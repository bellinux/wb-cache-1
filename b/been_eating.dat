5|$|In the Aleutian Islands, {{a massive}} and {{unexpected}} disappearance of sea otters {{has occurred in}} recent decades. In the 1980s, the area was home to an estimated 55,000 to 100,000 sea otters, but the population fell to around 6,000 animals by 2000. The most widely accepted, but still controversial, hypothesis is that killer whales have <b>been</b> <b>eating</b> the otters. The pattern of disappearances {{is consistent with a}} rise in predation, but there has been no direct evidence of orcas preying on sea otters to any significant extent.|$|E
5|$|Walder Frey {{celebrates the}} {{recapture}} of Riverrun with the Lannisters. Later, Walder eats dinner alone, wondering why his sons {{have yet to}} arrive. His servant reveals that she baked them into the meat pie he has <b>been</b> <b>eating,</b> and then removes her face to reveal that she is actually Arya Stark who then slits Walder's throat.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) convinces {{regional}} manager Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{that he needs}} to choose someone to act as an Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M.). Jim designs several Dwight-oriented challenges as tryouts for the position, and it is inevitably found that Dwight is the most qualified. Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) is forced to bring her child, Phillip, to work, after her daycare turns her child away. Dwight, upon overhearing that Phillip has <b>been</b> <b>eating</b> the type of paper which he himself regards as the most flavorful, begins to think that Angela's son is actually his. To test this theory, Dwight offers the child either a check for one million dollars or a beet; Phillip picks the beet. Dwight tells Angela that he will marry her if the child is his, but she denies that this is the case. Dwight then confers with Jim, asking whether he should propose to Angela or his girlfriend Esther, who he thinks is the more logical choice. Jim tells Dwight {{that he needs to}} put aside logic and follow his instincts. Dwight makes up his mind and proposes to Angela, who says yes. Angela finally reveals to Dwight that Phillip is indeed his son, explaining that she lied about his parentage in order to test Dwight's feelings for her.|$|E

A manĝanto is someone who <b>is</b> <b>eating.</b> A manĝinto <b>is</b> someone who <b>ate.</b> A manĝonto <b>is</b> someone who will eat. Also, a manĝito is someone who <b>was</b> <b>eaten,</b> a manĝato <b>is</b> someone who <b>is</b> being <b>eaten,</b> and a manĝoto is someone who will <b>be</b> <b>eaten.</b>|$|R

25|$|Moore {{was outside}} her house {{talking with the}} {{neighbor}} to whom she had already complained about Bonie's extortion efforts {{on the evening of}} July 31.

25|$|Beef is {{the culinary}} name for meat from cattle, {{particularly}} skeletal muscle. Humans have <b>been</b> <b>eating</b> beef since prehistoric times. Beef {{is a source}} of high-quality protein and essential nutrients. Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls is usually tougher, so it is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.|$|E
25|$|The show falls {{somewhere between}} a cop show and a comedy show. Although superficially {{following}} the police drama format, the comedy derives from outrageous plots, the self-deprecating Canadian and the assertive American stereotypes, and the occasional fantasy elements such as the regular visits paid to the Mountie by his father's ghost, whose advice varies between helpful and absurdly useless. The tone of the show {{and much of the}} comedy is derived from Fraser's supernormal detective ability. For instance, in one episode, Fraser tracks down a suspect by smelling the breath of a rat to determine the brand of barbecued ribs it had <b>been</b> <b>eating.</b> Another recurring gag is Fraser standing guard motionlessly in front of the Canadian consulate, while a passerby attempts to make him move or speak.|$|E
25|$|The next day, {{during the}} feast at his house, Titus asks Saturninus if a father should kill his {{daughter}} {{when she has}} been raped. When Saturninus answers that he should, Titus kills Lavinia and tells Saturninus of the rape. When the Emperor calls for Chiron and Demetrius, Titus reveals {{that they have been}} baked in the pie Tamora has just <b>been</b> <b>eating.</b> Titus then kills Tamora and is immediately killed by Saturninus, who is subsequently killed by Lucius to avenge his father's death. Lucius is then proclaimed Emperor. He orders that Saturninus be given a state burial, that Tamora's body be thrown to the wild beasts outside the city, and that Aaron be buried chest-deep and left to die of thirst and starvation. Aaron, however, is unrepentant to the end, regretting only that he had not done more evil in his life.|$|E

25|$|Boyd's lack {{of first}} team {{appearances}} prompted the newly appointed Hartlepool manager Neale Cooper to loan him to Boston United to gain match practice. During {{his time at}} Boston, Boyd won critical acclaim from Boston manager Neil Thompson and played a total of 14 matches scoring four goals before returning to Hartlepool. Boyd returned nine pounds overweight and looked set to leave Hartlepool United after angering Cooper. When asked about his weight gain, Boyd claimed that he had <b>been</b> <b>eating</b> more to build up his strength but when asked about gym work {{he said he had}} not started it yet. Boston looked set to make permanent deal for Boyd and made an offer for the striker. However, both teams failed to reach an agreement with Boston claiming that Hartlepool were asking far too much. It was rumoured that Hartlepool chairman, Ken Hodcroft, wanted a five figure sum, but Boston were only prepared to pay a four figure amount of around £5,000.|$|E
25|$|Bozděch elected {{instead to}} carry the dog instead rather than killing {{him as one of}} the others suggested, and after a while they began to take turns {{carrying}} Ant over their shoulders. They reached Blois and were directed to a train to Montpellier further down the track where found it overwhelmed with people trying to board. Ant shot off towards the rear of the train, before stopping by a cattle truck. Bozděch tried to open it up, but it was locked. He banged on it in the hope someone was already inside and was surprised when it was opened, revealing that the only people inside were a woman and her two daughters. The reason why Ant had been attracted to that particular carriage, was because one of the girls had <b>been</b> <b>eating</b> chocolate at the time. When she later offered him a piece, he didn't wait for it to be melted like when he was a puppy, but instead ate it excitedly.|$|E
25|$|The harvesting, processing, and {{consuming}} of seafoods are ancient {{practices with}} archaeological evidence dating back {{well into the}} Paleolithic. Findings in a sea cave at Pinnacle Point in South Africa indicate Homo sapiens (modern humans) harvested marine life as early as 165,000 years ago, while the Neanderthals, an extinct human species contemporary with early Homo sapiens, appear to have <b>been</b> <b>eating</b> seafood at sites along the Mediterranean coast beginning around the same time. Isotopic analysis of the skeletal remains of Tianyuan man, a 40,000-year-old modern human from eastern Asia, has shown that he regularly consumed freshwater fish. Archaeology features such as shell middens, discarded fish bones and cave paintings show that sea foods were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities. During this period, most people lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and were, of necessity, constantly on the move. However, where there are early examples of permanent settlements (though not necessarily permanently occupied) such as those at Lepenski Vir, they are almost always associated with fishing as {{a major source of}} food.|$|E

25|$|After {{dropping}} the nixies {{in a nearby}} pond (their reward for having sung to the giants), Jules, Laurie and Nick pass by Cindy's house and notice a large sinkhole close to it. When they go to warn Cindy and her parents, Laurie and Sandspur fall into the growing sinkhole and a tree falls on Jules's legs when attempting to rescue her. When Nick tries to help Laurie {{get out of the}} sinkhole, he finds that she still hadn't died from the methane exhaled by the dragons because Sandspur (who had grown to a huge size, revealing himself to be a spriggan) had <b>been</b> <b>eating</b> them, proceeding to eat Nick whole and only regurgitating him when Laurie drops rocks into the creature's mouth to make him sick. Nick and Laurie get out of the sinkhole and go back to meet Jack Jr. and the Grace kids, leaving Jules at Cindy's house waiting for an ambulance (being followed back by Sandspur, back in his small size, like nothing had happened).|$|E
500|$|Folklorists Iona and Peter Opie {{point out}} in The Classic Fairy Tales (1999) that the tale has a [...] "partial analogue" [...] in [...] "Snow White": the lost princess enters the dwarfs' house, tastes their food, and falls asleep {{in one of their}} beds. In a manner similar to the three bears, the dwarfs cry, [...] "Someone's been sitting in my chair!", [...] "Someone's <b>been</b> <b>eating</b> off my plate!", and [...] "Someone's been {{sleeping}} in my bed!" [...] The Opies also point to similarities in a Norwegian tale about a princess who takes refuge in a cave inhabited by three Russian princes dressed in bearskins.

500|$|Waters was {{reportedly}} reduced to tears {{by the sight}} of his former bandmate, who was asked by fellow visitor Andrew King how he had managed to gain so much weight. Barrett said he had a large refrigerator in his kitchen, and that he had <b>been</b> <b>eating</b> lots of pork chops. He also mentioned that he was ready to avail the band of his services, but while listening to the mix of [...] "Shine On", showed no signs of understanding its relevance to his plight. He joined the guests at Gilmour's wedding reception in the EMI canteen, but left without saying goodbye. None of the band members saw him from that day on until his death in 2006. Although the lyrics had already been created, Barrett's presence on that day may have influenced the final part of the song – a subtle refrain performed by Wright from [...] "See Emily Play" [...] is audible {{towards the end of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|The story makes {{extensive}} use of the literary rule of three, featuring three chairs, three bowls of porridge, three beds, and the three title characters {{who live in the}} house. There are also three sequences of the bears discovering in turn that someone has <b>been</b> <b>eating</b> from their porridge, sitting in their chairs, and finally, lying in their beds, at which point is the climax of Goldilocks being discovered. This follows three earlier sequences of Goldilocks trying the bowls of porridge, chairs, and beds successively, each time finding the third [...] "just right". Author Christopher Booker characterizes this as the [...] "dialectical three", where [...] "the first is wrong in one way, the second in another or opposite way, and only the third, in the middle, is just right." [...] Booker continues [...] "This idea that the way forward lies in finding an exact middle path between opposites is of extraordinary importance in storytelling". This concept has spread across many other disciplines, particularly developmental psychology, biology, economics and engineering where it is called the [...] "Goldilocks Principle".|$|E
