DETAILED DESCRIPTION - <b>A</b> <b>powder</b> {{spray arrangement}} has <b>a</b> <b>powder</b> channel (4) for transporting <b>a</b> <b>powder</b> gas mixture, which opens out into a nozzle opening for distributing the powder-gas mixture {{in the form of a}} cloud. The channel has a triboelectric active surface which allows the powder to be charged up with a primary polarity. A corona electrode (3) is located before or after the active surface, so a secondary polarity can be produced. The powder channel is in the form of a ring gap or channel and at least one corona electrode is located behind the nozzle opening. A distribution member is located behind the nozzle opening and the corona electrode voltage can be controlled. The triboelectric material is e. g. polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (which produces a positive charge) or polyamide (which produces a negative charge). USE - For use as <b>a</b> <b>powder</b> spraying unit. ADVANTAGE - The powder is charged effectively...|$|R
50|$|A paste or gel {{might become}} <b>a</b> <b>powder</b> {{after it has}} been {{thoroughly}} dried, but is not considered <b>a</b> <b>powder</b> when it is wet because it does not flow freely. Substances like dried clay, although dry bulk solids composed of very fine particles, are not powders unless they are crushed because they have too much cohesion between the grains, and therefore they do not flow freely like <b>a</b> <b>powder.</b> <b>A</b> liquid flows differently than <b>a</b> <b>powder,</b> because <b>a</b> liquid cannot resist any shear stress and therefore it cannot reside at a tilted angle without flowing (that is, it has zero angle of repose.) <b>A</b> <b>powder</b> on the other hand is a solid, not a liquid, because it may support shear stresses and therefore may display an angle of repose.|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{investigation}} into the dependence of the thermal conductivity of <b>a</b> <b>powder</b> on its particle size is described. Measurements of the conductivity of six aluminium powders with interstitial air pressure from atmospheric to 10 (^- 5) cm. Hg, are reported. The conductivity of <b>a</b> <b>powder</b> is constant at higher pressures until the mean free path of the molecules of the gas becomes comparable {{to the size of the}} pore spaces of the powder. The conductivity then decreases with decreasing pressure to a small asymptotic value at low pressures. These results accord with those of previous workers. Measurements of conductivity with varying temperature are also reported and it is concluded that the heat transfer is due to conduction and that convection and radiative heat transfer are not important. The differences in conductivity of the six powders are explained by considering the mean particle size and the porosity of the <b>powders.</b> <b>A</b> finer <b>powder</b> tends to have a low conductivity because a temperature discontinuity can exist at each solid-gas interface. <b>A</b> <b>powder</b> which packstto: at high porosity also tends to have a low conductivity because the thermal resistance of <b>a</b> <b>powder</b> is duo to the presence of the voids. It is shown that the porosity of <b>a</b> packed <b>powder</b> depends on its particle size distribution and it is concluded, therefore, that the conductivity of <b>a</b> <b>powder</b> depends on both the mean particle size and the size distribution. This hypothesis is confirmed by further measurements on mixtures of two of the aluminium powders...|$|R
