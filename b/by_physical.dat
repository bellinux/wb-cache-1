5|$|A {{migraine}} is {{a primary}} headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe. Typically, the headaches affect {{one half of the}} head, are pulsating in nature, and last from two to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> activity.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{pneumothorax}} is {{one that}} occurs without an apparent cause {{and in the absence}} of significant lung disease, while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung disease. Smoking increases the risk as do lung diseases including COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis. A pneumothorax can also be caused <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> trauma to the chest (including a blast injury), or as a complication of a healthcare intervention; in which case it is called a traumatic pneumothorax.|$|E

5|$|Archaea {{usually have}} a single {{circular}} chromosome, {{with as many as}} 5,751,492base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the largest known archaeal genome. The tiny 490,885base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> contact, in a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation.|$|E
5|$|Attacks may {{be brought}} on <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> exertion, {{drinking}} alcohol, or eating food high in carbohydrates or salt. This {{may explain why}} attacks are more common in summer, when more people drink sugary drinks and engage in exercise. Exercise-related attacks tend to occur {{during a period of}} rest immediately after exercise; exercise may therefore be recommended to abort an attack.|$|E
5|$|Buddhist teachings {{describe}} {{that the mind}} manifests moment to moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing. The moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream {{has been described as}} happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain. The manifestation of the mind-stream is also described as being influenced <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.|$|E

5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> examination {{alone can}} be difficult (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions that can result in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup {{of blood in the}} pleural space), pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. A large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{innovation}} {{may sometimes}} begin in Lamarckian style with epigenetic alterations of gene regulation or phenotype generation, subsequently consolidated by {{changes at the}} gene level. Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation, as well as nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> and other environmental effects due to the inherent plasticity of developmental mechanisms. The biologists Stuart A. Newman and Gerd B. Müller have suggested that organisms early {{in the history of}} multicellular life were more susceptible to this second category of epigenetic determination than are modern organisms, providing a basis for early macroevolutionary changes.|$|E

5|$|Palmer {{gained an}} anti-settler {{reputation}} among immigrants, newspapers and officials, {{who said he}} acted too favorably toward the Indians, even though he moved the tribes to reservations outside the Willamette Valley, seeking to avoid friction between settlers and natives <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> distance. In late 1855, while moving the Rogue River tribes to the Grand Ronde Reservation, violent resistance was threatened by settlers who felt the land should not {{be given to the}} tribes. Palmer succeeded, but the territorial legislature petitioned for his removal from office, which became effective in 1857.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonary plethysmographs {{are used}} to measure {{functional}} residual capacity. Functional residual capacity cannot be measured by tests that rely on breathing out, as a person is only able to breathe a maximum of 80% of their total functional capacity. The total lung capacity depends on the person's age, height, weight, and sex, and normally ranges between 4 and 6 litres. Females {{tend to have a}} 20–25% lower capacity than males. Tall people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people. Smokers have a lower capacity than nonsmokers. Thinner persons tend to have a larger capacity, and capacity can be increased <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> training as much as 40%.|$|E
5|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} {{are most often}} caused <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> trauma. Forces involved can be hyperflexion (forward movement of the head); hyperextension (backward movement); lateral stress (sideways movement); rotation (twisting of the head); compression (force along the axis of the spine downward from the head or upward from the pelvis); or distraction (pulling apart of the vertebrae). Traumatic SCI can result in contusion, compression, or stretch injury. It is a major risk of many types of vertebral fracture. Pre-existing asymptomatic congenital anomalies can cause major neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis, to result from otherwise minor trauma.|$|E

5|$|The laws {{of physics}} apply the abstractions of {{mathematics}} to the real world, often {{as if it were}} perfect. For example, a crystal is perfect when it has no structural defects such as dislocations and is fully symmetric. Exact mathematical perfection can only approximate real objects. Visible patterns in nature are governed <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> laws; for example, meanders can be explained using fluid dynamics.|$|E
5|$|The {{other type}} of solids is weak {{molecular}} crystals (e.g., fluorocarbons, hydrocarbons, etc.) where the molecules are held together essentially <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> forces (e.g., van der Waals and hydrogen bonds). Since these solids are held together by weak forces, a very low input of energy is required to break them, thus they are termed “low energy”. Depending {{on the type of}} liquid chosen, low-energy surfaces can permit either complete or partial wetting.|$|E
5|$|A {{strain of}} truly domesticated red foxes was {{introduced}} by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E

5|$|Even {{people with}} {{complete}} SCI, in whom {{the spinal cord}} cannot transmit any messages past {{the level of the}} lesion, can achieve orgasm. In 1960, in one of the earliest studies to look at orgasm and SCI, the term phantom orgasm was coined to describe women's perception of orgasmic sensations despite SCI—but subsequent studies have suggested the experience is not merely psychological. Men with complete SCI report sexual sensations at the time of ejaculation, accompanied <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> signs normally found at orgasm, such as increased blood pressure. Women can experience orgasm with vibration to the cervix regardless of level or completeness of injury; the sensation is the same as uninjured women experience.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water quality {{monitoring}} and improvement the river is divided into several catchment management areas; South of Malmesbury, Bristol Avon Rural and Bristol Avon Urban. In the rural area 22 water bodies are classified as good, 46 as moderated and 8 as poor. The main reasons for not achieving good scores are pollution from waste water, agriculture and rural land management. In the urban area one water body is rated good, while 12 are rated moderate and one is poor. The pollution from upstream is added to by the effects of industry, manufacturing and other businesses and is significantly affected <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> modifications to the water course. Within the catchment area there are 137 river water bodies and 6 lakes; of these 22 percent of rivers are rated as good ecological status, 40 percent good for chemical status and 31 percent good for biological status.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal Universe governed <b>by</b> <b>physical</b> laws were first {{proposed}} by the Greeks and Indians. Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the Universe including both all of space and all of time. Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. The modern era of cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity, which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the Universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted Big Bang.|$|E
