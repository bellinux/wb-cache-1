40|$|Motivated by {{the ideas}} of {{analogue}} gravity, we have performed experiments in a flume where an analogue White Hole horizon is generated, {{in the form of}} a wave blocking region, by suitably tuned uniform fluid (water) flow and counter-propagating shallow water waves. We corroborate earlier experimental observations by finding a critical wave frequency for a particular discharge above which the waves are effectively blocked beyond the horizon. An obstacle, {{in the form of a}} bottom wave, is introduced to generate a sharp <b>blocking</b> <b>zone.</b> All previous researchers used this obstacle. A novel part of our experiment is where we do not introduce the obstacle and find that wave blocking still takes place, albeit in a more diffused zone. Lastly we replace the fixed bottom wave obstacle by a movable sand bed to study the sediment transport and the impact of the horizon or wave blocking phenomenon on the sediment profile. We find signatures of the wave <b>blocking</b> <b>zone</b> in the ripple pattern. Comment: 19 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{pretreatment}} of raw seawater {{is necessary}} to minimize the organic fouling of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes. To predict the membrane fouling of the pretreated seawater,the modified fouling index (MFI) A with ultrafiltration (UF) was investigated in terms of molecular weight distribution (MWD) and membrane characterization. The {{study was conducted with}} seawater drawn from Collioure, France. The concentration of total dissolved solids was 32, 760 mg/L. The molecular weight (MW) of the initial seawater organic matter (SWOM) ranged from about 14, 160 Da to 280 Da. FeCl(3) flocculation removed the majority of SWOM, while PAC adsorption could not remove the lowest MW fraction of organic matter (1110, 750 and 280 Da). The UF membranes with 30 kDa and 100 kDa MW cut-off removed the majority of of organic matter corresponding to the peaks 14, 160 Da and 6560 Da in MWD. The MFI values obtained when using UF membranes of 30 kDa and 100 kDa with MF pretreatment were 19, 700 s/L(2) and 31, 000 s/L(2), respectively. The MFI values after pretreatments of FeCl(3) flocculation and PAC adsorption significantly decreased to 6900 s/L(2) and 6700 for 30 kDa UF and to 2300 s/L(2) and 2500 s/L(2) for 100 kDa UF, respectively. Some relation does exist for both membranes between the MFI-UF values and S(pb) values obtained during the first peiod of filtration (pore blocking). The pore <b>blocking</b> <b>zone</b> significantly decreased after flocculation and adsorption pretreatment. This Suggests that the pore blocking can be used as an indicator to predict membrane propensity. The detailed membrane characterization on the clean and fouled membrane surface after MFI-UF experiments was made in terms of contact angle, zeta potential, functional group and microscopyclose 131...|$|E

30|$|For {{the design}} of the {{reinforced}} form block walls, the structural capacity of the walls against compression and shear force should be determined. In particular, the compression capacity of the walls whose hollow <b>block</b> <b>zones</b> are filled with grouted concrete allows the walls to function as braces on frames with the compression strut under the horizontal load, and therefore becomes the most important structural capacity. Therefore, for {{the design of}} the new construction of the form block and for seismic retrofit, it is essential to predict the appropriate compression structure of block walls.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{simplest}} reasons many teams have incorporated <b>zone</b> <b>blocking</b> in their offenses is that <b>zone</b> <b>blocking</b> rules do not change based on the defensive front. In a [...] "man block" [...] system, blockers are paired with defenders according to certain rules to create a running lane. If the defensive front changes, or if the defense stunts or blitzes, the blocking rules may change. This requires learning multiple rules for the same play. <b>Zone</b> <b>blocking</b> uses very consistent rules that do not change according to the defensive front.|$|R

These methods can either supervise or substitute existing zone 3 relays, although further work is required {{in the area of}} communication redundancy [39].

The discussion is performed with the beta-plane model for a spherical geometry and a large number of degrees of freedom. The barotropic potential vorticity equation is defined, and discretization of the topography of the sphere results in a spectral truncation with 25 components. The solutions are generated as a function of a forcing and a dissipative parameter. The model yields steady, periodic, and aperiodic solutions, which are shown to be analogous to zonal and blocked atmospheric flows...|$|R

50|$|The Carolina Panthers {{made the}} switch to <b>zone</b> <b>blocking</b> under {{offensive}} coordinator Jeff Davidson for the 2007 season. They had previously employed a man-blocking scheme for a downhill running attack under coordinator Dan Henning, but during the 2006 season, the team's undersized linemen were consistently overpowered by opposing defensive linemen. The power running game became stagnant, and especially ineffective in goal-line/short yardage situations, thus resulting in Henning's firing and {{the switch to}} <b>zone</b> <b>blocking.</b> Thanks {{in part to the}} new blocking scheme they implemented, the Panthers saw their 2008 campaign characterized by the running of DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart to great effect, gaining them play off status.

50|$|<b>Zone</b> <b>blocking</b> is a {{technique}} that is a simple and effective scheme for creating lanes for running plays. In a <b>zone</b> <b>blocking</b> scheme, fleet-footedness and athletic ability trump size as desirable qualities in offensive linemen.

In this blocking scheme, which takes much from the Veer blocking system, creating movement on the defensive line is more important than opening a specific hole in the defense.|$|R
