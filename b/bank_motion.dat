40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we propose}} a new method for {{supervised}} motion segmen-tation based on spatial-frequential analysis and dimension reduction techniques. A sequence of images could contain non-ridge {{motion in the}} region of interest and the segmentation of these moving objects with deformation is challenging. The aim is to extract feature vectors that capture the spatial-frequential information in the training set and then to monitor the variations of the feature vectors over time in the test set. Given successive images in the training set, we consider a dynamic model that extends the sliced inverse regression in Li (1991). It is designed to capture the intrinsic dimension of feature vectors that holds over a local time scale. These projected features are then used to classify training images and predict forthcoming images in the test set into distinct categories. Theoretic properties are addressed. Simulation studies and clinical studies of a sequence of magnetic resonance images are reported, which confirm the practical feasibility of this new approach. Key words and phrases: Dimension reduction, Gabor filter <b>bank,</b> <b>motion</b> segmen-tation, non-ridge motion, sliced inverse regression, spatial-frequential analysis. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} issue in tracking {{is how to}} incorporate an appropriate degree of adaptivity into the observation model. Without any adaptivity, tracking fails when object properties change, for example when illumination changes affect surface colour. Conversely, if an observation model adapts too readily then, during some transient failure of tracking, it is liable to adapt erroneously to {{some part of the}} background. The approach proposed here is to adapt selectively, allowing adaptation only during periods when two particular conditions are met: that the object should be both present and in motion. The proposed mechanism for adaptivity is tested here with a foreground colour and motion model. The experimental setting itself is novel in that it uses combined colour and motion observations from a fixed filter <b>bank,</b> with <b>motion</b> used also for initialisation via a Monte Carlo proposal distribution. Adaptation is performed using a stochastic EM algorithm, during periods that meet the conditions above. Tests verify the value of such adaptivity, in that immunity to distraction from clutter of similar colour to the object is considerably enhanced. ...|$|R

40|$|Local motion {{signals are}} {{extracted}} in parallel by a <b>bank</b> of <b>motion</b> detectors, and their spatiotemporal interactions are processed in subsequent stages. In this talk, I will review our recent studies on spatial interactions in visual motion processing. First, we found {{two types of}} spatial pooling of local motion signals. Directionally ambiguous 1 D local motion signals are pooled across orientation and space for solution of the aperture problem, while 2 D local motion signals are pooled for estimation of global vector average (e. g., Amano et al., 2009 Journal of Vision 9 (3 : 4) 1 – 25). Second, when stimulus presentation is brief, coherent motion detection of dynamic random-dot kinematogram is not efficient. Nevertheless, it is significantly improved by transient and synchronous presentation of a stationary surround pattern. This suggests that centre-surround spatial interaction may help rapid perception of motion (Linares et al., submitted). Third, {{to know how the}} visual system encodes pairwise relationships between remote motion signals, we measured the temporal rate limit for perceiving the relationship of two motion directions presented at the same time at different spatial locations. Compared with similar tasks with luminance or orientation signals, motion comparison was more rapid and hence efficient. This high performance was affected little by inter-element separation even when it was increased up to 100 deg. These findings indicate the existence of specialized processes to encode long-range relationships between motion signals for quick appreciation of global dynamic scene structure (Maruya et al., in preparation) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{recently developed}} digital dance scores, paying {{particular attention to}} Using the Sky (<b>Motion</b> <b>Bank</b> 2013), an online score of Deborah Hay’s work No Time to Fly (2010) I suggest that Using the Sky is typical of an emerging field of choreographic ‘poetics’ (Cvejic 2012, deLahunta 2014), which offer a form of co-authored self-reflection, drawing on multiple methods to analyse and share choreographic processes. UTS and similar projects shape the legacy of dance works, constraining their identity in accordance with authorial intention and centralising the choreographer’s voice. This impacts on empirical and post-structuralist notions of authorship, implicating a shift away from established paradigms and reconfiguring spectator – author relations. Furthermore Hay’s somatic practice poses a familiar challenge regarding {{the presence of the}} body when writing (about) dance. This investigation suggests that the methods adopted by Hay and her team allow for features of the body to extend into the digital realm.

40|$|Abstract: Bouguer gravity {{anomalies}} {{together with}} deep seismic reflection and magnetic data {{on both sides}} of the North Atlantic are used to locate the hinge zones of the Flemish Cap and Galicia Bank within the Iberian and North American plates, regions across which there were abrupt changes in lithospheric extension. The characteristic shape and alignment of these hinge zones suggest that they were conjugate features generated during chrons M 25 –M 0 (Late Jurassic– Early Aptian) around a distally located Euler pole of rotation. Rifting between Iberia and North America involved these two larger plates and the two smaller microplates – the Flemish Cap and Galicia <b>Bank</b> microplates. The <b>motion</b> of the microplates, which were adjacent to Eurasia, was much more complex than those of the larger plates. The motion between the microplates from chron M 25 or older to chron M 0 was complicated by the fact that they remained attached to each other for most of the time when regions to the south were rifting apart. As a result, con-tinental regions landward of these segments were subjected to extension that created the Orphan and Flemish Pass basins on the North American side and the Galicia Interior Basin on the Iberian side. By comparing the hinge zones delineated off Galicia Bank and Flemish Cap using the Bouguer anomalies, we were able to infer that Flemish Cap rotated approximately 438 relativ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionKnee dislocations {{are defined}} as {{ligament}} injuries involving {{at least two of}} the four most important knee ligaments. Results from recent studies have shown a tendency towards improvement of the functional outcomes with use of an articulated external fixator during the postoperative period following multiligament reconstruction. Our hypothesis was that good knee stability and early gain of range of motion could be achieved with the use of the external fixator after ligament reconstructions. MethodsFourteen patients with knee dislocations were evaluated after multiligament reconstruction in association with use of a lateral monoplanar external fixator for six weeks. Reconstructions were performed using grafts from a tissue <b>bank.</b> Range of <b>motion</b> was measured after one, two, three, six, twelve months and at the final evaluation at a mean time of 49 months. The assessments were made using objective and subjective IKDC, Lysholm and Tegner scales. ResultsThe mean scores were 71. 7 for the subjective IKDC score, 81. 5 for the Lysholm score. No patient was able to return to previous Tegner score. Out of the 45 ligament reconstructions performed, only four failed during the follow-up time. The mean range of motion of the knee presented a progressive increase from the first to the twelfth month, from 67. 8 ° to 115. 7 °. Two cases of superficial infection on the site of the external fixator pins were observed. ConclusionThe use of an external fixator enabled early rehabilitation with range of motion gains starting from the first postoperative month, a low rate of reconstruction failure and minimal complications. Nevertheless, none of the patients returned to the level of activity prevailing prior to the injury. Level of evidenceLevel IV, retrospective therapeutic case series...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the contemporary phenomenon of motion capture-based renderings of dance. By taking Nancy Stark Smith's hieroglyphs and <b>Motion</b> <b>Bank's</b> digital score Using the Sky (that explores Deborah Hay's score No Time to Fly) as main examples, a comparison is drawn between analogue and digital traces of dance that both rely on principles of capture instead of following a symbolic notation system. Although one is created by an ink pen and the other by a motion capture (MoCap) apparatus, these different types of drawing display some striking similarities. At {{the same time there}} are some fundamental differences in the ontological basis of these images, which affects {{the way in which we}} relate to these images and how they invite us to understand dance. Whereas the role of the dancing body as ‘drawing instrument’ remains present, this metaphor manifests itself in a different way in its digital surroundings. By analysing the meaning-making agents that are involved when a dancer is recorded in a motion capture setting and by relating the resulting imagery to relevant theoretical notions, such as ‘phenomenal dance image’ (Stewart), ‘flickering signifiers’ (Hayles), ‘gesturo-haptic media’ (Rotman) and ‘rightness of rendering’ (Goodman), the article traces preliminary answers to two central questions: What do these traces of dance depict? And who is doing the drawing? This article shows how motion capture practices in contemporary dance offer us opportunities to create new worlds through which we may start to know dance differently: artistically, by creating new phenomenal images of dance; analytically, by gaining insight in spatial and rhythmical patterns; and gesturo-haptically, by offering the radical opportunity to re-enact movement through mapping it on to other bodies...|$|R
40|$|Both {{inside and}} outside theatre, body work is the first and {{principle}} aspect of work on the ‘self’. It is the first inescapable step in the path toward the aware action which in theatre is the “action in perception”, i. e. thinking-in-movement. This aware thought involves the whole background of the person. It is an action that arises only when the person is present {{and at the same}} time dynamically involved entirely in the environment: it is the perceptual consciousness that integrates the planning of the action with the execution of the same action. “Thinking-in-movement” is a dynamic process that is not possible to be codified: it is a language that asks to be experienced in order to be able to be understood and learned. Therefore, what is the Score? Is it a concept, a method of movement, or a digital tool? Perhaps it is each one of these things. The Score is an indispensable algorithm to read the dance that the human writes in order to obtain information, transfer them and so continue in the evolution of the body knowledge. The Score is the medium in which the human being structured tensions are shaped: i. e., an alternative site to understand the potential instigation of the human body and the organization of his residual actions. In this article I will read the score like a crystal: metaphor of the shaped dynamism innate in the expressive movement. I will explain how this crystal is the necessary channel to make sure the choreographic counterpoint can show up during the live performance. I will explore what this means for the choreographers involved in <b>Motion</b> <b>Bank</b> - William Forsythe, Deborah Hay, Jonathan Burrows and Matteo Fargion - analyzing the somatic connections between their dance-making and the score-creation...|$|R
40|$|Existing seismic 			risk in Pakistan, {{especially}} in its Northern Areas, emphasis for a 			detailed and careful design of RC structures to withstand expected 			earthquake loads. The seismic performance of RC multistory 			structures {{is a complex}} process. An accurate assessment of seismic 			behavior of RC structures requires an analysis carried out under 			time history or parameters of time history of real time recorded 			earthquakes. In Pakistan, a large data <b>bank</b> of strong <b>motion</b> 			recorders exists in analog form, and its use in performance 			assessment of structures is very difficult without digitizing it. 			The response of a multistory RC building is greatly dependant on 			performance of its columns {{especially in}} inelastic range, which can 			be improved by providing sufficient confinement. Post earthquake 			surveys revealed {{that most of the}} RC buildings collapsed due to 			insufficient performance of their columns, which were found 			deficient in confinement. A limited work has been carried out in 			Pakistan to study the performance of RC columns under axial and 			lateral loading. Internationally, the efforts are continued to 			enhance the performance of RC columns subjected to seismic loads. 			The objective of this research has three main parts. The first part 			is to collect, segregate and digitize available analog form of 			earthquake data, which has been recorded in Pakistan. The second 			part is to device and test a technique which could enhance strength, 			ductility and stiffness of RC columns subjected to seismic loads and 			result in lesser residual deformations. The third part is to carry 			out seismic analysis of a RC multistory frame, using material 			behavior studied experimentally, under application of ground motion 			data of Pakistan. 			A novel digitizing technique is developed in this study that 			extracts the trace of recorded acceleration as a whole by saving all 			points required to draw digitized ground acceleration. The proposed 			digitizing approach has been compared with the available techniques 			to assess its efficiency. 			The confinement technique for RC columns developed in this study 			utilizes specialized rings of steel strips applied as transverse 			reinforcement in hinge zone. Eight large scale specimens have been 			cast and tested to study the performance of proposed technique. The 			experimental results indicated that proposed confining 			reinforcement, although with lesser volumetric ratio, improved the 			performance of RC columns by enhancing their shear resistance, 			ductility, energy dissipation capacity and reducing residual 			deformations. The columns confined by proposed technique have been 			named as Steel Strip Confined (SSC) columns. The observed column 			behavior has been modeled in Response- 2000 and DRAIN- 3 DX. 			RC frames are modeled in DRAIN- 3 DX using material properties 			calibrated with experimental data.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{examines}} {{the way in}} which spectatorial relationship with certain dance works is reconfigured through emerging practices for documenting, analysing and ‘scoring’ dance, paying particular attention to the role of digital technology. I examine three central case studies, developed between 2009 and 2013, which are outcomes of major research projects, these are; Synchronous Objects for One Flat Thing, reproduced (Forsythe and OSU 2009), Using the Sky (Hay and <b>Motion</b> <b>Bank</b> 2013) and A Choreographer’s Score: Fase, Rosas danst Rosas, Elena’s Aria, Bartók (De Keersmaeker and Cvejić 2012). These ‘scores’ fall under the title of ‘choreographic objects’, a term which, following Leach, deLahunta and Whatley (2008) I use to refer to collaboratively produced, artist-­‐led objects that utilise technology in various ways, to explore and disseminate choreographic processes. Focussing on western contemporary theatre dance practices and drawing on discourses from Dance Studies, Performance Studies, Philosophical Aesthetics and Digital Theory, I consider how ‘choreographic objects’ pose philosophical questions regarding the ways in which audiences access, interpret, appreciate and value works, examining the evolving role of the score in issues of identity and ontology. I also consider the score-­‐like nature of these objects, drawing comparisons with codified movement notations, such as Labanotation, developed by Hungarian dance theorist Rudolf von Laban (1879 – 1958). The case studies pose many queries, however the central focus of this research is on three key questions; what are ‘choreographic objects’? How do they reconfigure spectatorial engagement with specific dance works? And, how does this reconfiguration encourage a rethinking of their ontological statuses? The case studies demonstrate an increased interest in the articulation, examination and dissemination of choreographic process. In recent years many artists, based primarily in Europe and the USA, such as Siobhan Davies (1950 -­‐), Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker (1960 -­‐), William Forsythe (1949 -­‐), Emio Greco (1965 -­‐), Steve Paxton (1939 -­‐); have teamed up with researchers and technologists to develop digital, or partially digital objects which examine and articulate their choreographic processes. deLahunta (2013 b) suggests that together these artists give rise to a ‘community of practice’. This is a notion formulated by Etienne Wenger (1998) to describe groups of people who are engaged in collective learning, including, for example, “a band of artists seeking new forms of expression” (Wenger 2006 : 1). The shared interest in cultivating new ways to express choreographic process generates a form of community between these artists. The objects generated through these investigations are labelled ‘scores’, ‘archives’ and ‘installations’, however, each one problematises their categorical label, thus generating the rubric of ‘choreographic objects’; an emerging class of object which both crosses and defies existing modes of description. The circulation of ‘choreographic objects’ is relatively new therefore a detailed examination of their ontology, function and impact provides a significant theoretical and practical contribution to current dance discourses and practice. This research contextualises these objects, situating them socio-­‐culturally and examining the motivations and repercussions. The ontological probing considers the nature of the objects and their impact on the way we perceive and conceptualise the notion of the dance ‘work’...|$|R
