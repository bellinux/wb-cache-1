5|$|Over {{the course}} of his life, Rakoto Frah was commemorated by fellow artists and by the {{government}} of Madagascar, which issued him numerous awards and commendations throughout his career. The design for the 1,000Malagasy franc (200ariary) banknote first printed by the Central Bank in 1983 depicted Rakoto Frah dressed in a traditional straw hat and lamba and playing the sodina. He is the only artist to have been featured on a Malagasy banknote. According to a representative of the Central Bank, the artist was selected because he was the most representative of the Malagasy identity. After the Rakoto Frah <b>banknote</b> <b>design</b> was discontinued in the 1990s it became a rare collector's item valued in 2011 at over 100,000ariary, more than 500 times its face value. The artist was also invited by international filmmakers to feature in two French films: the Madagascar documentary L'Ile Rouge released in 1992 by French director Jean-Michel Carré, and an eponymous documentary about the artist himself, produced by director Camille Marchand in 1997.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} security of the substrate and the integration of security features in the <b>banknote</b> <b>designs,</b> the Bank of Canada also launched a public education campaign, actively deterred counterfeiting by closer collaboration with law enforcement, and accelerated the removal and destruction of banknotes from older series from circulation.

50|$|Nicolaas van der Waay (15 October 1855, Amsterdam - 18 December 1936, Amsterdam) was a Dutch {{decorative}} artist, watercolorist and lithographer.

50|$|The <b>banknote</b> <b>design</b> {{contains}} distinct colours {{for each}} denomination, and large numerals on the obverse and reverse of each denomination, {{both of which}} facilitate quick identification.

On the reverse, vertical bars adjacent to the serial number are used by banknote sorting machines for quick identification to enable high-speed sorting.|$|E
5000|$|The {{banknote}} {{was designed}} and redesigned by Giedrius Jonaitis. The very first draft of new Lithuanian currency had Darius and Girėnas on the 5 litai banknote. It was released in different designs four times (in 1993 (twice), 1997, and 2001). The first <b>banknote</b> <b>design</b> started an international scandal. In 1992, these banknotes were printed and ready to be released to the public. However, {{it was discovered that}} they were virtually unprotected against counterfeiting. It delayed the introduction of the litas as the banknotes had to be reprinted. The banknotes bearing the date [...] "1991" [...] were released for a very short time and were quickly replaced by the 1993 issue. The major design ideas have not changed throughout the issues.|$|E

25|$|Officials {{started to}} prepare for the {{introduction}} of the litas even before independence was declared, it was thought to introduce the litas alongside the ruble even if Lithuania remained a part of the Soviet Union. In December 1989, artists were asked to submit sketches of possible coin and <b>banknote</b> <b>designs.</b> Also, a list of famous people was compiled in order to determine who should be featured.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design process}} for this series began in 1963 with a {{primary goal of}} {{creating}} banknotes that were more counterfeit-resistant than the 1954 Series it was to replace. The Bank of Canada requested design submissions from security printing companies, receiving several from both domestic and foreign companies. One proposed design was received from Organisation Giori, a Swiss security printer based in Lausanne that had developed a multicolour printing press [...] "that raised the bar on <b>banknote</b> security". Its <b>designs</b> for the $10 and $20 banknotes were a [...] "significant departure" [...] from traditional Canadian <b>banknote</b> <b>designs</b> by incorporating more colours, new graphic elements, and different security features, but the design was rejected. Final conceptual designs were created by Canadian Bank Note Company, British American Bank Note Company, and De La Rue, the latter being the first foreign firm involved in the <b>design</b> of Canadian <b>banknotes.</b> The <b>design</b> by De La Rue was selected by the Bank of Canada in 1964 {{as the basis for}} the new series.|$|R
