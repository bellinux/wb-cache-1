5|$|Richards {{made his}} Test debut against India in November 1974, and scored his maiden Test century {{during the second}} Test of the same tour, scoring an unbeaten 192 in the first-innings of the match.

He scored his maiden double century in the first Test of that year's tour of England at Trent Bridge, Nottingham making 232. After scoring a century in the third Test, he once again scored a double century in the fifth Test, accumulating his highest score, 291, at The Oval, London. These centuries, {{and a total of}} 1,710 Test runs in the year, helped him to be named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1977. In 1986, facing England at the Antigua Recreation Ground, Richards scored the fastest century in Test cricket, reaching his twentieth Test hundred in 56 balls. Richards has the third-highest number of centuries for the West Indies, behind Brian Lara's 34 and Sobers' 26.|$|E

At {{the start of the}} series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence. The character's initial haughty and often cruel manner begins to soften after his years of imprisonment {{at the start of the}} series, but the challenge of undoing past sins and changing old ways is an enormous one for a being who has <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> his ways for billions of years. In its beginnings, the series is a very dark horror comic. Later, the series evolves into an elaborate fantasy series, incorporating elements of classical and contemporary mythology, ultimately placing its protagonist in the role of a tragic hero.|$|E

5|$|The concept art {{as well as}} the game's codename, Horizon, were leaked in September 2014. Horizon Zero Dawn {{was officially}} {{announced}} during Sony Interactive Entertainment's E3 2015 press conference. The game was featured as the cover story in the September 2015 issue of Edge and the October 2016 issue of Game Informer. At E3 2016, Sony had a life-sized cosplay version of one of the machines greet the trade show attendees. Originally set to be released in 2016, the game was later delayed to February 2017 so as to give additional time for the development team to polish the game. It was released to manufacturing in late January 2017. The game launched to North American markets on 28 February 2017, in Europe on 1 March and Asia on 2 March for the PlayStation 4. Horizon Zero Dawn is forward compatible with the PS4 Pro, allowing it to run up to 4K resolution. In April 2017, a 47-minute documentary about the making of Horizon Zero Dawn was released by Dutch public television. By March 2017, a story expansion had already <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> motion.

5|$|The match {{began in}} similar fashion to the earlier contest; the Non-Smokers won the toss, and their captain Arthur Shrewsbury chose to bat first. The Smokers, led by the Australian Harry Boyle, walked onto the pitch smoking cigars. Despite the strong bowling attack boasted by the Smokers, which {{included}} Johnny Briggs and George Lohmann, the Non-Smokers took advantage of a good batting wicket and accrued 196 runs before the first wicket fell, that of William Bruce for 131. Billy Bates was dismissed shortly thereafter for four, bringing in Billy Gunn. Shrewsbury and Gunn batted together {{for the rest of}} the day, and the following morning, building a partnership of 310 runs; Shrewsbury was eventually caught off the bowling of Briggs for 236, while Gunn was bowled by Boyle for 150. Fifties from Richard Houston, Harry Musgrove and Jack Worrall in the middle-order boosted the score to 803, a new record for the highest innings total in first-class cricket. The previous record, 775 runs, had also <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> Australia, by New South Wales. The score fell some way short of the highest innings score in any cricket, which was believed to have been the 920 scored by Orleans Club against Rickling Green in 1882. The score has since been surpassed over twenty times.|$|E
5|$|The play is {{sometimes}} given a historical setting, enabling audiences {{to reflect on}} the underlying conflicts. For example, adaptations have <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> the midst of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, in the apartheid era in South Africa, and {{in the aftermath of the}} Pueblo Revolt. Similarly, Peter Ustinov's 1956 comic adaptation, Romanoff and Juliet, is set in a fictional mid-European country in the depths of the Cold War. A mock-Victorian revisionist version of Romeo and Juliet final scene (with a happy ending, Romeo, Juliet, Mercutio, and Paris restored to life, and Benvolio revealing that he is Paris's love, Benvolia, in disguise) forms part of the 1980 stage-play The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby. Shakespeare's R, by Joe Calarco, spins the classic in a modern tale of gay teenage awakening. A recent comedic musical adaptation was The Second City's The Second City's Romeo and Juliet Musical: The People vs. Friar Laurence, the Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet, set in modern times.|$|E
