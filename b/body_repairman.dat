50|$|Stephens, the {{youngest}} of three children and the only boy, was born in Brookline, Massachusetts to William and Claire Stephens and raised in Somerville, Massachusetts, several miles west of Boston. Stephens' father was a long-distance truck driver and his mother worked {{in the restaurant business}} in the Boston area. Stephens frequently accompanied his father on various truck trips as a child which helped to fuel his interest in automobiles. According to family members, at the age of three, Stephens was able to identify every make of automobile on the road before he could even read. His parents permanently separated when he was 13 years old, and following graduation from Somerville High School in 1967, Stephens held several jobs including driving a truck, driving a taxi, making pizza, and working in local auto body shops as a <b>body</b> <b>repairman</b> and painter.|$|E

He shared a studio space with friend and fellow painter William Ivey in the rough-hewn Pioneer Square section of downtown Seattle. In 1968 the two briefly opened the Seattle Studio School, giving private lessons to a handful of students. He continued his friendship with painter/collagist Paul Horiuchi, whom he had first met in the mid-1950s when Horiuchi was still working as an auto <b>body</b> <b>repairman</b> ("The first part of Paul I saw were his feet, as he was working under a car," [...] Okada later recalled), and he had long discussions about Zen Buddhism and its relationship to art with Mark Tobey and Tomatsu Takizaki, an antique merchant, poet, and Zen practitioner he'd met through Horiuchi.|$|E
