40|$|Aim: This study {{determined}} whether prior <b>brushing</b> <b>with</b> desensitizing toothpastes (Sensodyne Rapid Relief and Colgate Pro-Relief) {{affected the}} shear bond strengths of composite to dentine surfaces after {{appropriate use of}} two different dentine bonding agents (SingleBond and PQ- 1). Materials and Methods: Sixty caries free molar teeth were cleaned, disinfected and embedded in individual cylinders of polymethylmethracyrlate. The occulsal surfaces were flattened to expose dentine and finished down with 600 grit silicone carbide paper. The teeth were randomly divided into six groups of 10 teeth each. Two groups served as control where dentine surfaces were <b>brushed</b> <b>with</b> pumice slurry. Of the remaining 4 groups, 2 groups were <b>brushed</b> <b>with</b> Sensodyne Rapid Relief and 2 groups <b>brushed</b> <b>with</b> Colgate Pro-Relief. The dentine surfaces were brushed to simulate 2 weeks of twice-daily toothpaste use. The specimens {{in each of the}} control groups an...|$|R

40|$|Background: Dental plaque {{contributes}} to caries and periodontal disease, therefore efficient plaque removal promotes oral health. We hypothesize that individuals <b>brushing</b> <b>with</b> toothpaste containing plaque-indicating dye will demonstrate higher plaque removal efficacy than those using conventional toothpaste. This study tested plaque removal efficacy between a novel FDA-registered toothpaste with plaque-indicating dye and a control toothpaste without indicating dye. Methods: Thirty-one adult participants {{enrolled in the}} study were randomized and divided into two groups. Control group participants <b>brushed</b> <b>with</b> control toothpaste for two visits. Experimental group participants <b>brushed</b> <b>with</b> control toothpaste for their first visit and <b>brushed</b> <b>with</b> experimental toothpaste (PlaqueHDTM, TJA Health LLC, Joliet, Illinois) for their second visit. Participants brushed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Prior to all visits, participants discontinued oral hygiene for 12 - 16 hours. After <b>brushing,</b> participants rinsed <b>with</b> fluorescein solution and intraoral photographs were taken using an ultraviolet digital camera. The presence of plaque on tooth surfaces was visualized by plaque-bound fluorescein and quantified. Images from both visits were compared using custom software to calculate percentage-change of remaining plaque. Statistics (SPSS version 22. 0) were performed to compare plaque reduction between groups. Results: Participants using the experimental toothpaste demonstrated significantly less plaque remaining between visits (51. 3 % reduction, p= 0. 015) than participants using only the placebo toothpaste (8. 3 % reduction, p= 0. 189). Conclusions: Mechanical plaque removal by <b>brushing</b> <b>with</b> toothpaste containing plaque-indicating dye significantly reduced plaque compared to <b>brushing</b> <b>with</b> toothpaste without dye. This innovative dentifrice may improve oral hygiene and reduce plaque-related damages to teeth and oral tissues...|$|R
