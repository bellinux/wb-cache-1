40|$|Cusk (<b>Brosme</b> <b>brosme)</b> was {{designated}} as “threatened” by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) in 2003, {{based on an}} estimated 93 % decline between 1970 and 2001 from the Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Scotian Shelf summer bottom trawl survey index. We combined this index with a fishery-dependent longline index in a Bayesian surplus production state-space model to estimate population trends and the recovery potential of western Scotian Shelf cusk. We tested for index nonproportionality using a power curve function in the observation model and identified potential hyperdepletion for cusk in the trawl survey index. We estimate a 59 % decline in cusk biomass between 1970 and 2001, and a 64 % decline from 1970 to 2007. Although population projections indicate the current landing limit should lead to population recovery, robustness tests suggest the biomass projections and recovery time lines are overly optimistic. Simulations showed that incorporating multiple indices increases power to recapture model parameters and failure to account for index nonproportionality results in biased parameter estimates. We suggest that nonproportionality of fishery-independent indices must be considered when determining the population status of data-poor species. 13 page(s...|$|E

The burbot lineage separated 10 Myr BP from the other Lotinae, while the genetic variation within burbot appeared to be approximately I Myr old. However, fossil evidence suggested that burbot already existed in the Early Pliocene in Europe, from were it probably colonized North America in the Early Pleistocene. While Nearctic burbot survived climatic oscillations and diverged in several refugia, the Eurasian form became extinct or was reduced to a very small population.

40|$|The {{longline}} fisheries for ling (Molva molva) and tusk (<b>Brosme</b> <b>brosme)</b> {{have long}} traditions in Norway. Blue ling (Molva dipterygia) {{was always a}} by-catch in Norwegian slope waters but about 15 years ago this species became {{the target of a}} deep-water gill-net fishery. In recent years 5 - 10 % of the firsthand value of Norwegian landings was attributed to these species. This report provides an overview of the fisheries and population biology of the three species, with emphasis on aspects of relevance to future stock assessments, based on results from Norwegian investigations in 1993 - 95 and literature reviews. The Norwegian fleets which target ling, tusk and blue ling are the high-seas autoline vessels which operate in waters to the west and north of the British Isles, in the North Sea and at the Faroes and Iceland, and longline and gill-net vessels of various sizes fishing in home waters along the Norwegian slope. Exploitation occurs {{in all parts of the}} distribution area of the species. It is still unclear whether separate stocks occur in different sub-areas. Spawning areas are wide-spread, also the distribution of eggs and larvae. Very little is known about migrations. The age and size structure of the catches in various fishing areas show only minor variation. New studies by electrophoresis of tissue enzymes and hemoglobins indicate that tusk from all areas sampled in the northeastern Atlantic belong to the same gene pool, where the results for ling and blue ling are inconclusive. Estimates of mortality show that exploitation rates are high, and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) analyses of ling and tusk based on both private and official logbooks from the longliners indicate a considerable decline in the population sizes since the 1970 s. The catch per unit of effort may have declined by about 70 %. Strategies and requirements for future monitoring by improved CPUE measures and age-based assessement models are discussed.

40|$|Abstract. Previous {{studies have}} {{recorded}} Spironucleus torosus Poynton et Morrison, 1990 from {{several species of}} gadoid fishes, including the only freshwater gadoid, the burbot Lota lota (L.). Two morphologically different isolates of S. torosus have been described (elongate and pyriform). Both {{have been found in}} saltwater, while only the elongate has been found in freshwater. To address the conspecificity of the two morphs of S. torosus, and to identify the source of S. torosus in burbot in Norway, we have sequenced the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene from 43 isolates of S. torosus from six species of gadoid fishes sampled at 15 localities in Norway, Sweden and the Baltic Sea. Phylogenetic analyses of the SSU rRNA gene sequence data recovered two major clades, one containing mainly isolates from burbot, while the other contained isolates from marine gadoid fishes only. The genetic distance (based on 25 nucleotide substitutions in 789 base pairs) separating the two assemblages was not large enough to consider the two groups separate species. Spironucleus torosus isolated from burbot displayed limited genetic variation in the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene along the post-Pleistocene migration route of its host.

Seventeen species of fish and squid were observed with clear habitat and time differences. Observations of feeding behavior, disturbance behavior, and both interspecific and intraspecific interactions provided numerous opportunities for potential sound production; however, sounds were recorded only during a single dive. Although high noise levels generated by the ROV and support ship may have masked some sounds, we conclude that fish sound production in the Gulf of Maine during the fall is uncommon. The recorded fish sounds are tentatively attributed to the cusk <b>Brosme</b> <b>brosme.</b> Cusk sounds consisted variously of isolated thumps, widely spaced thump trains, drumrolls, and their combinations. Frequency peaks were observed at 188, 539, and 1195 Hz. Use of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) as a passive acoustic observation platform was problematic due to high ROV self-noise and the ROV’s inability to maintain a fixed position on the bottom without thruster power. Some fishes were clearly also disturbed by ROV noise, indicating a potential ROV sampling bias. Based on our observations, we suggest that new instruments incorporating both optic and passive acoustic technologies are needed to provide better tools for in situ behavioral studies of cusk and other fishes [Current Zoology 56 (1) : 90 – 99 2010]...|$|E

We characterized the habitat use and behavior of spawning Atlantic cod at two locations off the coast of southwestern Iceland during a 2 -d research cruise (15 – 16 April 2009). We simultaneously operated two different active hydroacoustic gear types, a split beam echosounder and a dual frequency imaging sonar (DIDSON), as well as a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). A total of five fish species were identified through ROV surveys: including cusk <b>Brosme</b> <b>brosme,</b> Atlantic cod, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, lemon sole Microstomus kitt, and Atlantic redfish Sebastes spp. Of the three habitats identified in the acoustic surveys, the transitional habitat between boulder/lava field and sand habitats was characterized by greater fish density and acoustic target strength compared to that of sand or boulder/lava field habitats independently. Atlantic cod were observed behaving {{in a manner consistent with}} published descriptions of spawning. Individuals were observed ascending 1 – 5 m into the water column from the bottom at an average vertical swimming speed of 0. 20 – 0. 25 m s− 1 and maintained an average spacing of 1. 0 – 1. 4 m between individuals.

It is unknown whether this unique cross-linking is associated with the limited or absent specific humoral responses reported for members of this order. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The {{stocks of}} ling Molva molva L., blue ling Molva dipterygia (Pennant, 1784) and tusk <b>Brosme</b> <b>brosme</b> L. {{in the northeastern}} Atlantic support {{significant}} coastal and offshore bank and slope fisheries in several countries. In 1992, Iceland, the Faroes and Norway initiated a three-year project which should provide improved knowledge of the biology of the three species (Bergstad and Hareide 1996; Magnusson et al. 1997). In that project it was focused specifically on age determination methods which could form a basis for future stock assessments and further studies of biology. For all the three species {{there was a need}} for reconsidering the ageing methods applied in earlier studies, and on that basis, perform further technical development and inter-calibration of age readings. This manual summarises results of efforts made for two of the species, ling and tusk, in the period 1993 - 1996. The manual illustrates the agreed practices which should provide reasonably precise age estimates. Data from several inter-calibration exercises carried out during the nordic project were presented by Bergstad et al. (1997). The only structure useful for determining the age of ling and tusk are the sagittal otoliths, and the otoliths are extracted by the same procedures as used for other gadoids (e. g. Williams and Bedford 1974). This manual aims at assisting age readers who are inexperienced with the reading of ling and tusk otoliths. It should be used as an initial guideline and reference only. In order to achieve precise and stable age determination, {{there is a need for}} inter-calibrations of readings by different readers, and repeated reading by the same reader...|$|E
40|$|The present survey {{took place}} {{over a period of}} 12 days in August 1997 along the eastern slope of Rockall Trough between 53 and 58 ºN {{including}} the Northern slope of the Porcupine Bank. Fishing was carried out in six separate areas, in depths between 300 and 2, 925 meters. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain samples of chondricthyan and teleost fish for the Marine Institute (MI) deepwater research programme, for contaminant analysis of fish by the MI chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagasc National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on the Norwegian commercial long-liner "Skarheim," using commercial deep-water autoline gear. In total over 70, 000 hooks were set during the trip and on average 80 % of these were baited. In total 20 species of chondricthyan and 18 species of teleost fish were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were leafscale gulper shark Centrophorus squamosus (36 %), bird beak dogfish Deania calcea (21 %), Portuguese dogfish Centrascyflium coefofepis (13 %), tusk, <b>Brosme</b> <b>brosme</b> (11 %) and mora, Mora mora (6 %). Over the entire survey, discarding was estimated as 30 % of the total catch. The main species discarded were bird beak dogfish and greater lantern shark Etmopterus princeps. Catch per 1, 000 hooks showed that highest abundances were found at 600 - 1, 100 metres throughout the whole fishing area. Three settings were made at depths between 2, 000 and 3, 000 meters. These shots gave valuable information about depth distribution of different species and also brought up species that have never been recorded in the Rockall Trough before...|$|E
40|$|Autonomous {{photographic}} landers are a low-impact {{survey method}} {{for the assessment}} of mobile fauna in situations where methods such as trawling are not feasible or ethical. Three institutions collaborated through the CoralFISH project, each using differing lander systems, to assess the effects of cold-water corals on fish diversity and density. The Biogenic Reef Ichthyofauna Lander (BRIL, Oceanlab), Autonomous Lander for Biological Experiments (ALBEX, NIOZ) and the Marine Environment MOnitoring system (MEMO, CoNISMa) were deployed in four CoralFISH European study regions covering the Arctic, NE Atlantic and Mediterranean, namely Northern Norway (275 - 310 m depth), Belgica Mound Province (686 - 1025 m depth), the Bay of Biscay (623 - 936 m depth), and Santa Maria di Leuca (547 - 670 m depth). A total of 33 deployments were carried out in the different regions. Both the time of first arrival (T arr) and the maximum observed number of fish (MaxN) were standardised between the different lander systems and compared between coral and reference stations as indicators of local fish density. Fish reached significantly higher MaxN at the coral stations than at the reference stations. Fish were also found to have significantly lower T arr in the coral areas in data obtained from the BRIL and MEMO landers. All data indicated that fish abundance is higher within the coral areas. Fish species diversity was higher within the coral areas of Atlantic Ocean while in Northern Norway and Santa Maria di Leuca coral areas, diversity was similar at coral and reference stations but a single dominant species (<b>Brosme</b> <b>brosme</b> and Conger conger respectively) showed much higher density within the coral areas. Indicating that, while cold-water coral reefs {{have a positive effect on}} fish diversity and/or abundance, this effect varies across Europe's reefs...|$|E
40|$|The report {{presents}} {{results from}} the Water Column Monitoring survey 2011, performed in collaboration by NIVA and IRIS. The objective of the survey {{was to assess the}} extent to which produced water (PW) discharged from Gullfaks C platform affects organisms living in the water column. The study was designed to monitor bioaccumulation and biomarker responses in mussels held in cages {{in the vicinity of the}} water discharge point, with supporting information from passive sampling devices. Significantly greater bioaccumulation of PAH and NPD compounds was found in mussels from the two stations positioned 500 m from the platform, with concentrations significantly higher in mussels from one of the 500 m stations (i. e. station 2). All other mussel stations positioned 1000 m and 2000 m from the platform had PAH-NPD bioaccumulation typical of offshore background concentrations. There was very good agreement between the biomarker responses and the chemical concentration data. The calculated integrated biological response (IBR/n) was markedly higher in mussels from station 2, indicating poorer health. The IBR/n was also slightly raised in mussels from station 3 (1000 m), which was considered to be due to other chemicals within the PW. Alkyl phenols and naphthenic acids were detected in all POCIS placed at selected mussel stations from 500 to 2000 m, with mussel station 2 (500 m) and 3 (1000 m) showing highest concentrations of these compounds. PAH metabolites were detected in wild caught whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and tusk (<b>Brosme</b> <b>brosme).</b> The measured PAH metabolites in both fish species were indicative of weathered PW chemicals. Overall chemical bioaccumulation and impaired health to caged mussels was observed in mussels exposed to the PW plume located 500 m downstream from the platform.

Fresh samples were collected, usually from alive fish. They were minced and stored at below - 15 ° C during the investigation. Niacin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid and vitamin B 12 were determined {{in the different}} organs by microbiological assays. Chemical analyses of the protein-, fat-, ash- and water contents were also carried out, mainly on the edible parts as meat, liver and hard roe, thus giving data for a more complete nutritional evaluation of food-stuffs. The results are summarized in Table 1 - 8, which have English subtitles. In general meat from gadus-fishes is a fairly good source, liver is a good source and hard roe a very good source of the vitamins investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{species cod}} (Gadus morrhua), {{coalfish}} (Gadus virens), ling (Molva molva) and torsk (Brosmus <b>brosme)</b> have been investigated. The {{samples were collected}} from newly caught fish and analysed fresh or after storage at below - 15 °C. Vitamin B 6 was determined microbiologically using Saccharomyces carlsbergensis as testorganism. Biotin was determined microbiologically with Lactobacillus plantarum. The results are summarized in Table 1 - 5, which have English subtitles. In general the filets were good sources for vitamin B 6 and biotin. The white and red muscle contained about equal concentrations of vitamin B 6, wheras the red muscle contained 6 to 22 times as much biotin as the white muscle. The liver is a fair source for vitamin B 6 but a very rich source for biotin. The kidneys showed {{a difference between the}} front parts and the back parts, with about four times higher concentrations of both vitamin B 6 and biotin in the latter.

40|$|The {{biological}} {{effects of}} an offshore oil platform on local fish populations were assessed {{as part of the}} Water Column Monitoring (WCM) programme for 2014. The Njord A platform was chosen as the study location, which was not in operation and had no current discharge of produced water. Demersal fish species were targeted since they were believed to be less likely to migrate away from the platform than pelagic fish. By targeting organisms deeper in the water column and selecting a platform currently not in operation, the impact of drill cuttings and other sediment sources including leakages from well deposits were the main sources of contamination. Wild fish including ling (Molva molva), tusk (<b>Brosme</b> <b>brosme),</b> redfish (Sebastes sp.) and saithe (Pollachius virens) were caught with baited rod and line from within the 500 m safety zone of the Njord A platform during the summer of 2014. Reference fish were caught on a separate research cruise by trawling from a region of the Norwegian Sea less impacted by oil and gas activities. Limited numbers of reference ling were obtained and the reference data for ling collected from the North Sea as part of the WCM 2013 programme were used for comparison of the biomarker responses. Contaminant body burden and a suite of biological effects endpoints were measured in all fish groups and included DNA adducts, DNA strand breaks by comet assay, acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibition, ethoxyresorufin 0 -deethylase (EROD), vitellogenin (VTG), lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), liver and gill histopathology, PAH metabolites, and PAH body burden. The biomarker data were integrated using the integrated biological response index (IBR/n). Despite low and/or undetected concentrations of PAH and PAH metabolites in fish fillet and bile respectively significant responses in AChE, comet and DNA adducts were found. The biomarker responses indicated exposure to both neurotoxic and genotoxic chemicals in fish inhabiting the lower water column with influence from sediment sources around the Njord A platform. Integration of the biomarker responses (IBR/n) found that all four fish species that were caught from around the platform had markedly higher IBR/n values than their respective reference population. The study shows the advantage of using a suite of biomarkers for assessing the biological effects of low concentrations of complex mixtures with biological effects observed despite low concentrations of PAH measured.
