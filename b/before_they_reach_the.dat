5|$|The {{primary cause}} of {{vibrations}} in a properly functioning bicycle is the surface over which it rolls. In addition to pneumatic tires and traditional bicycle suspensions, {{a variety of techniques}} have been developed to damp vibrations <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> rider. These include materials, such as carbon fiber, either in the whole frame or just key components such as the front fork, seatpost, or handlebars; tube shapes, such as curved seat stays; and special inserts, such as Zertz by Specialized, and Buzzkills by Bontrager.|$|E
5|$|Adopted {{from the}} Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption has a {{modified}} wanted system. When the player commits a crime such as killing people near witnesses, some will {{run to the}} nearest police station. The player can bribe them or kill them <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> station. If a crime is committed near a police officer, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. If Marston's bounty becomes high enough he will be pursued by either the U.S. Marshals or by the Mexican Army depending on his locations. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, John Marston must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player character can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear. Despite the chase being aborted, a bounty is placed upon John which will cause bounty hunters to come after him in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away Marston's weapon and standing still as they will kill him regardless. Only law enforcement in towns and a posse will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase Marston unless he pays his bounty at a telegraph station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, Marston pays off his bounty and is then released. If the player {{does not have enough}} money to pay back the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities.|$|E

25|$|Newly formed {{stars are}} known as pre-main-sequence stars during the stage of stellar {{evolution}} <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> main-sequence. Stars in this stage (ages <10 million years) produce X-rays in their stellar coronae. However, their X-ray emission is 103 to 105 times stronger than for main-sequence stars of similar masses.|$|E
25|$|To cut costs, {{customers}} unload bulkier products directly off a pallet. Some items, like produce, {{are priced}} per item instead of by weight. For {{items that are}} still sold by weight, the customers weigh, barcode, and tag those items <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> check-out counter. Unlike the regular stores, the 365 stores offer a rewards program.|$|E

25|$|Riparian forest buffers are diverse {{communities}} of trees, shrubs and native perennial grasses. They {{are great for}} providing habitat for wildlife on land and in the water. Taller trees next to the streams help to lower water temperatures with shade which improves aquatic communities. The shrubs and grasses help to slow flooding and the larger trees can sometimes intercept nitrates <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> water with their deep roots.|$|E
25|$|In the 1800s the Baylands marshes ended between Alma and El Camino Real in Palo Alto, which {{explains}} why historical maps show area creeks appearing to terminate <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> Bay. Duck-hunting blinds were common {{in the nineteenth century}} along what is now Middlefield Road. The 1862 Allardt map shows Adobe Creek, then Yeguas Creek, having dual termini – one in the Baylands Marsh and the other to San Francisquito Creek just before entering San Francisco Bay.|$|E
25|$|Atoms in {{the first}} excited state may also be re-ionized by the ambient CMB photons <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> ground state. When this is the case, {{it is as if}} the {{recombination}} to the excited state did not happen {{in the first}} place. To account for this possibility, Peebles defines the factor C as the probability that an atom in the first excited state reaches the ground state through either of the two pathways described above before being photoionized.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} common forms in which AAS are administered: oral pills; {{injectable}} steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Oral administration {{is the most}} convenient. Testosterone administered by mouth is rapidly absorbed, but it is largely converted to inactive metabolites, and only about one-sixth is available in active form. In order to be sufficiently active when given by mouth, testosterone derivatives are alkylated at the 17α position, e.g. methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone. This modification reduces the liver's ability to break down these compounds <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> systemic circulation.|$|E
25|$|David G. Meirhofer (June 8, 1949 – September 29, 1974) was an American {{serial killer}} who {{committed}} four murders in rural Montana between 1967 and 1974 — {{three of them}} children. At the time, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was developing a new method of tracking killers called offender profiling, and Meirhofer was the first serial killer to be investigated using the technique. Offender profiling is a method used to learn clues about the characteristics of an unknown killer from evidence {{at the scene of}} the crime and establish their behavioural patterns <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> height of their criminality.|$|E
25|$|Most nuclear {{stations}} require {{two distinct}} sources of offsite {{power feeding station}} service transformers that are sufficiently separated in the station's switchyard and can receive power from multiple transmission lines. In addition in some nuclear stations the turbine generator can power the station's house loads while the station is online via station service transformers which tap power from the generator output bus bars <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> step-up transformer (these stations also have station service transformers that receive offsite power directly from the switch yard). Even with the redundancy of two power sources total loss of offsite power is still possible. Nuclear power stations are equipped with emergency power.|$|E

25|$|The {{danger of}} ragwort {{is that the}} toxin can have a {{cumulative}} effect. The alkaloid does not actually accumulate in the liver but a breakdown product can damage DNA and progressively kills cells. About 3-7% of the body weight is sometimes claimed as deadly for horses, but an example in the scientific literature exists of a horse surviving being fed over 20% of its body weight. The effect of low doses is lessened by {{the destruction of the}} original alkaloids by the action of bacteria in the digestive tract <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> bloodstream. There is no known antidote or cure to poisoning, but examples are known from the scientific literature of horses making a full recovery once consumption has been stopped.|$|E
25|$|Polymeric IgA (mainly the {{secretory}} dimer) {{is produced}} by plasma cells in the lamina propria adjacent to mucosal surfaces. It binds to the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells, and is taken up into the cell via endocytosis. The receptor-IgA complex passes through the cellular compartments before being secreted on the luminal surface of the epithelial cells, still attached to the receptor. Proteolysis of the receptor occurs, and the dimeric IgA molecule, along with {{a portion of the}} receptor known as the secretory component, are free to diffuse throughout the lumen. In the gut, IgA can bind to the mucus layer covering the epithelial cells. In this way, a barrier capable of neutralizing threats <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> epithelial cells is formed.|$|E
25|$|Measures {{other than}} {{drainage}} {{have been implemented}} to contain flooding in the city. In 1950, dikes were built to confine storm runoff. Rivers that run through the city were encapsulated in 1950 and 1951. Rivers such as the Consulado River, Churubusco River and the Remedio River are encased in concrete tunnels which take their waters directly to the drainage system to leave the Valley. Two other rivers, the San Javier and the Tlalnepantla, which used to feed the old lake system, are diverted <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> city and their waters now flow directly into the Grand Canal. None of water from these rivers is allowed to sink into the ground to recharge the aquifer. While the rivers and streams that flow down from the mountain peaks still begin the way they always have, their passage through the shantytowns lacking city sanitation schemes that surround Mexico City turns them into open combined sewers. Therefore, their final stages are frequently culverted or added to the existing major culverted rivers to keep this water from contaminating the aquifer.|$|E

500|$|Low-mass helium white dwarfs (with a mass < 0.20 , often {{referred}} to as [...] "extremely low-mass white dwarfs, ELM WDs") are formed in binary systems. As a result of their hydrogen-rich envelopes, residual hydrogen burning via the CNO cycle may keep these white dwarfs hot on a long timescale. In addition, they remain in a bloated proto-white dwarf stage for up to 2 Gyr <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> cooling track.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, much of Minehead's {{beach was}} washed {{away in a}} severe storm which also caused serious {{flooding}} in the town. A £12.6 million sea defence scheme by the Environment Agency was designed {{to reduce the risk}} of this erosion and flooding happening in the future. The Environment Agency built [...] of new sea wall and rock or concrete stepped revetments between 1997 and 1998 and imported 320,000tons of additional sand in 1999 to build a new beach. This beach sits between four rock groynes and has been built at a much higher level than the previous beach so that the waves are broken <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> new sea wall. Any waves that do reach the new wall are turned back by its curved shape. The town's new sea defences were officially opened in 2001.|$|E
500|$|Oroville Dam {{completely}} {{blocks the}} anadromous migrations of Chinook salmon and steelhead trout in the Feather River. In 1967, {{in an effort}} to compensate for lost habitat, [...] the DWR and the California Department of Fish and Game completed the Feather River Fish Hatchery. The Fish Barrier Dam, built in 1962, intercepts salmon and trout <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> base of the impassable Thermalito Diversion Dam and forces them to swim up a fish ladder to the hatchery, which is located on the north bank of the Feather River. The hatchery produces 10 million salmon smolt, along with 450,000 trout smolt, to stock in the river each year. The salmon smolt are released in two runs, with 20% for the spring run and 80% for the fall run. This facility has been successful enough that there is concern that salmon of hatchery stock are out-competing remaining wild salmon in the Feather River system.|$|E
