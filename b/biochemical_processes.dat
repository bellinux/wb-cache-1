Chadwick was automatically a committee member of both faculties, and in 1938 {{he was appointed}} to a commission headed by Lord Derby to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in Liverpool.

5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA or RNA which codes for a molecule that has a function. The DNA is first copied into RNA. The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring {{is the basis of}} the inheritance of phenotypic traits. These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes. Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene–environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye color or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic <b>biochemical</b> <b>processes</b> that comprise life.|$|E
5|$|Many catabolic <b>biochemical</b> <b>processes,</b> such as glycolysis, the {{citric acid}} cycle, and beta oxidation, produce the reduced {{coenzyme}} NADH. This coenzyme contains electrons {{that have a}} high transfer potential; in other words, they will release {{a large amount of}} energy upon oxidation. However, the cell does not release this energy all at once, as this would be an uncontrollable reaction. Instead, the electrons are removed from NADH and passed to oxygen through a series of enzymes that each release a small amount of the energy. This set of enzymes, consisting of complexes I through IV, is called the electron transport chain and is found in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Succinate is also oxidized by the electron transport chain, but feeds into the pathway at a different point.|$|E

Arsenic is a moderately abundant element in Earth's crust, and although many arsenic compounds are often considered highly toxic to most life, {{a wide variety}} of organoarsenic compounds are produced biologically and various organic and inorganic arsenic compounds are metabolized by numerous organisms. This pattern is general for other related elements, including selenium, which can exhibit both beneficial and deleterious effects. Arsenic biochemistry has become topical since many toxic arsenic compounds are found in some aquifers, potentially affecting many millions of people via <b>biochemical</b> <b>processes.</b>|$|E

Oxidative phosphorylation is the energy-generating <b>biochemical</b> <b>process</b> whereby pyruvate, produced by glycolysis, is oxidized to CO 2 and H 2 O {{with the production}} of 30 moles of ATP.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present an exergy {{analysis}} of bioethanol production process from lignocellulosic feedstock via a <b>biochemical</b> <b>process</b> to asses the overall thermodynamic efficiency and identify the main loss processes. The thermodynamic efficiency of the <b>biochemical</b> <b>process</b> was found to be 35 % and the major inefficiencies of this process were identified as: the combustion of lignin for process heat and power production and the simultaneous scarification and co-fermentation process accounting for 67 % and 27 % of the lost exergy, respectively. These results were also compared with a previous analysis of a thermochemical process for producing biofuel. Despite fundamental differences, the <b>biochemical</b> and thermochemical <b>processes</b> considered here had similar levels of thermodynamic efficiency. Process heat and power production was the major contributor to exergy loss in both of the processes.

Therefore, an ocean with photosynthetic life will have a lower 13C/12C ratio within organic remains, and a higher ratio in corresponding ocean water.
