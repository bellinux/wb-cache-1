5|$|Uncertainty {{comes in}} four categories: {{conceptual}} uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. Conceptual uncertainty arises when {{the language is}} unclear, {{which leads to the}} trust being declared invalid. Evidential uncertainty is where a question of fact, such as whether a claimant is a <b>beneficiary,</b> cannot be answered; this does not always lead to invalidity. Ascertainability is where a <b>beneficiary</b> cannot be found, and administrative unworkability arises when the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various ways of resolving uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty, and giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a <b>beneficiary.</b>|$|E

5|$|The courts {{recognise}} {{two forms}} of secret trust. Fully secret trusts are trusts not referred to {{at all on the}} face of the will. Instead, an agreement made between the testator and trustees elsewhere.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To assess which Consumer Assessment of Health Plans (CAHPS) survey {{measures}} Medicare <b>beneficiaries</b> {{find the}} most meaningful, how <b>beneficiaries</b> and information intermediaries interpret different formats for presenting CAHPS information, and how <b>beneficiaries</b> have reacted to the CAHPS information included in the annual mailing to <b>beneficiaries</b> called Medicare & You 2000. DATA SOURCES: Fourteen focus groups of <b>beneficiaries</b> and State Health Insurance Assistance Program counselors, more than 200 cognitive interviews, and 122 mall-intercept interviews with <b>beneficiaries</b> were conducted from spring 1998 through winter 2000. STUDY DESIGN: In 1998 focus groups and cognitive {{interviews were conducted with}} Medicare <b>beneficiaries</b> and State Health Insurance Assistance Program counselors to determine which CAHPS measures to report to Medicare <b>beneficiaries</b> and how to report this information. In 1999 additional focus groups and mall-intercept interviews were conducted to determine which measures to include in Medicare & You 2000. To obtain feedback on the CAHPS information in Medicare & You 2000 additional focus groups were conducted in winter 2000. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Focus group participants indicated that getting the care they need quickly, having access to specialists, and communicating well with doctors were more important to them than nonmedical characteristics of plans. Most <b>beneficiaries</b> had problems interpreting quality information. Many misinterpreted star charts, and while bar charts appear easier to read, many <b>beneficiaries</b> still had trouble interpreting the information on these charts. Most <b>beneficiaries</b> did not consider quality information important to them and most were unaware of the availability of CAHPS information. CONCLUSIONS: Many challenges lie ahead in making quality information meaningful to Medicare <b>beneficiaries.</b> These challenges include increasing awareness of the existence of this information, educating <b>beneficiaries</b> about how this information can help in choosing a health plan, continuing to simplify reporting formats, assuring <b>beneficiaries</b> that this information comes from a credible source, and providing guidance to <b>beneficiaries</b> about how quality information can help with health care decisions...|$|R

5|$|If {{a secret}} trust cannot be established, the <b>beneficiary</b> will hold outright. If a secret trust can be shown, but not its terms (or {{communication}} post-dated the testator's death), then the would-be trustee will hold on resulting trust for the testator's estate.|$|E
5|$|Simply disclaiming a {{beneficial}} interest does not fall within Section 53(1)(c), as in Re Paradise Motor Co. Nominating somebody {{to receive benefits}} of a pension fund should the pensioner die is also not a valid disposition, as in Re Danish Bacon Co Ltd Staff Pension Fund, and neither is nominating a <b>beneficiary</b> under a life insurance policy, as in Gold v Hill. Where a <b>beneficiary</b> declares he is holding the property on behalf of another, {{this would be the}} creation of a sub-trust and not subject to specific formalities. However, under Grainge v Wilberforce, such a sub-trust will only be held to be valid if there is some difference between the trust and sub-trust, and if the trustee-beneficiary has some duties to perform.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a pit road, the race was split into three {{segments}} of 60, 50 and 40 laps so teams can make pit stops and adjustments between each segment, {{and there would be no}} positions gained nor lost during stops. In segment 1, Timothy Peters took the lead from pole-sitter Ken Schrader on lap 15, and led for 23 laps until Kyle Larson took the lead on lap 39, who led for the remainder of the segment. In the final five laps of the segment, the first caution of the race flew for debris, and the <b>beneficiary</b> was Max Gresham, who was the first driver at least a lap down, which allowed him to regain a lap. In the second segment, Larson continued to lead for a total of 50 laps until Austin Dillon passed him on lap 89 after the former collided with Germán Quiroga. One lap later, another caution was flown for debris, and Gresham was again the <b>beneficiary.</b> On lap 116, Jared Landers' truck became loose in turn 2, collected Ty Dillon and made contact with Johnny Sauter. Quiroga was the <b>beneficiary</b> on the resulting caution. Larson and Austin Dillon dueled for the remainder of the race, with Dillon allowing Larson to pass on lap 122, but Dillon managed to get past Larson on the following lap. Two more cautions for debris (first on the front stretch, the second in turn 4) were eventually flown, and a green–white–checker finish was initiated due to debris in turn 4 on lap 149. Dillon retained the lead on the GWC to win, beating Larson by 1.197 seconds. Behind Dillon and Larson, Ryan Newman finished third, followed by Joey Coulter, Brendan Gaughan, Timothy Peters, Darrell Wallace Jr., Matt Crafton, Dave Blaney and Max Gresham. Sauter (accident) and Jeff Babcock (engine) failed to finish the race.|$|E

5|$|In English law, secret trusts are a {{class of}} trust defined as an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee, made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a formal will. The property {{is given to the}} trustee in the will, and he would then be expected to pass it on to the real <b>beneficiary.</b> For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the trust must prove that the testator intended to form a trust, that this intention was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his office. There are two types of secret trust — fully secret and half-secret. A fully secret trust is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. In the case of a half-secret trust, the face of the will names the trustee as trustee, but does not give the trust's terms, including the <b>beneficiary.</b> The most important difference lies in communication of the trust: the terms of a half-secret trust must be communicated to the trustee before the execution of the will, whereas {{in the case of a}} fully secret trust the terms may be communicated after the execution of the will, as long as this is before the testator's death.|$|E

Tax reforms in the 1850s had enabled the publication of inexpensive newspapers with wider circulation. These mushroomed in the later Victorian era to include mass-circulation newspapers as cheap as a halfpenny, along with popular magazines such as The Illustrated Police News which made the Ripper the <b>beneficiary</b> of previously unparalleled publicity.|$|E

5|$|The new {{block grant}} program {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} former Food Stamp program in three major ways. First, the new NAP program was designed to distribute the benefits through physical cheques, ensuring that the benefit would be payable only to the <b>beneficiary</b> {{while at the same}} time reducing administrative costs, since the former physical vouchers (cupones in Spanish) were subject to storage and accountability problems, theft, counterfeiting and even trafficking. Second, the benefits were no longer restricted to vouchers redeemable only for food, but were provided in cash. The <b>beneficiary</b> could then elect to purchase a product or select services other than food. Third, the overall assistance provided to Puerto Rico was limited to an annual block appropriation, requiring the Puerto Rican government to adjust its program management to allocate the funds. Between 1982 and 1986, the U.S. Congress awarded $825 million annually in block grants for NAP program, and since then the appropriations have steadily increased by an estimated 3% to 4% to compensate for inflation. It has surpassed $1 billion annually since the early 1990s, and increased 30% from 1993 to 2002. Since fiscal year 2006, the appropriation has reached over $1.5 billion annually.|$|E
