25|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{is that it}} {{is difficult}} to split sets of carriages. While power cars can be removed from trains by standard uncoupling procedures, specialised depot equipment is needed to split carriages, by lifting the entire train at once. Once uncoupled, one of the carriage ends is left without a bogie at the split, so a <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> is required to support it.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{the basic}} TRAXX design was {{subjected}} to a major overhaul, with the carbody and the front redesigned to suit current crashworthiness standards, and the replacement of GTO thyristor based inverters with IGBT based inverters. The option of individual axle control in place of individual bogie control was also introduced. The coolant of the inverters and the main transformer was also changed from ester to water. The carbody design was completely standardised, by default providing a space for the mounting of a flip-disc display above the windshield, which is covered by a non-structural hood in freight versions. The <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> was strengthened, to allow an increase of axle loads to 22 tons. This generation of the family is {{also referred to as}} the TRAXX2 platform, and is sometimes also indicated with a number 2 {{at the end of the}} type designations.|$|E

This is then converted to direct current before being converted to three-phase electricity through one of three gate turn-off thyristors. Each bogie has three rectifiers, each connected to a transformer that is again connected to two inverters. The motors are three-phase asynchronous motors located in the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> and equipped with regenerative brakes. There is also an auxiliary three-phase power supply which powers the compressor, pumps, ventilators and other auxiliary equipment, operated by four separate inverters. The controller is a 16-bit microprocessor that communicates using optical fibre cables.

Traction links were connected to the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> at a height of 200 mm above rail. The locomotive superstructure is supported on coil springs on a central swing bolster, and the centre bogie allows 200 mm of lateral movement to negotiate small-radius curves.

5000|$|The sandboxes, {{which were}} {{mounted on the}} <b>bogie</b> <b>frames,</b> were {{ineffective}} and required much too complicated gearing {{due to the fact}} that the engine units pivoted.

50|$|The {{bodies are}} {{supported}} by two twin-axle <b>bogies.</b> The <b>bogie</b> <b>frames</b> are of a H-shaped fully welded construction. Trainsets constructed up to ER9p-125 have N. E. Galakhov's elliptical amortizers in their central suspensions. <b>Bogie</b> <b>frames</b> {{are supported by}} 8 cylindrical springs installed in a coat of axle box balancers. The static deformation of amortizer is 105 mm. Starting with ER9p-126 trainset (1966), the trolleys are supported on axles box through four sets of cylindrical springs, placed in two rows. The hydraulic amortizers are placed in the central suspension, like the ER2 motor cars dating from 1966-1975. The static deformation remained the same (105 mm). The diameter of motor car wheels is 1050 mm, and of trailer car wheels is 950 mm.|$|R
50|$|The {{running gear}} {{of a modern}} railway vehicle comprises, in most instances, a <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> with two wheelsets. However there are also wagons with single axles (fixed or movable) and even {{individual}} wheels.|$|E

50|$|The M62 {{locomotive}} has a Co-Co wheel arrangement, {{running on}} two bogies with three axles on each bogie. Chassis and <b>bogie</b> <b>frames</b> are constructed out of box elements. The two-stroke diesel engine {{and the main}} alternator are mounted on a steel frame. The frame is fixed to the chassis with elastic supports. Electric traction motors are mounted on <b>bogie</b> <b>frames</b> with a tram system. M62 is equipped with electro-pneumatic multiple-unit controls; therefore {{it is possible to}} drive two locomotives from one cab. The locomotive had enough power to pull a 1,000 t freight train with a top speed of 80 km/h (on level track), while two coupled locomotives are able to pull trains up to 3,600 t. The top speed in such a case was 60 - 100 km/h.|$|R
25|$|The power cars {{received}} new <b>bogie</b> <b>frames</b> and a {{new power}} supply for the air conditioning. The power cars of trainsets 01 to 20 were refitted with GTO power converters. Smaller measures included diagnosis and subsequent repair of the driver's brake valve, the installation of new relays into some safety circuits and some software changes.|$|R
50|$|The bolster springs are {{supported}} on a lower spring beam. The lower spring beam is a fabricated structure {{made of steel}} plates. It is trapezoidal in shape with small steel tubes on each end. The location of the bolster spring seating is marked by two circular grooves in the center. A rubber washer is placed at the grooved section. The bolster spring sits on the rubber washer. The lower spring beam is also a free-floating structure. It is not bolted or welded either to the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> or the bogie bolster. It {{is attached to the}} <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> on the outside {{with the help of a}} steel hanger. They are traditionally called the BSS Hangers (Bogie Secondary Suspension Hangers). A BSS pin is placed in the tubular section in the end portion of the lower spring beam. A hanger block is placed below the BSS pin. The BSS hanger in turn supports the hanger. This arrangement is done on all the four corners of the lower spring beam. The top end of the hanger also has a similar arrangement. However, instead of the BSS pin, steel brackets are welded on the lower side of the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> of which the BSS hanger hangs with the help of hanger block. This arrangement is same for all the four top corners of the hangers. Hence, the lower spring beam also become a floating member hinged to the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> with the help of hangers on the top and the bottom. This allows for the longitudinal movement of the lower spring beam.|$|E

50|$|The <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> has {{a single}} central cross member which {{supports}} via pivots two longitudinal beams (in a 'weighing scale' arrangement) connected to the wheelset via the primary suspension.
