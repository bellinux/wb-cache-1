5|$|After {{winning the}} coin toss and {{receiving}} the ball, the Giants offense stalled {{and was forced}} to punt. From their own 20, the Colts drove the <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New York 1-yard line, where Alan Ameche ran for a touchdown to give the Colts the championship, 23–17.|$|E
5|$|Following a Chicago punt, Indianapolis drove 47yards {{and scored}} with Vinatieri's 29-yard field goal {{to make the}} score 14–9. Chicago was forced to punt again on their next drive, and return man Terrence Wilkins {{returned}} the ball 12yards to his own 42-yard line. Manning started out the drive with a 22-yard completion to Marvin Harrison. His next pass went to tight end Dallas Clark for 17yards. Two more completions moved the <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bears' 11-yard line, and then Dominic Rhodes took the <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end zone with three consecutive carries, the last one a 1-yard touchdown run to give his team a 16–14 lead with 6:09 left in the second quarter.|$|E
5|$|Following a halftime musical {{performance}} by The Doobie Brothers, {{the second half}} began. Because Cincinnati received <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> begin <b>the</b> game, Virginia Tech received <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> begin <b>the</b> second half.|$|R

5|$|Alabama {{started from}} their own four, and Lacy had a short gain before Richardson had four {{consecutive}} runs to move the <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 39-yard line. The next play was Alabama's longest play from scrimmage in the game when McCarron threw a 39-yard pass to Richardson and brought the <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> LSU 19-yard line. However, {{for the fourth time}} in four offensive possessions, the LSU defense held Alabama to a field goal attempt. This time, the 34-yard Jeremy Shelley kick was good and the Crimson Tide took a 3–0 lead. Once the received the kickoff, LSU began their fourth offensive possession {{from their own}} 24. The Tigers opened their drive with runs of 14 and nine yards from Ford, followed by short runs from Ware, Jefferson and Ford again to bring the <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Alabama 36. After a five yard substitution penalty, Jefferson completed a 34-yard pass to Russell Shepard to give the Tigers a first and goal from the Alabama eight. After a four-yard rush by Ford and a Jefferson incompletion, Dre Kirkpatrick was called for holding that resulted in a first and goal from the Alabama two-yard line. Jefferson then threw another incompletion followed with a run for no gain by Ford. LSU then called a time-out with two seconds left in the half to set up a field goal attempt, and Alabama followed with a second time-out in an attempt to ice the kicker. Drew Alleman then kicked a 19-yard field goal as time expired to tie the game at 3–3 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|At 4/189 Loxton {{came in to}} join Harvey, who {{continued}} to attack the bowling, unperturbed by Miller's demise. Ken Cranston came on to bowl and Harvey square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for consecutive boundaries. Yardley then moved a man from fine leg to where the hook had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fielder's former position, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 4/204, with Harvey on 70.|$|E
5|$|Baseball America rated Humber as the 50th-best {{prospect}} {{in baseball}} {{heading into the}} 2005 season. Humber entered spring training in 2005 with the Mets. There, he clashed with Mets' pitching coach Rick Peterson, who wanted Humber to adopt a different training regimen and change the manner with which he threw the <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plate. The Mets front office supported Humber, telling him to pitch how he felt comfortable.|$|E

As in {{the first}} half, however, both teams' offenses were stifled by each team's defense. On its first possession of the second half, Wake Forest reached the Georgia Tech 48-yard line before being forced to punt.|$|R
5|$|Morris found batting {{difficult}} {{for the first few}} weeks of the tour, as he struggled to adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly, he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.|$|E
5|$|On State's {{first play}} after the turnover, Rix was sacked for a four-yard loss. On the next play, Virginia Tech defender Eric Green jumped {{in front of}} an errant Rix pass and intercepted it.

On the first play of the drive, Tech attempted a reverse pass, but the ball fell incomplete. Two subsequent plays were stopped for no gain, and Tech punted {{for the first time in}} the game.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} Tide {{play of the}} drive, Alabama was penalized 15 yards for {{holding on to the}} {{facemask}} of a Virginia Tech player. A running play by Alexander was stopped after a loss of a yard, then Zow threw an interception directly to Virginia Tech's Phillip Summers, who returned the <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> two-yard line. After the interception, it took Tech two plays for Pegues to push the football across the goal line for Tech's second touchdown of the game. The extra point was good, and Tech extended its lead to 177 with 8:15 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
50|$|As the {{designated}} visiting team, Hamilton called {{heads for the}} coin toss. With the toss turning up tails, Saskatchewan deferred their choice <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second half.

5|$|The coin toss {{featured}} former Virginia Tech star Bruce Smith, while Kansas {{was represented}} by Gale Sayers. Kansas won the toss and elected to defer its choice until the second half. Virginia Tech chose <b>to</b> receive <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> start <b>the</b> game. Kansas would receive <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> begin <b>the</b> second half. At kickoff, the air temperature was unseasonably cold for Miami at , and the skies were cloudy with intermittent rain.|$|R
50|$|Cut {{multiplex}} throws involve throwing both <b>balls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same {{or other}} {{hand like a}} stacked multiplex but in a staggered fashion so the bottom ball of the duplex is caught, and re-thrown before the top ball is caught.

5|$|On {{the first}} play after the turnover, Thomas Jones's 52-yard run moved the <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Colts' 5-yard line. Three plays later, Rex Grossman threw a 4-yard {{touchdown}} pass to receiver Muhsin Muhammad, giving the Bears a 14–6 lead. After forcing an Indianapolis punt, Chicago lost another turnover when Cedric Benson's fumble was recovered by Colts defensive end Dwight Freeney on the Bears' 43-yard line. Indianapolis subsequently advanced to the 36-yard line, but decided to punt rather than risk a 53-yard field-goal attempt.|$|E
5|$|On the game's next play, Chapman {{passed the}} ball deep, {{toward the end}} zone. Though the pass fell incomplete, a game {{official}} called a 15-yard pass interference penalty against NC State. This moved the <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NC State 23-yard line and forced Tech kicker Chris Kinzer to attempt a potentially game-winning 40-yard field goal with four seconds remaining. Though NC State coach Dick Sheridan called a timeout {{in an attempt to}} ice Chris Kinzer, the kick sailed through the uprights and Virginia Tech won a 2524 victory as time expired.|$|E

5|$|The Clemson Tigers {{began the}} game with first possession. After Georgia Tech's kickoff and a short return, the Tigers' offense began work at their 33-yard line. Three short plays {{advanced}} the <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Clemson 41-yard line and gained the Tigers a first down. On the next play, Clemson running back C. J. Spiller broke free for a 40-yard rush to the Georgia Tech 19-yard line. Two plays later, Clemson quarterback Kyle Parker completed a 15-yard pass to Jacoby Ford. On the next play, Spiller ran forward three yards, across the goal line for a touchdown and the game's first points.|$|E
