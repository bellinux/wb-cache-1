In {{this study we}} investigated the ability of chemical cross-linkers to facilitate <b>bonding</b> <b>of</b> {{articular cartilage}}, either alone or in combination with a pre-treatment with surface-degrading agents. Articular cartilage blocks were harvested from the femoropatellar groove of bovine calves. Two cartilage blocks, either after pre-treatment or without, were assembled in a custom-designed chamber in partial apposition and subjected to cross-linking treatment. Subsequently, <b>bonding</b> <b>of</b> cartilage was measured as adhesive strength, that is, the maximum force at rupture <b>of</b> <b>bonded</b> cartilage <b>blocks</b> divided by the overlap area. In a first approach, bonding was investigated after treatment with cross-linking reagents only, employing glutaraldehyde, 1 -ethyl- 3 -diaminopropyl-carbodiimide (EDC) /N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), genipin, or transglutaminase. Experiments were conducted with or without compression of the opposing surfaces. Compression during cross-linking strongly enhanced bonding, especially when applying EDC/NHS and glutaraldehyde. Therefore, all further experiments were performed under compressive conditions. Combinations {{of each of the}} four cross-linking agents with the degrading pre-treatments, pepsin, trypsin, and guanidine, led to distinct improvements in bonding compared to the use of cross-linkers alone. The highest values of adhesive strength were achieved employing combinations of pepsin or guanidine with EDC/NHS, and guanidine with glutaraldehyde. The release of extracellular matrix components, that is, glycosaminoglycans and total collagen, from cartilage blocks after pre-treatment was measured, but could not be directly correlated to the determined adhesive strength. Cytotoxicity was determined for all substances employed, that is, surface degrading agents and cross-linkers, using the resazurin assay. Taking the favourable cell vitality after treatment with pepsin and EDC/NHS and the cytotoxic effects of guanidine and glutaraldehyde into account, the combination of pepsin and EDC/NHS appeared to be the most advantageous treatment in this study. In conclusion, <b>bonding</b> <b>of</b> articular cartilage <b>blocks</b> was achieved by chemical fixation of their surface components using cross-linking reagents. Application of compressive forces and prior modulation of surface structures enhanced cartilage bonding significantly. Enzymatic treatment in combination with cross-linkers may represent a promising addition to current techniques for articular cartilage repair...|$|R

In this work a system consisting <b>of</b> the <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> Si 3 N 4, which had been coated with a preceramic film containing a fine dispersion of silicon and a thin layer of germanium powder, were investigated to determine the effect of the thickness of the germanium film. The maximum service temperature is not determined by the melting point of the germanium since the germanium forms a higher melting point solid solution with the silicon in the film. Control of the thickness of the germanium film is critical as it was shown that thicker layers result in lower strength bonds due to differences in thermal expansion and the maximum service temperature is lower due to the lower liquidus temperature of the leaner Ge-Si solid solution. This technique has potential applications in fuel cells due to the small differences in thermal expansion coefficients and firing shrinkages among the fuel cell materials, thus allowing successful fabrication and joining process of the monolithic solid oxide fuel cell (MSOFC) with few defects...|$|R

The multivolume method is based on ensuring the equilibrium of the considered volume on an average basis. In the same (average) way, the continuity conditions of displacements and tractions at the interfaces between subcells and between neighboring representative elements are imposed, resulting in a homogenization procedure that eliminates the discrete nature of the composite model.

To date, random intermixing and entropic effects in these systems have largely been associated with crystalline disorder and glassy phases. Here we describe a 2 D crystalline self-assembled molecular system that exhibits random incorporation of substitutional molecules. The lattice is formed from a mixture of trimesic acid (TMA) and terthienobenzenetricarboxylic acid (TTBTA), C 3 -symmetric hydrogen-bonding units of very different sizes (0. 79 and 1. 16 nm, respectively), at the solution–highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG) interface. Remarkably, the TTBTA substitutes into the TMA lattice at a fixed stoichiometry near 12 %. The resulting lattice constant is consistent with Vegard’s law prediction for an alloy with a composition TMA 0. 88 TTBTA 0. 12, and the substrate orientation of the lattice is defined by an epitaxial relation with the HOPG substrate. The Gibbs free energy for the TMA/TTBTA lattice was elucidated by considering the entropy of intermixing, via Monte Carlo simulations of multiplicity of the substitutional lattices, and the enthalpy of intermixing, via density functional theory calculations. The latter show that both the <b>bond</b> enthalpy <b>of</b> the H-bonded lattice and the adsorption enthalpy of the molecule/substrate interactions play important roles. This work provides insight into the manifestation of entropy in a molecular crystal constrained by both epitaxy and intermolecular interactions and demonstrates that a randomly intermixed yet crystalline 2 D solid can be formed through hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>of</b> molecular building <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> very different size...|$|R

40|$|Block {{copolymers}} {{are capable}} of self-assembling into structures on the 10 - 100 nm length scale. Structures of this size are attractive for applications such as nanopatterning and electrochemical membrane materials. However, block copolymer self-assembly in these examples {{is complicated by the}} presence of surfaces in the case of thin films and the presence of an additive, such as an ionic liquid, in the case of electrochemical membrane materials. Improved understanding of the structure and thermodynamics of such systems is necessary for the development of structure-property relationships in applications for block copolymers, such as nanopatterning and electrochemical devices. To address the challenge <b>of</b> <b>block</b> copolymer thin film characterization over large areas, resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) has been applied to characterize order formation in copolymer thin films. Using theory and experiment, the dramatic chemical sensitivity of RSoXS to subtle differences in the <b>bonding</b> energies <b>of</b> different <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> a copolymer is demonstrated. The unambiguous identification of structure and domain size in block copolymer thin films using RSoXS enables a quantitative comparison <b>of</b> the bulk <b>block</b> copolymer structure and domain size, leading to improved understanding of the impact <b>of</b> surfaces on <b>block</b> copolymer self-assembly. The self-assembly <b>of</b> <b>block</b> copolymer/ionic liquid mixtures has been characterized as a function <b>of</b> <b>block</b> copolymer composition and molecular weight, mixture composition, and temperature using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), optical transmission characterization, wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The resulting phase behavior is reminiscent to that <b>of</b> <b>block</b> copolymer mixtures with a selective molecular solvent and lamellar, cylindrical, ordered spherical micelles, and disordered phases are observed. Analysis of order-disorder transitions and molecular weight scaling analysis qualitatively indicates that the segregation strength between block copolymer phases increases with ionic liquid loading. DSC characterization of the thermal properties <b>of</b> the <b>block</b> copolymer/ionic liquid mixtures reveals two composition dependent regimes. At high block copolymer concentrations, a "salt-like" regime corresponding to an increase in the block copolymer glass transition temperature is observed, while at intermediate block copolymer concentrations, a "solvent-like" regime corresponding to a decrease in the block copolymer glass transition temperature is observed.
