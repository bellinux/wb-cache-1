25|$|A silver {{glass mirror}} is an {{ordinary}} mirror, coated on its <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> with silver, which produces images by reflection. This kind of glass mirror {{is produced by}} coating a silver, copper film and two or more layers of waterproof paint on the <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> of float glass, which perfectly resists acid and moisture. A silver glass mirror provides clear and actual images, is quite durable, and is widely used for furniture, bathroom and other decorative purposes.|$|E

25|$|In August 1959, Noyce {{formed at}} Fairchild {{a group to}} develop {{integrated}} circuits. On May 26, 1960, this group, led by Jay Last, produced the first planar integrated circuit. This prototype was not monolithic – two pairs of its transistors were isolated by cutting a groove on the chip, according to the patent by Last. The initial production stages repeated the Hoerni's planar process. Then the 80-micron-thick crystal was glued, face down, to the glass substrate, and additional photolithography was carried on the <b>back</b> <b>surface.</b> Deep etching created a groove down to the front surface. Then the <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> was covered with an epoxy resin, and the chip was separated from the glass substrate.|$|E

The front surfaces of all lenses were flat, and the <b>back</b> <b>surfaces</b> were made aspherical as conicoids. Merte {{did not provide}} a derivation of his formulae for the appropriate conicoidal surfaces. We show that Merte formula is correct and describe that nature of appropriate conicoidal <b>back</b> <b>surfaces</b> of spectacle lenses...|$|R
25|$|A {{safety glass}} mirror {{is made by}} {{adhering}} a special protective film to the <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> of a silver glass mirror, which prevents injuries in case the mirror is broken. This kind of mirror is used for furniture, doors, glass walls, commercial shelves, or public areas.|$|E
25|$|A low {{aluminium}} {{glass mirror}} is manufactured by coating silver and {{two layers of}} protective paint on the <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> of glass. A low aluminium glass mirror is very clear, light transmissive, smooth, and reflects accurate natural colors. This type of glass is widely used for framing presentations and exhibitions in which a precise color representation of the artwork is truly essential or when the background color of the frame is predominantly white.|$|E
25|$|Mirrors are {{manufactured}} by applying a reflective coating to a suitable substrate. The most common substrate is glass, {{due to its}} transparency, ease of fabrication, rigidity, hardness, and ability to take a smooth finish. The reflective coating is typically applied to the <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> of the glass, so that the reflecting side of the coating is protected from corrosion and accidental damage by the glass {{on one side and}} the coating itself and optional paint for further protection on the other.|$|E

40|$|The aging {{behavior}} of chemically bonded interfaces between metals and pottants, such as {{ethylene vinyl acetate}} (EVA) was studied using the Dow Corning primer systems. It was observed that the primers seem to function as anticorrosive agents on metal surfaces. It was demonstrated that EVA, and the A- 11861 EVA/glass primer stops corrosion of the aluminum used on the <b>back</b> <b>surfaces</b> of crystalline silicon solar cells. However, this same treatment does not work for the aluminum on the <b>back</b> <b>surfaces</b> of amorphous silicon solar cells...|$|R

25|$|The {{inferior}} {{angle of}} the scapula is the lowest part of the scapula and is covered by the latissimus dorsi muscle. It moves forwards round the chest when the arm is abducted. The inferior angle is formed by the union of the medial and lateral borders of the scapula. It is thick and rough and its posterior or <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> affords attachment to the teres major and often to a few fibers of the latissimus dorsi. The anatomical plane that passes vertically through the inferior angle is named the scapular line.|$|E
25|$|The body, or gladiolus, is {{the longest}} part. It is flat and {{considered}} to have only a front and <b>back</b> <b>surface.</b> It is flat on the front, directed upward and forward, and marked by three transverse ridges which cross the bone opposite the third, fourth, and fifth articular depressions. The pectoralis major attaches to it on either side. At the junction of {{the third and fourth}} parts of the body is occasionally seen an orifice, the sternal foramen, of varying size and form. The posterior surface, slightly concave, is also marked by three transverse lines, less distinct, however, than those in front; from its lower part, on either side, the transversus thoracis takes origin.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s to 1930s, various card {{counters}} {{were produced}} in the UK, including the Little Dorrit counter, and the schoolgirl counter. From around 2006 Maik Remmers designed and manufactured in Germany a series of 3D card counters {{in the shape of}} skeins of wool, animals and abstract designs. These are folded and printed on back and front, with a pair of rotatable number discs sandwiched between the layers of card. The discs can be rotated to reveal numerals through two windows in the front layer of card. The outer surface of the card can be written-on with water-soluble ink, and the <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> of the counter contains a form where the knitter can fill in current row numbers. This is necessary as there is not enough friction to prevent the number discs from moving during storage.|$|E
50|$|Embossing is a {{printing}} technique {{used to create}} raised surfaces in the converted paper stock. The process relies upon mated dies that press the paper into a shape that can be observed on both the front and <b>back</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|R
50|$|Interference {{can also}} be seen in {{everyday}} phenomena such as iridescence and structural coloration. For example, the colours seen in a soap bubble arise from interference of light reflecting off the front and <b>back</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the thin soap film. Depending on the thickness of the film, different colours interfere constructively and destructively.|$|R

Note the two levels of coloration around the dark-light interface, arising {{from the fact that}} the photochromic molecules are located in two thin films (on the front and <b>back</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the lens).|$|R
500|$|The {{human heart}} is {{situated}} in the middle mediastinum, {{at the level of}} thoracic vertebrae T5-T8. A double-membraned sac called the pericardium surrounds the heart and attaches to the mediastinum. The <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> of the heart lies near the vertebral column, and the front surface sits behind the sternum and rib cartilages. The upper part of the heart is the attachment point for several large blood vessels – the venae cavae, [...] aorta and pulmonary trunk. The upper part of the heart is located {{at the level of the}} third costal cartilage. The lower tip of the heart, the apex, lies to the left of the sternum (8 to 9cm from the midsternal line) between the junction of the fourth and fifth ribs near their articulation with the costal cartilages.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most diurnal primates, {{but like}} all strepsirhine primates, the ring-tailed lemur has a tapetum lucidum, or {{reflective}} layer behind the retina of the eye, that enhances night vision. [...] The tapetum is highly visible in this species because the pigmentation of the ocular fundus (<b>back</b> <b>surface</b> of the eye), which is present in—but varies between—all lemurs, is very spotty. [...] The ring-tailed lemur also has a rudimentary foveal depression on the retina. [...] Another shared characteristic with the other strepsirrhine primates is the rhinarium, a moist, naked, glandular nose supported by the upper jaw and protruding beyond the chin. [...] The rhinarium continues down where it divides the upper lip. [...] The upper lip {{is attached to the}} premaxilla, preventing the lip from protruding and thus requiring the lemur to lap water rather than using suction.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{consequence}} of light pressure, Einstein in 1909 predicted the existence of [...] "radiation friction" [...] which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, “radiation will exert pressure {{on both sides of}} the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the <b>back</b> <b>surface.</b> The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.” ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. A series of experimental studies were conducted for low velocity {{impact on a}} composite box containing water in order to study the Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI). Finally, a computational {{study was conducted to}} supplement the experimental study. The water level inside the composite box was varied incrementally from 0 % (i. e. no water) to 100 % (full water). The impact velocity was also changed. In the experimental study, strain gages and the load cell were used to measure the strain responses at the front, side, and <b>back</b> <b>surfaces</b> as well as the impact force. The results showed that the FSI effect was significant to the structural responses depending on the water level. The effect of the baffle was different among the front, side and <b>back</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Both experimental and numerical results agreed well. Naval Postgraduate Schoo...|$|R
5000|$|Heidmann {{proposed}} {{that if the}} front <b>surfaces</b> and <b>back</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the shadows were rendered in separate passes, the number of front faces and back faces {{in front of an}} object can be counted using the stencil buffer. If an object's surface is in shadow, there will be more front facing shadow surfaces between it and the eye than <b>back</b> facing shadow <b>surfaces.</b> If their numbers are equal, however, the surface of the object is not in shadow. The generation of the stencil mask works as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|When light shines onto {{a bubble}} {{it appears to}} change colour. Unlike those seen in a rainbow, which arise from {{differential}} refraction, the colours seen in a soap bubble arise from interference of light reflecting off the front and <b>back</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the thin soap film. Depending on {{the thickness of the}} film, different colours interfere constructively and destructively.|$|R
2500|$|A full area {{metal contact}} is {{made on the}} <b>back</b> <b>surface,</b> and a grid-like metal contact made up of fine [...] "fingers" [...] and larger [...] "bus bars" [...] are {{screen-printed}} onto the front surface using a silver paste. This is an evolution of the so-called [...] "wet" [...] process for applying electrodes, first described in a US patent filed in 1981 by Bayer AG. The rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear, though some designs employ a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in ohmic contact with the silicon. Some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency. After the metal contacts are made, the solar cells are interconnected by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into modules or [...] "solar panels". Solar panels have a sheet of tempered glass on the front, and a polymer encapsulation on the back.|$|E
50|$|Although {{corrective}} lenses {{can be produced}} in many different profiles, the most common is ophthalmic or convex-concave. In an ophthalmic lens, both the front and <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> have a positive radius, resulting in a positive / convergent front surface and a negative / divergent <b>back</b> <b>surface.</b> The difference in curvature between {{the front and rear}} surface leads to the corrective power of the lens. In hyperopia a convergent lens is needed, therefore the convergent front surface overpowers the divergent <b>back</b> <b>surface.</b> For myopia the opposite is true: the divergent <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> is greater in magnitude than the convergent front surface. To correct for presbyopia, the lens, or section of the lens, must be more convergent or less divergent than the person's distance lens.|$|E

Results indicate that, for the very thin samples used in in situ TEM irradiation experiments the presence of surfaces affect dramatically the damage produced. At this particular energy, the ion has sufficient energy to damage both the top and the <b>back</b> <b>surfaces</b> and still leave the sample through the bottom.
