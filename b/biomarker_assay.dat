Accurate and frequent assessment of RA disease activity {{is critical to}} optimal treatment planning. A novel algorithm has been developed to determine a multi-biomarker disease activity (MBDA) score based upon measurement of the concentrations of 12 serum biomarkers in multiplex format. <b>Biomarker</b> <b>assays</b> from several different platforms were used in feasibility studies to identify biomarkers of potential significance. These assays were adapted to a multiplex platform for training and validation of the algorithm. In this study, the analytical performance of the underlying <b>biomarker</b> <b>assays</b> and the MBDA score was evaluated. Quantification of 12 biomarkers was performed with multiplexed sandwich immunoassays in three panels. Biomarker-specific capture antibodies were bound to specific locations in each well; detection antibodies were labeled with electrochemiluminescent tags.

40|$|Abstract Introduction The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a clinical-grade, automated, {{multiplex}} system for the differential diagnosis and molecular stratification of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods We profiled autoantibodies, cytokines, and bone-turnover products in sera from 120 patients with a diagnosis of RA of < 6 months' duration, as well as in sera from 27 patients with ankylosing spondylitis, 28 patients with psoriatic arthritis, and 25 healthy individuals. We used a commercial bead assay to measure cytokine levels and developed an array assay based on novel multiplex technology (Immunological Multi-Parameter Chip Technology) to evaluate autoantibody reactivities and bone-turnover markers. Data were analyzed by Significance Analysis of Microarrays and hierarchical clustering software. Results We developed a highly reproducible, automated, multiplex <b>biomarker</b> <b>assay</b> that can reliably distinguish between RA patients and healthy individuals or patients with other inflammatory arthritides. Identification of distinct biomarker signatures enabled molecular stratification of early-stage RA into clinically relevant subtypes. In this initial study, multiplex measurement of a subset of the differentiating biomarkers provided high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnostic discrimination of RA: Use of 3 biomarkers yielded a sensitivity of 84. 2 % and a specificity of 93. 8 %, and use of 4 biomarkers a sensitivity of 59. 2 % and a specificity of 96. 3 %.

40|$|Laboratory {{diagnostics}} are {{an essential}} and indispensible component of modern medicine. Large central laboratories {{have led to}} vast improvements {{in health care and}} now {{play a key role in}} the diagnosis and monitoring of therapy. Recent trends, however, indicate a rising need for on-site testing, for instance, in medical practices, operating theatres, outpatient clinics or emergency rooms. Cleverly engineered, compact products made possible due to advances in nanotechnology, molecular diagnostics, information technology and microfluidics can now meet this demand. These portable devices offer immediate access to a range of diagnostic parameters and thus help the medical caregiver to diagnose a case faster and make timely decisions about therapy. The commercial availability of compact and portable diagnostic devices has led to the widespread practice of what is now termed ‘Point-of-Care Testing’ (POCT). In this work, a microfluidic based platform for sensitive and quantitative detection of diagnostic targets suitable for POCT is reported. The analyte particles are detected through a magnetic bead based fluorescence sandwich immunoassay. The beads constitute both the solid phase for immobilization of capture molecules and enable active manipulation by external magnetic fields. Rather than pumping various assay buffers into a chamber, the solid phase is moved through stationary aqueous buffer contained in several chambers. This is done by focusing the beads into a tiny aggregate, which then is moved through capillary stop valve structures separating the chambers. After traversing such a valve, the bead aggregate is re-dispersed to form pearl-chain microstirrers using rotating magnetic field actuation. In this way efficient and fast incubation and washing procedures are enabled. The assay scheme includes i) incubation of the sample with beads, ii) washing, iii) labeling with fluorescence detection antibody and iv) fluorescence detection. The cartridge itself is manufactured by cost effective microinjection molding and the periphery consist of magnets mounted onto translational stages. The assays chosen for the evaluation included a biomarker (Interleukin- 8) and a viral pathogen (Hepatitis A Virus), which yielded detection limits of 1. 49 pg/mL (0. 188 pM) for the <b>biomarker</b> <b>assay</b> and 104 virus particles/ml for the virus assay.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{develop an}} enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to {{quantify}} the levels of specific aggrecan fragments generated by aggrecanase-mediated cleavage at the 373 Glu– 374 Ala bond within the aggrecan interglobular domain. MethodsThe ELISA employs a commercially available monoclonal antibody to capture aggrecan fragments containing keratan sulfate (KS). Aggrecan fragments generated by cleavage at the Glu–Ala bond were then detected using a monoclonal neoepitope antibody (mAb OA- 1) that specifically recognizes the N-terminal sequence ‘ARGSVIL’. ResultsThe mAb OA- 1 antibody was highly specific for the immunizing neoepitope peptide since neither peptides spanning the cleavage site nor mutated peptides were detected. Aggrecan fragments generated by ADAMTS- 4 digested human aggrecan monomers and from IL- 1 -stimulated human cartilage explants were quantified by the ELISA, and we observed increased sensitivity of the ELISA compared to mAb OA- 1 Western analysis. We also observed that the basal, as well as IL- 1 -stimulated production of ARGS aggrecan fragments from human articular cartilage explants was blocked by a selective aggrecanase inhibitor, consistent with generation of the ARGS neoepitope in human articular cartilage being mediated by aggrecanase. Using purified human aggrecan digested by ADAMTS- 4 as standard to quantify ARGS aggrecan fragments in human synovial fluids, we determined that the calculated amount of ARGSVIL-aggrecan fragments by ELISA measurement is {{in agreement with the}} published levels of these fragments, supporting its potential utility as a <b>biomarker</b> <b>assay</b> for osteoarthritis. ConclusionWe have developed an assay that detects and quantifies specific aggrecan fragments generated by aggrecanase-mediated cleavage.

Detection of biomarkers by mass spectrometry overcomes this disadvantage and the approach {{can be applied to}} all diseases. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 DE) was used to find differences in proteins in plasma samples from patients with varying liver fibrosis stages. The identified proteins were potential liver fibrosis biomarkers.

40|$|The {{discrepancy}} between the ecological significance of amphipods in the Antarctic and our poor knowledge of their ecofunctional role calls {{for a more detailed}} investigation of their trophic status in this ecosystem. A total of 12 amphipod species from suspension feeder to scavenger have been considered in this study. Our objective was to investigate whether the combination of fatty-acid and stable-isotope signatures into a 2 -dimensional trophic <b>biomarker</b> <b>assay</b> would increase accuracy in the identification of Antarctic benthic amphipod trophic position. Amphipod isotopic averages ranged from - 29. 3 ‰ (d 13 C) and 4. 1 %o (d 15 N) for the suspension feeder Ampelisca richardsoni to - 21. 7 ‰ (d 13 C) and 11. 9 ‰ (d 15 N) for the high predator Iphimediella sp. Cluster analysis of the fatty-acid composition separated the amphipod species into 4 trophic groups: suspension feeders, macro-herbivores, omnivores and scavengers. The suspension feeder was isolated due to an important proportion of 18 : 4 (n- 3), a fatty-acid biomarker of phytoplankton. Macro-herbivores were found to rely heavily on macroalgal carbon, containing a high percentage of arachidonic acid (20 : 4 (n- 6)). Scavenger amphipods revealed a unique fatty-acid composition dominated by 1 single fatty acid, 18 : 1 (n- 9), probably the result of a very intensive de novo biosynthesis to cope with starvation periods. Our data emphasise the need to combine different types of information to be able to draw the right conclusions regarding trophic ecology. Indeed, in some cases, the exclusive use of 1 type of tracing method, fatty acids or stable isotopes, would have resulted in misleading/false conclusions in the trophic classification of amphipods.

The critical problem affecting biomarker performance is patient heterogeneity involving the cause, context (including comorbidity and baseline renal function), and timing of the injury. We suggest strategies for stratifying subjects to provide appropriate context, and illustrate a creatinine-independent method for defining thresholds for biomarker concentrations in these contexts which utilizes the same sensitivity for the clinical outcomes of dialysis or death. Large multicenter cohort studies are needed to validate the proposed cutoffs...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{characterization}} of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) {{in the bone}} marrow (BM) of breast cancer (BC) patients has been hindered by their rarity. To enrich for these cells using an antigen-independent methodology, we have evaluated a size-based microfiltration device in combination with several downstream <b>biomarker</b> <b>assays.</b> BM aspirates were collected from healthy volunteers or BC patients. Healthy BM was mixed with a specified number of BC cells to calculate recovery and fold enrichment by microfiltration. Specimens were pre-filtered using a 70 μm mesh sieve and the effluent filtered through CellSieve microfilters. Captured cells were analyzed by immunocytochemistry (ICC), FISH for HER- 2 /neu gene amplification status, and RNA in situ hybridization (RISH). Cells eluted from the filter were used for RNA isolation and subsequent qRT-PCR analysis for DTC biomarker gene expression. Filtering an average of 14 × 106 nucleated BM cells yielded approximately 17 - 21 × 103 residual BM cells. In the BC cell spiking experiments, an average of 87 % (range 84 - 92 %) of tumor cells were recovered with approximately 170 - to 400 -fold enrichment. Captured BC cells from patients co-stained for cytokeratin and EpCAM, but not CD 45 by ICC. RNA yields from 4 ml of patient BM after filtration averaged 135 ng per 10 million BM cells filtered with an average RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of 5. 3. DTC-associated gene expression was detected by both qRT-PCR and RISH in filtered spiked or BC patient specimens but, not in control filtered normal BM. We have tested a microfiltration technique for enrichment of BM DTCs. DTC capture efficiency was shown to range from 84. 3 % to 92. 1 % with up to 400 -fold enrichment using model BC cell lines. In patients, recovered DTCs can be identified and distinguished from normal BM cells using multiple antibody-, DNA-, and RNA-based <b>biomarker</b> <b>assays...</b>|$|R
