5|$|An {{oxide layer}} forms around <b>beryllium</b> that {{prevents}} further reactions with air unless heated above 1000°C. Once ignited, <b>beryllium</b> burns brilliantly forming {{a mixture of}} <b>beryllium</b> oxide and <b>beryllium</b> nitride. <b>Beryllium</b> dissolves readily in non-oxidizing acids, such as HCl and diluted H2SO4, but not in nitric acid or water as this forms the oxide. This behavior {{is similar to that}} of aluminium metal. <b>Beryllium</b> also dissolves in alkali solutions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryllium</b> nitride, Be3N2 is a {{high-melting-point}} compound {{which is}} readily hydrolyzed. <b>Beryllium</b> azide, BeN6 is known and <b>beryllium</b> phosphide, Be3P2 {{has a similar}} structure to Be3N2. Basic <b>beryllium</b> nitrate and basic <b>beryllium</b> acetate have similar tetrahedral structures with four <b>beryllium</b> atoms coordinated to a central oxide ion. A number of <b>beryllium</b> borides are known, such as Be5B, Be4B, Be2B, BeB2, BeB6 and BeB12. <b>Beryllium</b> carbide, Be2C, is a refractory brick-red compound that reacts with water to give methane. No <b>beryllium</b> silicide has been identified.|$|E
5|$|Pure <b>beryllium</b> metal did {{not become}} readily {{available}} until 1957, {{even though it had}} been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier. <b>Beryllium</b> could be produced by reducing <b>beryllium</b> compounds such as <b>beryllium</b> chloride with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently most <b>beryllium</b> is produced by reducing <b>beryllium</b> fluoride with purified magnesium. The price on the American market for vacuum-cast <b>beryllium</b> ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Solutions of <b>beryllium</b> salts, e.g. <b>beryllium</b> sulfate and <b>beryllium</b> nitrate, are acidic {{because of}} {{hydrolysis}} of the 2+ ion.|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} <b>beryllium</b> in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published {{as an international}} voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with <b>beryllium</b> bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for <b>beryllium</b> concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing <b>beryllium</b> concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested {{on a variety of}} surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory <b>beryllium</b> oxide and siliceous <b>beryllium</b> (ASTM D7458).|$|E
5|$|Because of its stiffness, {{light weight}} and {{dimensional}} stability {{over a wide}} temperature range, <b>beryllium</b> metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and aerospace industries in high-speed aircraft, guided missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Several liquid-fuel rockets have used rocket nozzles made of pure <b>beryllium.</b> <b>Beryllium</b> powder was itself studied as a rocket fuel, but this use has never materialized. A small number of extreme high-end bicycle frames have been built with <b>beryllium.</b> From 1998 to 2000, the McLaren Formula One team used Mercedes-Benz engines with beryllium-aluminium-alloy pistons. The use of <b>beryllium</b> engine components was banned following a protest by Scuderia Ferrari.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryllium</b> {{improves}} many {{physical properties}} when added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy <b>beryllium</b> copper), iron and nickel. <b>Beryllium</b> does not form oxides {{until it reaches}} very high temperatures. Tools made of <b>beryllium</b> copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make <b>beryllium</b> metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Because of its low density and atomic mass, <b>beryllium</b> is relatively transparent to X-rays {{and other forms of}} ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors. The high thermal conductivities of <b>beryllium</b> and <b>beryllium</b> oxide have led to their use in thermal management applications.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryllium</b> oxide, BeO, {{is a white}} {{refractory}} solid, {{which has}} the wurtzite crystal structure and a thermal conductivity as high as in some metals. BeO is amphoteric. Salts of <b>beryllium</b> can be produced by treating Be(OH)2 with acid. <b>Beryllium</b> sulfide, selenide and telluride are known, all having the zincblende structure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryllium</b> {{was used}} by the Manhattan Project as a neutron reflector, and as a {{component}} of modulated neutron initiators. Only one firm produced it commercially in the United States, Brush <b>Beryllium</b> in Lorain, Ohio. The Ames Project began working on a production process in December 1943, reducing <b>beryllium</b> fluoride in a bomb with metallic magnesium and a sulphur booster. The main difficulty with working with <b>beryllium</b> was its high toxicity. A closed bomb was used to minimize the possibility of producing toxic <b>beryllium</b> dust. The process worked, but the high temperatures and pressures created by the magnesium sulphide meant that it was potentially explosive. An alternative was then developed using <b>beryllium</b> fluoride in a bomb with metallic calcium and a lead chloride booster. The metal was cast in a vacuum. Research was still ongoing when the war ended.|$|E
5|$|Both {{stable and}} {{unstable}} isotopes of <b>beryllium</b> are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long. It {{is believed that}} most of the stable <b>beryllium</b> in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust. Primordial <b>beryllium</b> contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore <b>beryllium</b> is a monoisotopic element.|$|E
5|$|Early {{researchers}} tasted <b>beryllium</b> and {{its various}} compounds for sweetness {{in order to}} verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt {{should be made to}} ingest this highly toxic substance. <b>Beryllium</b> and its compounds should be handled with great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of <b>beryllium</b> dust (lung cancer is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium-laden dust). Although the use of <b>beryllium</b> compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to <b>beryllium</b> exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of <b>beryllium</b> metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.|$|E
5|$|Electrolysis of {{a mixture}} of <b>beryllium</b> {{fluoride}} and sodium fluoride was used to isolate <b>beryllium</b> during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the alkali metals. Early in the 20th century, the production of <b>beryllium</b> by the thermal decomposition of <b>beryllium</b> iodide was investigated following {{the success of a}} similar process for the production of zirconium, but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.|$|E
5|$|Mixing about 2.0% <b>beryllium</b> into copper {{forms an}} alloy called <b>beryllium</b> copper that is six times {{stronger}} than copper alone. <b>Beryllium</b> alloys {{are used in}} many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, high strength and hardness, nonmagnetic properties, as well as good corrosion and fatigue resistance. These applications include non-sparking tools that are used near flammable gases (<b>beryllium</b> nickel), in springs and membranes (<b>beryllium</b> nickel and <b>beryllium</b> iron) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices. As little as 50 parts per million of <b>beryllium</b> alloyed with liquid magnesium leads to {{a significant increase in}} oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability.|$|E
5|$|The James Webb Space Telescope {{will have}} 18 {{hexagonal}} <b>beryllium</b> sections for its mirrors. Because JWST {{will face a}} temperature of 33 K, the mirror is made of gold-plated <b>beryllium,</b> capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. <b>Beryllium</b> contracts and deforms less than glass – and remains more uniform – in such temperatures. For the same reason, the optics of the Spitzer Space Telescope are entirely built of <b>beryllium</b> metal.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{electrolysis}} of a molten {{mixture of}} <b>beryllium</b> fluoride and sodium fluoride by Paul Lebeau in 1898 {{resulted in the}} first pure (99.5 to 99.8%) samples of <b>beryllium.</b> The first commercially successful process for producing <b>beryllium</b> was developed in 1932 by Alfred Stock and Hans Goldschmidt. Their process involves the electrolysis of a mixture of <b>beryllium</b> fluorides and barium, which causes molten <b>beryllium</b> to collect on a water-cooled iron cathode.|$|E
5|$|The {{toxicity}} of finely divided <b>beryllium</b> (dust or powder, mainly encountered in industrial settings where <b>beryllium</b> is produced or machined) is very well-documented. Solid <b>beryllium</b> metal does not carry the same hazards as airborne inhaled dust, but any hazard associated with physical contact is poorly documented. Workers handling finished <b>beryllium</b> pieces are routinely advised {{to handle them}} with gloves, both as a precaution and because many if not most applications of <b>beryllium</b> cannot tolerate residue of skin contact such as fingerprints.|$|E
5|$|Because of its low {{atomic number}} and very low {{absorption}} for X-rays, {{the oldest and}} {{still one of the}} most important applications of <b>beryllium</b> is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes. Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of <b>beryllium</b> to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin <b>beryllium</b> foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of synchrotron radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from <b>beryllium.</b> In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of <b>beryllium</b> because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryllium</b> also {{releases}} neutrons under bombardment by gamma rays. Thus, natural <b>beryllium</b> bombarded {{either by}} alphas or gammas from a suitable radioisotope {{is a key}} component of most radioisotope-powered nuclear reaction neutron sources for the laboratory production of free neutrons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryllium</b> forms binary {{compounds}} {{with many}} non-metals. Anhydrous halides {{are known for}} F, Cl, Br and I. BeF2 has a silica-like structure with corner-shared BeF4 tetrahedra. BeCl2 and BeBr2 have chain structures with edge-shared tetrahedra. All <b>beryllium</b> halides have a linear monomeric molecular structure in the gas phase.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryllium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. It {{is a relatively}} rare element in the universe, usually occurring {{as a product of}} the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars <b>beryllium</b> is depleted as it is fused and creates larger elements. It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals. Notable gemstones which contain <b>beryllium</b> include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and chrysoberyl. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryllium</b> is a {{component}} of several dental alloys.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryllium</b> is {{a health}} and safety issue for workers. Exposure to <b>beryllium</b> in the {{workplace}} {{can lead to a}} sensitization immune response and can over time develop chronic <b>beryllium</b> disease (CBD). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States researches these effects in collaboration with a major manufacturer of <b>beryllium</b> products. The goal of this research is to prevent sensitization and CBD by developing {{a better understanding of the}} work processes and exposures that may present a potential risk for workers, and to develop effective interventions that will reduce the risk for adverse health effects. NIOSH also conducts genetic research on sensitization and CBD, independently of this collaboration. The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods contains methods for measuring occupational exposures to <b>beryllium.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryllium</b> is a steel {{gray and}} hard metal that is brittle at room {{temperature}} and has a close-packed hexagonal crystal structure. It has exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus 287 GPa) and a reasonably high melting point. The modulus of elasticity of <b>beryllium</b> is approximately 50% {{greater than that of}} steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in <b>beryllium</b> – about 12.9km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make <b>beryllium</b> the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryllium</b> is {{also used}} at the Joint European Torus nuclear-fusion {{research}} laboratory, {{and it will be}} used in the more advanced ITER to condition the components which face the plasma. <b>Beryllium</b> has also been proposed as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods, because of its good combination of mechanical, chemical, and nuclear properties. <b>Beryllium</b> fluoride is one of the constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture FLiBe, which is used as a solvent, moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs, including the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR).|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryllium</b> may {{be found}} in coal slag. When the slag is {{formulated}} into an abrasive agent for blasting paint and rust from hard surfaces, the <b>beryllium</b> can become airborne and become a source of exposure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryllium</b> mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller <b>beryllium</b> mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the <b>beryllium</b> mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than <b>beryllium.</b> In some applications, though, the <b>beryllium</b> blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryllium</b> oxide {{is useful}} for many {{applications}} that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. <b>Beryllium</b> oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. <b>Beryllium</b> oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets. <b>Beryllium</b> compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryllium</b> {{production}} saw a {{rapid increase}} during World War II, {{due to the}} rising demand for hard beryllium-copper alloys and phosphors for fluorescent lights. Most early fluorescent lamps used zinc orthosilicate with varying content of <b>beryllium</b> to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light. Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after <b>beryllium</b> {{was found to be}} toxic.|$|E
5|$|The {{extraction}} of <b>beryllium</b> from its compounds {{is a difficult}} process due to its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures, {{and its ability to}} reduce water when its oxide film is removed. The United States, China and Kazakhstan are the only three countries involved in the industrial-scale {{extraction of}} <b>beryllium.</b> <b>Beryllium</b> production technology is in early stages of development in Russia after a 20-year hiatus.|$|E
5|$|The low {{weight and}} high {{rigidity}} of <b>beryllium</b> make it {{useful as a}} material for high-frequency speaker drivers. Because <b>beryllium</b> is expensive (many times more than titanium), hard to shape due to its brittleness, and toxic if mishandled, <b>beryllium</b> tweeters are limited to high-end home, pro audio, and public address applications. Some high-fidelity products have been fraudulently claimed {{to be made of}} the material.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} ores of <b>beryllium,</b> beryl and bertrandite, {{are found in}} Argentina, Brazil, India, Madagascar, Russia and the United States. Total world {{reserves}} of <b>beryllium</b> ore are greater than 400,000 tonnes.|$|E
5|$|May 21: Physicist Louis Slotin {{receives}} a fatal {{dose of radiation}} (2100 rems) when the screwdriver he was using to keep two <b>beryllium</b> hemispheres apart slips.|$|E
5|$|Some {{high-end}} phonograph cartridges used <b>beryllium</b> cantilevers {{to improve}} tracking by reducing mass.|$|E
5|$|Although group 12 {{lies in the}} d-block of {{the modern}} 18-column {{periodic}} table, the d electrons of zinc, cadmium, and (almost always) mercury behave as core electrons and do not take part in bonding. This behavior {{is similar to that}} of the main-group elements, but is in stark contrast to that of the neighboring group 11 elements (copper, silver, and gold), which also have filled d-subshells in their ground-state electron configuration but behave chemically as transition metals. For example, the bonding in chromium(II) sulfide (CrS) involves mainly the 3d electrons; that in iron(II) sulfide (FeS) involves both the 3d and 4s electrons; but that of zinc sulfide (ZnS) involves only the 4s electrons and the 3d electrons behave as core electrons. Indeed, useful comparison can be made between their properties and the first two members of group 2, <b>beryllium</b> and magnesium, and in earlier short-form periodic table layouts, this relationship is illustrated more clearly. For instance, zinc and cadmium are similar to <b>beryllium</b> and magnesium in their atomic radii, ionic radii, electronegativities, and also in the structure of their binary compounds and their ability to form complex ions with many nitrogen and oxygen ligands, such as complex hydrides and amines. However, <b>beryllium</b> and magnesium are small atoms, unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals and like the group 12 elements (which have a greater nuclear charge but the same number of valence electrons), and the periodic trends down group 2 from <b>beryllium</b> to radium (similar to that of the alkali metals) are not as smooth when going down from <b>beryllium</b> to mercury (which is more similar to that of the p-block main groups) due to the d-block and lanthanide contractions. It is also the d-block and lanthanide contractions that give mercury many of its distinctive properties.|$|E
5|$|An earlier major {{application}} of <b>beryllium</b> was in brakes for military airplanes {{because of its}} hardness, high melting point, and exceptional ability to dissipate heat. Environmental considerations have led to substitution by other materials.|$|E
5|$|As a metal, <b>beryllium</b> is {{transparent}} to most {{wavelengths of}} X-rays and gamma rays, making it {{useful for the}} output windows of X-ray tubes and other such apparatus.|$|E
