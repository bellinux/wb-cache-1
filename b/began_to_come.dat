5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the African coast on July 19. The system headed westward through the Atlantic Ocean {{for the next}} week with no change in development. After entering the Caribbean Sea on July 26, convection <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> together two days later due to the influence of anticyclonic flow. The disturbance passed the Yucatan Peninsula on July 29 and entered the Gulf of Mexico. No circulation was found in the developing system, however.|$|E
5|$|In 1745, Brettingham {{designed}} Gunton Hall in Norfolk for Sir William Harbord, {{three years}} after the former house on the site was gutted by fire. The new house of brick had a principal facade like that of Hanworth Hall, however, this larger house was seven bays deep, and had a large service wing on its western side. His commissions <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from further afield: Goodwood in Sussex and Marble Hill, Twickenham.|$|E

In 1993, Grumman updated the damage {{tolerance}} assessment and Force Structural Maintenance Plan and Damage Threat Assessment. Over the next few years, problems with wing structure fatigue, first noticed in production years earlier, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the fore. The process of implementing the maintenance plan was greatly delayed by the base re-alignment and closure commission (BRAC), which led to 80% of the original workforce being let go.|$|E

During the Second World War, it was briefly used as a machine-gun post. In the 21st century, it is managed by English Heritage and open to visitors, protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} {{eleventh}} century {{the church in}} Wales <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> under Norman influence, but Llanbadarn Fawr still essentially belonged to a Welsh world, that of an early Welsh clas, with its hereditary succession to the abbacy and its married clerics. The Church in Wales only gradually came {{under the influence of}} the see of Canterbury (and so of Rome) and even more slowly under its control. Wider political events however were to accelerate this.|$|E
5|$|No. 6 Commando led {{the brigade}} from the beach. Moving through a swamp that briefly slowed their progress, the commandos <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{up against the}} German defences {{that had not been}} {{destroyed}} by the naval bombardment. Where possible they attempted an indirect approach, penetrating the defences using infiltration tactics. However, as they advanced towards bridges that had been captured by the paratroopers earlier in the day, they assaulted four pillboxes as well as an artillery battery that had been firing on the landing beaches.|$|E

5|$|The 4th North Korean Division in the {{meantime}} was suffering serious logistical setbacks from lack of food, equipment, ammunition and, weapons. Conscripts from local South Korean villages were brought in to replace mounting losses. There was also virtually no provision for the wounded in the division, and the North Korean forces <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> apart under these stresses. Still, the division's morale remained relatively high and General Lee refused to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|After Martin's death, the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry {{began to}} buckle as {{increasing}} numbers of North Korean troops flooded into Chonan from the Northwest and eastern roads. The battalion suffered heavy casualties, but was saved by the continuous fire laid down by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion. Between 0800 and 1000, U.S. units began a disorganized retreat from the town, many soldiers deserting their units and running from the battle. Wadlington, now {{in command of the}} 34th Infantry, moved 3rd Battalion to a collecting point south of the town, where 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry was holding a blocking position and had not been engaged. As 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry began to pull back to rally points, 1st Battalion <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> under mortar fire from North Korean forces, but withdrew without engaging them.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundations}} that Jackson discovered {{during the}} excavations were left exposed {{for the benefit}} of visitors and larger numbers of tourists <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the castle to see the ruins, including Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte in 1846. The lead coffins in the chapel crypt were popular with tourists, although the coffins were extensively damaged by those visitors keen to see the contents inside. The south-west tower, completely covered by thick ivy, collapsed in 1842, after local children accidentally set fire to the vegetation that was, by then, holding the tower together. Battlements were added to the east gatehouse during this period, transforming the appearance of its original gabled roof.|$|E

5|$|After the Marianas <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> under attack, the United States {{military}} {{stepped up}} its raids on the Japanese-held islands {{which could be used}} to launch raids on the B-29 bases. Particular attention was given to Iwo Jima, as it was correctly assumed that the Japanese aircraft which attacked the Marianas were flying from Japan and staging through the island en route to their targets. Following the first raid against Saipan in November, XXI Bomber Command B-29s were dispatched against Iwo Jima's airfields on November5 and 8. These attacks were primarily training missions and caused little damage. The first raid was unopposed by the Japanese, but the second was met by eight fighters which inflicted light damage on a B-29; this was the first combat damage suffered by any of XXI Bomber Command's aircraft. The Seventh Air Force also increased the number of B-24 Liberator attacks on Iwo Jima, and these attacked the island 30 times during November.|$|E
5|$|After the match, an in {{ring segment}} {{took place in}} which The Big Show, entered the ring and asked the crowd whether they thought {{he should have been}} in the Championship Scramble for the WWE Championship. SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, who portrays an {{on-screen}} authority figure for the SmackDown brand, then came to the ring and proceeded to insult the Big Show, and demanded that he leave the ring. Druids then came to the ring bringing a casket, and The Undertaker appeared on the TitanTron, telling Guerrero to either get in the casket herself or he would put her in it. Guerrero refused to enter the casket voluntarily, so The Undertaker <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to ringside. The Big Show held back Guerrero as The Undertaker came to the ring. Once he was in the ring, The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, but the Big Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero. He proceeded to attack The Undertaker, and restrained him to allow Guerrero to slap him and spit in his face.|$|E
5|$|From 343 BC onwards, {{in order}} to try and disrupt the peace, Demosthenes and his {{followers}} used every expedition and action of Philip to argue that he was breaking the peace. Finally, in 341 BC, matters <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to a head. Athens sent out new settlers to the cleruchs on the Chersonsese under the command of Diopeithes, who proceeded to ravage the territory of Cardia, an ally of Philip. Philip therefore wrote to the Athenians to demand that they desist, but in his speech 'On the Chersonese', Demosthenes persuaded the Athenians that since Athens was effectively at war with Philip anyway, {{there was no need to}} do what Philip asked; Diopeithes therefore continued to cause trouble in Thrace. Then, in the Third Philippic of approximately May 341 BC, Demosthenes accused Philip of breaking the peace by intervening in the affairs of Euboea. Finally, in the Fourth Philippic delivered later in 341 BC, Demosthenes argued that Athens should send an embassy to the Persian king, requesting money for a forthcoming war with Macedon. The embassy was sent, much to Philip's anger, but was sharply rebuffed by the Persians.|$|E

5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions {{of those who had}} helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she had told him she {{had been one of the}} people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E
5|$|In late July2014, {{computer}} models began {{to indicate the}} possible formation of a low-pressure area {{off the coast of}} southwestern Mexico, prompting the National Hurricane Center(NHC) to assess the region with a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis on July24. These forecasts <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to fruition on July28 when an area of thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave developed off the Mexican coast. Tracking westward in favorable conditions, the system organized over the following days. A tropical depression formed by 12:00UTC on July31. 6 hours later, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Iselle due to the system's organization and the detection of tropical storm-force winds by the MetOp-B scatterometer. At the time, Iselle was located roughly 1,075mi (1,730km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. Steady intensification continued after formation, with the NHC indicating the possibility of rapid intensification. on August1, Iselle began to develop an eye, and this progressive pattern of organization prompted the NHC to upgrade the storm to hurricane status at 00:00UTC the following day.|$|E
5|$|Seamans' {{establishment}} of an ad-hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant Nicholas E. Golovin in July 1961, to recommend a launch vehicle {{to be used in}} the Apollo program, represented a turning point in NASA's mission mode decision. This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice, and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode. Its consideration of LOR‚Äîas well as Houbolt's ceaseless work‚Äîplayed an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach. In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight, Joseph Shea, who became a champion of LOR. The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), which had much to lose from the decision, took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing on June 7, 1962.|$|E

5|$|The {{tensions}} between Stretford and the Estates Company <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{to a head}} in 1906, when in response to complaints in the press {{about the state of}} one particular road in the park, Trafford Park Road, Stretford issued formal notices demanding that all premises with frontage onto the road pay for its improvement. Further disputes over the standard of roads in the park followed until, in 1907, the Estates Company presented a petition to Lancashire County Council demanding that Trafford Park should be an urban district in its own right, independent of Stretford. The county council dismissed the petition, but later that year, following a petition organised by the Trafford Park Ratepayers Association, a new local government ward, Park Ward, was created within Stretford, The new ward did not include {{the western part of the}} park however, which remained under the control of Barton-upon-Irwell.|$|E
5|$|On 20 November 1992, a {{major fire}} {{occurred}} at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread {{damage to the}} Upper Ward. The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated {{as part of a}} long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms, and severely damaged more than 100 others. Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection. The fire spread through the roof voids and efforts continued through the night to contain the blaze, at great risk to the 200 fire-fighters involved. It was not until late afternoon that the blaze <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> under control, although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning. Along with the fire and smoke damage, one of the unintended effects of the fire-fighting was the considerable water damage to the castle; more than 1.5 million gallons of water were used to extinguish it, which in many ways caused more complex restoration problems than the fire.|$|E
5|$|Parker's injury {{extended}} into {{the beginning of}} the 2015‚Äì16 NBA season. He returned to action on November 4 against the Philadelphia 76ers in the fifth game of the season for the Bucks but struggled, posting just two points in 16 minutes as a starter. As he ramped up his activity, he was rested on the second of back-to-back games. Nonetheless, after five games, he endured a sprain in his talonavicular joint in the right mid-foot causing him to be expected to miss several games. He only missed one game. The following week, he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> off the bench while O. J. Mayo took his starting spot. On December 12, Parker had a 19-point, 7-rebound, 2-steal performance against the Golden State Warriors to help end their 24-game win streak. On January 27, 2016, he was named to the 2016 NBA All-Star Game weekend Rising Stars Challenge lineup. On February 19, he tied his career high with 23 points in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets. He surpassed that total the following night, recording career highs of 28 points and 13 rebounds in a 117‚Äì109 double-overtime win over the Atlanta Hawks. On February 29, Parker set a new career high with 36 points in a 128‚Äì121 Bucks victory over the Houston Rockets.|$|E
