40|$|Several {{tools are}} sold and {{recommended}} for closing and sealing flexible {{intermediate bulk containers}} (bulk bags) which are used to transport product that has been mined and processed. However, there is limited information on the risks, physical demands, or the benefits of using one tool over another. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the physical demands involved with two closing methods and several sealing tools in order to provide recommendations for selecting tools to reduce exposure to risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders. In this study, twelve participants completed bag closing and sealing tasks using two different closing methods and eight sealing tools on two types of bulk bags. Physical demands and performance were evaluated using muscle activity, perceived exertion, subjective ratings of use, and time. Results indicate that using the "flowering" method to close bags required on average 32 % less muscle activity, 30 % less perceived exertion, 42 % less time, and was preferred by participants compared to using the "snaking" method. For sealing, there was no single method significantly better across all measures; however, using a pneumatic cable tie gun consistently had the lowest muscle activity and perceived exertion ratings. The pneumatic cable tie gun did require approximately 33 % more time to seal the bag compared to methods without a tool, but the amount of time to seal the bag was comparable to using other tools. Further, sealing a spout <b>bulk</b> <b>bag</b> required on average 13 % less muscle activity, 18 % less perceived exertion, 35 % less time, and was preferred by participants compared to sealing a duffle <b>bulk</b> <b>bag.</b> The current results suggest that closing the spout bag using the flowering method and sealing the bag using the pneumatic cable tie gun that is installed with a tool balancer is ergonomically advantageous. Our findings can help organizations select methods and tools that pose the lowest physical demands when closing and sealing bulk bags.

40|$|Problems {{of quality}} {{maintenance}} are {{encountered in the}} marine transport from tropical and sub-tropical to temperate climatic zones, of hygroscopic durable foods such as cocoa beans and similar commodities, particularly in winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Cargoes frequently display damaging mould formation and insect infestation on unloading. This publication indicates {{the likelihood of the}} incidence of these problems for different modes of transport by ship (<b>bulk,</b> <b>bag</b> and box container). Interpretations are based upon the principles of heat and moisture transfer and experimental observations of several shipments. The mould problem is usually interpreted as arising from the migration of moisture from the interior of the cargo to its sides. It occurs when a temperature difference develops between the cargo interior and the frame of the ship's hold. With bulk commodities, the moisture problem can occur at the sides of the cargo if this is in direct contact with the sides of the ship. With bagged commodities, similar difficulties can arise, but they are less pronounced because of the beneficial effect of air circulation around the bags, particularly if dunnage is present. For box-container transport, the major risk of quality deterioration occurs in winter following offloading on the dockside. Dew can rapidly form {{on the underside of the}} container roof, and 'internal raining' with subsequent wetting and mould formation can occur with the associated risk of mycotoxin production. Closed box containers present the greatest hazard. Naturally ventilated and open-sided containers together with suitable modifications to handling practices are considered to be more suitable for the avoidance of this problem. General recommendations for good practice are also included in the text...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{flexible}} intermediate bulk container (FIBC), also called a <b>bulk</b> <b>bag,</b> to ship and store dry bulk materials is Cost-effective, making the container increasingly popular for material suppliers and users, {{as well as}} custom packagers and shippers. This article discusses two industry trends- reusing and recycling FIBCs-as well as some cautions and guidelines you should know about. About FIBCs An FIBC is typically constructed of woven polypropylene and has a square or rectangular base. The inlet at the top is typicall) equipped with a filling spout, although other styles are used foi certain materials (Figure 1). The base can have a discharge out. let of various types (Figure 1) or be plain (requiring the bottom to be slit for discharge, which destroys the FIBC). The mos common FIBC (also called an inledoutlet FIBC) has both a fill ing inlet and a discharge outlet, rather than a plain bottom. T he Flexible Intermediate Bulk Container Association (FIBCA) includes regular members (US FIBC manufacturers and suppliers to these manufacturers) and associate members (foreign FIBC manufacturers who have a US representative). The FIBCA {{has been working with}} other associations and US regulatory agencies to recommend safety standards for handling hazardous and nonhazardous materials in FIBCs. Making this work especially challenging are two FIBC industry trends driven by the industry's desire to remain both competitive and ecologically responsible: reusing and recycling FIBCs that handle nonhazardous materials. If you use FIBCs, you're probably aware that more users are reusing or recycling FIBCs. But are these practices safe? And do they save money or provide other benefits? A look at some FIBC basics will provide useful background information for discussing these issues. Lifting loops are located at the FIBC's top four comers to permi lifting by a forklift truck. The FIBC can be lined to protect thl material or prevent the material from contaminating the envi ronment, workers, or the FIBC. Capacity ranges from 500 t' 8, 000 pounds. The fabric and construction provide the FIBC' safety factor (expressed as a ratio); the manufacturer tests th FIBC's safety factor to ensure it meets or exceeds performan...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{monofilament}} macro-synthetic fibres in wet-mix shotcrete applications {{has grown}} significantly worldwide since their introduction {{in the late}} 90 ’s. As opposed to the stiffer steel fibres, which have to be used at relatively short lengths (30 mm) to reduce line blockage, the more flexible macro-synthetic fibres can typically be used, in well proportioned wet-mix shotcrete mixtures, at lengths ranging from 50 to 100 mm, without significantly reducing the pumpability and shootability of the mixture. Other reported benefits of macro-synthetic fibres over steel fibres in wet-mix shotcrete include reduced equipment wear and fibre rebound, and increased shotcrete layer built-up thickness. However, attempts to date to incorporate macro-synthetic fibres in dry-mix shotcrete have failed for numerous technical reasons. The problems encountered range from the inability to uniformly mix the fibres at the dry-batching plant using a standard mixing sequence, to fibres causing conduit blockage of the batching dispensing unit, fibres causing blockage of the dry material exiting from the <b>bulk</b> <b>bags,</b> fibre...|$|R

40|$|Today many {{companies}} face problems with WIP inventory management. The importance of effective WIP control and inventory management {{has become more}} evident {{in order to reduce}} manufacturing lead time. Managing WIP inventory is the focus of this dissertation. It combines theory obtained from literature, the manufacturing system analysis done throughout the ten weeks internship period in the company and the simulation results to explore the opportunities associated with how Reckitt Benckiser can improve the WIP control and management of Strepsils lozenges. This dissertation recognizes that WIP control and management is highly in interaction with batch sizes, space utilization and material flow independent from the production control system particularly for the Strepsils manufacturing environment. Furthermore, it explores the problems and some of the seven wastes defined by Taichi Ohno which are occurred due to poor control of these aspects. Hence, it emphasizes effective material handling in terms of storage, as well as the necessity of small batch production. It presents new material handling design and the operating procedure for logistical operations in the WIP inventory storage area to utilize space more effectively against the fullness risk of storage areas and to improve material flow. It indicates the necessity of simultaneous quality control at least for the bulks produced more and frequently to give more storage flexibility and to reduce manufacturing lead time. Also, it indicates the putting of colourful tags with <b>bag</b> numbers onto <b>bulk</b> <b>bags</b> to facilitate the visual identification. Besides, it recognizes the inadequacy of manufacturing performance and emphasizes the requirement of increased OEE figures to meet the demand based on the simulation results. Hereby, it proves that changeover time reduction of bulk production equipments is prerequisite both for improvement in manufacturing performance and for facilitating small batch production. Consequently, the explored opportunities will provide a more appropriate WIP control and inventory management to the company for Strepsils lozenges and also will directly improve the velocity through the factory of Strepsils...|$|R
40|$|Composting is one {{of several}} methods for {{treating}} biosolids to create a marketable end product that is easy to handle, store, and use.

40|$|Introduction In November 2011 archaeologists of City of Rotterdam Archaeological Service (BOOR) {{conducted}} underwater {{research in}} the Yangtze harbour, Rotterdam Maasvlakte, The Netherlands. The research {{was carried out by}} order of Port of Rotterdam Authority and supervised by the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands. The results of geological, botanical, zoological and archaeological analyses of the retrieved material generated new information on the occupation of a relatively high river dune by prehistoric hunter-gatherers, and on the development history of the surrounding landscape ca. 9, 000 years ago. Methods Rather than employing divers the underwater investigations were carried out on board a vessel using a wire-operated, horizontal closing grab. Three small trenches (total area ca. 375 m²) were excavated in layers in a fairly controlled fashion. Underwater excavations cannot achieve the same level of precision as is possible on land, but the many soil core samples taken in the project’s preliminary phase allowed detailed descriptions of the geomorphological stratigraphy. The excavation resulted in 316 <b>bulk</b> <b>bags</b> of soil. All soil was sieved on land, using sieves with mesh sizes of 10 and 2 mm, after which archaeologists and volunteers carefully sorted the residues, documenting a total of ca. 46, 000 finds. Results Plenty of Mesolithic occupation remains were retrieved at all three grab locations, from depths ranging between 17 to 21 m below modern MSL. The finds span the age range from ca. 8400 to 6500 BC, when the site transformed from dryland (an inland dune) to wetland (drowned delta subsurface). At the foot of the inland dune, the depositional conditions allowed for excellent preservation of bone, charcoal and plant material as well as stone artefacts. The site provides an unusually rich and detailed body of evidence on environmental conditions and the Middle Mesolithic palaeo-economy. The landscape ecotones around the site yielded an abundance of food while gradually being transformed, due to rising sea levels, from a valley containing the rivers Rhine and Meuse into the mouth area of those rivers. At 6500 BC, the site was finally transgressed: drowned in an estuary and swallowed up by the sea. Conclusion The Rotterdam Yangtze Harbour research project demonstrates the preservation of Mesolithic sites along the river Rhine, at depths in nowadays coastal and offshore areas. Furthermore, it demonstrates the feasibility of archaeological investigation of such submerged sites, even at depths of 18 to 20 m beneath sea, lake and harbour floors. Never before had such a submerged site been excavated at such a great depth. The scientific report (in English) will appear in the autumn of 2014, providing a full description of all finds as well as their landscape context...|$|R

40|$|Cement {{manufacturing}} has a {{high impact}} on the ecological environment from “quarry to lorry”. Starting from excavation of limestone, raw material crushing and milling, clinker manufacturing, cement grinding and <b>bulk</b> & <b>bag</b> material transportation demands use of natural resources {{in the form of}} material and energy. Driving of sustainability initiatives in the cement industry has gained focus {{over a period of time}} and reducing the non-renewable energy usage in the thermal process of clinker manufacturing has been identified as a key area to drive. In the traditional cement manufacturing process, the thermal energy demand of the cement kiln is supplied through the use of fuel such as coal and heavy furnace oil which is a non-renewable energy source. The initiative to replace traditional fuel usage by using alternative fuel derived from the industrial wastes unfolds cement industry to drive sustainability in two aspects. Firstly, through replacing coal and hence conserving a non-renewable energy and secondly through making the cement kilns available under controlled conditions to thermally destruct hazardous and non-hazardous waste and thereby providing an environmentally sound final destination to dispose their waste to the industrial waste generators. The paper discusses how the cement industry in Sri Lanka, specifically the only fully integrated cement manufacturing facility operated by Holcim (Lanka) Ltd. derives this model to deliver sustainability in the cement industry...|$|R
