25|$|Unlike {{the more}} {{continental}} {{climate of the}} Alta and Alavesa, the Rioja Baja is strongly influenced by a Mediterranean climate which makes this area the warmest and driest of the Rioja. In the summer months, drought can be a significant viticultural hazard, though since the late 1990s irrigation has been permitted. Temperatures in the summer typically reach 35°C (95 °F). A number of the vineyards are actually located in nearby Navarra but the wine produced from those grapes belongs to the Rioja appellation. Unlike the typically pale Rioja wine, Baja wines are very deeply coloured and can be highly alcoholic with some wines at 18% alcohol by volume. They typically do not have much acidity or aroma and are generally used as <b>blending</b> <b>components</b> with wines {{from other parts of}} the Rioja.|$|E
25|$|While California's wine regions can be {{generally}} {{classified as a}} Mediterranean climate, there are also regions with more continental dry climates. Proximity to the Pacific or bays as well as unobstructed access to the cool currents that come off them dictate the relative coolness of the wine region. Areas surrounded by mountain barriers, like some parts of Sonoma and Napa counties will be warmer {{due to the lack}} of this cooling influence. The soil types and landforms of California vary greatly, having been influenced by the plate tectonics of the North American and Pacific Plates. In some areas the soils can be so diverse that vineyards will establish blocks of the same vine variety planted on different soils for purpose of identifying different <b>blending</b> <b>components.</b> This diversity is one of the reasons why California has so many different and distinct American Viticultural Areas.|$|E
50|$|As {{depicted}} in Figure 2, {{some of the}} smaller alkanes are then broken and converted into even smaller alkenes and branched alkenes such as the gases ethylene, propylene, butylenes, and isobutylenes. Those olefinic gases are valuable for use as petrochemical feedstocks. The propylene, butylene and isobutylene are also valuable feedstocks for certain petroleum refining processes that convert them into high-octane gasoline <b>blending</b> <b>components.</b>|$|E

50|$|Dimerization unit {{converts}} olefins into higher-octane gasoline <b>blending</b> <b>components.</b> For example, butenes can be dimerized into isooctene {{which may}} subsequently be hydrogenated to form isooctane. There are also other uses for dimerization. Gasoline produced through dimerization is highly unsaturated and very reactive. It tends spontaneously to form gums. For this reason the effluent from the dimerization {{need to be}} blended into the finished gasoline pool immediately or hydrogenated.|$|E

50|$|Isoamylene is one {{of three}} main {{byproducts}} of deep catalytic cracking (DCC), a relatively new concept that is very similar to the operation of the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). The DCC uses vacuum gas oil (VGO) as a feedstock to produce primarily propylene, isobutylene, and isoamylene. The rise in demand for polypropylene has encouraged the growth of the DCCU, which is operated very much like an FCCU. Isobutylene and isoamylene are feedstocks necessary for the production of the much debated gasoline <b>blending</b> <b>components</b> methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME).|$|E

In this study, different percentages of hydrotreated renewable diesel and jet components were blended into an ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel and their effect on homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion and emissions performance was investigated.

40|$|The {{contributions}} of three major gasoline <b>blending</b> <b>components</b> (reformate, alkylate and cracked gasoline) to potential environmental impacts (PEI) are assessed. This study estimates losses of the gasoline <b>blending</b> <b>components</b> due to evaporation and leaks through their life cycle, from petroleum refining to vehicle refuelling. A sensitivity analysis {{is performed using}} different weighting factors for each potential environmental impact category, {{in order to assess}} the effect of each blending component on the total potential environmental impacts. The results indicate that reformate and cracked gasoline mainly contribute to photochemical oxidation followed by aquatic toxicity, terrestrial toxicity and human toxicity by ingestion. On the other hand, alkylate contributes mostly to aquatic toxicity but very little to photochemical oxidation. From the sensitivity analysis, a high weighting on the impact categories for aquatic toxicity, terrestrial toxicity and human toxicity by ingestion leads to alkylate having the largest potential impacts of the three <b>blending</b> <b>components,</b> whereas other combinations of weighting factors indicate that alkylate has the lowest potential impacts...|$|E

40|$|Cellulosic {{and woody}} biomass can be {{directly}} converted to hydrocarbon gasoline and diesel <b>blending</b> <b>components</b> {{through the use of}} integrated hydropyrolysis plus hydroconversion (IH 2). The IH 2 gasoline and diesel <b>blending</b> <b>components</b> are fully compatible with petroleum based gasoline and diesel, contain less than 1 % oxygen and have less than 1 total acid number (TAN). The IH 2 gasoline is high quality and very close to a drop in fuel. The DOE funding enabled rapid development of the IH 2 technology from initial proof-of-principle experiments through continuous testing in a 50 kg/day pilot plant. As part of this project, engineering work on IH 2 has also been completed to design a 1 ton/day demonstration unit and a commercial-scale 2000 ton/day IH 2 unit. These studies show when using IH 2 technology, biomass can be converted directly to transportation quality fuel <b>blending</b> <b>components</b> for the same capital cost required for pyrolysis alone, and {{a fraction of the cost}} of pyrolysis plus upgrading of pyrolysis oil. Technoeconomic work for IH 2 and lifecycle analysis (LCA) work has also been completed as part of this DOE study and shows IH 2 technology can convert biomass to gasoline and diesel <b>blending</b> <b>components</b> for less than $ 2. 00 /gallon with greater than 90 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. As a result of the work completed in this DOE project, a joint development agreement was reached with CRI Catalyst Company to license the IH 2 technology. Further larger-scale, continuous testing of IH 2 will be required to fully demonstrate the technology, and funding for this is recommended. The IH 2 biomass conversion technology would reduce U. S. dependence on foreign oil, reduce the price of transportation fuels, and significantly lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

In this study the potential for optimisation of a fuel blend using full boiling range synthetic <b>blending</b> <b>components</b> to enhance its performance in a modern charge boosted gasoline direct injection engine was investigated. An evaluation of detailed analytical fuel chemistry data was conducted followed by laminar ame speed experiments in a constant-volume combustion bomb apparatus in order to characterise the combustion behaviour of the <b>blending</b> <b>components</b> according to their characteristic chemical properties. A matrix of test fuels was established by splash blending the synthetic components with a commercial synthetic reference fuel. The performance of the fuels was subsequently evaluated using a modern, charge boosted, single cylinder GDI research engine. While the engine operation was verified {{to be in the}} negative-K region using model fuel components, anomalies in de fining the K-value using the synthetic blends were discovered. A fuel blending model was composed to allow prediction of linear and non-linear fuel properties of user de fined synthetic blend ratios. By integrating an engine performance test fuel scoring system, the model could be used to de fine optimal fuel blends through selection of a desired performance criterion while constraining the optimisation process to adhere to the national legislated gasoline specifications. Four final fuel blends were optimised according to best power output, gravimetric specific fuel consumption, volumetric specific fuel consumption and specific legislated emissions. A fifth blend was optimised for highest power output with no regard for fuel property specifications other than Reid vapour pressure. The performance of the optimised blends was evaluated on the test engine and the results indicated the potential to positively affect the performance characteristics of a synthetic fuel blend for use in a modern spark ignition engine. This study demonstrates a methodology for optimisation of a synthetic fuel to user-selected performance criteria and it is believed that this work represents a novel and valuable contribution to this field...|$|E
