5|$|In 1793, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic went to {{war with}} the French Republic, joining the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars. Despite {{resistance}} from the Dutch Army and a British expeditionary force, the Dutch Republic was overrun by the French {{in the winter of}} 1794–1795, the French reforming the country into the <b>Batavian</b> Republic, a client state of the French regime. Although war between Britain and the <b>Batavian</b> Republic had not been declared, the British government sent instructions on 19 January for <b>Batavian</b> shipping to be seized and, in conjunction with Stadtholder William of Orange, living in exile in London, for <b>Batavian</b> colonies to be neutralised in order to deny their use to the French. On 9 February these orders culminated in the outbreak of war between Britain and the <b>Batavian</b> Republic.|$|E
5|$|In August 1795, the <b>Batavian</b> Navy sent a frigate {{squadron}} {{to operate}} against the British trade routes with Scandinavia, which carried {{large quantities of}} British naval stores to supply the British fleets. These trade routes passed from the Baltic Sea through the Kattegat and Skaggerak channels and across the North Sea, and the <b>Batavian</b> squadron consequently cruised {{at the mouth of}} the Kattegat off the southern coast of neutral Danish controlled Norway. To counteract this <b>Batavian</b> operation, Duncan sent a squadron of British frigates from the North Sea Fleet under the command of Captain James Alms with orders to intercept and destroy the <b>Batavian</b> ships. On 22 August, Alms's force discovered the <b>Batavian</b> squadron close to the Norwegian harbour of Eigerøya. Alms closed with the <b>Batavian</b> force in an attempt to cut it off from land, but was only able to intercept the <b>Batavian</b> frigate Alliante with his ship HMS Stag, compelling the <b>Batavian</b> vessel to surrender in a short engagement. Although the remainder of his squadron exchanged fire with the <b>Batavian</b> ships, damaging the frigate Argo, Alms' force was unable to prevent their escape into Eigerøya.|$|E
50|$|A power vacuum {{occurred}} on the now undefended Rhine border. The <b>Batavians</b> rose and advanced on the empire from the Northeast of Germania Inferior. The majority of the inhabitants of Colonia remained Ubii, as {{they had not been}} fully romanised. They quickly sided with the <b>Batavians.</b> However, when the <b>Batavians</b> demanded that the city wall be torn down, the inhabitants of Colonia again sided with the Roman Empire.|$|R

5|$|The Action of 12 May 1796 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars between a squadron of British Royal Navy frigates and a frigate and four smaller ships of the Navy of the <b>Batavian</b> Republic. The British squadron had been detached on the previous day from the British North Sea fleet under Admiral Adam Duncan, which was cruising off the <b>Batavian</b> fleet anchorage at the Texel, while the <b>Batavian</b> squadron was returning to the Netherlands from the Norwegian coast {{where it had been}} sheltering since suffering defeat at the Action of 22 August 1795 the previous year. As the <b>Batavian</b> squadron neared the <b>Batavian</b> coast, the British squadron under Captain Lawrence Halstead attacked.|$|E
5|$|The {{departure}} of the <b>Batavian</b> squadron was noticed by Donnelly's small blockade force, which shadowed the <b>Batavian</b> ships as they passed southwards down the coast of Jutland, losing sight of them at 22:00 on 11 May. Donnelly correctly guessed the <b>Batavian</b> force's destination, and ordered Sylph to separate, the two vessels following different courses, instructing White to proceed to Duncan's blockade fleet and meet Donnelly there if {{he was unable to}} rediscover the <b>Batavian</b> squadron en route. Pegasus and Sylph encountered one another shortly before 05:00 on 12 May close to Duncan's fleet south of the Texel but without having located the <b>Batavian</b> squadron. Argo and her consorts had sailed close to the Danish and German coasts during the night, seizing in passing a British cutter named Duke of York, travelling from Yarmouth to Hamburg. At dawn on 12 May the <b>Batavian</b> ships were off the <b>Batavian</b> coast sailing southwest towards the Texel anchorage.|$|E
5|$|The last {{survivors}} of the <b>Batavian</b> squadron were harried along the coast by the faster forces in the British fleet with Sylph overhauling the 16-gun Mercury, forcing it to surrender just before 11:00. The <b>Batavian</b> captain had thrown 14 cannon overboard {{in an effort to}} lighten his ship and allow it to escape British pursuit, but without success. Later in the day, Halstead's Phoenix was able to seize the <b>Batavian</b> prize Duke of York, completing the destruction of the entire <b>Batavian</b> squadron.|$|E
50|$|Other Roman {{soldiers}} (like {{those in}} Xanten and the auxiliary troops of <b>Batavians</b> and Cananefates from {{the legions of}} Vitellius) joined the revolt, which split {{the northern part of}} the Roman army. April 70, Vespasianus sent a few legions to stop the revolt. Their commander, Petilius Cerialis, eventually defeated the <b>Batavians</b> and started negotiations with Julius Civilis on his home ground, somewhere between the Waal and the Maas near Noviomagus (Nijmegen) or - as the <b>Batavians</b> probably called it - Batavodurum.|$|R
50|$|By this time, the <b>Batavians</b> were {{independent}} and clearly had the upper hand. Even Vespasian, who was fighting Vitellius for the imperial throne, saluted the rebellion that kept his enemy from calling the Rhine legions to Italy. The <b>Batavians</b> were promised independence and Civilis {{was on his}} way to becoming king.|$|R
50|$|Batavia was {{the name}} used by the Roman Empire for {{the land of the}} <b>Batavians,</b> a Germanic tribe. It was {{described}} as a large island between rivers in the Rhine-Meuse delta. Its modern equivalent is Betuwe. The <b>Batavians</b> shared the island with the Canninefates, to their west near the coast. Their Roman city was Nijmegen.|$|R
5|$|A British {{squadron}} of four frigates {{under the command}} of Captain James Alms was patrolling the entrance to the Skagerrak in August 1795 when three sails were spotted off the Norwegian coast to the north. Closing to investigate, the ships were discovered to be a <b>Batavian</b> {{squadron of}} two frigates and a small cutter. In the face of the larger British squadron the <b>Batavian</b> force turned away, sailing southeast along the Norwegian coast with the British approaching from the south in an effort to cut them off from the neutral Danish shore. At 16:15 the leading British ship HMS Stag caught and engaged the rearmost <b>Batavian</b> ship Alliantie; the remainder of the British squadron continued in pursuit of the <b>Batavian</b> squadron. For an hour Alliantie held out against the more powerful Stag and was eventually compelled to surrender. The remainder of the <b>Batavian</b> squadron escaped due to a fierce rearguard action by the frigate Argo, reaching the safety of the Danish harbour at Eigerøya.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the odds}} against him, the <b>Batavian</b> captain engaged Stag, Yorke laying his ship {{alongside}} Alliantie and the frigates exchanging broadsides for {{an hour before the}} <b>Batavian</b> captain, his situation hopeless and his ship outnumbered and battered, surrendered at 17:15. While Stag and Alliantie fought their duel, the action continued elsewhere, with the remaining <b>Batavian</b> ships making progress eastwards along the Norwegian coastline with the British squadron attempting to cut them off from the channel between Eigerøya and the Norwegian mainland in which the <b>Batavian</b> ships could shelter, protected by Danish neutrality. Vlugheid rapidly outdistanced pursuit, but Argo was slower and came under heavy but distant fire from Reunion and Isis, replying in kind. Argo was subsequently found to have been hit thirty times by 24-pounder shot and had much of its sails and rigging torn away, requiring extensive repairs. Eventually the <b>Batavian</b> persistence paid off, and Vlugheid and Argo successfully escaped into the neutral harbour of Eigerøya before Alms could intercept them.|$|E
5|$|Halstead {{brought his}} prizes back to Britain, where both Argo and Mercury were {{purchased}} for service by the Royal Navy as HMS Janus and HMS Hermes respectively as {{both of the}} <b>Batavian</b> names were already in use by the Royal Navy. British losses in the engagement were one man killed and three wounded, all suffered on Phoenix during the engagement with Argo. Apart from the losses in that exchange, no other casualties, either British or <b>Batavian</b> were reported. The action was the only significant engagement fought off the <b>Batavian</b> coast during 1796 as Duncan's force kept the main <b>Batavian</b> fleet contained within its anchorage in the Texel. In October 1797 however the main <b>Batavian</b> fleet was able to break out and sail on a raiding cruise towards the English coast. Duncan intercepted the fleet on its return to the Texel and inflicted a decisive defeat on the Batavians on 11 October at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Batavians</b> also {{provided}} a contingent for the Emperor's Imperial Horse Guard.|$|R
50|$|In 69, {{the year}} of the four emperors, Emperor Vitellius ordered troops from the Rhine borders redeployed to Italy to support him against the {{rebellion}} of Vespasian which Flaccus refused because he had heard rumors of a possible uprising of the <b>Batavians.</b> When Vittellius ordered forced recruitment of <b>Batavians,</b> they did rise in rebellion against the Romans.|$|R

5|$|The Action of 22 August 1795 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars between a squadron of four British Royal Navy frigates and two frigates and a cutter from the Navy of the <b>Batavian</b> Republic. The engagement was fought off the Norwegian coastal island of Eigerøya, then in Danish Norway, the opposing forces engaged in protecting their respective countries' trade routes to the Baltic Sea. War between Britain and the <b>Batavian</b> Republic began, undeclared, {{in the spring of}} 1795 after the Admiralty ordered British warships to intercept <b>Batavian</b> shipping following the conquest of the Dutch Republic by the French Republic in January 1795.|$|E
5|$|The Scandinavian {{trade routes}} were equally {{important}} for the <b>Batavian</b> Navy, and to protect their merchant shipping from attack by British frigates, the <b>Batavian</b> authorities also sent a frigate squadron to the region, consisting of the 36-gun frigates Alliantie and Argo and the 16-gun cutter Vlugheid. On the afternoon of 22 August 1795 the <b>Batavian</b> force was sailing southeast {{along the coast of}} Norway, then part of Danish Norway, tacking to port towards the land, when the British squadron was spotted approaching from the south.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>Batavian</b> force {{prepared}} to sail, on 16 August Elphinstone's fleet appeared off the bay, {{led by the}} scouting frigate Crescent. He {{sent a letter to}} Lucas demanding his surrender but this was refused. Ascertaining the strength of the <b>Batavian</b> force, on 17 August Elphinstone led his fleet into the bay in line of battle and brought the line to anchor at close gunshot range from Lucas's ships. Trapped between the coast and the British, Lucas immediately raised a flag of truce. He then sent an officer to negotiate terms with Elphinstone. By 17:00, hopelessly outnumbered and his crews in open rebellion, Lucas agreed to terms that dictated an almost unconditional surrender of the <b>Batavian</b> force. Elphinstone furthermore refused Lucas's request for cartels to immediately send his crews back to the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|Equally curtailed by Mucianus were Domitian's {{military}} ambitions. The {{civil war}} of 69 had severely destabilized the provinces, leading to several local uprisings {{such as the}} <b>Batavian</b> revolt in Gaul. <b>Batavian</b> auxiliaries of the Rhine legions, led by Gaius Julius Civilis, had rebelled {{with the aid of}} a faction of Treveri under the command of Julius Classicus. Seven legions were sent from Rome, led by Vespasian's brother-in-law Quintus Petillius Cerialis.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 1796 Elphinstone's larger fleet {{discovered}} Lucas's {{force and}} trapped {{it in the}} bay. Aware that resistance would be futile and with his crews in open revolt, Lucas surrendered unconditionally. The ships of the captured <b>Batavian</b> force were taken into the Royal Navy, joining the squadron at the Cape; Elphinstone was later made Baron Keith in recognition of his achievements. The <b>Batavian</b> operation did however force the cancellation of a planned British invasion of Île de France.

5|$|On hearing Donnelly's report, Duncan {{immediately}} despatched a small squadron to {{the mouth}} of the Texel to wait for the arrival of the <b>Batavian</b> squadron. Command of this squadron was given to Captain Lawrence Halstead in the 36gun frigate HMS Phoenix, accompanied by Pegasus, Sylph and the 50gun fourth rate HMS Leopard. The squadron detached at 05:00 and almost immediately the <b>Batavian</b> squadron was sighted to the southeast, heading for the entrance to the Texel, tacking against the northwest wind. Halstead's force was not unified, with Pegasus and Sylph far ahead of Phoenix and Leopard, and the British commander decided to deliberately detach his forces, the faster Pegasus and Sylph pursuing the brigs under Donnelly's command and Halstead's rear force attacking the frigate Argo. Duncan's main fleet, some distance behind Halstead, also sighted the <b>Batavian</b> squadron and joined the chase.|$|E

5000|$|The second {{reference}} by Pliny to Frisiavones, in paragraph 106, located this {{people in}} the middle of the region which Caesar had described as being inhabited by Belgic Gaulish tribes. Pliny places them in the list between the Sunuci and the Baetasi. Although this particular listing is apparently not made in any exact way, these two tribes were in Germania Inferior which covered the eastern part of modern Belgium, the southeastern Netherlands and the part of Germany which borders them, including Aachen. The northwestern part of this area included the area where the Rhine and Maas converge, and also the [...] "Civitas Batavorum", where the <b>Batavians</b> lived. Edith Wightman proposes that the north of Germania Inferior, near the <b>Batavians,</b> is the most likely place that the Frisiavones lived. She mentions that in one inscription, from Bulla Regia, the Tungri, <b>Batavians</b> and Frisiavones are grouped together. She suggests that the Marsaci and the Sturii could be [...] "pagi" [...] (smaller sub-populations) of either the Frisiavones or the Menapii ...|$|R

5|$|Phoenix {{was joined}} {{soon after the}} {{surrender}} of Argo by the 74gun ship of the line HMS Powerful under Captain William O'Bryen Drury and together the ships took possession of the frigate while the chase of {{the remainder of the}} <b>Batavian</b> squadron continued. At 10:00 two of the brigs turned towards the <b>Batavian</b> coastline to seek shelter and two of the leading British ships, Pegasus and the 50gun HMS Leander under Captain Maurice Delgarno, turned in chase. Donnelly sought to interpose his ships between the brigs and the coast, but found that this would have slowed his vessels so much that the <b>Batavian</b> brigs would have an opportunity to escape. He therefore maintained pursuit and watched the <b>Batavian</b> ships, Gier and Echo driven ashore at the <b>Batavian</b> village of Bosch. Sailing as close to the shore line as safely possible, Delgarno detached cutters to investigate the state of the grounded ships, determining that one had been damaged beyond repair while the other, having initially grounded, had been driven over the shoal into deeper water on the far side. In his report on the action, Duncan considered that a storm which swept the area on the day following the action probably drove the brig back onto the shoal and destroyed it.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Batavian</b> captain, finding {{such a large}} force {{bearing down}} on him, ordered the brigs and cutter to {{separate}} from the frigate, turning with the wind {{in an effort to}} escape with Donnelly close behind. He also turned Argo away from the pursuing Phoenix, but was unable to decide whether to fight or flee and as a result changed course a number of times. This inevitably slowed his ship, and at 08:15 Phoenix was able to come alongside with the advantage of the weather gage. Halstead fired a shot across the <b>Batavian</b> ship's bow as a warning to surrender to such overwhelming odds, but the <b>Batavian</b> captain refused and opened fire on the British frigate. Although Argo made strenuous efforts to escape during the exchange of fire, Halstead's ship was both more accurate and effective, mounting 36 18-pounder cannon and 8 32-pounder carronades to the <b>Batavian</b> frigate's 12-pounder main battery supplemented with a number of cannon of lower calibres. In just 20 minutes, Phoenix had torn much of Argos rigging, sails and masts and inflicted heavy casualties of eight killed and 28 wounded. With his ship damaged, Duncan's fleet in sight and Leopard not far behind Phoenix, the <b>Batavian</b> captain surrendered at 08:35, allowing Halstead to take possession of his vessel.|$|E
