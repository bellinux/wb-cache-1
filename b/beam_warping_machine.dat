40|$|Seersucker is a {{thin and}} {{puckered}} fabric used to make clothing for spring. Due to its specific structure, this fabric is held away from the skin when worn, facilitating heat dissipation and air circulation. Seersucker is produced by slack tension weaving using two <b>warp</b> <b>beams.</b> Due {{to the use of}} two beams, such fabrics were not possible to weave on conventional (with single <b>warp</b> <b>beam)</b> weaving <b>machines.</b> Additional twin beams arrangement was required for such weaving. The objective of the current study is to produce seersucker fabric on conventional looms using a single <b>warp</b> <b>beam.</b> For achieving this objective, two types of weft yarn: 100 % cotton yarns and blended yarns of cotton and elastane (95. 67 % cotton and 4. 33 % Lycra) are used in groups. The viscoelastic behaviour of the produced fabric samples is tested using ASTM standard D 3107 - 07. Instant deformation, elastic recovery, creep and relaxation were recorded and plotted as function of Lycra % age...|$|R

40|$|Yarns of <b>warp</b> <b>beams</b> to knit on <b>warp</b> {{knitting}} <b>machines</b> {{need to be}} wound at equal tensions. The tension variations lead {{to produce}} valleys and ridges of warp yarns on the beam and hence different lengths of individual warp yarns. These length variations lead to loop length variations in warp knitted fabrics and may cause defects along the wales. This research aimed at investigating the warp length variations caused by tension variations {{and its effect on}} the quality of the fabrics knitted. Tension variations of individual warp yarns on <b>warp</b> <b>beams</b> for <b>warp</b> knitting were examined. 16 % of warp yarns were outside the permissible tension range in practical environment. The length measurements of 1128 individual yarns of a <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> show that 0 - 1. 7 % length variations exist among the yarns. The fabrics knitted at different tension values ranging from 4 cN to 20 cN show 6. 6 % increase in wale density. Although the fabric weight variation is below 5 %, the microscopic view of the fabrics shows significant change in the size of loops and rupture of filaments. This has caused visual colour difference in the fabric...|$|R

The analysis refers to simply or multiply connected plates with an isotropic elastic stiffness proportional to the <b>beams</b> <b>warping</b> function. The result extends the one provided by the author for the special case of simple torsion (Barretta, Acta Mech 224 (12) : 2955 - 2964, 2013).

Independent weavers on the other hand must purchase yarn from the mills and warp it themselves, often to their own design. The independent weaver then sends their woven cloth to the mill for finishing and stamping (which they pay for as a service) before it is returned to the weaver to sell for themselves.
