25|$|The United States {{needed to}} find a vehicle to {{continue}} to contain Saddam because the CIA said {{all we have to}} do is wait six months and Saddam is going to collapse on his own volition. That vehicle is sanctions. They needed a justification; the justification was disarmament. They drafted a Chapter 7 resolution of the United Nations Security Council calling for the disarmament of Iraq and saying in Paragraph 14 that if Iraq complies, sanctions will be lifted. Within months of this resolution being passed—and the United States drafted and voted in favor of this resolution—within months, the President, George Herbert Walker <b>Bush,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> Secretary of State, James Baker, are saying publicly, not privately, publicly that even if Iraq complies with its obligation to disarm, economic sanctions will be maintained until which time Saddam Hussein is removed from power.|$|E

25|$|According to Juan Cole, three Iraqi clerics all {{employed}} {{their influence}} and authority among the Shiite {{rank and file}} to make the Samarra bombing work for them politically. Sistani expanded his militia and stayed {{at the forefront of}} the movement by encouraging peaceful rallies. Abdul Aziz al-Hakim used the explosion in Samarra to bolster his own authority. He remonstrated with the American ambassador, saying it was not reasonable to expect the religious Shiites, who won the largest bloc of seats in parliament, to give up their claim on the ministry of interior, and that, indeed, Khalilzad had helped provoke the troubles with his assertions to that effect earlier. Muqtada al-Sadr used the incident to push for a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq, something he has wanted since the fall of Saddam. Abroad, Supreme Jurisprudent Khamenei blamed <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> Israeli allies, an allegation widely believed to be true in Iraq.|$|E
