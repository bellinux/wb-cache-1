5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> {{for treating}} vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, {{with a single}} dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also <b>be</b> <b>helpful.</b> However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|A related {{argument}} against evolution {{is that most}} mutations are harmful.

5|$|Formal {{criteria}} {{exist for}} each of the main subtypes of Guillain–Barré syndrome (AIDP and AMAN/AMSAN, see below), but these may misclassify some cases (particularly where there is reversible conduction failure) and therefore changes to these criteria have been proposed. Sometimes, repeated testing may <b>be</b> <b>helpful.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may <b>be</b> <b>helpful,</b> and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, {{evidence}} of the earliest known life on land on Earth may {{have been found in}} 3.48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. These findings may <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> in deciding where best to search for early signs of life on the planet Mars.|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{is useful}} in the {{treatment}} of bipolar disorder. Lithium salts may also <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> for related diagnoses, such as schizoaffective disorder and cyclic major depression. The active part of these salts is the lithium ion Li+. They may increase the risk of developing Ebstein's cardiac anomaly in infants born to women who take lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy.|$|E

5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment {{generated by the}} front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes a moment to the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and so can <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> in motorcycle racing.

5|$|Hematinic {{deficiencies}} (vitamin B12, {{folic acid}} and iron), occurring singly or in combination, and {{with or without}} any underlying gastrointestinal disease, may be twice as common in people with RAS. However, iron and vitamin supplements only infrequently improve the ulceration. The relationship to vitamin B12 deficiency {{has been the subject}} of many studies. Although these studies found that 0–42% of those with recurrent ulcers suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency, an association with deficiency is rare. Even in the absence of deficiency, vitamin B12 supplementation may <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> due to unclear mechanisms. Hematinic deficiencies can cause anemia, which is also associated with aphthous-like ulceration.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} temples within Phlan, each {{dedicated}} to different gods. Each temple can heal {{those who are}} wounded, poisoned, or afflicted, and can fully restore deceased comrades for a high price. The party can also visit the hiring hall and hire an experienced NPC adventurer to accompany the party. Encounters with NPCs in shops and taverns offer valuable information. Listening to gossip in taverns can <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> to characters, although some tavern tales are false and lead characters into great danger.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} {{typically}} treated with dietary changes and medication. Dietary changes involve eating a low copper diet and not using copper cookware. Medications used include chelating agents such as trientine and d-penicillamine and zinc supplements. Complications of Wilson's disease can include liver failure, liver cancer, and kidney problems. A liver transplant may <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> in those in whom other treatments are not effective or if liver failure occurs.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} tests {{conducted}} by the PSB Corporation and SGS Testing & Control Services found the spring water contains 420mg of chloride per litre, an amount which is substantially higher than the 35 to 100mg in the water from Choa Chu Kang and Bedok waterworks. It was {{also found that the}} sulphide content is three times more than tap water and the spring water is also slightly alkaline due to the presence of minerals. Natural spring waters may have health benefits, similar to the hot springs of other countries near tectonic plates with volcanoes, in a search for cures for some skin conditions, as well as debilitating ailments like rheumatism and arthritis. Although local rheumatologists conceded that hydrotherapy is an accepted treatment that can <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> for mild forms of rheumatism or muscle strain, they, along with dermatologists, remain skeptical of claims about the alternative healing of the natural spring water.|$|E

5|$|Another area of {{interest}} is in assessing whether keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) {{would be better than}} Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of recovery time. Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success of outcomes after surgery has led to a number of trials that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy before surgery. This had previously not been found to <b>be</b> <b>helpful,</b> but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of post-operative therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.|$|E
5|$|Between 1868 and 1877, Carte {{wrote and}} {{published}} {{the music for}} a number of his own songs and instrumental works, as well as several comic operas: Doctor Ambrosias – His Secret, at St. George's Hall (1868); Marie, with librettist E. Spencer Mott, at London's Opera Comique in 1871; and Happy Hampstead, with librettist Frank Desprez, which debuted on an 1876 provincial tour and then played at the Royalty Theatre in 1877. On tour in 1871, Carte conducted Cox and Box by composer Arthur Sullivan and dramatist F. C. Burnand, in tandem with English adaptations of two Offenbach pieces, called Rose of Auvergne and Breaking the Spell, in which Carte's client Selina Dolaro appeared. Carte's musical talent would <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> later in his career, as he was able to audition singers himself from the pianoforte.|$|E
5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation {{about the effects}} of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality {{is one of the most}} often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information.|$|E
