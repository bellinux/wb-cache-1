40|$|ABSTRACT: A high {{efficiency}} design was explored for meso-scale magnetorheological (MR) valves (< 25 mm OD with an annular gap < 1 mm). The {{objective of this}} paper is to miniaturize the MR valve while maintaining the maximum performance of the MR effect in the valve. The main design issues in the MR valve involve the magnetic circuit and nonlinear fluid mechanics. The performance of the MR valve is limited by saturation phenomenon in the magnetic circuit and by the finite yield stress of the MR fluid. When field is applied to the magnetic circuit in the MR valve, a semisolid plug (as a result of particle chain formation) forms perpendicular to the flow direction through the valve, and a finite yield stress is developed as a function of field. The resulting plug thickness is used to control flow rate through, and pressure drop across, the MR valve. The nondimensional plug thickness is evaluated as a basis for evaluating valve efficiency. Design parameters of the MR valve are studied and an optimal performance was designed using steel (Permalloy) material in the magnetic circuit. A maximum magnetic flux density at the gap was achieved in the optimized valve design based on a constraint on the outer diameter limitation. Valve performance was verified with simulation. A flow mode <b>bypass</b> <b>damper</b> system was fabricated and was used to experimentally validate valve performance. Key Words: Author please supply Keywords??...|$|E
40|$|A {{run-around}} {{membrane energy}} exchanger (RAMEE) {{is a novel}} energy exchanger {{that is capable of}} transferring both heat and moisture, which can significantly reduce the energy required to condition outdoor ventilation air. The RAMEE uses a liquid desiccant to transfer both heat and moisture between two remote air streams, making it appropriate for many applications, including building HVAC retro-fits. Both initial system start-up and changing outdoor conditions require time for the desiccant to undergo changes in both temperature and concentration, and can cause significant transient delays in system performance. Under some conditions, these transients may be beneficial by increasing the system performance. However under some conditions, the transient delays can cause a substantial decrease in performance. This thesis focuses on the development of control strategies {{that can be used to}} reduce unwanted transient delays. In order to develop these control strategies, the performance of a RAMEE is first investigated using both experimental and numerical methods. The transient numerical and experimental effectiveness results show satisfactory agreement, with a maximum root mean squared error of 10 %. Both the numerical and experimental data show that a long transient time of several hours, or even several days, can occur upon initial system start-up. The numerical model is used to investigate several control strategies to reduce unwanted transient delays. The control strategies investigated are: solution and air flow control, air flow bypass, solution temperature control, and solution concentration control. The solution and air flow control are shown to reduced the start-up transient time by up to 11 %, but require either a reduction in air flow or an increase in solution pumping costs. Air flow bypass proves to be a better option which provides a 16 % reduction in transient time, and only requires that a <b>bypass</b> <b>damper</b> be provided for each exchanger. Solution temperature control is capable of essentially eliminating the thermal transient time (time required for the solution to reach operating temperature), but the thermal transient time is found to be a minor contributor to the overall transient time (time required for the solution to reach operating temperature and concentration) when the initial concentration of the solution is different than the steady-state concentration. When thermal and moisture transients exist, total transient times may be over 18 days. A practical temperature and concentration control strategy is developed, which can reduce transient delays by over 90 % and increase performance during variable outdoor weather conditions...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, a {{semi-active}} {{static output}} feedback variable structure control (VSC) strategy {{is presented to}} control a two-stage electrorheological (ER) floating raft isolation system. A continuous semi-active static output feedback VSC controller is designed and a <b>bypass</b> ER <b>damper</b> is applied to achieve the best control effect more rapidly and accurately. The sliding surface parameters are determined {{in terms of the}} Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion. The optimal vibration attenuation of the intermediate mass is guaranteed due to the control rule that damping force only dissipates the vibration energy of the intermediate mass. The robustness of the control method with respect to parameter variations and the effectiveness of vibration isolation are demonstrated by numerical simulation results. It shows that the designed semi-active static output feedback VSC strategy realized by the ER damper can achieve better performance than that of optimally passive damping even if system parameter uncertainties exist. In addition, the experiment was carried out to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the presented control scheme in this study. The experimental results are satisfied.

40|$|Existing {{hydraulic}} dampers are passive devices, {{and their}} damping characteristics cannot {{be adapted to}} the varying damping needs of each different flight condition of a rotorcraft. Therefore, dampers and their interfaces to the rotor system are constantly subjected to large damping forces, which contribute to their damage and wear. In this work, we consider the possible use of a bypass valve {{as a means to}} reduce loads while still providing the required amount of damping for safe flight. Two different policies {{for the use of the}} bypass are considered: In the first and simplest of the two, the valve is opened of a constant amount, which varies only as a function of the vehicle flight speed, whereas in the second the valve aperture is modulated as a function of blade azimuth using a higher harmonic feedback law. The investigation on the load-reduction capabilities of the <b>bypass</b> augmented <b>damper</b> is conducted by using validated mathematical models of the A 109 E Power helicopter and of its damper. It is found that both policies are capable of delivering the required level of damping at substantially reduced loads, which for the speed-scheduled aperture drop at values that range between 30 % and 60 %, depending on the flight condition, of the loads generated by the standard passive device, and for the higher harmonic modulated law at values around 20 %– 25 %...|$|R
40|$|The two experiments, BaBar (PEP-II) and E- 158, require quite {{different}} beams in the linac at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, SLAC. The first needs damped beams from the damping rings and low energies at the extraction points {{from the main}} linac. For E- 158, an undamped, polarized beam <b>bypasses</b> the <b>damping</b> rings, and gets accelerated to energies of 45. 6 and 48. 7 GeV with 14 % or 8 % beam loading, resulting in beam charges of 6. 5 · 1011 and 4. 0 · 1011 particles. The linac betatron lattice must accommodate energy differences of up to 50 %, 9 to 14 GeV at the one-third point in the linac. Gradually decreasing cell phase advance from about 100 degrees to 60 degrees near the PEP-II extraction points in the linac reduces the chromatic betatron mismatch of the PEP-II beams to an acceptable level. Additionally, pulsed correctors for steering and a pulsed RF phase shifter were installed to have more independent control for the different beams. Two new feedback systems have been implemented, which (a) stabilize the trajectory {{at the end of}} the linac, and (b) dithers the pulsed RF phase shifter to stabilize the beam phase with respect to the accelerator RF crest. A reduced intensity jitter from the gun and a skew quadrupole after the linac, which mixes the blown-up, stable x-emittance with the varying y-spot also stabilized the beam conditions on the fixed target. ...|$|R
