5|$|Gas Powered Games {{was founded}} in May 1998 by Chris Taylor, then known for the 1997 {{real-time}} strategy game Total Annihilation. Joined by several of his coworkers from Cavedog Entertainment, Taylor {{wanted to create a}} different type of game than before, and after trying several concepts the team decided to make an action role-playing game as their first title. As well as helping create the initial concept, Taylor served as one of the designers for the game, joined by Jacob McMahon as the game's other lead designer and producer and Neal Hallford as the game's lead story and dialogue writer. Hallford was brought onto the project after it had already started; Taylor had devised the start and end of the game but left the intervening details and <b>background</b> <b>story</b> to him. The game's music was composed by Jeremy Soule, who had also worked on Total Annihilation. The development team included around thirty people during development, with changes over time, and reached forty at the project's conclusion.
