5000|$|Geologically speaking, New Mills {{lies in the}} north-south-orientated {{syncline}} {{known as}} the Goyt Trough. The base rocks are from the Carboniferous period, with underlying Namurian gritstone sandstones, from 333 M a.to 313 M a. Above there are coal measures present (Langsettian from 312 M a.). This was folded in the Variscan orogeny into the Goyt Trough syncline. Coal has been mined at over 30 locations in the area, including Pingot Pit. There are three narrow seams of coal present: the Red Ash, Little Mine and the Yard Seam. The Yard Coal is so named {{because that is the}} average thickness of the seam; it is the lowest seam and rests on Woodhead Hill Sandstone. In these seams lead ore has also been extracted. Beardmoor Colliery, Ollersett or <b>Burnt</b> <b>Edge</b> Colliery and Lee or New Mills Colliery all worked the [...] seam. [...] of coal weighs about half an imperial ton, and the Yard Seam would produce 4500 tons per acre. Bigrave Edge or Broadmoor Edge Colliery worked the Red Ash seam, which was only [...] thick.|$|E
40|$|New {{expressions}} for {{the mass}} burning rate are derived from a recently introduced flamelet model using Integral Analysis and results are compared with well-known expressions, based on Large Activation Energy Asymptotics. There is no restriction on Lewis numbers and the expressions reduce to the same results as found earlier with asymptotic techniques if Lewis numbers are close to 1. From our analysis {{it appears that the}} <b>burnt</b> <b>edge</b> of a stretched flamelet is most appropriate to determine the mass burning rate. The consequences for experimental and numerical studies are investigated...|$|E
40|$|Calcium is a {{delicate}} mineral in the plant. A deficiency can cause problems such as blossom end rot in sweet peppers and tomato, <b>burnt</b> <b>edges</b> in leafy crops and ‘tip burn’ in some ornamental crops. The other way round, excess leads to gold spot on tomatoes and stip (colour spotting) in peppers. Just {{paying attention to the}} nutrition is not enough. The distribution in the plant is crucial. This can be regulated but it requires a lot of diligence...|$|R

50|$|Kassandra (Kesendire) {{was one of}} {{the places}} that rebelled against the Ottomans in 1821. Because it managed to stop the Turkish army from {{fighting}} the south Greece rebels it was <b>burnt</b> from <b>edge</b> to edge. The refugees moved with fishing boats to the islands of Skiathos, Skopelos, Alonissos and Evoia. Nobody lived in the peninsula for more than 30 years. Then the population started to gather again. In 1912 it became a part of Greece.|$|R
5000|$|Duccio’s Madonna and Child, or Stoclet Madonna, {{has only}} been widely {{acknowledged}} as Duccio’s work for the past century, and accessible to scholars for only half a century. [...] Comparing the compact size of this work of 11X8 1/8 in. to larger, more illustrious altarpieces and large scale frescoes, the Madonna and Child is understood to be an intimate, devotional image. Some evocations of this understanding come from the <b>burnt</b> <b>edges</b> {{on the bottom of}} the original engaged frame caused by burning candles that likely would have sat just beneath. [...] Looking past the abrupt simplicity of the image, one can begin to understand the changes Duccio was applying to the depiction of religious figures in painting during the early 14th century. Duccio followed other innovative Italian artists of the time like Giotto, both of whom strove to move beyond the purely iconic Byzantine canon and attempted to create a more tangible connection between the viewer and the objects in the painting. For example, the parapet that sits at the bottom of the painting works as a visual enticement for the viewer to look past and into the moment that is captured between the Virgin and Christ Child. At the same time, the parapet also acts as a barrier between the vernacular world and the sacred.|$|R

60|$|From Gloucestershire Bert went northward to the British aeronautic park outside Birmingham, in {{the hope}} that he might be taken on and given food, for there the Government, or at any rate the War Office, still existed as an {{energetic}} fact, concentrated amidst collapse and social disaster upon the effort to keep the British flag still flying in the air, and trying to brisk up mayor and mayor and magistrate and magistrate in a new effort of organisation. They had brought together all the best of the surviving artisans from that region, they had provisioned the park for a siege, and they were urgently building a larger type of Butteridge machine. Bert could get no footing at this work: he was not sufficiently skilled, and he had drifted to Oxford when the great fight occurred in which these works were finally wrecked. He saw something, but not very much, of the battle from a place called Boar Hill. He saw the Asiatic squadron coming up across the hills to the south-west, and he saw one of their airships circling southward again chased by two aeroplanes, the one that was ultimately overtaken, wrecked and <b>burnt</b> at <b>Edge</b> Hill. But he never learnt the issue of the combat as a whole.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} random dynamics on {{the edges}} of a uniform Cayley tree with n vertices, in which edges are either flammable, fireproof, or <b>burnt.</b> Every flammable <b>edge</b> is replaced by a fireproof edge at unit rate, while fires start at smaller rate n(-alpha) on each flammable edge, then propagate through the neighboring flammable edges and are only stopped at fireproof edges. A vertex is called fireproof when all its adjacent edges are fireproof. We show that as n -> infinity, the terminal density of fireproof vertices converges to I when alpha > 1 / 2, to 0 when alpha < 1 / 2, and to some non-degenerate random variable when alpha = 1 / 2. We further study the connectivity of the fireproof forest, in particular the existence of a giant component...|$|R
25|$|His major prose {{work was}} The History of King Richard the Third, which he {{completed}} in 1619 {{and left in}} rough draft at his death, and which, in 1731, was <b>burnt</b> around the <b>edges</b> in the Cotton library fire. Before that, the work had suffered more serious damage, coming {{into the hands of}} Buck's great-nephew, George Buck, who used it as he did others of Buck's works: he produced manuscript copies that he dedicated to various patrons from whom he sought advancement, passing them off as his own. Gradually he altered the History, cutting it, making it look like something written in his own time, rather than earlier, by deleting names of Buck’s learned contemporaries who had shared sources and viva voce information with him, and altering or deleting documentation of sources, with the details of which, also, his copyist was careless. Finally in 1646 he published a version of the History that was slightly over half the length of the original. A second issue (usually referred to erroneously as a second edition) appeared the next year, leading to the assumption that Buck invented many of his sources. This damaged Buck's scholarly reputation for centuries. The authentic text of Buck's History was not published until 1979; the editor, Arthur Kincaid, was able to find all but seven of the hundreds of sources that Buck had meticulously documented.|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{numerical modelling}} study {{was carried out}} to represent geotechnical aspects of the Wieczorek underground coal gasification (UCG) site in Poland. A coupled thermos-mechanical numerical model was created to represent a single coal burning panel. The coal burning proceb was simulated by modifying the energy balance equation with an additional term related to the calorific value of coal as a source. Temperature dependent material properties were abigned to the coupled thermal-mechanical model according to published data. In the model, the burning zone spread about 7. 5 m laterally after 20 days of burning. Results from the coupled model were used to gauge a worst-case scenario {{in terms of the}} potential size of a formed cavity. This data was used within a leb computationally expensive mechanicalonly numerical model in order to evaluate the ground subsidence caused by the worst-case scenario for single and multiple UCG burning panels. The single panel burning resulted in 23 mm of ground subsidence {{at the top of the}} model after long term coal burning. The ground subsidence measured at the top of the model, at the center point of the gasification arrangement, was approximately 72 mm when five panels were <b>burnt</b> with an <b>edge</b> to edge panel distance of 5 m; this was increased to 85 mm for seven panels. The numerical modelling results have implications to the industrial application of UCG...|$|R

6000|$|Having {{given us}} one glance {{out of the}} {{watching}} corner of his eye, and having given his nose one triumphant rub with his forefinger, Mr. Bucket stood with his eyes fastened on his confidential friend and his hand stretched forth {{ready to take the}} paper and present it to my guardian. It was not produced without much reluctance and many declarations on the part of Mr. Smallweed that he was a poor industrious man and that he left it to Mr. Jarndyce's honour not to let him lose by his honesty. Little by little he very slowly took from a breast-pocket a stained, discoloured paper which was much singed upon the outside and a little <b>burnt</b> at the <b>edges,</b> as if it had long ago been thrown upon a fire and hastily snatched off again. Mr. Bucket lost no time in transferring this paper, with the dexterity of a conjuror, from Mr. Smallweed to Mr. Jarndyce. As he gave it to my guardian, he whispered behind his fingers, [...] "Hadn't settled how to make their market of it. Quarrelled and hinted about it. I laid out twenty pound upon it. First the avaricious grandchildren split upon him on account of their objections to his living so unreasonably long, and then they split on one another. Lord!
