5|$|One {{issue that}} has often raised {{concerns}} {{is the use of}} cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains. It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as <b>buffer</b> <b>layer</b> for certain CIGS cells in the form of CdS. The amount of cadmium used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 microgram/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and natural gas 0.2 microgram/kWh.|$|E
25|$|Reported {{global warming}} {{potential}} impacts of CIGS range from 20.5 – 58.8 grams CO2-eq/kWh of electricity generated for different solar irradiation (1,700 to 2,200 kWh/m2/y) and power conversion efficiency (7.8 – 9.12%). EPBT ranges from 0.2 to 1.4 years, while harmonized value of EPBT was found 1.393 years. Toxicity is an issue within the <b>buffer</b> <b>layer</b> of CIGS modules because it contains cadmium and gallium. CIS modules do not contain any heavy metals.|$|E
25|$|In {{practical}} fibers, the cladding {{is usually}} {{coated with a}} tough resin coating and an additional <b>buffer</b> <b>layer,</b> which may be further surrounded by a jacket layer, usually plastic. These layers add strength to the fiber but do not contribute to its optical wave guide properties. Rigid fiber assemblies sometimes put light-absorbing ("dark") glass between the fibers, to prevent light that leaks out of one fiber from entering another. This reduces cross-talk between the fibers, or reduces flare in fiber bundle imaging applications.|$|E

40|$|We report {{broadband}} {{ferromagnetic resonance}} (FMR) measurements {{based on a}} coplanar waveguide (CPW) of ultrathin magnetic film structures that comprise in-plane/out-of-plane decoupled layers deposited on nonmagnetic <b>buffer</b> <b>layers</b> of various thickness or other buffer structures with a diverse sheet resistance. We show that the excitation of the fundamental mode can be substantially (up to 10 times) enhanced in the structures deposited on <b>buffer</b> <b>layers</b> with a low sheet resistance {{in comparison to the}} structures deposited on thin or weakly conducting <b>buffer</b> <b>layers.</b> The results are analyzed in terms of shielding of the electromagnetic field of CPW by the conducting <b>buffer</b> <b>layers.</b> The effect of enhancement of FMR absorption can be attractive for applications in spintronic devices that utilize magnetization dynamics of ultrathin ferromagnetic layers...|$|R
25|$|Cadmium {{telluride}} (CdTe) {{is one of}} {{the fastest-growing}} thin film based solar cells which are collectively known as second generation devices. This new thin film device also shares similar performance restrictions (Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit) as conventional Si devices but promises to lower the cost of each device by both reducing material and energy consumption during manufacturing. Today the global market share of CdTe is 5.4%, up from 4.7% in 2008. This technology’s highest power conversion efficiency is 21%. The cell structure includes glass substrate (around 2mm), transparent conductor layer, CdS <b>buffer</b> <b>layer</b> (50–150nm), CdTe absorber and a metal contact layer.|$|E
25|$|The {{crystallinity}} of the produced tungsten layers can {{be controlled}} by altering the WF6/H2 ratio and the substrate temperature: low ratios and temperatures result in (100) oriented tungsten crystallites whereas higher values favor the (111) orientation. Formation of HF is a drawback, as the HF vapor is very aggressive and etches away most materials. Also, the deposited tungsten shows poor adhesion to the silicon dioxide which the main passivation material in semiconductor electronics. Therefore, SiO2 has to be covered with an extra <b>buffer</b> <b>layer</b> prior to the tungsten deposition. On the other hand, etching by HF may be beneficial to remove unwanted impurity layers.|$|E
25|$|The most {{promising}} method developed to utilize this material involves deposition of YBCO on flexible metal tapes coated with buffering metal oxides. This {{is known as}} coated conductor. Texture (crystal plane alignment) can be introduced into the metal tape itself (the RABiTS process) or a textured ceramic <b>buffer</b> <b>layer</b> can be deposited, {{with the aid of}} an ion beam, on an untextured alloy substrate (the IBAD process). Subsequent oxide layers prevent diffusion of the metal from the tape into the superconductor while transferring the template for texturing the superconducting layer. Novel variants on CVD, PVD, and solution deposition techniques are used to produce long lengths of the final YBCO layer at high rates. Companies pursuing these processes include American Superconductor, Superpower (a division of Furukawa Electric), Sumitomo, Fujikura, Nexans Superconductors, and European Advanced Superconductors. A much larger number of research institutes have also produced YBCO tape by these methods.|$|E

The {{effects on the}} orientation and microstructure of La 2 Zr 2 O 7 <b>buffer</b> <b>layers,</b> including seed layer, thickness and solution concentration, were investigated. The results showed that insertion of a seed layer could obviously improve the crystallization and orientation, and decrease of single layer thickness could also obviously improve the in-plane orientation. The results of all metalorganic depositions derived YBCO/CeO 2 /La 2 Zr 2 O 7 /NiW showed that the prepared La 2 Zr 2 O 7 <b>buffer</b> <b>layers</b> were suitable for coated conductors using all metalorganic depositions...|$|R
30|$|Of particular, {{it should}} be noted that the buffer stacks play a key role in YBCO-coated conductors. The purpose of <b>buffer</b> <b>layers</b> is to prevent counter-diffusion of metal atoms in {{substrate}} and oxygen atoms in YBCO. In addition, <b>buffer</b> <b>layers</b> provide with a continuous, smooth, chemical inert surface and good match for the growth of YBCO films. Therefore, the <b>buffer</b> <b>layers</b> must to be epitaxially grown on the RABiTS substrates, and the lattice parameters of <b>buffer</b> <b>layers</b> should have a small mismatch with the substrate. Many oxide materials, such as Y 2 O 3 [21], CeO 2 [22], SrTiO 3 [23], and La 2 Zr 2 O 7 [24], have been successfully attempted. Among them, the multi-layer architecture CeO 2 /YSZ/Y 2 O 3 is most widely used.|$|R

25|$|Tristructural-isotropic (TRISO) fuel {{is a type}} of micro fuel particle. It {{consists}} of a fuel kernel composed of UOX (sometimes UC or UCO) in the center, coated with four layers of three isotropic materials. The four layers are a porous <b>buffer</b> <b>layer</b> made of carbon, followed by a dense inner layer of pyrolytic carbon (PyC), followed by a ceramic layer of SiC to retain fission products at elevated temperatures and to give the TRISO particle more structural integrity, followed by a dense outer layer of PyC. TRISO fuel particles are designed not to crack due to the stresses from processes (such as differential thermal expansion or fission gas pressure) at temperatures up to and beyond 1600°C, and therefore can contain the fuel in the worst of accident scenarios in a properly designed reactor. Two such reactor designs are the pebble-bed reactor (PBR), in which thousands of TRISO fuel particles are dispersed into graphite pebbles, and the prismatic-block gas-cooled reactor (such as the GT-MHR), in which the TRISO fuel particles are fabricated into compacts and placed in a graphite block matrix. Both of these reactor designs are high temperature gas reactors (HTGRs). These are also the basic reactor designs of very-high-temperature reactors (VHTRs), one of the six classes of reactor designs in the Generation IV initiative that is attempting to reach even higher HTGR outlet temperatures.|$|E
