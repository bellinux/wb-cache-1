40|$|Blood {{contamination}} of 16 surfaces in the dental surgery was investigated using the Kastle-Meyer test for haemoglobin, after {{three types of}} periodontal procedures had been performed on a total of 30 patients. The effect of cleaning surfaces contaminated by blood was investigated using the same test. Cleaning materials used in the dental surgery were tested {{to rule out the}} possibility of false positive outcomes and the sensitivity of the test was determined prior to the study. The results show a marked variation in the degree of contamination and efficacy of cleaning following treatment. Overall, root planing was associated with the most widespread and frequent blood contamination and gingival surgery the least. The surgery work surface, edge of the spittoon, aspirator tube and ultrasonic scaler handpiece into which the ultrasonic insert fits, were the most frequently contaminated surfaces. The work surface, dentist’s pen, light switch and handle were cleaned most effectively. The least effectively cleaned surfaces were the water dispenser switch, aspirator tube, <b>bracket</b> <b>table</b> and ultrasonic scaler handpiece. Methods for reducing this potential source of cross-infection are discussed...|$|E

5000|$|These ideas, {{from the}} 1950s and 1960s onwards, have been reconsidered. Brian Vickers {{summed up the}} view a {{generation}} or so later: dismissive of Yates, he notes that <b>bracketed</b> <b>tables</b> existed in older manuscripts, and states that Ong's emphases are found unconvincing. Further, methodus, the Ramists' major slogan, was specific to figures of speech, deriving from Hermogenes of Tarsus via George of Trebizond. And the particular moves used by Ramus in the reconfiguration of rhetoric were in no sense innovative by themselves. Lisa Jardine agrees with Ong {{that he was not}} a first-rank innovator, more of a successful textbook writer adapting earlier insights centred on topics-logic, but insists on his importance and influence in humanistic logic. She takes the Ramean tree to be a [...] "voguish" [...] pedagogic advance.|$|R

40|$|Digital {{radiography}} is a invaluable {{technique to}} get information concerning the conservation state of a painting, while it offers qualitative data about {{the composition of the}} work of art. On the other hand, K-edge differential radiography maps the distribution of a chosen element in the whole painted surface and can univocally characterize the art work. This technique is subtracting two images obtained by monoenergetic X-rays, bracketing the K-edge of a chemical element. It was initially proposed in the medical field and was successfully applied in angiography and mammography. For the study of paintings, it was formerly applied using X-ray source monochromatized by Bragg diffraction and synchrotron radiation. An alternative method for K-edge RX is filtering a commercial X-ray generator by filters made of adjacent elements in the periodic <b>table,</b> <b>bracketing</b> the absorption edge of the target element. If this method should be effective, it could be easily implemented with any commercial system and applied for in situ applications. First maps of Cadmium in XX century paintings have been obtained filtering by thin slices of Silver (Z = 47), Cadmium (Z = 48) and Indium (Z = 49).

40|$|This master’s thesis {{project is}} the final course of the program Industrial Design Engineering with focus on product {{development}} at Luleå University of Technology (LTU) Luleå, Sweden. This master thesis project was carried out during the autumn of 2014 at the Department of Interior & Support Systems {{as a part of}} the engineering division at BAE System in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. The project was divided into two separate objectives. The first objective with the project was to redesign products with respect to an overall improvement of the products geometry, weight, material, use and accessibility. The second objective was to design a product to explore the possibilities of implementing a lighter material as an alternative to steel. This thesis project focus on products that are a part of, or intended for the infantry combat vehicle called CV 90. The first objective focused on the redesign and optimization of an operator’s table with the incentive to improve the weight, geometry, use- and accessibility of the table construction. The second objective focused on the design of a weapon bracket to implement a new lighter material. The project followed a traditional product development process. A process of literature research of decisive theory concerning methods and approaches, theories and guidance. Literature studies founded the base of this project and were followed by an ideation process, concept development, evaluation of concepts, mock-up manufacturing and evaluation and finally, prototype layout for manufacture. The result of the weapon bracket is presented as a concept prototype to be manufactured in a carbon fiber material. Carbon fiber provides an extremely strong and light material that weighs around 18 % compared to the mock-up, manufactured in steel. The use of carbon fiber resulted in a decreased weight of the bracket from 1. 45 Kg to 0. 26 Kg. The weapon bracket uses a module system that enables a two directional mounting ability of the rifle. The locking mechanism consists of an integrated spring forced bolt that locks and unlocks the rifle when retracted from the <b>bracket.</b> The operators’ <b>table</b> decreased 19. 4 Kg in weight due to the redesign of the rail system and the new geometrical modifications. The height from the floor to the table increased from 500 mm to 570 mm which provided a better situation for the operator’s legs, especially for the operator located on the right side of the table. The new design of the table consisted of one limitation, the ability to retract the table boards separately. The overall design of the table was improved especially with respect to weight and accessibility for the operators’. Validerat; 20150903 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
