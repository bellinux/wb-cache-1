5|$|The {{discovery}} of Sedna with its peculiar orbit in 2004 {{led to the}} conclusion that something beyond the known eight planets had perturbed Sedna away from the Kuiper <b>belt.</b> <b>That</b> object could have been an unknown planet on a distant orbit, a random star that passed near the Solar System, or a member of the Sun's birth cluster. The announcement in March 2014 of the {{discovery of}} a second sednoid, , which shared some orbital characteristics with Sedna and other extreme trans-Neptunian objects, further raised the possibility of an unseen super-Earth in a large orbit.|$|E
5|$|In an {{alternative}} scenario, the exozodiacal dust may be generated in an outer <b>belt</b> <b>that</b> is orbiting between 55 and 90AU from Epsilon Eridani {{and has an}} assumed mass of 10−3 times the mass of Earth. This dust is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between the dust grains are taken into account, the dust will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness. Outside the radius of ice sublimation, located beyond 10AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100K, the best fit to the observations occurs when a mix of ice and silicate dust is assumed. Inside this radius, the dust must consist of silicate grains that lack volatiles.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez takes Bond to his base, {{which is}} {{disguised}} as {{the headquarters of}} a religious cult. Bond learns that Sanchez's scientists can dissolve cocaine in petrol and then sell it disguised as fuel to Asian drug dealers. The televangelist Professor Joe Butcher serves as middleman, working under Sanchez's business manager Truman-Lodge. During Sanchez's presentation to potential Asian customers, Dario discovers Bond and betrays him to Sanchez. Bond starts {{a fire in the}} laboratory, but is captured again and placed on the conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>that</b> drops the brick-cocaine into a giant shredder. Bouvier arrives and shoots Dario, allowing Bond to pull Dario into the shredder, killing him.|$|E

5|$|While {{introduced}} in 2002 {{as a new}} title, the WWE often made allusions to other titles including those of WCW and the NWA, amalgamating {{the history of the}} championship with the history of the <b>belt</b> <b>that</b> represents it. As affirmed by WWE, the World Heavyweight Championship is not a continuation of the WCW Championship, but rather its successor by way of the WWE Undisputed Championship, just as the WCW Championship spun off from the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Due to its relation to both titles, its lineage is connected with the earliest recognized world heavyweight championship. In 2009, WWE released a DVD set called History of the World Heavyweight Championship that definitively linked the title to the WCW and NWA titles.|$|E
5|$|The state's {{conservative}} {{white voters}} began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century. After this period, they supported Republicans for {{local and state}} offices as well, and most whites became Republican Party members. The party also attracted some minorities, but many have continued to vote for Democratic candidates. The shift to the Republican Party is much-attributed {{to the fact that}} the Democratic Party became increasingly liberal during the 20th century, and thus increasingly out-of-touch with the average Texas voter. As Texas was always a conservative state, voters switched to the GOP, which now more closely reflected their beliefs. Commentators have also attributed the shift to Republican political consultant Karl Rove, who managed numerous political campaigns in Texas in the 1980s and 1990s. Other stated reasons included court-ordered redistricting and the demographic shift in relation to the Sun <b>Belt</b> <b>that</b> favored the Republican Party and conservatism.|$|E

5|$|The Antarctic Oscillation, {{also known}} as the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode is the main factor in tropospheric {{circulation}} variability south of 20oS and is characterized by pressure anomalies with one situated in the Antarctic and one situated in a band at around 40–50oS around the globe. It mainly affects middle and high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by the north–south displacement of the westerly wind <b>belt</b> <b>that</b> circle around Antarctica. Such variation in the position of the westerly wind belt affects the intensity and position of cold fronts and mid latitude storm systems and is partly responsible for variation in precipitation in the southern parts of Argentina. The Antarctic Oscillation is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. A positive phase is when the westerly wind belt is displaced to the south. The positive phase occurs when there is increased surface pressure over the southern parts of the South American continent and decreased pressure in Antarctica. This results in stronger westerly winds in the southern parts of the country while preventing cold fronts from penetrating inland, producing more stable conditions. Furthermore, the positive phase leads to warmer conditions south of 40oS, particularly during the summer in areas between 40–60oS. Precipitation is lower due to less frontal and orographic precipitation resulting from reduced westerly wind flow between 40–60OS. Opposite conditions occur in the negative phase when the westerly wind belt is shifted equatorward. Cold fronts moving northwards from the south penetrate more frequently, leading to more precipitation and cooler temperatures during the negative phase. The major effect of negative phase of the Antarctic Oscillation occurs in spring when it increases precipitation over southeastern South America.|$|E

40|$|Many Archean cratons are {{surrounded}} by Proterozoic mobile <b>belts</b> <b>that</b> have experienced episodes of tectonic re-activation over their lifetimes. This suggests <b>that</b> mobile <b>belt</b> lithosphere {{may be associated with}} long lived, inherited weakness. It is proposed that the proximity of this weakness can increase the longevity of deep Archean lithosphere by buffering Archean cratons from mantle derived stresses. The physical plausibility of this idea is explored through numerical simulations of mantle convection that include continents and allow for material rheologies that model the combined brittle and ductile behavior of the lithosphere. Within the simulations, the longevity of deep cratonic lithosphere does increase if it is buffered by mobile <b>belts</b> <b>that</b> can fail at relatively low stress levels...|$|R
