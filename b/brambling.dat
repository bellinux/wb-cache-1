25|$|The {{eggs and}} nestlings of the {{chaffinch}} are predated by crows, red and grey squirrels, domestic cats and probably also by stoats and weasels. Clutches begun {{later in the}} spring suffer less predation, an effect that {{is believed to be}} due to the increased vegetation making nests more difficult to find. Unlike the case for the closely related <b>brambling,</b> the chaffinch is not parasitised by the common cuckoo.|$|E
25|$|The rocks {{around the}} Zugspitze are a habitat for chamois, whilst marmots are {{widespread}} {{on the southern}} side of the massif. At the summit there are frequently alpine choughs, drawn there by people feeding them. Somewhat lower down the mountain there are mountain hare and the hazel dormouse. Alpine birds occurring on the Zugspitze include the golden eagle, rock ptarmigan, snow finch, alpine accentor and <b>brambling.</b> The crag martin which has given {{its name to the}} Schwalbenwand ("Swallows' Wall") at Kreuzeck is frequently encountered. The basins of Mittenwald and Seefeld, as well as the Fern Pass are on bird migration routes.|$|E
25|$|The Fringillidae are all seed-eaters with stout conical bills. They {{have similar}} skull morphologies, nine large primaries, 12 tail {{feathers}} and no crop. In all species, the female builds the nest, incubates the eggs, and broods the young. Finches {{are divided into}} two subfamilies, the Carduelinae, containing around 28 genera with 141 species and the Fringillinae containing a single genus, Fringilla, with three species: the chaffinch (F. coelebs), the Tenerife blue chaffinch (F. teydea), and the <b>brambling</b> (F. montifringilla). Fringilline finches raise their young almost entirely on arthropods, while the cardueline finches raise their young on regurgitated seeds.|$|E

Given an undirected graph, a <b>bramble</b> is a set of connected subgraphs (called <b>bramble</b> elements) such that every pair of subgraphs either contains a common node, or such that an edge (i, j) exists with node i belonging to one subgraph and node j belonging to the other. In this paper we examine the problem of finding the <b>bramble</b> number of a graph, along with a set of <b>bramble</b> elements that yields this number. The <b>bramble</b> number is the largest cardinality of a minimum hitting set over all <b>bramble</b> elements on this graph. A graph with <b>bramble</b> number k has a treewidth of k - 1. We provide a branch-and-price-and-cut method that generates columns corresponding to <b>bramble</b> elements, and rows corresponding to hitting sets.

25|$|Havens {{with the}} {{touching}} definition {{are closely related}} to <b>brambles,</b> families of connected subgraphs of a given graph that all touch each other. The order of a <b>bramble</b> is the minimum number of vertices needed in a set of vertices that hits all of the subgraphs in the family. The set of flaps '(X) for a haven of order k (with the touching definition) forms a <b>bramble</b> of order at least k, because any set Y of fewer than k vertices fails to hit the subgraph '(Y). Conversely, from any <b>bramble</b> of order k, one may construct a haven of the same order, by defining '(X) (for each choice of X) to be the X-flap that includes all of the subgraphs in the <b>bramble</b> that are disjoint fromX. The requirement that the subgraphs in the <b>bramble</b> all touch each other can be used to show that this X-flap exists, and that all of the flaps '(X) chosen in this way touch each other. Thus, a graph has a <b>bramble</b> of order k if and only if it has a haven of orderk.|$|R
