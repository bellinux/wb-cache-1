Adaptive noise canceling (ANC) offers the potential for sidelobe interference cancellation coupled with signal preservation, provided both amplitude and phase information are available.

6000|$|Quitting Portland, it was {{necessary}} to make rather a round turn on leaving the breakwater, as right ahead on the starboard bow was a small light-ship, looking like the skeleton of a vessel, and marking the presence of a dangerous shoal, known by the most appropriate and significant name of [...] "The Shambles." [...] Inside this lay a long and turbid ridge of angry water, where the Race of Portland ran, and where a deep rolling swell, like the Bay of Biscay on a reduced scale, kept tumbling and breaking into spray like drifts of snow against the high, gaunt cliffs. It, however, required no actual watching of the low green mounds of water, which seemed butting against the coast, to convince all on board that the Great Eastern was at sea. To the infinite relief and comfort of all the passengers, the vessel began to yield to reason, and to behave as much like another ship as she could consistently with her size. It would be too much to say she rolled at this time; for when the Great Eastern rolls, if ever she does roll, travellers may depend upon her accomplishing something in that peculiar style of ocean navigation quite in proportion to her bulk; but one thing is certain-- that she went from side to side sufficiently to show that she was susceptible of the motion of the water, and that if ever she steams across a <b>beam</b> <b>sea,</b> she is likely to move to it with a will, though slowly and easily.|$|E

A lamp is lighted in the wheel-house; so one patch of yellow light falls on the green-painted pistons of the steering gear as they snatch up the rudder-chains. A big sea has got home.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} estimating the spectra of water wave disturbances on {{five of the six}} axes of a stationary, slender body underwater vehicle in an inertia dominated wave force regime, both in head <b>seas</b> and in <b>beam</b> <b>seas.</b> Inertia dominated wave forces are typical of those encountered by a 21 inch diameter, torpedo shaped underwater vehicle operating in coastal waters and sea state 2. Strip theory is used to develop transfer function phase and magnitude between surface water waves and the slender body pitch, heave, and surge forces and moment for the vehicle in head seas, and for pitch, heave, yaw, and sway forces and moments in <b>beam</b> <b>seas.</b> Experiments are conducted which verify this method of transfer function calculation, and demonstrate the effects of vehicle forward motion in the head seas case. Using known sea spectra and linear time invariant systems theory allows for estimation of the water wave disturbance spectra for these forces and moments. Application of sliding control techniques are then developed for the underwater vehicle longitudinal plane equations of motion. Computer simulations are used to demonstrate the dependence of underwater vehicle depth control upon the pitch control, and adaptive pitch control is shown to provide good performance in the presence of substantial parametric uncertainty. Pitch disturbance rejection properties of variations of the sliding controller are investigated. Both single frequency and stochastic disturbances are used, and the stochastic disturbance is developed using the results of the earlier investigation. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{stability}} of a ship with stabilizing tanks (U-tanks) in a longitudinal seaway is investigated. The effectiveness of properly adjusted tanks in <b>beam</b> <b>sea</b> is known. Their effect is to split the ordinary resonance peak in two other shifted in frequency.

Here, we extend the analysis by taking into account the very dangerous parametric rolling in a longitudinal sea. To this end, the system of equations describing ship rolling, water motion in the tank and heave motion was considered.

The global motion responses of a modern LNG carrier at forward speed in <b>beam</b> <b>seas</b> are then calculated to investigate the coupling effects between sloshing and seakeeping.

Surveys with many overlapping swaths and digital recording on magnetic tape of <b>Sea</b> <b>Beam</b> 2 ̆ 7 s 16 acoustic returns made it possible to evaluate actual system performance. The artifacts are not due to the contouring algorithm used. Rather, they result from errors in echo detection and processing. These errors are due to internal factors such as side lobe interference, bottom-tracking gate malfunctions, or external interference from other sound sources (e. g., 3. 5 kHz echo sounders or seismic sound sources). Although many artifacts are obviously spurious and would be disregarded, some (particularly the 2 ̆ 2 omega 2 ̆ 2 effects described in this paper) are more subtle and could mislead the unwary observer. Artifacts observed could be mistaken for volcanic constructs, abyssal hill trends, hydrothermal mounds, slump blocks, or channels and could seriously affect volcanic, tectonic, or sedimentological interpretations.
