Their enjoyment is derailed when an evil intergalactic pig-wizard named Wizpig arrives at Timber's Island and attempts to take it over after having conquered his own planet's racetracks. He turns the island's four guardians (Tricky the Triceratops, <b>Bubbler</b> the Octopus, Bluey the Walrus and Smokey the Dragon) into his henchmen. The only solution available to the island's inhabitants is to defeat Wizpig in an elaborate series of races that involve cars, hovercrafts, and aeroplanes. Drumstick the Rooster, the best racer on the island, failed this challenge and was transformed into a frog by Wizpig's black magic.|$|E
25|$|With the {{consistent}} success of Ultimate's releases there were rumours of a buyout by Ocean, {{until it was}} announced in 1985 that the Stamper brothers had sold the Ultimate catalogue and name to U.S. Gold, who would continue to release games under the Ultimate label. Later titles such as Martianoids and <b>Bubbler</b> were not seen by the gaming press as being up to Ultimate's previously high standards and sales fell. U.S. Gold released no new Ultimate games after <b>Bubbler</b> in 1987. A final Sabreman game, Mire Mare, was trailed in earlier Sabreman games and was mentioned by Sinclair User as being next up for release, but was quietly dropped during development. In late 1988 Rare bought back all the rights sold to U.S. Gold and were reported to be developing games again. Future releases were to have included Solar Jetman, which would eventually appear only on the Nintendo Entertainment System, although home computer conversions for the Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga, and Atari ST were completed by Storm Software, but not released.|$|E

Two air <b>bubbler</b> systems were fitted: one in the bow to lubricate the hull and another in the stern to prevent ice from entering the nozzles.

40|$|International audienceThe {{motion and}} {{interactions}} of three equal-interval parallel <b>bubbles</b> in non-Newtonian fluids were numerically simulated by {{volume of fluid}} method (VOF), in which the continuous surface tension model and the power-law model were adopted to represent surface tension and rheological properties of non-Newtonian fluids, respectively. The computational method was validated by the comparison of the processes of coalescence of two in-line <b>bubbles</b> and rising of two parallel <b>bubbles</b> between experiment and simulation. This method was then applied to study the effect of initial <b>bubble</b> diameter, initial horizontal <b>bubble</b> interval and rheological properties of non-Newtonian fluids on lateral coalescence and rising of three parallel <b>bubbles.</b> The dimensionless critical horizontal interval of <b>bubble</b> coalescence was obtained under different physical property conditions. The critical horizontal interval of <b>bubble</b> coalescence decreases {{with the increase of}} initial <b>bubble</b> diameter and flow index of non-Newtonian fluids. When the initial horizontal <b>bubble</b> interval is less than the critical horizontal interval of <b>bubble</b> coalescence, three <b>bubbles</b> will coalesce into a bigger <b>bubble.</b> The coalescing <b>bubble</b> could breakup into two identical daughter <b>bubbles</b> when the initial <b>bubble</b> diameter was increased or the flow index of non-Newtonian fluids was decreased. Three parallel <b>bubbles</b> rising in non-Newtonian fluids will experience repulsive interactions once the initial horizontal <b>bubble</b> interval is greater than the critical horizontal interval of <b>bubble</b> coalescence, the horizontal <b>bubble</b> interval increased gradually owing to the repulsive effect, while the vertical distance between <b>bubbles</b> varied dramatically for spherical <b>bubble</b> and ellipsoidal <b>bubble</b> due to the differences of their flow field structures...|$|R

40|$|The present work is {{concerned}} with direct numerical simulations for the shock-bubble and bubble-bubble interactions using the improved ghost fluid method in which the Riemann solutions are utilized to diminish numerical oscillations near interfaces. The influence of <b>bubble</b> size and bubble-bubble distance on the collapse of in-line two <b>bubbles</b> and in-line three <b>bubbles</b> are investigated to understand {{the conditions under which}} the bubble-bubble interactions accelerate or decelerate the <b>bubble</b> collapse. It is shown that when the in-line <b>bubbles</b> collapse by the incident shock wave, the collapse of the downstream <b>bubble</b> can be accelerated by the shock waves due to the collapse of upstream <b>bubbles,</b> while the collapse of the upstream <b>bubbles</b> is decelerated by the expansion wave cased by the reflection of the incident shock wave at the surface of the downstream <b>bubbles.</b> Also, there exists the bubble-bubble distance in which the collapse of the downstream <b>bubble</b> is most accelerated.
