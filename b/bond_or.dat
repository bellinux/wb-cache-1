25|$|A surety <b>bond</b> <b>or</b> surety is {{a promise}} by a surety or {{guarantor}} to pay one party (the obligee) {{a certain amount}} if a second party (the principal) fails to meet some obligation, such as fulfilling {{the terms of a}} contract. The surety bond protects the obligee against losses resulting from the principal's failure to meet the obligation.|$|E
25|$|Grief is a {{multifaceted}} response to loss, {{particularly to the}} loss of someone or something that has died, to which a <b>bond</b> <b>or</b> affection was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement refers to the state of loss, and grief is the reaction to that loss.|$|E
25|$|A CDS {{contract}} is typically documented under a confirmation referencing the credit derivatives definitions as {{published by the}} International Swaps and Derivatives Association. The confirmation typically specifies a reference entity, a corporation or sovereign that generally, although not always, has debt outstanding, and a reference obligation, usually an unsubordinated corporate <b>bond</b> <b>or</b> government bond. The period over which default protection extends {{is defined by the}} contract effective date and scheduled termination date.|$|E

25|$|A {{chemical}} bond {{can be a}} covalent bond, an ionic bond, a hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>or</b> just because of Van der Waals force. Each {{of these kinds of}} bonds is ascribed to some potential. These potentials create the interactions which hold atoms together in molecules or crystals. In many simple compounds, valence bond theory, the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model (VSEPR), and the concept of oxidation number can be used to explain molecular structure and composition.|$|E
25|$|A fiduciary, {{such as the}} administrator, {{executor}} or {{guardian of}} an estate, may be legally required to file with a probate court or judge a surety bond, called a fiduciary <b>bond</b> <b>or</b> probate bond, to guarantee faithful performance of his duties.

25|$|Social integration: Touch {{is widely}} used for social integration, a use that is typified by the social {{grooming}} of one animal by another. Social grooming has several functions; it removes parasites and debris from the groomed animal, it reaffirms the social <b>bond</b> <b>or</b> hierarchical relationship between the animals, and it gives the groomer an opportunity to examine olfactory cues on the groomed individual, perhaps adding additional ones. This behaviour has been observed in social insects, birds and mammals.|$|E
25|$|In 1862, General Ulysses S. Grant {{appointed}} Stephen A. Hurlbut {{in charge}} of Memphis and the Irving Block prison. Hurlbut had been instructed {{to crack down on}} Confederate sympathizers and the smuggling of cotton, but instead set up an extortion ring to profit from the turmoil in the city. Hurlbut also began extorting money from Memphis merchants, imprisoning them in Irving Block on false charges of espionage and demanding exorbitant bond fees, then never calling the accused to return to court, keeping the <b>bond</b> <b>or</b> sometimes finding them guilty in absentia as an excuse to confiscate the rest of their property.|$|E
25|$|Governments issue {{government}} bonds {{in their own}} currency and sovereign bonds in foreign currencies. State and local governments issue municipal bonds to finance projects or other major spending initiatives. Debt issued by government-backed agencies is called an agency bond. Companies can issue a corporate <b>bond</b> <b>or</b> obtain money from a bank through a corporate loan. Preferred stocks {{share some of the}} characteristics of fixed interest bonds. Securitized bank lending (e.g. credit card debt, car loans or mortgages) can be structured into other types of fixed income products such as ABS – asset-backed securities which can be traded on exchanges just like corporate and {{government bonds}}.|$|E

25|$|Hedge funds using {{a global}} macro {{investing}} strategy take sizable positions in share, <b>bond</b> <b>or</b> currency markets {{in anticipation of}} global macroeconomic events in order to generate a risk-adjusted return. Global macro fund managers use macroeconomic ("big picture") analysis based on global market events and trends to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements. While global macro strategies have {{a large amount of}} flexibility (due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets), the timing of the implementation of the strategies is important in order to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns. Global macro is often categorized as a directional investment strategy.|$|E
25|$|A third wire, {{called the}} <b>bond</b> (<b>or</b> earth) wire, is often {{connected}} between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures {{there is always}} a low electrical impedance path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current {{for as long as it}} takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.|$|E
25|$|Ignis' {{personality}} {{was designed}} to be expressed in both his looks, the way he spoke, and his gestures. His role as the party's cook came about when considering which among them would be most likely to take up that duty. His cooking skills are explained in-game to exchanges with Noctis during their early lives. Out of the main cast, Ignis went through the least changes despite the technological improvements during the shift between Versus XIII and Final Fantasy XV. To reflect his position as Noctis's protector from a young age, he was made to look more toned and his musculature was developed, particularly around the neck. Care was taken to retain his intellectual look. As {{with the rest of the}} party, he is dressed in black due to its specific significance to the Lucian royal family. For Ignis' English version, Inoue wrote him to be a suave and logical character like a younger version of James <b>Bond</b> <b>or</b> Sherlock Holmes.|$|E

25|$|The main number {{which is}} used to assess the value of the bond is the gross {{redemption}} yield. This is defined such that if all future interest and principal repayments are discounted back to the present, at an interest rate equal to the gross redemption yield (gross means pre-tax), then the discounted value is equal to the current market price of the <b>bond</b> (<b>or</b> the initial issue price if the bond is just being launched). Fixed income investments such as bonds and loans are generally priced as a credit spread above a low-risk reference rate, such as LIBOR or U.S. or German Government Bonds of the same duration. For example, if a 30-year mortgage denominated in US dollars has a gross redemption yield of 5% per annum and 30 year US Treasury Bonds have a gross redemption yield of 3% per annum (referred to as the risk free yield), the credit spread is 2% per annum (sometimes quoted as 200 basis points). The credit spread reflects the risk of default. Risk free interest rates are determined by market forces and vary over time, based on a variety of factors, such as current short-term interest rates, e.g. base rates set by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England in the UK, and the Euro Zone ECB. If the coupon on the bond is lower than the yield, then its price will be below the par value, and vice versa.|$|E

[...] In this article, he developed {{the concept of the}} electron-pair bond, in which two atoms may share one to six electrons, thus forming the single electron bond, a single bond, a double <b>bond,</b> <b>or</b> a triple bond.|$|E

On May 10, Fred Shuttlesworth and Martin Luther King Jr. told reporters that they had an agreement from the City of Birmingham to desegregate lunch counters, restrooms, drinking fountains and fitting rooms within 90days, and to hire blacks in stores as salesmen and clerks. Those in jail would be released on <b>bond</b> <b>or</b> their own recognizance.
