5|$|In 1931, Everett H. Kimmell, another U.S. Surveyor, {{found this}} newer stone had broken too and he {{replaced}} it with a brass disc marker set in cement. In 1962, the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian Affairs poured an elevated cement pad around the 1931 brass marker; this pad included the state <b>border</b> <b>lines</b> and names in tile. The monument was completely rebuilt in 1992, and the 1931 brass marker was replaced with a disc shaped aluminum-bronze plate set in granite. The monument was again rebuilt in 2010, although the disc shaped plate from 1992 remained in place.|$|E
5|$|The block {{passed into}} the hands of the Amsterdam printer and {{cartographer}} Willem Janssen (also called Willem Blaeu amongst other names). By this time the block was very damaged; the <b>border</b> <b>lines</b> were chipped, there were numerous woodworm holes and a pronounced crack had developed through the rhino's legs. Janssen decided to re-issue the block with the addition of a new tone block printed in a variety of colours, olive-green and dark green, as well as blue-grey. The resulting chiaroscuro woodcut, which entirely omitted the text, was published after 1620. There is an example in the British Museum. This was the seventh of the eight editions in all of the print.|$|E

The best-trained British light {{infantry}} roamed the jungle, attacking Indonesian bases and patrols at will and trying to {{give the appearance of}} being everywhere at once as a psychological effect upon the enemy. Initially launched only over short distances, seaborne raids into peninsular Malaysia caused the range to be extended throughout 1964 and 1965. Walker continued the Claret raids to great effect until the end of his tenure, as he was replaced by Major General George Lea as commander of British forces in Borneo. Lea, however, had the bad fortune of being ordered to take command just as the conflict began to reach its climax in the spring of 1965. Sukarno, desperate for a decisive victory and apprehensive of the effect that the fruitless conflict was having upon his country, was beginning to order stronger attacks to win a decisive military victory and drive the British from the <b>border</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Northern {{border of}} Macedonia {{has always been}} important, {{according}} to its relevance in defining borders with Northern neighbors: Republic of Serbia and Kosovo and Metohija. Several key elements have been defining the <b>border</b> <b>line</b> between Macedonia and Northern neighbors. The first factor is the difficulty which comes {{with the problem of}} defining the national system of people who live near the border itself and according to which the border had been and is defined. So, according to this factor, <b>border</b> <b>line</b> has been altered and corrected several times, until today. The second factor of bordering is a kind of geographical terrain, according to which the border had mostly been defined, according to possibility of traveling across the mountains and river valleys. There are fewer changes of borders according to this factor, since it was usually in accordance with actual border between local inhabitants which live in border region. The third factor is traffic-communication infrastructure, according to which, the development of such infrastructure is also the key factor of defining the <b>border</b> <b>line.</b> The fourth factor is the economical justification of moving the <b>border</b> <b>line,</b> according to which, the possibility for better economical life of border inhabitants, and their employment in some of existing manufacturing capacities, is also an important factor in defining the <b>border</b> <b>line.</b> The fifth factor is the historical tradition and the international justification of existing of such defined <b>border</b> <b>line</b> of the Northern border of Macedonia...|$|R

500|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, controversies have arisen {{regarding}} {{the accuracy of}} the monument's placement. After the initial surveys, {{it was found that the}} borders did not always follow the lines of meridian and parallel (as they had been intended to) due to the primitive surveying technology available at the time of construction. This discrepancy left the four states asking if the correct borders were the exact lines of meridian and parallel (and if new, more accurate, surveys needed to be done), or if the markers placed during the initial surveys were now the actual border. The issue was resolved when New Mexico sued Colorado in 1919, and in 1925 the Supreme Court ruled that the markers placed during the initial surveys were the actual borders, even if the markers were off in some locations (this includes the Four Corners Monument). Today's legal description of these <b>border</b> <b>lines</b> is based on the original markers, and not the written description of the borders created when the territories were formed. Because of this, the borders between these states are not perfectly straight and often zigzag. One example is the border between Colorado and Utah, where in one area the border jogs west about [...] from where it was intended to be placed (...) [...] Because this error occurred in the original survey—which superseded the written description (being simply the 32nd meridian west of Washington), the border set out by the markers remains the border between the two states.|$|E
