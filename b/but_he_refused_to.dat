Vasilevsky in turn, took it upon his own initiative and gave Bagramyan the go ahead. However, with the loss of 4th Shock Army, Bagramyan was left shortchanged since his promised 39th Army had not only not arrived but was composed of only seven divisions (in comparison to 4th Shock's ten). Feeling that time was being lost, he pressed on with the units he had.|$|E

5|$|Potocki was an alumnus of the Collegium Nobilium in Warsaw, {{where he}} was a student in the years 1761–1765.

On 27 December 1772 he married Elżbieta Lubomirska. This marriage brought him close to the political faction of Familia.

5|$|Sanders {{was unhappy}} with the 35 minutes it took to prepare his chicken in an iron frying pan, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> deep fry the chicken, which he {{believed}} lowered {{the quality of the}} product. If he pre-cooked the chicken in advance of orders, there was sometimes wastage at day's end. In 1939, the first commercial pressure cookers were released onto the market, mostly designed for steaming vegetables. Sanders bought one, and modified it into a pressure fryer, which he then used to fry chicken. The new method reduced production time to be comparable with deep frying, while, in the opinion of Sanders, retaining the quality of pan-fried chicken.|$|E

In September 1874, following a long delay calling the volksraad due to sickness, Burgers proposed a railway to Delagoa Bay {{and said he would}} go to Europe to raise the necessary funds. By the time he left in February 1875 opposition pressure had brought about an amendment to bring religious instruction back into school hours, and Kruger had been restored to the executive council.|$|E

5|$|By the {{day after}} the regular session ended, Dayton had vetoed all of the budget bills passed by the legislature, and said in a {{statement}} that he anticipated a shutdown would occur. Dayton did not call a special session of the legislature to further address the budget during May or June, claiming that the lack of agreement between him and Zellers and Koch would make it unproductive to do so. He remained in contact with legislative leaders, sticking by the $35.8 billion budget he proposed late in the session, with minor changes. As the end of June approached, Koch urged the governor to call a session to pass a temporary 'lights-on' bill while a final deal was reached, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> answer this proposal on the grounds that extending the budget's deadline would not serve the goal of reaching a final agreement. Since the budget impasse had not ended by the end of June 30, the shutdown began at midnight of June 30–July 1, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, Crittenden {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House via a special election. He served as Speaker of the House for his entire term. In 1830, he was the Whig nominee to replace John Rowan in the Senate. Secretly, the party wished to {{nominate}} Henry Clay, giving him a springboard from which to launch another presidential campaign, but it was unknown whether {{he would be able to}} secure enough votes for confirmation; it was decided that Crittenden would be the nominee, and if the voting favored the Whigs by a large enough margin, Crittenden would withdraw and allow them to confirm Clay instead. The Democrats countered successively with Richard Mentor Johnson, John Rowan, Charles A. Wickliffe, and John Breathitt. None of them polled more than sixty-four of the sixty-nine votes needed for confirmation. Crittenden garnered sixty-eight votes on fourteen different ballots, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> vote for himself because he wanted Clay to be the nominee. Some of Crittenden's supporters, however, refused to vote for Clay, and the seat was left vacant.|$|E
5|$|In March 1807, about 125 {{students}} {{organized a}} protest against the college's strict conduct policies and rigorous study requirements. The protest included signing a formal petition of protest; college administrators subsequently suspended everyone who refused to withdraw his name from the petition. Breckinridge was required to apologize {{for his part in}} the protest in order to return to school, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> do so. In May, he left Princeton for Cabell's Dale, but in Philadelphia he found that there were no available stages heading west for two weeks. Unable to afford room and board for that long, he went to Fincastle, Virginia, to stay with relatives. He considered enrolling at the College of William and Mary for the fall term in 1807, believing he could complete his studies in nine months but ultimately decided against it. Harrison surmises that the lack of correspondence between Breckinridge and his family in Kentucky between July 1807 to July 1808 indicated that he was at Cabell's Dale during most or all of that period.|$|E
