Seventy percent of Fairview's production is exported, with the company's leading export markets being the United States, Canada, The United Kingdom, Sweden and Germany.

5000|$|Lhasa Beer is {{the only}} Tibetan beer {{on the world market}} and has grown in {{production}} in recent years through the Lhasa Brewery Company's increasing connections and investment internationally by Carlsberg. It is an all-malt European style lager, but is made from ingredients such as Himalayan spring water, barley, saaz hops and yeast. However, 30 percent of the malt content derives from the huskless native Tibetan barley which is partly responsible for giving the beer its characteristic crisp clean taste, along with the aromatic saaz ingredient. The beer is sold in cans, a 12-ounce bottle in packs of 6, and in 24 <b>bottle</b> <b>cases,</b> with the motto [...] "Beer from the Roof of the World".|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, sales slowed, largely blamed on {{competition}} from private label grocery store soft drink brands. The original company ceased operations in 1983 and its trademarks expired in 1993. A few small soft drink bottlers in the U.S. have at times sold pop {{using some of}} the millions of <b>bottles</b> and <b>cases</b> left abandoned by the closure; those were not related or authorized brands.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, wine {{could only be}} bought through off {{licences}} or specialist wine retailers, usually in city centres, and only during limited hours. Using his merchandising expertise, Graner conceived the idea of selling wine throughout the day via a warehouse, with a minimum purchase of twelve <b>bottles</b> (one <b>case)</b> to comply with licensing laws at the time. Another innovation was that individual wines could be tasted before buying.|$|R

2500|$|Dies for <b>bottle</b> neck <b>cases</b> {{usually are}} {{supplied}} in sets {{of at least}} two dies, though sometimes a third is added for crimping. This is an extra operation and is not needed unless a gun's magazine or action design requires crimped ammunition for safe operation, such as autoloading firearms, where the cycling of the action may push the bullet back in the case, resulting in poor accuracy and increased pressures. [...] Crimping is also sometimes recommended to achieve full velocity for bullets, through increasing pressures so as to make powders burn more efficiently, and for heavy recoiling loads, to prevent bullets from moving under recoil. [...] For FMJ bullets mounted in <b>bottle</b> neck <b>cases,</b> roll crimping is generally not ever used unless a cannelure is present on the bullet, to prevent causing bullet deformation when crimping. [...] Rimless, straight wall cases, on the other hand, require a taper crimp, because they headspace on the case mouth; roll crimping causes headspacing problems on these cartridges. Rimmed, belted, or bottleneck cartridges, however, generally can safely be roll crimped when needed. Three dies are normally supplied for straight walled cases, with an optional fourth die for crimping. Crimps for straight wall cases may be taper crimps, suitable for rimless cartridges used in autoloaders, or roll crimps, which are best for rimmed cartridges such as are used in revolvers.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of topical heat for therapeutic purposes has become commonplace in America. It {{is used by}} professionals including physical therapists and physicians to treat their patients {{as well as by}} individuals within their home or at work. Using computer simulation of two-dimensional heat transfer through the outer tissue layers of the body, the process of heat transfer and temperature gradients within the tissues can be predicted. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the temperature gradient of the muscle layer after applications of heat for less than one-half hour. Finite energy heat sources such as a hot water bottle as well as electric heat constant-temperature sources were evaluated. Applied temperatures were maintained at 50 C or less so not to irritate the skin surface. It was determined in all cases that the temperature of the muscle did not significantly increase within our time frame and actually began to cool after fifteen minutes with the hot water <b>bottle</b> <b>case</b> studies. On the other hand, the temperature of the epidermal-dermal layer, where nerve endings exist, remained at an elevated state of above 40 C for an extended period of time. It is inferred that a heat stimulated response of the neurons may be the cause of muscle relaxation and pain relief when a topical heat source is applied...|$|R
