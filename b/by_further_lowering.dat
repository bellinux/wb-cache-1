In this work we consider the problem of computing the arithmetic sum over a specific directed acyclic network that is not a tree. We assume the sources to be i. i. d. Bernoulli with parameter 1 / 2. Even in this simple setting, we demonstrate that upper bounding the computation rate is quite nontrivial. In particular, it requires us to consider variable length network codes and relate the upper bound to equivalently lower bounding the entropy of descriptions observed by the terminal conditioned on the function value.

50|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that it is widely {{referred}} to as an antiandrogen in the literature, bifluranol is actually a pure estrogen and does not significantly bind to the androgen receptor or directly antagonize the action of androgens. It exerts functional antiandrogen effects by binding to and activating the estrogen receptor in the pituitary gland, consequently suppressing the secretion of luteinizing hormone (and hence acting as an antigonadotropin) and thereby reducing gonadal androgen production and systemic androgen levels. Bifluranol has also been found to act as a 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase inhibitor, though with less potency than ketoconazole, and this action may contribute to its efficacy in benign prostatic hyperplasia <b>by</b> <b>further</b> helping to <b>lower</b> androgen levels.|$|R

40|$|The arenavirus {{envelope}} glycoprotein (GPC) mediates viral entry through pH-induced membrane fusion in the endosome. This crucial {{process in the}} viral life cycle can be specifically inhibited in the New World arenaviruses by the small-molecule compound ST- 294. Here, we show that ST- 294 interferes with GPC-mediated membrane fusion by targeting {{the interaction of the}} G 2 fusion subunit with the stable signal peptide (SSP). We demonstrate that amino acid substitutions at lysine- 33 of the Junín virus SSP confer resistance to ST- 294 and engender de novo sensitivity to ST- 161, a chemically distinct inhibitor of the Old World Lassa fever virus. These compounds, as well as a broadly active inhibitor, ST- 193, likely share a molecular target at the SSP-G 2 interface. We also show that both ST- 294 and ST- 193 inhibit pH-induced dissociation of the G 1 receptor-binding subunit from GPC, a process concomitant with fusion activation. Interestingly, the inhibitory activity of these molecules can in some cases be overcome <b>by</b> <b>further</b> <b>lowering</b> the pH used for activation.

Here we recorded male fallow deer groans during the breeding season and investigated how key acoustic parameters (fundamental frequency and formant frequencies) vary {{as a function of}} the social context in which they are produced. We found that in the presence of females, male fallow deer produced groans with higher mean fundamental frequency when vocal males were also present than they did when no vocal males were in close vicinity. We attribute this to the increased arousal state typically associated with this context. In addition, groan minimum formant frequency spacing was slightly, but significantly lower (indicating marginally more extended vocal tracts) when males were alone than when potential mates and/or competitors were nearby. This indicates that, contrary to our predictions, male fallow deer do not exaggerate the acoustic impression of their body size <b>by</b> <b>further</b> <b>lowering</b> their formant frequencies in the presence of potential mating partners and competitors.

Standard solder paste print & reflow techniques can be utilized but the resultant bumps invariably fall below specifications due to process limitations.

This paper details work undertaken to combine the benefits of standard stencil printer technology with that of solid solder sphere placement to enable the development of a low cost, flexible system for the bumping of wafer level packages. Actual preform-ball printing takes place by using the same standard stencil printer equipment as for solder paste printing. Prior to ball print, flux is printed on the wafer pads by screen printing.

40|$|We investigate, {{in three}} spatial dimensions, the {{transition}} from the normal state to the Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superfluid phases. We make use of a Fourier expansion for the order parameter and the Green's functions to handle the quasiclassical equations {{in the vicinity of the}} transition. We show that, below the tricritical point, the transition is always first order. We find that, at the transition, the higher Fourier components in the order parameter are always essentially negligible. Below the tricritical point we have the already known result that the order parameter has a spatial dependence which is essentially cos(q. r). However when the temperature is lowered, the order parameter switches to a sum of two cosines, with equal weigths and wavevector with the same length, but orthogonal directions. Finally <b>by</b> <b>further</b> <b>lowering</b> the temperature, and down to T= 0, one finds a another transition toward an order parameter which is the sum of three cosines with again equal weigths and orthogonal directions. Hence the structure of the order parameter gets more complex as the temperature is lowered. On the other hand the resulting critical temperatures are found to be only slightly higher than the ones corresponding to the standard second order FFLO transition. We apply our results to the specific case of ultracold Fermi gases and show that the differences in atomic populations of the two hyperfine states involved in the BCS condensation display sizeable variations when one goes from the normal state to the superfluid FFLO phases, or one FFLO phase to another. Experimentally this should allow to identify clearly the various phase transitions. Comment: 15 pages, 12 figure...|$|E
40|$|Chlorinated solvents, such as {{trichloroethene}} (TCE), {{are major}} groundwater contaminants that often persist as dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) in subsurface environments. Microbial reductive dechlorination as a polishing step after physical-chemical treatments is a promising approach for the remediation of TCE-DNAPL source zones and dechlorination activity {{at or near}} the source zones can enhance DNAPL dissolution. The physicochemical properties of the aquifer can affect the microbial dechlorination activity and, hence, the TCE DNAPL dissolution. This dissertation explores the influence of geochemical factors on TCE dechlorination, more in particular the competition between microbial reduction of iron (III) minerals and dechlorination processes. Thermodynamic considerations as well as observed threshold hydrogen concentration show that iron (Fe) reducers can compete with anaerobic TCE dechlorinators. This competition can impede the enrichment of dechlorinating populations and inhibit anaerobic reductive dechlorination. All studies were performed by inoculating matrices with a mixed dechlorinating culture (KB- 1) that also contain Fe (III) reducers in order to limit the influence of the composition of the microbial communities on the microbial processes; all studies used formate as electron donor. In a first part, the influence of the quantity and mineralogy of Fe (III) minerals on TCE dechlorination was investigated. A matrix extraction procedure for testing bioavailable Fe (III) in sediments was also calibrated. Experiments were performed in batches with either 1) variable amounts of ferrihydrite or 2) with 14 different Fe (III) minerals coated onto or mixed in with quartz sand at constant total Fe and at a stoichiometric excess Fe (III) over electron donor. At constant total Fe in the sand, TCE dechlorination time varied with Fe mineralogy between 8 days (no Fe added) to > 120 days (Fe-containing bentonite). Poorly crystalline Fe (III) minerals increased the dechlorination time whereas crystalline Fe (III) minerals such as goethite or hematite had no effect. The TCE dechlorination time increased with increasing total reduced Fe and with increasing surface area of the Fe (III) minerals. Extractable Fe determined based on Fe (III) reduction using NH 2 OH. HCl predicted the competitive inhibition of TCE degradation in these model systems. This study shows that Fe mineralogy rather that total Fe content determines the competitive inhibition of TCE dechlorination. In a second part, the H 2 pressure was measured during dechlorination in presence and absence of Fe (III) to determine critical H 2 for the different terminal electron accepting reactions (TEAP) in the system. Different natural and synthetic Fe containing matrices were used and compared. Iron (III) and Mn (IV) reduction limited microbial dechlorination by decreasing the level of H 2 in the system and subsequently resulted in a H 2 limited condition. The H 2 measurements indicated that a wide concentration range of H 2 is possiblefor different TEAPs in these systems and that these TEAPs can therefore occur concurrently rather than exclusively. Differences in Fe (III) bioavailability and, hence, Fe (III) reduction partially explain this wide range. The distinction between dechlorination and other microbial reduction processes based on H 2 concentrations threshold values is not feasible under such conditions. Dechlorination leads to acidification and slows down dechlorination. In addition, acidification facilitates Fe (III) reduction because of increased Fe (III) solubility. In a third part, it was investigated if acidification and Fe (III) reduction have a synergistic inhibition on reductive dechlorination. Two common aquifer Fe (III) minerals, goethite and ferrihydrite and sand only as control were studied in batch bottles at different solution pH values (6. 2 - 7. 2). In the absence of Fe, lowering matrix pH between 7. 2 to 6. 2 increased the time for TCE degradation. At pH 7. 2, goethite did not affect TCE degradation time while ferrihydrite increased it. Iron reduction in ferrihydrite increased between pH 7. 2 and 6. 5 but decreased <b>by</b> <b>further</b> <b>lowering</b> pH to 6. 2, likely due to reduced microbial activity. This study confirms that TCE reduction is increasingly inhibited by the combined effect of acidification and bioavailable Fe (III), however no evidence was found for synergistic inhibition since Fe reduction did not increase as pH decreased. A fourth part of this work examined to what extent Fe (III) minerals affect dechlorination in environmental samples. Seventeen environmental matrices with contrasting properties (pH 3. 5 - 11; total Fe 0. 1 - 87 g kg- 1, total Fe (II) 0. 05 - 2 % of total Fe) were inoculated in unbuffered media with 1 mM TCE and 9 mM formate, sufficient for complete TCE dechlorination. The time for 90 % conversion of TCE to cis-DCE ranged 5 - > 100 days with only partial or no dechlorination past cis-DCE {{due to the lack of}} electron equivalents. Reduction of Fe (III), SO 42 -and NO 3 - was detected in almost all treatments. The TCE and cis-DCE dechlorination was completely inhibited below pH 4. 3, above pH 10. 5 and in matrices where Fe reduction was highest. No cis-DCE degradation was observed below pH 5. 9. The TCE dechlorination time and the inhibition of cis-DCE dechlorination increased with increasing concentrations of available Fe (III), determined with citrate bicarbonate extraction for matrices between pH 4. 3 - 10, however statistical effects were small (R 2 < 0. 30). Weak Fe extraction methods such as the citrate bicarbonate ascorbate extraction determines bioavailable Fe (III) in the matrix and predict the stoichiometric requirements of electron donor to overcome inhibition of dechlorination. The fifth part of this study assessed the role of Fe (III) minerals on the bio-enhanced dissolution of a TCE DNAPL. Columns were set up as 1 -D diffusion-cells consisting of a lower DNAPL layer, a layer with an aquifer matrix and an upper water layer that is regularly refreshed with formate containing medium. The matrices were either inert sand, inert sand coated with 2 -line ferrihydrite (HFO) and two environmental Fe containing matrices. In none of the diffusion cells, vinyl chloride or ethene was detected while dissolved and extractable Fe (II) increased strongly during 60 days incubation. The cis-DCE concentration peaked at 4. 0 cm from the DNAPL (inert sand) while it was at 3. 4 cm (sand + HFO), 1. 7 cm and 2. 5 cm (environmental samples). The TCE concentration gradients near the DNAPL indicate that the DNAPL dissolution rate was larger than that in an abiotic cell by factors 1. 3 (inert sand), 1. 0 (sand + HFO) and 2. 2 (both environmental samples). This results show that high bioavailable Fe (III) in the HFO reduces the TCE degradation by competitive Fe (III) reduction, yielding lower bioenhanced dissolution. However, Fe (III) reduction in the environmental samples was not affecting bioenhanced dissolution which was even larger than in inert sand. It is speculated that physical factors, e. g., micro-niches in the environmental samples, protect microorganisms from toxic concentrations of TCE. In conclusion, this work demonstrated that Fe (III) reduction can limit the overall dechlorination rate and bioenhanced dissolution. Amorphous Fe (III) oxyhydroxides are readily reduced and largely inhibit dechlorination whereas crystalline Fe (III) oxyhydroxides have weak or no effects. Effects of Fe on dechlorination past cis-DCE are larger than on TCE and this deserves further study. The occurrence of multiple terminal electron acceptors increase the electron donor consumption and result in a cis-DCE or VC stall due to the electron donor limitation. Addition of surplus electron donor without calculations can overstimulate methanogens and also can increase the bioremediation costs. Thus, a stoichiometric calculation of electrons equivalents is necessary to match the Fe (III) reduction. Citrate bicarbonate ascorbate extraction is recommended as a simple matrix Fe extraction assay in order to approximate the electron equivalents necessary for depleting the bioavailable Fe fraction. Acid pH conditions can severely limit the dechlorination and iron reduction can acts as an additive stress factor in the acid systems limiting the microbial dechlorination capacity.

40|$|Background and aims: Activation {{of brown}} adipose tissue (BAT) reduces both hyperlipidemia and {{atherosclerosis}} {{by increasing the}} uptake of triglyceride-derived fatty acids by BAT, accompanied by formation and clearance of lipoprotein remnants. We tested {{the hypothesis that the}} hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants generated by BAT activation would be accelerated by concomitant statin treatment, thereby further reducing hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Methods: APOE* 3 -Leiden. CETP mice were fed a Western-type diet and treated without or with the selective beta 3 -adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist CL 316, 243 that activates BAT, atorvastatin (statin) or both. Results: beta 3 -AR agonism increased energy expenditure {{as a result of an}} increased fat oxidation by activated BAT, which was not <b>further</b> enhanced <b>by</b> statin addition. Accordingly, statin treatment neither influenced the increased uptake of triglyceride-derived fatty acids from triglyceride-rich lipoprotein-like particles <b>by</b> BAT nor <b>further</b> <b>lowered</b> plasma triglyceride levels induced by beta 3 -AR agonism. Statin treatment increased the hepatic uptake of the formed cholesterol-enriched remnants generated by beta 3 -AR agonism. Consequently, statin treatment <b>further</b> <b>lowered</b> plasma cholesterol levels. Importantly, statin, in addition to beta 3 -AR agonism, also further reduced the atherosclerotic lesion size as compared to beta 3 -AR agonism alone, without altering lesion severity and composition. Conclusions: Statin treatment accelerates the hepatic uptake of remnants generated by BAT activation, thereby increasing the lipid-lowering and anti-atherogenic effects of BAT activation in an additive fashion. We postulate that, in clinical practice, combining statin treatment with BAT activation is a promising new avenue to combat hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Excerpt] Studies {{have found}} {{consistently}} {{that there is}} a strong positive correlation between a worker 2 ̆ 7 s tenure with a firm and that individual 2 ̆ 7 s wage rate. Becker 2 ̆ 7 s (1975) on-the-job training (OJT) model is the most widely accepted explanation for this association. The OJT model posits that new employees receive training early in their tenure, which raises their productivity both in and outside the firm. Competition forces the employer to pay employees who have completed this training {{at least as much as}} they are worth outside the firm less transfer costs. Jobs that offer such training are more attractive than jobs that do not, so competition forces down the entry wage of jobs that provide training below the entry wage of jobs that offer no training. During the training period, the supervisors and other workers are spending time away from other activities, helping the new employee learn the job. The new employee may also spend time in learning activities instead of production activities. In order to offer training, the employer must be compensated for the resulting sacrifice in current output. When the training provides general skills, the only way such compensation can be provided is <b>by</b> a <b>further</b> <b>lowering</b> of the entry wage. Thus, there are two forces that cause wage rates of new employees to rise: the increase of the employee 2 ̆ 7 s productivity and the decline of training expenses. When training is entirely specific, and therefore does not raise the worker 2 ̆ 7 s productivity in other firms, the forces causing a rising wage profile are weaker. They do not disappear, however, for a rising wage profile reduces the quit rate of trained workers, and thus protects the firm 2 ̆ 7 s investment in training...|$|R

However, testosterone therapy does not always deepen the voice to the person's desired level, and others choose to not undergo hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male) at all.
