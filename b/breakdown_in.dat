5|$|An {{attempt to}} obtain {{information}} for Operation Dexterity, the attack on New Britain, with a joint Army-Navy reconnaissance team raised issues of inter-service cooperation. The Navy was mainly interested in gathering hydrographic data rather than information {{on the state of}} the Japanese defenders. Because of a <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> communications, the PT boat that was supposed to collect the team was unable to rendezvous with it, and the team had to spend eleven more days on the island. Finally, the Navy tried to prevent the Army commander from briefing Alamo Force headquarters on what had occurred.|$|E
5|$|Coenwulf {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury {{over the issue of}} whether laypeople could control religious houses such as monasteries. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> {{the relationship between the two}} eventually reached the point where the archbishop was unable to exercise his duties for at least four years. A partial resolution was reached in 822 with Coenwulf's successor, King Ceolwulf, but it was not until about 826 that a final settlement was reached between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, who had been the main beneficiary of Coenwulf's grants of religious property.|$|E

Furthermore, the Celts, led by a just-escaped Boudica, lay siege to York, with XIV Legion tasked with defending it until Commodus can escape. In the end, Marius sacrifices himself to buy time for the final ships to sail, but is resurrected by the goddess Summer, who tasks him with taking on the mantle of Damocles, a legendary Roman general who was abandoned to his enemies for political expediency. In that guise, Summer tells him to avenge his family and comrades, and save Rome.|$|E
5|$|Georgia {{began its}} first {{possession}} with a 25-yard kickoff return, {{but failed to}} earn a first down {{in the face of}} a tough Hokie defensive effort. Georgia punter Gordon Ely-Kelso kicked a 56-yard punt following the Virginia Tech defensive stop. A <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> special teams coverage by Georgia allowed Virginia Tech kick returner Eddie Royal to break free, returning the kick 56yards back to the original line of scrimmage. As a result of the excellent field position provided by the return, Virginia Tech was able to drive the remaining 30yards to the end zone. Branden Ore earned his second touchdown of the game, making the score 14–3 with 6:13 remaining on the clock.|$|E
5|$|In August 1849 the MCS {{appointed}} Joseph Bazalgette to {{the position}} of assistant surveyor. He had been working as a consultant engineer in the railway industry until overwork had brought about a serious <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> his health; his appointment to the commission was his first position on his return to employment. Working under the chief engineer, Frank Foster, he began to develop a more systematic plan for the city's sewers. The stress of his position was too much for Foster and he died in 1852; Bazalgette was promoted into his position, and continued refining and developing the plans {{for the development of the}} sewerage system. The Metropolis Management Act 1855 replaced the commission with the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW), which took control of the sewers.|$|E

At Saint-Briac Kirill, aware of the murders of Tsar Nicholas II and his only son, officially declared himself the Guardian of the Throne in 1924. Victoria went {{on a trip to}} the United States in 1924, hoping to raise American support for restoration of the monarchy. Her efforts evoked little response, due to the isolationism prevalent in the United States during the 1920s. She continued in her efforts to help Kirill restore the monarchy and also sold her artwork {{to raise money for the}} household.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the Franco–Belgian forces to hold the Ardennes gap was fatal. The Belgians had {{withdrawn}} laterally upon the initial invasion and had demolished and blocked routes of advance, which held up the French 2nd Army units moving north toward Namur and Huy. Devoid of any centre of resistance, the German assault engineers had cleared the obstacles unchallenged. The delay that the Belgian Ardennes Light Infantry, {{considered to be an}} elite formation, could have inflicted upon the advancing German armour was proved by the fight for Bodange, where the 1st Panzer Division was held up for a total of eight hours. This battle was a result of a <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> communications and ran contrary to the operational intentions of the Belgian Army.|$|E

5|$|The seeming {{failure of}} the RAAF and RAN to {{cooperate}} to finish off a damaged submarine led Royle to order an inquiry into the attack. This found that a <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> communication between the two services was {{the main cause of}} the failure, with both the aircraft and the naval signal room in Sydney making procedural errors. Rear Admiral Gerard Muirhead-Gould, the naval officer in command of the Sydney region, also noted that communications between the RAN and RAAF were unsatisfactory at higher levels, and that the communication procedures to be used in anti-submarine operations were not well known or understood. In response, he suggested that the RAN establish the position of Commander Escort Vessels Group to organise and command escorts and coordinate their tactics.|$|E
5|$|The three legions in Pannonia (VIII Augusta, XIX Hispana, and XV Apollinaris) {{were under}} the command of Junius Blaesus, who allowed his men a rest from {{military}} duties to mourn the death of Augustus. There was a <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> discipline, and the soldiers stopped obeying orders as a result. They soon became restless and lashed out against their officers, including Blaesus and a centurion named Aufidienus Rufus.

5|$|Ultimately the Gallipoli {{campaign}} was a disastrous failure. It did not achieve {{any of the}} objectives that had been given as a justification for it, and due to the inexperience of high commanders and mismanagement there were an unacceptably high number of casualties amongst the participating troops, not only from {{as a result of}} combat, but also due to widespread disease that resulted from poor sanitation and hygiene in the front lines and a <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> the casualty clearance and resupply and logistics systems. It has been estimated that {{over the course of the}} campaign there were 26,111 Australian casualties with 8,141 killed. Other Allied casualties—killed and wounded—included: 7,571 New Zealanders, 120,000 British and 27,000 French.|$|E
5|$|By 1965, the Americans {{were looking}} for someone to {{overthrow}} Khánh, and these efforts were spearheaded by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, who had begun encouraging other senior officers to move against Khánh {{since the start of the}} year, even though there was still significant hesitation and opposition to any regime change back in Washington. At the time, the US was planning to start a large-scale bombing campaign against the communist north and regarded Khánh's reliance on Buddhist support as an obstacle to their aims. Furthermore, Taylor and Khánh developed an intense personal antipathy for one another, which culminated in a <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> their relationship; in December 1964, Khánh's junta deposed the High National Council, a civilian advisory body that was designed to give a semblance of civilian rule. This resulted in Taylor angrily condemning Khánh and his generals in private to the point of suggesting Khánh resign the leadership. Khánh responded by threatening to expel Taylor, and going on a media offensive against the ambassador. Taylor threatened to withhold military aid, but the Americans could not do so because of their overriding desire to see the military defeat of the communists, and without foreign funding, South Vietnam could not survive.|$|E
5|$|Coenwulf's early reign {{was marked}} by a <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> Mercian control in {{southern}} England. In East Anglia, King Eadwald minted coins at about this time, implying {{that he was no}} longer subject to Mercia. A charter of 799 seems to show that Wessex and Mercia were estranged for some time before that date, though the charter is not regarded as undoubtedly genuine. In Kent, an uprising began, probably starting after Ecgfrith's death, though {{it has been suggested that}} it began much earlier in the year, before Offa's death. The uprising was led by Eadberht Præn, who had been an exile at Charlemagne's court: Eadberht's cause almost certainly had Carolingian support. Eadberht became king of Kent, and Æthelheard, the archbishop of Canterbury at that time, fled his see; it is likely that Christ Church, Canterbury was sacked.|$|E
