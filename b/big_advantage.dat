5|$|At the beginning, Lasker {{tried to}} attack but Schlechter had no {{difficulty}} defending, {{so that the}} first four games finished in draws. In the fifth game Lasker had a <b>big</b> <b>advantage,</b> but committed a blunder that cost him the game. Hence at {{the middle of the}} match Schlechter was one point ahead. The next four games were drawn, despite fierce play from both players. In the sixth Schlechter managed to draw a game being a pawn down. In the seventh Lasker nearly lost because of a beautiful exchange sacrifice from Schlechter. In the ninth only a blunder from Lasker allowed Schlechter to draw a lost ending. The score before the last game was thus 5–4 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win tactically and took a <b>big</b> <b>advantage,</b> but he missed a clear win at the 35th move, continued to take increasing risks and finished by losing. Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion.|$|E
5|$|Clarke held a <b>big</b> <b>advantage</b> in the {{campaign}} as he {{was supported by the}} Métis who had been looking for someone to locally represent them in the Legislature since the territory was formed in 1870. Clarke had also built his popularity and name recognition as a prominent fur trader. On election day Clarke carried the district winning a solid victory. He defeated Moore winning nearly 64% of popular vote. His resounding win would make him the first elected member to sit on the Northwest Territories council.|$|E
5|$|In Sicily, the {{decision}} was taken not just for fashion and appearance {{but also because it}} would minimise the damage to property and life likely to be caused in future quakes. In 1693, the cramped housing and streets had caused buildings to collapse together like dominoes. Although after the earthquake the avenues were broadened and the density of housing was lowered overall, cramped and narrow areas of housing still remained, posing a hazard for the poor. Architecturally and aesthetically, the <b>big</b> <b>advantage</b> of the new order of town planning was that unlike many Italian towns and cities, where one frequently encounters a monumental Renaissance church squeezed terrace fashion between incongruous neighbours, in urban Baroque design one can step back and actually see the architecture in a more conducive setting in relation to its proportions and perspective. This is most notable in the largely rebuilt towns of Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa, and Scicli.|$|E

25|$|Use {{of other}} {{emergency}} air {{sources such as}} octopus second stage, integrated DV/BC inflator units, bailout cylinders etc. also requires the learning of appropriate skills. These procedures are as complex as buddy breathing {{up to the point}} of sharing, and the fundamental difference is that the donor and recipient are not required to alternate breathing with a period when no air is available, which can be a <b>big</b> <b>advantage.</b> These alternatives to buddy breathing also require substantial learning and reinforcement to be reliable in a stressful situation.|$|E
25|$|LeMay was a Heathkit {{customer}} and active amateur radio operator {{and held a}} succession of call signs; K0GRL, K4FRA, and W6EZV. He held these calls respectively while stationed at Offutt AFB, Washington, D.C. and when he retired in California. K0GRL is still the call sign of the Strategic Air Command Memorial Amateur Radio Club. He was famous for being on the air on amateur bands while flying on board SAC bombers. LeMay became aware that the new single sideband (SSB) technology offered a <b>big</b> <b>advantage</b> over amplitude modulation (AM) for SAC aircraft operating long distances from their bases. In conjunction with Heath engineers and Art Collins (W0CXX) of Collins Radio, he established SSB as the radio standard for SAC bombers in 1957.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half, the Cowboys scored their only {{touchdown}} {{in the third quarter}} with a two-yard touchdown run by Marion Barber. Finally in the fourth quarter New Orleans got a touchdown when running back Mike Bell scored from one yard out to make a 24–10 Dallas lead. Drew Brees also made a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lance Moore. After that, Nick Folk attempted a 24-yard field goal, but the kick was no good. With a <b>big</b> <b>advantage</b> to take the lead as the clock was expiring, the Saints were driving for the game-tying score, but DeMarcus Ware made his second sack on Drew Brees, which again caused the ball to be fumbled. This time the ball was recovered by nose guard Jay Ratliff. With the ball in possession, Dallas took a knee to conclude the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} digital {{technologies}} like the microprocessor {{has provided the}} motivation to advance MOSFET technology faster than {{any other type of}} silicon-based transistor. A <b>big</b> <b>advantage</b> of MOSFETs for digital switching is that the oxide layer between the gate and the channel prevents DC current from flowing through the gate, further reducing power consumption and giving a very large input impedance. The insulating oxide between the gate and channel effectively isolates a MOSFET in one logic stage from earlier and later stages, which allows a single MOSFET output to drive a considerable number of MOSFET inputs. Bipolar transistor-based logic (such as TTL) does not have such a high fanout capacity. This isolation also makes it easier for the designers to ignore to some extent loading effects between logic stages independently. That extent is defined by the operating frequency: as frequencies increase, the input impedance of the MOSFETs decreases.|$|E
500|$|X-Men: Days of Future Past is {{the first}} X-Men film to be filmed in native 3D; it was shot using Arri Alexa-M cameras with Leica Prime lenses and Fujinon Zoom lenses, along with 3ality Technica TS-35 camera rigs and Stereo Image Processor (SIP) {{technology}} systems. Director of photography Newton Thomas Sigel was asked about using Arri Alexa-M cameras; he said, [...] "For Bryan and myself, the Alexa has been almost the gateway to getting the look we like in film". Sigel added that the Arri Alexa-M camera's small size was a <b>big</b> <b>advantage</b> to the film's main unit, which carried three 3D rigs. The film also used the Alexa XTs for the production's 2D work.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{previous}} study of MUSIC algorithm and ESPRIT algorithm, {{we know that they}} both belong to subspace class algorithm, so similar to MUSIC algorithm, ESPRIT algorithm can also be combined with time-frequency analysis integrated polarization information, which is polarimetric time-frequency ESPRIT (PTF-ESPRIT) algorithm. The <b>biggest</b> <b>advantage</b> of the MUSIC algorithm is the high accuracy of estimation, while the ESPRIT algorithm has the <b>biggest</b> <b>advantage</b> of fast calculation. Therefore, the PTF-ESPRIT algorithm should have a faster calculation speed than PTF-MUSIC algorithm in theory. The TLS-ESPRIT algorithm is used in this section.|$|R

500|$|This game {{turned out}} to be the last game. Fischer used a line of the Sicilian that he had never before played as Black, and further {{surprised}} Spassky with a novelty on move eight. After 14...Qxf6 the game was equal (Taimanov). Spassky played badly in the endgame and the game was adjourned with a <b>big</b> <b>advantage</b> for Fischer. However, Fischer's 40th move was not the best; he should have played 40...Kg4! before ...h5 (his actual 40th move). Had Spassky sealed 41.Kh3! (preventing ...Kg4), he would have had drawing chances. However, his 41.Bd7? would have allowed Black to win with 41...Kg4 followed by pushing his h-pawn. On September 1, the day scheduled for resumption of the game, arbiter Lothar Schmid informed Fischer and the audience that Spassky had resigned the game by telephone, making Fischer the winner of the match. Euwe expressed disappointment that Spassky had not arrived at the playing hall to congratulate Fischer in person.|$|E
500|$|The South Vietnamese {{eventually}} {{had their}} way. As the generals and Hương {{were unwilling to}} reinstate the HNC, Taylor sent General John L. Throckmorton to meet them and mend relations. Throckmorton told the Vietnamese generals they had read too much into Taylor's comments and that the US {{had no intention of}} pressuring them out of power with aid cuts. Cang appeared unimpressed, while Thiệu and Kỳ made indirect and vague comments about what they perceived to be misleading tactics during the talks. Khánh appeared reassured by Throckmorton's overtures and made a public statement on December 30, saying he was not as hostile to the Americans as reported, and he wanted Thiệu and Cang to meet the Americans to relieve any remaining tension. He also claimed privately that the statements attributed to him by Deepe were false and set up a bilateral committee to discuss tensions. The generals eventually won out, as the Americans did not move against them in any way for their refusal to reinstate the HNC. The South Vietnamese won in large part because the Americans had spent so much on the country, and could not afford to abandon it and lose to the communists over the matter of military rule, as a communist takeover would be a big public relations coup for the Soviet bloc. According to Karnow, for Khánh and his officers, [...] "their weakness was their strength". An anonymous South Vietnamese government official said [...] "Our <b>big</b> <b>advantage</b> over the Americans is that they want to win the war more than we do." ...|$|E
