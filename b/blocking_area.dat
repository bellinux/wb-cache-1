50|$|In early December, an upper-level trough became {{trapped in}} {{steering}} currents near the British Isles. When an upper-level low strengthened to its west, an extratropical cyclone formed in response on December 3. The cyclone then completed a clockwise loop {{in response to}} the <b>blocking</b> <b>area</b> of high pressure to its north that would have otherwise caused the storm to move towards mainland Europe. Shortly thereafter, the radius of maximum winds - which are usually large in extratropical cyclones - began to contract, signifying the onset of a subtropical transition, despite being over 72 °F (22 °C) sea surface temperatures. Low wind shear in the area allowed the system to transition into a subtropical storm on December 5 on 00:00 UTC. However, the National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories, particularly due to predictions of stronger wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures preventing additional development. The storm continued to show more signs of becoming tropical, however, it failed to complete the transition. By December 7, stronger wind shear and cooler waters took its toll on the system, and it weakened to a remnant low, dissipating shortly afterwards. The storm produced sustained winds of 37 mph (59 km/h) on Santa Maria Island in the Azores, with gusts to 54 mph (87 km/h).|$|E
5000|$|Goaltenders wear special leg pads {{to protect}} their legs and knees. Leg pads have evolved {{significantly}} over the years. The earliest leg pads were {{very similar to the}} cricket pads from which they were adopted. They were constructed of leather and stuffed with deer hair. In the 1930s, leg pads became more specialized, becoming wider and thicker. In the 1940s, an extra roll of material, called a skip-over roll, was added to the outside edge of each pad face, extending from the lowest point of the pad covering the foot, called the boot break, to just below the knee rolls. In the 1950s, the skip-over roll was extended to {{the very top of the}} leg pad. In the 1980s, additional padding was added to protect the inside areas of the legs and knees. Toe foils, a plastic shield that was affixed to the bottom outside edge of the goalie pad, began to be used but were later not allowed by equipment regulations. Leg pad design and construction remained static until the 1990s when synthetic leathers and high density foams began to be used in pad construction. Advantages of synthetic materials were lighter weight, lower cost, a quick break-in period, and leg pads that could be manufactured in the colors of the goaltender's team. Some leg pad manufacturers replaced the leather toe strap with a toe bridge to affix the front of the leg pad to the front of the goalie skate. Starting around 2000, the [...] "box" [...] style leg pads became popular as goaltending playing technique evolved to a blocking style versus the reacting style of the past. In the [...] "box" [...] style pad, the edge between the pad face and the pad inside edge is square, keeping the pad face more perpendicular with the ice surface and maximizing the <b>blocking</b> <b>area</b> when the goaltender is in the [...] "butterfly" [...] position. Currently, ice hockey regulations require that leg pads be no wider than 11 in and can be no longer than 38 in. The NHL has also brought in rules stating that each goaltender will be measured for height, and then the height of allowable pads will be calculated in proportion to the height of the goaltender.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{traditional}} and swing blocking techniques on center of mass (COM) projectile motion and effective <b>blocking</b> <b>area</b> in nine healthy Division I female volleyball players. Two high-definition (1080 p) video cameras (60 Hz) were used to collect two-dimensional variables from two separate views. One was placed perpendicular to the plane of the net and the other was directed along the top of the net, and were used to estimate COM locations and <b>blocking</b> <b>area</b> in a plane parallel to the net and hand penetration through the plane of the net respectively. Video of both the traditional and swing techniques were digitized and kinematic variables were calculated. Paired samples t-tests indicated that the swing technique resulted in greater (p < 0. 05) vertical and horizontal takeoff velocities (vy and vx), jump height (H), duration of the block (tBLOCK), blocking coverage during the block (C) as well as hand penetration above and through the net’s plane (YPEN, ZPEN). The traditional technique had significantly greater approach time (tAPP). The results of this study suggest that the swing technique results in both greater jump height and effective <b>blocking</b> <b>area.</b> However, the shorter tAPP that occurs with swing is associated with longer times in the air during the block which may reduce the ability of the athlete to make adjustments to attacks designed to misdirect the defense...|$|E

It is shown that the static aerodynamic coefficients of several configurations are in good agreement with available data, and assisted in validating the experimental technique employed.

30|$|Many {{techniques}} {{have been proposed}} in the literature to mitigate these problems, ranging from contention window adaptation, transmit power control [6], tuning of the threshold [7] to rate adaptation [8] and routing [9]. All techniques aim at balancing {{the negative impact of}} the exposed node versus the hidden node problems. For example, an increase in transmit power improves the energy received at the receiver and silences more nodes (increases the <b>blocking</b> <b>area)</b> hence decreasing the number and impact of hidden nodes collisions. However, this comes at the cost of a higher number of exposed nodes hence degrading the spatial-reuse gain. In [10], it is shown that the exposed node problem, when relying on distributed resource allocation, should not be avoided but that there is an optimal trade-off between the two problems. No MAC-layer techniques only is capable of removing the inefficiencies of the hidden versus exposed node problems.|$|E

Several fuel systems and flame holders were investigated in a 29 -inch-diameter tail-pipe burner {{to determine the effect}} of fuel distribution and flame-holder design on tail-pipe-burner performance and operational characteristics over a range of simulated flight conditions. At an altitude of 5000 feet, the type of flame holder used had only a slight effect on the combustion efficiency. As the altitude was increased, the decrease in peak combustion efficiency became more rapid as the <b>blocking</b> <b>area</b> of the flame holder was reduced. At all altitudes investigated, an improvement in the uniformity of the radial distribution of fuel and air slightly increased the peak combustion efficiencies and shifted the peak combustion efficiency to higher tail-pipe fuel-air ratios. The use of an internal cooling liner extending the full length of the tail-pipe combustion chamber provided adequate shell cooling at all flight conditions investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between atmospheric blocking over Europe and the Atlantic eddy-driven jet stream is investigated in the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis {{and in a}} climate model. This is carried out using a bidimensional blocking index based on geopotential height and a diagnostic providing daily latitudinal position and strength of the jet stream. It is shown that European Blocking (EB) is not decoupled from the jet stream but it is mainly associated with its poleward displacements. Moreover, the whole <b>blocking</b> <b>area</b> placed on the equatorward side of the jet stream, broadly ranging from Azores up to Scandinavia, emerges as associated with poleward jet displacements. The diagnostics are hence applied to two different climate model simulations in order to evaluate the biases in the jet stream and in the blocking representation. This analysis highlights large underestimation of EB, typical feature of general circulation models. Interestingly, observed blocking and jet biases over the Euro-Atlantic area {{are consistent with the}} blocking-jet relationship observed in the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis. Finally, the importance of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) is investigated showing that realistic SSTs can reduce the bias in the jet stream variability but not in the frequency of EB. We conclude highlighting that blocking-related diagnostics can provide more information about the Euro-Atlantic variability than diagnostics simply based on the Atlantic jet stream...|$|E
30|$|Hou [28] {{introduced}} a fast human detection and classification method using HOG features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed method comprised of three primary steps: (a) detection of moving regions from the video sequence, (b) extraction of HOG features of moving regions, and (c) utilizing SVM to classify the moving regions. Similarly, Qixiang [29] presented an Error-Correcting Output Code (ECOC) based on manifold clustering strategy for human detection. The proposed technique worked efficiently with multi-view and multi-posture problems. Dewei [30] {{introduced a}}n online expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm {{in order to}} estimate foreground and background. Later, the human samples are cropped from the estimated foreground for HOG feature extraction. The SVM classification is employed. Javier et al. [31] introduced random subspace (RSM) algorithm for partially occluded human detection based on HOG and HOH-LBP feature. The extracted features were later classified by SVM method. Chung [32] proposed a hybrid technique to classify moving objects in the video sequences. Segmentation was performed using a histogram-based prominence approach; in addition, shadow removal technique was also implemented to improve the performance of human classification. HOG and wavelets were fused with local shape features to acquire the vector of principle values, and finally, the classification was carried out with SVM classifier. Tudor [33] introduced a human detection approach using temporal difference-based procedure and morphological operations such as closing and filling. Also, HOG-based matching features were introduced for detection. Van [34] introduced a variant scale block-based HOG features for human detection. The extracted features were constructed with multiple blocks of a variable size which were easily distinguishing {{the positive and negative}} human samples. In addition, they also merged SVM with boosted tree algorithm to construct a state-of-the-art classifier which improved the efficiency of the classification problem. Conde [35] presented a human detection method for video surveillance that worked in an uncontrolled environment. The strategy was based on the integration of HOG and Gabor features [36]. The performance was compared with existing methods like HOG-based human detection [14] and boosted tree classifier for object detection [37]. This proposed method also showed improved performance under complex situations like <b>blocking</b> <b>area,</b> partly covered and with baggage. Kim. D [38] introduced two novel feature descriptors: (a) binary HOG and local gradient patterns and (2) fusion of local transform features with a combination of several local features namely LBP, LGP, and HOG by Adaboost feature selection technique. The described feature selection method greatly improved the performance of human detection {{with the fact that the}} selection of extracted features plays a vital role. Qiming [39] introduced a robust discriminant-weighted sparse partial least squares feature selection algorithm for human detection. This method reduced the dimensions of extracted features like partial least square to efficiently recognize positive and negative human samples based on the latent matrix. Finally, the selected features were classified with a boosted tree algorithm. Lee [40] introduced a new technique to recognize human head and shoulders by extracting their edge information and geometric features.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{data have}} been {{accumulated}} {{in order to}} compare the optical stabilities of several 8, 8 '-disubstituted- 1, 1 '-binaphthyls, thus extending the work already done on the 8, 8 '-acid and its esters to blocking groups of distinctly different character. The compounds studied are 1, 1 '-binaphthyls substituted in 8 and 8 ' positions by hydroxymethyl, bromomethyl, methyl, methylene quinolinium bromide and methoxy carbonyl groups; in addition benzo- 1 ', 2 '- 7, 8 -benzanthrone- 3 '-carboxylic acid and its methyl ester have been prepared. All these compounds have been synthesised {{for the first time}} (except benzo- 11, 2 '- 7, 8 -benzanthrone- 3 '-carboxylic acid and its ester) and have been obtained in their optically active state for the first time. Their rate co-efficients for racemisation have been determined at several temperatures covering the range 30 °- 40 ° (except 8, 8 '-bisbromomethyl and 8, 8 '-bis(methylenequinolinium bromide) - 1, 1 '-binaphthyls which were decomposed in N,N-dimethylformamide). The solvent used for all the compounds was N,N-dimethylformamide. From the experimental results the Arrhenius parameters E and log 10 A and the Transition State Theory functions have been calculated using the equations. In the discussion the optical stability of optically labile substituted 1 ' 1 -binaphthyls have been described. A comparison of the racemisation parameters has been made which appears to show that the CH 3, and the CH 2 OH groups, which are rounded (or three dimensional) produce larger angular <b>blocking</b> <b>area</b> to passing than the -COOH and COOCH 3 or C 00 C 2 H 5 groups do, which are "flat". That is, 8, 8 '-bishydroxymethyl, 8, 8 '-dimethyl and 8 '-hydroxymethyl- 8 '-methoxy carbonyl- 1, 1 '-binaphthyls are more stable than 1, 1 '-binaphthyl- 8, 8 '-dicarboxylic acid and its ester. All these compounds are also concluded to be strained in their ground state as they are much less stable than the 1, 1 '-binaphthyl- 2, 2 '-dicarboxylic acid. The strain is obvious also from the models. In the experimental section the syntheses and the methods by which the optical activity was gained have been described. In the final part some infrared spectral data for 1, 1 '-binaphthyl- 8, 8 '-dicarboxylic acid, its ester and 1 ', 2 '- 7, 8 -(benzanthrone) " 3,-carboxylic acid is given. No complete conclusion can be drawn from these spectra, but it may be seen in 1, 1 '-binaphthyl- 8, 8 '-dicarboxylic acid the (+) and (-) forms have similar infrared spectra and hence have the same molecular configuration apart from the mirror image isomerism, while in (+) acid the infrared spectrum shows distinct differences therefore it probably has a different configuration. The difference could be because of the hydrogen bonding which may be different in the two cases owing to different spatial configuration of the carboxylic acid groups relative to each other. <p...|$|E
