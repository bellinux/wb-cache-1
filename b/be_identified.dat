5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of rhabdomyolysis may be suspected in {{anyone who has}} suffered trauma, crush injury or prolonged immobilization, {{but it may also}} <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> at a later stage due to deteriorating kidney function (abnormally raised or increasing creatinine and urea levels, falling urine output) or reddish-brown discoloration of the urine.|$|E
5|$|A print from Sheila's right {{ring finger}} {{was found on the}} right side of the butt, {{pointing}} downwards. A print from Bamber's right forefinger was on the rear end of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across the gun. He said he had used the gun to shoot rabbits.

5|$|According to some sources, {{the church}} could <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> with San Salvatore de Bordonia; a bordone was the staff borne by pilgrims coming to St. Peter's.

5|$|As initial {{cause for}} glacier retreat {{in the alps}} since 1850, a {{decrease}} of the glaciers albedo, caused by industrial black carbon can <b>be</b> <b>identified.</b> According to a report, this may have accelerated the retreat of glaciers in Europe which otherwise may have continued to expand until approximately the year 1910.|$|E

50|$|Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy, {{also known}} as Berardinelli-Seip {{lipodystrophy}} was first described in 1954 by Berardinelli and later by Seip in 1959.

5|$|As the SAS {{operation}} concluded, the Chinooks ferried {{prisoners and}} bodies from Gberi Bana to the Jordanian battalion of UNAMSIL. From there, the bodies would <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> and buried, and those prisoners identified as West Side Boys would {{be handed over}} to the Sierra Leonean Police. Operation Barras also freed 22 Sierra Leonean civilians who had been held captive by the West Side Boys—the men were used as servants and put through crude military training by the West Side Boys, possibly with the intention of forcing them to fight in the future, while the women were used as sex slaves. Planners had been concerned that West Side Boys might try to conceal themselves among the civilians and so the civilians were also restrained and taken to the Jordanian peacekeepers' base to <b>be</b> <b>identified.</b> A 23rd civilian was caught in the crossfire and killed during the assault.|$|E
5|$|Because fossils {{identifiable}} as P. sternbergi {{are found}} {{exclusively in the}} lower layers of the Niobrara Formation, and P. longiceps fossils exclusively in the upper layers, a fossil lacking the skull can <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> based on {{its position in the}} geologic column (though for many early fossil finds, precise data about its location was not recorded, rendering many fossils unidentifiable).|$|E

5|$|Gergonne's insight {{was that}} if a line L1 could be {{constructed}} such that A1 and B1 were guaranteed to fall on it, those two points could <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> as the intersection points of L1 with the given circle C1 (Figure6). The remaining four tangent points would be located similarly, by finding lines L2 and L3 that contained A2 and B2, and A3 and B3, respectively. To construct a line such as L1, two points must <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> that lie on it; but these points need not be the tangent points. Gergonne was able to identify two other points {{for each of the}} three lines. One of the two points has already been identified: the radical center G lies on all three lines (Figure6).|$|E
5|$|Humpbacks {{can easily}} <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> by their stocky body, obvious hump, black dorsal {{coloring}} and elongated pectoral fins. The head and lower jaw {{are covered with}} knobs called tubercles, which are hair follicles and are characteristic of the species. The fluked tail, which typically rises above the surface when diving, has wavy trailing edges.|$|E

Although the producer of these faeces cannot <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> with certainty, marine turtles and dromaeosaurids such as Dromaeosauroides are the most likely candidates.|$|E
5|$|Living mammal {{species can}} <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> by the {{presence}} of sweat glands, including those that are specialized to produce milk to nourish their young.

5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law {{are parts of}} {{copyright}} law that protect the personal interests of {{the author of a}} copyrighted work, as well as the economic interests protected by other elements of copyright.

The right of paternity exists for the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E
