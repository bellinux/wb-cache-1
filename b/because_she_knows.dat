The town vet (Kwesi Ameyew) at the shelter where David works tells her the bird will be okay but only if she returns to her flock. David offers to help Mary Margaret return the dove but she declines. He follows her anyway {{and is able to}} save her from falling off a cliff. It starts to pour so the two take shelter in an empty cabin. David asks Mary Margaret what is wrong and she admits she still has {{feelings}} for him, and he is the reason she goes to Granny's at 7:15. David replies that he goes to Granny's to see her. They nearly kiss but Mary Margaret stops it <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> about Kathryn's pregnancy test. David explains that his feelings for Kathryn are memories but his feelings for Mary Margaret are real. She says they have to forget each other.|$|E
5|$|Whitney {{takes an}} {{interest}} in Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline) but refuses to date him. Whitney applies for a new work experience at the local nursery which she later gets. When Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) tells his brother Tyler about Whitney's recent ordeal, he rejects her but later gives her his special Moon pendant {{to make up for}} it. Whitney agrees to go on a date with Tyler and they agree to have sex but Whitney is unsure as she remembers her past and runs out, telling Tyler she never wants to see him again. Tyler is hurt. He later tells Fatboy she needs a shrink which Whitney overhears. She runs out and kisses Fatboy and starts a relationship with him. Fatboy publicly declares his love for Whitney, but when he is unable to give her a driving lesson, Lucy (now Hetti Bywater) suggests that Tyler do it, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> that Tyler likes Whitney. Whitney starts to feel smothered by Fatboy's affections. Lucy teases Tyler by telling him that Fatboy plans to publicly propose to Whitney, so Tyler tells Whitney he likes her but Whitney says it is too late. Tyler then surprises Whitney by kissing her. Whitney, feeling guilty, refuses to go on holiday with Fatboy, and tells him to kiss her. He does, but she says it is like kissing her best friend. She then admits she wants Tyler, and Fatboy is heartbroken. Whitney then goes to see Tyler but finds him with Lucy, kissing. She then tells Tyler to leave her alone. However, Tyler later tells Whitney that he cannot, as he loves her. Whitney admits to feeling the same way, and they begin a relationship.|$|E

Her role in the posse is to record {{important}} events (like an organizer) and tends to explain what Alana (and, later on, Bianca) say which is usually brief. She took over as Raven's foremost enemy after Bianca left. There is some speculation that she might be psychic <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> everything that Alana and Bianca are thinking.

25|$|Mia visits Peyton, and Peyton is {{concerned}} that Mia is not focused on her work. She suggests to Mia that she listen to a CD of songs she could possibly sing. They clash because Mia writes all of her own songs. Eventually, Peyton gives up on Mia and asks her to leave the label. Meanwhile, Peyton deals with stomach pains. She sees a doctor about it, and tells the doctor about Ellie's cancer. Her tearful face after the phone call predicts trouble ahead. Peyton later finds out {{that she does not}} have cancer, but is actually pregnant. She tells Lucas first, and Haley finds out in her own time, but Peyton seems hesitant to share her news with Brooke <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> how much Brooke has wanted a family. Peyton eventually tells Brooke, and Brooke is happy for her. Peyton has her first ultrasound, but is upset because she thinks that Lucas is too busy to come and has forgotten. Lucas surprises her by coming, and the two get to hear their baby's heartbeat for the first time. Later, Lucas and Peyton learn that Peyton has placenta praevia and that having this baby could mean the end of Peyton's life. Lucas, afraid of losing her and raising a child that has to go through the same motherless state Peyton did, tries to guilt her into an abortion. They get past this and decide to have the baby. Lucas tells her that he wants to get married to her sooner, not because she might die beforehand, but because he loves her, and wants her to be his wife. Lucas and Peyton get married at the lake where they met. Haley is the minister. After the reception, Lucas and Peyton go home and Peyton collapses on the floor while waiting for Lucas's surprise. Lucas walks in the house and finds Peyton unconscious on the floor in a pool of blood. Peyton is rushed to the hospital by a blood-covered Lucas, who begs her not to leave him. Peyton goes through an emergency caesarean section, and falls into a coma. The caesarean section is successful and she has a daughter named Sawyer Brooke Scott. She later awakes with Lucas and Brooke by her side. Karen brings in Sawyer, and Nathan, Haley, Jamie and Julian join them. Dan visits Peyton and she, after some hesitation, allows Dan to hold Sawyer. She and Lucas then leave Tree Hill.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for [...] "Breathe" [...] {{are about}} heartbreak {{and the loss}} of a person the narrator spent much time with. In the song's verses, the narrator {{acknowledges}} that people change and grow apart, though she is upset <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> the person [...] "like the back of her hand." [...] In the song's refrains, she realizes the need to remain strong and breathe in order to live without the person.

In the safe, Hayley finds [...] "sick" [...] pictures and a photo of Donna Mauer, a local girl who has been kidnapped and remains missing.

500|$|An {{accompanying}} music video, {{directed by}} Gregory Dark, {{was released on}} December 17, 1999. It portrayed Spears packing her belongings as she readies herself {{to move away from}} home, and feeling upset <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> that she is going to miss her first love. The video was the subject of controversy among the press, who panned the singer for hiring an adult filmmaker to direct her video. A Spears representative commented that they were only aware of Dark doing music videos. The singer performed [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] in a few live appearances, including at the 2000 Grammy Awards, in a medley with [...] "...Baby One More Time", and in three of her concert tours.|$|E
500|$|John Bradley, who portrays Samwell Tarly, {{also spoke}} about the scene, saying [...] "And what I like about that, and seeing her like that is you know then that her {{sexuality}} {{over the course of}} the last few seasons, we've seen her use as such a tool -- that's all very deliberate. She presents herself in this way as this beautiful woman <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> the effect that that can have on people. She knows the effect that that has on Stannis, and that can make men do unadvisable things. So the fact that she did that and she uses that power in that way to have this influence on people. That puts her into context as somebody who really does know what she's doing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} portrays Spears packing up her belongings, as she readies herself {{to move away}} from home, and feeling upset <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> that she is going to miss her first love. Throughout the video, scenes of the couple's past are also seen and Spears is sitting on a tyre swing, {{including}} one where they climb up onto a windmill, with Spears singing the song, and Spears is standing by a billboard that reads [...] "Welcome to Cedar Springs Gardens" [...] similar to the video [...] "Lucky". Before the end of the video, Spears is waiting at a bus stop while, at the same time, her first love is driving to come see her one last time. However, by the time he finally gets there, Spears had left him behind and taken the bus.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] {{are about a}} gender-swapping thought experiment, through which Beyoncé {{analyses}} the ideologies of a tense relationship. As she sings about things she would do {{if she were a}} boy, Beyoncé highlights the vulnerability of a woman and ponders how things would be different if men had women's sense of empathy. During {{the first part of the}} ballad, Beyoncé alternates between the role of her flawed partner and that of the better man she would be. In the first verse, she envisions herself impersonating her unfeeling love interest as she sings about consuming beer with other men, chasing after girls, and treating her lover cruelly, before adding that she would never be confronted for it. Beyoncé then sings the chorus, in which she gives her vision of life as a better man, [...] "I think I could understand / How it feels to love a girl / I swear I'd be a better man", <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> [...] "how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted / 'cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed".|$|E
500|$|In a train car, {{doctors in}} {{chemical}} suits are making incisions on an unseen patient's stomach; green fluid seeps {{out of the}} wounds, which heal themselves. When Dr. Eugene Openshaw arrives, he is informed that their twenty-five-year-old project is finally completed. Moments later, rebel aliens begin to appear and start burning all the doctors, the only survivor being Dr. Openshaw. The patient, Cassandra Spender, had been missing for over a year. Walter Skinner takes her son, Jeffrey Spender, to the scene, where he meets with his mother. Cassandra refuses to talk with Jeffrey {{about what happened to}} her <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> that he won't believe her. She asks for Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). [...] Spender asks Mulder to join him to meet his mother, but Mulder sees it as an attempt to entrap him. [...] Later on, Dr. Openshaw informs the Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis) about the completion of the project, saying he needs to kill his former wife since she is the first successful alien-human hybrid. The Cigarette Smoking Man's reaction leads to Dr. Openshaw's death. Meanwhile one of the Syndicate elders is killed by an alien rebel, who takes on his form.|$|E
500|$|Ryan B. Patrick of Exclaim! {{noted that}} {{songs in the}} vein of [...] "Partition" [...] {{effectively}} display genre diversity, Beyoncé's vocal range and [...] "a penchant of musical experimentation". Matthew Perpetua of BuzzFeed praised the French spoken section on [...] "Partition", comparing it to the Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie sample on [...] "Flawless" [...] as she added: [...] "It's good that these ideas aren't directly expressed by Beyoncé herself– in context, these bits are like reblogged quotes that frame her artistic intentions– <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> she doesn’t need to be so didactic when she's actually singing about sex, {{and to do so}} would defeat her point about owning her pleasures." [...] Caitlin White of The 405 wrote extensively of [...] "Partition" [...] as a song that effectively shows that Beyoncé [...] "catapults herself out of her very femininity into personhood by positioning female sexuality as a powerful, amorphous construct--one that transcends the female body even while uplifting it." [...] White concluded that the singer does not exalt herself to become [...] "the highest sex object or an egotistical pop princess" [...] but anoints herself [...] "as sexual goddess, she is at once desiring and desired, fulfilled and fulfilling". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "the spooky, almost perversely stripped-down 'Partition' reflect [...] determination, rare among superstars, to keep pushing creatively".|$|E

500|$|Admitting {{she is not}} perfect, Beyoncé {{sings the}} lines [...] "Would you rather I be a machine who doesn't notice when you late or when you lyin'?" [...] and [...] "No I'm not an angel, but at least I'm trying". In [...] "No Angel", Beyoncé {{declares}} that her partner is [...] "no angel either", remarking {{that he is not}} perfect. However, despite his imperfections, the protagonist admits she still loves him. Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "nderneath the pretty face is something complicated / I come with a side of trouble / But I know that's why you're staying" [...] in the song aimed to inform her [...] "roguish" [...] male lover. The lines of the chorus are sung by Beyoncé with pronouncing one word at a time in longer intervals. A short interlude about [...] "mov things to the bedroom" [...] is interpolated in the song. Beyoncé forgoes lyrical subtlety during that part, singing explicit lines such as [...] "Tell me do you wanna ride?" [...] and [...] "First both of my legs go back on your head, and whatever you want, yeah baby, I'm bad". Fuse's Mark Sundstrom interpreted the song's message as talking about the singer's husband Jay-Z and added [...] "She loves him more <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> him entirely, accepting he's not perfect or without a past". Complex editor Claire Lobenfeld considered its lyrical content to be about how a [...] "couple's respective internal messiness can bring them closer together".|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Goodbye Stranger", Castiel {{has been}} {{completely}} brainwashed by Naomi and has killed thousands of copies of Dean ruthlessly. Castiel is sent to find the angel tablet and tortures and kills the demons also looking for it, drawing Sam and Dean's attention. Sam and Dean track down someone who knows the location of one of Lucifer's Crypts where the angel tablet is and in ensuing scuffle, Sam ends up in trouble. Castiel saves Sam and captures one of the demons, claiming under Naomi's orders that he is searching {{for the second half}} of the demon tablet and that the demons are searching for a parchment that will allow them to translate it without a Prophet. Castiel tortures the demon who tells them where to find Meg, but kills her before she can reveal the truth to Sam and Dean. Castiel heads off alone and rescues Meg who explains what the demons really want. While Naomi initially wants her killed to prevent that, Castiel is able to make a case to keep her alive. The group then go to the warehouse where the crypt is and before heading inside with Dean, Castiel reveals that Sam is damaged by his trials on a level that even Castiel can't fix. Castiel and Dean locate the angel tablet and Castiel has to have Dean get it as it is warded against angels. However, Naomi orders Castiel to kill Dean and though he fights it, he has no control over his actions. As he is about to kill him, Dean manages to break through to Castiel's heart and he breaks free of Naomi's influence. He picks up the angel tablet which completely severs Naomi's connection to and control over him. Castiel heals Dean and explains what happened, but senses that he must now protect the tablet from everyone, even Dean. Castiel is later seen traveling on a bus to an unknown destination with the tablet. Despite losing the tablet, Naomi is somewhat satisfied as according to her, Castiel is doing what he is supposed to be doing. Naomi later comes to Dean. [...] In an attempt to gain his trust, presumably <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> Castiel is one of his weak spots, she lies to Dean about Castiel and claims that he misinterpreted everything she has done and is still insane. Dean, of course, doesn't believe her. Despite this, Castiel is eventually captured by Naomi's forces, but the angel tablet is claimed by Crowley after one of Naomi's angels betrays their location, although this gives Castiel time to escape and reunite with the Winchesters after killing the angel guarding him.|$|E

Throughout the play, Ann is often {{referred}} to as pretty, beautiful, and intelligent-looking and as [...] "Annie". She had a relationship with Larry Keller before his disappearance, and has since moved on <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> the truth of his fate. She hopes that the Kellers will consent to her marriage to Larry's brother, Chris, with whom she has corresponded by mail for two years. Ann soon finds out that the neighbors all believe that Joe is guilty, and eventually finds out the truth after a visit from her older brother George. Ann is the knowledge-bearer in the play: finally, unable to convince Kate that Larry is gone forever, Ann reveals a letter from Larry stating his intention to commit suicide having learned of his father’s implied guilt.|$|E

2500|$|Lopez {{has been}} {{influenced}} by artists such as Tina Turner, James Brown, Michael Jackson, Madonna and Barbra Streisand. She credited Rita Moreno's performance in the 1961 musical film West Side Story as a major inspiration. Critics have considered Lopez's voice to be limited, and obscured by the production of her music, while remaining [...] "radio-friendly". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone observed: [...] "Instead of strained vocal pyrotechnics, Lopez sticks to the understated R murmur of a round-the-way superstar who doesn't need to belt <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> you're already paying attention [...] She makes a little va-va {{and a whole lot}} of voom go a long way." [...] Meanwhile, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called her voice [...] "slight" [...] and wrote: [...] "Lopez was never, ever about singing; she was about style". Entertainment Weekly criticized her vocal performance for lacking the trademark [...] "husky-voiced voluptuousness" [...] she has in her films. The Baltimore Sun regards Lopez as having a [...] "breathy" [...] stylistic range, but lacking personality.|$|E

However, the Soviet {{judge on the}} panel, Nellie Kim, gave her a 9.8. On her second vault, Silivaș took a hop on her landing; all six judges gave her 9.9s. Silivaș was visibly upset after Shushunova's scores were posted and at the medal ceremony; {{according to a report}} in International Gymnast, she said, [...] "After my last vault, I thought maybe I should be the champion." [...] However, she did not argue the results publicly. Her former coach, Bela Károlyi, noted, [...] "This kid had the honesty and decency to shut up. She didn’t want to say 'I’m better' <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> Shushunova is the Olympic champion, but she couldn’t praise a rival. So she just didn’t say a word.

He can't let that go and they can't really do anything without each other so it's a really interesting thing." [...] Her character also forms a relationship with Abe Sapien, and Walton noted their similarities, [...] "They are both slightly lost souls and they understand each other." [...] Walton spoke of her character's sense of purpose, [...] "She feels very strongly about what she has to do in the film, and then her absolute connection and love for the Earth and what we are given. That's what she's here to protect... Her relationship with her brother, and how he is almost a part of her but she has to break away and will {{do whatever it takes to}} stop him from achieving what he wants to achieve, which is the mass destruction of mankind." ...|$|E
