[...] It goes from screaming heavy metal to techno dance, to Country and Western; there's even a flamenco hootenanny where everyone comes down front, beats on logs and plays acoustic guitars and pennywhistles. Then {{it goes back to}} 'Holiday' which is an old dance number. It keeps you steppin'. Madonna sings everything live. She's <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> from the beginning of her career, even with all the athletic dancing. She's a hard worker and she expects everybody else to work as hard or harder.

2500|$|Boardman {{competed with}} Graeme Obree {{for the hour}} record using radically {{modified}} time-trial bikes, beating each other's records in turn; in one eight-month period in 1994 the record fell four times. Boardman won fame by winning the prologue of the 1994 Tour de France with {{what was then the}} fastest time ever recorded. In the process he caught Luc Leblanc, who had previously been dismissive about Boardman's 1993 hour record, claiming that it could probably be beaten by half the professional peloton. However he subsequently lost the yellow jersey in a team time trial. He was hailed as the UK's future Tour de France winner, despite his own insistence that it was a long shot. [...] After retirement he said {{he was not able to}} recover from the rigours of stage racing due to a low hormone profile. [...] "I've always had it, it's probably <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> since I was born, but because of the type of racing that I did in the past, it was not a problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lusitania left Britain on 21 October 1826 for a whaling {{voyage to}} Timor. Her owner was Thomas Sturge & Co., and her master was Robert Ross. She was at St Iago, Cape Verde, on 5 December. She sighted the Australian coast near Shark Bay on 21 April 1827. By 20 May {{she was at}} Timor, where she landed five Dutch missionaries. A few days later, on 1 June, Lusitania was at Coupang. Between 21 and 25 November 1828 and 2 February 1829 she was whaling off New Guinea. In November 1828 she was at Saint George's Channel (Papua New Guinea), where she {{encountered}} many [...] "old friends" [...] among the locals, suggesting that she had <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> before. On 2 February she spoke Cyrus. Nine days later Lusitania was at Carteret Bay, where she traded with islanders who had come some distance overland to trade a hog for an old whaling lance. Lusitania was again at Coupang on 27 April. By 1829 illness aboard Lusitania {{was so bad that}} she had to return home. She returned via Delagoa Bay and the Cape of Good Hope. She returned to Britain on 26 January 1830 with 500 casks and 36 tanks of whale oil.|$|E
