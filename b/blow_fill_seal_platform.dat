40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} packaging {{market is}} constantly advancing and has experienced annual growth {{of at least}} five percent per annum {{in the past few}} years. The market is now reckoned to be worth over $ 20 billion a year. As with most other packaged goods, pharmaceuticals need reliable and speedy packaging solutions that deliver a combination of product protection, quality, tamper evidence, patient comfort and security needs. Constant innovations in the pharmaceuticals themselves such as, <b>blow</b> <b>fill</b> <b>seal</b> (BFS) vials, anti-counterfeit measures, plasma impulse chemical vapor deposition (PICVD) coating technology, snap off ampoules, unit dose vials, two-in-one prefilled vial design, prefilled syringes and child-resistant packs have a direct impact on the packaging. The review details several of the recent pharmaceutical packaging trends that are impacting packaging industry, and offers some predictions for the future...|$|R

5000|$|In the {{production}} cycle, a work order is issued {{to make the}} product in bulk. Separate pack orders are issued to signify how the bulk material is to be containerized and shipped to the customer. This is important in process industries which make “brite” stock or private labels. For example, large grocery chains sell products, such as soups, soda, and meats, under their own brand names, hence [...] "private labels". But these chains do not have their own manufacturing plants; they contract for these products. In the case of soups, process manufacturers create and warehouse nondescript, unlabeled (hence “brite”) aluminum cans of soup. (Since the cans are <b>filled,</b> <b>sealed,</b> and then cooked under pressure, their shelf life is long.) ...|$|R
