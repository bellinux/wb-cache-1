500|$|In 1931, Yost told Grantland Rice that {{he still}} {{considered}} the 1925 team {{to be better than}} his [...] "Point-a-Minute" [...] from the early 1900s: [...] "I still think the best team I ever coached was the 1925 bunch. [...] They had everything. [...] Those early teams had speed and power. [...] But the game was simpler then. [...] That 1925 bunch, which included Friedman and Oosterbaan, could run an end, buck a line, throw passes, kick, <b>block,</b> <b>tackle,</b> think, and do about everything needed on a football field to gain ground and keep other people from gaining ground. [...] Don't forget about that 1925 team that our opponents had a hard time making first downs, much less winning the game." ...|$|E

Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. <b>Block</b> <b>tackle</b> and a strangling pulley will bring your lion to heel, {{no matter how}} fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares) I possess the Indian sign.

60|$|In {{the boat}} which soon came {{alongside}} was a fisherman who {{had met with}} a bad accident some days before. A <b>block</b> <b>tackle</b> from aloft had fallen {{on his head and}} cut it severely. His mates had bound it up in rough-and-ready fashion; but the wound had bled freely, and the clotted blood still hung about his hair. Latterly the wound had festered, and gave him agonising pain. His comrades being utterly ignorant as to the proper treatment, could do nothing for him. Indeed, the only effectual thing that could be done was to send the poor man home. This sudden and unexpected appearance of one of the mission ships was therefore hailed as a godsend, for it was well-known that these vessels contained medicines, and it was believed that their skippers were more or less instructed in the healing art. In this belief they were right; for in addition to the well-appointed medicine-chest, each vessel has a skipper who undergoes a certain amount of instruction, and possesses a practical and plain book of directions specially prepared {{under the supervision of the}} Board of Trade for the use of captains at sea.|$|E
60|$|Jack {{threw off}} his coat, {{and began to}} work like a hero--as he was. The others {{followed}} his example; {{and the result was}} that when the tide rose to its full height the sloop was freed of all the rubbish that had collected round the hull; the <b>block</b> <b>tackle</b> was affixed to the mast; the rope attached to a tree {{on the opposite side of}} the creek; and the party were ready to haul. But although they hauled until their sinews cracked, and the large veins of their necks and foreheads swelled almost to bursting, the sloop did not move an inch. The tide began to fall, and in a few minutes that opportunity was gone. There were not many such tides to count on, so Jack applied all his energies and ingenuity to the work. By the time the next tide rose they had felled two large pines, and applied them to the side of the vessel. Two of the party swung at the ends of these; the other two hauled on the block-tackle. This time the sloop moved a little at the full flood; but the moment of hope soon passed, and the end was not yet attained.|$|E
6000|$|During {{all this}} time the young doctor led a busy life. He {{was one of those}} active, intelligent, inquiring spirits which cannot rest. To acquire {{information}} was with him not a duty, but a pleasure. Before he had been many days at sea he knew the name and use of every rope, sail, <b>block,</b> <b>tackle,</b> and spar in the ship, and made himself quite a favourite with the men by the earnestness with which he questioned them in regard to nautical matters and their own personal experiences. George Goff, the sail-maker, said he [...] "was a fust-rate feller;" [...] and Larry O'Hale, the cook, declared, [...] "he was a trump intirely, an' ought to have been born an Irishman." [...] Moreover, the affections of long Mr Cupples (as the first mate was styled by the men) were quite won by the way in which he laboured to understand the use of the sextant, and other matters connected with the mysteries of navigation; and stout Jonathan Dall, the captain, was overjoyed when he discovered that he was a good player on the violin, of which instrument he was passionately fond. In short, Will Osten became a general favourite on board the Foam, and the regard of all, from the cabin-boy to the captain, deepened into respect when they found that, although only an advanced student and, [...] "not quite a doctor," [...] he treated their few ailments with success, and acted his part with much self-possession, gentleness, and precision.|$|E
2500|$|A {{point on}} the Palo Colorado Road is still nicknamed [...] "The Hoist" [...] because of the very steep road which {{required}} wagon-loads of tanbark and lumber to be hoisted by <b>block</b> and <b>tackle</b> hitched to oxen.

During the game's final seconds, William & Mary quarterback Tom Rozantz broke loose {{and ran for the}} end zone. Jim Johnson, {{described}} by The Virginian Pilot as [...] "a portly 65-year-old gentleman in a raincoat", ran from the sidelines and threw a <b>block</b> <b>tackle</b> on Rozantz before he could score the winning touchdown. The unusual turn of events silenced the screaming William & Mary fans, and the officials gathered to discuss their course of action. After deliberation, the play was ruled a touchdown.|$|E

50|$|Kamdjo {{signed for}} League Two club Barnet on a one-year {{contract}} on 9 August 2009, after being on trial following his release from Reading and his subsequent trial at Cheltenham. Manager Ian Hendon handed Kamdjo his first-team debut on 22 August 2009, in the League Two 1-0 away win over Torquay United. He featured at centre back due to an injury crisis at the North London club. He featured in the first team throughout September, October and November, but faced a lengthy spell out until late February 2010 when he required surgery after rupturing medial collateral ligaments and cartilage damage in a <b>block</b> <b>tackle</b> in the match against Hereford United. He made his return to first team action in February 2010 in a 2-0 win over Port Vale. Kamdjo featured in seven more matches {{in the remainder of}} 2009-10, which included being sent off against Accrington Stanley for a professional foul, conceding a penalty.|$|E

30|$|Hip {{adductor}}s comprise, from lateral to medial, the pectineus, the adductors (longus, brevis, and magnus) and the gracilis. Of this group, the adductor longus is {{the most}} commonly injured [19]. This muscle {{is thought to be}} most susceptible to overstretching during such movements as lunging for a ball or sidestepping an opponent during a football or a rugby match. Injury may also be caused by sudden resistance to a strong adduction force, such as an opponent blocking forceful hip adduction in a <b>block</b> <b>tackle</b> [19].|$|E
