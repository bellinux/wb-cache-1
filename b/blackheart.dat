5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio {{began to think}} of a supernatural spin on the pirate genre. Walt Disney Pictures had Jay Wolpert write a script based on the ride in 2001, which was based on a story created by the {{executives}} Brigham Taylor, Michael Haynes, and Josh Harmon. This story featured Will Turner as a prison guard who releases Sparrow to rescue Elizabeth, who is being held for ransom money by Captain <b>Blackheart.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the heavy}} {{forestation}} in the area, sawmilling was an important and early industry, starting in the 1830s. In the early 20th century, there were around 20 sawmills in Meander and the surrounding localities. Due to a move towards closer settlement—smaller land plots and resulting greater population density—demand for timber in Meander increased and new sawmills were built in Meander in the 1910s and 1920s. Some of these mills continued into the late 20th century. Sawmilling later declined, partly {{due to lack of}} timber. Timberworld is the only remaining sawmill, though this is not its only business. It opened in 1985 as a sawmill supplying local Australian blackwood, myrtle beach and <b>Blackheart</b> Sassafras, originally operating from the former Baptist Church building. From 1990 it was owned and run by Kerin Booth and Kim Booth and it relocated to the former site of the Cummings Bros sawmill. Kim Booth, leader of the Tasmanian Greens, later passed management of the company to his son, Bronte. At one time Timberworld employed 30 people. The company now focuses on supply of prefabricated homes.|$|E

25|$|Phoenix {{appears in}} , voiced by Sarah Waits. She is a NPC for the PS2, Xbox, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii and PSP versions, {{and is a}} striker {{character}} in the Game Boy Advance version. In the PC and next-gen console versions, she is initially kidnapped by Arcade putting her under mind control and forces her to battle the player's team. After she is rescued, she assists the player's mission to rescue Nightcrawler from Mephisto's realm, only to be captured by <b>Blackheart</b> in the process. After defeating <b>Blackheart,</b> the player has the choice to save either Jean or Nightcrawler, since saving one results in the other's death. If Nightcrawler was rescued, then Jean will be resurrected by Mephisto (this will occur during the game). After you defeat Phoenix during the fight against Mephisto, Jean Grey-Summers dismisses herself as an echo of her past self and sacrifices her life to defeat Mephisto. In {{the end of the}} game, it is revealed if the player let Jean die, she will return as the Dark Phoenix and exact her revenge on those who did not save her. On a side note, she has special dialogue with Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Invisible Woman, and Cyclops. On the game's PC Version, Jean is available as a playable Mod character from Marvel Mods. There are several versions of Jean which give her different powersets. These include powersets from the 1990s, Morrison's Run, current Phoenix, Dark Phoenix, and Goblin Queen. She also has powersets based on her XML2 and MUA2 (both the Xbox 360/PS3 and the PSP/PS2/WII) versions. She has many costumes including all her Phoenix costumes, Marvel Girl, Original X-Men, First Class, Black Queen, Maddie Pryor, AOA, Ultimate, 1990s, Here Comes Tomorrow, New X-Men, Evolution, Movie, X-Factor, as well as many custom costumes. On PC mod patch provided by Marvel Mods that both Jean Grey and Nightcrawler can be saved from the Void by a telekinetic user (mainly Magneto by default), then both Jean and Nightcrawler manage to catch up with their four allies, whose having a trouble defeating Mephisto due to his realm is a source of his unlimited power, leaving Jean, whose Phoenix Force can match Mephisto's power finishes the demon lord for good, and with the two X-Men are finally returned safely.|$|E
25|$|Upon arriving, minions of Mephisto kidnap Jean Grey and Nightcrawler. <b>Blackheart,</b> Mephisto's son, {{puts them}} in {{separate}} cages above the Infinity Vortex, stating one must be saved and the other sacrificed before the team can defeat Mephisto. During their battle with Mephisto the sacrificed hero returns, resurrected by Mephisto, but now under his control. As a final effort, the resurrected hero sacrifices their life to defeat Mephisto and allow the team to escape. Meanwhile, in Asgard, a massive army of Super Soldiers attacks and imprisons the Asgardian gods. The heroes travel to Valhalla to liberate it from its invading force and free Heimdall (who is guarded by Rhino and Shocker), Tyr (who is guarded by Scorpion and Lizard), and Balder (who is guarded by Enchantress and Executioner). Then they fight the Wrecking Crew to open Bifrost Bridge in order for reinforcements to arrive. Looking for Odin in Niffleheim following a fight with Kurse and Ulik, they find his shattered Twilight Sword and learn from Ymir that Doctor Doom and Loki have taken Odin to Raven's Spire. After Loki is seemingly defeated at Raven's Spire, the team frees the Destroyer Armor to use against Doctor Doom. Loki, disguised as Fury, reveals himself and his plot to have the heroes free the armor for nefarious purposes. As heroes defeat Loki and the armor, Doctor Doom appears and reveals that he has stolen Odin's power. He uses it to attempt to eliminate the heroes, but Uatu the Watcher saves them and transports them to the Inhumans' base on the moon.|$|E
500|$|Bart names his new {{elephant}} Stampy {{and ties}} {{him to a}} post in the backyard. Lisa begins complaining that keeping an elephant as a pet is cruel, while Homer is concerned that Stampy will eat him out of house and home. In an effort to offset food costs, Bart and Homer exhibit Stampy by charging customers to pet and ride him, but they fail to {{make enough money to}} cover the elephant's food costs for one day. Homer and Marge decide that their house is unsuitable for an elephant to live in, and that Stampy is way too expensive to maintain as a pet, and tell the children the elephant must go. The family is visited by a representative of a game reserve, who says their acres of open land similar to African Savannah would be a good habitat for the elephant to live in. However, as the family is pondering what to do about Stampy, a wildlife poacher named Mr. <b>Blackheart</b> offers to buy Stampy. Homer wants to take the money, but Lisa is against the idea — particularly since Mr. <b>Blackheart</b> openly admits he plans to have Stampy killed for his ivory tusks. Just as Homer and Mr. <b>Blackheart</b> reach a deal, [...] Stampy and Bart run off, wreaking havoc throughout Springfield, and are soon nowhere to be found. The family begins searching and finds them at the Springfield Tar Pits, where Homer gets stuck in one of the tar pits. Homer is freed by Stampy, and gratefully agrees to donate the elephant to a wildlife reserve.|$|E
