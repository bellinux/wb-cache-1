5000|$|According to the Talmud, chametz {{can only}} consist of grains <b>of</b> two <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> wheat and three <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> which begin to rise {{when exposed to}} water. The Talmud—the Jerusalem Talmud {{in regard to the}} Land of Israel and the Babylonian Talmud in regard to the Persian Empire—lists the {{following}} five grain varieties as the only ones who do so: חיטים Ḥittim, כוסמין Kusmin, שעורים Se’orim, שיבולת שועל Shibbolet shual, and שיפון Shippon (shifon). After that the Talmud groups them into two <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> wheat Triticum (חיטים Ḥittim, כוסמין Kusmin) and three <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> Hordeum (שעורים Se’orim, שיבולת שועל Shibbolet shual, and שיפון Shippon shifon). Since European medieval times, the following translations are widely accepted in Orthodox Jewry: חיטים Ḥittim-wheat, כוסמין Kusmin-spelt, שעורים Se’orim-barley, שיבולת שועל Shibbolet shual-oats, and שיפון Shippon (shifon)-rye. Note: the latter types of grain, oats and rye, normally are not cultivated in the hot, dry subtropical climate, but in the colder, wetter temperate climate.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} the variability of the quantity of non-starch polysaccharides in grain malting spring barley (Bojos, Kangoo, Laudis 550, Malz, Sebastian Xanadu), winter barley (Wintmalt) non- malting <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> winter <b>barley</b> (Jup, Lester, Nero), spring barley (Azita, Tocada, Wiebke) and food suitable varieties spring barley (Cesar AF, AF Lucius). Samples <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> grains were detected on the quantity of pentosans and beta-glucans. Pentosans were determined by the Douglas method. Beta-glucan content in grain by FIA (Flow Injection Analysis). The influence factors on the content of pentosans and beta-glucans between varieties have been tested at the 5 % level of conclusiveness. The quantity of pentosanes in the grain was in the range from 2. 28 to 5. 95 %. The lowest content of pentosans was found in malting <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> spring <b>barley</b> Sebastian, the highest content by winter barley varieties Nero.

25|$|Two <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> were cultivated: two-rowed and six-rowed. Two-rowed barley was the older, hulled form; six-rowed barley was unhulled {{and easier}} to thresh, and since the kernels {{remained}} intact, store for longer periods. Hulled barley was thus the prevalent type during the Iron Age, but gruels made from it {{must have had a}} gritty taste due to the barley’s tough outer layers.|$|R

40|$|Phytotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> {{extracts}} (Hordeum vulgare L.) on {{wild oat}} (Avena ludoviciana Durieu) was investigated. Water extracts five <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> were bioassayed on germination and seedling growth of wild-oat {{to test the}} heterotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> on wild-oat, study the dynamics of allelopathic potential over four growth stages and identify the most allelopathic plant part <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> in each stage. Whole barley plants were extracted at growth stage 4 (stems not developed enough), whilst for the following growth stages roots, stems, panicles and leaves were extracted separately. Seedling growth bioassays demonstrated that the wild-oat responded differently to the allelopathic potential <b>of</b> <b>barley.</b> For wild-oat radical growth and coleoptile growth were more depressed than germination, though. The allelopathic potential <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> plant parts was not stable over its life cycle for wild-oat. Leaves and stems were the most phytotoxic barley plant parts for wild-oat in the all stages. Among the varieties Eizeh appeared as the best one showing toxicity to seed germination of wild oat at its stage 4 and 8. Results suggested that the response by wild-oat varied depending on the source of allelochemicals (plant part) and the growth stage <b>of</b> the <b>barley</b> plant and kind <b>of</b> <b>variety.</b> The results leaded to conclude that Eizeh <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> was good to grow as it has good check on seed germination of wild oat plants {{as well as it}} also retarded the growth of root and shoot length of oat...|$|R

2500|$|Wild barley has a brittle spike; upon maturity, the spikelets separate, facilitating seed dispersal. [...] Domesticated barley has nonshattering spikes, {{making it}} much easier to harvest the mature ears. [...] The nonshattering {{condition}} is caused by a mutation in one of two tightly linked genes known as Bt1 and Bt2; many cultivars possess both mutations. The nonshattering condition is recessive, so <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> that exhibit this condition are homozygous for the mutant allele.|$|R
