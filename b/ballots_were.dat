5|$|After regular <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> counted, Pryce led Kilroy by over 3,500 votes {{with about}} 19,000 {{provisional}} ballots outstanding. The Franklin county absentee and provisional <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> not counted until approximately {{two weeks after}} the election. On Monday November 27, nearly three weeks after Election Day, Pryce was declared the winner by a 1,054 vote margin that mandated a recount. After two recounts and all of the votes were counted, Congresswoman Deborah Pryce (R) prevailed over Democratic challenger Mary Jo Kilroy. The Franklin County Board of Elections announced the results Monday morning December 11, 2006. Pryce (R) gained 25 votes and Kilroy (D) gained 18 votes in the recount of votes in Franklin, Union, and Madison Counties in Ohio. Pryce won with 50.20% of the vote by a 110,739–109,677 margin. Kilroy felt her campaign was slowed by the early candidacy of fellow Franklin County Commissioner Paula Brooks, who eventually withdrew. Immediately after losing in 2006, she announced she would recontest the seat in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Four <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> {{taken on}} the {{afternoon}} of June 11, and they revealed a deadlock. With 493 votes needed to nominate, Wood was the closest with 314; Lowdon had 289. The best Harding had done was 65. Chairman Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, the Senate Majority Leader, adjourned the convention about 7p.m.|$|E
5|$|The {{legality}} of about 600 absentee <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> contested during the count, including Senator Gillibrand's ballot. By April 23, Murphy was ahead by 401 votes, and Tedisco conceded the following day. Murphy {{was sworn in}} on April 29. The official results came out in May and had Murphy winning the election with 80,833 votes (50.23%) against Tedisco's 80,107 votes (49.77%).|$|E
50|$|First <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> {{conducted}} October 24, 1998; second <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> conducted November 14, 1998.|$|R
5000|$|The Absentee Ballot Track, Receive and Confirm (TRAC) Act (...) {{which gives}} states grant money {{to set up}} a system to track {{absentee}} ballots. Through the system, a voter will be able to find out if a <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> mailed, if their completed <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> received, and if their <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> counted.|$|R
50|$|If all the <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> {{divided into}} {{separate}} races {{and the overall}} ranking for the separate races are the same, then the same ranking occurs when all the <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> combined.|$|R
5|$|Diefenbaker {{chose not}} to stand for the House of Commons in the 1930 federal election, citing health reasons. The Conservatives gained a {{majority}} in the election, and party leader R. B. Bennett became Prime Minister. Diefenbaker continued a high-profile legal practice, and in 1933, ran for mayor of Prince Albert. He was defeated by 48 votes in an election in which over 2,000 <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> cast.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Quebec Superior Court denied an {{application}} by Alliance Quebec that attempted {{to force the}} DGEQ to give access to all 5 million ballots, ruling that the only authority that could do so expired in 1996. The referendum <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> incinerated in 2008 after appeals were exhausted. In May 2005, former PQ Cabinet minister Richard Le Hir said that the PQ coordinated the ballot rejections, which PQ officials denied.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 2009, Coleman's {{campaign}} {{filed an}} election contest, {{which led to}} a trial before a three-judge panel. The trial ended on April 7, when the panel ruled that 351 of 387 disputed absentee <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> incorrectly rejected and ordered them counted. Counting those ballots raised Franken's lead to 312 votes. Coleman appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court on April 20. On April 24, the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Oral arguments were conducted on June 1.|$|E
50|$|Mail <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> {{similar in}} many respects to an {{absentee}} <b>ballot.</b> However they <b>are</b> used for Mailing Precincts where on Election Day no polling place is opened for a specific precinct. In Oregon, Washington, and Colorado, all <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> delivered through the mail.|$|R
50|$|If all <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> {{counted as}} cast and cast as intended, then all <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> counted as intended. Therefore, the {{integrity}} of the election can be proven to a very high probability.|$|R
50|$|Chaum's team {{subsequently}} developed Punchscan, {{which has}} stronger security properties and uses simpler paper ballots. The paper <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> voted {{on and then}} a privacy-preserving portion of the <b>ballot</b> <b>is</b> scanned by an optical scanner.|$|R
5|$|On November 6, 1860, Lincoln {{was elected}} the 16th {{president}} of the United States, beating Douglas, Breckinridge, and Bell. He was the first president from the Republican Party. His victory was entirely due {{to the strength of}} his support in the North and West; no <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states.|$|E
5|$|Randall spent early December {{in conference}} with Tilden while {{committees}} examined the votes from the disputed states. The counts of the disputed <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> inconclusive, {{with each of}} the states in question producing two sets of returns: one signed by Democratic officials, the other by Republicans, each claiming victory for their man. By January 1877, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which would be authorized to determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes.|$|E
5|$|The {{color of}} the smoke {{indicates}} the results to the people assembled in St Peter's Square. Dark smoke (fumata nera) indicates that the ballot {{did not result in}} an election, while white smoke (fumata bianca) announces that a new pope was chosen. Originally, in the event a pope was not elected, damp straw was added to the fire to create dark smoke. In the event a new pope was elected, the <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> burned alone, creating white smoke.|$|E
50|$|If all the <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> {{divided into}} {{separate}} races and choice X {{is identified as}} the most popular in every such race, then choice X {{is the most popular}} when all the <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> combined.|$|R
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} inaccurately claimed that absentee <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> not counted unless {{the race is}} close; in fact, all valid absentee <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> counted even if they will not affect {{the outcome of the}} election.|$|R
50|$|Prior to an election, {{twice as}} many <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> {{produced}} as the number intended {{to use in the}} election. Half of these <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> selected randomly (or each candidate could choose a fraction of the ballots) and opened. The rows in the database corresponding to these selected <b>ballots</b> can <b>be</b> checked to ensure the calculations are correct and not tampered with. Since the election authority does not know a priori which <b>ballots</b> will <b>be</b> selected, passing this audit means the database is well formed with a very high probability. Furthermore, the <b>ballots</b> can <b>be</b> checked against their commitments to ensure with high probability that the <b>ballot</b> commitments <b>are</b> correct.|$|R
5|$|The {{race was}} so close that one early vote count had the {{candidates}} tied at 77,225 votes each. Absentee ballots decided the election; <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> accepted until April 13. While Tedisco had been ahead in early counts, by April 10 Murphy was leading, and by April 23 Murphy had a 401-vote advantage. Tedisco conceded the race the following day, and Murphy was sworn in on April 29. Democratic electoral successes in November 2008 and Murphy's clear support of the stimulus package were credited for his success.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} elections {{took place}} in December 1944, and were broadly considered free and fair, although only literate men were given the vote. Unlike in similar historical situations, none of the junta members stood for election. Arévalo's closest challenger was Adrián Recinos, whose campaign included a number of individuals identified with the Ubico regime. The <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> tallied on 19 December 1944, and Arévalo won in a landslide, receiving {{more than four times}} as many ballots as the other candidates combined.|$|E
5|$|Two Deputy Returning Officers {{were charged}} by the DGEQ with violating {{elections}} laws, but in 1996 were found not guilty (a decision upheld by the Quebec Court of Appeal), after {{it was found that}} the <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> not rejected in a fraudulent or irregular manner, and that there was no proof of conspiracy. A Quebec Court judge acquitted a Deputy Returning Officer charged with illegally rejecting 53% of the ballots cast at his Chomedey polling district.|$|E
25|$|One {{round of}} <b>balloting</b> <b>was</b> to held the first evening. Then <b>balloting</b> <b>was</b> to {{continue}} {{until a new}} Pope was elected, with two ballots each morning and two each afternoon. The traditional procedure <b>is</b> that the <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> burned, in times past reinforced by adding handfuls of dry or damp straw, to produce white smoke for a conclusive vote or black smoke for an inconclusive one. The straw {{had been replaced by}} chemically produced smoke. The <b>ballot</b> slips <b>were</b> to be burned at noon and 7pm Rome time (10:00 and 17:00 UTC) each day.|$|R
50|$|Provisional <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> for would-be {{voters who}} assert {{that they are}} {{registered}} but whose names cannot {{be found in the}} list available at the polling place. The voter completes a written <b>ballot,</b> which <b>is</b> placed in a sealed envelope. The <b>ballot</b> <b>is</b> opened and counted only if the voter is subsequently found to be registered.|$|R
50|$|Graham withdrew while {{voting for}} the third <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> underway. McKenzie withdrew while {{voting for the}} fourth <b>ballot</b> <b>was</b> in process. Votes were not counted for either one, and the {{convention}} proceeded directly to the fifth ballot.|$|R
5|$|All ballots, {{absentee}} ballot envelopes, and voting machines were impounded under a court injunction sought by state Republicans. Under the court order, absentee <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> counted in central locations rather than individual precincts. Of the 10,000 {{absentee ballot}}s {{sent out to}} voters, 6,000 were returned. Absentee ballots mailed within the United States had to be received by April 7 to be counted. The deadline for overseas (including military) ballots was extended to April 13 after the United States Department of Justice sued the state to ensure {{they would have a}} reasonable chance of being counted. Counting of the absentee ballots due by April 7 began on April 8 under a New York State Supreme Court ruling sought by Murphy's campaign.|$|E
5|$|In the 2013 gubernatorial election, Democrat Barbara Buono {{received}} 57.8% of {{the vote}} (6,197 cast), ahead of Republican Chris Christie with 41.4% (4,439 votes), and other candidates with 0.8% (90 votes), among the 10,991 ballots cast by the township's 25,615 registered voters (265 <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> spoiled), for a turnout of 42.9%. In the 2009 gubernatorial election, Democrat Jon Corzine received 9,347 ballots cast (71.8% vs. 48.0% countywide), ahead of Republican Chris Christie with 3,242 votes (24.9% vs. 45.8%), Independent Chris Daggett with 343 votes (2.6% vs. 4.7%) and other candidates with 41 votes (0.3% vs. 0.5%), among the 13,027 ballots cast by the township's 25,513 registered voters, yielding a 51.1% turnout (vs. 50.0% in the county).|$|E

In the 2009 Gubernatorial Election, Democrat Jon Corzine received 90.2% {{of the vote}} (36,637 ballots cast), ahead of Republican Chris Christie who received 8.3% of the vote (3,355 votes), with 40,613 of the city's 134,195 registered voters (30.3%) participating.|$|E
50|$|Mail-in <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> {{an option}} for Overseas Filipinos in select {{countries}} only. The general practise for local and overseas absentee voting in Philippine elections requires that <b>ballots</b> <b>be</b> cast in person at select polling places, such as a consulate office.|$|R
5000|$|Once received, an Elections Official at the {{elections}} office where the <b>ballot</b> <b>is</b> received will compare the signature {{on the ballot}} return envelope to the signature on the voter registration card to verify that the voter is registered to vote. Once verified, the secrecy envelope containing the actual <b>ballot</b> <b>is</b> removed and polled with the other ballots. Once the [...] "polls" [...] close at 8pm on Election Day, the <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> removed from their secrecy envelopes and counted.|$|R
50|$|Elections in South Korea use a central-count {{system with}} optical {{scanners}} at each regional election office. A separate <b>ballot</b> paper <b>is</b> used for each office being contested, and votes are cast using red ink and a rubber stamp. <b>Ballots</b> <b>are</b> similar {{in size to}} paper currency, and the optical scanners resemble cash sorter machines. After the <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> sorted, stacks of <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> counted using machines resembling currency counting machines. The Korean system has been praised {{as a model of}} best practice, but it has also been the subject of controversy, including questions about its legality and allegations of rigged counting in 2012.|$|R
5|$|A Historical Overview Committee of sportswriters {{appointed}} by the BBWAA's Board of Directors met to develop a ballot of 10 managers and umpires. The managers/umpires list was then submitted to a panel composed of Hall of Fame members, executives and veteran media members for a final vote. A separate ballot of 10 executives was developed by a panel including executives, players and writers, which was the same committee which finally voted in that area. The final <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> released in November 2009. Each panel member was allowed to vote for up to four individuals on each ballot, and each candidate who received 75% of the vote from either panel was elected; therefore, a maximum of five inductions were possible from each ballot. Voting was conducted at baseball's winter meetings in Indianapolis on December 6, 2009, with the results announced the next day; {{as was the case}} with the 2008 class of inductees, the Committee met to discuss the candidates, although the previous three elections had been conducted by mail.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge asked James Clay {{to protect}} his {{interests}} at the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina. Clay, Lazarus Powell, William Preston, Henry Cornelius Burnett, and James B. Beck desired to nominate Breckinridge for president, but in a compromise with Kentucky's Douglas backers, the delegation went to Charleston committed to former Treasury Secretary James Guthrie of Louisville. Fifty Southern Democrats, upset at the convention's refusal to include slavery protection in the party's platform, {{walked out of the}} convention; the remaining delegates decided that nominations required a two-thirds majority of the original 303 delegates. For 35 ballots, Douglas ran well ahead of Guthrie but short of the needed majority. Arkansas's lone remaining delegate nominated Breckinridge, but Beck asked that the nomination be withdrawn because Breckinridge refused to compete with Guthrie. Twenty-one more <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> cast, but the convention remained deadlocked. On May 3, the convention adjourned until June 18 in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{government}} formulated procedural regulations ostensibly {{designed to}} ensure results and <b>ballots</b> <b>were</b> correctly accounted for and to prevent election fraud. In reality however, the votes were counted without independent supervision, which resulted in Diệm being credited with 98.2% of the vote. The prime minister tallied 605,025 votes in Saigon, although only 450,000 voters were registered in the capital. Diệm's tally exceeded the registration numbers in other districts. French newspapers claimed that {{only half of the}} registered voters in Saigon had actually voted, and that the rest had boycotted the election, implying that more than 60% of the votes in the capital were not authentic. Defenders of Diệm claim this was due to recently arrived, mostly Catholic, refugees from North Vietnam who voted without being enrolled, rather than large-scale ballot stuffing.|$|E
50|$|If {{no clear}} choice emerges, the elder {{committee}} {{may choose to}} table the issue for a time. However, <b>balloting</b> <b>is</b> for advisory purposes only, <b>ballots</b> <b>are</b> destroyed promptly after they are counted and the elder committee has the final responsibility for the appointment.|$|R
