5|$|Months {{after the}} hurricane, the Mexican {{government}} launched {{an investigation into}} the dam failure. In the end, La Paz recovered, though the town had to be almost entirely re-built. In 1997, Hurricane Pauline struck southern Mexico, becoming the deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the country since Liza. As of 2006, no hurricane in Baja California Sur has been as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> Liza.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone John {{extensively}} {{affected areas}} of Western Australia, but damage {{was not as}} <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> expected. Widespread power outages across the Pilbara region were caused by John. Strong winds caused minor damage to infrastructure across the coast, as well as tree damage. 140windmills were destroyed by the cyclone on the coast. Further inland, rainfall associated with the cyclone and its remnants brought flooding, which flooded 25houses and caused rivers to overflow. The system was responsible for no deaths and {{a limited amount of}} damage. After the season, the name John was retired from the Australian tropical cyclone naming list.|$|E

5|$|Following the tie to the Mark Greys, the Panhandles {{traveled}} to Lorain, Ohio, {{to play against}} the Elyria Athletics on Thanksgiving Day. The result of the game was another 0–0 tie, making it the seventh time in nine games the Panhandles were held scoreless. Chris Willis stated this tie was not as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> the previous weeks because the Athletics had old players from the Akron Indians, a winning team in the Ohio League.|$|E
5|$|However, on 15 March 2016, American comedian Jim Breuer (a {{friend of}} Johnson) {{revealed}} on his podcast that Johnson {{had received a}} second opinion on his hearing {{and it was not}} as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> initially thought. Nonetheless, Breuer mentioned that Johnson told him that he was essentially fired from AC/DC and that he hadn't heard from the band since the announcement of the tour being postponed, adding that Angus Young wants to continue the band for at least another ten years and do at least one more studio album and world tour. Breuer later clarified his comments on Facebook that did not end speculation on Johnson's future with the band.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that a prisoner serving a 27-year sentence was conducting a lone protest on the roof against conditions and was being cheered by other prisoners. The newspaper also referenced in its own report an interview with former lord chief justice Lord Woolf from {{earlier in the year}} where he described prisoners being kept in intolerable conditions–as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> {{at the time of the}} riots. Woolf recommended prisons were kept out of politics.|$|E

5|$|The {{contract}} was signed on June 15, 1866 and the expropriation {{of the first}} 1,100 houses was completed in a few months. The work began on February 13, 1867. There were several technical difficulties that delayed the covering, {{many of which were}} due to the geology of Brussels, though they were not as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> some engineers had forecast. The embezzlement scandal also caused a significant delay in construction, largely due to the change in control. The project was completed in 1871, with the municipal council ceremonially opening the reconstructed sluice gates on November 30.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{consequences for the}} county were more difficult to quantify. The financial impact on the county was estimated by the California Economic Forecast Director at $74 million if Line 901 remains dormant for three years because of the dependence of the region’s {{oil and gas industry}} to move product through this line. Workers income, property taxes, and federal royalties are reduced while the line is out of service. The impact on tourism was not as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> predicted and thousands of workers involved in the cleanup appear to have benefited some hotels.|$|E
5|$|The {{worst of}} Linda's impact was in Vietnam, where 3,111 people were killed, and damage totaled $385 million (USD). Heavy {{rainfall}} caused flooding, which {{damaged or destroyed}} about 200,000 houses and left about 383,000 people homeless. Widespread crop and transportation damage also occurred, the latter which impeded relief efforts. Several {{countries around the world}} sent relief aid, including medical teams, food, and clothing. However, the food supply and health status of the storm victims proved not as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> originally feared. Linda later struck Thailand, causing flash flooding and at least 164 deaths. The storm also affected Burma (Myanmar), Indonesia, Malaysia, and Cambodia to a lesser degree.|$|E

5|$|An off spinner, Johnson was {{a member}} of Bradman’s first-choice team, playing in four of the five Tests before being dropped for the final rubber. He also played in the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and Leveson-Gower's XI, where Australia {{selected}} their strongest possible team. However, Johnson was not prominent in the Test success, taking seven wickets at 61.00, his best result being 3/72 in the first innings of the Second Test. Among the five frontline bowlers used in four or more Tests, Lindwall, Miller, Toshack, Johnston and Johnson, the last had the worst average by a factor of almost two; Toshack averaged 33.09 and the others less than 23.50. Lindwall and Johnston took 27 wickets each, while Miller and Toshack took 13 and 11 respectively. Johnson’s economy rate was the second worst of the quintet and his strike rate of 156.86 was more than twice as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> the others, with the exception of Toshack (94.46). Johnson also had little impact with the bat, scoring 51 runs at 10.20, but he did take five catches in the slips.|$|E
5|$|While a few former bal maidens found {{alternative}} employment at local factories, and large numbers emigrated, the unemployment situation in Cornwall remained <b>bad.</b> <b>As</b> {{early as the}} 1860s, charitable schemes had begun for training former bal maidens as domestic servants, and as the textile industry of the North of England boomed a concerted {{effort was made to}} recruit Cornish women to work in the mills. Large numbers of women took up these offers; the 1891 census showed 17,757 Cornish women living in Devon (the majority working in domestic service), 10,005 in London and the surrounding suburbs of Middlesex, and 4,439 in Lancashire. In addition, the towns growing around the newly discovered mines of South Australia suffered a serious gender imbalance and made concerted efforts to recruit Cornish women.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{government}} identified basic {{supplies that}} it needed {{in response to the}} storm; those included various foods, clothing, medicine, shelter supplies, and sanitation equipment. The country made a formal request for international assistance, noting that the storm was the worst in 100years, and officials had limited resources due to the unexpected destruction. Prior to the request, the government of Switzerland sent about 500,000 Swiss francs ($360,000 USD) for immediate relief assistance. Subsequently, ten other countries sent cash or relief supplies worth $2.6 million, including medical shelters from the United States, clothing from the United Kingdom, tents from Russia, and transport goods from Japan. Red Cross workers had to travel by riverboat to bring aid to the most affected communities, due to the poor state of the roads. After two months, the Red Cross distributed 65,401 roofing sheets, 390 metric tons of rice, 11,990 mosquito nets, 6,871 blankets, 3,664 medical kits, and abundant clothing supplies to about 150,000 affected people; the supplies were purchased in Ho Chi Minh City. Eventually, the food supply and health status of the storm victims proved not as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> originally feared. After the assistance was distributed, the Red Cross shifted focus toward reconstruction. Reconstruction was slow, partly due to a slowdown in economic activity from the Vietnamese New Year. Additionally, the two primary factories responsible for making iron and construction frames were only intermittently open, due to machines failing.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E
