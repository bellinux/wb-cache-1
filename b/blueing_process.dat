50|$|Bluing {{only works}} on steel, cast iron, or {{stainless}} steel parts for protecting against corrosion. Because it changes iron into Fe3O4, {{it does not}} work on non-ferrous material. Aluminium and polymer parts cannot be blued, and no corrosion protection is provided. However, the chemicals from the <b>blueing</b> <b>process</b> can accomplish uneven staining on aluminium and polymer parts. Hot bluing should never be attempted on aluminium, as it will react violently with the bath of caustic salts, potentially causing severe chemical burns.|$|E
50|$|When {{tap water}} is not {{sufficiently}} alkaline, or is even acidic and {{is unsatisfactory for}} blueing haematoxylin, a tap water substitute consisting of 3.5 g NaHCO3 and 20 g MgSO4.7H2O in one litre of water with thymol (to inhibit formation of moulds), is used to accelerate blueing of thin paraffin sections. Addition of a trace of any alkali to tap or distilled water also provides an effective blueing solution; {{a few drops of}} strong ammonium hydroxide or of saturated aqueous lithium carbonate, added immediately before use, are sufficient for a 400 ml staining dish full of water. Use of very cold water slows down the <b>blueing</b> <b>process,</b> whereas warming accelerates it. In fact, the use of water below 10 °C for blueing sections may even produce pink artifact discolourations in the tissue.|$|E

5000|$|Rust bluing was {{developed}} between {{hot and cold}} <b>bluing</b> <b>processes.</b> It was originally used by gunsmiths in the 19th century to blue firearms prior {{to the development of}} hot <b>bluing</b> <b>processes.</b> The process was to coat the gun parts in an acid solution, let the parts rust uniformly, then immerse the parts in boiling water to stabilize the rusting process by removing any remaining residue from the applied acid solution (often nitric acid and hydrochloric acid diluted in water). Then the rust was carded (scrubbed) off, using a carding brush or wheel. A carding brush is a wire brush with very soft, thin (usually about [...]002 thick) wires. This process is repeated until the desired depth of color is achieved or the metal simply will not color any further. This {{is one of the reasons}} rust and fume bluing tend to be more rust resistant than any other method. The parts are then oiled and allowed to stand overnight. This process leaves a deep blue/black finish.|$|R
25|$|The second {{method was}} known as 'China blue' due to its {{resemblance}} to Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. Instead of using an indigo solution directly, the process involved printing the insoluble form of indigo onto the fabric. The indigo was then reduced in a sequence of baths of iron(II) sulfate, with air-oxidation between each immersion. The China <b>blue</b> <b>process</b> could make sharp designs, but it could not produce the dark hues possible with the pencil blue method.|$|R

When in combination with black Bakelite grip panels, used on some examples starting in 1941, these pistols were named the [...] "Black Widow" [...] model by a postwar US arms dealer as a marketing ploy.|$|R
50|$|The major use is in {{protecting}} {{and changing the}} color of steel, especially steel parts on firearms. The so-called cold-bluing process uses selenous acid, copper(II) nitrate, and nitric acid to change {{the color of the}} steel from silver-grey to blue-grey or black. Alternative procedures use copper sulfate and phosphoric acid instead. This process deposits a coating of copper selenide and is fundamentally different from other <b>bluing</b> <b>processes</b> which generate black iron oxide. Some older razor blades were also made of blued steel.|$|R
50|$|These {{processes}} {{were later}} abandoned by major firearm manufacturers as it often took parts days to finish completely, {{and was very}} labor-intensive. They are still sometimes used by gunsmiths to obtain an authentic finish for a period gun {{of the time that}} rust bluing was in vogue, analogous to the use of browning on earlier representative firearm replicas. Rust bluing is also used on shotgun barrels that are soldered to the rib between the barrels, as hot bluing solutions would dissolve the solder during the <b>bluing</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Primrose Works, set up near Clitheroe in Lancashire in 1801, became Thomson's, in {{partnership}} with others.

50|$|Two {{different}} methods for the direct application of indigo dye {{were developed in}} England {{in the eighteenth century}} and remained in use well into the nineteenth century. One of these, known as china blue, involved iron(II) sulfate. After printing an insoluble form of indigo onto the fabric, the indigo was reduced to leuco-indigo in a sequence of baths of ferrous sulfate (with reoxidation to indigo in air between immersions). The china <b>blue</b> <b>process</b> could make sharp designs, but it could not produce the dark hues of other methods. Sometimes, it is included in canned black olives as an artificial colorant.|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} methods of cold bluing, {{which do not}} require heat. Commercial {{products}} are widely sold in small bottles for cold bluing firearms, and these products are primarily used by individual gun owners for implementing small touch-ups to a gun's finish, to prevent a small scratch from becoming {{a major source of}} rust on a gun over time. At least one of the cold bluing solutions contains selenium dioxide, to accomplish the bluing. Cold bluing is not particularly resistant to holster wear, nor does it provide a large degree of rust resistance. It does, however, often provide an adequate cosmetic touch-up of a gun's finish when applied and additionally oiled on a regular basis, however, rust bluing small areas will often match and blend better and wear better than any cold <b>bluing</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Western {{countries}} face {{an ongoing}} threat from Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). One {{aspect of the}} response to this threat {{is the use of}} agent-based simulation to model the human networks which place IEDs. While it may not be possible to model these networks with sufficient fidelity to exactly predict IED placement, there is substantial training value in lower-fidelity simulation models which are nevertheless realistic enough to teach useful survival strategies. In this paper, we survey some relevant areas of simulation science. There are two main human aspects to IED placement. The first is motivation to place the devices, which influences the number of IEDs placed per day. Modelling motivation requires simulations incorporating attitudes and emotions within society. The second main human aspect to IED placement is cognition, which influences the choice of location for IEDs. Simulation of cognition requires modelling planning by Red forces, which takes into account an internal model of <b>Blue</b> <b>processes.</b> Modelling cognition also requires models of learning and adaptability, as Red forces create and respond to their mental representations of Blue responses. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the stable matching of two independent Poisson processes in R^d under an asymmetric color restriction. Blue points can only match to red points, while red points can match to points of either color. It is unknown whether {{there exists a}} choice of intensities of the red and <b>blue</b> <b>processes</b> under which all points are matched. We prove that for any fixed intensities, there are unmatched blue points in sufficiently high dimension. Indeed, if the ratio of red to blue intensities is ρ then the intensity of unmatched blue points converges to e^-ρ/(1 +ρ) as d→∞. We also establish analogous results for certain multi-color variants. Our proof uses stable matching on the Poisson-weighted infinite tree (PWIT), which can be analyzed via differential equations. The PWIT {{has been used in}} many settings as a scaling limit for models involving complete graphs with independent edge weights, but we believe {{that this is the first}} rigorous application to high-dimensional Euclidean space. Finally, we analyze the asymmetric matching problem under a hierarchical metric, and show that there are unmatched points for all intensities. Comment: 27 page...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to investigate vacuum influence on hide preservation time and how it affects hide structure.

The microorganisms act for all storage times, but the action is weak and has no observable influence {{on the quality of}} hide during the time period mentioned. The hide shrinkage temperature decrease is negligible, which shows that breaking of intermolecular bonds does not occur. Optical microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry also did not show any structural changes which can influence the quality of leather produced from such hide. The qualitative indexes of wet <b>blue</b> <b>processed</b> under laboratory conditions and of leather produced during industrial trials are presented.

ColeThe characteristics of the blue-sensitive process of human colour vision have been explored {{by means of the}} two-colour increment threshold technique of W. S. Stiles and the measurement of retinal directional sensitivity. The objectives were a) 	to find points of difference between the three independent blue-sensitive mechanisms π 1, π and π 3 which might lead to reasonable hypotheses concerning their physiological basis and functional role, and b) 	to establish whether the unique threshold behaviour of the <b>blue</b> <b>process</b> at the fovea is due to an absence of blue cones as Wald (1967) has concluded. It has been found that the π 3 mechanism has similar characteristics to π 1; it is absent in tritanopia, exhibits extensive complete spatial summation and has high directional sensitivity. The π 2 mechanism appears to be less directionally sensitive. Both π 1 and π 3 have been demonstrated at the central fixation area of the fovea.
