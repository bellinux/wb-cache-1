5|$|Although Amanda gains {{access to}} a revolver, a shotgun, a <b>bolt</b> <b>gun,</b> and a {{flamethrower}} {{over the course of}} the game, Alien: Isolation emphasizes evasion over direct combat by providing the player with limited ammunition. Fortunately, the player can also craft several items by collecting schematics and different kind of materials throughout the game. Items range from EMP mines to noisemakers, molotov cocktails and pipe bombs, among others. These items help the player deal with enemies and the alien. For example, the noisemaker can be used to attract enemies in one particular direction. The alien is afraid of fire, so using the flamethrower or a molotov cocktail will force it to retreat into the station's ventilation system. The player has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. Nevertheless, the player can restore lost health using medkits, which can be crafted with materials in Amanda's inventory.|$|E
25|$|On {{board the}} rocket, the {{collapse}} of the gravity field causes Toby to reveal the mind of the Beast is still possessing him as he taunts the others while breathing out fire. Rose takes Captain Zach's <b>bolt</b> <b>gun</b> and shoots out the rocket's front window, unhooking Toby's safety harness to jettison the possessed man into space towards the black hole. The cabin is sealed by automatic shields but the rocket still lacks the power to escape the gravity well. Suddenly their ride smooths out and the rocket turns away from the black hole. The Doctor contacts Captain Zach, telling him that he is towing the rocket to safety with the TARDIS. The Doctor asks for Rose and jokingly offers to trade Zach back Ida, whom he rescued from the planet caverns, for Rose. The Doctor reports he did not have time to go back and save the Ood, who were innocent victims of the Beast's possession. Once safe, the respective crews depart on their separate ways. As they return to Earth, Captain Zach reads off the list of personnel that died, including the Ood.|$|E
2500|$|The best {{dogs are}} kept for {{breeding}} {{and there are}} both industry-associated adoption groups and rescue groups that work to obtain retired racing greyhounds and place them as pets. In the United Kingdom, according to the BBC, one in four retired greyhounds finds a home as a pet. In the United States, prior {{to the formation of}} adoption groups, over 20,000 retired greyhounds a year were killed; recent estimates still number in the thousands, with the industry claiming that about 90% of National Greyhound Association-registered animals are either adopted or returned for breeding purposes (according to the industry numbers upwards of 2000 dogs are still euthanized annually in the US while anti-racing groups estimate the figure at closer to 12,000.) [...] Other greyhounds are sold to research labs, such as Liverpool university animal training school, who have received the remains of dogs killed at Manchester's Belle Vue stadium. A trainer in Lincolnshire was also exposed offering 'slow' dogs to the Liverpool school. Additionally dogs are sent to foreign racetracks such as Spain and sometimes in developing countries.

50|$|According to equine-welfare advocates, the {{physiology}} of the equine cranium {{is such that}} neither the penetrating captive <b>bolt</b> <b>gun</b> nor gunshots are reliable means of killing (or stunning) a horse; the animal may be only paralyzed. Unless properly checked for vital signs, a horse may remain conscious and experience pain during skinning and butchering.|$|E
50|$|In most {{countries}} where horses are slaughtered for food, they are processed {{in a similar}} fashion to cattle, i.e., in large-scale factory slaughter houses (abattoirs) where they are stunned with a captive <b>bolt</b> <b>gun</b> and bled to death. In countries with a less industrialized food production system, horses and other animals are slaughtered individually outdoors as needed, in the village where they will be consumed, or near to it.|$|E
50|$|In most {{countries}} where horses are slaughtered for food, they are processed in industrial abattoirs similarly to cattle. Typically, a penetrating captive <b>bolt</b> <b>gun</b> or gunshot {{is used to}} render the animal unconscious. The blow (or shot) is intended to kill the horse instantly or stun it, with exsanguination (bleeding out) conducted immediately afterwards to ensure death.

50|$|The free bolt stunner is {{used for}} the emergency, in-the-field {{euthanasia}} of large farm-animals that cannot be restrained. It differs from a true captive <b>bolt</b> <b>gun</b> in that the projectile is not retractable; it is similar in operation to a powder-actuated nail gun or conventional firearm. Capable of firing only when pressed firmly against a surface (typically the animal's forehead), the device fires a small projectile through the animal's skull. The veterinarian can then either leave the animal to die from the projectile wound, or administer lethal drugs.|$|E

5000|$|The {{film has}} been criticized for its {{unrealistic}} portrayal of rock climbing. One example is the feature of the bolt-gun which fires bolts directly into rock, forgoing the usual rock-drilling and bolt-hammering used in rock-climbing. This ignores certain material properties of rock that should cause the bolt-gun's impact site to shatter and explode with flaky projectiles. The <b>bolt</b> <b>gun</b> is considered the most serious of the film's technical inaccuracies.

50|$|The trigger {{mechanism}} is a conventional firearm trigger, but functions only {{to control the}} release mechanism for either the <b>bolt</b> (submachine <b>gun)</b> or firing pin holding mechanism (semi-auto) since the Uzi does not incorporate an internal cocking or hammer mechanism. While the open-bolt system is mechanically simpler than a closed-bolt design (e.g. Heckler & Koch MP5), it creates a noticeable delay between when the trigger is pulled and when the gun fires.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the player}} can use certain weapons to defeat enemies, Alien: Isolation emphasises evasion over direct combat by {{providing}} the player with limited ammunition. The game features four weapons that become available as the player progresses throughout the game: a revolver, a shotgun, a <b>bolt</b> <b>gun,</b> and a flamethrower. The player can also craft several items by collecting schematics and different kind of materials throughout the game. Items range from EMP mines to noisemakers, molotov cocktails and pipe bombs, among others. These items help the player deal with enemies and the alien.

50|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} rated NC-17 by the MPAA {{on account of}} its violence. Several cuts were made to almost every violent scene in the film {{in order to get}} an R rating. Several death scenes in the film were shot in slow motion and lasted several seconds; for instance {{in the beginning of the}} film the pilot of the plane shoots the co-pilot in the head in a very brief shot; in the NC-17 version, this was shot from a different angle that showed blood splattering on the window. Bootleg DVD copies taken from a timecoded VHS workprint feature the original rough cut of the film, complete with uncut violent scenes. Travers' death originally featured him being shot in the shoulder by Gabe with the <b>bolt</b> <b>gun</b> and blasted with the shotgun by Hal. This was changed to Gabe firing the gun three times, not due to censorship but because a review of the dailies caused the filmmakers to think of a somewhat slicker death.|$|E
50|$|Unintentional {{discharge}} is {{the event}} of a firearm discharging (firing) at a time not intended by the user.

40|$|Apart {{from one}} article {{published}} by Rabl and Sigrist in 1992 (Rechtsmedizin 2 : 156 - 158), {{there are no}} further reports on secondary skull fractures in shots from captive <b>bolt</b> <b>guns.</b> Up to now, the pertinent literature places particular emphasis on the absence of indirect lesions away from the impact point, when dealing with the wounding capacity of slaughterer's guns. The recent observation of two suicidal head injuries accompanied by skull fractures {{far away from the}} bolt's path gave occasion to experimental studies using simulants (glycerin soap, balls from gelatin) and skull brain models. As far as ballistic soap was concerned, the dimensions of the bolt's channel were assessed by multi-slice computed tomography before cutting the blocks open. The test shots to gelatin balls and to skull-brain models were documented by means of a high-speed motion camera. As expected, the typical temporary cavity effect of bullets fired from conventional guns could not be observed when captive bolt stunners were discharged. Nevertheless, the visualized transfer of kinetic energy justifies the assumption that the secondary fractures seen in thin parts of the skull were caused by a hydraulic burst effect...|$|R
