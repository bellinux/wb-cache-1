The industrial use of biotechnology is bringing about new products and processes aimed at the use of renewable resources, as well as the application of green technologies with low energy consumption and environmentally acceptable processes. Textile processing is a growing industry that has traditionally used a lot of water, energy and harsh chemicals. Due to the ever growing costs of water and energy worldwide, the investigations are carried out to substitute conventional chemical textile processes by environmentally friendly and economically attractive bioprocesses using enzymes. The application of cellulases for denim finishing and laccases for decolourization of textile effluents, and textile bleaching are most recent commercial advances. New developments rely on the modification of natural and synthetic fibres. This work represents a review of enzyme applications in textile processes. The described <b>bio-processings</b> were accompanied by a significantly lower consumption of energy, water, chemicals, time and costs.

30|$|At most, {{employing}} P. aeruginosa strains {{in industrialized}} <b>bio-processing</b> is a fuzzy issue raising several {{questions regarding the}} likelihood of health risks imposed by such strains {{even though they are}} of environmental origin not clinical. This in turn addressed the cardinal need to seek for the location of genes encoding the present unusual siderophore trait in the genome of P. aeruginosa strain EGYII DSM 101801. Present finding reveals that the whole genes responsible for siderophoregenesis of this non-fluorescent unusual siderophore by this strain is carried out on a plasmid mediated iron uptake system namely pSID/EGYII as deduced from the perceivable zones of inhibition of E. amylovora strain EGY 1 DSM 101800 growth mediated by cell lysate of E. coli JM 109 (DE 3) transformants harboring pSID/EGYII. So far, no available reports have handled this issue extensively. Hence, the need to carry out a mini library to catch up the whole genes harbored by the naturally existing pSID/EGYII is highly addressed to gain more insights about the nature of these genes prior to employing the recombinant strain E. coli JM 109 (DE 3)pSID/EGY II in commercialized <b>bio-processing</b> for an intended absolute exploitation of this unusual siderophore in the future. Present finding is in agreement with those of Tolmasky et al. and Osorio et al. who stated that the genes encoding for the anguibactin and piscibactin iron uptake systems in V. anguillarum and Photobacterium damselae subsp. Piscicida are harbored by pJM 1 and pPHDP 70 plasmids, respectively (Tolmasky et al. 1988; Osorio et al. 2015).|$|E
30|$|Normally, {{monitoring}} the expression {{profile of a}} gene encoding of an industrially important product of microbial origin is a subject of a prime importance in the agenda of commercialized <b>bio-processing.</b> This addressed the indispensable need to trace the expression of SID EGYII activity throughout the growth course of P. aeruginosa strain EGYII DSM 101801 in PYB broth (siderophore production medium). Late expression of genes encoding SID EGY II activity was noted nearly {{at the end of}} exponential phase; whilst, maximum SID EGYII activity was achieved during the stationary phase. Generally, the onset of expression for a gene encoding a certain trait among bacterial candidates in <b>bio-processing</b> varies widely among different bacterial members belonging to different genera and species and even among different strains belonging to the same species and subspecies. Present finding is partially in accordance with others who reported that perceivable levels of siderophores were successfully traced after 5  h of incubation of P. fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, P. putida and P. mosselii, separately in casamino acid (CCA) medium and succinate medium (SM) followed by an elevation in the level of the produced siderophores from 24 to 48  h (Ines et al. 2012). In addition, siderophore production from P. fluorescens was reported to be initiated after 6  h of bacterial growth achieving maximum production after 24  h (Tailor and Joshi 2012). However, siderophore production from P. aeruginosa BUP 2 occurred during the late senescence phase (96  h) of the bacterial growth in BUP medium (Unni et al. 2014). Wensing et al.

The obstacles in extraction of nickel from lateritic minerals are attributed to their very complex mineralogy and low nickel content.
