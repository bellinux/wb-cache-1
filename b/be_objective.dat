25|$|To begin with, Kant's {{distinction}} between the a posteriori being contingent and particular knowledge, and the a priori being universal and necessary knowledge, must be kept in mind. For if we merely connect two intuitions together in a perceiving subject, the knowledge is always subjective because it is derived a posteriori, when what is desired is for the knowledge to <b>be</b> <b>objective,</b> that is, for the two intuitions {{to refer to the}} object and hold good of it necessarily universally for anyone at any time, not just the perceiving subject in its current condition. What else is equivalent to objective knowledge besides the a priori, that is to say, universal and necessary knowledge? Nothing else, and hence before knowledge can <b>be</b> <b>objective,</b> it must be incorporated under an a priori category of the understanding.|$|E
25|$|In {{acoustics}} or psychophysiology, {{the distinction}} may <b>be</b> <b>objective.</b> In modern times, {{it usually is}} based on the perception of harmonic partials of the sounds considered, {{to such an extent that}} the distinction really holds only in the case of harmonic sounds (i.e. sounds with harmonic partials).|$|E
25|$|Bug {{management}} {{includes the}} process of documenting, categorizing, assigning, reproducing, correcting and releasing the corrected code. Proposed changes to software– bugs as well as enhancement requests and even entire releases– are commonly tracked and managed using bug tracking systems or issue tracking systems. The items added may be called defects, tickets, issues, or, following the agile development paradigm, stories and epics. Categories may <b>be</b> <b>objective,</b> subjective or a combination, such as version number, area of the software, severity and priority, {{as well as what}} type of issue it is, such as a feature request or a bug.|$|E

25|$|Although Kant {{considered}} {{these two}} interests of reason to <b>be</b> <b>objective</b> and universal, {{the distinction between}} the natural and human sciences was institutionalized in Germany, through the organization of scholarly research and teaching, following the Enlightenment. In Germany the Enlightenment was dominated by Kant himself, who sought to establish principles based on universal rationality. In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as Johann Gottfried Herder (an influence to Boas) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. In 1795, the great linguist and philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. Humboldt founded the University of Berlin in 1809, and his work in geography, history, and psychology provided the milieu in which Boas's intellectual orientation matured.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{underwriting}} is {{a health}} insurance term {{referring to the}} use of medical or health information in the evaluation of an applicant for coverage, typically for life or health insurance. As part of the underwriting process, an individual's health information may be used in making two decisions: whether to offer or deny coverage and what premium rate to set for the policy. The two most common methods of medical underwriting are known as moratorium underwriting, a relatively simple process, and full medical underwriting, a more indepth analysis of a client's health information. The use of medical underwriting may be restricted by law in certain insurance markets. If allowed, the criteria used should <b>be</b> <b>objective,</b> clearly related to the likely cost of providing coverage, practical to administer, consistent with applicable law, and designed to protect the long-term viability of the insurance system.|$|E

500|$|Peter Ucko, {{who was one}} of Childe's successors as {{director}} of the Institute of Archaeology, highlighted that in his writings, Childe accepted the subjectivity of archaeological interpretation, something which was {{in stark contrast to the}} processualists' insistence that archaeological interpretation could <b>be</b> <b>objective.</b> This acceptance of subjectivity led Trigger to comment that Childe was a [...] "prototypical post-processual archaeologist".|$|E
500|$|It is {{not easy}} to <b>be</b> <b>objective</b> about the nature of Thomas Brassey's {{character}} because the earliest biography by Helps was commissioned by the Brassey family and the latest, rather short, biography was written by his great-great-grandson, Tom Stacey. There is virtually no remaining material of value to a biographer available today. [...] There is no private correspondence, there are no diaries and none of his personal reminiscences.|$|E
500|$|Friedman's essay [...] "The Methodology of Positive Economics" [...] (1953) {{provided}} the epistemological pattern {{for his own}} subsequent research and {{to a degree that}} of the Chicago School. There he argued that economics as science should be free of value judgments for it to <b>be</b> <b>objective.</b> Moreover, a useful economic theory should be judged not by its descriptive realism but by its simplicity and fruitfulness as an engine of prediction. That is, students should measure the accuracy of its predictions, rather than the 'soundness of its assumptions'. His argument was part of an ongoing debate among such statisticians as Jerzy Neyman, Leonard Savage, and Ronald Fisher.|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Lieberson, {{writing for}} The New York Review of Books, {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "attractively written, never shrill or unduly proselytizing, careful to avoid the hysteria and tribalism that usually characterize {{the early years of}} movements like est", but considered Bartley to have [...] "fallen" [...] for Erhard. Given Bartley's previous work, Lieberson stated, he might have made an ideal interpreter of Erhard, but he found this expectation [...] "disappointed [...] the book is nevertheless instructive". A review of Werner Erhard in Kirkus Reviews similarly concluded, [...] "Too entranced to be truly objective, Bartley is nonetheless an insightfully partial observer." [...] Booklist stated that Bartley, as an est student, had made the [...] "mistake of being too close to his subject to <b>be</b> <b>objective</b> or critical." ...|$|E
500|$|Steinitz {{strove to}} <b>be</b> <b>objective</b> in his {{writings}} about chess competitions and games, for example he attributed to sheer bad luck a poor tournament score by Henry Edward Bird, whom he considered no friend of his, and was generous in his praise of great play by even his bitter enemies. He could poke fun at {{some of his own}} rhetoric, for example [...] "I remarked that I would rather die in America than live in England. ... I added that I would rather lose a match in America than win one in England. But after having carefully considered the subject in all its bearings, I {{have come to the conclusion}} that I neither mean to die yet nor to lose the match." [...] At a joint simultaneous display in Russia around the time of the 1895–96 Saint Petersburg tournament, Emanuel Lasker and Steinitz formed an impromptu comedy double act.|$|E
500|$|Glosserman and {{the rest}} of the {{production}} team met together to put together a focus for the film; they centered their efforts on answering the question: [...] "How does Wikipedia get at the truth?" [...] They also wanted to provide information for everyday individuals wanting to know about Wikipedia's background and functioning. Experts were sought out, including the author of The Age of American Unreason Susan Jacoby, to discuss Wikipedia's approach to scholars knowledgeable about specific subject matter. Glosserman commented in an interview with IndieWire, [...] "We tried to get people offering compelling arguments for either side of any particular topic because our intention was to <b>be</b> <b>objective</b> and to let the viewer make up his or her own mind." [...] The narrative structure of the film What the Bleep Do We Know!? served as an inspiration for Glosserman during the production process. As a non-profit project, the film had received more than $55,000 in donations by March 2009.|$|E

This phenomenon needs more analysis and description.|$|R
