2500|$|Several major {{transitions}} in shell pattern and morphology {{can be observed}} during the life of Haliotis asinina. The species has a pelagobenthic life cycle that includes a minimal period of three to four days in the plankton. <b>Biomineralisation</b> begins shortly after hatching, with the fabrication of the larval shell (protoconch) over about a 10-hour period. The initial differentiation of biomineralising cells is likely to include a localised thickening of the dorsal ectoderm followed by an invagination of cells to form the shell gland. The shell gland then evaginates to form the shell field which expands through mitotic divisions to direct the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) via the secretion of organic molecules. In this way the larval shell (protoconch) is formed. The construction of the haliotid protoconch is complete following torsion.

2500|$|Otolith and {{vertebrae}} {{studies have}} proved useful {{in determining the}} age and thus growth patterns of the species, with other methods including scale and fin ray sectioning having lesser value. The species otoliths {{have been the subject}} of detailed X-ray diffraction studies, which have indicated <b>biomineralisation</b> of the otoliths occurs predominantly in the aragonite phase. Females grow faster than males, reaching 266.5mm after their first year of life, 364.4 after their second, 370.9mm after the third and 546.7 after their fifth. A female of 676.6mm was 9 years old. Males reach 252.4mm in their first year, 336.2mm in their second, 363.8 in the third and 510.3 in their fifth. A male of 554mm was eight years old. The oldest studied individual was a 934-mm individual of unspecified sex, which was 17 years old. The larvae are pelagic and are found over continental shelf waters and occasionally in the oceanic zone proximal to the continental slope. They are present all year round in the Gulf of Mexico, with a peak in abundance during the summer months due to spawning peaks. While the young juveniles live in the exposed pelagic environment, they use a behaviour called 'piloting' to [...] swim in very close proximity to both larger animals and floating objects, such as sargassum mats, buoys and even boats. By the time juveniles make their way to shore, they may have been dispersed large distances from their initial spawning grounds and may face the challenge of migration to warmer climates during winter if they are to survive as outlined previously. Juveniles use estuaries and seagrass beds as their main nursery habitats.|$|E

5000|$|While it is {{difficult}} to infer the effect of changing planetary conditions on organisms, communities and ecosystems, great changes were happening {{at the end of the}} Precambrian and the start of the Early Cambrian. The breakup of the supercontinents, rising sea levels (creating shallow, [...] "life-friendly" [...] seas), a nutrient crisis, fluctuations in atmospheric composition, including oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, and changes in ocean chemistry(promoting <b>biomineralisation)</b> could all have played a part.|$|E
50|$|Most {{traditional}} {{approaches to}} synthesis of nanoscale materials are energy inefficient, requiring stringent conditions (e.g., high temperature, pressure or pH) and often produce toxic byproducts. Furthermore, the quantities produced are small, {{and the resultant}} material is usually irreproducible because of the difficulties in controlling agglomeration. In contrast, materials produced by organisms have properties that usually surpass those of analogous synthetically manufactured materials with similar phase composition. Biological materials are assembled in aqueous environments under mild conditions by using macromolecules. Organic macromolecules collect and transport raw materials and assemble these substrates and into short- and long-range ordered composites with consistency and uniformity.The aim of biomimetics is to mimic the natural way of producing minerals such as apatites. Many man-made crystals require elevated temperatures and strong chemical solutions, whereas the organisms have long been able to lay down elaborate mineral structures at ambient temperatures. Often, the mineral phases are not pure but are made as composites that entail an organic part, often protein, which takes part in and controls the <b>biomineralisation.</b> These composites are often not only as hard as the pure mineral but also tougher, as the micro-environment controls <b>biomineralisation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Being soft-bodied organisms, {{the fossil}} record of polychaetes is {{dominated}} by their fossilized jaws, known as scolecodonts, and the mineralized tubes {{that some of them}} secrete.

Polychaete cuticle does have some preservation potential; it tends to survive for at least 30 days after a polychaete's death. Although <b>biomineralisation</b> is usually necessary to preserve soft tissue after this time, the presence of polychaete muscle in the nonmineralised Burgess shale shows this need not always be the case.

50|$|Exciting new {{developments}} in biotechnology are now revolutionizing biology and biomedical research. Examples of these techniques are high-throughput sequencing, high-throughput quantitative PCR, intra-cellular imaging, in-situ hybridization of gene expression, three-dimensional imaging techniques like Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy and Optical Projection, (micro)-Computer Tomography. Given the massive amounts of complicated data that is generated by these techniques, their meaningful interpretation, and even their storage, form major challenges calling for new approaches. Going beyond current bioinformatics approaches, computational biology needs to develop new methods to discover meaningful patterns in these large data sets. Model-based reconstruction of gene networks {{can be used to}} organize the gene expression data in systematic way and to guide future data collection. A major challenge here is to understand how gene regulation is controlling fundamental biological processes like <b>biomineralisation</b> and embryogenesis. The sub-processes like gene regulation, organic molecules interacting with the mineral deposition process, cellular processes, physiology and other processes at the tissue and environmental levels are linked. Rather than being directed by a central control mechanism, <b>biomineralisation</b> and embryogenesis can be viewed as an emergent behavior resulting from a complex system in which several sub-processes on very different temporal and spatial scales (ranging from nanometer and nanoseconds to meters and years) are connected into a multi-scale system. One of the few available options to understand such systems is by developing a multi-scale model of the system.|$|E
50|$|Discinidae is {{a family}} in the brachiopod {{superfamily}} Discinoidea. Unlike most brachiopods, which have uniformly calcitic or phosphatic shells, modern-day discinids incorporate tablets of silica into their valves. These are covered with vesicles into which the siliceous tablets are cemented, much like a closely packed mosaic, and held together with apatite. These vesicles eventually degrade, but nevertheless still leave an imprint on the shell itself. It {{has been suggested that}} this siliceous <b>biomineralisation</b> might also have occurred amongst some of the earliest Paleozoic brachiopods because similar patterns of shell imprints have been observed amongst them too.|$|E
50|$|From a {{thermodynamic}} {{point of}} view, {{in the presence}} of a neutral pH and a low redox potential, the inorganic synthesis of magnetite is favoured when compared to those of other iron oxides. It would thus appear microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions create a suitable potential for the formation of BMPs. Moreover, all iron absorbed by the bacteria is rapidly converted into magnetite, indicating the formation of crystals is not preceded by the accumulation of intermediate iron compounds; this also suggests the structures and the enzymes necessary for <b>biomineralisation</b> are already present within the bacteria. These conclusions are also supported by the fact that MTB cultured in aerobic conditions (and thus nonmagnetic) contain amounts of iron comparable to any other species of bacteria.|$|E
50|$|The {{inclination}} of the Earth's {{magnetic field}} in the two respective hemispheres selects {{one of the two}} possible polarities of the magnetotactic cells (with respect to the flagellated pole of the cell), orienting the <b>biomineralisation</b> of the magnetosomes. Various experiments have clearly shown that magnetotaxis and aerotaxis work in conjunction in the magnetotactic bacteria. Aerotaxis is the response by which bacteria migrate to an optimal oxygen concentration in an oxygen gradient. It has been shown that, in water droplets, one-way swimming magnetotactic bacteria can reverse their swimming direction and swim backwards under reducing conditions (less than optimal oxygen concentration), as opposed to oxic conditions (greater than optimal oxygen concentration). The behaviour that has been observed in these bacterial strains has been referred to as magneto-aerotaxis.|$|E
50|$|Matrix vesicles {{are located}} within the {{extracellular}} space, or matrix. Using electron microscopy they were discovered independently in 1967 by H. Clarke Anderson and Ermanno Bonucci. These cell-derived vesicles are specialized to initiate <b>biomineralisation</b> of the matrix {{in a variety of}} tissues, including bone, cartilage and dentin. During normal calcification, a major influx of calcium and phosphate ions into the cells accompanies cellular apoptosis (genetically determined self-destruction) and matrix vesicle formation. Calcium-loading also leads to formation of phosphatidylserine:calcium:phosphate complexes in the plasma membrane mediated in part by a protein called annexins. Matrix vesicles bud from the plasma membrane at sites of interaction with the extracellular matrix. Thus, matrix vesicles convey to the extracellular matrix calcium, phosphate, lipids and the annexins which act to nucleate mineral formation. These processes are precisely coordinated to bring about, at the proper place and time, mineralization of the tissue's matrix unless the Golgi are non-existent.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>biomineralisation</b> of the {{magnetite}} requires regulating {{mechanisms to}} control the concentration of iron, the crystal nucleation, the redox potential and the pH. This is achieved by means of compartmentalisation in structures known as magnetosomes that allow the biochemical control of the above-mentioned processes. After the genome of several MTB species had been sequenced, a comparative analysis of the proteins involved {{in the formation of}} the BMP became possible. Sequence homology with proteins belonging to the ubiquitous cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family and the [...] "Htr-like" [...] serine proteases has been found: While the first group is exclusively dedicated to the transport of heavy metals, the second group consists of heat shock proteins (HSPs) involved in the degradation of badly folded proteins. Other than the serine protease domain, some proteins found in the magnetosomial membrane (MM) also contain PDZ domains, while several other MM proteins contain tetratrico peptide repeat (TPR) domains.|$|E
50|$|Generally chitons have {{separate}} sexes and sperm and eggs are spawned through a simple gonad near the posterior {{end of the}} foot (Eernisse, 2007). Chitons {{do not have a}} free swimming larval stage so distribution of the organism is not particularly great (Powell, 1961). Once the egg has been released through the anus it moves through currents into plankton where it hatches after about 2 days. Next metamorphosis occurs to promote larval settlement. The changes are not dramatic but it does start the <b>biomineralisation</b> of the valves and radula present in the adult stage. After this the prototroch and apical tuft are cast off and the shape of the organism changes from elongated to oval in outline about 0.5mm in length with only seven calcareous valves. A month later the eighth valve becomes apparent and two red larval spots present themselves which are lost when the organism reaches maturity.

40|$|Cultured pearl {{production}} {{is a complex}} biological process involving the implantation of a mantle graft from a donor pearl oyster along with a bead nucleus into the gonad of a second recipient host oyster. Therefore, pearl production potentially involves the genetic co-operation of two oyster genomes. Whilst many genes in the mantle tissue have been identified and linked to shell <b>biomineralisation</b> in pearl oysters, few studies have determined which of these <b>biomineralisation</b> genes are expressed in the pearl sac and potentially linked to pearl <b>biomineralisation</b> processes. It is also uncertain whether the host or donor oyster is primarily responsible {{for the expression of}} <b>biomineralisation</b> genes governing pearl formation, with only two shell matrix proteins previously identified as being expressed by the donor oyster in the pearl sac. To further our understanding of pearl formation, the pearl sac transcriptome of Pinctada maxima and Pinctada margaritifera was each sequenced to an equivalent 5 Ã— genome coverage with putative molluscan biomineralisation-related genes identified. Furthermore, the host and donor contribution of these expressed genes within the pearl sac were quantified using a novel approach whereby two pearl oyster species harbouring unique genomes, P. maxima or P. margaritifera, were used to produce xenografted pearl sacs. A total of 19 putative mollusc <b>biomineralisation</b> genes were identified and found to be expressed in the pearl sacs of P. maxima and P. margaritifera. From this list of expressed genes, species-diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were identified within seven of these genes; Linkine, N 66, Perline, N 44, MSI 60, Calreticulin and PfCHS 1. Based on the presence/absence of species diagnostic gene transcripts within xenografted pearl sacs, all seven genes were found to be expressed by the species used as the donor oyster.
