40|$|On {{a recent}} day, I used my credit cards in {{connection}} with a number of minor transactions. I made eight purchases, and I paid two credit card bills. I also discarded (without opening) three solicitations for new cards, balance transfer programs, or other similar offers to extend credit via a credit card. Statistics suggest that I am not atypical. U. S. consumers last year used credit cards in about 100 purchasing transactions per capita, with an average value of about $ 70. At the end of the year, Americans owed nearly $ 500 billion dollars, in the range of $ 1, 800 for every man, woman, and child in the population. Although the individual credit card transaction is small and routine, the transactions collectively {{have a significant effect on}} the overall stability of many American families, leading to a rise in consumer borrowing and an increase in bankruptcy filing rates. The crux of the borrowing problem is the relationship between the cardholder and the issuer, which the law relegates almost entirely to the private contractual relationships between those groups. Yet the existing literature has done little to assess the unique contracting problems that those transactions present. That is not to say that scholars. have overlooked credit cards. On the contrary, some scholars have noticed the lengthy fine-print agreements that issuers tender to their cardholders. Thus, credit cards have become a common topic in the boilerplate literature that culminates in the symposium for which this Article is prepared. The branch of that literature focused on consumer contracts explores the extent to which voluminous terms in adhesion contracts become enforceable without the type of voluntary and informed assent on which the paradigm of contract law rests. At the same time, other scholars have become increasingly concerned about the likelihood that cognitive and behavioral limitations restrict the ability of consumers to evaluate <b>borrowing</b> <b>transactions</b> effectively...|$|R

The League adopted an innovative system of funds management and monitoring that ensured compliance of borrowing countries with its programs. We provide empirical evidence that financial markets viewed the League’s role as an external, multilateral agent positively, solving the credibility problem of borrowing countries allowing them to engage in economic and institutional reforms. This success was achieved despite the League’s own lack of lending resources. We also demonstrate that this multilateral solution performed better than the bilateral arrangements adopted by other governments in Eastern Europe because of its lower <b>borrowing</b> and <b>transaction</b> costs...|$|R

In addition, the failure of insuring persistent or permanent shocks alone yields empirically reasonable predictions. Third, recent theoretical research has made attempts to endogenize incomplete insurance from first principles.

Finally the theoretical research into incomplete markets triggers a reassessment of welfare implications as to business cycles, economic growth, and financial integration. ...|$|R

Preceded by {{the many}} suicides in the LGBT youth community, along with {{alarming}} trends in assault and bullying of this population, The FAIR Education Act was passed into law in 2012. The purpose of this law was to mandate the inclusion of LGBT history into the K- 12 curriculum of our public schools {{with the intent of}} creating safer school climates. This study considers the implementation of California???s curriculum inclusion law in a sampling of California high schools. With a focus on teachers as implementers the goal was to discover if teachers were implementing and if so, explore supports and barriers for teachers as well as a path forward towards fuller implementation. Using a mixed methods sequential approach, an initial survey was sent to gather data from social studies and history teachers in a sampling of high schools, to which 83 districts across Northern California responded. In-depth interviews further explored the process of implementation as it was found. Using the implementation model of James A. Banks (1990) implementation levels were assessed in both the survey and the interviews. Ernest House???s (1998) framework, <b>borrowing</b> from <b>Transaction</b> Cost Economics, was used as a means for measuring likely success of SB 48 and for looking at barriers to implementation from the teacher???s perspective. Finally, the lens of Sociotransformative Constructivism, a nascent theory blending Multicultural Education and Crtitical Pedagogy, was used as a social justice lens to create a path forward towards fuller inclusion and safer schools for LGBT youth. 	Results from this study add to the knowledge of not only why educational reforms often fail to create the intended change, but how we can create the necessary supports for teachers who are currently self-supporting their own implementation.

40|$|This article {{examines}} differences in credit-card and debit-card usage between the United States and Japan. Although I do not doubt that {{social and psychological}} factors have some significance, I contend that four institutional factors also have useful explanatory power: the freedom of banks to enter the industry; the size of retailers; the level of telecommunications costs; {{and the size of}} the national economy. Generally, credit cards in Japan are used for a smaller share of transactions, with a higher average amount, and with less <b>borrowing</b> per <b>transaction.</b> The costs to merchants that take the cards and the rates of fraud also are noticeably higher in Japan than in the United States. The article argues that the difference in usage is attributable primarily to regulations that largely excluded banks and their affiliates from credit- card lending until 1992 and also, to some lesser degree, to the relatively small size of Japanese retailers. The article concludes that the differences in discount rates and fraud rates are more likely to be transient, but attributable to a combination of factors, including the comparatively small payment-card market and high telecommunications costs, both of which have hampered the sophistication of responses to fraudulent transactions. Debit cards are used quite rarely in Japan?the first general-use debit card was not introduced until the spring of 2000. Although that card is cheaper for the merchants that take it than credit cards, and also is much more resistant to fraudulent transactions, the article suggests that the debit card will not find as large a market in Japan as it has in the United States. The reason is that the shift of the credit card from its use as a borrowing device in the United States to its use as a near-cash payment device in Japan leaves a much smaller niche for the debit card in Japan. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the debt {{capacity of a}} risky asset when debt is being rolled over {{and there is a}} liquidation cost in case of default. We show that debt capacity depends on how information {{about the quality of the}} asset is revealed. When the information structure is based on “optimistic” expectations, the arrival of no news about the asset is good news; under this structure, debt capacity does not depend upon rollovers and liquidation cost, and is simply equal to expected cash flows from the asset. In contrast, when the information structure is based on “pessimistic” expectations, no news about the asset is bad news; under this structure, debt capacity of the asset is decreasing in the liquidation cost and frequency of rollovers. In the limit, as the number of rollovers becomes unbounded, the debt capacity goes to zero even for an arbitrarily small default risk. Our model explains why markets for rollover debt, such as asset-backed commercial paper, may experience sudden freezes.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} financial liberalisation on the capital structure of non-financial firms listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). The research hypotheses have been formulated and tested by using various econometric estimation procedures. The empirical assessment begins by resolving some methodological issues relating to the dating of financial liberalisation and the measurement of leverage. Next, a panel of 100 non-financial firms is constructed for the period 1989 to 2007. The pooled Ordinary Least Squares, fixed (within), and random effects (Generalised Least Squares) models are used to estimate the impact of various aspects of financial liberalisation on firm capital structure. Robustness checks are performed by using the instrumental variable technique and the Arellano and Bond (1991 : 277) two-step Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) procedure. Irrespective of the procedure used, the lifting of international sanctions and stock market liberalisation {{is associated with a}} reduction in leverage for all sets of firms. Capital account liberalisation causes firms to access more debt, and there is mild support for domestic financial sector liberalisation. Stock market liberalisation provides avenues for firms to increase their debt maturity structure. The size of the stock market is positively associated with leverage, and banking sector development is negatively correlated to leverage. The effect of financial liberalisation is more pronounced for larger firms, suggesting that the process of financial liberalisation causes a wedge between small and large firms. Furthermore, regime dummies are interacted with firm specific determinants of capital structure. The notable facts arising out of the interactive dummy variable exercise reveal that the lifting of international sanctions and stock market liberalisation cause significant structural shifts in the profitability, growth and tax rate variables. This is evident for the book and market value of the debt to equity ratio. The results of the dynamic model of capital structure document evidence of transaction costs for both the pre and post liberalisation regime. However, it appears that transaction costs reduce dramatically in the post liberalisation regime. The associated coefficient of adjustment increases accordingly. This suggests that a developed financial system promotes competition amongst the issuers of capital, thereby lowering <b>borrowing</b> and <b>transaction</b> costs. The empirical significance of firm specific determinants in a closed economy appears to be weaker than that of the post liberalised regime. Furthermore, firm size speeds up the adjustment to the target level of leverage for firms operating in both the pre and post liberalisation regimes. Finally, the results confirm most of the theoretical predictions of capital structure theories. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012. Financial Managementunrestricte...|$|R
