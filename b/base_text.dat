5|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{important}} of the Ten Wings is the Great Commentary (Dazhuan) or Xi ci, which dates to roughly 300 BC. The Great Commentary describes the I Ching as a microcosm of the universe and a symbolic description of the processes of change. By partaking in the spiritual experience of the I Ching, the Great Commentary states, the individual can understand the deeper patterns of the universe. Among other subjects, it explains how the eight trigrams proceeded from the eternal oneness of the universe through three bifurcations. The other Wings provide different perspectives on essentially the same viewpoint, giving ancient, cosmic authority to the I Ching. For example, the Wenyan provides a moral interpretation that parallels the first two hexagrams, 乾 (qián) and 坤 (kūn), with Heaven and Earth, and the Shuogua attributes to the symbolic function of the hexagrams the ability to understand self, world, and destiny. Throughout the Ten Wings, there are passages that seem to purposefully increase the ambiguity of the <b>base</b> <b>text,</b> pointing to a recognition of multiple layers of symbolism.|$|E
5|$|The Ebionite gospel is {{one example}} of a type of gospel harmony that used the Gospel of Matthew as a <b>base</b> <b>text</b> but did not include the Gospel of John; it is {{believed}} to pre-date Tatian's Diatessaron (c.170) which included all four canonical gospels. The gospel has a parallel to a quotation in a mid-2nd-century homily known as 2 Clement, suggesting that both may be dependent on a harmonizing tradition from an earlier 2nd century source. The harmonized gospel sayings sources used by Justin Martyr to compose his First Apology and Dialogue with Trypho were similarly based on the Synoptic Gospels. According to scholar George Howard, harmonization was a widely used method of composition in the early Patristic period. Many of the heterodox variants found in the Gospel of the Ebionites may have been adopted from a larger pool of variants that were in circulation; an example is the appearance of a great light that shone during Jesus' Baptism which is also found in the Diatessaron.|$|E

Abstract — A novel {{method by}} {{combining}} the edge-based and stroke filter <b>based</b> <b>text</b> extraction in the videos is presented. Several researchers have used edge-based and filter <b>based</b> <b>text</b> extraction in the video frames. However, these individual techniques are having their own advantages and disadvantages to extract text in the video frames. Combination of these two techniques fetches good result as compared to individual techniques. In this paper, the canny edge-based and stroke filter for text extraction in the video frames are amalgamated.

2500|$|Furigana {{unrelated}} to the kanji they're assigned to are quite often used to convey certain effects, rather than to denote a phonetic guide, especially in manga, anime and games. For example, the word [...] "nightmare" [...] may be assigned with [...] shinjitsu [...] "truth" [...] rather than its true reading, [...] akumu, to convey the meaning of [...] "nightmarish truth". Some authors may even use furigana that means {{the opposite of what}} the <b>base</b> <b>text</b> does to reinforce an effect, such as the complicated relationship between characters. For example, [...] shin'yū [...] "close friend" [...] may be tagged with [...] raibaru [...] "rival", to mean [...] "you're my rival, but also my friend"; or conversely, [...] kōtekishu [...] "eternal rival" [...] may be tagged with [...] tomo [...] "friend".|$|E
2500|$|The Authorized Version is notably more Latinate than {{previous}} English versions, especially the Geneva Bible. This results {{in part from}} the academic stylistic preferences of a number of the translators – several of whom admitted to being more comfortable writing in Latin than in English – but was also, in part, a consequence of the royal proscription against explanatory notes. Hence, where the Geneva Bible might use a common English word – and gloss its particular application in a marginal note – the Authorized Version tends rather to prefer a technical term, frequently in Anglicized Latin. Consequently, although the King had instructed the translators to use the Bishops' Bible as a <b>base</b> <b>text,</b> the New Testament in particular owes much stylistically to the Catholic Rheims New Testament, whose translators had also been concerned to find English equivalents for Latin terminology. In addition, the translators of the New Testament books habitually quote Old Testament names in the renderings familiar from the Vulgate Latin rather than in forms closer to the original Hebrew (e.g. [...] "Elias" [...] and [...] "Jeremias" [...] for [...] "Elijah" [...] and [...] "Jeremiah", respectively).|$|E

2500|$|The early printings of the Latin Bible took {{examples}} of the Paris Bible as their <b>base</b> <b>text,</b> culminating in the successive critical Vulgate editions of Robert Estienne (Stephanus). Estienne's Geneva Vulgate of 1555, the first Bible to be subdivided throughout into chapters and verses, remained the standard Latin Bible for Reformed Protestantism; and established {{the content of the}} Vulgate as 76 books: 27 New Testament, 39 Hebrew Bible, plus Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, 1 and 2 Maccabees, 3 Esdras, 4 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasses. At the Council of Trent it was agreed that seven of these books (all except 3 Esdras, 4 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasses) should be considered inspired scripture; and the term [...] "deuterocanonical", first applied by Sixtus of Siena, was adopted to categorise them. The Council also requested that the Pope should undertake the production of definitive editions of the Latin, Greek and Hebrew scriptures conforming to their definition of the biblical canon; and this resulted, after several false starts, in the publication of the Clementine Vulgate of 1592. This incorporates the books of Trent's Deuterocanon in the main Bible text; but also introduces, following the New Testament, a section of Apocrypha, containing the Prayer of Manasses, 3 Esdras and 4 Esdras, of which only the first two are found in the Septuagint.|$|E
2500|$|A {{committee}} {{was formed by}} Pope Pius IV in 1561 to undertake the task, but it worked slowly and ineffectively. A second {{committee was}} appointed by Pope Pius V in 1569. Pope Sixtus V appointed a third committee, who took as their <b>base</b> <b>text</b> the Louvain Vulgate edition of 1583 (based on the edition of Hentenius), recording variant readings from authoritative manuscripts in the margin. A recommended text was presented in 1589. Sixtus was dissatisfied with the result, judging {{that it was too}} far from the familiar printed editions. He had substantial changes made to the text, using the Vulgate edition of Robertus Stephanus corrected to agree with the Greek; and introducing personal changes, including an entirely new system of verse divisions. This revised version was hurried into print; and suffered from misprints in the Old Testament. In addition, three whole verses were found to have been dropped from the Book of Numbers; Numbers 30:11-13, though it is unclear whether this was an error in printing or a 'wild' editorial choice. [...] The Bible appeared in 1590 and is known as Sistine Vulgate. Sixtus immediately issued corrigenda as pasted slips to be inserted into copies. After the Pope's sudden death, Robert Bellarmine warned that the work was an embarrassment, and a great danger to the church. The College of Cardinals stopped all further sales, and bought and destroyed as many copies as possible.|$|E
2500|$|The Latin biblical {{texts in}} use before Jerome's Vulgate are usually {{referred}} to collectively as the , or [...] "Old Latin Bible"; where [...] "Old Latin" [...] {{means that they}} are older than the Vulgate and written in Latin, not that they are written in Old Latin. Jerome himself uses the term [...] "Latin Vulgate" [...] for the Vetus Latina text, so intending to denote this version as the common Latin rendering of the Greek Vulgate or Common Septuagint; and this remained the usual {{use of the term}} 'Latin Vulgate" [...] in the West for centuries. Jerome reserves the term 'Septuagint' to refer to the Hexaplar Septuagint. The earliest known use of the term Vulgata to describe the 'new' Latin translation was made by Roger Bacon in the 13th century. The translations in the Vetus Latina had accumulated piecemeal over a century or more; they were not translated by a single person or institution, nor uniformly edited. The individual books varied in quality of translation and style, and different manuscripts witness wide variations in readings; some books appear to have been translated several times. Jerome, in his preface to the Vulgate gospels, commented that there were [...] "as many [...] as there are manuscripts". The <b>base</b> <b>text</b> for Jerome's revision of the gospels was an Old Latin text similar to the Codex Veronensis; with the text of the Gospel of John conforming more to that in the Codex Corbiensis.|$|E
