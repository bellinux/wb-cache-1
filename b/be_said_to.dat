5|$|Long hair is a hairstyle {{where the}} head hair {{is allowed to}} grow to {{considerable}} length. Exactly what constitutes long hair can change from culture to culture, or even within cultures. For example, a woman with chin-length hair in some cultures may <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have short hair, while a man with the same length of hair {{in some of the}} same cultures would <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have long hair.|$|E
5|$|Though {{often used}} interchangeably, in biology these words have {{different}} meanings. Fish {{is used as}} a singular noun, or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from a single species. Fishes is used to describe different species or species groups. Thus a pond that contained a single species might <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> contain 120 fish. But if the pond contained a total of 120 fish from three different species, it would <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> contain three fishes. The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{macroeconomics}} can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> {{have begun}} with Keynes and {{the publication of}} his book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in 1936. Keynes expanded on the concept of liquidity preferences and built a general theory of how the economy worked. Keynes's theory was brought together both monetary and real economic factors for the first time, explained unemployment, and suggested policy achieving economic stability.|$|E

5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of cognitivism. Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several {{perceived}} problems.

5|$|The Court also {{rejected}} {{the proposition that}} the principle of proportionality be recognized as a separate ground for judicial review. Rather, it should be subsumed under irrationality, in the sense that if an executive decision is disproportionate it can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be irrational in that no reasonable authority could have come to such a decision.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 940s Constantine {{was an old}} man, perhaps more than 70 years of age. The kingdom of Alba was too new to <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have a {{customary}} rule of succession, but Pictish and Irish precedents favoured an adult successor descended from Kenneth MacAlpin. Constantine's surviving son Indulf, probably baptised in 927, {{would have been too}} young to be a serious candidate for the kingship in the early 940s, and the obvious heir was Constantine's nephew, MalcolmI. As Malcolm was born no later than 901, by the 940s he was no longer a young man, and may have been impatient. Willingly or not—the 11th-century Prophecy of Berchán, a verse history {{in the form of a}} supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision—Constantine abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Malcolm.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, a {{tradition}} had developed that Set had cut Osiris's body into pieces and scattered them across Egypt. Cult centers of Osiris all over the country claimed that the corpse, or particular pieces of it, were found near them. The dismembered parts could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> number as many as forty-two, each piece being equated with one of the forty-two nomes, or provinces, in Egypt. Thus, the god of kingship becomes the embodiment of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E

Most Golondrina specimens from the South Texas Plains are not excavated but rather found on the site's surface. They often appear as part of mixed collections with artifacts of later periods. Several sites have also been found in Arkansas {{as well as in}} the Lower Pecos Canyonlands and the Mexican states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León.|$|E

5|$|Libyan {{involvement}} with Chad can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its guerrilla {{war against the}} Christian President François Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET). Libya's king Idris I felt compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links {{between the two sides}} of the Chadian-Libyan border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies.|$|E
5|$|Reformed Christians believe baptism to {{be a sign}} of regeneration, or {{the making}} of one into a new creature, based on the {{connection}} found in the New Testament between regeneration and washing with water. Baptism also represents forgiveness or remission of sin by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, similarly to the sprinkling of blood of sacrificial animals. Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect regeneration, even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later. However, Reformed theologians do not teach that baptism is necessarily bound to the forgiveness of sins. Not everyone who participates in the outward rite of baptism can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> has had their sins forgiven. Rather, it is necessary that the baptized person participate spiritually by faith in order to receive this benefit.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that Lithuanians began combining their forces {{at the dawn of}} the 13th century. For example, in 1207, soldiers were recruited across Lithuania to fight the German religious orders, and in 1212, Daugirutis' treaty with Novgorod shows that he exerted some degree of influence over a vast area. During the first twenty years of the 13th century, Lithuanians organized some thirty military expeditions to Livonia, Russia, and Poland. Historian Tomas Baranauskas argues that a Lithuanian state could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> exist as early as 1183.|$|E

It is endowed with a multiplication operation, the Lie bracket. With it, the product in the group can near the identity be expressed in Lie algebraic terms (but not in a particularly simple way). The link between the (matrix) Lie algebra and the (matrix) Lie group is the matrix exponential. It is one-to-one near the identity in the group.|$|E
5|$|The Reformed {{tradition}} {{holds that}} baptism is primarily God's promise or offer of grace to the baptized. Baptism {{is said to}} signify union with Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection. The baptized is made one with Christ's person, meaning God the Father treats them the same as he treats Christ. Baptism also unites the baptized with Christ's history, meaning that the person can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have died, been buried, and raised again just as Christ was. The baptized person's identity in Christ is based on Christ's action in baptism rather than the person's action. This union also unites Christians to one another. Through the words of institution used in baptism, Christians are also united {{to each of the}} members of the trinity.|$|E
5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem, and {{understanding of}} the treatment options. In this context, insight can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have three components: recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E
