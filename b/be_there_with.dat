25|$|When Lee {{launched}} the Gettysburg Campaign in June 1863, the Third Corps was initially left along the former Confederate positions along the Rappahannock as a rear guard, following {{the rest of}} the army on the 15th after Lee was convinced that Union commander Joseph Hooker would not launch an attack on Richmond. It arrived at Chambersburg on the 27th and rested for several days; on the evening of June 30th, Hill sent Heth's division to Gettysburg to seize a supply of shoes that was reported to <b>be</b> <b>there,</b> <b>with</b> Pender's division assigned to follow as support. On the morning of July 1st, Heth encountered the leading elements of the Army of the Potomac, thus starting the three-day Battle of Gettysburg. During the morning, Heth's division attacked part of the I Corps and was defeated, with Brigadier General James J. Archer captured (the first general officer in Lee's army to be captured). Both Heth's and Pender's divisions attacked during the afternoon and defeated the I Corps; Heth was wounded during the afternoon attack and was replaced by James J. Pettigrew, while Alfred M. Scales of Pender's division was wounded. On the second day, Hill's corps occupied the center of the Confederate army and was assigned to attack the Union line after Longstreet's corps had launched its attack; however, only three of Anderson's five brigades launched an attack. Ambrose R. Wright was able to briefly pierce the Union center on Cemetery Ridge but was forced to retreat. Before he was able to launch an attack with his division, Pender was mortally wounded by an artillery shell and was replaced by Brigadier General James H. Lane. During the day, Hill was ill and did not supervise the attack by his corps.|$|E
500|$|Actor James Anderson {{was cast}} as Oliver. Before {{assuming}} the role, he shadowed a real F1 doctor on ward rounds – an experience he found difficult. [...] "We were approaching beds {{in which people}} were waking up from heart attacks and coming around quite distressed sometimes. It was really difficult to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> a patient. It's harder than you think and I got quite emotional." [...] Anderson underwent such extensive training with the programme's medical advisors that he jested in June2009, [...] "If I started medical training now, I could probably graduate as a doctor {{coming out of the}} show!" [...] The actor experienced [...] "an extended period of anxiety" [...] upon joining the series, and recalls: [...] "It took me about six months to have any sense {{of what was going on}} and then the second six months to feel comfortable [...] but only because it's such a well-oiled machine. You're coming in as a little cog, so you have to discover how to work in that and that takes a while." ...|$|E
500|$|The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) {{announced}} in September 2009 that it [...] " [...] to prioritise" [...] and {{would most likely}} be sending a weakened squad to tour Bangladesh. The press theorised that possible candidates to be rested included captain Andrew Strauss, Paul Collingwood, Stuart Broad and James Anderson. When the squad was officially {{announced in}} January 2010, only Strauss and Anderson were omitted from the touring squad. The reason given for Anderson's break was to give him opportunity to undergo a specialist review and rehabilitation for a chronic injury to his right knee, to enable {{him to return to}} full fitness for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. The decision to rest Strauss was rationalised by national selector Geoff Miller as [...] "the selectors feel it is important that he takes a break ahead of an extremely busy programme of international cricket". This decision was not universally accepted, with former England captains Ian Botham and Michael Atherton among those who spoke out against the move; Botham claimed: [...] "As captain you need to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> your team ... I think it’s a major mistake." ...|$|E

500|$|Shaunna Murphy of Entertainment Weekly criticized [...] "Britney's {{complete}} lack of verbal audience interaction [...] and her obviously diminished dancing ability" [...] but also added that [...] "with her slim waist, her dangerously toned legs, and most importantly her engaged, wide-eyed smile, [...] looked happy to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> us—the crucial element that has been missing from so many Britney shows of late." [...] August Brown of the Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "the Femme Fatale tour gets its drama by largely erasing— or at least tweaking— the past. [...] Spears manipulates pop's virgin-whore complex better than just about anyone, and her seamless sweep from lasciviously grinding on an awestruck dude from the audience to the earnest balladry of 'Don’t Let Me Be the Last to Know' [...] felt true to the sweep of her career— she learned that she can control the narrative by vanishing into a club's heat or into literal thin air." [...] Matt Kivel of Variety commented, [...] "Though visually impressive, the show lacked a truly engaging human quality. Spears moved with an almost mechanical detachment, lightly shifting through dance routines without fully letting her body release itself. With her voice heavily processed and laden with backing tracks, she appeared onstage as some strange blend of Michael Jackson, Madonna and Kraftwerk's Ralf and Florian." [...] However, Jam! Canoe considered the show was [...] "best described as Janet Jackson-like." ...|$|E

The customer commented to Heeringa that she shouldn't be alone that {{late at night}} and that her boyfriend should <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> her. She said a man overheard the women's conversation and said, [...] "She's got her customers looking out for her too." [...] She said that Heeringa [...] "sort of shook her head and started shivering ... like a chill went up her spine or something." [...] She then said Heeringa [...] "wasn't her usual happy self" [...] and she felt that [...] "something was wrong", so she parked outside the station until it closed.

2500|$|The Beatles {{recorded}} [...] "Think for Yourself" [...] {{towards the}} end of the sessions for Rubber Soul, at which point they were under pressure to meet the deadline for completing the album. Recording for the song, which had a working title of [...] "Won't <b>Be</b> <b>There</b> <b>With</b> You", took place at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London on 8 November 1965. The group achieved a satisfactory basic track in one take, with a line-up comprising two electric guitars, bass guitar and drums. Lennon's guitar contribution does not appear on the completed recording, however. Instead, he overdubbed a keyboard part, played on either a Vox Continental organ or an electric piano.|$|E

I still feel that I have to earn a player's trust before they can play my music.

2500|$|Bon Iver's [...] "Perth" [...] was {{inspired}} by Heath Ledger. Justin Vernon, the lead singer and songwriter of the American indie folk band, revealed back in 2011 that he had begun working on the song in 2008 and was scheduled {{to meet with a}} music video director who was good friends with Ledger, Matt Amato. [...] "The first thing I worked on, the riff and the beginning melodies, was the first song on the record, 'Perth,'" [...] Vernon told Exclaim!. Amato was directing the band's [...] "The Wolves (Act I & II)" [...] music video the day that Ledger died. [...] "It was no longer about just making a Bon Iver music video anymore," [...] Vernon says. [...] "This was now our chance to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> Matt as he grieved.

On 20 July 1969, Sweethearts on Parade were performing for about 75 US Marines at a Non-commissioned officer's club 7km (4mi) south-east of Da Nang in South Vietnam. At about 9:15p.m., Wayne had just finished a song and was still on stage to introduce her fellow performers when she was shot in the chest by a bullet fired from a [...]22 pistol, fitted with a silencer, which had been stolen at the base. Wayne died almost instantly as the bullet severed her aorta. In Entertaining Vietnam, a 2003 documentary directed and produced by Mara Wallis, Taylor was interviewed on the events of Wayne's death, footage of a Sweethearts on Parade performance with Wayne singing was shown (see screenshot at left). Taylor recalled that he was sitting about a metre (three feet) behind Wayne and that Cavanagh had stepped forward to cradle his fiancée when she slumped to the floor.|$|E

Bush called the man who served under her husband, [...] "a devoted husband and father." [...] The next day, April 20, 1995, the Bushes were scheduled to go to Tulsa, Oklahoma. Barbara was supposed to speak at a Junior League event in the noon and accompany her husband at the Salvation Army annual dinner. The Bushes debated whether or not they should continue with their plans due to the bombing, ultimately deciding to go because [...] "both groups help people in need." [...] On September 3, 1995, the Bushes went to Vietnam. This was [...] "unbelievable" [...] to Barbara because she [...] "never expected to set foot in what had been North Vietnam." [...] The Bushes first went to Hanoi and then to Ho Chi Minh City. The Bushes met with President Lê Đức Anh and party secretary Đỗ Mười. On September 28, 1995, the Bushes drove to Portland, Maine for the announcement of the Barbara Bush Children's Hospital. Bush said her life was being stretched, adding, [...] "Long after I am gone this hospital will <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> my name."
