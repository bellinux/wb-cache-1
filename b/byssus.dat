5|$|In all molluscs, {{the mantle}} forms a thin {{membrane}} {{that covers the}} animal's body and extends out from it in flaps or lobes. In bivalves, the mantle lobes secrete the valves, and the mantle crest secretes the whole hinge mechanism consisting of ligament, <b>byssus</b> threads (where present), and teeth.|$|E
5|$|Sea silk is a {{fine fabric}} woven from the <b>byssus</b> threads of bivalves, {{particularly}} the pen shell (Pinna nobilis). It used to be produced in the Mediterranean region where these shells are endemic. It was an expensive fabric and overfishing has much reduced populations of the pen shell. There is mention in the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone (196 BCE) of this cloth being used to pay taxes.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs {{crack the}} shells with their pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by <b>byssus</b> threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{mechanical}} {{analysis was}} used to record the behaviour of hydrated and dehydrated byssal threads under tensile stress and during dynamic thermal cycling. Fresh <b>byssi,</b> and <b>byssi</b> aged two weeks prior to testing, were used to further study the effects of age on the mechanical properties of this material. It was found that while older threads demonstrated increased stiffness, age did not necessarily affect their ultimate tensile strength. Dehydration had a more pronounced effect on thread stiffness and also increased the ultimate strength of the material. In their dry state, byssal threads displayed multiple yield points under tension and these, it is suggested, could equate to different phases within the bulk of the material. Dynamic analysis revealed glass transition (Tg) and ecologically relevant operational temperatures for <b>byssi,</b> where their modulus (E′) remained constant. These discoveries are related to the ecological function of byssal threads and to the emerging field of biomimetics...|$|R
50|$|The {{adult male}} and female {{nematode}} mate in spring or summer. The male then dies and the female remains in the soil through fall and winter. During the following spring or summer the female emerges after a rainfall event while the landscape is still wet, often early in the morning. It then climbs vegetation, sometimes reaching 2 or 3 meters above the ground. It lays its eggs on plants. The eggs are dark brown or reddish, and are about half a millimeter long. The eggs attach to the plant via filaments called <b>byssi.</b> They are consumed by herbivores along with the plant tissue.|$|R
40|$|The dark falsemussel Mytilopsis leucophaeata (Conrad, 1831) (Dreissenidae) is an {{uncommon}} epifaunal bivalve of oligohaline–mesohaline habitats in Chesapeake Bay. It {{is small and}} weakly attached to different substrates by its <b>byssi,</b> but is presumably somewhat protected from predators by its habit of living within byssate clumps of hooked mussels Ischadium recurvum (Rafinesque, 1820) attached to eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin, 1791). It is less active than I. recurvum in terms of crawling from under encumbrances or moving and reattaching when detached from a substrate. Its extensible inhalant siphon should enable it to obtain food and oxygen from the water column even when con-fined within I. recurvum clumps or its own single-species clumps. In terms of egg size and the timing of larval development, it shares a number of characteristics with the freshwater dreissenids Dreissena poly-morpha and D. rostriformis bugensis and with I. recurvum. Given the limited numbers of M. leucophaeata {{that seem to be}} the rule in its native habitat, there are questions, so far unanswered, as to how the population persists, how its spawning is coordinated and how successful is fertilization when widely separated individuals do spawn...|$|R
5|$|The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature {{states that}} names of fungi adopted by Fries in Systema Mycologicum vols. 1–3 are sanctioned, that is, they are conserved against earlier {{homonyms}} and competing synonyms. This {{means that the}} name Hypochnus rubrocinctum has priority over <b>Byssus</b> sanguinea. The type material of H.rubrocinctum was examined by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in Berlin; it has since been destroyed, probably during the Second World War. The drawing in Erhenberg's 1820 publication serves as the lectotype. The species {{was transferred to the}} genus Cryptothecia by Swedish lichenologist Göran Thor in 1991, {{on the basis of its}} similarity with C.striata such as the thallus with radiate ridges, granular isidia, and presence of para-depsides (gyrophoric acid in C.striata and confluentic acid in C.rubrocincta).|$|E
5|$|Near {{the hinge}} {{of the shell}} is the umbo, often a rounded, knob-like {{protuberance}} usually surrounding the beak. The umbo generally and the beak specifically represent the oldest portion of the shell, with extra material gradually being laid down along the margins on the opposite sides. The hinge point or line is the dorsal region of the shell, and the lower, curved margin is the ventral region. The anterior or front of the shell is where the <b>byssus</b> (when present) and foot are located, and the posterior of the shell is where the siphons are located. With the umbones/ hinge uppermost and with the anterior edge of the animal towards the viewer's left, the valve facing the viewer is the left valve and the opposing valve the right.|$|E
5|$|The rate {{of growth}} of the Antarctic scallop is very slow {{compared}} to that of scallops living in warmer seas. It matures at 5 to 7 years old and spawning takes place in late summer. Little is known about the development of the veliger larvae but they may be planktonic for 4 or 5 months. Besides feeding on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, they may absorb dissolved organic matter and consume bacterioplankton. When they settle, metamorphosis takes place and the juveniles attach themselves with <b>byssus</b> threads, often attaching these to the upper valves of scallops, and remain attached for 3 to 5 years. While attached to the adult shell, the juveniles benefit from food particles in the fine detritus thrown up into the water column by movements of the adult. While studying the sizes and growth rates of adults, researchers came to realize that there were gaps in their records which were due to the fact that, in some years, no juveniles had survived.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell is}} {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, {{as is the case}} in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite. Sometimes, the aragonite forms an inner, nacreous layer, {{as is the case in}} the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are laid down. The ligament and <b>byssus,</b> if calcified, are composed of aragonite. The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum, a skin-like layer which {{is composed of}} a conchiolin. The periostracum is secreted in the groove between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded. The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop anchors {{itself to}} the {{substrate}} with a few <b>byssus</b> threads. It is unclear what {{the purpose of these}} is but they may serve to help orient the scallop with regard to the current for optimal feeding. Another possibility is that they may angle the scallop ready for a quick getaway. They are easily broken when the scallop starts to swim. It is a filter feeder. It exposes its mantle by separating its valves and passes water through its gills by ciliary action. A large scallop can process about 4 litres of water an hour per gram of its weight. Phytoplankton are sieved from the water by the gills and moved to the mouth in ciliated grooves. Here they are sorted by a pair of labial palps (mouth appendages), before being ingested. Rejected particles are formed into mucous-wrapped blobs. These are ejected from the mantle cavity at intervals along with the faeces by a rapid clapping of the valves. When the gonads are ripening, a raised level of microalgae in the diet has been found to increase gonadal development. At this time, glycogen storage in the main adductor muscle is depleted as energy is transferred from there to the gonads.|$|E
25|$|Marine mussels {{are usually}} found {{clumping}} together on wave-washed rocks, each {{attached to the}} rock by its <b>byssus.</b> The clumping habit helps hold the mussels firm against {{the force of the}} waves. At low tide mussels {{in the middle of a}} clump will undergo less water loss because of water capture by the other mussels.|$|E
25|$|Wild silk, cocoons {{collected}} from the wild after the insect had eaten its way out, was also known; being of shorter smaller lengths, its fibres had to be spun into somewhat thicker yarn than the cultivated variety. A rare luxury cloth with a beautiful golden sheen, known as sea silk, was made from the long silky filaments or <b>byssus</b> produced by Pinna nobilis, a large Mediterranean clam.|$|E
25|$|This mussel is {{native to}} the Pacific Ocean from Siberia to Singapore, {{but it has also}} been accidentally {{introduced}} and become an invasive species in numerous other areas worldwide. It can live in the intertidal or shallow subtidal zones. In California the species has been recorded in densities of up to 150,000 individuals per square meter. It grows quickly and lives only about 2 years. It prefers soft substrates and surrounds its shell in a dense mass of <b>byssus.</b>|$|E
25|$|In marine mussels, {{the foot}} is smaller, tongue-like in shape, with a groove on the ventral surface which is {{continuous}} with the <b>byssus</b> pit. In this pit, a viscous secretion is exuded, entering the groove and hardening gradually upon contact with sea water. This forms extremely tough, strong, elastic, byssal threads that secure the mussel to its substrate {{allowing it to}} remain sessile in areas of high flow. The byssal thread is also sometimes used by mussels as a defensive measure, to tether predatory molluscs, such as dog whelks, that invade mussel beds, immobilising them and thus starving them to death.|$|E
500|$|The mantle {{suspender}} muscles {{attach the}} mantle to the shell and leave an arc-shaped scar {{on the inside}} of the valve, the pallial line. [...] The paired pedal protractor and retractor muscles operate the animal's foot. Some bivalves, such as oysters and most scallops, are unable to extend their foot and in them, these muscles are absent. Other paired muscles control the siphons and the <b>byssus.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Antarctic scallop is {{endemic to}} the waters {{surrounding}} Antarctica. These are mostly within the Antarctic Circle and include the Ross Sea, the Weddell Sea, the Davis Sea, McMurdo Sound and the Southern Ocean. Although {{it is commonly}} found at depths of less than , remotely operated underwater vehicles armed with lights and cameras have recorded the scallop at much greater depths, including one recording at [...] It is found on many different substrates including sand, gravel and silt, either on the surface or semi-submerged in the sediment. It can flap its gills slightly to create a hollow in which to settle. In shallow waters it is usually attached by <b>byssus</b> threads to hard surfaces {{so as not to}} be swept away by water movement. At greater depths it is usually free living.|$|E
500|$|Other bivalves, such as mussels, attach {{themselves}} to hard surfaces using tough <b>byssus</b> threads made of keratin and proteins. They are more exposed to attack by predators than the burrowing bivalves. Certain carnivorous gastropod snails such as whelks (Buccinidae) and murex snails (Muricidae) feed on bivalves by boring into their shells, although many Busyconine whelks (e.g., Busycon sinistrum, Busycon carica) are [...] "chipping-style" [...] predators. The dog whelk (Nucella lamellosa) drills a hole with its radula assisted by a shell-dissolving secretion. The dog whelk then inserts its extendible proboscis and sucks out the body {{contents of the}} victim, which is typically a blue mussel. The whelk needs {{a few hours to}} penetrate the shell and thus living in the littoral zone is an advantage to the bivalve because the gastropod can attempt to bore through the shell only when the tide is in.|$|E
500|$|Other {{luxury and}} high-status {{products}} {{were made from}} molluscs. Tyrian purple, made from the ink glands of murex shells, [...] "...fetched its weight in silver" [...] {{in the fourth century}} BC, according to Theopompus. The discovery of large numbers of Murex shells on Crete suggests the Minoans may have pioneered the extraction of [...] "imperial purple" [...] during the Middle Minoan period in the 20th–18th centuries BC, centuries before the Tyrians. Sea silk is a fine, rare, and valuable fabric produced from the long silky threads (<b>byssus)</b> secreted by several bivalve molluscs, particularly Pinna nobilis, to attach themselves to the sea bed. Procopius, writing on the Persian wars circa 550 CE, [...] "stated that the five hereditary satraps (governors) of Armenia who received their insignia from the Roman Emperor were given chlamys (or cloaks) made from lana pinna. Apparently, only the ruling classes were allowed to wear these chlamys." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scallops {{are mostly}} {{free-living}} and active, unlike {{the vast majority}} of bivalves, which are mostly slow-moving and infaunal. It is believed that all scallops start out with a <b>byssus,</b> which attaches them to some form of substrate such as eelgrass when they are very young. Most species lose the <b>byssus</b> as they grow larger. A very few species go on to cement themselves to a hard substrate (e.g. Chlamys distorta and Hinnites multirigosus).|$|E
2500|$|In cooking, the <b>byssus</b> of the mussel {{is known}} as the [...] "beard" [...] and is removed before the mussels are prepared.|$|E
2500|$|Once an egg is fertilized, {{it is then}} planktonic, {{which is}} a {{collection}} of microorganisms that drift abundantly in fresh or salt water. [...] Larvae stay in the water column for the next four to seven weeks before dissipating to the ocean floor, where they attach themselves to objects through <b>byssus</b> threads. <b>Byssus</b> is eventually lost with adulthood, transitioning almost all scallop species into free swimmers. There is rapid growth within the first several years, with an increase of 50 to 80% in shell height and quadrupled size in meat weight and reach commercial size at about four to five years of age. The lifespans of some scallops have been known to extend over 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|Freshwater zebra mussels {{and their}} {{relatives}} in the family Dreissenidae {{are not related to}} previously mentioned groups, even though they resemble many Mytilus species in shape, and live attached to rocks and other hard surfaces in a similar manner, using a <b>byssus.</b> They are classified with the Heterodonta, the taxonomic group which includes most of the bivalves commonly referred to as [...] "clams".|$|E
2500|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, mussel farmers collect {{naturally}} occurring marine mussel seed for transfer to more appropriate growing areas, however, most North American mussel farmers rely on hatchery-produced seed. Growers typically purchase seed after it has set (about 1mm in size) or after it has been nursed in upwellers for 3-6 additional weeks and is 2-3mm. The seed is then typically reared in a nursery environment, where it is transferred to a material with a suitable surface for later relocation to the growing area. After about three months in the nursery, mussel seed is [...] "socked" [...] (placed in a tube-like mesh material) and hung on longlines or rafts for grow-out. Within a few days, the mussels migrate to the outside of the sock for better access food sources in the water column. Mussels grow quickly and are usually ready for harvest in less than two years. Unlike other cultured bivalves, mussels use <b>byssus</b> threads (beard) to attach themselves to any firm substrate, which makes them suitable for a number of culture methods.|$|E

60|$|Exclusively, therefore, for the {{purposes}} of illustration, I would take as an instance of the first step, the metals, those, namely, that are capable of permanent reduction. For, by the established laws of nomenclature, the others (as sodium, potassium, calcium, silicium, &c.) would be entitled to a class of their own, under the name of bases. It is long since the chemists have despaired of decomposing this class of bodies. They still remain, one and all, as elements or simple bodies, though, on the principles of the corpuscularian philosophy, nothing can be more improbable than that they really are such; and no reason has or can be assigned on the grounds of that system, why, in no one instance, the contrary has not been proved. But this is at once explained, if we assume them as the simplest form of unity, namely, the unity of powers and properties. For these, it is evident, may be endlessly modified, but can never be decomposed. If I were asked by a philosopher who had previously extended the attribute of Life to the <b>Byssus</b> speciosa, and even to the crustaceous matter, or outward bones of a lobster, &c., whether the ingot of gold expressed life, I should answer without hesitation, as the ingot of gold assuredly not, for its form is accidental and ab extra. It may be added to or detracted from without in the least affecting the nature, state, or properties in the specific matter of which the ingot consists. But as gold, as that special union of absolute and of relative gravity, ductility, and hardness, which, wherever they are found, constitute gold, I should answer no less fearlessly, in the affirmative. But I should further add, that of the two counteracting tendencies of nature, namely, that of detachment from the universal life, which universality is represented to us by gravitation, and that of attachment or reduction into it, this and the other noble metals represented the units in which the latter tendency, namely, that of identity with the life of nature, subsisted in the greatest overbalance over the former. It is the form of unity with the least degree of tendency to individuation.|$|E
