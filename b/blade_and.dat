Changing {{the shapes of the}} <b>blades</b> <b>and</b> vanes and increasing gaps between <b>blades</b> <b>and</b> annuli both help reduce engine fuel efficiency and operability.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{our research}} toward {{the design and}} de-velopment of a library of electronic hardware modules called <b>Blades</b> <b>and</b> Tiles. Interaction hardware design with <b>blades</b> <b>and</b> tiles provides researchers with considerable flexibility in iterating their designs, decoupling between the domains of electronics, software, firmware and mechanical design. Our approach {{has been driven by}} design objectives including hardware reusability, reliability, scalability, and flexibility. We have created a library of <b>blades</b> <b>and</b> tiles, and used them to develop several interaction devices. We present both con-ceptual and applied aspects and discuss future directions.

5|$|A short {{original}} video animation series {{based on}} Mystery of the Emblem {{was created in}} 1997. These anime episodes were released in North America, six years before The Sword of Flame was localized. Amiibo figures based on Fire Emblem characters were produced, which are compatible with Fates, Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. Manga based on the games have also been produced, including Binding <b>Blade</b> <b>and</b> Awakening. A trading card game, titled Fire Emblem 0 (Cipher), based on the series is also available in Japan, featuring character artwork by old and new artists.|$|E

5|$|TowerFall was Thorson's first {{commercial}} game. It followed from a June 2012 game jam single-player prototype. Thorson tested {{the game on}} his indie developer colleagues with whom he lived, and developed its capacity as a party game. Its mechanics were inspired by games of Thorson's youth, such as Bushido <b>Blade</b> <b>and</b> GoldenEye 007, and influenced by demo feedback at the Evolution Championship Series fighting game tournament. TowerFall {{was known as the}} standout title for the Ouya at the console's launch, and sold well. When the Ouya exclusivity expired, Thorson signed another exclusivity agreement for the PlayStation 4, where Ascension received an expanded single-player mode, and new levels, weapons, and gameplay variants. A PlayStation Vita release followed in 2015 and an Xbox One version is in development. A standalone eight-player edition for Windows released in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are usually {{based on a}} dump truck chassis, which are then converted into winter {{service vehicles}} either by the manufacturer or an aftermarket third-party. A typical modification involves the replacement of steel components of the vehicle with corrosion resistant aluminium or fibreglass, waterproofing any exposed electronic components, replacement of the stock hopper with a specially designed gritting body, {{the addition of a}} plow frame, reinforcement of the wheels, bumpers to support the heavy <b>blade,</b> <b>and</b> the addition of extra headlamps, a light bar, and retroreflectors for visibility.|$|E

5|$|Zoe {{is taken}} in by a priest who has become Malus' new host. He gives her a blade which was once Satan's sword and tells her she will bear the antichrist. Zoe kills the priest, and Malus moves through several more hosts. Zoe reunites with Rachel and the others, and they decide to work with Lilith to stop Malus. Overcome by her {{inevitable}} role {{in the end of}} the world, Zoe cuts her own throat. While Rachel tries to save Zoe's life, Lilith takes her <b>blade</b> <b>and</b> confronts Malus's new host. Malus resists, and his host is killed. As he leaves the body, Lilith stabs him with the blade, condemning him to Hell.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} over the effects of running blade length arose at the 2012 Paralympic Games, as Brazilian runner Alan Oliveira and USA runner Blake Leeper changed to longer running blades {{within a few months}} before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the IPC rules, regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned. His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including Jerome Singleton and Jack Swift, who called for the T43 double <b>blade</b> <b>and</b> T44 single blade classes to be separated in future events, as single blade runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade.|$|E
5|$|Antioch was Diocletian's primary {{residence}} from 299 to 302, while Galerius swapped {{places with}} his Augustus on the Middle and Lower Danube. Diocletian visited Egypt once, {{over the winter}} of 301–2, and issued a grain dole in Alexandria. Following some public disputes with Manicheans, Diocletian ordered that the leading followers of Mani be burnt alive along with their scriptures. In a 31 March 302 rescript from Alexandria, he declared that low-status Manicheans must be executed by the <b>blade,</b> <b>and</b> high-status Manicheans must be sent {{to work in the}} quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island, Turkey) or the mines of Phaeno in southern Palestine. All Manichean property was to be seized and deposited in the imperial treasury. Diocletian found much to be offended by in Manichean religion: its novelty, its alien origins, the way it corrupted the morals of the Roman race, and its inherent opposition to long-standing religious traditions. Manichaeanism was also supported by Persia at the time, compounding religious dissent with international politics. Excepting Persian support, the reasons he disliked Manichaenism were equally applicable, if not more so, to Christianity, his next target.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, Chevalier Jackson was {{the first}} to report a high rate of success for the use of direct {{laryngoscopy}} as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope. Also in 1913, New York surgeon Henry H. Janeway (1873–1921) published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed. Another pioneer in this field was Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986), who developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation, the Magill forceps, the Magill laryngoscope <b>blade,</b> <b>and</b> several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill. Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) introduced a curved laryngoscope blade in 1943; the Macintosh blade remains to this day the most widely used laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation.|$|E
5|$|In 19th Century Russia, Vladimir Durfe (Mark Damon) {{is a young}} nobleman {{who finds}} a {{beheaded}} corpse with a knife plunged into its heart. He takes the <b>blade,</b> <b>and</b> finds shelter in a small cottage. Durfe is approached by Giorgio (Glauco Onorato) who explains that the knife belongs to his father, {{who has not been}} seen for five days. Giorgio offers a room to Durfe and introduces him {{to the rest of the}} family: his wife (Rika Dialina), their young son Ivan, Giorgio's younger brother Pietro (Massimo Righi), and sister Sdenka (Susy Andersen). They all await the return of Gorca, who has gone to fight the wurdalak, a living cadaver who feeds on human blood, especially of close friends and family members. At midnight, Gorca (Boris Karloff) returns to the cottage with a sour demeanor and unkempt appearance. After the family goes to sleep, Ivan and Pietro are attacked by Gorca who flees the cottage with Ivan. Giorgio chases after Gorca but only returns with Ivan's corpse. Giorgio plans to stake and behead Ivan to prevent him from reviving as a Wurdalak, but is prevented from doing so by his wife. The two agree to give their son a burial.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Chaos, {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around his wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. A new weapons mechanic called the World Weapon system allows Kratos to pick up weapons scattered throughout game locations or to take them from defeated foes, and to use these for a limited time. There are five World Weapons (sword, club, javelin, sling, shield) that can be collected randomly, although Kratos may possess only one at any time. When a World Weapon is not equipped, Kratos may punch or kick foes {{as part of the}} new combat system. Another new mechanic is that Kratos can tether enemies, referred to as grappling; he can hold an enemy in place with one blade while he attacks other enemies with the other <b>blade,</b> <b>and</b> he can throw the tethered enemy.|$|E

5|$|Kratos, the new God of War, {{is still}} haunted by nightmares {{of his past}} and is shunned by the other gods for his {{destructive}} ways. Ignoring Athena's warnings, Kratos joins the Spartan army in an attack on Rhodes, during which a giant eagle suddenly drains him of his powers and animates the Colossus of Rhodes. While battling the statue, Zeus offers Kratos the Blade of Olympus in order to defeat it, requiring Kratos to infuse the blade with {{the remainder of his}} godly power. Although now human, Kratos defeats the Colossus but is mortally wounded. The eagle reveals itself to have been Zeus all along, who states he was forced to intervene as Athena refused to do so. Zeus then grants Kratos a final opportunity to be loyal to the gods, but Kratos refuses. Zeus kills him with the <b>blade</b> <b>and</b> destroys the Spartan army.|$|E
5|$|The Briscoe Brothers {{returned}} to ROH at the Fourth Anniversary Show in 2006, forcibly including {{themselves in a}} match that was at first between the teams of Tony Mamaluke and Sal Rinauro and Jason <b>Blade</b> <b>and</b> Kid Mikaze. They won in their re-debut. They then feuded for the tag team championship again, but much as they had against Styles and Red three years earlier, they lost in three shots against the champions at the time, Austin Aries and Roderick Strong, at Ring of Homicide, Destiny, and Unified. As before, the storyline was that this cost them any chance at the belts {{for as long as}} those champs held them. It was around this time that the Brothers became enforcers for Jim Cornette's heel character as ROH Commissioner, fighting battles against his enemies, most notably Homicide and his partner Samoa Joe at Glory By Honor V: Night Two and in anything goes, falls count anywhere, elimination match at Dethroned. During this time, they also feuded with Kenta and his partners Davey Richards and Naomichi Marufuji, facing Kenta and Richards at Time to Man Up and Kenta and Marufuji at Glory By Honor V: Night One.|$|E
5|$|The {{delayed release}} of Odin Sphere led to {{issues with the}} company: they needed to start other {{projects}} to keep their company going, leading {{to the development of}} GrimGrimoire. The development of GrimGrimoire drained the company's funds, forcing Kamitani to take out a flexible loan of 20 million yen to keep the company afloat and fund development for their next projects, in addition to finding these projects new publishers as Atlus refused to take any more of Vanillaware's products until they had seen how Odin Sphere performed commercially. Nippon Ichi Software would handle GrimGrimoire, while Marvelous Entertainment accepted their next project, Muramasa: The Demon Blade for the Wii. The commercial success of Odin Sphere both enabled the development of Muramasa: The Demon <b>Blade</b> <b>and</b> cleared Kamitani's debt. In tandem with their other titles, Odin Sphere helped establish Vanillaware as a respected developer.|$|E
