50|$|Seibel grapes are a {{group of}} wine grape {{varieties}} which originated {{with the work of}} Albert Seibel crossing European grape with American grape species to increase disease resistance. They were planted widely in France during the 1950s but have seen decline in recent years because French wine law proscribes hybrid grapes in appellation wine. The grapes are still commonly used as <b>blending</b> grapes in <b>table</b> wine and mass commercial wines. New Zealand, England, and Canada also have plantings of Seibel grapes.|$|R

Professors Avraham and Yuracko’s fine article, Torts and Discrimination, calls {{our attention to}} the fact that the entrenched fact of race and gender discrimination exerts a powerful, structural influence on tort damages, especially in bodily injury and wrongful death cases. Damages in tort—and in private law more generally—are reparative. Their role is to put the plaintiff in the position he would have been in but for the defendant’s wrong. Making the plaintiff whole requires that courts determine how the plaintiff’s life would have gone had she not been wrongly harmed. State of the art methods for doing incorporate the effects of objectionable racial and gender discrimination and carry those effects forward. The life expectancy, work-life expectancy, and average wage tables are tailored to the circumstances of men and Caucasians, the more they reflect the legacy of long-term race and gender discrimination and the more they project past discrimination forward. Like a Gordian knot, this problem is difficult to untangle, but easy to cut through. We might end this practice of projecting past discrimination forward by using blended life expectancy, work-life expectancy, and average wage expectancy tables, instead of tailored ones. Administratively, this is a simple change. Judges haves the authority to require the use of <b>blended</b> <b>tables</b> and the tables are there for the using. The hard questions that this remedy raises are not practical or administrative, but theoretical and normative. Why is tort law drawn to project past discrimination forward? And how deeply embedded, normatively, is its commitment to doing so? This Comment argues that the feature of tort law at work here is basic, but not backed by immense normative weight. The feature at issue is central to the law of torts because reparation is central to tort and the use of tailored tables furthers reparation. However, reparation mechanisms which undermine equal right themselves offend important tort values, and cannot claim strong support from justified reliance...|$|R
40|$|The damping {{properties}} of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber/Norsorex® blends were investigated by dynamic mechanical analysis. The effects of Norsorex on the {{damping properties}} of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber/Norsorex blends were also studied. The {{results showed that}} 30 -phr Norsorex could dramatically improve the damping of 70 -phr acrylonitrile butadiene rubber. Compared with acrylonitrile butadiene rubber, the LA value of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber/Norsorex[*]=[*] 70 / 30 increased to 7. 3 [*]×[*] 108 from 3. 0 [*]×[*] 108 [*]Pa[*]K and the TA value increased from 26. 6 to 28. 4 [*]K. To test the new high-damping-performance <b>blends,</b> shaking <b>table</b> tests on a four-story steel frame with viscoelastic damping wall were designed and the simulations were provided for verification. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} viscoelastic damping wall controlled the inter-story displacement well under apg[*]=[*] 7 [*]m/s 2, which exceeded the specified limit under uncontrolled conditions. The viscoelastic damping wall showed a better control effect on the displacement response than on the acceleration response subjected to El Centro ground motion for the second to fourth stories. The simulation results of SAP 2000 structural analysis software showed good agreement with the experimental results. The differences between the acceleration and displacement time-history responses of the steel frame with acrylonitrile butadiene rubber and acrylonitrile butadiene rubber/Norsorex (70 / 30) were simulated by SAP 2000...|$|R
40|$|The third {{edition of}} the North Western Waters (NWW) Atlas is a joint {{publication}} between the Marine Institute and the NWW Advisory Council. This Atlas is intended for policy makers, managers and interested stakeholders and aims to provide a broad overview of the ecosystem of the NWW Advisory Council (AC) area. We have {{tried to make the}} science as clear and concise as possible, and keep technical language to a minimum. The information has been presented through a <b>blend</b> of text, <b>tables,</b> figures and images. There is a glossary of terms and a list of more detailed scientific references for those interested in following up certain issues. The first and second editions of the Atlas, published in 2009 and 2011 respectively under the MEFEPO project, were extremely well received and this new edition has been modified in response to stakeholder feedback to provide updated information on the physical and chemical features, habitat types, biological features, birds, mammals, fishing activity and other human activities taking place within the NWW region. We have received valuable contributions from non-governmental organisations, which use citizen science to collect information on the marine ecosystem around us. Whenever citizen science is used to complement the existing knowledge, this is clearly marked in the relevant sections. The North Western Waters (NWW) area is situated in the north east Atlantic off the west coast of Ireland and Scotland, and extends into the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and the English Channel.

40|$|Palm stearin {{has limited}} {{application}} in natural form {{because of its}} high melting point, low plasticity and hence cannot be used directly in margarine production. Palm kernel oil contains short and medium triacylglycerols that can give desired melting characteristics and ensures the stable beta prime (P') polymorph in products. To enhance the PS compatibility, {{it needs to be}} blended and/or interesterified with soybean oil to impart desirable properties to the final products. Blends of PS, PKO and SBO at certain proportions were formulated using a mixture design (Design Expert 8. 0. 4, 2010). All the 10 oil blends were subjected to chemical and enzymatic interesterification. The physicochemical, thermal, polymorphism, microstructural, textural properties and kinetics of isothermal crystallisation were studied. The interesterified (IE) blends had lower slip melting points and solid fat contents due to the randomisation in the TAGs. Interesterification also promotes significant alterations in the microstructural and polymorphism of blends, resulted in smaller crystals with P' form. The hardness of interesterified blends were reduced following the reaction. Interesterification also altered the mechanism of crystallisation kinetics of the blends, depending on the composition and the crystallisation temperatures. The optimisation of interesterified ternary <b>blends</b> for trans-free <b>table</b> (TM) and soft margarine (SM) formulations were conducted through graphical multiple responses in Design-Expert. The CIE and EIE for the TM formulation showed slightly different proportions of PS/PKO/SBO with 50 / 18 / 32 and 50 / 22 / 28 (w/w), while for SM formulation, both the interesterified blends give the same proportions of 51 / 0 / 49 (w/w) of PS/PKO/SBO...|$|R
40|$|Selenium, an {{essential}} micromineral, is a co-factor of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase. This enzyme {{is involved in}} cell membrane protection against oxidative damage resulting from reactive oxygen species production. Besides the importance of preservation of unsaturated fatty acids in fish, world aquaculture has been seeking for alternative oil sources in diet of fish. Thus, the main goal of this research work was to study the antioxidant capacity of meagre (Argyrossomus regius) fed with different levels of vegetable blend oil with and without selenium in replacement of traditional diets containing fish oil. Meagre (600 animals) were kept in 24 tanks (80 L) with constant renovation and aeration and maintained at 20. 7 ± 0. 7 ºC and oxygen 8. 8 ± 1. 7 mg L - 1. Fish were fed twice per day, six days per week, with eight different experimental diets for 60 days. Diets were formulated to have two different oil sources (fish or vegetable blend oils with 45 % of linseed, 35 % of rapeseed and 20 % of soybean oil), two lipid levels (12 and 17 %) and two selenium supplementation (0 and 1 mg/kg diet). Lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), total glutathione (TG) and catalase (CAT) were analyzed in liver of fish. CAT, GPx and GR activities were not significantly altered in fish fed with diets with different oil sources. However, TG in fish fed with fish oil diet was higher than the levels observed in fish fed with vegetable blend oil. Furthermore, fish fed with fish oil diet showed lower lipid peroxidation when compared with fish fed vegetable <b>blend</b> oil diet (<b>Table</b> 1). Concerning the oil level in diet, {{it was observed that}} fish fed with a diet of 17 % lipids had a higher level of total glutathione when compared to fish fed with a diet of 12 % lipids. On the other hand, the fish fed with a diet with 12 % lipids showed lower levels of lipid peroxidation when compared to fish fed with a diet of 17 % lipids. Fish fed with diets supplemented with selenium showed a significantly increased activity of GPx when compared with fish fed without selenium. Three-way ANOVA analysis showed that dietary lipid level and the presence of selenium have a significant interaction on the activities of CAT and GR, as well as, levels of TG and LPO. A significant interaction between the source of oil and the presence of selenium on GR activities was observed. Interaction on source and level was observed to CAT. In conclusion, the antioxidant capacity of meagre is influenced by the source of oil, the level of lipids and the presence of selenium in their diet. </p...|$|R
