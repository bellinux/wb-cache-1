50|$|The <b>Blackberry</b> <b>Jams</b> is a {{collection}} of private recordings made by Jason Becker between 1987 and 1988.|$|R
25|$|Several years later, Becker {{released}} Raspberry <b>Jams</b> (1999) and <b>Blackberry</b> <b>Jams</b> (2003); {{the first}} contained various unreleased demo-tracks, {{and the latter}} contained demo-tracks and alternate versions of songs that were later reworked and published into other albums.|$|R
2500|$|Becker {{started out}} playing {{alongside}} Marty Friedman in the Mike Varney-produced duo, [...] Cacophony. Together, {{they put out}} an album, and toured Japan and the U.S.. While they never went mainstream in the U.S., Europeans embraced their music and they sold out almost everywhere they went. [...] In 1989 Friedman left to join Megadeth and Becker began to pursue a solo career, having released his first solo album titled 'Perpetual Burn' in 1988, and has since released Perspective and Collection, {{as well as two}} albums of demos, entitled The Raspberry <b>Jams</b> and The <b>Blackberry</b> <b>Jams.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Hare found {{eating and}} resting to be matters of {{profound}} enjoyment. Before {{he had fallen}} in with these good people {{it had been a}} year since he had sat down to a full meal; longer still since he had eaten whole some food. And now he had come to a [...] "land overflowing with milk and honey," [...] as Mother Ruth smilingly said. He could not choose between roast beef and chicken, and so he waived the question by taking both; and what with the biscuits and butter, apple-sauce and <b>blackberry</b> <b>jam,</b> cherry pie and milk like cream, there was danger of making himself ill. He told his friends that he simply could not help it, which shameless confession brought a hearty laugh from August and beaming smiles from his women-folk.|$|E
60|$|Supper that night, {{even if we}} did grind {{sand with}} our teeth, was a joyous occasion. The {{biscuits}} were flaky and light; the bacon fragrant and crisp. I produced a jar of <b>blackberry</b> <b>jam,</b> which by subtle cunning I {{had been able to}} secrete from the Mormons on that dry desert ride, and it was greeted with acclamations of pleasure. Wallace, divested of his sand guise, beamed with the gratification of a hungry man once more in the presence of friends and food. He made large cavities in Jim's great pot of potato stew, and caused biscuits to vanish {{in a way that would}} not have shamed a Hindoo magician. The Grand Canyon he dug in my jar of jam, however, could not have been accomplished by legerdemain.|$|E

40|$|In this work, fruit derived juices, nectars and jams enriched with inulin were developed, using {{pulp and}} {{concentrate}} produced from tubers of Jerusalem artichoke. The products developed included juices and nectars (orange, sour cherry and apple) {{as well as}} <b>blackberry</b> <b>jams</b> with concentrate and pulp of Jerusalem artichoke. The products developed were then subject to chemical, microbiological and sensorial analyses, upon production and again after one month of storage, in order to confirm the conservation ability of the products. The results obtained allowed concluding that the juices, nectars and jams produced could be considered as functional foods, since they contained a high content of inulin, a prebiotic compound, and {{also because of the}} low fructose content...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{objective}} of this project {{was to investigate the}} effects of refrigeration storage and processing technologies on the quality and nutraceutical benefit of blackberries. 'Marion' and 'Evergreen', the two major blackberry varieties in Oregon, were evaluated in this study. For refrigeration storage, fresh fruit were packed in clam-shell containers right after harvest and stored at 2. 0 ± 0. 2 °C and 95 ± 2 % relative humidity for 9 or 7 days for 'Marion' and 'Evergreen', respectively. For evaluating processing effect, fresh fruit were individually quick frozen at - 23 °C and then subjected to different processing treatments including freeze drying, hot-air drying, canning-in-water, canning-in- 20 ° Brix sucrose syrup, and making into jam. Processed berry products were stored at room temperature at 25 ± 2 °C and 30 ± 2 % relative humidity for up to 6 months. Physicochemical properties including pH, titratable acidity (TA), total soluble solids (TSS) and moisture content (MC), bioactive compounds including total phenolics (TPC) and total monomeric anthocyanins (ACY), and antioxidant capacities evaluated as radical scavenging activity (RSA), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) were monitored in fresh blackberries and processed blackberry products right after processing and during storage. Frozen fruit were used as a control for evaluating processing effects. TA reduced by 36. 8 % and 46. 2 % in 'Marion' and 'Evergreen', respectively (P< 0. 05) at the end of refrigeration storage compared to that at day 0. TPC and ACY decreased significantly in both varieties. ORAC declined by 20 % and FRAP increased by 18. 75 %, respectively in 'Evergreen' (P< 0. 05) while remained stable in 'Marion' during refrigeration storage. Right after processing, TA in all the processed 'Marion' products lost significantly, while TSS increased in dried <b>blackberries</b> and <b>blackberry</b> <b>jams</b> of both varieties. Freeze drying increased TPC by 27 % and 21 % in 'Marion' and 'Evergreen', respectively (P< 0. 05), whereas hot-air drying reduced ACY by 56 % in 'Marion' and 84 % in 'Evergreen' (P< 0. 05). The content of measured bioactive compounds lost 31 % to 70 % (P< 0. 05) in canned products except TPC in 'Marion' canned-in-water. ORAC and FRAP lost 21 %- 61 % in canned 'Marion' (P< 0. 05). RSA increased in canning-in-water fruit while decreased in canning-in-sucrose syrup for both varieties. Making <b>blackberries</b> to <b>jams</b> resulted in extensive losses of bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity in both varieties. Over 6 –month storage, TA deceased 9 % and 12 % in 'Marion' and 'Evergreen' jams, respectively (P< 0. 05). The significant losses of ACY in hot-air dried, canned <b>blackberries</b> and <b>blackberry</b> <b>jams,</b> and RSA in frozen, dried and canned blackberries, ORAC in hot-air dried and canned-in-water blackberries of both varieties were also observed. Two varieties of blackberries varied in physicochemical properties, content of bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacities, with higher values of TA, MC, TPC, ACY, RSA and FRAP observed in 'Marion' than those in 'Evergreen'...|$|R

40|$|Brazil is {{the third}} largest {{producer}} of fresh fruits in the world. Among fruits, berries such as strawberry, blueberry and blackberry can be highlighted for the benefits they provide to the body, owing to their presence of bioactive compound content. The phenolic compounds, especially anthocyanins and ascorbic acid, are examples of bioactive compounds that mainly function in the body as antioxidants. However, the processing steps {{that lead to the}} generation of derivatives from these fruits, are damaging to these compounds, often leading to their loss. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} physically and chemically characterize fresh berries (strawberry, blueberry and <b>blackberry)</b> and their <b>jams,</b> and also to quantify and to evaluate the antioxidant activity of bioactive compounds in berries and their jams. The following parameters were analyzed: moisture, ash, pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids, and color. The levels of total phenolic compounds, total anthocyanins, ascorbic acid content and antioxidant activity were measured. We concluded that there were significant differences in the chemical composition of berries and jams. There was also a significant loss of bioactive compounds due to processing, nevertheless these jams remain good sources of bioactive compounds, and are still considered important to promote some favorable health effects...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the National Blackberry Collection around Deal in the Kent Messenger (07 / 09 / 1918), the simple collective act of picking blackberries reveals the resilience of Home Front communities during World War One inside and around the town’s built landscape. As the war continued, local landmarks such as the Town Hall transformed to co-exist with the various needs of a community living with war becoming first aid stations and hospitals whilst school children were tasked to pick <b>blackberries</b> to make <b>jam</b> for the trenches. Artist Colin Priest is working with Deal Town Council to create a new piece of work for Deal Town Hall assembling found narratives about the town and the National Blackberry Collection through film, found artifacts, photography, an open call for recipes and performance enlivening the significant built heritage of the area and vitality of the skyward perspective in recovery. The work titled Blackberry Tonic is part of Codename: Joined Up, a project connecting contemporary artists with museums and heritage sites through WW 1 -related history and managed by Dover Arts Development. The Blackberry Tonic Scratch Performance, a work-in-progress event took place in the Town Hall on Friday 30 th October 2015 at 7 pm. Silent films made in and around the Town Hall, featuring living historians Andrew and Muriel Morgan and some readings from A Nurse at the Front: The First World War Diaries of Sister Edith Appleton by the artist, piano accompanied the evening with a selection of early 20 th century piano pieces from composers such as Arthur De Greef, Federico Mompou and Melanie Helene Bonis...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} furthers {{the assessment}} of consumer demand for locally produced foods, while also considering {{a host of other}} food attributes that may interact to influence consumer utility. Using stated preference data from a choice-based conjoint analysis survey instrument, we estimate willingness-to-pay for processed food products (<b>blackberry</b> <b>jam)</b> that are differentiated with respect to their branding, the location of their production, certification as organically produced, branding as a product of a small family farming association, and carrying a State Proud certification. Although price is the most important single attribute influencing consumer choice for our sample, consumers also were willing to pay more for food products produced in their state or in a well identified multistate region. Our sample was more willing to purchase organic products, although there was an indication of some confusion as to the meaning of the NOP organic logo. Our results also supported the notion that consumers are willing to support small family farms with purchases if the product is clearly labeled as a product of small farms. These conclusions have important is significant has important policy and merchandising strategy implications.
