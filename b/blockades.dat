Robert Blake commanded the town's Parliamentarian defences during all three sieges, from September 1644 to July 1645.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blockade</b> {{running is}} the {{practice}} of delivering cargo (food, for example) to a <b>blockaded</b> area. It has mainly been done by ships (called <b>blockade</b> runners) across ports under naval <b>blockade.</b> <b>Blockade</b> runners were typically the fastest ships available and often lightly armed and armored.|$|R
50|$|A <b>blockade</b> runner {{is usually}} a lighter-weight ship used for evading a naval <b>blockade</b> of a port or strait, as opposed to confronting the blockaders to break the <b>blockade.</b> Very often <b>blockade</b> running is done in order to {{transport}} cargo, for example to bring food or arms to a <b>blockaded</b> city. In other cases the <b>blockade</b> runners would carry mail {{in an attempt to}} communicate with the outside world.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>blockade</b> {{is formed}} when {{two pieces of}} a single player occupy the same space.

Another player's piece cannot land in a space occupied by a <b>blockade,</b> even to leave its nest. Local rules may {{limit the number of}} turns that a <b>blockade</b> can stay in place.|$|R
5|$|During the Pittston strike, the UMWA {{wanted to}} only use nonviolent means of {{protest against the}} company. Many union members practiced this method of civil disobedience and found {{creative}} ways for their message to be heard such as mass sit down strike and road <b>blockades.</b> However, many wildcat strikers ignored {{the request of the}} UMWA and used violence to express the anger that they felt toward the Pittston Coal Company. By the time the strike had ended, over 4,000people had been arrested for their actions.|$|E
5|$|During {{the wars}} against Napoleonic France, Gibraltar served {{first as a}} Royal Navy base from which <b>blockades</b> of the ports of Cádiz, Cartagena and Toulon were mounted, then as a gateway for British forces and {{supplies}} in the Peninsular War between 1807 and 1814. In July 1801 a French and Spanish naval force fought the two Battles of Algeciras off Gibraltar, which ended in disaster for the Spanish when two of their largest warships each mistook the other for the enemy, engaged each other, collided, caught fire and exploded, killing nearly 2,000 Spanish sailors. Two years later Gibraltar served {{as a base for}} Lord Nelson in his efforts to bring the French Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve to battle, which culminated in the Battle of Trafalgar in which Nelson was killed and Villeneuve captured. Nelson sailed to Gibraltar in June 1803 to launch the Trafalgar Campaign and oversee the <b>blockades</b> against France and Spain, though he spent little time ashore. On 28 October 1805, a week after the Battle of Trafalgar, the badly damaged HMS Victory returned to Gibraltar with Nelson's body aboard; Admiral Collingwood's dispatch to General Fox, announcing the victory and Nelson's death, was printed {{in the pages of the}} Gibraltar Chronicle. It thus became the first newspaper in the world to report the victory at Trafalgar, two weeks ahead of The Times.|$|E
5|$|In the 17thcentury, Aarhus {{entered a}} period of {{recession}} as it suffered <b>blockades</b> and bombardments during the Swedish wars and trade was dampened by the preferential treatment of the capital by the state. It {{was not until the}} middle of the 18thcentury growth returned in large part due to trade with the large agricultural catchment areas around the city; particularly grain proved to be a remunerative export. The first factories were established at this time as the industrial revolution reached the country and in 1810 the harbour was expanded to accommodate growing trade.|$|E
50|$|Early {{battles in}} support of the <b>blockade</b> {{included}} the <b>Blockade</b> of the Chesapeake Bay, from May to June 1861, and the <b>Blockade</b> of the Carolina Coast, August-December 1861. Both enabled the Union Navy to gradually extend its <b>blockade</b> southward along the Atlantic seaboard.|$|R
50|$|A loose <b>blockade</b> {{is a close}} <b>blockade</b> {{where the}} <b>blockading</b> ships are {{withdrawn}} out of sight from the coast (behind the horizon) but no farther. The object of loose <b>blockade</b> is to lure the enemy into venturing out but to stay close enough to strike.|$|R
25|$|During {{the course}} of the Civil War, most of the {{attempts}} to run the <b>blockade</b> succeeded, but as the months passed, the captains and crews on <b>blockade</b> patrol became more seasoned and grew wiser to the various tactics employed by <b>blockade</b> runners.

5|$|Massachusetts {{served in}} the Spanish–American War (1898) {{as part of the}} Flying Squadron and took part in the <b>blockades</b> of Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba. She missed the decisive Battle of Santiago de Cuba after {{steaming}} to Guantánamo Bay the night before to resupply coal. After the war she served with the North Atlantic Squadron, performing training maneuvers and gunnery practice. During this period she suffered an explosion in an 8-inch gun turret, killing nine, and ran aground twice, requiring several months of repair both times. She was decommissioned in 1906 for modernization.|$|E
5|$|A {{tower was}} {{built out of}} {{the remains of the}} roof, similar to one that had existed at Claremont Road, and a system of defences and <b>blockades</b> were built. A core of around 30 protesters ensured that there were always people staying there (a legal {{requirement}} for a squatted home, as well as a defence against eviction). They were finally evicted on 21 June 1995, whereupon, as at Claremont Road, the building was immediately demolished. The total cost of removing the protesters from Munstonia was given to be £239,349.52, not including additional costs of security guards.|$|E
5|$|Bayern {{participated in}} the {{ceremonial}} transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control {{in the summer of}} 1890. She was present during the fleet maneuvers in September, where the entire eight-ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel. She remained with the I Division in 1891; the year's maneuvers simulated a two-front war against Russia and either France of Denmark. Bayern {{participated in the}} 1892 fleet maneuvers as well. Three separate simulations were conducted, which included French <b>blockades</b> of the German North Sea coast and a Russian attack on Kiel. Vice Admiral Wilhelm Schröder commanded the fleet maneuvers of 1893, which simulated a protracted campaign against a superior French fleet. Bayern and her three sisters served as the Russian Baltic Fleet during the 1894 maneuvers.|$|E

40|$|Rats were {{injected}} intravenously {{with various}} particulate materials {{with and without}} the addition of various stabilizing agents. One hour after the injection of the <b>blockading</b> colloid, a tracer dose of similar or different colloidal material was injected. A half-time clearance rate of the tracer dose greater than 4 minutes was taken as evidence of <b>blockade</b> of the RES. <b>Blockade</b> of the tracer dose occurred when the surface properties of the particles in both <b>blockading</b> and tracer doses were identical. Different particles stabilized by the same agent behaved as identical particles and identical particles stabilized by different agents behaved as different particles. The opsonization of a tracer dose of gelatin-stabilized colloid in vitro by a specific globulin fraction obtained from heterologous and homologous plasma prevented its <b>blockade,</b> while opsonization of both <b>blockading</b> and tracer doses with the same proteins resulted in <b>blockade.</b> However, when both <b>blockading</b> and tracer doses were opsonized with isologous globulins, <b>blockade</b> did not occur...|$|R
5|$|Despite ineffectual {{long-range}} gunfire {{towards the}} British ship by {{the remainder of}} the Spanish squadron, the isolated Santa Dorotea was rapidly forced to surrender, O'Neil eventually turning the other three frigates back towards Cartagena. Unopposed, Dixon was able to consolidate his prize and send it to St Vincent's fleet off Cadiz, where it was subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy. Lion remained in the Mediterranean during the year, later participating in the <b>blockades</b> of Malta and Alexandria. The Spanish, their seaports carefully guarded by Royal Navy squadrons, launched no further expeditions into the Mediterranean during the year.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, Kirchner {{introduced}} a new sliding-scale taxation system for agricultural exports, so that rates fluctuated with international prices. This would effectively raise levies on soybean exports from 35% to 44% {{at the time of}} the announcement. This new taxation scheme, proposed by Minister Martín Lousteau, led to a nationwide lockout by farming associations, with the aim of forcing the government to back down on new tax system. They were joined on 25 March by thousands of pot-banging demonstrators massed around the Buenos Aires Obelisk and the presidential palace. These demonstrations were followed by others at locations across the country that included road <b>blockades</b> and food shortages.|$|E
5|$|Neptune {{was built}} {{during the early}} years of the war with Revolutionary France and was {{launched}} in 1797. She almost immediately became caught up in the events of the mutiny at the Nore, and was one of a few loyal ships tasked with attacking mutinous vessels if they could not be brought to order. The mutiny died out before this became necessary and Neptune joined the Channel Fleet. She moved to the Mediterranean in 1799, spending the rest of the French Revolutionary Wars in operations with Vice-Admiral Lord Keith's fleet. After refitting, and spending time on <b>blockades,</b> she formed part of Lord Nelson's fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar, and was heavily involved in the fighting, sustaining casualties of 10 killed and 34 wounded.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of "reticuloendothelial blockade" were studied in living rabbits and isolated, perfused rabbit livers utilizing gelatin as a <b>blockading</b> agent and Au 198 stabilized in gelatin as a tracer. Employing the above experimental model, the following observations were made. (a) RES <b>blockade</b> was specific and {{dependent on the}} surface properties of the particle under study. (b) RES <b>blockade</b> was not caused by saturation of hepatic removal mechanisms. (c) RES <b>blockade</b> was not caused by depletion of demonstrable serum opsonins. (d) RES <b>blockade</b> appeared to correlate with high circulating levels of the <b>blockading</b> agent, per se. Thus, under the conditions employed, the term "reticuloendothelial blockade" was a misnomer. Although specificity of liver macrophage-particle interaction was evident and deserves further study, the data suggest that <b>blockade</b> as usually studied is a laboratory phenomenon induced by the continuing circulation of the <b>blockading</b> agent...|$|R
5|$|Prime Minister Franjo Gregurić advised Tuđman to {{implement}} Špegelj's plan. According to General Anton Tus, Tuđman ordered the ZNG to capture JNA barracks on 12 September, but rescinded the order the next day.

The same day, the ZNG and the Croatian police blockaded and cut utilities to all JNA facilities it had access to, beginning the Battle of the Barracks. This action comprised <b>blockades</b> of 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia, and numerous smaller facilities, including border posts, and weapons and ammunition storage depots.|$|E

The charges included allegations that the offensive against Dubrovnik aimed to detach the area from Croatia and annex it to Serbia or Montenegro. Jokić said that the offensive only aimed to blockade Dubrovnik, but that claim was later refuted by Cokić. Mihailo Crnobrnja, a former Yugoslav ambassador to the European Union, speculated that the siege was intended to force an end to <b>blockades</b> of JNA barracks in Croatia and to claim the Prevlaka Peninsula for Montenego.|$|E
5|$|Since the Turtle’s {{emergence}} {{over two}} centuries ago, the international playing field has leveled. The monopoly over submersible technology once {{held by the}} United States was lost over time as other navies around the world modernized and adopted submarine warfare. From the innovations of John Holland {{in the early twentieth}} century to the German U-boat campaigns of the World Wars, and the nuclear-powered ICBM submarines of the Cold War, modern navies embraced the submarine, first, for missions of reconnaissance and commerce-raiding, but, increasingly, in offensive, attack roles. In the postwar era, the submarine has become a central component of modern navies. Submarine usage has gone far beyond Bushnell’s conception of lifting naval <b>blockades</b> designed to bleed a country dry of their imports to become an essential arm of offensive naval warfare and power projection.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Femoral nerve <b>blockade</b> {{combined}} with sciatic nerve <b>blockade</b> {{has been reported}} to be an effective treatment regimen for postoperative analgesia following lower extremity surgery. Saphenous nerve <b>blockade</b> is an alternative to femoral nerve <b>blockade</b> for postoperative analgesia in knee arthroplasty surgeryand the level and quality of analgesia that either technique provides patients have been reported to be equivalent. This study compared the postoperative analgesic properties of combined femoral and sciatic nerve <b>blockade</b> with those of combined saphenous and sciatic nerve <b>blockade</b> in patients that underwent foot and ankle surgery. Method: All patients received general inhalational endotracheal anesthesia and were administered lateral popliteal sciatic nerve <b>blockade</b> by a combined nerve stimulator and ultrasound guidance technique in the postoperative recovery area. During {{the first six months of}} the study femoral nerve <b>blockade</b> was simultaneously administered employing combined nerve stimulation and ultrasound guidance. During the second six month interval saphenous nerve <b>blockade</b> was administered using ultrasound guidance. Continuous nerve block catheters were inserted if patients were admitted over 24 hours. Breakthrough pain was treated with hydro-morphone patient controlled analgesic infusions. Postoperative pain scores, opioid analgesic consumption and lower extremity movement in the immediate recovery period and at 24 hours after nerve <b>blockade</b> were recorded. Results: 167 patients were enrolled. Femoral nerve <b>blockade</b> was administered to 45 patients and 122 received a saphenous nerve <b>blockade.</b> Immediate pain scores were lower for opioid naïve females that were administered saphenous nerve <b>blockade.</b> All groups that received saphenous nerve <b>blockade</b> had lower opioid requirements in the immediate postoperative period. Differences in pain scores and opioid requirements were noted between opioid naïve and tolerant patient groups. Conclusion: Combined popliteal sciatic and saphenous nerve <b>blockade</b> resulted in lower immediate postoperative pain scores in opioid naïve females and reduced immediate postoperative rescue opioid analgesic dosages in all patient groups. Differences in pain scores and analgesic requirements were not present 24 hours postoperatively. Opioid tolerant patients with effective nerve <b>blockade</b> 24 hours postoperatively required elevated rescue opioid analgesic medication dosages...|$|R

5|$|The clash at the Plitvice Lakes worsened {{the overall}} {{situation}} in Croatia {{and led to}} an escalation of the conflict. Even though the Croatian and Serb forces were separated by the JNA at the Plitvice Lakes, {{the situation in the}} area continued to deteriorate following the clash. In nearby Plaški, Croatian police personnel left the local police station and were replaced by Serb officers. Both SAO Krajina and Croatian forces set up several roadblocks on the Saborsko–Lička Jasenica–Ogulin road. By summer, the <b>blockades</b> were extended to the north of Plaški and south of Saborsko, where Croatian authorities established another 30-strong police station on 2 April. Only JNA vehicles were permitted to pass the roadblocks, and that brought about a shortage of food, medicine and electricity in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Aarhus {{began as a}} {{fortified}} Viking settlement founded in the 8th century and with the first written records stemming from the bishopric seated here from at least 948. The city was founded on the northern shores of a fjord at a natural harbour and the primary driver of growth was for centuries seaborne trade in agricultural products. Market town privileges were granted in 1441, but growth stagnated in the 17thcentury as the city suffered <b>blockades</b> and bombardments during the Swedish Wars. In the 19th century it was occupied twice by German troops during the Schleswig Wars but avoided destruction. As the industrial revolution took hold, the city grew to become the second-largest in the country by the 20th century.|$|E
