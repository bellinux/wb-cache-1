40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the implementation of}} correlation filter for <b>lower</b> <b>face</b> verification with different expression of images for each speaker. The motivation to implementing <b>lower</b> <b>face</b> images instead of face images is because the mouth is subject to fundamental changes during speech. Furthermore, the smaller size of a <b>lower</b> <b>face</b> image compared that of a face can reduce storage capacity and increase the speed of computation. The performance of <b>lower</b> <b>face</b> verification using Minimum Average Correlation Energy (MACE) filter is evaluated. The results are promising and offer good potential for <b>lower</b> <b>face</b> verification compare with face verification performance...|$|R
