5000|$|Some of the <b>Beaufort's</b> {{actions were}} attacks on {{warships}} of the German Kriegsmarine. The first attack was on 21 June 1940, when nine <b>Beauforts</b> of 42 Squadron attacked the [...] off the Norwegian coast. No torpedoes were available at RAF Wick and a dive bombing attack {{was carried out}} using two 500 lb bombs. The <b>Beauforts</b> encountered Messerschmitt Bf 109s protecting the battleship and only four returned; shortly after, <b>Beauforts</b> were grounded for modifications to their Taurus engines.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Beauforts</b> and Hudsons flew {{towards the}} Dutch coast and lost touch {{in the cloud}} and rain but the Hudsons made ASV contact and {{attacked}} the ships, two being shot down for no result.

5|$|Coastal Command {{had agreed}} to provide three {{squadron}}s of Bristol <b>Beaufort</b> torpedo bombers. The Fleet Air Arm (FAA) contributed one squadron of Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers. RAF Bomber Command had some 300 bombers on standby for any operation. There were problems, however. The Swordfish were very slow, and fighter escort of the aircraft was difficult. The <b>Beaufort</b> squadrons were all spread out and {{it was difficult to}} bring them together. One squadron was based at Leuchers, Scotland, one at Thorney Island, Portsmouth, England, and one near St Eval, Cornwall, England.|$|E

2500|$|Whirlwind fighter-bombers {{tried to}} engage the fleet around [...] but were intercepted by the fighter screen. The seven <b>Beauforts</b> at Thorney Island were closest to the Brest Group when it was sighted. Two <b>Beauforts</b> had been bombed up and one went unserviceable, before the other four took off at [...] The four <b>Beauforts</b> were late to meet their fighter escorts at Manston and the torpedo-bombers and fighters were ordered {{independently}} to the German ships. The position, course and speed of the Brest Group was given by voice (R/T) to the Spitfires and Morse (W/T) to the <b>Beauforts.</b> The torpedo-bombers failed to receive the orders, because 16 Group forgot {{that they had been}} fitted with R/T for Operation Fuller. When the <b>Beauforts</b> reached Manston they circled with numerous fighters which appeared to ignore them. Two <b>Beauforts</b> flew to the French coast, found nothing and landed at Manston where the confusion was resolved. The other two aircraft had already landed at Manston, where the crews found {{out what was going on}} and set off for the Belgian coast, arriving at [...] (when the Nore Command destroyers were attacking). Both bombers flew through the German flak and attacked Prinz Eugen, dropping their torpedoes at , to no effect.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Beaufort</b> was {{too fast}} for the torpedoes available, so new tactics had to be {{developed}} and the aircraft was restricted to mine-laying or bombing missions. It was soon grounded for other reasons. After No. 22 Squadron carried out more trials, it began operations on 31 August 1940. On 11 September a torpedo attack succeeded in hitting a 6,000 ton freighter. On 17 September No. 22, 53 and 57 Squadron sank a 1,600 ton freighter in Cherbourg harbour. An E-boat was also destroyed and oil tanks were also set ablaze and burned uncontrollably for several days. The cost was a single <b>Beaufort.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{failure of}} Coastal Command to acquire any {{tangible}} results prompted the Admiralty to complain to the Air Ministry on 5 November 1940. In December {{it was agreed}} that 15 of the planned new 100 RAF squadrons be given to Coastal Command. These were to be operational by 1941. In the interim, four aircraft were to be given to each of the squadrons to bolster their strength, while a further <b>Beaufort</b> fighter and <b>Beaufort</b> torpedo bomber squadron were also made available.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beaufort</b> {{developed}} the Wind Force Scale and Weather Notation coding, {{which he was}} to use in his journals {{for the remainder of}} his life. He also promoted the development of reliable tide tables around British shores, and with his friend William Whewell, expanded weather record-keeping at 200 British Coast guard stations.|$|E
5|$|By 17 June, Allied planes began {{operating}} from Labuan airfield and the 2/43rd Battalion was transferred across Brunei Bay to the mainland, landing at Menumbok and Mempakul, after an amphibious reconnaissance, {{along with the}} 2/11th Commando Squadron. Two companies and the battalion headquarters landed at Mempakul on 19 June, and the 2/43rd subsequently advanced up the Klias River, using barges and landing craft, while the 2/32nd Battalion advanced along the Padas River. By late June, the two battalions converged on <b>Beaufort,</b> linking up {{to the west of}} Kandu, and between 26 and 29 June 1945, the town was the scene of heavy fighting during which the 2/43rd lost 13 men killed and 30 wounded. The 2/43rd was tasked with taking the high ground {{to the north of the}} town around the Woodford Estate and Mount Lawley, and carrying out a flanking attack to the east. For his actions in destroying four Japanese machine-gun positions, Private Tom Starcevich was awarded the Victoria Cross. After the capture of <b>Beaufort,</b> the fighting continued in the area as the 2/28th Battalion kept up the pressure on the withdrawing Japanese; for the 2/43rd, though, <b>Beaufort</b> proved to be the last significant action of the war, as hostilities ended in mid-August, following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The battalion's final campaign of the war cost it 56 casualties, including those killed or wounded on Labuan.|$|E

5|$|Richard's {{succession}} to the estates {{did not go}} undisputed, however.

5|$|The Kingston Lacy estate {{originally}} formed {{part of a}} royal estate {{within the}} manor of Wimborne. The original house stood {{to the north of}} the current house. It was built in the medieval period and was used as a hunting lodge in connection with the deer park to its northwest. Leased to those who found favour with the monarch, lessees included the de Lacys, Earls of Lincoln, who held it in addition to estates at Shapwick and Blandford Forum. In the 15th century the property was leased to John <b>Beaufort,</b> Duke of Somerset, whose daughter Lady Margaret <b>Beaufort,</b> mother of King Henry VII, was brought up at Kingston Lacy.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{was widely}} {{dispersed}} following its {{arrival in the}} Brunei Bay area. In June 1945, the brigade headquarters and the 366th and 367th Independent Infantry Battalions were stationed in Brunei. The 368th Independent Infantry Battalion was located at the inland town of <b>Beaufort,</b> and the 371st Independent Infantry Battalion formed {{the main body of}} the island of Labuan's garrison. Of the support units, the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade Artillery Unit was at Brunei and the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade Engineer and Signal Units were at <b>Beaufort.</b> All of the brigade's heavy weapons had been left behind at Tawau, and due to the casualties incurred during the march across Borneo its combat units were not fit for battle.|$|E
