5|$|Created by the god Brahma as {{the most}} <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman,</b> Ahalya was married to the much older Gautama. In the {{earliest}} full narrative, when Indra comes disguised as her husband, Ahalya sees through his disguise but nevertheless accepts his advances. Later sources often absolve her of all guilt, describing how she falls prey to Indra's trickery. In all narratives, Ahalya and Indra are cursed by Gautama. The curse varies from text to text, but almost all versions describe Rama as the eventual agent of her liberation and redemption. Although early texts describe how Ahalya must atone by undergoing severe penance while remaining invisible {{to the world and}} how she is purified by offering Rama hospitality, in the popular retelling developed over time, Ahalya is cursed to become a stone and regains her human form after she is brushed by Rama's foot.|$|E

5|$|Legends {{of female}} vampire-like beings who can detach {{parts of their}} upper body occur in the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia.

The manananggal is described as being an older, <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman</b> capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge bat-like wings and prey on unsuspecting, sleeping pregnant women in their homes.
