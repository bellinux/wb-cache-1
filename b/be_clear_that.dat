If, after it certifies the test results, the City faces a disparate-impact suit, then {{in light of}} our holding today it should <b>be</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the City would avoid disparate-impact liability based on the strong basis in evidence that, had it not certified the results, {{it would have been}} subject to disparate-treatment liability.|$|E
25|$|It should <b>be</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{the quantum}} {{mechanical}} {{formulation of the}} Franck–Condon principle {{is the result of}} a series of approximations, principally the electrical dipole transition assumption and the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. Weaker magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole electronic transitions along with the incomplete validity of the factorization of the total wavefunction into nuclear, electronic spatial and spin wavefunctions means that the selection rules, including the Franck-Condon factor, are not strictly observed. For any given transition, the value of P is determined by all of the selection rules, however spin selection is the largest contributor, followed by electronic selection rules. The Franck-Condon factor only weakly modulates the intensity of transitions, i.e., it contributes with a factor on the order of 1 to the intensity of bands whose order of magnitude is determined by the other selection rules. The table below gives the range of extinction coefficients for the possible combinations of allowed and forbidden spin and orbital selection rules.|$|E

Sofaer wrote, [...] "It is a beautiful book: large, with print size that is easy on the eyes, and with sufficient space between lines of text to make the complex material at least visually digestible. It has useful tables of cases, instruments, legislation, and abbreviations, {{as well as an}} index." [...] He commented, [...] "it should <b>be</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> a reader seeking a single, nonredundant and objective account of targeted killing should find another book. On the other hand, this collection of essays provides several original and useful treatments of various aspects of the subject." [...] Sofaer said that the book could have given more weight to the law enforcement model of how and when to use deadly force against individuals.|$|E

Before his death, the storyboard and script, even part of the keyframe film was already completed. Then I thought, even if someone can mimic Kon's work, it would still <b>be</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> it's only an imitation. For example, if Mamoru Hosoda took the director's position, the completed Dreaming Machine {{would still be a}} good piece of work. However, that would make it Hosoda's movie, not Kon's. Dreaming Machine should be Kon's movie, him and only him, not someone else's. That means we cannot and should not [...] "compromise" [...] only to finish it. I spent years to finally reach this hard conclusion. Instead, we should take only Kon's [...] "original concept", and let somebody turn it into a feature film. By doing so, the completed piece could 100% be that person's work, and I'm OK with that. I also considered about doing a documentary of Kon." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{an express}} trust to be valid, the trust {{instrument}} must show certainty of intention, {{subject matter and}} object. Certainty of intention means that it must <b>be</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the settlor or testator wishes to create a trust; this is not dependent on any particular language used, and a trust can be created without the word [...] "trust" [...] being used, or even the settlor knowing he is creating a trust. Since the 1950s, the courts have been more willing to conclude that there was intention to create a trust, rather than hold that the trust is void. Certainty of subject matter means {{that it must be}} clear what property is part of the trust. Historically the property must have been segregated from non-trust property; more recently, the courts have drawn a line between tangible and intangible assets, holding that with intangible assets there is not always a need for segregation. Certainty of objects means that it must be clear who the beneficiaries, or objects, are. The test for determining this differs {{depending on the type of}} trust; it can be that all beneficiaries must be individually identified, or that the trustees must be able to say with certainty, if a claimant comes before them, whether he is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of , a remake of [...] for the Nintendo 3DS, {{director}} Eiji Aonuma suggested that a Majora's Mask remake was [...] "not an impossibility", depending on interest and demand. Following this news, a fan campaign called [...] "Operation Moonfall" [...] was launched to promote the remake of Majora's Mask on the 3DS. The campaign name is {{a reference to a}} similar fan-based movement, Operation Rainfall, set up to persuade Nintendo of America to release a trio of role-playing video games for the Wii. The petition reached 10,000 signatures within five days. In response to the feedback, Nintendo of America released a statement: [...] "At the risk of dampening the excitement you feel, I must <b>be</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> no official announcements have been made regarding a remake of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask for the Nintendo 3DS. However, we like hearing what our consumers find important." [...] In an interview with GamesRadar in November 2011, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma acknowledged Operation Moonfall and told fans that he hopes to respond to their request sometime in the future. At E3 2012, Miyamoto stated that a 3D remake was still under consideration. Once again, shortly after E3 2013, Miyamoto commented that the fans supporting a Majora's Mask 3D remake were [...] "still in his memory".|$|E

2500|$|On February 28, 1935, Furtwängler met Goebbels, {{who wanted}} to keep Furtwängler in Germany, since he {{considered}} him, like Richard Strauss and Hans Pfitzner, a [...] "national treasure".

Furtwängler accepted: Hitler was a dictator and controlled everything in the country.

2500|$|According to {{yet another}} mafia justice collaborator, Antonino Giuffrè – [...] arrested on 16 April 2002 – the Mafia turned to Berlusconi's Forza Italia party {{to look after the}} Mafia's {{interests}}, after the decline in the early 1990s of the ruling Christian Democrat party (DC – Democrazia Cristiana) – whose leaders in Sicily looked after the Mafia's interests in Rome. The Mafia's fall out with the Christian Democrats became clear when the DC strong man in Sicily, Salvo Lima, was killed in March 1992. [...] "The Lima murder marked the end of an era," [...] Giuffrè told the court. [...] "A new era opened with a new political force on the horizon which provided the guarantees that the Christian Democrats were no longer able to deliver. To <b>be</b> <b>clear,</b> <b>that</b> party was Forza Italia."
