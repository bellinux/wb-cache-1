5000|$|The <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> {{is usually}} found in river mouths, {{brackish}} lagoons, and coastal waters, but may penetrate far upstream. Most populations are anadromous, migrating {{as far as}} 2100 km inland to spawn during the late summer. In most of its range, the <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> is abundant. Its habitats are mostly remote and pristine, and it has no known threats. In rivers, {{it may be the}} most abundant migratory fish. In estuaries, the <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> is an important [...] "keystone species", serving as an important source of food for larger animals. The <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> is taken commercially, and sold as [...] "white trout". In New York, smoked Bering ciscoes are popular, and are esteemed for their creamy flesh. They are sold instead of the usual holiday food of Great Lakes whitefishes. Subsistence fishermen also take the <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> in small numbers, as do commercial fishermen fishing for salmon during its migration.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> {{feeds on}} amphipods and other {{invertebrates}} and small fish such as sculpins. It migrates to clear and shallow streams {{in the late}} summer, not feeding during migration. Not eating during migration is typical among salmon, but rare in whitefishes. Spawning occurs in clear, cool streams with 1 to 3 inch gravel. A year after hatching, young ciscoes drift downstream to estuaries. The <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> becomes sexually mature when it is four to nine years old.|$|E
50|$|Most Coregonus species inhabit {{lakes and}} rivers, and several species, {{including}} the Arctic cisco (C. autumnalis), the <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> (C. laurettae), {{and the least}} cisco (C. sardinella) are anadromous, moving between salt water and fresh water.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> or Lauretta {{whitefish}} (Coregonus laurettae) is a freshwater whitefish {{found in}} Alaska {{and part of}} Russia. It is often {{considered to be the}} same species as the more common Arctic cisco (Coregonus autumnalis).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> has an elongate, {{compressed}} body. It is silvery-coloured, with a brownish or greenish back. Its pelvic and pectoral fins {{are almost}} clear, and its other fins are spotted white. It is {{distinguished from the}} Arctic cisco by its smaller number of gill rakers. It reaches a maximum length of 48 cm.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> {{is found}} in Alaska from Cook Inlet on the south coast to Oliktok Point on the Arctic coast. It occurs on the Yukon River as far {{upstream}} as Dawson City, on the Porcupine River, and in the lakes of the Brooks Range. There are some reports of Bering ciscoes from the Chukchi Peninsula and the Kamchatka Peninsula, these presumably being migrants from Alaska.|$|E
50|$|Fishery {{and hunting}} have {{relatively}} small volume and are mostly {{concentrated in the}} river deltas. Data are available for the Khatanga Bay and deltas of the Lena and Yana rivers from 1981 to 1991 which translate into about 3,000 tonnes of fish annually. Extrapolated, they give the following annual estimates (in thousand tonnes) by species: sardine (1.2), Arctic cisco (2.0), <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> (2.7), broad whitefish (2.6), Muksun (2.4) and others (3.6). Hunting sea mammals is only practiced by native people. In particular, walrus hunting is only allowed by scientific expeditions and local tribes for subsistence.|$|E
50|$|The sea is used {{mostly for}} {{transportation}} of goods across the northern coast of Russia during August-September. The navigation is hindered even in summer by the remaining floating ice which is also brought down to the southern shores by occasional winds. Fishery and hunting of marine animals is still practised as traditional activities, but has only local importance. Fishery mostly targets salmon, halibut and crab. Data exist on fish production, which in 2005 was distributed, in thousand tonnes as follows: sardine (1.6), Arctic cisco (1.8), <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> (2.2), broad whitefish (2.7), Muksun (2.8) and others (3.6).|$|E
50|$|Permanent mammal species include {{ringed seal}} (Phoca hispida), bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus), walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), {{collared}} lemming (Dicrostonyx torquatus), Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) wolf (Canis lupus), ermine (Mustela erminea), Arctic hare (Lepus timidus) and polar bear (Ursus maritimus), whereas beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) visit the region seasonally. The walrus of the Laptev Sea is sometimes distinguished {{as a separate}} subspecies Odobenus rosmarus laptevi, though this attribution is questioned. There are several dozens species of birds. Some belong to permanent (tundra) species, such as snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis), purple sandpiper (Calidris maritima), snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) and brent goose and other make large colonies on the islands and sea shores. The latter include little auk (Alle alle), black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), black guillemot (Cepphus grylle), ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea), uria, charadriiformes and glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus). Amont other bird species are skua, sterna, northern fulmar, (Fulmarus glacialis), ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea), glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus), Ross's gull (Rhodostethia rosea), long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis), eider, loon and willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus). There are 39 fish species, mostly typical of braskish environment; the major ones are grayling and Coregonus (whitefishes), such as muksun (Coregonus muksun), broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus) and omul (Coregonus autumnalis). Also common are sardine, Arctic cisco, <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco,</b> polar smelt, saffron cod, polar cod, flounder and Arctic char and inconnu.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 Methods {{for stock}} {{discrimination}} and tracking the movements {{and distribution of}} fishes have often involved expensive field logistics, a problem compounded in remote regions such as Alaska. An alternative approach {{is to use the}} chemical signatures preserved in otoliths, or ear bones, of teleost fishes to discriminate stocks or to track the movement history of fish. Currently, a commercial fishery targeting the anadromous <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> Coregonus laurettae is occurring in the Yukon River, Alaska. There are only three known <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> spawning rivers worldwide, the Yukon, South Fork Kuskokwim (Kuskokwim), and Susitna rivers. Managers and researchers believed that two of the three spawning-river populations (Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers) were being harvested in the fishery, due to major coastal currents linking two of the spawning rivers' deltas. To determine the likelihood of a mixed-stock fishery, in Chapter 1, I used the strontium isotope signature (⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr) preserved in the freshwater portion of otoliths to establish a baseline for the three natal rivers. The baseline data set was composed of otoliths from spawning adult <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> of known origin (n= 82). Subsequently, the baseline was used to classify commercially harvested <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> (n= 139) and determine the stock composition of the fishery. Greater than 97 % of the commercial samples were classified as Yukon River origin. However, 0. 7 %, and 1. 4 % of the commercial samples were classified as originating from Kuskokwim and Susitna rivers, respectively. In Chapter 2, I used the baseline data to classify <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> from three coastal rearing areas (Alaska Arctic coast, n= 49; Y-K Delta, n= 70; and the Alaska Peninsula, n= 8). More than 96 % of the coastal rearing <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> had ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr signatures consistent with a Yukon River origin. These data demonstrate the wide-spread coastal distribution of <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco,</b> with some travelling > 4, 900 km between coastal rearing and spawning habitats. This approach illustrates that ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr can determine the natal river of <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco.</b> Subsequently, this method can be used for stock discrimination and elucidating migration patterns for unknown origin <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco...</b>|$|E
40|$|Aspects of {{the biology}} and {{taxonomy}} of the Coregonus autumnalis species complex were investigated in this study. The taxonomic and zoogeographic relationship of Coregonus autumnalis and C. laurettae was examined using morphometric, meristic, and distribution data. The morphometric data, {{a series of}} head and body measurements, was analyzed using a discriminant function analysis. The percentage of fish misclassified in the analysis {{was found to be}} higher than what would be expected for two distinct species, and was more indicative of subspecies, or stocks. The only meristic variable found to be significantly different was gill raker counts for the lower branch of the first gill arch. This character was originally used to separate the two species. An examination of the distribution of gill raker counts between the sample sites along the Beaufort Sea coast revealed a consistent percentage of the fish from the Mackenzie River with gill raker counts representative of the Yukon River species. This percentage was maintained in the hypothesized area of sympatry between the two species. It was concluded, from this analysis, that the original description was incorrect in the establishment of two reproductively isolated species with a single area of sympatry, based on gill raker counts. The actual situation is more likely that of two allopatric subspecies, with no area of sympatry. The distribution data were also analyzed to determine the support for the original zoogeographic hypothesis proposed to explain the separation of the two forms. It was concluded that the Bering Land Bridge was probably not responsible for this, as the present-day distribution of the two populations does not reflect ranges that could have been fragmented by the uplifting of the land bridge. An alternative hypothesis, which better fits the current distribution patterns of each form, involves known stream captures and headwater transfers between the Mackenzie and Yukon Rivers. Insufficient information is presently available to determine the direction of the transfer, or through which river system the transfer was made. [...] Life histories were investigated at a number of levels. Arctic and <b>Bering</b> <b>cisco</b> populations were investigated using one-way analysis of variance and multiple analysis of covariance. No significant differences were found within the populations for reproductive variables but the two populations differed significantly from each other. It was concluded that, based on the occurrence of alternate spawning and its relatively short life span, Arctic cisco populations appeared unable to compensate reproductively for the rigorous conditions encountered in northern latitudes. Least cisco (C. sardinella) populations were investigated at the same levels. Between latitude comparisons were made using Mackenzie and Yukon River populations. As with Arctic ciscoes, {{no significant differences were found}} within populations for reproductive variables, but significant differences were seen in between population comparisons. It was concluded that northern least ciscoes, by virtue of their longer lifespan, are better able to compensate reproductively for the poor conditions encountered in the north than Arctic ciscoes. A second analysis of a number of least cisco populations inhabiting the same latitude found that anadromous populations were larger and more fecund. However, analysis of covariance detected no significant difference in fecundity between populations. An analysis of gonad weight among sympatric coregonines along the Beaufort Sea coast was conducted using an analysis of covariance but again, no significant difference was detected. A principal components analysis was used to determine patterns of life history variation in members of the subfamily Coregoninae using populations from North America and Eurasia. The effects of both phylogeny and latitude were examined. No significant trends in life history traits associated with latitude were found, although the subgenus Coreaonus (coregonus) did show a non-significant increase in egg size and number of broods with latitude, the subgenus Coregonus (leucichthys) showed non-significant inverse relationship for these variables and the genus Prosopium showed a nonsignificant inverse relationship for age and growth related variables. A number of genera and species appeared to be constrained by phylogeny and were unable to adapt completely to the environmental constraints imposed by northern environments. It was concluded that, despite this apparent inability to adapt, the great deal of variability of life histories demonstrated a large degree of plasticity in the subfamily...|$|E
