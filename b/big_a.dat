5|$|Meanwhile, Allenby's {{plan for}} 13 November {{was to turn}} the right flank of the Ottoman line on the coast despite {{aircraft}} and cavalry reconnaissances revealing a considerable Ottoman force further inland on the Egyptian Expeditionary Force's own right flank. He assigned the task of dealing with this immediate threat to the Australian Mounted Division, which was ordered to make as <b>big</b> <b>a</b> demonstration of their operations as possible. This would further focus Ottoman {{attention away from the}} coastal sector where the Anzac and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions would advance northwards to attempt to turn the Ottoman right flank assisted by infantry attacks on the Ottoman right centre the following day.|$|E

25|$|Jack Bush was a Canadian {{abstract}} expressionist painter, born in Toronto, Ontario in 1909. He was {{a member}} of Painters Eleven, the group founded by William Ronald in 1954 to promote abstract painting in Canada, and was soon encouraged in his art by the American art critic Clement Greenberg. With encouragement from Greenberg, Bush became closely tied to two movements that grew out of the efforts of the abstract expressionists: Color Field Painting and Lyrical Abstraction. His painting <b>Big</b> <b>A</b> is an example of his color field paintings of the late 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Later in February, federal {{authorities}} announced that no new residents could {{move into the}} town and that the current population would be relocated. The decision was made with the rationale that the landslides create too <b>big</b> <b>a</b> hazard for people {{to live in the}} current location and a “New Angangueo” would be built. However, local residents were against the plan. Efforts to relocate the town were officially begun in June 2010, with a projected 600 homes in a location called Barrio Sustentable Monarca. The construction was halted by September of the same year, with only a layout traced on the site and no new homes started.|$|E
25|$|The two, at {{the extreme}} of their rivalry, {{climbing}} the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman , used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, to me, {{it was clear that}} Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly then he would have cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too <b>big</b> <b>a</b> gear, which stopped his jumping away, I still think that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.|$|E
25|$|Rams (embolon) were {{fitted to}} the prows of warships, and {{were used to}} rupture the hull of the enemy ship. The {{preferred}} method of attack was to come in from astern, with the aim not of creating a single hole, but of rupturing as <b>big</b> <b>a</b> length of the enemy vessel as possible. The speed necessary for a successful impact depended on the angle of attack; the greater the angle, the lesser the speed required. At 60 degrees, 4 knots was enough to penetrate the hull, while it increased to 8 knots at 30 degrees. If the target for some reason was in motion {{in the direction of}} the attacker, even less speed was required, and especially if the hit came amidships. The Athenians especially became masters in the art of ramming, using light, un-decked (aphraktai) triremes.|$|E
