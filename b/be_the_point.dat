5|$|The {{scattered}} disc is a {{sparsely populated}} region, overlapping with the Kuiper belt but extending to beyond 100 AU. Scattered disc objects (SDOs) have very elliptical orbits, often also very inclined to the ecliptic. Most models of Solar System formation show both KBOs and SDOs first forming in a primordial belt, with later gravitational interactions, particularly with Neptune, sending the objects outward, some into stable orbits (the KBOs) and some into unstable orbits, the scattered disc. Due to its unstable nature, the scattered disc is suspected to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of origin {{of many of}} the Solar System's short-period comets. Their dynamic orbits occasionally force them into the inner Solar System, first becoming centaurs, and then short-period comets.|$|E
5|$|Foxgrover {{remained}} {{involved in}} the Millennium Park restaurant after she recused herself from contract negotiations in May, 2002. In October 2003, Foxgrover spoke {{in favor of the}} restaurant getting a liquor license before a Chicago City Council committee while O'Malley owed Foxgrover at least $5,000. On the same day, Foxgrover worked to get O'Malley's Clock Tower Cafe a liquor license. In one July 2003 e-mail, Foxgrover, then the acting director of park services, said that if O'Malley's contractor had any questions for the Park District, she will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> person. In August 2003, Horan sent out an e-mail mentioning a discussion Horan had with Foxgrover, in which Horan asked Foxgrover if the Park District would waive a form of insurance on the restaurant's construction. A provision in the Park Grill contract allows the restaurant to arrange a series of summer concerts on the Millennium Park ice-skating rink, drawing crowds that bolster food and drink sales. In summer 2004, O'Malley and his partners asked Clear Channel-owned WNUA Radio to conduct the concerts. In February 2005, Foxgrover led a five-member Park District committee that chose Clear Channel over JAM Productions to operate the new concert venue at Northerly Island on the former site of Meigs Field.|$|E
5|$|Further {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} the Kuiper belt later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually dispersing them. In order for comets to continue to be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently. One such area of replenishment is the Oort cloud, a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 AU from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. The Oort cloud is thought to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of origin of long-period comets, which are those, like Hale–Bopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.|$|E

5|$|Moons in {{retrograde}} orbits cannot form in {{the same}} region of the solar nebula as the planets they orbit, so Triton must have been captured from elsewhere. It might therefore have originated in the Kuiper belt, a ring of small icy objects extending outwards from just inside the orbit of Neptune to about 50AU from the Sun. Thought to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of origin {{for the majority of}} short-period comets observed from Earth, the belt is also home to several large, planet-like bodies including Pluto, which is now recognized as the largest in a population of Kuiper belt objects (the plutinos) locked in orbital step with Neptune. Triton is only slightly larger than Pluto and nearly identical in composition, which has led to the hypothesis that the two share a common origin.|$|E

25|$|The {{space of}} contact {{elements}} is a (2n – 1)-dimensional contact manifold Z2n – 1: {{in terms of}} the given choice of point spheres, these contact elements correspond to pairs consisting of a point in n-dimensional space (which may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at infinity) together with an oriented hyperplane passing through that point. The space Z2n – 1 is therefore isomorphic to the projectivized cotangent bundle of the n-sphere. This identification is not invariant under Lie transformations: in Lie invariant terms, Z2n – 1 is the space of (projective) lines on the Lie quadric.|$|E

Given S. dorsalis’ broad polyphagy and long history of pestilent behavior, it has been speculated that a weed such as castor that was adopted for agriculture may have been one of several hosts of origin, and that the thrips adapted and began to exploit other hosts as they became available in the changing agricultural landscape.|$|E

For supergiants, lines of silicon are used instead; the Si IV λ4089 and Si III λ4552 lines are indicative of early B. At mid B, the intensity of the latter relative to that of Si II λλ4128-30 is the defining characteristic, while for late B, it is the intensity of Mg II λ4481 relative to that of He I λ4471.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{believe that}} a 2-year-old boy was the index case of the current Ebola virus disease epidemic. He died in December 2013 {{in the village of}} Meliandou, Guéckédou Prefecture. His mother, sister, and {{grandmother}} then became ill with similar symptoms and also died. Although Ebola represents a significant public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and was documented in Tai Forest chimpanzees, only one case had been reported in humans in West Africa. With this background and in the context of poor public health systems, the early cases were mis-diagnosed as diseases more common to the area. Thus Ebola virus disease spread for several months before it was recognized as such. In late October 2014, the child was identified as Emile Ouamouno. In a Tuesday, December 30, 2014 online world news story article by Richard Ingham from the Agence France-Presse (AFP) that was featured on the MSN homepage, it was revealed that a tree in the area where children had played at, playing with insect-eating free-tailed bats and hunting and grilling them to eat (they are a cousin of another well-known Ebola reservoir, the fruit bat, whose role in this outbreak is not as clear), is believed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where human infection– likely by the bats– with Ebola in this current outbreak occurred, the 'ground zero' of the epidemic.
