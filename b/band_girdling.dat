A lady in a dressing-gown disturbs the mind and prevents careful consideration of the political outlook in Singapur, which is now supplied with a set of very complete forts, and is hopefully awaiting some nine-inch breach-loaders that are to adorn them.

It is possible that the Home Government may do that," [...] is the burden of the song, and in every place where the Englishman cannot breed successfully must continue to be. Imagine an India fit for permanent habitation by our kin, and consider what a place it would be this day, with the painter cut fifty years ago, fifty thousand miles of railways laid down and ten thousand under survey, and possibly an annual surplus. Is this sedition? Forgive me, but I am looking at the shipping outside the verandah, at the Chinamen in the streets, and at the lazy, languid Englishmen in banians and white jackets stretched on the cane chairs, and these things are not nice. The men are not really lazy, as I will try to show later on, but they lounge and loaf and seem to go to office at eleven, which must be bad for work. And they all talk about going home at indecently short intervals, as though that were their right. Once more, if we could only rear children that did not run to leg and nose in the second generation {{in this part of the}} world and one or two others, what an amazing disruption of the Empire there would be before half of a Parnell Commission sitting was accomplished!

40|$|Diatoms are microscopic, phototrophic, {{unicellular}} algae {{encased in}} a porous, rigid, siliceous, cell wall known as the frustule. They inhabit the euphotic zones in bodies of seawater and freshwater. The nutrient and trace element sorting characteristics of the diatoms frustule is not yet fully understood. It has been proposed that the <b>girdle</b> <b>band</b> pores of the marine diatom species (Coscinodiscus sp.) uses the drift ratchet mechanism to sort and separate nutrients and trace elements from harmful particles (i. e. viruses), based on the particle size. From initial numerical simulation results the <b>girdle</b> <b>band</b> pores do exhibit drift ratchet behaviour {{for a range of}} fluid flows.

In light-grown and greening cells, the chloroplast nucleoid forms a continuous cord or ring which closely follows the rim of each lateral lobe of the chloroplast and is continuous across {{the top and bottom}} of the bridge connecting the 2 chloroplast lobes. The nucleoid always lies just inside the chloroplast <b>girdle</b> <b>bands</b> where they loop around the rim of the plastid. It was demonstrated by electron-microscopic autoradiography of greening cells labelled with [3 H]-thymidine that all the plastid DNA is localized in this peripheral ring-shaped nucleoid.

It is postulated that the <b>girdle</b> <b>bands</b> determine the shape of the chloroplast nucleoid, possibly by having specific attachment sites for the plastid DNA molecules. A survey of the literature shows that a peripheral ring-shaped chloroplast nucleoid is a characteristic feature of the 5 classes of algae whose chloroplasts possess <b>girdle</b> <b>bands,</b> namely the Raphidophyceae, Chryso-phyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Xanthophyceae, and Phaeophyceae, and has never been observed in plants whose plastids lack <b>girdle</b> <b>bands...</b>|$|R

50|$|Although a {{thorough}} understanding of how this happens requires a mathematical development (see references), the diagram can provide a conceptual understanding. Observe the two <b>bands</b> shown <b>girdling</b> the stream—one at a peak and the other at a trough of the wave. At the trough, the radius of the stream is smaller, hence according to the Young-Laplace equation the pressure due to surface tension is increased. Likewise at the peak the radius of the stream is greater and, by the same reasoning, pressure due to surface tension is reduced. If this were the only effect, we would expect that the higher pressure in the trough would squeeze liquid into the lower-pressure region in the peak. In this way we see how the wave grows in amplitude over time.|$|R

40|$|Diatoms are {{eukaryotic}} microalgae {{that produce}} species-specifically structured cell walls made of SiO 2 (silica). Formation of the intricate silica structures of diatoms {{is regarded as}} a paradigm for biomolecule-controlled self-assembly of three-dimensional, nano- to microscale-patterned inorganic materials. Silica formation involves long-chain polyamines and phosphoproteins (silaffins and silacidins), which are readily soluble in water, and spontaneously form dynamic supramolecular assemblies that accelerate silica deposition and influence silica morphogenesis in vitro. However, synthesis of diatom-like silica structure in vitro has not yet been accomplished, indicating that additional components are required. Here we describe the discovery and intracellular location of six novel proteins (cingulins) that are integral components of a silica-forming organic matrix (microrings) in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. The cingulin-containing microrings are specifically associated with <b>girdle</b> <b>bands,</b> which constitute a substantial part of diatom biosilica. Remarkably, the microrings exhibit protein-based nanopatterns that closely resemble characteristic features of the <b>girdle</b> <b>band</b> silica nanopatterns. Upon the addition of silicic acid the microrings become rapidly mineralized in vitro generating nanopatterned silica replicas of the microring structures. A silica-forming organic matrix with characteristic nanopatterns was also discovered in the diatom Coscinodiscus wailesii, which suggests that preassembled protein-based templates might be general components of the cellular machinery for silica morphogenesis in diatoms. These data provide fundamentally new insight into the molecular mechanisms of biological silica morphogenesis, and may lead to the development of self-assembled 3 D mineral forming protein scaffolds with designed nanopatterns for a host of applications in nanotechnology...|$|R

We calculated the relative density of the frustule to be ∼ 30 % and show that at this density the frustule has the highest strength-to-density ratio of 1, 702 kN⋅m/kg, a significant departure from all reported biologic materials. We also performed nanoindentation on both the single basal layer of the frustule as well as the <b>girdle</b> <b>band</b> and show that these components display similar mechanical properties that also agree well with bending tests. Transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that the frustule is made almost entirely of amorphous silica with a nanocrystalline proximal layer.

Finite element simulations of the three-point bending experiments show that the basal layer carries most of the applied load whereas stresses within the cribrum and areolae layer are an order of magnitude lower.

40|$|Chitin is a {{globally}} abundant polymer {{widely distributed}} throughout eukaryotes {{that has been}} well characterized {{in only a few}} lineages. Diatoms are members of the eukaryotic lineage of stramenopiles. Of the hundreds of diatom genera, two produce long fibers of chitin that extrude through their cell walls of silica. We identify and describe here genes encoding putative chitin synthases in a variety of additional diatom genera, indicating that the ability to produce chitin is more widespread and likely plays a more central role in diatom biology than previously considered. Diatom chitin synthases fall into four phylogenetic clades. Protein domain predictions and differential gene expression patterns provide evidence that chitin synthases have multiple functions within a diatom cell. Thalassiosira pseudonana possesses six genes encoding three types of chitin synthases. Transcript abundance of the gene encoding one of these chitin synthase types increases when cells resume division after short-term silicic acid starvation and during short-term limitation by silicic acid or iron, two nutrient conditions connected in the environment and known to affect the cell wall. During long-term silicic acid starvation transcript abundance of this gene and one additional chitin synthase gene increased {{at the same time a}} chitin-binding lectin localized to the <b>girdle</b> <b>band</b> region of the cell wall. Together, these results suggest that the ability to produce chitin is more widespread in diatoms than previously thought and that a subset of the chitin produced by diatoms is associated with the cell wall...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{interest}} in diatom genomics, detailed time series of gene expression in relation to key cellular processes are still lacking. Here, we investigated {{the relationships between the}} cell cycle and chloroplast development in the pennate diatom Seminavis robusta. This diatom possesses two chloroplasts with a well-orchestrated developmental cycle, common to many pennate diatoms. By assessing the effects of induced cell cycle arrest with microscopy and flow cytometry, we found that division and reorganization of the chloroplasts are initiated only after S-phase progression. Next, we quantified the expression of the S. robusta FtsZ homolog to address the division status of chloroplasts during synchronized growth and monitored microscopically their dynamics in relation to nuclear division and silicon deposition. We show that chloroplasts divide and relocate during the S/G 2 phase, after which a <b>girdle</b> <b>band</b> is deposited to accommodate cell growth. Synchronized cultures of two genotypes were subsequently used for a cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism-based genome-wide transcript profiling, in which 917 reproducibly modulated transcripts were identified. We observed that genes involved in pigment biosynthesis and coding for light-harvesting proteins were up-regulated during G 2 /M phase and cell separation. Light and cell cycle progression were both found to affect fucoxanthin-chlorophyll a/c -binding protein expression and accumulation of fucoxanthin cell content. Because chloroplasts elongate at the stage of cytokinesis, cell cycle-modulated photosynthetic gene expression and synthesis of pigments in concert with cell division might balance chloroplast growth, which confirms that chloroplast biogenesis in S. robusta is tightly regulated...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of auxospores and initial {{cells of the}} freshwater chain-forming diatom Ellerbeckia arenaria forma arenaria was studied using light and electron microscopy. Whether the auxospore mother cell is formed vegetatively (parthenogenesis) or through autogamy, is still a matter of speculation. Because no signs of spermiogenesis could be detected in our material, we exclude oogamy. Further development involves retraction of the protoplast from the epivalve {{and the formation of}} a featureless siliceous cap with a central opening on its free surface. The homology and function of this cap remains uncertain. At {{the other end of the}} cell the protoplast remains tightly attached to the hypovalve throughout its further development. This hypovalve always has a concave valve face. An organic wall bearing many layers of overlapping, small silica scales begins formation while the cell is still enclosed within the mother cell wall, and allows the auxospore to swell, thus breaking the siliceous cap and <b>girdle</b> <b>bands.</b> External and internal surfaces of scales can be distinguished morphologically. Initial valves are formed internal to the scales at an oblique angle to the parent chain. The initial epivalve always faces the hypotheca of the auxospore mother cell, and the initial valves already show elements of the heterovalvy manifest in the vegetative cells. The significance of the observations in terms of ecology and phylogeny is discussed. The combinations Ellerbeckia arenaria (Moore ex Ralfs) R. M. Crawford, and E. arenaria forma teres (Brun ex Schmidt) R. M. Crawford are validated...|$|R
