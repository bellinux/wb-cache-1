40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} fix-referenced and self-referenced wave energy converters and a comparison of their corresponding wave energy <b>conversion</b> <b>capacities</b> from real seas. For conducting the comparisons, two popular wave energy converters, point absorber and oscillating water column, and their power <b>conversion</b> <b>capacities</b> in the fixed-referenced and self-referenced forms have been numerically studied and compared. In the numerical models, the device’s power extractions from seas are maximized using the correspondingly optimized power take-offs in different sea states, thus their power <b>conversion</b> <b>capacities</b> can be calculated and compared. From the comparisons and analyses, it is shown that the energy <b>conversion</b> <b>capacities</b> of the self-referenced devices can be significantly increased if the motions of the device itself can be utilized for wave energy conversion; and the self-referenced devices can be possibly designed to be compliant in long waves, which {{could be a very}} beneficial factor for device survivability in the extreme wave conditions (normally long waves). In this regards, the self-referenced WECs (wave energy converters) may be better options in terms of wave energy conversion from the targeted waves in seas (frequently the most occurred), {{and in terms of the}} device survivability, especially in the extreme waves when compared to the fix-referenced counterparts...|$|R

Isolations were performed in 2004 from survey plots and in 2006 from larger areas of two forest management units.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the enantiomeric resolution of epoxides by resting 1 pentene grown Xanthobacter Py 2 cells. The strain had been originally isolated on propene. Growth on 1 pentene as sole carbon source was obtained {{after a lengthy}} adaptation period, during which cells were repeatedly subcultured {{with the addition of}} yeast extract at the intermediate stages. Batch production of the bio catalyst was optimised, resulting in a culture density of 0. 63 gdw / L with 19 % of the sealed flask occupied by broth (1 pentene is gaseous at 30 Deg C), using an initial 1 pentene concentration of 0. 1 % (v/v). The biomass yield on 1 pentene was 0. 49 Ceq/Ceq. Problems associated with the toxicity of the epoxides towards the cells and also with the low solubility and instability of epoxides in water were solved by implementing a two phase biotransformation system, consisting of phosphate buffer containing the freely suspended cells, and a biocompatible organic substrate reservoir (iso-octane or n-dodecane). A maximum specific 1, 2 apoxyhexane conversion rate of 25 nmol / min mg protein was attained when cells harvested from a batch fermentation in the late exponential phase were used. In this biphasic system, the epoxide <b>conversion</b> <b>capacity</b> of the whole cells was limited, even in the presence of co-substrates. Substitution of the buffer by mineral medium resulted in growth of the strain (using the epoxide as carbon and energy source) and in a enhanced epoxide <b>conversion</b> <b>capacity</b> of the system.

40|$|The Methanol-to-Olefins (MTO) {{process for}} the {{production}} of polymer-grade olefins is a possible step in the upgrading of natural gas. The preferred MTO catalyst is the microporous silicoaluminophosphate H-SAPO- 34 (CHA topology). In the present work, H-SAPO- 34 is compared with H-SSZ- 13 which has the same topology and density of acid sites, but is slightly more acidic due to the framework composition. This is a one-parameter study where the effect of acidity on the MTO-process is investigated. Both materials are very similar as catalysts for the conversion of methanol, the effluent and retained hydrocarbons contain mainly the same compounds. It is found that H-SSZ- 13 has a lower total <b>conversion</b> <b>capacity</b> than H-SAPO- 34. Both catalysts displayed an optimum temperature, but under the same conditions (Weight Hourly Space Velocity= 6. 2 hr- 1) the optimum temperature of H-SSZ- 13 (350 ° C) was 50 °C below that of H-SAPO- 34 (400 ° C). The production of retained hydrocarbons was faster in H-SSZ- 13, which also produced larger ring compounds than H-SAPO- 34 at the same conditions. Upon flushing with He it was possible to discriminate between the active and non-active compounds in the retained material. The more methylated benzenes were the most reactive ones in both catalysts. In H-SAPO- 34 at 350 ° C only penta- and hexamethylbenzene were active, while also tetramethylbenzene was active in H-SSZ- 13. When decreasing the temperature to 300 °C, tetramethylbenzene was no longer protonated in H-SSZ- 13, so it appears that higher acid strength has an effect comparable to increasing the temperature. Changing WHSV had a great impact on the catalyst properties, such as optimum temperature and <b>conversion</b> <b>capacity.</b> Halving WHSV increased the optimum temperature of H-SAPO- 34 to 450 ° C. A theoretical study of the adsorption of methanol and CO on the acid sites of the two catalysts is also presented in this thesis.
