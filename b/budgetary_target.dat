40|$|Purpose - This paper {{discusses}} {{the impact that}} Japanese culture has on the budgeting process using insights gained from the literature and from a single company small-sample pilot study. It provides a research agenda which links specific aspects of Japanese culture to predictions about Japanese groups’ budgetary, performance evaluation and variance investigation practices. Design/methodology/approach – A detailed literature review of the relevant literature in accounting, education and sociology, which considers how Japanese culture systematically differs from Western culture, and a small-sample pilot study. Findings - We find that the Singaporean subsidiary of the Japanese MNC we studied uses common Japanese budgeting practices, as previously documented by Ueno and Sekaran (1992). Line managers are rewarded based on overall actual companywide profit, consistent with the Japanese collectivist group-orientation which is itself a product of Confucianism. Although variances are used to rectify operational problems on a timely basis, line managers are not rewarded for outperforming the budget - the budget is a stick, {{but there is no}} offsetting carrot. An interviewed line manager (Chinese Singaporean, Purchasing) expressed mixed feelings about the current reward system and a preference for rewards based on outperforming his own <b>budgetary</b> <b>target.</b> This observation is consistent with some research in the educational literature suggesting that Chinese tend to be less collectivist than Japanese. Originality/value – Literature review provides a synthesis of a diverse variety of sources. The literature review and pilot study findings add to the accounting literature by studying in more detail than prior studies exactly how and why Japanese culture characteristics will and should affect budgetary practice. The paper should be of special value and interest to higher-degree and early-career researchers. ...|$|E

30|$|From {{a policy}} perspective, that {{government}} compensations spill {{over to the}} private sector is a non-trivial question. First of all, the strength and the persistence of the spill over says something about the supply-side effects of aggregate demand management, allowing for a more sophisticated modelling of the overall economic impact of government spending. More to the point, the issue is especially relevant in the euro area context where countries have lost the ability to recoup cost competitiveness by means of devaluation but have scope to decide on the composition, efficiency and equity of their government spending. Finally, our research provides an indication of the relevance of wage setting modalities in the public sector.

In contrast to this, the present study examines the extent to which budgets have a more positive, 'comforting' role to play in the individual's work experiences. We argue that managers confronted with uncertainties associated with role ambiguity may respond by becoming positively committed to achieving <b>budgetary</b> <b>targets</b> as budgets offer a source of structure and certainty. We find that the use of budgets as an antidote to role ambiguity is a powerful influence on the manager's budgeting behaviour. We test the strength of this effect and we find that budgetary commitment brought on by the experience of role ambiguity may over-ride the potential for recognised explanatory variables such as leadership style, the expectations of the superior, and occupational socialisation, to inform managers' budgeting behaviours in these circumstances. Budgets, it seems, may be as useful to the individual as they are problematic...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: From 2000 to 2004, {{primary care}} organisations (PCOs) in England were legally {{required}} {{to operate a}} prescribing incentive scheme for their general practices. A statutory framework specified the types of target, maximum rewards and use of `good cause for failure' provisions that schemes should include. Our objective was to explore whether schemes might be a useful approach to encourage `good quality' prescribing. Methods: We requested copies of the original schemes from all PCOs in England in 2001 and 2002. Data were extracted on the rewards offered, types of <b>budgetary</b> <b>targets</b> set and additional conditions specified. Results: Many schemes had not been finalised, some PCOs had no scheme, and one scheme operated without rewards. Although schemes covered similar therapeutic areas, they varied considerably in their length, complexity, reward levels and reward structure. Over half the schemes contained no `good cause for failure' provision. Discussion/conclusion: PCOs are offering diverse incentives to general practices and some have interpreted the statutory framework imaginatively.

When GE dismantled its conglomerate in the 1950s, its existing performance measures, which relied on centralized <b>budgetary</b> <b>targets,</b> needed to evolve {{to suit the}} newly decentralized company. The 1951 GE Measurement Project provided a template for the new performance measures, which were orthogonal to the old performance measures, {{as well as to}} each other. The new measures were [...] "profitability, market position, productivity, product leadership, personnel development, employee attitudes, public responsibility", and balance between short-term and long-term goals. Thirty years later, when the company was in dire straits, the performance measurements were functionally consolidated into ranked profitability and growth. With this strategy, GE annually swept away the bottom 10% of its performers in profitability and growth. Once GE regained financial and market stability, the performance evaluation metrics changed in response, allegedly expanding and taking on more humanistic values. GE illustrates two important notes about changing performance metrics. First, new performance measures are most useful when they are unrelated {{to each other and to}} existing measures. Second, performance measures tend towards elaboration during times of security and profitability, and likewise tend towards consolidation during times of urgency and strain.|$|R
30|$|The {{linkages}} highlighted {{here are}} not meant to capture causality; nevertheless, they still offer some insights into understanding the possible labour market impact of changes in the government wage bill. Our evidence is suggestive of the fact that wage-bill-based fiscal consolidations can affect the external sector leading to competitiveness improvements and possibly to an adjustment of macroeconomic imbalances. By contrast, our analysis is unfit to quantify {{the extent to which the}} composition of budget consolidation contributes to cushioning negative output effects of fiscal adjustment via the demand channel. One secondary implication is that the sequencing of fiscal consolidations in a monetary union should be set in such a way to allow each member state to fully benefit from potential supply-side effects via the labour market. Finally, we contribute to unpacking the effects of government wage consumption by accounting for the institutional setting against which public wages are set. Our evidence seems to suggest that bargaining is generally more efficient in terms of its effects on the labour market. Nevertheless, this is a new unexplored topic that would deserve greater attention and additional work so as to better capture the conditions for an optimal trade-off between efficiency, equity and the need to respect <b>budgetary</b> <b>targets.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on the expenditure side of the budgetary process. It examines the impact of corruption on public spending decision-making and budget execution, especially in the occurrence of fiscal slippages, also by assessing the characteristics of corrupt behaviours across the various phases of the budgetary process. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to briefly review the related literature and discuss the impact of corruption on the budget process, through the empirical investigation of fifteen EU countries,-super- 2 paying particular attention to Greece. Applying simple econometric techniques on a sample of fifteen old EU members and for the period 1995 - 2006, two main effects of corruption are considered: corruption influences the decisions on public spending allocation and, is positively correlated on the one hand, with the level of public expenditure allocated for general public services, defence, order and safety, economic affairs and culture, while on the other hand, is negatively correlated with the so-called social expenditure. A secondary impact of corruption related to the execution phase of the budget, is that corruption affects the accuracy of expenditure, pushing public spending above the <b>budgetary</b> <b>targets</b> and leading to systematic budget expenditure overshooting and thus, to continuous fiscal slippages and poor budgetary performance.
