25|$|In 1939, Russell Marker, a {{professor}} of organic chemistry at Pennsylvania State University, developed a method of synthesizing progesterone from plant steroid sapogenins, initially using sarsapogenin from sarsaparilla, which proved too expensive. After three years of extensive botanical research, he discovered a much better starting material, the saponin from inedible Mexican yams (Dioscorea mexicana and Dioscorea composita) found in the rain forests of Veracruz near Orizaba. The saponin could be converted in the lab to its aglycone moiety diosgenin. Unable to interest his research sponsor Parke-Davis in the commercial potential of synthesizing progesterone from Mexican yams, Marker left Penn State and in 1944 co-founded Syntex with two partners in Mexico City. When he left Syntex a year later the trade of the <b>barbasco</b> yam had started and {{the period of the}} heyday of the Mexican steroid industry had been started. Syntex broke the monopoly of European pharmaceutical companies on steroid hormones, reducing the price of progesterone almost 200-fold over the next eight years.|$|E
50|$|Laboratorios Syntex SA was a {{pharmaceutical}} company formed in Mexico City in 1944 by Russell Marker to manufacture therapeutic steroids from the Mexican yams called cabeza de negro (Dioscorea mexicana) and <b>Barbasco</b> (Dioscorea composita). The demand for <b>barbasco</b> by Syntex initiated the Mexican <b>barbasco</b> trade.|$|E
50|$|By the mid 1970s 125,000 Mexican peasants {{depended}} on the <b>barbasco</b> trade for their livelihood, and ten tons of <b>Barbasco</b> per week were extracted from the wild.|$|E
50|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s it became {{possible}} to produce steroids from soy phytosterols, including progesterone. This meant that <b>barbasco</b> {{was no longer}} necessary as a base product, and international reliance on Mexican yam stopped. Today only a few communities in Northern Oaxaca continue to produce <b>barbasco,</b> and the few existing beneficios process only a few tons per year. In 1999 65% of families in the municipio of Santiago Jocotepec depended on <b>barbasco</b> production, whereas in the municipios of San Juan Lalana it was 29.2%, in San Felipe Usila 28.3 and in San Lucas Ojitlan 24.4%.|$|E

50|$|Quickly {{a system}} of {{middlemen}} appeared, as those who had enough means to pay barbasqueros, started buying large quantities, often using {{a system of}} debt peonage. They would start by giving the barbasquero a loan {{which he or she}} would then have to pay off with <b>barbasco.</b> These middlemen would eventually establish acopios, recollection and distribution centrals where large quantities of <b>barbasco</b> are gathered and shipped on to the beneficios, the processing plants.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, populist President Luis Echeverría sought to {{organize}} and nationalize the <b>barbasco</b> trade in order to derive more benefit to the barbasqueros and to the Mexican state. He established the organization PROQUIVEMEX (Productos Químicos Vegetales de México). However, at this point Mexico had lost {{its status as a}} world leader of the synthetic hormone market and the <b>barbasco</b> trade was declining, just as the root was becoming depleted in the wild.|$|E

The poisoned arrow penetrates almost without the prez feeling it; the poison circulates rapidly and, half a minute later, the animal falls, completely dead. [...] Another way to catch the animals was through traps known as 'toclla', which hold the prey suspended in the air. They also capture birds with this trap (toclla). For fishing, they use traps and <b>barbasco.</b> <b>Barbasco</b> is a plant that contains poisonous chemical compounds that have been used for fishing by indigenous populations of the Americas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Barbasco</b> is {{toxic to}} insects, fish, and other pets. The primary threat to humans and other mammals comes from inhaling the {{powdered}} root or root extract. It {{has been used}} by the Shuar people of Ecuador and the Nukak people of Colombia as a poison for fishing.|$|E

50|$|In the 1950s, {{the wild}} yam known as <b>barbasco</b> was {{discovered}} to contain steroid hormones {{that could affect}} human fertility {{and led to the}} development of The Pill. A Mexican research company, Syntex was founded and began producing oral contraceptives. The Mexican government under President Luis Echeverría created a state-run company, Proquivemex, to control and regulate the industry.|$|E
50|$|Knowledge of {{the uses}} and {{purposes}} of the <b>barbasco</b> tuber was highly stratified and barbasqueros often {{did not know the}} true purpose of the root they were gathering: they were frequently told that it was used for soap. The acopio owners knew more about the process and eventually invented ways of improving the diosgenin concentration in roots collected by adding different solvents to the tubers before shipping them to the beneficios.|$|E
5000|$|Dioscorea mexicana {{ranges from}} the state of San Luis Potosí in northeastern Mexico south to Panama. [...] It is notable for its {{production}} of diosgenin, which is a precursor for the synthesis of hormones such as progesterone. Russell Marker developed the extraction and manufacture of hormones from D. mexicana at Syntex.

Legumes such as soybean and chickpeas are the major source of saponins in the human diet. Sources of non-dietary saponins include alfalfa, sunflower, herbs and <b>barbasco.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Mexican <b>barbasco</b> {{trade was}} {{the trade of}} the diosgenin-rich yam species Dioscorea mexicana, Dioscorea floribunda and Dioscorea composita which emerged in Mexico in the 1950s {{as part of the}} Mexican steroid industry. The trade {{consisted}} in Mexican campesinos harvesting the root in the jungle, selling it to middlemen who brought it to processing plants where the root was fermented and the diosgenin extracted and sold to pharmaceutical companies such as Syntex who used it to produce synthetic hormones.|$|E
50|$|The trade {{started when}} Russell Marker, a chemist {{looking for a}} plant source from which to extract {{diosgenin}} and saponin, traveled to Veracruz looking for the yam Dioscorea mexicana which he suspected might be suitable. He hired two Mexican campesinos to bring him exemplars of the tuber. When he discovered that the root was indeed {{a significant source of}} diosgenin he established Syntex, the first Mexican fine chemical company dedicated to producing semisynthetic hormones from <b>Barbasco.</b> Before this development, natural hormones were extracted from animal sources, such as urine from pregnant mares or women, or from bull testes; prices were consequently very high. With the development of the process of Marker degradation which allowed the production of hormones from vegetable saponin sources, Marker began a search for a plant steroid of the sapogenin class with a ring structure more like progesterone. With the discovery of the chemical properties of the <b>barbasco</b> root, world market prices for steroids and other synthetic hormones plummeted - making them feasible for large scale production of medicines for common ailments such as arthritis or Addison's disease, and eventually {{as the basis for the}} combined oral contraceptive pill.|$|E
50|$|Dioscorea composita, or <b>barbasco,</b> is {{a species}} of yam in the genus Dioscorea, native to Mexico. It is notable for {{its role in the}} {{production}} of diosgenin, which is a precursor for the synthesis of hormones such as progesterone. Russell Marker developed the extraction and manufacture of hormones from D. mexicana at Syntex, starting the trade of D. composita in Mexico. Marker also discovered that the composita variety had a much higher content of diosgenin than the mexicana variety, and therefore it came to replace the latter in the production of synthetic hormones.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally {{in these}} communities, the women {{went out to}} work in the chacras and the men went to hunt and fish. Their days would start by {{drinking}} chicha or guayusa. Both of these are plants that are dried and brewed as tea. Traditional cuisine from these communities (Quijos- Quichua) do not use salt. They replace salt with ash from certain plants. Some food products in their diet include: sweet potato, plantain (and/or banana), yuca, corn (maize), rice, beans, chonta, heart of palm , chili, honey, meat and fish. They also cultivated granadillas, chirimoya, logmas, <b>barbasco,</b> ayahuasca and tobacco.|$|E
50|$|This {{development}} {{sparked a}} <b>barbasco</b> extraction industry {{centered on the}} barbasco-rich areas of southeastern Mexico, in Northern Oaxaca, Southern Veracruz and Puebla states. Especially the area called Chinantla in Northern Oaxaca, around the cities of Tuxtepec and Valle Nacional. The root was extracted in the wild by barbasqueros, often poor Indigenous Chinantecs, who ventured into the jungle to dig out the tuber with digging sticks or with their bare hands. Before becoming used industrially, the tuber was used by Chinantec healers in northern Oaxaca as an abortifacient and in cures for aching joints. It was also used by Chinantecs as a poison for fishing in the Papaloapan river.|$|E
50|$|The {{important}} role of hormones in human health was already known, but ways to synthesize them were unknown. George Rosenkranz's skills as a chemist attracted the interest of Emeric Somlo, a Hungarian immigrant, and Dr. Federico Lehmann at Syntex in Mexico City, Mexico. They had formed the company in 1944 to work with Russell Marker, a Penn State professor, and sought to synthesize the hormone progesterone from diosgenin-containing Mexican yams, which would eventually give rise to the Mexican <b>barbasco</b> trade. After a disagreement Marker left, taking his steroid knowledge with him. Rosenkranz was recruited to replace him, and moved to Mexico City in 1945.|$|E

50|$|Emeric Somlo, Federico Lehmann and Russell Marker came {{together}} to make a new company in Mexico named Syntex SA. This company used Mexican plant, Cabeza de Negro (Dioscorea mexicana), to create progesterone. Species of the genus Dioscorea contain diosgenin: a saponin similar to the structure of sarsasapogenin found in beth root. In March 1944, the company made the first kilo of progesterone, which was sold at $50/gram. After a dispute in the company in 1945, Marker severed ties with Syntex SA. Because Marker was {{the only person in the}} company who knew how to do the synthesis of progesterone, they could no longer produce the drug. Marker however went to work with Botanica-mex, a company based in Texcoco. The company later was sold to Gedeon Richter Ltd. where they started using both cabeza de negro and <b>barbasco</b> (yam) to make progesterone.|$|E
