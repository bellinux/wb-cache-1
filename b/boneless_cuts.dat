This study examines the outlook in major export markets for New Zealand lamb, {{in terms of the}} prices and level of demand, and the global market for New Zealand lamb in terms of aggregate supply and demand, the change in stocks, and the world price. This required the identification of market segments within the international lamb market and the estimation of demand and price response parameters for each market segment, using a suitable theoretical model. Econometric estimates were obtained using a joint product model, which allowed production to be estimated as a single commodity, while demand and price equations for each market segment were estimated for up to six related cuts of lamb: chilled and frozen carcasses, chilled and frozen bone-in cuts, and chilled and frozen <b>boneless</b> <b>cuts.</b> Estimates were used in a spreadsheet model to generate forecasts for each of the identified markets.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} nature and {{performance}} of the New Zealand sheep meat industry from 1980 to 2007. As almost 94 per cent of sheep meat produced in New Zealand is exported {{the focus of this}} study is on the export sector of the sheep meat industry, and in particular, the lamb meat export industry. Deregulation of the New Zealand economy led to a fundamental change of philosophy within the sheep meat industry. Government support was reduced in the mid- to late- 1980 s, and financial deregulation was initially associated with rising interest rates and high exchange rates. After an initial adjustment period, interest rates fell, but variable exchange rates have remained. After having a high level of involvement in the processing and marketing sectors through ownership of both processing companies and product, the role of the New Zealand Meat Board reduced in the mid- 1990 s to that of an industry-good role, managing quota and allocating research funding. In the sheep meat industry, markets and market destinations have not changed dramatically over the study period 1980 - 2007, but the product form has undergone some quite radical changes. The nature of the product now being sold has been transformed from a frozen carcass to a range of both chilled and frozen, and bone-in and <b>boneless</b> <b>cuts</b> of lamb. Over the period concerned, supermarkets have emerged as the dominant prescriber of specifications, and these specifications have become more demanding. This study has identified a number of factors that have been important in transforming the sheep meat industry from a heavily subsidised, production-driven sector to one that is more market-oriented operating in a market economy. The study has also identified factors that underpin the continued instability of the industry as a whole, and specifically, low profitability for process-exporting companies and variable returns for farmers...|$|E

40|$|Muscularity is a meat animal {{characteristic}} {{defined as}} the depth of muscle relative to skeletal dimensions. It is usually assessed subjectively, but a possible objective measure involves obtaining an average muscle depth by taking the square root of the weight per unit length of muscles around the femur, and expressing this relative to femur length. A series of experiments was conducted to assess this objective measure of muscularity (MUSC), {{and the value of}} muscularity as a meat production trait. These involved evaluation of first, the pattern of change in MUSC with growth of sheep from birth to near maturity, secondly, relationships between MUSC {{in different parts of the}} carcass, thirdly, relationships between MUSC and muscle fibre size and number, fourthly, breed differences in MUSC, fifthly, relationships between MUSC measured objectively and subjectively, and finally, indirect predictors of MUSC based on simple measurements. Southdown rams from lines selected for high- or low-backfat depths (n= 40 per line) were studied at birth, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 kg liveweight and at near maturity. Muscularity and M:B ratios from different groups of muscles and bones, together with other indexes of carcass shape, including the depth to width ratio of a transverse section of M. longissimus and a carcass weight to length ratio (CWT:L 3), increased at a decreasing rate with increasing carcass weight. For most ratios this increase was parallel for both lines with the high-backfat line having higher values, but for muscularity in the femur region the differences between the lines increased with growth. Muscularity based on the muscles around the femur showed line differences most clearly. Line differences in muscularity did not appear to be associated with consistent differences in bone shape. Proportions of muscle fibre types in the M. semitendinosus were generally similar for the two selection lines. Data from 211 carcasses from 4 trials were evaluated to study differences between breed and sex groups of sheep in the pattern of change in muscularity with increasing carcass weight. Leg muscularity increased for all groups with increasing carcass weight, and the rate of increase was similar at carcass weights above 10 kg. The Southdown breed had higher muscularity values and M:B ratios than Texel crosses, which in turn had higher values than all other groups. For some comparisons, there were important sex effects. At a similar carcass weight, Coopworth rams had slightly higher muscularity values (+ 1. 7 %; P< 0. 10), but lower M:B values (- 8. 8 %; P< 0. 001) than Poll Dorset-cross cryptorchids. Relationships between objective measures of muscling and subjective scores of muscularity or conformation were studied using data from 95 lambs and 90 bulls. Muscularity calculated from the leg cut rather than whole side or eye-muscle dimensions had the closest relationships with subjective scores of muscularity or conformation (R 2 % = 69 to 80 % for lambs and 56 % for bulls), with leg M:B being only slightly inferior (R 2 % = 62 % for lambs and 52 % for bulls). Muscularity and M:B ratio calculated from the side were the next best as predictors, but variables based on the eye muscle were poor. Data from 5 trials were used to examine indirect objective methods to predict leg muscularity for sheep carcasses. Muscularities based on M. semimembranosus or M. biceps femoris were accurate predictors when compared with indexes based on other individual muscles. Muscularities based on the topside and outside commercial <b>boneless</b> <b>cuts</b> were also good predictors. Indexes of muscularity calculated from carcass linear and eye-muscle dimensions were poor as predictors. Leg width to length (W/L) ratios obtained from lateral leg photographs proved useful as predictors. Individual W/L values or groups of W/L values combined as bands were moderately effective as predictors for some trials. However, the regression prediction equations varied between trials. It is concluded that the objective measure of carcass muscularity investigated here is a carcass characteristic that reflects important differences in carcass shape, and that differences in this characteristic between carcasses are not necessarily accompanied by corresponding changes in muscle to bone ratio...|$|E

They were fabricated into bone-in or <b>boneless</b> foodservice <b>cuts</b> and associated components by trained meat cutters. Once fabrication was completed, data were analyzed to determine means and standard errors on percentage yields and timing scores for each subprimal. Each style selected was used to generate mean foodservice yields and labor requirements, which were calculated from foodservice weights (kg) and processing times (s). Subprimals consisting of only one cutting style were evaluated for mean foodservice yields and processing times and, no comparisons were made within cut. These subprimals included: rib-roast ready; ribeye roll, lip-on, bone-in; boneless brisket, deckle-off; inside round; and bottom sirloin flap. Subprimals consisting of multiple cutting styles also were evaluated for mean foodservice yields and processing times, and comparisons were made within cut. These subprimals included: ribeye rolls; top sirloin caps; tenderloin butts; ribeye rolls, lepton; shorthorns; strip loins; top sirloin butts; and tenderloins. Significant variations in foodservice yields and cutting times were found within cutting styles. In general, as the target portion size decreased, the number of steaks increased, causing total foodservices yield to decrease and total processing time to increase. Furthermore, an inverse relationship tended to exist between processing times and foodservice yields.

40|$|Breeding {{goals in}} pigs {{are subject to}} change and are {{directed}} much more toward retail carcass yield and meat quality because of the high economic value of these traits. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate genetic parameters of growth, carcass, and meat quality traits. Carcass components included ham and loin weights as primal cuts, which were further dissected into <b>boneless</b> subprimal <b>cuts.</b> Meat quality traits included pH, drip loss, purge, firmness, and color and marbling of both ham and loin. Phenotypic measurements were collected on a commercial crossbred pig population (n = 1, 855). Genetic parameters were estimated using REML procedures applied to a bivariate animal model. Heritability estimates for carcass traits varied from 0. 29 to 0. 51, with 0. 39 and 0. 51 for the boneless subprimals of ham and loin, respectively. Heritability estimates for meat quality traits ranged from 0. 08 to 0. 28, with low estimates for the water holding capacity traits and higher values for the color traits: Minolta b*(0. 14), L* (0. 15), a* (0. 24), and Japanese color scale (0. 25). Heritability estimates differed for marbling of ham (0. 14) and loin (0. 31). Neither backfat nor ADG was correlated with loin depth (rg = 0. 0), and their mutual genetic correlation was 0. 27. Loin primal was moderately correlated with ham primal (rg = 0. 31) and more strongly correlated with boneless ham (rg = 0. 58). Backfat was negatively correlated with (sub) primal cut values. Average daily gain was unfavorably correlated with subprimals and with most meat quality characteristics measured. Genetic correlations among the color measurements and water-holding capacity traits were high (average rg = 0. 70), except for Minolta a* (average rg = 0. 17). The estimated genetic parameters indicate that meat quality and valuable cut yields can be improved by genetic selection. The estimated genetic parameters make it possible to predict the response to selection on performance, carcass, and meat quality traits and to design an effective breeding strategy fitting pricing systems based on retail carcass and quality characteristic...|$|R
40|$|Global beef {{markets are}} highly {{influenced}} by sanitary issues, mainly related to animal health and food safety, {{which have been}} determining levels and trends in global beef trade. Food safety issues affecting human health such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) associated with Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (vCJD) in humans, and other diseases affecting production such as {{foot and mouth disease}} (FMD) has encouraged putting these issues to beef trade attention. A way to address these concerns and comply with international standards is the use of traceability systems in order to quickly identify hazard sources and assure beef quality and safety. The goal of this research was to assess the effect of exporting countries sanitary status of BSE and FMD, and traceability systems in beef export prices and to examine Paraguayan beef exports relative to other exporting countries. Data of the top beef exporters was collected from the United Nations Commodity Trade Database (UN Comtrade), including export operations volume and receipt with each of their trading partners, from 2000 to 2012. Four commodities were studied: Frozen and Fresh/Chilled bone-in and <b>boneless</b> beef <b>cuts.</b> The data was analyzed using ordinary least squares regression methods (a hedonic price equation). Five models were run, one for each commodity and lastly one with all four together. Results revealed that both FMD and BSE affect negatively to beef exports prices, as well as shipments from India, that has no official FMD status and any traceability system in place. Apart from sanitary status, epidemiological events also {{have a negative impact on}} beef prices. On the other hand, the implementation of traceability systems improves prices. In this scenario, Paraguay lags behind in the adoption of emerging markets standards for traceability systems, therefore does not access most competitive markets, which pay higher prices.

40|$|Due to the {{complexity}} and dynamism of the global beef market, policymakers need a theoretically consistent, rigorous and quantitative analysis to validate and quantify the effects of different factors that are believed to drive beef trade. The general objective of this dissertation was to validate and quantify the factors that drive and influence international beef trade {{in order to facilitate}} and improve the decision-making behaviour of policymakers. The gravity model methodology was identified as the ideal framework to address the general objective of this dissertation, and was used as the primary tool to analyse the factors that drive and influence beef trade. The specific objectives were to gain an understanding of prominent issues that influence international beef trade, to review the gravity modelling methodology and to model the effects of various issues on the volume of beef trade based on trade data among leading importers and exporters between 1996 and 2010. A model was estimated using two separate equations, referred to as Model B 1 and Model B 2. For each of these equations the dependant variable varied to represent: bovine <b>cuts</b> <b>boneless,</b> fresh or chilled (HS 020130); bovine <b>cuts</b> <b>boneless,</b> frozen (HS 020230); and an aggregation of these two products designated as "Total beef". Model B 1 was estimated with the full gravity model specification, including export prices. Since very few studies on commodity specific gravity models exist and have never modelled beef exports prices directly, it was decided to run an additional model, Model B 2, without the export price variable. The Wald Chi-square test confirmed that the variables included in the model were significant in explaining the variation in the volume of exports. Issues that were included in the specification included beef production in a beef exporter, beef consumption in a beef importer, tariff measures applied by importing countries, income per capita of consumers in importing countries, export prices and trade bans due to animal diseases. The coefficients of individual variables estimated were found to be plausible while the signs of the coefficients indicated the expected relationships between the volume of beef trade and each of the individual issues. After comparing the two models {{it was found that the}} price variable exhibited statistically significant and plausible results, and did not affect the estimates of the other variables. A comparison with similar studies revealed that the model developed in this dissertation estimated similar results in some areas, and even more plausible results in others. When all of the statistical tests and validation criteria are taken into account, the gravity model developed in this dissertation was successful in validating and quantifying the factors that drive and influence international beef trade.

They were fabricated into bone-in or <b>boneless</b> retail <b>cuts</b> and associated components by trained meat cutters. Each style selected (n = 6) was used to generate mean retail yields and labor requirements, which were calculated from wholesale and retail weights (kg) and processing times (s). Means and standard errors for veal ribs consisting of five different styles (n 30) revealed that style # 2, 7 rib 4 (10 cm) x 4 (10 cm), had the lowest percentage of total retail yield (P <. 05) due to the greatest percentage bone. Furthermore, rib style # 2 required the most total processing time (P <. 05). Rib styles # 3, 7 rib chop ready, and # 5, 6 rib chop ready, yielded the greatest percentage total retail yield and also had the lowest total processing time (P <. 05). Within veal loins, style # 2, 4 (10 cm) x 4 (10 cm) loin kidney fat in, had the greatest percentage fat (P <. 05). Loin styles # 2 and # 3, 4 (10 cm) x 4 (10 cm) loin special trimmed, generated more lean and fat trimmings, and bone, resulting in lower percentage total retail yields than loin style # 1, 0 (O cm) x 1 (2. 5 cm) loin special trimmed (P <. 05). Results showed that bone-in subprimals and sections required more processing time if fabricated into a boneless endpoint. In addition, as the number of different retail cuts increased, processing times also increased.

Boxed pork was obtained to represent four different purchasing specifications common in the industry to conduct a study on yields, labor requirement, and value and profit assessment. Boxes of bone-in loins (n = 180), boneless loins (n = 94), Boston butts (n = 148), fresh hams (n = 28), and boneless hams (n = 23) were shipped to the Rosenthal Meat Science and Technology Center at Texas A&M University to perform cutting yields and time tests in a simulated retail cutting room. Subprimals within each purchasing specification were allotted randomly to cutting styles. Processing times (sec) and retail weights (kg) were obtained to determine relative value and retail yields (%). Retail yields ranged from 71. 12 to 95. 28 % for bone-in loins, 94. 92 to 98. 57 % for boneless loins, 88. 45 to 98. 59 % for Boston butts, 59. 54 to 60. 24 % for fresh hams, 99. 97 to 100. 12 % for inside fresh pork leg, 99. 36 to 100 - 01 % for outside fresh pork leg, and 98. 88 to 100. 45 % for tenderloins. Cutting times were increased up to three-fold when bone-in subprimals were taken to <b>boneless</b> endpoints. <b>Cutting</b> style affected (P [. 05) retail yield, total processing time, and value differential (US $/. 4536 kg) for bone-in loins. Cutting time and value for boneless loins differed (P [. 05) by cutting style. Boston butt retail yield and cutting time were affected (P [. 05) by cutting style. When cutting styles within subprimals were pooled, bone-in loin, boneless loin, Boston butt, and outside fresh pork leg percentage of retail yield were influenced (P [. 05) by purchasing specification. Purchasing specification affected (P [. 05) processing time for bone-in loins, boneless loins, fresh hams, inside fresh pork leg, and outside fresh pork leg. Value differential was impacted (P [. 05) by purchasing specification for bone-in loins, boneless loins, Boston butts, and inside fresh pork leg. With cutting style and purchasing specification influencing retail yield and cutting time the following linear regression model was developed for each subprimal with more than one cutting style: y g + si +pj +spij + eijk where y is the predicted percentage retail yield or processing time, g is the intercept, si is the effect of cutting style, pj is the effect of purchasing specification, spij is the effect of the interaction of cutting style and purchasing specification, and eijk is the error term which is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance of a 2. This model explained between 21 and 93 % of the variability associated with percentage of retail yield and between 81 and 91 % of the variability associated with cutting time for subprimals with more than one cutting style. Due to the numerous combination of factors that can affect retail yield, cutting time, and retail value of pork the computer program generated from this data will aid the retailer in making marketing and purchasing decisions that have been time consuming in the past...|$|R

Pork carcasses (n = 199) were selected to represent the current U. S. population: 25 % US 1, 36 % US 2, 25 % US 3, and 14 % US 4. Carcasses were selected at six processing plants from five companies by a trained USDA grader. Carcasses were shipped to Texas A&M University where sides were randomly assigned two cutting procedures. Side A was fabricated into regular trimmed four lean cuts (RFLC). Side B was fabricated into bone-in and <b>boneless</b> four lean <b>cuts</b> (FLC) by progressively trimming s. c. fat to. 64,. 32, and 0 cm and the remainder separated into remaining fat, lean, bone, and skin to generate a boneless, 0 cm trimmed, seam fat removed (BLSFLC) endpoint. Remaining lean was separated into chemical fat and moisture (FFLFLC). During fabrication, carcass cross sections were photographed onto slide film, scanned, and then various fat and muscle deposits were measured with an image analysis program. Regression equations were produced using carcass cross section measurements to predict RFLC and bone-in and boneless FLC progressively trimmed to. 64,. 32, and 0 cm, BLSFLC, and FFLFLC. Twelfth rib fat depth 3 / 4 measure (TW 5) and M. longissimus area (TW 7) accounted for 81 % of the variation in RFLC. Twelfth rib fat and muscle depth 1 / 2 distance measures (TW 3 and TW 4) produced R 2. 79. Skinned, bone-in FLC progressively trimmed had R 2 of. 61,. 68. and. 73 when using TW 5 and TW 7. R 2 dropped only. 01 for each trim level when using TW 3 and TW 4. TW 5 and TW 7 had R 2 =. 55,. 64,. 70, and. 78 and TW 3 and TW 4 were within. 0 1 for every equation in predicting. 64,. 32, and 0 cm FLC and BSLFLC, respectively. TW 3 and TW 4 had R 2 =. 81 (. 01 higher than TW 5 and TW 7) for predicting FFLFLC. Adding additional fat or muscle measurements to a fat and muscle measure over the M. longissimus at any location had minimal improvement in R 2...|$|R
40|$|Mature {{pregnant}} crossbred ewes (n = 90) {{were used}} in a randomized complete block design experiment and were assigned to 1 of 3 winter-feeding systems differing in primary feed source: haylage (HL), limit-fed corn (CN), or limit-fed dried distillers grains (DDGS). Effects of these winter-feeding strategies on postweaning progeny performance were determined. Lamb progeny (n = 96) were weaned at 61 +/- 4 d of age and fed a common high-concentrate diet. Lambs were assigned to feedlot pen (n = 18) based on dam mid-gestation pen. Growth rate, DMI, and ADG were determined for the first 40 d of the finishing period. At 96 +/- 4 d of age, 1 wether lamb was randomly selected from each pen (n = 18) for a glucose tolerance test. The experiment was terminated, and lambs were slaughtered individually when they were determined to have achieved 0. 6 -cm 12 th-rib fat thickness. After a 24 -h chill, carcass data were collected and a 2. 54 -cm chop was removed from each lamb from the LM posterior to the 12 th rib for ether extract analysis. Additional carcass measurements of bone, muscle, and fat from the shoulder, rack, loin, and leg were collected on 35 carcasses. At weaning, lamb BW was not different among treatments, whereas final BW tended to be greater (P = 0. 09) for lambs from ewes fed DDGS and CN during gestation than from those fed HL. Overall lamb growth rate from birth to slaughter was not different among treatments. Lambs from ewes fed DDGS vs. CN or HL tended {{to have a greater}} initial insulin response (P = 0. 09). Dressing percent was less (P = 0. 04) in lambs from ewes fed DDGS, but no difference (P = 0. 16) was detected in HCW among treatments. As expected, 12 th rib fat thickness was similar among treatments, whereas LM area was largest to smallest (P = 0. 05) in lambs from ewes fed CN, HL, and DDGS, respectively. Proportion of internal fat tended to be greatest to smallest (P = 0. 06) in lambs from ewes fed DDGS, CN, and HL, respectively. Calculated <b>boneless</b> trimmed retail <b>cuts</b> percentage was less (P = 0. 04) in lambs from ewes fed DDGS than CN or HL. Loin muscle weight as a percentage of wholesale cut tended (P = 0. 10) to be greater in lambs from ewes fed CN and HL than DDGS, whereas other muscle, bone, and fat weights and proportions were similar (P > 0. 24) among treatments. Prepartum diet during mid to late gestation of ewes altered postnatal fat and muscle deposition and may be associated with alterations in insulin sensitivity of progeny...|$|R
