5|$|Initially most Luftwaffe fighter wings {{consisted}} of three groups (Gruppe), which were the equivalent of USAAF groups or RAF Wings. Groups were identified using Roman numerals, followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> number; e.g. I./JG 1. In 1942 JG 1 was the first unit to be expanded to incorporate a fourth group. Partly {{as a result of}} JG 1's expansion, other Luftwaffe fighter wings incorporated a fourth group from mid-1943.|$|E

5|$|JG 27 {{was moved}} out of Africa {{for about a month}} because of the impact Marseille's death had on morale. The deaths of two other German aces, Günter Steinhausen and Marseille's friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt, just three weeks earlier reduced spirits to an all-time low. One biographer {{suggests}} these consequences were instigated by a failure in the command style of Marseille, although it was not entirely within his control. The more success Marseille had, the more his staffel relied on him to carry the greater share of aerial victories claimed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit.</b> So his death, when it came, was something which JG 27 had seemingly not prepared for.|$|E
5|$|Personnel {{assigned}} to the FMPU included {{some of the most}} well known film professionals of the day, as well as filmmakers who would have great success after the war. Actors such as Clark Gable, William Holden and Alan Ladd, and directors including Richard Bare and John Sturges served with the unit. Future president Ronald Reagan, who transferred from the cavalry reserve, was a captain in the unit. He was the personnel officer and was responsible for maintaining personnel files and orienting new recruits to the operational aspects of Fort Roach. Later he was appointed adjutant. Like the other notable actors Reagan appeared in the films produced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit,</b> but to avoid distracting the audience they were eventually relegated to narrating the films.|$|E
25|$|The mobile {{chemical}} warfare laboratory operated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> had been constructed {{in recognition of}} its need to be mobile in Australia in event of enemy chemical attack, and potentially {{to be used in}} the Pacific area of operations. The tasks and processes adopted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> were similar to those of British units, and were well established by the time they settled in at St Johns Wood. The Laboratory was tasked with the examination of enemy chemical weapons, ammunition, and protective clothing and respirators.|$|E

25|$|Low {{levels of}} gamma rays cause a {{stochastic}} health risk, which for radiation dose assessment {{is defined as}} the probability of cancer induction and genetic damage.

These effects are compared to the physical quantity absorbed dose measured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> gray (Gy).|$|E
25|$|Properly, {{the uniform}} is {{referred}} to as the official field uniform.

25|$|An {{important}} {{practical application}} of covering spaces occurs in charts on SO(3), the rotation group. This group occurs widely in engineering, due to 3-dimensional rotations being heavily used in navigation, nautical engineering, and aerospace engineering, {{among many other}} uses. Topologically, SO(3) is the real projective space RP3, with fundamental group Z/2, and only (non-trivial) covering space the hypersphere S3, which is the group Spin(3), and represented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> quaternions. Thus quaternions are a preferred method for representing spatial rotations – see quaternions and spatial rotation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} four full months of {{operation}} in Southeast Asia, crews of the 12th TRS flew 2,014 combat sorties against pinpoint, strip, and area cover targets in North Vietnam, South Vietnam, and Laos. Approximately two-thirds of these were flown at night. Continuous information on enemy supply movements, troop concentrations, and fortifications was obtained from aerial photography taken by the 12th. In addition, photography taken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> was used in bomb damage assessment, base defense planning, and enemy air defense site detection. The 12th flew more than 26,000 combat sorties and 53,000 hours over a 5-year period. This was more than in both World Wars and Korea combined.|$|E

Back in New York in 1920, Alice Seligsberg formed Junior Hadassah, which provided innovative programs for young women who wanted to participate in Hadassah's Zionist mission.

25|$|When {{turned on}} or opened, the AED will {{instruct}} {{the user to}} connect the electrodes (pads) to the patient. Once the pads are attached, everyone should avoid touching the patient {{so as to avoid}} false readings <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit.</b> The pads allow the AED to examine the electrical output from the heart and determine if the patient is in a shockable rhythm (either ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia). If the device determines that a shock is warranted, it will use the battery to charge its internal capacitor in preparation to deliver the shock. This system is not only safer (charging only when required), but also allows for a faster delivery of the electric current.|$|E
