25|$|The U.S. fiscal {{position}} changed dramatically {{for the worse}} during the <b>Bush</b> <b>years.</b> CBO projected in its January 2001 baseline that the U.S. would have a total of $5.6 trillion in annual surpluses over the 2002-2011 decade, assuming the laws in place during the Clinton era continued and the economy performed as expected. However, the actual deficits during those years ended up being $6.1 trillion, a negative swing of $11.7 trillion. Two recessions, two wars, and tax cuts were the primary drivers of the differences.|$|E
500|$|Backspacer {{received}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, {{and is the}} band's best reviewed studio album of the 2000s according to Metacritic, where it received a score of 79 out of 100 based on reviews from 24 professional critics. AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album {{four and a half}} out of five stars, saying that [...] "it sounds as if they enjoy being in a band, intoxicated by the noise they make." [...] Ann Powers of The Los Angeles Times gave the album four out of four stars, describing it as [...] "11 breakneck rockers and candidly emotional ballads, adding up to barely more than a half hour of optimally toned catharsis" [...] and praising the [...] "lightness and dexterity of the playing" [...] and [...] "Vedder's hard-driving, often playful vocals", and called its music [...] "Accessible without sacrificing sophistication, aggressive without flailing". Rolling Stone staff writer Rob Sheffield gave Backspacer four out of five stars, saying that it contains [...] "the shortest, tightest, punkiest tunes they've ever banged out," [...] and that [...] "Eddie Vedder's heart-on-fire vocals are the main attraction, as always." [...] He added, [...] "After toughing out the <b>Bush</b> <b>years,</b> Pearl Jam aren't in the mood for brooding; at long last, surf's up." [...] Dave Simpson of The Guardian also gave the album four out of five stars. In the review he stated that [...] "the Seattle quartet have rarely sounded this energised." [...] Simpson observed that [...] "this is a record made by mature men with perspective: full of reflection and eclecticism, finding space for both U2 guitar motifs and Buzzcocks solos." [...] He added that [...] "the ninth Pearl Jam album may even be the best of the lot." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters gave the album a rating of 7/10 and wrote that Pearl Jam [...] "have finally re-discovered who they are, and sound stronger than ever because of it".|$|E

[...] If Texas had been half this consistent all season, it'd be playing in a bowl game [...] But Mack Brown will settle for a better-late-than-never performance with an impressive 52–34 victory over the Pac-10 co-champion Sun Devils in a Holiday Bowl that was just shorter than the <b>Bush</b> <b>years.</b> [...] Texas had made a habit of finishing strong with some spirited fourth-quarter rallies all season, but this time it started stronger than garlic breath and never let up. [...] This Texas team knocked the ever-living stuffing out of ASU. This Texas team showed fire, showed passion and mostly showed up. These Longhorns finished the year with a fulfilling game that could possibly squeeze them into the top 10 and should titillate their fans for eight months and stoke a high 2008 preseason national ranking.” ...|$|E
