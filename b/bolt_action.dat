5|$|The {{first episode}} in the saga of German {{unification}} under Bismarck came with the Schleswig-Holstein Question. On 15 November 1863, King Christian IX of Denmark became king of Denmark and duke of Schleswig and Holstein. On 18 November 1863, he signed the Danish November Constitution and declared the Duchy of Schleswig a part of Denmark. The German Confederation saw this act {{as a violation of}} the London Protocol of 1852, which emphasized the status of the kingdom of Denmark as distinct from the independent duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. The populations of Schleswig and Holstein, furthermore, greatly valued this separate status. The German Confederation could use the ethnicities of these duchies as a rallying cry: large portions of both Schleswig and Holstein were of German origin and spoke German in everyday life (though Schleswig had a sizable Danish minority). Diplomatic attempts to have the November Constitution repealed collapsed, and fighting began when Prussian and Austrian troops crossed the border into Schleswig on 1 February 1864. Initially, the Danes attempted to defend their country using an ancient earthen wall known as the Danevirke, but this proved futile. The Danes were no match for the combined Prussian and Austrian forces, and they could not rely on help from their allies in the other Scandinavian states because Denmark had nullified its alliance rights by violating the London Protocol. The Needle Gun, one of the first <b>bolt</b> <b>action</b> rifles to be used in conflict, aided the Prussians in both this war and the Austro-Prussian War two years later. The rifle enabled a Prussian soldier to fire five shots while lying prone, while its muzzle-loading counterpart could only fire one shot and had to be reloaded while standing. The Second Schleswig War resulted in victory for the combined armies of Prussia and Austria, and the two countries won control of Schleswig and Holstein in the concluding peace of Vienna, signed on 30 October 1864.|$|E
25|$|Rifles (both <b>bolt</b> <b>action</b> and semi-automatic) {{of other}} calibers, shotguns, {{and other types}} of weapons may be used for other game such as ptarmigan, Arctic hares, and Arctic foxes, which are often {{encountered}} during a reindeer hunt.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{its growing}} {{civilian}} popularity, several high quality tactical and match (semi) custom <b>bolt</b> <b>actions</b> {{designed for the}} [...]338 Lapua Magnum are becoming available. These (semi) custom <b>bolt</b> <b>actions</b> are used with other high grade rifle and sighting components to build custom sporting and target rifles.|$|R
50|$|Today most {{top-level}} smallbore match rifles are single-shot <b>bolt</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|All Swedish Mauser <b>bolt</b> <b>actions</b> were proof {{tested with}} a single 6.5×55mm proof round {{developing}} approximately [...] piezo pressure (55,000 CUP).|$|R
25|$|Lever-action guns {{represent}} the earliest successful repeating actions. Essentially unchanged {{for over a}} century, lever action rifles are faster to operate than a <b>bolt</b> <b>action,</b> though the traditional designs and tubular magazines used limit the pressures and bullet shapes that can be used. The use of lever action hunting rifles is deeply embedded in American culture.|$|E
25|$|Both the {{propellant}} charge {{appropriate for}} the required range and the bomb were loaded via the muzzle. Usually a Lee–Enfield rifle's <b>bolt</b> <b>action</b> mechanism was screwed into the breech. A special blank rifle cartridge was loaded and was triggered by pulling a lanyard, and fired into an igniter {{at the base of}} the mortar chamber, igniting the propellant charge and launching the bomb.|$|E
25|$|The Allied troops, led by Lionel Sadleir-Jackson, {{were soon}} {{combined}} with Poles and White Guard forces. Fighting was heavy along both {{banks of the}} Northern Dvina. The River Force outflanked the enemy land positions with amphibious assaults led by US Marines, together with coordinated artillery support from land and river. Their Lewis gun {{proved to be an}} effective weapon, since both sides were only armed with the <b>bolt</b> <b>action</b> rifles.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{high quality}} large {{tactical}} and match (semi) custom <b>bolt</b> <b>actions</b> {{were designed for}} the [...]408 Cheyenne Tactical cartridge and were becoming available as of 2007. These semi-custom <b>bolt</b> <b>actions</b> are used with other high grade rifle and sighting components to build custom sporting and target rifles. Such rifles are ordered by long-range accuracy oriented shooters and built by specialized, highly skilled gunsmiths and can cost thousands of dollars. When built to expectation such rifles are very accurate—0.5 MOA or better consistent accuracy for a particular rifle optimized ammunition is considered normal. Only expert marksmen can make use of this extreme accuracy potential.|$|R
5000|$|Single-shot <b>bolt</b> <b>actions</b> in [...]22 caliber {{were also}} widely {{manufactured}} as inexpensive [...] "boys' guns" [...] {{in the earlier}} 20th century; {{and there have been}} a few single-shot bolt-action shotguns, usually in [...]410 bore.|$|R
5000|$|Based on the Record {{full bore}} sport {{shooting}} rifle series Izhmash also developed the SV-338, SV-338M, and SV-338 M1 sniper rifles chambered for the [...]338 Lapua Magnum cartridge. These rifles feature scaled-up magnum <b>bolt</b> <b>actions</b> but {{are similar to}} the SV-98.|$|R
25|$|Symons {{believed}} in old fashioned military tactics of close order, where by concentrating {{troops on the}} attack he hoped to smash the Boer defences. The reality was that these formations were not designed to be used against long range <b>bolt</b> <b>action</b> rifles and Symons' brigades {{would be the first}} of many in this war to pay the heavy cost of the mistake, as many generals would repeat it. However, his orders for the cavalry commander, Colonel Möller, were less conventional, telling him to act on his own initiative; it would be another costly mistake.|$|E
25|$|The British Bren {{light machine}} gun with a rate of fire of 500 rounds a minute and 30 round magazine, came up against the German MG 42 which had a rate of fire of 1,500 rounds per minute and {{ammunition}} belts of 200 rounds. The standard British rifle was the <b>bolt</b> <b>action</b> Lee–Enfield Rifle, No. 4 Mk I that outmatched the standard German rifle of the war, the Karabiner 98k; later German rifles included the Semi-automatic rifles Gewehr 41, Gewehr 43 and the first assault rifle the StG 44.|$|E
25|$|The Timberwolf {{action is}} a {{manually}} operated stainless steel <b>bolt</b> <b>action</b> with a right-hand side bolt and ejection port. The bolt is a rotary bolt with dual front locking lugs plus one locking lug at the rear. It requires a 90-degree bolt rotation. the bolt is partly helically fluted which reduces weight and stops bolt debris jams. A double plunger ejector and hook type extractor are used to remove fired cartridge cases. This helps create a very smooth action which is very reliable. The extra locking lug at the rear assists in preventing the bolt from becoming jammed when chambering another round.|$|E
25|$|Bolt-action {{weapons are}} rugged, reliable, and {{typically}} the most accurate, {{due to the}} strong camming action that locks the bolt into the receiver. The disadvantage is that <b>bolt</b> <b>actions</b> require removing the firing hand from the trigger to operate the bolt, which requires more time between shots than other repeating actions.|$|R
50|$|The Tippmann TPX {{operates}} {{on an open}} <b>bolt</b> blow-forward <b>action</b> system.|$|R
50|$|The Norwegian Army {{currently}} (2008) use the Våpensmia NM149 and NM149-F1 sniper rifles, {{which are}} based on Karabiner 98k <b>bolt</b> <b>actions.</b> Besides Mauser M 98 system actions, captured by Norway at the end of World War II in 1945, contemporary components originating from several manufacturers are used by Våpensmia A/S to build the NM149 and NM149-F1.|$|R
25|$|The Parachute Regiment {{were not}} issued any special weapons. Their small arms {{were the same}} {{as the rest of the}} army's: the <b>bolt</b> <b>action</b> Lee–Enfield rifle and the Enfield or Webley {{revolver}} or the M1911 pistol. For a submachine gun, they used the British Sten in Northwest Europe, which was issued in higher numbers than to a normal infantry battalion. Paratroopers attached to Eighth Army used the Thompson submachine gun in the North African and Mediterranean theatre and during Operation Dragoon. Each section had a Bren light machine gun and the platoon had a 2-inch mortar. The only battalion heavy weapons were eight 3-inch mortars, four Vickers machine guns and after 1943, ten PIAT anti tank weapons.|$|E
25|$|When a {{cartridge}} is fired, {{the internal}} pressure expands {{the case to}} fit the chamber in a process called obturation. To allow ease of chambering the cartridge when it is reloaded, the case is swaged back to size. Competition shooters, using <b>bolt</b> <b>action</b> rifles {{that are capable of}} camming a tight case into place, often resize only the neck of the cartridge, called neck sizing, as opposed to the normal full length resizing process. Neck sizing is only useful for cartridges to be re-fired in the same firearm, as the brass may be slightly oversized in some dimensions for other chambers, but the precise fit of case to chamber will allow greater consistency and therefore greater potential accuracy. Some believe that neck sizing will permit a larger number of reloads with a given case in contrast to full size resizing, although this is controversial. Semi-automatic rifles and rifles with SAAMI minimum chamber dimensions often require a special small base resizing die, that sizes further down the case than normal dies, and allows for more reliable feeding.|$|E
25|$|The camel {{companies}} {{consisted of}} a small headquarters and four sections, each of seven groups of four men. The {{establishment of a company}} was 130 men, all armed with Lee–Enfields, the standard British <b>bolt</b> <b>action</b> rifle of the time. However the move from patrol to a more active combat role in August 1916 led to a re-organisation. Each company added a machine-gun section of fifteen men with three Lewis guns; the company headquarters also received extra staff. All this increased company strength to 184 men. The four companies were expected to operate as independent units that travelled by camel but then dismounted to fight as infantrymen. Following the practise of cavalry and mounted infantry units, one man of each group of four held the camels when the team was in action, which reduced a team's firepower by a quarter. However it was soon discovered that camels were not as nervous as horses when faced with artillery and rifle fire, and one man would look after twelve to sixteen camels once the troopers had dismounted.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the most common bolt-action systems, other designs have been devised that failed to achieve the ubiquity of the turn-bolt Mauser, Lee-Enfield and Mosin-Nagant designs. Some of the most notable of these are the Canadian Ross rifle, the Swiss Schmidt-Rubin and Austro-Hungarian Mannlicher M1895 designs. All three are straight-pull <b>bolt</b> <b>actions,</b> but are entirely unrelated designs.|$|R
50|$|The 9.3×64mm Brenneke can be {{chambered}} in standard-sized Mauser 98 bolt-action rifles. The M 98 <b>bolt</b> <b>actions</b> {{and magazine}} boxes of standard military Mauser 98 rifles, however, {{have to be}} adapted by a competent gunsmith to function properly with these magnum cartridges since their cases are longer and have a larger diameter than the 8×57mm IS service cartridges.|$|R
5000|$|The player {{controls}} Bolt, {{who makes}} use of the Tokobots to explore the prehistoric ruins found in the game. The Tokobots mimic <b>Bolt's</b> <b>actions</b> {{and can be used}} together in [...] "joint actions", complex tasks that include fusing them together to make Karakuri combinations. Combinations can do almost anything, from activating dead gears to shooting laser beams.|$|R
25|$|The IDF {{possesses}} top-of-the-line {{weapons and}} computer systems. Some gear {{comes from the}} US (with some equipment modified for IDF use) such as the M4A1 and M16 assault rifles, the M24 SWS 7.62mm <b>bolt</b> <b>action</b> sniper rifle, the SR-25 7.62mm semi-automatic sniper rifle, the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets, and the AH-1 Cobra and AH-64D Apache attack helicopters. Israel has also developed its own independent weapons industry, which has developed weapons and vehicles such as the Merkava battle tank series, Nesher and Kfir fighter aircraft, and various small arms such as the Galil and Tavor assault rifles, and the Uzi submachine gun. Israel has also installed {{a variant of the}} Samson RCWS, a remote controlled weapons platform, which can include machine guns, grenade launchers, and anti-tank missiles on a remotely operated turret, in pillboxes along the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier intended to prevent Palestinian militants from entering its territory. Israel has developed observation balloons equipped with sophisticated cameras and surveillance systems used to thwart terror attacks from Gaza. The IDF also possesses advanced combat engineering equipment which include the IDF Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozer, IDF Puma CEV, Tzefa Shiryon and CARPET minefield breaching rockets, and a variety of robots and explosive devices.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]303 British has 3.64 ml (56 grains H2O) {{cartridge}} case capacity. The pronounced tapering exterior {{shape of the}} case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in <b>bolt</b> <b>action</b> rifles and machine guns alike, under challenging conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Extremely {{thick-walled}} brass {{results in}} a 7.40 ml (114 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity for the [...]338 Lapua Magnum. The exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable feeding and extraction in <b>bolt</b> <b>action,</b> semi-automatic, and automatic firearms alike, under extreme conditions.|$|E
50|$|The Blaser R8 has an {{uncommon}} detachable box magazine/trigger unit. When detached it renders the rifle inoperable and safe. To avoid accidents with set triggers, Blaser offers the R8 {{only with a}} direct trigger. The compact detachable box magazine/trigger unit contributes to balancing the rifle, as the Blaser straight pull action is about 50 to 60 mm shorter than conventional <b>bolt</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Swiss Vetterli rifles {{combined}} the American Winchester Model 1866's tubular magazine {{with a regular}} bolt featuring {{for the first time}} two opposed rear locking lugs. This novel type of bolt was a major improvement over the simpler Dreyse and Chassepot <b>bolt</b> <b>actions.</b> The Vetterli was also the first repeating bolt-action rifle to feature a self-cocking action and a small caliber bore.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the Inhuman Royal Family {{return from}} space and contact Reed Richards, hoping to reunite with their people. While {{trying to find}} the lost Inhuman nation with Cerebro, Richards discovers <b>Bolt's</b> <b>actions.</b> The Skull's army reaches New York, {{overtaking}} it, and Captain America and his allies fall to the Skull's powers. While the Skull is distracted, Captain America kills the child dictator and liberates his followers.|$|R
2500|$|The Colt M16A2 {{may be used}} by SWAT marksmen when {{a longer}} ranged weapon is needed. Common sniper rifles used are M14 rifle and the Remington 700P. Many {{different}} variants of <b>bolt</b> <b>action</b> rifles are used by SWAT, including limited use of [...]50caliber sniper rifles for more intense situations.|$|E
2500|$|A {{total of}} 21,000 Boers {{advanced}} into Natal from all sides. The only regular uniformed units were the Staatsartillerie of both republics (and some units of policemen {{such as the}} South African Republic Police or ZARP). The rest were mainly farmers, dressed in their ordinary working clothes, with some townsmen and contingents of foreign volunteers known as Vrijwilligers. All were mounted, and most were armed with Mauser <b>Bolt</b> <b>action</b> rifles.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006 {{the only}} hunting weapons allowed for {{reindeer}} harvesting were <b>bolt</b> <b>action,</b> non-automatic rifles, using [...]222 Remington caliber cartridges or larger. A good, large rifle scope is important, as shots at longer distances may be necessary, and visibility may be poor because of snowfall, fog, or limited lighting levels. Folding or fixed-blade hunting knives {{are necessary for}} many purposes. Binoculars with large objective diameter are used to spot prey at great distances, sometimes in waning light.|$|E
5000|$|Once a {{standard}} rifle calibre, {{the rise of}} Mauser's Gewehr 98 <b>bolt</b> <b>actioned</b> rifles offered cheaper alternatives to the expensive double rifles required by the Nitro Express cartridges. A few manufacturers still make rifles chambered in [...]577 Nitro Express due to its popularity, including Hartmann & Weiss, Heym, Holland & Holland, Butch Searcy & Co., James Purdey and Sons, Westley Richards, and Hambrusch Hunting Weapons.|$|R
5000|$|There are a {{great number}} of rifles (and even a few handguns, such as adapted Howdah pistols) {{chambered}} for the [...]375 H&H. Many types of actions are used, including single-shots, double-rifles, and <b>bolt</b> <b>actions.</b> When hunting dangerous game, a double-rifle or a controlled-feed bolt-action rifle is most commonly recommended, as a quick follow-up shot may be necessary, and reliability of the firearm becomes of paramount importance.|$|R
50|$|The M 98 <b>bolt</b> <b>actions</b> and {{magazine}} boxes of standard military Mauser 98 rifles {{have to be}} adapted by a competent gunsmith to function properly with these magnum cartridges since the cases are longer and have a larger diameter than the 8×57mm service cartridges. In properly adapted standard military Gewehr 98 or Karabiner 98k service rifles the large 6.5×68mm cartridges are, however, praised for very smooth and reliable feeding.|$|R
