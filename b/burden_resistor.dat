5000|$|Alternating {{currents}} {{are relatively}} easy to measure as transformers can be used.A current transformer is commonly used to measure alternating currents. The current to be measured is forced through the primary winding (often a single turn) and the current through the secondary winding is found by measuring the voltage across a current-sense resistor (or [...] "burden resistor"). The secondary winding has a <b>burden</b> <b>resistor</b> to set the current scale. The properties of a transformer offer many advantages. The current transformer rejects common mode voltages, so an accurate single-ended voltage measurement can be made on a grounded secondary. The effective series resistance [...] of the primary winding is set by the <b>burden</b> <b>resistor</b> on the secondary winding [...] and the transformer turns ratio , where: [...]|$|E

40|$|The DC current {{transducer}} (DCCT) and accompanying A/D converter determine {{the precision of}} a power converter in accelerator operation. In the LHC context this precision approaches 10 - 6 (1 ppm). Inside the DCCT a <b>burden</b> <b>resistor</b> is used to convert the current to an output voltage. The performance of this resistor is crucial for the accuracy, temperature behaviour, settling time and long-term drift of the DCCT.

40|$|A {{current-carrying}} conductor {{is surrounded by}} a pair of ring cores. A sense winding on one core provides flux rate feedback to a power amplifier which drives the ampere-turn compensating current through a common compensating winding. The other core serves as a second- harmonic modulator to establish zero-flux operation and thus to ensure a perfect, temperature-independent current balance. A specially- developed <b>burden</b> <b>resistor</b> converts the compensating current into a voltage signal, which is amplified to give an 10 V output signal at the nominal value of the current to be measured. A substantial number of devices, ranging from 50 to 25000 Amperes is now operational in the beam transfer and extraction power supplies to the CERN SPS. (4 refs) ...|$|E
