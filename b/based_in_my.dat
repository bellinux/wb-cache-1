This paper compares the effectiveness of default prediction using two different types of measures: accounting and market based.

Theory goes as far to say that accounting measures can add no incremental value to a market <b>based</b> measure. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> research I found that accounting based measures can be effective in their predictive power; the market-based measure (BSM) results were much more difficult to estimate within the limits of this research project...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on the organization surrounding the school transports in Norrköping and its surrounding areas. It is a qualitative research {{based on interviews with}} four different groups that is included by this organization, local municipal officials, entrepreneurs, school personnel and youths depending on this service. I have used organization theory as a theoretical <b>base.</b> <b>In</b> <b>my</b> study it became clear to me that this is a complex and multifarious organization. The many different actors sometimes make it hard to survey all the different parts of the organization. The local municipal officials are responsible for the planning of school transports but are dependent on the cooperation of the other actors. The school transports are vital for the countryside and makes it possible for people to live far out on the country without having to pay for the transports to school. Furthermore it creates jobs for the local entrepreneur. My analysis shows that the main problem in the organization is the lack of communication and the different opinions in some areas of the organization. A lack of understanding and communication creates problems for an organization of this magnitude {{and it needs to be}} recognized. One solution is to organize meetings with the people involved at regular intervals. It is easier to discuss a matter if you meet each other face to face...|$|R

40|$|I {{have written}} an essay called ”All {{children}} are equally worth - A qualitative analysis of how children are produced in KappAhls commercials”. The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to do {{a study of the}} swedish clothing company KappAhl’s commercials. My purpose is divided into three questions: With which clothing colours are girls and boys represented in the commercials? Is there any difference in the making of ”non-white” and ”white” children in the commercials? and What is being transmitted in KappAhl’s commercials, where the focus should lay on the clothes? My material consists of three selected video clips from KappAhl’s Youtube channel. The three commercials are named: 1, Back to school, 2, Children’s christmas and 3, KappAhl 3 för 2 på alla överdelar för barn (translation: KappAhl 3 for 2 on all children’s tops). I have chosen to use photo interpretation with denotation and connotation as the main tools and also qualitative analysis as methods <b>in</b> <b>my</b> review of the material. The main theoretical <b>base</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> thesis is gender theory, while, for instance, stereotypes, binary oppositions and ethnicity are concepts chosen in hope to reach a deeper analytical level. I have also analyzed these commercials through the colours on the children’s clothes, the way the children are dressed and the settings around them. Through the analysis I {{have come to the conclusion}} that the children are dressed quite alike, in similar colors. But the girls are often dressed in colors that we find ”neutral” on girls, but if the boys would wear the colors that we find "neutral" on girls, we would see them as boyish. The boys would never wear colours that would seem ”neutral” on them, but in the general eye of society these colours would be seen as girl colors. The biggest difference I found in the commercials between ”non-white” and ”white” was that the ”white” younger boys were mystified through hats and hooded sweatshirts, and the ”non-white” boy, and the ”non-white” grown-up men were all themself with no assecceories trying to mystify them...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the late}} nineteenth century, {{contingency}} has been dealt with in an ideologically oppositional fashion. Though scrupulously avoided by the notorious doctrine of'process management', contingency was valued in the emerging realm of photography for its ontological connection to the present. 1 Long after early photography made a virtue of capturing contingency on film, the experiments ofland and site-specific art in the 196 os and 1970 s sought to figure it sculpturally, using the existing contextual, material and spatial aspects of a site to inform their responses. The following exegesis seeks to explore the aesthetics of contingency: the unavoidable and potentially unmanageable presence of multiple potentialities that both shape and interrupt our relationship to place, and open up new spaces for reflection and inquiry. This exegesis serves as a reflective inventory and travelogue that traces both theoretical and practice- <b>based</b> explorations <b>in</b> <b>my</b> studio {{over the course of}} one year...|$|R
