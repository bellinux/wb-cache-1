50|$|Inertial {{motion capture}} {{technology}} {{is based on}} miniature inertial sensors, biomechanical models and sensor fusion algorithms. The motion data of the inertial sensors (inertial guidance system) is often transmitted wirelessly to a computer, where the motion is recorded or viewed. Most inertial systems use inertial measurement units (IMUs) containing a combination of gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer, to measure rotational rates. These rotations are translated to a skeleton in the software. Much like optical markers, the more IMU sensors the more natural the data. No external cameras, emitters or markers are needed for relative motions, although {{they are required to}} give the absolute position of the user if desired. Inertial motion capture systems capture the full six degrees of freedom body motion of a human in real-time and can give limited direction information if they include a magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>sensor,</b> although these are much lower resolution and susceptible to electromagnetic noise. Benefits of using Inertial systems include: capturing in a variety of environments including tight spaces, no solving, portability, and large capture areas. Disadvantages include lower positional accuracy and positional drift which can compound over time. These systems are similar to the Wii controllers but are more sensitive and have greater resolution and update rates. They can accurately measure the direction to the ground to within a degree. The popularity of inertial systems is rising amongst independent game developers, mainly because of the quick and easy set up resulting in a fast pipeline. A range of suits are now available from various manufacturers and base prices range from $1,000 to $80,000 USD.|$|E

Our cost formulation explicitly models time spent in traveling as well as taking measurements. Further, the robots are subject to distance-based communication constraints. We first study properties of an optimal strategy which has access to the target’s true location. It turns out that under certain circumstances, the optimal algorithm will break communication to take measurements and rendezvous to merge them. Using these insights, we design an online strategy (which does not have access to the target’s true location) and show that the strategy can locate the target up to a desired uncertainty level at near-optimal cost. The results are applicable to other <b>bearing</b> <b>sensors</b> with non-zero measurement cost, such as pantilt cameras.

The challenges in this context lie in {{an unknown number of}} objects, false alarms and clutter measurements. To avoid the time consuming data association and data storage, an iterative approach, which only considers the sensor data from the actual timestep for an update of every object state, is preferable. Our approach to perform this is a Monte Carlo realization of a probability hypothesis density filter. In this context we use bearing data gained from an antenna or optical camera mounted on an airborne observer.

Our main result is a proof that except for pathological cases, any point is reachable from any other point by reflex action in the <b>bearing</b> <b>sensor</b> space provided the environment is free of obstacles. Although the robot’s trajectory generated by this method does not necessarily correspond to the shortest path on the ground, this approach constitutes a practical solution to a basic navigation problem for autonomous mobile robots...|$|E

The proposed algorithm integrates low precision global sensors, like GPS and compasses, with more precise relative position (i. e., range plus <b>bearing)</b> <b>sensors.</b> Global sensors are used to reconstruct the absolute position and orientation, while relative sensors are used to retrieve {{the shape of the}} formation. A fast distributed and asynchronous linear least-squares algorithm is proposed to solve an approximated version of the non-linear Maximum Likelihood problem.

The use of ACK-less broadcast-based communication protocols ensures an efficient and easy implementation in real world scenarios. If the relative measurement errors are sufficiently small, we show that the algorithm attains a solution which is very close to the maximum likelihood solution. The theoretical findings and the algorithm performances are extensively tested by means of Monte-Carlo simulations. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The neural {{representation}} {{of space in}} rats has inspired many navigation systems for robots. In particular, Self-Organizing (Feature) Maps (SOM) are often used to {{give a sense of}} location to robots by mapping sensor information to a low-dimensional grid. For example, a robot equipped with a panoramic camera can build a 2 D SOM from vectors of landmark bearings. If there are four landmarks in the robot’s environment, then the 2 D SOM is embedded in a 2 D manifold lying in a 4 D space. In general, the set of observable sensor vectors form a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold in a high-dimensional space. In a landmark <b>bearing</b> <b>sensor</b> space, the manifold can have a large curvature in some regions (when the robot is near a landmark for example), making the Eulidian distance a very poor approximation of the Riemannian metric. In this paper, we present and compare three methods for measuring the similarity between vectors of landmark bearings. We also discuss a method to equip SOM with a good approximation of the Riemannian metric. Although we illustrate the techniques with a landmark bearing problem, our approach is applicable to other types of data sets. ...|$|E

Unlike range sensors which provide range and angular information, a <b>bearing</b> <b>sensor</b> (e. g. cameras) measures only the bearing (angular information) of features.
