5|$|Vehicles play a {{prominent}} role in the game, replacing the moves and transformations featured in its predecessors. The vehicles can be built freely by the player from over 1600 different components available, such as body panels, engines, wheels, wings, propellers, fuel tanks and weapons. Vehicles range from automobiles, motorbikes, boats and aeroplanes. In order to create vehicles, the player must collect vehicle parts and bluepints which are scattered throughout the hub world, or can be earned after winning specific challenges. The player may also purchase preset <b>blueprints</b> and vehicle parts from Humba Wumba in Showdown Town. In addition, players can also send and receive <b>blueprints</b> over Xbox Live.|$|E

It was written by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, and went into detail about the conception of the planned and later aborted series, looking at several aspects of production, with behind-the-series information, color artwork, storyboards, <b>blueprints,</b> technical information and photos. It also contained two full scripts from the planned series.|$|E
50|$|A {{software}} <b>blueprint</b> is {{the final}} product of a software <b>blueprinting</b> process. Its name derives from an analogy with the term <b>blueprint</b> as used within the traditional construction industry. Therefore, a true software <b>blueprint</b> should share {{a number of key}} properties with its building-blueprint counterpart. Software <b>blueprinting</b> relies on achieving a clean separation between logically orthogonal aspects of the software. Once that is achieved, it facilitates the localization of related logic and use of an optimal description medium for each of the logically independent components (for each <b>blueprint).</b>|$|R
40|$|Information-intensive service (IIS) {{is a type}} {{of service}} in which {{information}} interactions have the most effect on service value creation. Recent innovations of information and communication technology have created various types of IISs, and the literature argues that IIS should be a research priority in this information economy. This research proposes a new service <b>blueprinting</b> framework specialized to IISs, called the Information Service <b>Blueprint.</b> The framework user can succinctly capture the big-picture and key points of the complex IIS process in question by <b>blueprinting</b> an IIS. The Information Service <b>Blueprint</b> has served as a basis for <b>blueprinting</b> IISs in IIS design projects with industry and government. An experiment to compare the Information Service <b>Blueprint</b> with the conventional service <b>blueprint</b> also confirms its utility for <b>blueprinting</b> IISs.

5|$|Rocksteady {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a sequel before development of Arkham Asylum had concluded, developing ideas for both the story and setting so the games' narratives could be effectively connected; a secret room was hidden in the asylum warden's office in Arkham Asylum containing hints of how the sequel would progress, including <b>blueprints</b> for the Arkham City prison; the <b>blueprints</b> are quite similar to its final layout in Arkham City. The original idea was to take the game out of the asylum setting and onto the streets of Gotham City while retaining the level of design detail put into the asylum. To that end they wanted to include locations from the Batman mythos that were notable and meaningful to the character, instead of a series of generic streets; Rocksteady was initially unsure how technical considerations would limit the scope of this idea.|$|E
5|$|The game retains some {{platforming}} traits; {{the player}} may disembark {{from a vehicle}} and explore the environment {{in a manner similar}} to that of the previous games. On foot the duo can grab ledges, swim underwater, balance on tightropes and perform basic jumps. Kazooie's spanner can also be used as a melee weapon outside of the vehicle, in addition to levitating lopsided vehicles. Banjo and Kazooie have limited attack power and agility on foot at first, but the duo can upgrade their speed, stamina and strength by visiting Boggy's gym in the game's hub world. Scattered around the game's six worlds are musical notes, which serve as currency for the player to purchase certain items such as <b>blueprints,</b> parts, and access to advanced vehicles. Musical notes vary in value as determined by its colour; gold, silver or bronze. Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts also features an online multiplayer; players can compete in challenges such as races and combat over Xbox Live. In addition, players can share their own vehicle designs and <b>blueprints</b> online.|$|E

Having learned of the threat, Mega Man's rival Bass decides to take matters into his own hands. The game is an action-platformer where the player advances by defeating bosses and acquiring their signature weapons. Mega Man & Bass lets the player choose between either of its title characters, each of which plays differently from the other.|$|E

The name of the railroad, Carolwood Pacific Railroad, came from his home's location on Carolwood Drive. The miniature working steam locomotive was built by Disney Studios engineer Roger E.
