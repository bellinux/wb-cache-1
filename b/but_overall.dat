5|$|North American {{predators and}} parasitoids can {{occasionally}} cause high emerald ash borer mortality, but generally offer only limited control. Mortality due to native woodpeckers is variable. Parasitism by parasitoids such as Atanycolus cappaerti can be high, <b>but</b> <b>overall</b> such control is generally low.|$|E

5|$|A {{circular}} permutation is {{a relationship}} between proteins whereby the proteins have a changed order of amino acids in their peptide sequence. The result is a protein structure with different connectivity, <b>but</b> <b>overall</b> similar three-dimensional (3D) shape. In 1979, the first pair of circularly permuted proteins – concanavalin A and lectin – were discovered; over 2000 such proteins are now known.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the capitulation, Imperos hull was 88% {{complete}} and the engines were 76% complete, <b>but</b> <b>overall</b> the ship was only 28% complete; it would have required about eighteen more months of full work to be finished. Key features like the armament, electrical wiring and a reworking of the bridge had still not been completed.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{spent most}} of the next year on his farm, and went back to work only when Edward L. Alperson from Grand National Films, a newly established, {{independent}} studio, approached him to make movies for $100,000 a film and 10% of the profits. Cagney made two films for Grand National: Great Guy and Something to Sing About. He received good reviews for both, <b>but</b> <b>overall</b> the production quality was not up to Warner Bros. standards, and the films did not do well. A third film, Dynamite, was planned, but Grand National ran out of money.|$|E

5|$|Donnchadh's {{career is}} not well {{documented}} in the surviving sources. Charters provide a little information about some of his activities, <b>but</b> <b>overall</b> their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called cartularies) from the Gaelic south-west have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east. Principally, the relevant charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned {{in the body of}} these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.|$|E
5|$|Ground {{temperature}} measurements, {{like most}} weather observations, are logged by location. Their siting predates the massive sprawl, roadbuilding programs, and high- and medium-rise expansions which {{contribute to the}} UHI. More importantly, station logs allow sites in question to be filtered easily from data sets. Doing so, the presence of heat islands is visible, <b>but</b> <b>overall</b> trends change in magnitude, not direction.|$|E
5|$|Radirgy was ported in 2006 to the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, and GameCube {{exclusively}} in Japan—of which {{the latter two}} featured exclusive gameplay modes. O~3 Entertainment planned to localize the GameCube version in North America under the title Radio Allergy, but the release was canceled. The game was later localized for the Wii in a compilation of MileStone shooters, Ultimate Shooting Collection. Critics found the game challenging and unique, <b>but</b> <b>overall</b> an average experimental shooter. Radirgy has been followed by two titles, Radirgy Noa and Radirgy De Gojaru.|$|E

5|$|Some Anglo-Saxon kings {{are known}} to have been killed by their {{households}} or in open warfare against rivals, <b>but</b> <b>overall</b> the record is very sparse. The evidence as regards the deposition of kings is equally limited. Only two eighth-century depositions offer any context, those of Æthelwald Moll in Northumbria and Sigeberht of Wessex. In both cases the decision is presented as that of some form of council.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} may be hunted by birds of prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or {{act as an}} {{involuntary}} host to the common cuckoo, <b>but</b> <b>overall</b> its population is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|All of the wharves {{along the}} coast of Mississippi were {{reportedly}} ruined. In Mobile, Alabama, the storm uprooted trees and damaged several buildings, including a church. Tides rose several feet above normal, flooding low-lying streets such that fishermen were able to deliver their catches directly to market by boat. Some businesses sustained minor water damage, <b>but</b> <b>overall,</b> the city was spared any significant destruction, and received little impact on shipping. To the east, there were unconfirmed reports of significant damage to wharves and warehouses along the Florida Panhandle, but these accounts may have been exaggerated by rival companies.|$|E

5|$|As a disorganized {{tropical}} cyclone {{in the northeastern}} Caribbean, Rafael produced major flooding across the region. As much as a foot of rain fell across portions of the Lesser Antilles, causing mudslides, landslides, and river flooding. In addition, the heavy rains led to significant crop loss. Sustained winds near hurricane force were recorded on Saint Martin, while tropical storm-force gusts occurred widespread. Lightning activity {{as a result of}} heavy thunderstorms caused many fires and power outages. One fatality occurred when a woman in Guadeloupe unsuccessfully attempted to drive her car across a flooded roadway. As Rafael passed just to the east of Bermuda as a hurricane, light rainfall was recorded. Gusts over 50mph (85km/h) left hundreds of houses without electricity. Large swells from the system caused significant damage to the coastline of Nova Scotia, while many roads were washed away or obscured with debris, <b>but</b> <b>overall,</b> damage was minimal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of the storm, several of the main roads in New Orleans were shut down due to flooding. At least 100 homes were flooded by the storm. In Baton Rouge, dozens of people were {{evacuated}} from a flooded home via ambulance and wagon to safer areas. In nearby Mississippi, rainfall from the storm was mainly confined to the southeastern counties; however, significant accumulations, peaking at , were recorded. Rain from the remnant low spread into Georgia. Some stream flooding and crop damage were reported <b>but</b> <b>overall,</b> the damage was minor. In all, Arlene caused $500,000 ($3.7million 2010 USD) in damage. One death was related to Arlene; a man drowned in rough surf off the Galveston coast. After the initial low dissipated over the southeastern United States, the extratropical remnants of Arlene brought moderate rainfall to parts of the Mid-Atlantic States and New England.|$|E
5|$|Local {{officials}} in Allegan have proposed {{creation of a}} truck route around the town. Concerned about the traffic and noise, residents have formed the Citizens for a Safer Community. They cite reports that show that the accident rates in town are higher than the statewide average. The group and local officials are proposing using 24th Street, 118th Avenue and Babylon Road for truck traffic. MDOT would require permits to erect the signs needed for the truck route. The department has indicated that the bypass {{would not be a}} state highway. MDOT will not take ownership of the roads needed for the truck route, <b>but</b> <b>overall</b> the department is supportive of the city's efforts to make the downtown area more pedestrian friendly.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{knowledge}} of Egyptian {{beliefs about the}} gods is mostly drawn from religious writings produced by the nation's scribes and priests. These people were the elite of Egyptian society and were very distinct from the general populace, {{most of whom were}} illiterate. Little is known about how well this broader population knew or understood the sophisticated ideas that the elite developed. Commoners' perceptions of the divine may have differed from those of the priests. The populace may, for example, have mistaken the religion's symbolic statements about the gods and their actions for literal truth. <b>But</b> <b>overall,</b> what little is known about popular religious belief is consistent with the elite tradition. The two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of the gods and their nature.|$|E
5|$|Morphological {{studies have}} been {{inconclusive}} about the evolutionary relationships of the tasselled wobbegong, <b>but</b> <b>overall</b> have gauged it {{to be among the}} more derived wobbegong (Orectolobidae) species. A 2009 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found otherwise, that this species was in fact basal to all other wobbegongs except the northern wobbegong (O. wardi). This result supports the synonymization of Eucrossorhinus with Orectolobus. Molecular clock estimation placed the speciation of the tasselled wobbegong at 11–6 Ma, coinciding with a period of significant geological rearrangement and the formation of coral reef habitats in the region.|$|E
5|$|Murray Robson {{replaced}} Treatt as Leader of the Opposition in August 1954. Like {{other senior}} members of the Liberals, after having no conservative government since Alexander Mair in 1941, Robson had no experience in government, he had little interest in policy except for Cold War anti-communism, ignored majority views of his party and fellow parliamentary colleagues and Robson's attempts to forge a closer alliance with Bruxner and the Country Party, failed dismally and alienated him from many in his party. Robson was replaced by Pat Morton as leader in September 1955. Bruxner, now aged 70 and having fallen ill several times, led the Country Party one last time at the March 1956 election, which resulted in another labour victory and Country Party regained the seat of Armidale, <b>but</b> <b>overall</b> the government's majority fell from twenty to six. Bruxner retained Tenterfield unopposed.|$|E
