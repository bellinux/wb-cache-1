Coke reactivity and strength are closely related, as such, an improved understanding of the kinetics of <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>coke</b> reactions {{can be used to}} enhance blast furnace performance. However, coke is a complex composite material, with an inherent heterogeneity with respect to oxide phase composition and phase dispersion. The complexity and heterogeneity of coke makes it difficult to isolate the effects of a specific component on coke reactivity. The coke analogue has been developed to address these issues and was used for controlled testing of specific mineral, and to some degree maceral, effects on reactivity. The reaction of coke analogue with CO 2 was studied using thermogravimetric analysis to measure the kinetics at temperatures from 850 to 1350 °C. The reaction rate behaviour of the analogue is similar to that reported for industrial coke. The gasification rate increased with increasing temperature and three reaction zones corresponding to different kinetic control regimes, as found in industrial coke, have been identified. These findings show that the coke analogue demonstrates similar reaction kinetics to industrial coke indicating its suitability for use in coke kinetic studies...|$|E

The analysis of changes in chemical composition of coke due to impact of inert gas and air at different temperatures was made. The impact of the application of the thermoabrasion coefficient on the porosity of coke was also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: By applying the Computer Thermochemical Database of the TERMO system (REAKTOR 1 and REAKTOR 3) three groups of substances can be distinguished. The chemical composition of <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>coke</b> and the results of calculations of changes of chemical composition of coke heat treated under certain conditions were compared.

Practical implications: Thanks to the thermochemical calculations it is possible to predict ash composition after the treatment in a blast furnace.

40|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of advancing prices for <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>coke</b> and primary energy carriers based on fossil fuels the ironmaking industry tries to utilize secondary raw materials to the maximum feasible extent. In Germany among others plastic granulate material produced from recycled sales packaging that arises from the “Green Dot” system, {{is used as a}} substitute reducing agent and energy source. Up to particle sizes of 10 mm the material can be injected into the blast furnace via the tuyères by using a pneumatic conveying system and by means of several injection lances. Although the physical and chemical parameters of the applied recycling products are specified in principle there can be deviations resulting from inefficient material processing. Particularly with regard to particle size individual lots can contain a higher amount of fine and fibrous particles that build up fluff agglomerates when being agitated as it is the case during pneumatic conveying and injection, in consequence of which the pipes and filters of the system are choked. The occurrence of fluff therefore requires additional treatment of the material. At the Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering & Solids Processing of the Technical University of Berlin the dry separation of the fluff material fraction has been systematically investigated in the framework of a cooperation project with ironmaking industry. The paper presents results from bench scale tests using a laboratory zigzag sifter. The analysis of separation efficiency with respect to finding the optimal process parameters in terms of volumetric air flow rate and solids throughput comprised the evaluation of material recovery and grade efficiency curves.

30|$|Coke is {{produced}} by heating finely crushed coal charge in air tight coke ovens. The coal charge mostly consists of blends of different coking coals {{and in some cases}} also partially briquetted charge coal. After carbonization, the coke is pushed from the ovens and quenched with water/inert gas (dry quenching). This hard and porous carbonaceous product acts mainly as a source of reductant for the reduction of iron ore, provides thermal energy and provides a permeable support for the burden materials in the blast furnace. Although coke is expensive, it is still indispensable for the production of liquid iron through Blast Furnace (BF) route. The Major functions of coke in BF are to provide heat for different endothermic reactions inside the BF and for melting of slag and metal, reducing gases required for the reduction of iron oxides, support and permeable bed during counter current flow of materials and gases in BF. Coke is the only solid material in the furnace that supports the iron bearing burden and provides a permeable bed necessary for slag and metal to pass down into the hearth and for hot gases to pass upwards in BF. Of the above mentioned three roles of BF coke, the first two can be substituted by oil, gas, plastics and non-coking coals. These are injected through tuyeres to generate heat and reducing gases. Such a substitution brings reduction in coke rates for the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> (<b>coke</b> rate is the weight of coke required to produce one tonne of hot metal). However, there is no other satisfactory material available, which can replace, fully or partially, metallurgical coke as a permeable support of blast furnace charge materials (burden). Over the last few decades, coke quality requirements have become more stringent due to development of large capacity blast furnaces (>[*] 3500  m 3) and high pulverized coal injection (PCI)/coal dust injection (CDI) rates.|$|E
