5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered {{to increase the}} amount of light emitted. The four-wick <b>burner</b> and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass <b>burner</b> with eight wicks and an improved lantern; the power of the light was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick <b>burner</b> was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle <b>burner</b> in 1905. In 1923, the <b>burner</b> was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour <b>burner</b> with one mantle.|$|E
5|$|Repairs and {{alterations}} {{were made}} to the lighthouse in 1863-64 by engineer Henry Norris, when the single-wick lamp was replaced with a Chance Brothers four-wick <b>burner,</b> as well as a new lens. The improvements included a red arc of light over the hazardous Pearl Rock region. An additional upgrade was made in 1875 when the lamp was switched out for a four-wick mineral oil <b>burner.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{snow melting}} vehicle works by {{scooping}} snow into a melting pit {{located in a}} large tank {{at the rear of}} the vehicle. Around the melting pit is a thin jacket full of warm water, heated by a powerful <b>burner.</b> The gases from the <b>burner</b> are bubbled through the water, causing some of the heated water to spill over into the melting pit, melting the snow instantly. The meltwater is discharged into the storm drains.|$|E

In addition, <b>burners</b> have a wider range of regulation vis-à-vis fuel than heat engines [4].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} heat {{transfer}} aspects of surface radiation <b>burners,</b> {{which are not}} less interesting than the environmental ones. Development of surface radiating fiber <b>burners</b> began some years ago in Hungary in frame of steps in order to decrease air pollution by highly toxic NOx emission from different combustion equipment. NOx emission from surface radiating fiber <b>burners</b> is about 65 % less than of conventional <b>burners.</b> Other benefit of surface radiating fiber <b>burners</b> is their uniform temperature distribution. This gives possibility to avoid local overload of flame tube boilers. ...|$|R
5|$|Europa Lighthouse {{was inaugurated}} on 1 August 1841 {{in a brief}} {{ceremony}} witnessed by about 10,000 people. The first upgrade of the lighthouse occurred in 1864, when the single-wick lamp was replaced with a Chance Brothers four-wick <b>burner,</b> with further changes in 1875 and in 1894 when the amount of light emitted was increased. A three incandescent mantle <b>burner</b> was added in 1905. Following further modernisation in the 20th century, the lighthouse was fully automated in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Gimbal: The gimbal {{is known}} as the 'Cardan' {{suspension}} after Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576), yet it was known long before him. The British scientist Joseph Needham writes that the earliest confirmed use of gimbals in Europe is the 9th century recipe book Little Key of Painting and Belgian chemist and historian of science Mappae clavicula, which mentioned a vase surrounded by rings which allowed it to be undisturbed when in a rolling motion. Needham and BGeorge Sarton both write that an Arabic translation—dated to roughly the era of Al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833)—of an ancient Greek work now lost (i.e. Pneumatica) by 3rd-century BC Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (c. 280– c. 220 BC) contains a description of gimbals used to support an inkpot that could wet a pen on any of its sides, yet Needham suspects Arabic interpolation and doubts total authenticity, while Sarton asserts {{that for the most part}} the Arabic translation is faithful to Philo's lost original, hence Philo should be credited with the invention of the gimbal. Around 180 AD, the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) inventor and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (丁緩) — who also created a rotary fan and zoetrope lamp—invented a 'Perfume <b>Burner</b> for use among Cushions', or 'Bedclothes Censer'. This incense <b>burner</b> had a series of metal rings which could be moved in any direction while the <b>burner</b> in the middle remained constantly level. This is the first clear reference in China of the gimbal, although there is a hint in the writing of Sima Xiangru (179–117 BC) that this device existed in the 2nd century BC (i.e., 'the metal rings burning perfume'). The gimbal incense <b>burner</b> is mentioned in subsequent dynasties, while silverwork specimens of gimbal incense burners from the Tang Dynasty (618–907) still exist. In the Liang Dynasty (502–557) there is mention of gimbals used in hinges for doors and windows, while an unnamed artisan presented a warming stove to Empress Wu Zetian (r. 690–705) in 692 which employed gimbals to keep it constantly balanced.|$|E
5|$|Officially {{displayed}} for {{the first}} time in 1903, the original vapourized kerosene <b>burner</b> was upgraded in 1923, electrified in 1961 and automated and demanned in 1994, after more than 90 years of being staffed. It celebrated its centenary in 2003.|$|E
5000|$|It is well {{established}} that conventional [...] "blue flame" [...] or bunsen gas <b>burners</b> produce oxides of nitrogen at levels of 30-50 nanograms per joule and are as such not considered to have potential for NOx reduction. Surface combustion <b>burners</b> or radiant tile <b>burners</b> in comparison produce nitrogen oxides' levels 60-70% less. Therefore John Joyce's research into low NOx <b>burners</b> revolved primarily around surface combustion techniques. Another issue was the effect combustion temperatures have on the formation of NOx.|$|R
50|$|Nitrogen oxide {{emissions}} are controlled in the combustion process {{by the use}} of low- NOx SOFA <b>burners.</b> Prior to 2009 when installation of the new <b>burners</b> began, NOx emissions were about 34,000 tons per year.

5|$|Because {{they have}} to carry the large water tank and fuel for the <b>burner,</b> snow melting {{machines}} tend to be much larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around , with the largest being hauled by semi-trailer tractor units. In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plow or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 metric tons of snow per hour, compared to the 5,000 metric tons per hour capacity of any large snow blower.|$|E

5|$|Hannibal {{served with}} the Channel Fleet (later reorganised to the Atlantic Fleet) after {{commissioning}} in 1898. In 1906 she underwent a refit, which included a conversion from a coal <b>burner</b> to using oil. She was placed in reserve from 1907, only to be mobilised in July 1914 as a precautionary measure prior to the outbreak of World War I. From August 1914 to February 1915 Hannibal was a guard ship at Scapa Flow. Later that year, her main armament was removed and she was converted to a troopship, serving in this capacity during the Dardanelles campaign. From November 1915 {{to the end of}} the war, she served as a depot ship based in Alexandria, Egypt. She was disposed of in 1920 and scrapped later that year.|$|E
5|$|As {{the files}} {{converge}} {{on the east}} frieze we encounter the first women celebrants E2–27, E50–51, E53–63.

The next groups E18–23, E43–46, are problematic. Six on the left and four on the right, if one does not count two other figures who may or may not be marshals, then this group might be taken to be the ten eponymous heroes who gave their names to the ten tribes. Their proximity to the deities indicates their importance, but selecting differently, then nine of them may be the archons of the polis or athlothetai officials who managed the procession; there is insufficient iconographic evidence to determine which interpretation is correct.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{with the}} {{production}} beginning to coalesce, Scorsese and a production crew went to Nagasaki, Japan, visiting the original sites {{that served as the}} setting for Endō's novel. Additional location scouting was conducted in Canada. However, Silence entered a state of development hell soon afterwards, and Scorsese decided to work on Shutter Island and Hugo instead. In December 2011, Scorsese stated that Silence would be his next film. By March, although he originally put it on the back <b>burner</b> and consequently dropped out, Scorsese signed back on to The Wolf of Wall Street and opted to direct it ahead of Silence. However, at the time, Scorsese's publicist stated that Silence would come first. In May, the film picked up another producer in the recently revived Cecchi Gori Pictures, which placed the project first on its slate of upcoming films. Cecchi Gori was involved in pre-production for Silence, but years of unrelated legal disputes had interrupted its association to the film.|$|E

5|$|The Southern Railway {{operating}} department undertook trials to improve fleet efficiency. When built, Eastbourne-based No. A629 was fitted with an experimental pulverised fuel <b>burner</b> of German design; {{the experiment was}} terminated when a minor explosion {{was caused by the}} powdered coal coming into contact with sparks thrown from the blastpipe. The experiment also proved that pulverised coal was a false economy, as much of the fine dust was sucked through the chimney without combustion taking place. The locomotive was returned to normal coal burning in 1935. In 1947 the class became a test-bed for a government-backed scheme regarding fuelling arrangements in anticipation of a coal shortage. Two of the class, Nos. 1625 and 1797, were converted to oil burning, with more set to follow suit; but the project was abandoned and the two oil burners were reverted to coal-firing before this could take place.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} first hinted by an Atlus {{spokesperson}} in November 1999, who stated that Atlus was planning an {{entry in the}} Megami Tensei franchise for the platform. The game was eventually announced in September 2002 by the gaming magazine Famitsu, where it was clarified it was a sequel to previous Shin Megami Tensei games rather than an entry in the spin-off Persona series. Atlus had high hopes for Nocturnes success, preparing estimated shipments totaling 500,000 units. The game launched on February 20, 2003. It came in a standard edition, and a limited special edition containing the game's soundtrack and an insence <b>burner</b> modeled after an in-game story component. In addition, a version exclusive to Japanese media retail shop Tsutaya with a unique cover was released. It was later re-released as part of Sony's budget series release on August 5, 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} the game is Kratos (voiced by Terrence C. Carson), a Spartan warrior who serves the Olympian Gods. Other {{characters}} include a host of Greek gods, such as Athena (Carole Ruggier), the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' ally and mentor; Ares (Steven Blum), the God of War and main antagonist; Poseidon (Fred Tatasciore), the God of the Sea; Aphrodite (Carole Ruggier), the Goddess of Love and Sexuality; Zeus (Paul Eiding), the King of the Gods; Artemis (Claudia Black), the Goddess of the Hunt; and Hades (Nolan North), the God of the Underworld. Several of the gods aid Kratos with magic or weapons. Minor characters include the Oracle of Athens (Susan Blakeslee), the gravedigger (Paul Eiding), the body <b>burner</b> (Christopher Corey Smith), and the boat captain (Keith Ferguson). Other characters appear in flashbacks, including Kratos' wife Lysandra (Gwendoline Yeo), his daughter Calliope, the Barbarian King, and a Village Oracle (Susan Blakeslee).
