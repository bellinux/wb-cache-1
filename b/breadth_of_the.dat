5|$|Filming {{started in}} August 2006 at the Wikimania 2006 conference, and by April 2007 {{the team had}} {{aggregated}} 100 hours of footage. Co-director Hill accompanied Wales during 2007, filming him as he journeyed around the globe. Hill took a two-person film crew and traveled to China, Indonesia, India, South Africa, Australia and Europe, interviewing editors and contributors. Hill is himself an editor of Wikipedia, starting an article about a graffiti artist. Gibson and Hill required expertise in the creative and funding aspects of film-making and invited Scott Glosserman to join the venture. Glosserman's involvement with the film began during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. After Glosserman signed on, the <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endeavor became larger.

5|$|This line — {{with many}} non-hamburger sandwiches, {{including}} chicken and fish — significantly expanded the <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Burger King menu. The amount of new additions, several new sandwiches made with disparate ingredients {{was made possible}} due the design of Burger King's kitchen. The chain's kitchen is modeled around a more flexible concept that allows for a multiple work-flow operations where preparation stations can be re-tasked more easily. In comparison, McDonald's kitchen {{at the time was}} a more rigidly designed assembly line concept intended to quickly produce a more uniform product and was not easily adapted to new products. This more rigid system prevented McDonald's from broadening its menu to effectively competing with Burger King and other similar chains that were more flexible and were better positioned to expand their menu.|$|E

5|$|The costliest war in U.S. {{history in}} terms of American life, this war {{has been the subject}} of, or the {{backdrop}} to, numerous films, documentaries and mini-series. One of the earliest films using the Civil War as its subject was D.W. Griffith's 1910 silent picture, The Fugitive. Films that have the war as its main subject, or about a certain aspect of the war include the 1989 film, Glory, about the first formal unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War to be made up entirely of black men. Some films such as Gettysburg focused on a single battle during the war, or even on a single incident, like the French short film, La Rivière du Hibou (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge). Others like the 1993 miniseries North and South spanned the entire <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. Some films deal with the human aspects of the war, such as The Red Badge of Courage (1951), or Shenandoah (1965), on the tragedy that the war inflicted on the civilian population.

Using all seven variables the procedure correctly assigned seks for 93, 75 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sample. This compares favorably with results achieved with other skeletal parts; it also compares favorably with results using the femur in sexing other population groups. Discriminant function analysis with only one variable, useful for sexing fragmentary remains, also produced good results. Maximum diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femoral head was the best seks discriminator with an accuracy of 91 %. Epicondylar breadth with and accuracy of 87, 5 % and maximum length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femur with an accuracy of 85 % are also useful for determining seks in poorly preserved remains.
