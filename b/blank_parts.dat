Lithography and offset lithography are planographic processes that rely on the property that water will not mix with oil. The image is created by applying a tusche (greasy substance) to a plate or stone. (The term lithography comes from litho, for stone, and -graph to draw.) Certain parts of the semi-absorbent surface being printed on can be made receptive to ink while others (the <b>blank</b> <b>parts)</b> reject it.|$|E

Three guide plate inserts with different V-ring positions and three die inserts with different die chamfers were machined, and then a fine blanking tool was manufactured for the fine blanking experiments. Nine experiments were conducted on a 650 -ton fine blanking press. Each die roll height was measured and analyzed. It would be noticed that the die roll heights on the corner shapes of the fine <b>blanked</b> <b>parts</b> increased with increasing V-ring distance and die chamfer angle, but it decreased with increasing corner radius and angle.

40|$|Since English {{expressions}} {{vary according}} to the genres, it is important for students to study questions that are generated from sentences of the target genre. Although various questions are prepared, it is still not enough to satisfy various genres which students want to learn. On the other hand, when producing English questions, sufficient grammatical knowledge and vocabulary are needed, so it is difficult for non-expert to prepare English questions by themselves. In this paper, we propose an automatic generation system of multiple-choice cloze questions from English texts. Empirical knowledge is necessary to produce appropriate questions, so machine learning is introduced to acquire knowledge from existing questions. To generate the questions from texts automatically, the system (1) extracts appropriate sentences for questions from texts based on Preference Learning, (2) estimates a <b>blank</b> <b>part</b> based on Conditional Random Field, and (3) generates distracters based on statistical patterns of existing questions. Experimental results show our method is workable for selecting appropriate sentences and <b>blank</b> <b>part.</b> Moreover, our method is appropriate to generate the available distracters, especially for the sentence that does not contain the proper noun...|$|R

40|$|With the {{significantly}} {{increasing demand}} {{on a large}} scale of miniaturized parts, the fabrication of micro-parts by directly using sheet metal is proven to be a promising and efficient micro-manufacturing process. In this process chain, shearing is used to pre-pierce hole or <b>blank</b> cylindrical <b>part.</b> In this research, the material deformation behavior and the fracture effect in shearing are extensively studied and it is revealed that they {{have a significant effect on}} the subsequent operations and the quality of the fabricated parts. In addition, the influence of forming conditions on deformation behavior, fractured surface quality and dimensional accuracy in shearing operation are systematically investigated. The interactive effects of multi-factors including grain size, lubricated condition and shear velocity on the quality of both the <b>blanked</b> <b>part</b> and the pierced hole are discussed. It is revealed that the forming quality deteriorates with the increase of grain size and shear velocity. High viscosity lubricant leads to low deformation load and small work hardening as well as good surface finish. The rag at the pierced hole edge and the surface breakages on the <b>blanked</b> <b>part</b> exist under high shear velocity, and the shear velocity should be controlled within a certain limit to balance the productivity and surface quality. Furthermore, the ultimate shear strength, billet diameter and burr height have the extreme values when the initial grain size equals to the punch-die clearance. Therefore, the deformation behavior and the product quality in micro shearing process is affected by the interactive effect of material state, die dimension, lubricated condition and shear velocity.

The key question is that the clamping robot automatively choices the best fit part by statistical result of geometric dimension of all parts. The best fit part is the one that its length and its diameter are mostly proximate to the processing requirement. This choice method can save staff, reduce working allowance, and lessen finished cost. According to the shape information and position information, the robot can confirm the grab order, grab angle and finger joint distance. Firstly, the part image is smoothing by noise reduction technology, secondly, the feature points are extracted. The feature points present the information of the location of the mass center, the dip angle and diameter. Finally, the clamping robot can grab the most fit bar part by means of rotational motion, rectilinear motion, and finger open-close movement when the shape information and location information of the bar part have been confirmed. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

Furthermore, it is also trying to discover the problems faced by the English teacher of 10 th grade students when giving assessment in reading class followed with how the teacher cope with the problems. This research was conducted using descriptive qualitative research methods. The data for this research was obtained by utilizing three instruments, namely; observation, interview, and document analysis.

Firstly, the teacher ordered the students to fill the <b>blank</b> <b>parts</b> with several provided vocabularies, or known as the cloze task.

40|$|Abstract. Blanking {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{manufacturing}} technologies in sheet metal processing, because nearly each sheet must be trimmed out of a semi-finished part or has to be blanked after a forming process to get the precast part in the manufacturing chain. In general, a high quantity of <b>blanked</b> <b>parts</b> should be manufactured without reworking the tool. Therefore a capable process is indispensable to avoid inadequate part quality or premature failure of the tool because of wear. The blanking process is affected by tool parameters, the press and the material properties of the <b>blanked</b> <b>part.</b> However, another important factor is the occurring temperature in the shearing zone of the sheet metal due to the dissipation of nearly 95 % of the plastic work during blanking and, in addition, frictional heating. This temperature impacts the blanking process features such as tool-wear and resulting cut edge quality. It has been presumed to be negligible by a lot of authors yet. In contrast some publications with experimental and analytical research assume that the temperature reaches values up to 1000 °C. Therefore, this report outlines a thermoelectric method to measure the resulting temperature distribution during the blanking process on the cutting edge of the blanking punch. The feasibility of the investigated measurement concept is shown on a concrete example...|$|R
