40|$|The early phase after {{hepatitis}} B virus infection {{could play}} a crucial role in clearance and/or persistence of the virus, particularly in neonates. This work compared the early phase of duck hepatitis B virus infection in 1 -day-old (D 1) and 28 -day-old (D 28) ducks to determine whether differences in viral or host innate immune response can be related to the difference in outcome. In the first phase, almost immediately after inoculation, virus was taken up by components of the reticulo-endothelial systems, particularly liver-specific macrophages, Kupffer cells. Very early after infection, the induction of alpha interferon by infected hepatocytes occurred and was rapidly reinforced by recruitment of effector lymphocytes, which directly or indirectly caused apoptosis, eliminating infected hepatocytes, as was seen in mature birds. In addition, a lack of lymphocytic infiltration of the liver was found in D 1 ducks, which supports the suggestion that the innate immune network is less effective in D 1 ducks. Taken together, these results suggest that failure of the co-ordinated innate immune response rather than a defect in induced antiviral cell-mediated immunity may be the key factor which makes <b>baby</b> <b>ducks</b> vulnerable to persistence of hepadnavirus infection. 12 page(s...|$|R

50|$|In {{order for}} the embryo to develop normally, it must {{be exposed to the}} heat in {{incubation}} for a correct period of time, while ensuring that the temperature is not too hot to harm the eggs or too cold to prevent growth. The embryo is very sensitive to high temperatures, and is killed easily upon cooking in sun or by boiling within the traditional production methods of balut. It appears that temperature has a huge impact on the final taste and texture of the cooked balut. Warm temperatures (29-30 °C) changes the taste and texture of the yolk, for example making it more grainy. This {{can be attributed to the}} changes in proteins (and partial denaturation of proteins) with the heating and incubation process. Physical and chemical changes in the final balut product can also be attributed to microbial infections and the rate that microbes can infect the balut at various stages. For example, while cooking and storing balut, it appears that at low temperatures (such as refrigeration) and high temperatures (29-30 °C) do not promote the growing of microbes as much as room temperature would. If microbes were to infect the balut, either during cooking or during storage, this can have consequences on the chemical changes of the product, possibly reducing its nutrient value, its texture, and its quality.Besides intentionally buying an egg with an embryo, most of the time, eggs are very closely monitored to not have any development of an embryo present (meaning they did not come into contact with a male duck and are not fertilized). Instead, with balut, consumers want an embryo and a fertilized <b>baby</b> <b>duck</b> egg to enjoy. While we can cook normal chicken eggs, without an embryo by boiling them, we can also cook balut by boiling. When boiling or cooking eggs, the white of the egg tends to solidify, as the proteins are denatured in an irreversible reaction and turn from a transparent color into white. This is why cooking balut takes a lot of skill, since it is a very rich source of protein, cooking it can easily denature the proteins and cause undesirable, irreversible reactions.|$|R

Many commercial raisers use gas brooders, but any type of good baby chick brooder may be used successfully. When using infrared brooders, allow one 250 -watt lamp per 25 goslings or 30 ducklings. With other types, you can determine the number of birds per hover by cutting the brooder's rated chick capacity by half for ducklings and by one-third for goslings.

R. anatipestifer infection characterized by infectious serositis, new <b>duck</b> <b>syndrome</b> in <b>duck</b> or exudative septicaemia, infectious influenza in geese. This disease causes acute or chronic contagious septicemic disease and accounts for major economic losses in industrialized duck forms due to weight loss. There {{has been little}} work on the molecular basis of the pathogenesis of this organism, and so far no virulence factors or drug resistance genes have been established. This study sixty-six strains of R. anatipestifer were isolated from ducks with infectious serositis and geese in Taiwan. All strains contain seven differently sized plasmids,and eighty-five percent of the ioslates(56 / 66) contained plasmids. In this study find the new plasmids, 7 -kb and 9 -kb plasmids in R. anatipestifer strains. The 7 -kb plasmid(designated as pY 1) and the 9 -kb plasmid(designated as pY 2) were completely sequenced {{to determine if they}} encoded virulence factors or drug resistance genes. pY 1 had 6849 bp and pY 2 had 8745 bp. Six ORFs(open reading frames) were identified in the pY 1 and eight ORFs were identified in the pY 2. There were a new ORF(ORF 651) in pY 1 and a new ORF(ORF 1233) in pY 2. The results indicated that ORF 651 was a plasmid-associated protein, and it was a water-soluble protein. After blasting ORF 651 with other proteins, indicated that ORF 651 has disaccharide hexapeptide lipid substrate binding site. There was no drug resistance gene in pY 1 and pY 2. Then designated PCR primers to amplify the drug resistance gene of R. anatipestifer genome. The results of PCR indicated that R. anatipestifer genome has encoded two types of dihydropeteroate synthase. This is the first report that R. anatipestifer genome encoded drug resistance gene, dihydropeteroate synthase. Compared the PCR results with antibiotic susceptibility test, there were 90. 3 ％ similarity. Thus, using the PCR method could be short the testing time of antibiotic susceptibility. 第一章 序言…………………………………………………… 1 第二章 文獻探討……………………………………………… 2 第一節Riemerella anatipestifer分類學簡介與生物學特性…… 2 第二節Riemerella anatipestifer 感染症……………… 4 第三節 細菌質體探討…………………………… 5 第四節 Riemerella anatipestifer抗藥性………………………………… 8 第三章 材料與方法………………………………………………………… 10 第一節Riemerella anatipestifer之分離…………………………… 10 第二節Riemerella anatipestifer之鑑定………………………………… 10 3 - 2. 1 聚合酶連鎖反應………………………………………………… [...] 10 3 - 2. 2 BIOLOG 96 項生化測定鑑定試驗……………………………… [...] 12 第三節 質體相分析………………………………………………………… 12 第四節 質體核酸序列定序分析…………………………………………… 13 3 - 4. 1 質體片段之分子選殖…………………………………………… [...] 13 3 - 4. 2 質體核酸片段定序與整合分析………………………………… [...] 14 第五節 重組質體蛋白之表現……………………………………………… 15 3 - 5. 1 重組表現載體之構築…………………………………………… [...] 15 3 - 5. 2 重組質體之表現與確認………………………………………… [...] 16 第六節 表現蛋白抗血清製備及RA質體蛋白檢測………………………. 18 3 - 6. 1 表現蛋白抗血清製備…………………………………………… [...] . 18 3 - 6. 2 應用Western blot檢測RA質體蛋白表現………………………. 19 第七節 藥物感受性試驗…………………………………………………… 20 3 - 7. 1 紙錠瓊脂擴散試驗……………………………………………… [...] 20 3 - 7. 2 微量培養液稀釋試驗…………………………………………… [...] 20 第八節 抗藥性基因偵測…………………………………………………… 21 3 - 8. 1 抗藥性基因引子之設計………………………………………… [...] 21 3 - 8. 2 PCR偵測RA抗藥性基因………………………………………… 21 第四章 結果……………………… [...] ……………………………………… 24 第一節Riemerella anatipestifer之分離與鑑定………………………… 24 4 - 1. 1 引子特異性分析………………………………………………… [...] 24 4 - 1. 2 分離鑑定結果……………………………………………………. 24 第二節 質體相分析………………………………………………………… 24 第三節 質體核酸序列定序分析…………………………………………… 25 4 - 3. 1 質體DNA內核酸限制酶圖譜分析……………………………… 25 4 - 3. 2 質體核酸序列分析……………………………………………… [...] 25 第四節 重組質體蛋白之表現……………………………………………… 26 4 - 4. 1 重組表現載體之構築…………………………………………… [...] 26 4 - 4. 2 重組質體之表現與純化………………………………………… [...] 26 第五節 應用Western blot檢測RA質體蛋白表現……………………… [...] 27 4 - 5. 1 RA菌株表現檢測…………………………………………………. 27 4 - 5. 2 RA-ORF 651 蛋白可溶及不可溶性檢測………………………… 27 第六節 藥物感受性試驗…………………………………………………… 27 4 - 6. 1 紙錠瓊脂擴散試驗……………………………………………… [...] 27 4 - 6. 2 微量培養液稀釋試驗…………………………………………… [...] . 28 第七節 抗藥性基因偵測…………………………………………………… 28 第五章 討論……………………………………………………………… 53 參考文獻……………………………………………………………………… 6...|$|R

The virus was reisolated from the affected ducks and replicated well in primary duck embryo fibroblasts and Vero cells, causing the cytopathic effect. The virus was identified as an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus with a size of approximately 55 nm in diameter. Genomic sequencing of the isolated virus revealed that it {{is closely related to}} Tembusu virus (a mosquito-borne Ntaya group flavivirus), with 87 – 91 % nucleotide identity of the partial E (envelope) proteins to that of Tembusu virus and 72 % of the entire genome coding sequence with Bagaza virus, the most closely related flavivirus with an entirely sequenced genome.
