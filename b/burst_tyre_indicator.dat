5000|$|... 15 June 1961: A Boeing 707 {{en route}} from Paris to Lima caught fire while landing at Lisbon Portela de Sacavém {{as a result of}} a <b>burst</b> <b>tyre.</b> Although only three out of 109 {{passengers}} were slightly injured and most of the baggage, cargo and mail was salvaged, hundreds of chickens on their way to a farm in Central America did not survive the accident.|$|R
50|$|A fourth {{victim of}} the gang's {{activities}} {{in the summer of}} 2014, 31 year old Albert Yusupov, was found dead along the a-108 motorway on 18 August 2014. He had managed to call a friend about his <b>burst</b> <b>tyre</b> hours before his body was found. The story attracted wide-spread attention in the media, as all victims were killed with 9mm bullets and their vehicles had been damaged by homemade caltrops.|$|R
50|$|The {{temperature}} at Châteaudun was chilly but Peltz observed the He 177s being readied for take-off. Because of the conditions, the ground crews began the cold start procedure. This decision had dire {{consequences for the}} operation. One bomber remained grounded because of a <b>burst</b> <b>tyre</b> but the other 13 took off without incident. Within a short time Peltz was informed that eight pilots had aborted the mission because of over-heating engines which in some instances caught fire.|$|R
50|$|Hannay is handcuffed to Miss Fisher in a Ford Zephyr {{with the}} hitmen, {{who are taking}} them back to London. A <b>burst</b> <b>tyre</b> gives Hannay his chance to escape, but only having one hand to drive with, he crashes the car, forcing him to wander through the bleak Scottish Highlands handcuffed to Miss Fisher. Eventually, they chance upon a bed and breakfast run by Mrs MacDougal (Betty Henderson). Hannay hides their handcuffed {{condition}} and informs her {{that they are a}} runaway couple.|$|R
50|$|An American car races {{past them}} {{at high speed}} but it soon has to stop to change a <b>burst</b> <b>tyre.</b> The car {{is driven by the}} famous Spanish dancer Antonio and his wife Rosita Candelas (Rosita Sergova). They are a fiery couple, always arguing and when Antonio goes down to a stream to wash up after {{changing}} the tyre, Rosita drives away without him. Antonio, stranded in the middle of nowhere, starts dancing down the road in his well-known Zapateado.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 October 2013, a Kabo Air Boeing 747-200 on a Hajj {{charter flight}} from Kano via Sokoto to Jeddah was {{cleared to land}} on Sokoto's runway 08. However the {{aircraft}} continued {{to land on the}} opposite runway 26 for unknown reasons. The aircraft came in too low and hit parts of the ILS before coming to stop with some <b>burst</b> <b>tyres.</b> The Nigerian aviation authorities rated this incident as serious and started investigations on why the crew chose the wrong runway.|$|R
5000|$|... a small fast chic [...] "utility" [...] car it {{sold only}} to country doctors and {{professional}} men. The lively 970 cc engine ran very sweetly. Designed in Paris {{its lack of}} a differential <b>burst</b> <b>tyres</b> broke spring mountings and gave drivers humiliating battles at corners. It was also fifty per cent too expensive for the [...] "utility" [...] class. A made-in-Barlby-Road Talbot it also turned up from Acton (W & G Du Cros) with a different-shaped radiator as a locally assembled Suresnes Darracq.|$|R
50|$|On 22 January 2005, a {{pneumatic}} load <b>tyre</b> suddenly <b>burst</b> {{and caused}} two women passengers to be injured. The train, carrying about 30 passengers, {{was about to}} move from the Chow Kit Road station to the Titiwangsa station when the incident occurred at about 8.50pm. The <b>burst</b> <b>tyre</b> caused a rubber sidewall panel to flip open which then hit the side of a passenger seat and injured a woman's legs and another woman's hands. Train services were suspended for about 30 minutes following the incident.|$|R
5000|$|On 7 November 2004 at 16:35 local time, a Boeing 747-200 freighter, {{owned and}} {{operated}} by Air Atlanta Icelandic, overshot the runway upon take-off at Sharjah International Airport and was damaged beyond repair. The aircraft, registered TF-ARR, had been leased by Lufthansa Cargo to operate Flight 8457 to Frankfurt Airport. The pilots had decided to abort the take-off run even though the remaining runway length did not suffice to bring the aircraft to a halt because of a <b>burst</b> <b>tyre</b> and the ATC notification of an alleged fire (which turned out to be not true). The four persons on board were not injured.|$|R
50|$|First {{race was}} in 1902 at the 3½ mile Canning Town cycling track riding a Matchless {{motorcycle}} with an MMC engine. After leading {{until the last}} lap, a <b>burst</b> <b>tyre</b> caused a crash and Charlie Collier suffered friction abrasions. In 1905, along with his brother Harry Collier participated in the eliminating trial for the International Motor Cycle Cup held in the Isle of Man. Held on a 25-mile section of the Gordon Bennett Trial course, the event was won by J.S.Campbell. Although Harry Collier managed to qualify, the Matchless motorcycle with a JAP engine which Charlie Collier had specially built suffered a broken connecting-rod {{and was forced to}} retire.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to simulate impact damage in stringer stiffened composite fuselage panels from impact by <b>burst</b> <b>tyre</b> debris. The structure being investigated is a composite landing bay panel, which is being designed and tested by Airbus within an EU funded project ALCAS. The impact simulations are performed in the commercial explicit FE code PAM-CRASH and they are provided with basic composites materials property data from which ply damage and delamination model parameters are determined. An in-house model for tyre rubber is provided. A key aspect of the project is to study ply delamination and skin/stringer debonding under impact loads and to compare panel damage for two different composite materials systems...|$|R
50|$|On 21 March 1981 a Caribbean Airways McDonnell-Douglas DC-10-30 {{operating}} a scheduled service from Barbados to London Gatwick suffered tyreburst on takeoff from GAIA, {{as a result}} of hitting an uneven patch on the runway. This caused most overhead lockers to open. Rather than returning to Barbados, the flight deck crew decided to continue to London Gatwick. Due to the flight's early arrival over the UK, ATC instructed the flight deck crew to hold for 25 minutes, following which the aircraft landed safely at Gatwick. There were no injuries among the 340 passengers. According to an airline spokesman, the hot rubber from the <b>burst</b> <b>tyres</b> had caused wiring short-circuits. These in turn had affected some flightdeck instruments.|$|R
5000|$|He {{embarked}} with No. 229 Squadron for North Africa {{on board}} [...] {{and led the}} aircraft in a take-off from ship to North Africa via Malta. Promoted to wing commander in 1941, he took charge of No. 263 Wing where he had joint operational control of the Desert Air Force's fighter squadrons. In November 1941 he spotted an Australian Tomahawk aircraft being forced down by enemy fighters and landed his single-seater to rescue the pilot. Having got Sergeant Burney aboard, he attempted to take-off but suffered a <b>burst</b> <b>tyre</b> and crashed the aircraft. Both he and Burney walked across the desert for four days, avoiding large enemy patrols, to reach safety with a Guards unit.|$|R
5000|$|The 1907 Twin-Cylinder {{class and}} overall race was {{initially}} led by Rem Fowler riding a Norton motor-cycle. The overall lead fell away as Rem Fowler suffered {{a number of}} problems with drive belts and spark plugs and on lap 7 crashed at nearly 60 mph due to a <b>burst</b> <b>tyre</b> at the [...] "Devil's Elbow" [...] on the Kirk Michael to Peel section of the course. Fowler nearly gave up, but was told by a spectator that he led the twin-cylinder class by 30 minutes from Billy Wells and went on to win at an average race speed of 36.22 mph and set the fastest lap of the race at 42.91 mph.|$|R
50|$|July 1993: <b>Tyre</b> <b>burst</b> on a BA plane during takeoff at Heathrow, {{damaging}} the landing gear, wing, fuselage and wiring.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a design concept and prototype development study for a composite wing access cover panel {{which may be}} subjected to high velocity impact loads from <b>burst</b> <b>tyre</b> fragments. A number of design variants were fabricated in unidirectional (UD) carbon fibre reinforced polyetheretherketone (CF/PEEK) using th evacuum forming method. Emphasis in the paper is {{on the use of}} impact simulations at the design stage to assess various design concepts for the composite panel using finite element (FE) simulation techniques. These predict a damage state in the structure after impact loading, which allows the panel concepts to be ranked for impact resistance. This led to a successful design concept, which was verified by structural impact tests, in which the CF/PEEK access panel had an impact resistance liner of high performance polyethylene fabric...|$|R
5000|$|When {{skidding}} occurs, the tyres can be rubbed flat, or even <b>burst.</b> Aircraft <b>tyres</b> {{have much}} shorter lifetimes than cars for these reasons. Since Maxaret reduced the skidding, spreading it {{out over the}} entire surface of the tyre, the tyre lifetime is improved. One early tester summed up the system thus: ...|$|R

50|$|In 1914 Chassagne {{continued}} {{to set up}} World Records for Sunbeam at Brooklands with Toodles V. Chassagne {{took part in the}} Monaco Motor boat races with ‘Toto’ a 2.5lt dohc four valve per cylinder Sunbeam powered racing boat; this may have been a test run for this new engine design; similar designed engines, built in the manner of the Pegueot ‘Charlatans’, from which the design was derived, were used in that year’s Grand Prix Sunbeam racing motorcars. Travelling to the USA for the 1914 Indianapolis 500 Mile, Chassagne with his riding mechanic A P Mitchell in ‘Spotty’ a 1913 Sunbeam G.P. car, qualified at 88.310 mph but crashed on the twentieth lap due to <b>burst</b> <b>tyre.</b> Shortly after in the historic French Grand Prix in the newly designed 4cyl 4.5lt dohc Sunbeam, Chassagne made fastest lap but retired on the thirteenth lap due to big-end failure.|$|R
5000|$|She {{returned}} to England by Lysander, piloted by Bob Large, DFC, of the RAF, on 30 April 1944, landing after a stressful flight {{in which the}} plane {{had been hit by}} anti-aircraft fire over Chateaudun, and Szabo had been thrown heavily about the body of the plane. Large had turned off the intercom when attacked and did not turn it back on {{for the rest of the}} flight, so when the plane landed heavily due to a <b>burst</b> <b>tyre,</b> and he went to get Szabo out, she (thinking they had been shot down and not having seen her blond pilot) let Large have a volley of abuse in French, mistaking him for a German. When she realised what had really happened, he was rewarded with a kiss. [...] Philippe Liewer returned at the same time in another Lysander. On 24 May 1944 Szabo was promoted to Ensign in the FANY.|$|R
5000|$|The {{twin-cylinder}} {{class and}} overall race was initially led by Rem Fowler riding a Norton. On lap 1, Fowler completed {{the course in}} 23 minutes and 19 seconds, in second place was Billy Wells {{in a time of}} 23 minutes and 21 seconds and Charlie Collier in the single-cylinder class with a time of 23 minutes and 45 seconds. The overall lead fell away as Fowler suffered a number of problems with drive-belts and spark-plugs, and on lap 7 crashed at nearly 60 mph due to a <b>burst</b> <b>tyre</b> at the [...] "Devils Elbow" [...] on the Kirk Michael to Peel section of the course. Fowler nearly gave up, but was told by a spectator that he led the twin-cylinder class by 30 minutes from Wells and went on to win at an average race speed of 36.22 mph and set the fastest lap of the race at 42.91 mph.|$|R

50|$|The next day, 13 March 1930, as the Blue Train steamed out of Cannes {{station at}} 17:45h, Barnato and his relief driver, amateur golfer Dale Bourn, {{finished}} their drinks {{and drove the}} Bentley away from {{the bar at the}} Carlton. From Lyon onwards they had to battle against heavy rain. At 4:20h, in Auxerre, they lost time searching for a refueling rendezvous. Through central France they hit fog, then shortly after Paris they had a <b>burst</b> <b>tyre,</b> requiring the use of their only spare. They reached the dock at Boulogne at 10:30h, sailed to England on the cross-Channel packet, and were parking outside The Conservative Club in St. James's Street, London, at 15:20h, four minutes before the Blue Train reached Calais, thus winning the bet. The French authorities promptly fined him a sum far greater than his winnings for racing on public roads, and Bentley was excluded from the 1930 Paris Salon for advertising an unauthorized race.|$|R

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{presented in}} this thesis sought to establish combinatorial effects operating within novel semantic priming paradigms. These experiments demonstrate the combining of several pieces of semantic information (specifically, what certain items afford in terms of some form of interaction) from objects within simple visual scenes, and an account is offered based {{on the construction of}} representations from these presented items. These composite representations subsequently facilitate responses to target items, but it is only with a combination of items (e. g. a knife and a tyre) that is felicitous to a particular event (e. g. bursting) that priming to target items (e. g. a <b>burst</b> <b>tyre)</b> obtains. Priming is less evident when a combination of items is presented that does not allow the same event to occur (e. g. a ruler and a tyre). These combinatorial processes appear to occur in longer time windows than those of automatic visual processes such as gist abstraction, and the representations activated upon viewing these stimuli appear to be specific to the objects presented...|$|R
