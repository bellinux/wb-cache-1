40|$|Four advancements to the {{simulation}} of <b>backshell</b> radiative heating for Earth entry are presented. The {{first of these}} is the development of a flow field model that treats electronic levels of the dominant <b>backshell</b> radiator, N, as individual species. This is shown to allow improvements in the modeling of electron-ion recombination and two-temperature modeling, which are shown to increase <b>backshell</b> radiative heating by 10 to 40 %. By computing the electronic state populations of N within the flow field solver, instead of through the quasi-steady state approximation in the radiation code, the coupling of radiative transition rates to the species continuity equations for the levels of N, including the impact of non-local absorption, becomes feasible. Implementation of this additional level of coupling between the flow field and radiation codes represents the second advancement presented in this work, which is shown to increase the <b>backshell</b> radiation by another 10 to 50 %. The impact of radiative transition rates due to non-local absorption indicates the importance of accurate radiation transport in the relatively complex flow geometry of the <b>backshell.</b> This motivates the third advancement, which is the development of a ray-tracing radiation transport approach to compute the radiative transition rates and divergence of the radiative flux at every point for coupling to the flow field, therefore allowing the accuracy of the commonly applied tangent-slab approximation to be assessed for radiative source terms. For the sphere considered at lunar-return conditions, the tangent-slab approximation is shown to provide a sufficient level of accuracy for the radiative source terms, even for <b>backshell</b> cases. This is in contrast to the agreement between the two approaches for computing the radiative flux to the surface, which differ by up to 40 %. The final advancement presented is the development of a nonequilibrium model for NO radiation, which provides significant <b>backshell</b> radiation at velocities below 10 km/s. The developed model reduces the nonequilibrium NO radiation by 50 % relative to the previous model...|$|R

40|$|A smart-divert {{capability}} {{has been}} added into the Powered Descent Guidance (PDG) software originally developed for Mars pinpoint and precision landing. The smart-divert algorithm accounts for the landing dispersions of the entry <b>backshell,</b> which separates from the lander vehicle {{at the end of}} the parachute descent phase and prior to powered descent. The smart-divert PDG algorithm utilizes the onboard fuel and vehicle thrust vectoring to mitigate landing error in an intelligent way: ensuring that the lander touches down with minimum- fuel usage at the minimum distance from the desired landing location that also avoids impact by the descending <b>backshell.</b> The smart-divert PDG software implements a computationally efficient, convex formulation of the powered-descent guidance problem to provide pinpoint or precision-landing guidance solutions that are fuel-optimal and satisfy physical thrust bound and pointing constraints, as well as position and speed constraints. The initial smart-divert implementation enforced a lateral-divert corridor parallel to the ground velocity vector; this was based on guidance requirements for MSL (Mars Science Laboratory) landings. This initial method was overly conservative since the divert corridor was infinite in the down-range direction despite the <b>backshell</b> landing inside a calculable dispersion ellipse. Basing the divert constraint instead on a local tangent to the <b>backshell</b> dispersion ellipse in the direction of the desired landing site provides a far less conservative constraint. The resulting enhanced smart-divert PDG algorithm avoids impact with the descending <b>backshell</b> and has reduced conservatism...|$|R

40|$|This work quantifies the <b>backshell</b> {{radiative}} heating {{experienced by}} payloads on human- scale vehicles entering the Martian atmosphere. Three underlying configurations were studied: a generic sphere, a sphere-cone forebody with a cylindrical payload, and an ellipsled. Computational fluid dynamics simulations {{of the flow}} field and radiation were performed using the LAURA and HARA codes, respectively. Results of this work indicated the primary contributor to radiative heating is emission from the CO 2 IR band system. Furthermore, the <b>backshell</b> radiation component of heating can persist lower than 2 km/s during entry and descent. For the sphere-cone configuration a peak heat flux of about 3. 5 W/cm(exp. 2) was observed at the payload juncture during entry. At similar conditions, the ellipsled geometry experienced about 1. 25 W/cm(exp. 2) on the <b>backshell,</b> {{but as much as}} 8 W/cm(exp. 2) on the base at very high angle of attack. Overall, this study sheds light on the potential magnitudes of <b>backshell</b> radiative heating that various configurations may experience.

40|$|A {{technique}} for predicting supersonic pitch damping of blunt axisymmetric bodies from static CFD data is presented. The contributions to static pitching moment due to forebody and aftbody pressure distributions are broken out and considered separately. The one-dimension moment equation is cast {{to model the}} separate contributions from forebody and aftbody pressures with no traditional damping term included. The aftbody contribution to pitching moment is lagged by a phase angle of the natural oscillation period. This lag represents the time for aftbody wake structures to equilibrate while the body is oscillation. The characteristic equation of this formulation indicates that the lagged <b>backshell</b> moment adds a damping moment equivalent in form to a constant pitch damping term. CFD calculations of the <b>backshell's</b> contribution to the static pitching moment {{for a range of}} angles-of-attack is used to predict pitch damping coefficients. These predictions are compared with ballistic range data taken of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) capsule and forced oscillation data of the Mars Viking capsule.
