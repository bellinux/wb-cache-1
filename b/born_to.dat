The children {{of four of}} his wives {{would go on to}} rule their own kingdoms: Ratompoindroandriana gave birth to Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana at Ambohimanga; Ramananandrianjaka gave birth to Andriantomponimerina at Ambohidratrimo; Ramananimerina had her son Andrianjakanavalona at Antananarivo; and Rasolomanambonitany had Andrianavalonimerina near Ambohitrabiby. The children of four other wives would renounce all claims to the throne: Andriamborosy and Rafaralahimanjaka, <b>born</b> <b>to</b> Renilambo in Ambohidrapeto; Andriantsilavo, <b>born</b> <b>to</b> Ranavalona in Anosimanjaka; Andrianavalona, <b>born</b> <b>to</b> Rakalafohy in Isoraka; and Andriankotofananina, <b>born</b> <b>to</b> Reninandriankotofananina in Anosipatrana.

She was housed with her adoptive mother at Ambohipeno and died without producing children of her own, although she likewise adopted a child named Ramasina, who was most likely the son of her sister.|$|E
