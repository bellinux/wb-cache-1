40|$|There are {{significant}} engineering challenges in placing the sea-crossing <b>bridge</b> <b>piers</b> in more or les shallow coastal waters because, {{as well as}} having to withstand storm-force waves and tidal currents, the <b>bridge</b> <b>piers</b> have to remain stable on a sea bed that may be continuously changing. One of the major challenges faced by designers is how to predict, and prevent, scour of the seabed sediments around the sea-crossing <b>bridge</b> <b>piers.</b> This paper describes a physical model study on scour and scour countermeasure for sea-crossing <b>bridge</b> <b>piers.</b> A 1 : 49 scale movable bed model tests were {{carried out in the}} Near-shore Wave Basin (NSWB, 27 m x 19 m) at the Tainan Hydraulics Laboratory, National Chang Kung University (NCKU), Tainan, Taiwan, with the sea-crossing <b>bridge</b> <b>piers</b> in the test area. Three series of physical model tests were performed in this study. The aim of the first test series is to investigate the maximum scour depth for the initial construction of <b>bridge</b> <b>piers</b> with only one pier model. Then the second test series were conducted to investigate the greatest magnitude of local scour and potential scour area in the sand bed around the sea-crossing <b>bridge</b> group <b>piers</b> with no scour protection. Based on the analysis from the former NSWB experimental results, the suitable scour countermeasure for sea-crossing <b>bridge</b> <b>piers</b> would be proposed and validated its function of preventing scour in the third test series...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bridge</b> <b>piers</b> {{built in}} active seismic regions can sustain large {{residual}} displacements following a strong earthquake. In many recent major earthquakes residual displacement enforced demolition of <b>bridge</b> <b>piers</b> {{due to the}} serviceability and/or safety concerns. Consequently, {{in order to reduce}} residual displacement after major earthquakes many innovative methods were explored in the last decade. One of such innovative method is to replace the conventional longitudinal steel reinforcement in the plastic hinge regions of <b>bridge</b> <b>piers</b> with super-elastic Shape Memory Alloy (SMA). This study numerically investigates efficacy of SMA reinforced concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>piers</b> on mitigating the residual displacement after major seismic events. In this study, firstly numerical model and the computational platform used for the analysis are validated using data from shake table experiment of scaled SMA reinforced pier. Then numerical study on three prototype bridge bents with single and multiple piers are conducted to compare the effectiveness of using the SMA bars in plastic hinge regions to reduce the residual displacement of the <b>bridge</b> <b>piers.</b> The seismic performance of the three bridge bents with steel and SMA reinforced piers are evaluated using incremental dynamic analysis. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of using SMA reinforcement on reducing the permanent displacement of <b>bridge</b> <b>piers</b> after severe earthquake shakings...|$|R

500|$|On September 5, 1904, {{the bridge}} finally got its {{transfer}} to the bridge corporation, and a new toll-taker was hired for the new bridge. After this, life went back to normal in both communities. In October 1928, after the charter and opening [...] of the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, the bridge company was asked to sell the bridge to the commission for $60,000 (1928 USD), and on June 14, 1929, the commission abolished tolls along the bridge, making it free to cross at either end. With the bridge now {{under the control of}} the toll bridge commission, extensive repairs began on the 25-year-old structure. This construction included new beams for the bridge, new flooring, and an extensive repair to one <b>bridge</b> <b>pier.</b> Although the construction had only taken four months to complete, it still caused havoc in commuting across the structure. In 1940, the Pennsylvania approach to the bridge was designated as Pennsylvania Route 709, a designation that would last six years, being decommissioned in 1946. [...] The structure would face its most recent strength test in 1955, after the massive flooding from Hurricane Diane wreaked havoc in the area. The structure received minor damage in the flood, and the traffic was only halted for a day or two afterward. The design in the 1904 plan worked, as the structure was not at flood level.|$|E

40|$|The flow {{constriction}} due to <b>piers</b> {{of highway}} <b>bridges</b> results in producing backwater rise upstream such bridges, especially at floodplain periods. This backwater rise depends mainly on both flow properties and geometrical characteristics of piers. In {{the present research}} paper, the backwater rise due to <b>bridge</b> <b>piers</b> was experimentally investigated for extreme ratios of piers thickness to channel width (tPS/B) under {{a wide range of}} both subcritical and supercritical flow conditions between <b>bridge</b> <b>piers.</b> The present study illustrates that the backwater rise upstream <b>bridge</b> <b>piers</b> depends mainly on both flow type between piers and constriction ratio, while it is secondary depends on geometrical shape of pier endnoses. Also, the experimental results illustrates that the backwater rise at supercritical flow conditions between piers agreed satisfactory with the corresponding computed values from the most widely relationships published by Yarnell [10] than that for subcritical flow conditions between piers. The results of the backwater rise due to constriction of flow by <b>bridge</b> <b>piers</b> presented in this research paper are employed in development of two formulas, which could be used in computing backwater rise at both subcritical and supercritical flows between <b>bridge</b> <b>piers...</b>|$|R

The slope was dangerously steep and I thought the guide was using his ax wildly, but we came to a deep crack in the wall and when Walters suggested that it might help us out of the gully I threw off the rope. It would have been of no use if I had fallen, and I meant to come down unless I saw a fairly safe route to the snowfield.

60|$|Five {{minutes later}} Thurston, running across a bending plank, halted {{on the rock}} which served as {{foundation}} for the main <b>bridge</b> <b>pier.</b> Beside him Summers shouted confused orders {{to a group of}} struggling men. The moonlight beat down mistily through the haze that rose from the river, and Geoffrey could see the long wedge-headed timber framing that he had built, beside the wing on the shore-side, so that any trunk floating down would cannon off at an angle and shoot safely between the piers. But one huge fir had proved too long for the pass, and when its butt canted, the other end had driven athwart the point of the wedge, after which, because the river was black with drifting logs, other heavy trunks drove against it and jammed it fast. Panting men were hard at work with levers and pike-poles striving to wrench the massive trunk clear, and one lighted an air-blast flare, whose red glare flickered athwart the strip of water foaming between the piers. It showed that some of the logs forced up by the pressure were sliding out above the others, while, amid a horrible grinding, some sank. One side of the river was blocked by a mass of timber that was increasing every moment. Thurston feared that the unfinished piers could not long withstand the pressure, and he remembered that his own work would be paid for only on completion. Nevertheless, he passed several minutes in a critical survey, and then glanced towards certain groups of dark figures watching for the approaching ruin.|$|E
