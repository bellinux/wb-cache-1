50|$|The main {{threat to}} {{porpoises}} is static fishing {{techniques such as}} gill and tangle nets. Bycatch in <b>bottom-set</b> gill nets is considered the main anthropogenic mortality factor for harbour porpoises worldwide. Several thousand die each year in incidental bycatch, which has been reported from the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, off California, and along {{the east coast of}} the United States and Canada. <b>Bottom-set</b> gill nets are anchored to the sea floor and are up to 12.5 mi in length. It is unknown why porpoises become entangled in gill nets, since several studies indicate they are able to detect these nets using their echolocation. Porpoise-scaring devices, so-called pingers, have been developed to keep porpoises out of nets and numerous studies have demonstrated they are very effective at reducing entanglement. However, concern has been raised over the noise pollution created by the pingers and whether their efficiency will diminish over time due to porpoises habituating to the sounds.|$|E
50|$|Dolphin {{deaths in}} <b>bottom-set</b> {{gillnets}} and trawl fisheries {{have been responsible}} for substantial population declines in the last four decades. Gillnets are made from lightweight monofilament that is difficult for dolphins to detect, especially when they are distracted (e.g. chasing fish) or moving around without using echolocation. Hector's and Maui's dolphins swim into the nets, get caught, and drown - or more accurately, suffocate (breathing is active in dolphins). Hector's dolphins are actively attracted to trawling vessels and can frequently be seen following trawlers and diving down to the net. Occasional mistakes can lead to injury or death.|$|E
50|$|The longtail {{butterfly}} ray is widely caught for meat and as bycatch in artisanal and commercial fisheries, including in India, Thailand, and Indonesia. It is taken using bottom trawls, <b>bottom-set</b> gillnets, {{and to a}} lesser degree trammel nets and other fishing gear. Though specific population and catch data are lacking, the longtail {{butterfly ray}} is thought to be susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate and the fact that pregnant females often abort their young when captured. Given the high intensity of fishing pressure across most of its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened.|$|E

50|$|The next {{greatest}} {{source of}} human-induced mortality is entanglement in fixed fishing gear such as <b>bottom-set</b> groundfish gillnet gear, cod traps and lobster pots. Between 1970 and October 2006, {{there have been}} 8 instances where entanglements have been the direct cause of death of North Atlantic right whales. This represents 11% of all deaths documented during that period. From 1986 to 2005, there were a total of 61 confirmed reports of entanglements, including the aforementioned mortalities. It is likely that official figures underestimate the actual impacts of entanglement. It is believed that chronically entangled animals may in fact sink upon death, due to loss of buoyancy from depleted blubber reserves, and therefore escape detection.|$|E
5000|$|Every year, {{millions}} of sharks {{are killed by}} drift-nets, by-catch, revenge actions, beach protective shark meshing, commercial-, recreational- and spear-fishing. The main risk is from by-catch of indirect methods of line fishing and particularly <b>bottom-set</b> commercial fishing lines targeting wobbegong sharks.The Grey Nurse sharks are particularly vulnerable to these threats due to their late maturation and low breeding success. They reach sexual maturity {{at the age of}} 6-8 years and give birth to 1 or 2 young every second year, thus the population grows very slowly.

50|$|The venomous stings of the white-edge {{freshwater}} whipray {{are capable}} of inflicting excruciating and even fatal wounds on humans. This species is extremely rare, with only about 10 specimens having been deposited in museum collections. Most of its range is subject to heavy fishing pressure; this ray is infrequently caught using fish traps, spears, and <b>bottom-set</b> lines; it is sold for meat and the aquarium trade. Habitat loss and degradation {{as a result of}} pollution, logging and dam construction are likely to pose an even a greater threat to the survival of this species. In Thailand, dams built on the Chao Phraya have fragmented the resident stingray population and effectively reduced its genetic diversity. Because of diverse threats faced by this ray and the lack of exchange between the different rivers it inhabits, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the white-edge freshwater whipray as Endangered. The Thai government began a captive breeding program for this and other endangered freshwater stingrays at Chai Nat during the 1990s, but by 1996 the program had been placed on hold.|$|E

There has been a recent re-evaluation of the potential of pingers and their use in other fisheries due to their growing success.An experiment on the California drift gill net fishery demonstrated how acoustic pingers reduce marine mammal bycatch. It was shown that bycatch was significantly reduced for common dolphins and sea lions. Bycatch rates were also lower for other cetacean species like the Northern right whale dolphin, Pacific white-sided dolphin, Risso’s dolphin and Dall's Porpoise. It is agreed upon that the more pingers on a net, the less bycatch. There was a 12-fold decrease in common dolphin entanglement using a net with 40 pingers.However, the widespread use of pingers along coastlines effectively excludes cetaceans such as porpoises from prime habitat and resources. Cetaceans which are extremely sensitive to noise are effectively being driven from their preferred coastal habitats by the use of acoustic devices. In poorer quality habitat, harbour porpoises are subjected to increased competition for resources. This situation is recognized as range contraction which can be a result of climate change, anthropogenic activity, or population decline. Large scale range contractions are considered indicative of impending extinction. A similar form of deterrent is noise pollution originating from vessel traffic.|$|E

40|$|To {{make clear}} the {{relationship}} between grain size distribution and geomorphology in deltaic shallow marine environments, the writer analyzed numerous bottom sediments by his method (Moriyama 1976). Geomorphology in the northwestern Mikawa Bay {{is shown in figure}} 1 ． Delta platform with about 1. 5 km width with extends along coast and it is occupied by tidal flat. Off the Yahagi River coast, steep fore-set slope extends south-eastward far off the fore-set slope. Statistical four moments of dredged samples (Tab. 1) and also correlation between mean and skewness (Fig. 3) indicate that most of delta platform deposits are coarser than 3. 0 phi, most of <b>bottom-set</b> slope deposits are finer than 6. 0 phi and strong minus correlation is between mean and skewness. From size frequency distridution curves in normal probability scale (Fig. 4, 5), the writer calculated mean and standard deviation of each sub-population in rifference to all samples (Fig. 6). Almost delta platform deposits are composed by two or three sub-populations and means of sand population agglomerate near 3. 0 phi and 1. 0 phi. Clay population have large standard deviation and their means are mostly 8 - 9 phi. Lack of sub-population in 4 - 7 phi is common to the all samples. Association of sub-populations of bottom-set-slope deposits is very complicated and their clay population shows high percentage in contrast to delta platform deposits. Lack in 5 - 6 phi can be seen {{as well as in the}} platform deposits. Above-mentioned facts indicate that there is a very striking contrast between coarse sands prevailing sand populations inside of fore-set slope and fine clay prevailing clay population beyond the fore-set slope. The writer considers it is occured by the following reasons; inside of the fore-set slope, the silt size grains are not produced so much, drained sediments with much sand populations from river mouths are deposited on shallow delta platform on which violent tidal current flows, and, beyond the fore-set slope, sediments containing much clay population spread out to deposit on the <b>bottom-set</b> slope further off the coast where week tidal current flows...|$|E

40|$|In fluvial, cross-bedded sediments, the {{orientation}} and plunge {{of the long}} axes of pebbles {{are found to be}} guided, among other factors, by the initial slope of the depositing bed; and this plunge and orientation may vary in the different portions of the cross-strata. Elongate pebbles, in general, tend to be arranged transversely tothe current direction on the topset and bottomset units having extremely low initial dips, and arranged longitudi-nally on the foreset units having greater initial dips. Plunge and imbrication of pebbles are controlled primarily by the development of "current crescents" around the pebbles in a stream bed. Plunges of the long axes of the transverse pebbles on the topset and <b>bottom-set</b> units are usually low and are not generally related to the current direction. On the foreset units, long axes of pebbles plunge markedly towards the general current direction.

40|$|Whilst the harbour {{porpoise}} {Phocoena phocoena) {{is the most}} frequently observed cetacean in the UK, it is at risk from habitat degradation, pollution, incidental capture in fishing nets and anthropogenic disturbance. UK, European and international initiatives have highlighted the conservation need to obtain {{a better understanding of}} this species. This research, conducted over 5 years (1999 - 2004) aimed to further the scientific knowledge of the {{harbour porpoise}} in order to influence future conservation initiatives. Studies into the relative abundance, density, distribution, habitat use and behaviour were conducted through combinations of shore- and boat-based research. Technical trials of a towed acoustic device (T-POD) were also conducted from onboard the research vessel. Additional analysis of previously collected acoustic data from <b>bottom-set</b> gillnets was carried out This research presents some of the first examination of the west coast for the harbour porpoise. Porpoise density was found to be exhibit significant inter-anniial differences, with increases noted off West Scotiand and a decrease observed for the South West In the case of Northern freland these results are some of the first quantitative analysis of the harbour porpoise within the region. A statistically significant relationship with depth and in particular the 100 m depth contour was also observed. The area off north Devon (Morte Point) is considered to offer an important feeding site for the species, where porpoises were found to aggregate in areas of high tidal flow. Site-specific differences in behaviour, group size and distance from shore were observed depending on time of day and tidal cycle. A full description of the ethology of the harbour porpoise is also given and the potential affects of dolphin watching tourism assessed. Porpoises were observed to regularly engage in cooperative feeding and aerial activity, previously considered rare. The behaviours, as recorded from shore, differed considerably to those recorded from the boat. This highlights the need for precautionary management to increasing numbers of dolphin watching tour operators in UK waters. Acoustic detection of harbour porpoises around <b>bottom-set</b> gillnets revealed that porpoises are present around the nets on a 24 hour basis. This is highly significant in terms of bycatch mitigation as it indicates that porpoises are successfiilly avoiding entanglement for 99. 75 % of encounters. In terms of monitoring populations the T-POD was found to present a cheap and quick method which detected an additional 10 % of all porpoise encounters which were not detected visually. The results presented here make a significant contribution to the scientific knowledge of the harbour porpoise, which will provide a basis for future research and conservation initiatives.

In this work we present a general methodology to derive predictive models of fish freshness under different storage conditions. The approach makes use of the theory of optimal experimental design, to maximize data information and in this way reduce the number of experiments. The resulting growth model for specific spoilage microorganisms in hake (Merluccius merluccius) is sufficiently informative to estimate quality sensory indexes under time-varying temperature profiles. In addition it incorporates quantitative information of the uncertainty induced by fish variability. The model has been employed to test the effect of factors such as fishing gear or evisceration, on fish spoilage and therefore fish quality. Results show no significant differences in terms of microbial growth between hake fished by long-line or <b>bottom-set</b> nets, within the implicit uncertainty of the model. Similar conclusions can be drawn for gutted and un-gutted hake along the experiment horizon. In addition, whenever there is the possibility to carry out the necessary experiments, this approach is sufficiently general to be used in other fish species and under different stress variables...|$|E
