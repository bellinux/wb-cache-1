5|$|By {{the time}} Beatty regained {{control over his}} ships, after having <b>boarded</b> , <b>the</b> German ships had too great a lead for the British to catch them; at 13:50, he broke off the chase.

5|$|Once the fleets {{were close}} enough, exchanges of {{missiles}} began, ranging from combustible projectiles to arrows and javelins. The aim {{was not to}} sink ships, but to deplete {{the ranks of the}} enemy crews before the boarding actions, which decided the outcome. Once the enemy strength was judged to have been reduced sufficiently, the fleets closed in, the ships grappled each other, and the marines and upper bank oarsmen <b>boarded</b> <b>the</b> enemy vessel and engaged in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E

5|$|The 21st, about 960 strong, <b>boarded</b> <b>the</b> steamer Northerner on January 6, 1862. The fleet {{transporting}} Burnside's North Carolina Expedition encountered harsh weather off {{the coast}} of Cape Hatteras.

The Maya visitors accepted gifts of beads, and the leader indicated with signs that they would return to take the Spanish ashore the following day.|$|E
