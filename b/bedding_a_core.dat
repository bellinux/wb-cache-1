40|$|We use helium {{released}} during mechanical {{deformation of}} shales {{as a signal}} to explore the effects of deformation and failure on material transport properties. A dynamic dual-permeability model with evolving pore and fracture networks is used to simulate gases released from shale during deformation and failure. Changes in material properties required to reproduce experimentally observed gas signals are explored. We model two different experiments of $^ 4 $He flow rate measured from shale undergoing mechanical deformation, <b>a</b> <b>core</b> parallel to <b>bedding</b> and <b>a</b> <b>core</b> perpendicular to <b>bedding.</b> We find that the helium signal is sensitive to fracture development and evolution as well as changes in the matrix transport properties. We constrain the timing and effective fracture aperture, {{as well as the}} increase in matrix porosity and permeability. Increases in matrix permeability are required to explain gas flow prior to macroscopic failure, and the short-term gas flow post failure. Increased matrix porosity, is required to match the long-term, post-failure gas flow. Our model provides the first quantitative interpretation of helium release as a result of mechanical deformation. The sensitivity of this model to changes in the fracture network, as well as to matrix properties during deformation, indicates that helium release {{can be used as a}} quantitative tool to evaluate the state of stress and strain in earth materials.

40|$|We {{present results}} from new {{geophysical}} data allowing 3 -D modelling {{of the water}} flow within Subglacial Lake Ellsworth (SLE), West Antarctica. Our simulations indicate that this lake has a novel temperature distribution due to significantly thinner ice than other surveyed subglacial lakes. The critical pressure boundary (tipping depth), established from the semi-empirical Equation of State, defines whether the lake's flow regime is convective or stratified. It passes through SLE and separates different temperature (and flow) regimes {{on either side of}} the lake. Our results have implications for the location of proposed access holes into SLE, the choice of which will depend on scientific or operational priorities. If an understanding of subglacial lake water properties and dynamics is the priority, holes are required in a basal freezing area at the North end of the lake. This would be the preferred priority suggested by this paper, requiring temperature and salinity profiles in the water column. A location near the Southern end, where bottom currents are lowest, is optimum for detecting the record of life in the bed sediments; to minimise operational risk and maximise the time span of <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> sediment <b>core,</b> <b>a</b> location close to the middle of the lake, where the basal interface is melting and the lake bed is at its deepest, remains the best choice. Considering potential lake-water salinity and ice-density variations, we estimate the critical tipping depth, separating different temperature regimes within subglacial lakes, to be in about 2900 to 3045 m depth...|$|R
30|$|There are 21 meiofaunal taxa and 63 {{nematode}} genera {{that have}} been identified from <b>a</b> tropical seagrass <b>bed</b> of Thalassia hemprichii in Ludao, Taiwan. Although the compositions of higher meiofaunal taxa are undistinguished, according to correspondence analysis, the assemblages of nematode genera differ substantially between the seagrass bed and unvegetated sediments. Regarding the nematodes, approximately 50 % of genera are restricted to the seagrass bed whereas 6 % are restricted to unvegetated sediments, which indicate both habitats possessing distinct infaunas. The number of replicates for reasonable estimation of the local diversity index is calculated by the randomization technique. For local seagrass <b>beds,</b> only <b>a</b> single <b>core</b> is sufficient for reliably estimating meiofaunal diversity, but at least three <b>cores</b> or <b>a</b> sample size of 300 individuals is needed for the nematode community.|$|R
40|$|An {{optical fiber}} probe was {{developed}} successfully {{for the study}} of bubble characteristics in three-phase fluidized <b>beds.</b> <b>A</b> single <b>core</b> optical fiber of 400 (mu) m was used in this study. The design of the probe was based on the difference of refraction indices between the gas and the liquid phases. The radius of the 2 ̆ 2 U 2 ̆ 2 bend was approximately 0. 5 mm in this study.;The three phases {{used in the present study}} were air, water, and narrow cut glass beads of 250 (mu) m average diameter. The solid particles were fluidized by cocurrent upward flows of air and water with the later one as continuous phase. The experiments were performed in two different columns. The first one was <b>a</b> two dimensional <b>bed</b> which had <b>a</b> width of 65 cm and 2. 5 cm in thickness. The other fluidized <b>bed</b> was <b>a</b> cylindrical column of 20 cm in diameter.;Bubbles in freely bubbling fluidized beds rose faster than single bubbles in liquids or in liquid fluidized beds. Log-normal bubble size distributions were found for most of the operating conditions studied. The distributions were widened by increasing the gas velocity.;Higher bubble frequency or gas hold-up was favored by increasing either the gas or the liquid velocity. The radial profiles of bubble frequency or gas hold-up were flat across the bed at low liquid velocity. Bell shaped profiles were observed when higher liquid flow rates were used.;In the axial direction, bubble frequency or gas hold-up increased slightly with height and this tendency was more noticeable at high liquid velocity. The solid and the liquid hold-ups were fairly constant in the lower two thirds of the fluidized bed. In the top region of the bed, the solid hold-up decreased rapidly and the liquid hold-up increased accordingly.;The average bubble velocity was obtained through the use of cross correlation and phase angle analysis. Material balances on gas phase were performed with the information of local gas hold-up and average bubble velocity. It was demonstrated that the consistency of measurements by the optical probes was satisfactory...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: There {{is growing}} {{interest}} about biological effective dose (BED) and its application in treatment plan evaluation {{due to its}} stronger correlation with treatment outcome. An approximate biological effective dose (<b>BED</b> <b>A)</b> equation was introduced {{in order to simplify}} BED calculations by treatment planning systems in multi-phase treatments. The purpose of this work is to reveal its mathematical properties relative to the true, multi-phase BED (BED T) equation. Methods : The BED T equation was derived and used to reveal the mathematical properties of <b>BED</b> <b>A.</b> MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) was used to simulate and analyze common and extreme clinical multi-phase cases. In those cases, percent error and Bland-Altman analysis were used to study the significance of the inaccuracies of <b>BED</b> <b>A</b> for different combinations of total doses, numbers of fractions, doses per fractions and α/β values. All the calculations were performed on a voxel-basis in order to study how dose distributions would affect the accuracy of <b>BED</b> <b>A.</b> Results: When the voxel dose-per-fractions (DPF) delivered by both phases are equal, <b>BED</b> <b>A</b> and <b>BED</b> T are equal (0 % error). In heterogeneous dose distributions, which significantly vary between the phases, there are fewer occurrences of equal DPFs and hence the imprecision of <b>BED</b> <b>A</b> is greater. It was shown that as the α/β ratio increased the accuracy of <b>BED</b> <b>A</b> would improve. Examining twenty-four cases, it was shown that the range of DPF ratios for 3 % P error varied from 0. 32 to 7. 50 Gy, whereas for P error of 1 % the range varied from 0. 50 to 2. 96 Gy. Conclusion : The DPF between the different phases should be equal in order to render <b>BED</b> <b>A</b> accurate. OARs typically receive heterogeneous dose distributions hence the probability of equal DPFs is low. Consequently, the <b>BED</b> <b>A</b> equation should only be used for targets or OARs that receive uniform or very similar dose distributions by the different treatment phases.
