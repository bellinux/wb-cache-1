5|$|Some {{adjectives}} are inflected for {{degree of}} comparison, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix -er marking the comparative, and -est marking the superlative: a small boy, the <b>boy</b> <b>is</b> {{smaller than the}} girl, that <b>boy</b> <b>is</b> the smallest. Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as good, better, and best. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions, with the adverb more marking the comparative, and most marking the superlative: happier or more happy, the happiest or most happy. There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common {{at the expense of}} the inflected form.|$|E

50|$|The male {{phenomenon}} {{refers to}} the fact that a large majority of juvenile delinquents <b>are</b> men, or <b>boys.</b> In the United States, <b>boys</b> <b>are</b> five times more likely than girls to become juvenile delinquents. Moreover, there are many suggested explanations as to why it <b>is</b> that <b>boys</b> commit more crimes than girls. One comes from theorists who believe men and <b>boys</b> <b>are</b> naturally more aggressive than women and girls. Another theory communicates the idea that men and boys commit more crimes because of societal pressures to be masculine and aggressive. A third theory suggests that the manner in which <b>boys</b> <b>are</b> treated by their families calls for more criminal action. The crime rates vary across boys of different races. They are mentioned in the 'juvenile delinquency statistics' section above, {{as well as in the}} 'cradle to prison pipeline' section below, but to review, African-American <b>boys</b> <b>are</b> more likely to become juvenile delinquents than White and Latino <b>boys.</b> Latino <b>boys</b> <b>are</b> more likely to become juvenile delinquents than White <b>boys</b> <b>are.</b> One clear way to explain this difference in crime rates among different races of <b>boys</b> <b>is</b> by looking at their poverty rates.|$|R

When they read about a former pupil who has become head of ICI, they always say, 'But that boy's an idiot. He's crap at geography.' The <b>boy</b> <b>is</b> condemned forever because in the 1960s he didn't know all the capitals of the Third World.|$|E
