25|$|Since modern {{thyristors}} {{can switch}} {{power on the}} scale of megawatts, thyristor valves have become the heart of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) conversion either to or from alternating current. In the realm of this and other very high-power applications, both electrically triggered (ETT) and light-triggered (LTT) thyristors are still the primary choice. The valves are arranged in stacks usually suspended from the ceiling of a transmission building called a valve hall. Thyristors are arranged into a diode <b>bridge</b> <b>circuit</b> and to reduce harmonics are connected in series to form a 12-pulse converter. Each thyristor is cooled with deionized water, and the entire arrangement becomes one of multiple identical modules forming a layer in a multilayer valve stack called a quadruple valve. Three such stacks are typically mounted on the floor or hung from the ceiling of the valve hall of a long-distance transmission facility.|$|E

500|$|A true hybrid divider/coupler with, theoretically, {{infinite}} {{isolation and}} directivity {{can be made}} from a resistive <b>bridge</b> <b>circuit.</b> [...] Like the tee circuit, the bridge has [...] insertion loss. [...] It has the disadvantage that it cannot be used with unbalanced circuits without the addition of transformers; however, it is ideal for [...] balanced telecommunication lines if the insertion loss is not an issue. [...] The resistors in the bridge which represent ports are not usually part of the device (with the exception of port 4 which may well be left permanently terminated internally) these being provided by the line terminations. [...] The device thus consists essentially of two resistors (plus the port 4 termination).|$|E
500|$|Bridge {{topology}} is {{an important}} topology with many uses in both linear and non-linear applications, including, amongst many others, the bridge rectifier, the Wheatstone bridge and the lattice phase equaliser. [...] There are several ways that bridge topology is rendered in circuit diagrams. [...] The first rendering in figure 1.8 is the traditional depiction of a <b>bridge</b> <b>circuit.</b> [...] The second rendering clearly shows the equivalence between the bridge topology and a topology derived by series and parallel combinations. [...] The third rendering is more commonly known as lattice topology. [...] It is not so obvious that this is topologically equivalent. [...] It {{can be seen that}} this is indeed so by visualising the top left node moved {{to the right of the}} top right node.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{possible}} to transform a bridgedT section into a Lattice, or Xsection. [...] The Xsection {{is a kind of}} <b>bridge</b> <b>circuit,</b> but usually drawn as a lattice, hence the name. [...] Its topology makes it intrinsically balanced but it is never used to implement the constant resistance filters of the kind described here because of the increased component count. [...] The component count increase arises out of the transformation process rather than the balance. [...] There is however, one common application for this topology, the lattice phase equaliser, which is also constant resistance and also invented by Zobel. [...] This circuit differs from those described here in that the <b>bridge</b> <b>circuit</b> is not generally in the balanced condition.|$|E

5000|$|It was a low-distortion audio {{oscillator}} used for testing sound equipment. It used the Wien <b>bridge</b> oscillator <b>circuit,</b> {{that had been}} the subject of Bill Hewlett's Masters thesis. It was also the first such commercial oscillator to use a simple light bulb as the temperature-dependent resistor in its feedback network. The light bulb was an inexpensive and effective automatic gain control that not only kept the oscillator output amplitude constant, but it also kept the oscillator's loop gain near unity. The latter is a key technique for achieving a low distortion oscillator. Earlier, Meacham had used light bulbs in <b>bridge</b> <b>circuits</b> to stabilize and linearize oscillators in 1938.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a study aimed at developing an indigenous {{moisture measuring device}} from locally available materials for grains {{based on the principle}} of resistance change of the material with corresponding change in moisture during drying. The developed device has four copper electrode cups positions in which both gauging and dummy copper electrode cups were placed to form Wheatstone <b>bridge</b> <b>circuits</b> of full, half and quarter for four, two and one gauging copper electrode cups respectively, while the remaining positions were used as dummies.
