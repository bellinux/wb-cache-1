(The {{monument}} to Winegar’s <b>battery</b> <b>stands</b> on Powers Hill forward of its actual position.http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=17889) The battery took part in the cannonade that preceded a largely successful effort to recapture ground lost on July 2 when most of XII Corps was sent to the left flank of the army as reinforcements.|$|R
50|$|Devil's Gap Footpath links Gibraltar's Upper Town to Devil's Gap Battery, one of {{the oldest}} {{artillery}} batteries on the peninsula. It offers views over the city, Gibraltar Harbour and Bay of Gibraltar. It takes its name from the rocky outcrop {{at the top of the}} path on which the <b>battery</b> <b>stands,</b> which was called Punta del Diablo ("Devil's Point") by the Spanish. At 130 m above sea level, the outcrop provided a strategic location on the escarpment above the town and therefore commanded a wide range over the Bay of Gibraltar, making it hard for any enemy movements to go unnoticed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>battery</b> <b>stands</b> on {{the site}} of two emplacements {{originally}} constructed under General Edward Cornwallis between 1762-77. It takes its name from its position facing south-west. In the late 19th century it became (along with Buffadero Battery and Jews' Cemetery Battery) one of three batteries on or below Windmill Hill to be equipped with BL 9.2 inch gun Mk V guns, two of which were installed in 1886. These were upgraded to BL 9.2 inch gun Mk X guns in 1901, mounted on Mark V barbettes. They faced out towards the Mediterranean to cover naval traffic through the Straits of Gibraltar.|$|R
50|$|The boom {{across the}} river, {{intended}} to detain shipping under the guns, is variously {{described in the}} sources. Richard Burton and Commander Kennedy RN said it comprised 7 chains twisted together, of which (wrote Burton) the largest had a 1.75 inch diameter link. It was made fast to a windlass supported by a house about 100 yards from the bank. Nearer the <b>battery</b> <b>stood</b> a still larger capstan. Other sources, notably George Thompson (de facto chief engineer of Paraguayan army) wrote that there were three chains side-by-side, of which the heaviest had 7.5 inch links, sustained by barges and canoes.|$|R

During the 1779-1783 Great Siege of Gibraltar it mounted at least one mortar, possibly more. In 1878 two RML 9 inch 12 ton guns were proposed and installed at the battery in June 1881, but later dismounted in 1900. In July 1896 work started on a new platform {{to the north of}} the battery for two QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval Mark I guns which were ready on 31 August 1896.|$|R

UNESCO in 1982 included the battery, together with Old Havana, in its list of UNESCO World Heritage sites. There is a small museum featuring the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis in the battery. During the crisis, Fidel Castro and Che Guevara set up their headquarters there to prepare the defense of Havana from aerial attack. The museum is in tunnels there known as the Cueva Taganana (Taganana Cave), for the hill on which the <b>battery</b> <b>stands.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} {{front was}} defended by Marshals Michel Ney and Auguste de Marmont, {{and the eastern}} front by Marshal Jacques MacDonald. The artillery reserve and parks, ambulances, and baggage stood near Leipzig, which Napoleon made his supply base for the battle. The bridges on the Pleisse and White Elster rivers were defended by infantry and a few guns. The main <b>battery</b> <b>stood</b> in reserve, and during battle was to be deployed on the Gallows Height. This battery was {{to be commanded by}} the artillery expert Antoine Drouot. The western flank of the French positions at Wachau and Liebertwolkwitz was defended by Prince Joseph Poniatowski and Marshal Pierre Augereau and his young French conscripts.|$|R

Cooper's Battery B, First Pennsylvania Light Artillery, on East Cemetery Hill about 4:00 PM. It was exposed to enfilade fire from Benner's Hill and Seminary Ridge. Around nightfall, two Confederate brigades from the division of Major General Jubal Early attacked the hill. It broke the thin Union front line {{at the foot of the}} hill in two places. In other places they were repelled. Some Confederates reached the top of the hill, and one group attacked the left of Ricketts' battery, trying to spike the guns. The fight for the guns became hand to hand, but the Confederates were unable to capture the whole battery. Eventually Union reinforcements from the II Corps brigade of Col. Samuel S.

50|$|In {{the final}} design, {{the plan to}} put guns on the fort's roof were abandoned. Instead, eleven casemates were placed in an arc {{on one side of}} the D-shaped fort, {{pointing}} downriver towards Lower Hope Point. An open <b>battery</b> <b>stood</b> at the west end of the casemates, mounting three guns that pointed upriver toward Gravesend and Tilbury. This was to enable artillery support for the older forts at those two towns, which were now relegated to the second line of defence. A single-storey defensible barracks built from Kentish Ragstone stood at the rear of the fort. It was equipped with loopholes so that the garrison could fight off an attack from the landward side. Three caponiers protected the perimeter and an open parade ground occupied the centre of the fort. A ditch originally lay in front of the casemates and open battery but was filled in during the 1880s. The magazines underneath the casemates and open battery consisted of a line of storerooms for shells and cartridges, linked by a lighting passage at the rear and an ammunition passage at the front.|$|R

We chose Zinc tin oxide (ZTO) as it has been shown in literature to be a good oxide for batteries. We tried improving it by making new Rubik-cube like microstructure of it and more interestingly coating a layer of carbon on it. We could show from our experiments that the carbon layer is around 10 nm and has an effect on the battery performance. The ZTO/SnO 2 has a capacity of 400 mAh/g after 20 cycles and the same material after carbon coating layer has around 550 mAh/g after 20 cycles which shows a clear improvement in the one with carbon coating. Then we were able to discover a unique structure of ZTO which to our knowledge has been produced first time. This has a capacity of around 400 mAh/g after 20 cycles...|$|R
