50|$|Many {{standard}} magnesium alloys {{are easily}} <b>welded</b> <b>by</b> <b>gas</b> or resistance-welding equipment, but cannot be cut with an oxygen torch. Magnesium alloys are not welded to other metals, because brittle inter-metallic compounds may form, {{or because the}} combination of metals may promote corrosion. Where two or more parts are welded together, their compositions must be the same. Soldering of magnesium alloys is feasible only for plugging surface defects in parts. The solders are even more corrosive than with aluminium, and the parts should never be required to withstand stress. Riveted joints in magnesium alloy structures usually employ aluminium or aluminium-magnesium alloy rivets. Magnesium rivets are not often used because they must be driven when hot. The rivet holes should be drilled, especially in heavy sheet and extruded sections, since punching tends to give a rough edge to the hole and to cause stress concentrations.|$|R

Due to the martensitic microstructure, the hardness values of HAZ of P 91 steel are over 350 HV. However, the hardness value of the P 22 HAZ less than 350 HV. P 91 HAZ has a higher hardness value than P 22 HAZ because of its higher hardenability and due to phase transformation from martensite to ferrite. The interaction between the too high hardness microstructure with hydrogen can result in the hydrogen induced cracking (HIC) initiation in the HAZ.
