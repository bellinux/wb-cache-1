5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{loses his}} job at the Pawtucket Brewery because Superstore USA has its own brewery and they cannot compete. Back at the house, Brain, chris, and peter watches tv and saids that quahog is {{suffering}} a heat wave across the city, with superstore USA takeing away the nighborhood power to allow temperatures to up with any cooling. Disjointed, Peter joins an angry protest outside the store, but after entering the store to encourage customers to leave, Peter is impressed by its central cooling system, and decides to become an employee also working under Mr. Penisburg with Meg as his superior. Later, his daughter is promoted to assistant manager by Mr. Penisburg, who immediately instructs her to fire Peter. Despite her reservations about her father, she chooses her family over her job and quits. In the meantime, Brian and Stewie decide to eliminate the superstore completely by retrieving Peter's tank, and driving it through the superstore, while Peter and Meg escape through an emergency exit. After <b>bulldozing</b> the store, Brian and Stewie drive outside and demolish it and Penisburg with the tank's cannon. Immediately afterwards, the electricity supply to Quahog is restored, and life returns to normal.|$|E
5|$|The diplosegments of millipedes {{have evolved}} in {{conjunction}} with their burrowing habits, and nearly all millipedes adopt a mainly subterranean lifestyle. They use three main methods of burrowing; <b>bulldozing,</b> wedging and boring. Members of the orders Julida, Spirobolida and Spirostreptida, lower their heads and barge {{their way into the}} substrate, the collum being the portion of their exoskeleton that leads the way. Flat-backed millipedes in the order Polydesmida tend to insert their front end, like a wedge, into a horizontal crevice, and then widen the crack by pushing upwards with their legs, the paranota in this instance constituting the main lifting surface. Boring is used by members of the order Polyzoniida. These have smaller segments at the front and increasingly large ones further back; they propel themselves forward into a crack with their legs, the wedge-shaped body widening the gap as they go. Some millipedes have adopted an above-ground lifestyle and lost the burrowing habit. This may be because they are too small to have enough leverage to burrow, or because they are too large to make the effort worthwhile, or in some cases because they move relatively fast (for a millipede) and are active predators.|$|E

This angered some Berkeley students and residents, who noted that the <b>bulldozing</b> took place during winter break when many students were away from campus, and followed the administration-backed police response at Occupy Cal which occurred less than two months prior.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{bridge across}} the Fraser River, the Port Mann Bridge to Surrey, opened in 1964. Two new {{universities}} were established, the British Columbia Institute of Technology in 1960 and Simon Fraser University in 1965; both have satellite campuses in Vancouver. Residents of Strathcona – most of them Chinese – formed a protest movement led by civic activist Mary Lee Chan and prevented {{the construction of a}} freeway which would have resulted in the <b>bulldozing</b> of the neighbourhood. In 1967, the Greater Vancouver Regional District was incorporated. Greenpeace, one of the leading international environmental organizations, was founded in Vancouver in 1971.|$|E
25|$|Christmas tree {{farming is}} a labor-intensive process. Depending {{on the quality}} of the land, <b>bulldozing</b> may need to be {{undertaken}} prior to planting, in order to remove obstacles such as large trees or rocks. If the volume of undergrowth requires it, the soil may be tilled; tilling can help remove any debris remaining after tree or weed removal. Both woody plants and herbaceous weeds must be controlled prior to planting; this is most often done by application of a chemical herbicide. In addition, some types of fertilizers must be introduced into the soil prior to planting. The work done before planting tree seedlings plays an important role in the overall success of a Christmas tree crop.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand {{was one of}} {{the four}} Commonwealth nations to vote in favour of the 1947 UN {{partition}} resolution. Since then, most New Zealand governments have been supportive of Israel. After 53 years of full diplomatic relations, the Israeli Embassy in Wellington closed in 2004 due to $5.4 million in cost-cuts by the Israeli Foreign Ministry. It was speculated that trade with Arab countries were a major factor. In June 2004, the New Zealand Government criticized Israel's policy of <b>bulldozing</b> Palestinian homes and donated $534,000 to aid homeless Palestinians. At one time there were four missions in the South Pacific area in Canberra, Sydney, Wellington and Suva in Fiji. Following the closure, only Canberra remained open, which was responsible for New Zealand-Israeli Relations. In 2009, the Israel Foreign Ministry announced the reopening of the embassy in Wellington.|$|E
25|$|The only {{species of}} Rattus that {{is capable of}} {{surviving}} the climate of Alberta is the brown rat, which can only survive in the prairie region of the province, and even then must overwinter in buildings. Although it is a major agricultural area, Alberta is far from any seaport and only a portion of its eastern boundary with Saskatchewan provides a favorable entry route for rats. Brown rats cannot survive in the wild boreal forest to the north, the Rocky Mountains to the west, nor can they safely cross the semiarid High Plains of Montana to the south. The first brown rat did not reach Alberta until 1950, and in 1951, the province launched a rat-control program that included shooting, poisoning, and gassing rats, and <b>bulldozing,</b> burning down, and blowing up rat-infested buildings. The effort was backed by legislation that required every person and every municipality to destroy and prevent the establishment of designated pests. If they failed, the provincial government could carry out the necessary measures and charge the costs to the landowner or municipality.|$|E
500|$|Construction crews {{have also}} worked to {{rehabilitate}} the river channel below the dam by clearing out mining debris and excess brush. However, these activities {{have been criticized}} by some environmental groups as too heavy-handed. The California Water Impact Network stated channel rehabilitation was [...] "an activity equivalent to a clear-cut on a Wild and Scenic River." [...] <b>Bulldozing</b> of the riverbanks to clear space for juvenile salmon habitat has harmed steelhead spawning grounds, impacted public access and allowed the spread of invasive plant species. Between 2005 and 2011, restoration work cost a total of $36 million.|$|E

500|$|Most street {{newspapers}} {{report on}} issues regarding homelessness and poverty, sometimes {{functioning as a}} main source of information on policy changes and other practical issues {{that are relevant to}} the homeless but may go unreported in mainstream media. [...] Many feature contributions from the homeless and the poor in addition to articles by activists and community organizers, including profiles of individual street newspaper vendors. [...] For example, the first edition of Washington, D.C.'s Street Sense included a description of a prominent homeless community, an interview with a congresswoman, an editorial about {{the costs and benefits of}} taking a job, several poems about homelessness, a how-to column, and a section for recipes. A 2009 issue of the Lawrence, Kansas-based Change of Heart included a story on the recent <b>bulldozing</b> of a homeless camp, a review of a book on homelessness, a description of the Family Promise organization for homeless support, and a list of community resources; much of this content was submitted by the homeless. The writing style is often simple and clear; social scientist Kevin Howley describes street newspapers as having a [...] "native eloquence".|$|E
500|$|... "To do {{this any}} other way would have been needlessly contentious," [...] Daley {{explained}} {{at a news conference}} Monday morning. Daley argued that the airport was a threat to Chicago's high-rise cityscape and its high-profile skyscrapers, such as the Sears Tower and the John Hancock Center. Daley criticized the Federal Aviation Administration, saying [...] "Now, think of that; Mickey and Minnie have it. I mean, I can't believe that. They get it first before we get it?", referring to the post-9/11 air space restrictions in place over Orlando, Florida. [...] "The signature act of Richard Daley's 22 years in office was the midnight <b>bulldozing</b> of Meigs Field," [...] according to Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn. [...] "He ruined Meigs because he wanted to, because he could," [...] Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass wrote of Daley. [...] "The issue is Daley's increasingly authoritarian style that brooks no disagreements, legal challenges, negotiations, compromise or any of that messy give-and-take normally associated with democratic government," [...] the Chicago Tribune editorialized. The Federal Aviation Administration cited the City for failure to comply with federal law requiring thirty-day advance notice to the FAA of plans for an airport closure. The city was fined $33,000, the maximum allowable. The city paid the fine and repaid $1 million in misspent federal airport development grants. Daley defended his actions by claiming that the airport was abandoned, {{in spite of the fact}} that the Chicago Fire Department had several helicopters based on the field at the time, in addition to the dozens of private aircraft left stranded.|$|E
