Following the USDA announcement to allow choices in purchasing decisions for ground beef, many school districts stated that they would opt out of serving ground <b>beef</b> <b>with</b> LFTB. By June 2012, 47 out of 50 U.S. states declined to purchase any of the product for the 2012–2013 school year while South Dakota Department of Education, Nebraska, and Iowa chose to continue buying it.|$|E

Cleveland also has plenty of corned <b>beef,</b> <b>with</b> nationally renowned Slyman's, on the near East Side, a perennial winner of various accolades from Esquire Magazine, including being named the best corned beef sandwich in America in 2008. Other famed sandwiches include the Cleveland original, Polish Boy, a local favorite found at many BBQ and Soul food restaurants. With its blue-collar roots well intact, and plenty of Lake Erie perch available, the tradition of Friday night fish fries remains alive and thriving in Cleveland, particularly in church-based settings and during the season of Lent.

25|$|Moose are hunted {{as a game}} {{species in}} many of the {{countries}} where they are found. Moose meat tastes, wrote Henry David Thoreau in “The Maine Woods”, “like tender <b>beef,</b> <b>with</b> perhaps more flavour; sometimes like veal”. While the flesh has protein levels similar to those of other comparable red meats (e.g. beef, deer and elk), it has a low fat content, and the fat that is present consists of a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fats rather than saturated fats.|$|E

25|$|Certified Angus Beef (CAB) in Canada and the United States is a specification-based, branded-beef {{program which}} was founded in 1978 by Angus cattle {{producers}} to increase demand for their breed of cattle, by promoting the impression that Angus cattle have consistent, high-quality <b>beef</b> <b>with</b> superior taste. The brand is owned by the American Angus Association and its 35,000 rancher members. The terms Angus Beef or Black Angus Beef are loosely and commonly misused or confused with CAB; this is especially common in the food service industry. The brand or name Certified Angus Beef cannot be legally used by an establishment that is not licensed to do so. In the UK the equivalent is Aberdeen Angus, marketed as higher quality and associated with stricter animal welfare rules. Notable for the herd being free of BSE during the BSE epidemic in the UK. Similar schemes are used elsewhere as in Certified Angus Beef in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Hard Network Out – For some reason, {{unbeknownst to}} {{humanity}} at present, professional journalist and Miami Herald columnist Greg Cote cannot {{understand the concept}} of the hard network {{out at the end of}} an hour of the show and will continue to talk through the break. There was a period on the show wherein Le Batard would wear a hat with a clock on the brim to help Cote understand how much time remained at the end of a segment, but to no avail. The phenomenon has now morphed into Le Batard and Stugotz attempting to trap Cote by waiting until late in an hour to ask his opinion, setting him up to ramble through the out. The show maintains frequently that this feat is not a contrived gag but is an actual problem for Cote that they exploit to great comedic benefit. Le Batard and Stugotz also use this as a prank; during an episode in February 2017, the two had Cote on the phone to discuss a Twitter <b>beef</b> <b>with</b> Dwyane Wade, and cut him off at the hard network out before he could respond to Dan's question regarding it. Le Batard admitted he was on the show just so they could cut him off.|$|E

This extravagance was more noteworthy with his contemporary readers for Bond eating exotic, local foods when abroad, {{at a time when}} most of his readership did not travel abroad.|$|E

500|$|The {{sociologist}} Bob Ashley {{observed that}} while people in Britain might {{agree that the}} core national diet consisted of items such as the full English breakfast, roast <b>beef</b> <b>with</b> all the trimmings, tea with scones, and fish and chips, few had ever eaten the canonical English breakfast, lunch and dinner in any single day, and many probably never ate any item from the list at all regularly. In any case, Ashley noted, the national diet changes with time, and cookery books routinely include dishes of foreign origin. He remarked that a National Trust café, whose manager claimed [...] "We're not allowed to do foreign food... I can't do lasagne or anything like that", in fact served curry, because [...] "seemingly curry is English". Anglo-Indian cuisine has indeed {{been part of the}} national diet since the eighteenth century.|$|E
500|$|Pilot {{whale meat}} is {{available}} for consumption in very few areas of Japan, mainly along the central Pacific coast, and also {{in other areas of}} the world, such as the Faroe Islands. The meat is high in protein (higher than beef) and low in fat. [...] Because a whale's fat is contained in the layer of blubber beneath the skin, and the muscle is high in myoglobin, the meat is a dark shade of red. In Japan, where pilot whale meat can be found in certain restaurants and izakayas, the meat is sometimes served raw, as sashimi, but just as often pilot whale steaks are marinated, cut into small chunks, and grilled. [...] When grilled, the meat is slightly flaky and quite flavorful, gamey, though similar to a quality cut of <b>beef,</b> <b>with</b> distinct yet subtle undertones recalling its marine origin.|$|E
500|$|While {{some school}} districts have their own suppliers, many school districts {{purchase}} beef directly from the USDA and {{do not know what}} is in the beef. For the year 2012, the USDA planned on purchasing 7 million pounds of lean beef trimmings for the U.S. national school lunch program. USDA spokesman Mike Jarvis stated that of the 117 million pounds of beef ordered nationally for the school lunch program in the past year, 6% was LFTB. An analysis of California Department of Education data indicated that [...] "anywhere from none to nearly 3 million pounds of beef from the USDA that was served in California schools last year could have contained lean finely textured beef". According to the USDA, the cost differential between ground <b>beef</b> <b>with</b> and without the additive has been estimated at approximately 3%.|$|E
