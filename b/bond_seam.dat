30|$|Three {{ultrasound}} arrays {{provided by}} IKTS each consisting of 16 elements, a centre frequency of 5  MHz, an element pitch of 400  μm, an element width of 350  μm and an element length of 8  mm are {{arranged for the}} ultrasonic testing of the three areas of the <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> as shown in Fig.  1 on the right. This arrangement enables arrays A and B to achieve special resolution of 400  µm when evaluating the adhesive in the x-direction using the pulse echo method. The arrays A and B can inspect an area of 6.5  mm each, whereby the resolution for one test position consists of 14 individual measurements. This is done through a line scan with a 3 element aperture that is shifted by one element after every shot. This test area is sufficient for the complete testing of <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> area b, whereas <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> area a is usually larger. This means that this array cannot completely test <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> area a. Array C can focus the ultrasound in the y-direction to the strong curved edge. The ultrasonic transducers are controlled by a PCUS from Fraunhofer IKTS. This allows 64 individual channels {{to be controlled by}} the quadruple multiplexing of the 16 physical channels. Based on the PCUS Pro II with 48 (up to 128) native channels a system can be set up without multiplexing.|$|R
30|$|For {{testing the}} seam loop c a {{precisely}} teaching the robot path {{is necessary to}} have a constant position of the seam loop in the UT probe. However, {{the position of the}} <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> in the inspection system can be checked using the ultrasonic signals. To determine the y-position of the metal sheet in the ultrasonic <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> sensor (see Fig.  1), the elapsed time of the echoes from the water to steel transition of the two arrays A and B can be evaluated by using a defined time gate. This can also be done for the x-position control by using a pulsed echo measurement of array C. As both the robot path and the <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> pack size are subject to deviations, a deviation of 0.4  mm in the x and y directions is considered tolerable. This tolerance window is set via the gate area. In the representation of the results in this document, this digital position evaluation is implemented using a red or green decision of the actual positional for validation of the measurement.|$|R
30|$|<b>Seam</b> <b>bonding</b> {{is used in}} {{automotive}} {{engineering in}} particular {{because of the high}} degree of automation and, {{in the case of the}} table-top <b>seam</b> <b>bonding</b> process, because of the very fast cycle times that are achieved. This hybrid joining process plastically bends the sheet metal edge of the outer part around the inner part producing a form and force-locking joint [1, 2]. The gap between the two sheet metal parts is filled with adhesive. This bonding firstly prevents the ingress of moisture at the joint level, and secondly the adhesive provides the bond with greater bending and torsional rigidity [3]. The fact that this joining method, in contrast to welding, does not leave any visible evidence of the connection, allows it to be used in areas where the joint is visible. In the automotive industry, this benefit makes the process particularly suitable for use for the closures (e.g. doors, hood top, luggage compartment door) where <b>seam</b> <b>bonding</b> is used to combine the visible outer skin parts with the inner structure and crash resistant parts.|$|R

The conclusions are given to ensure better quality of roof covering materials...|$|R
30|$|Figure  11 {{shows the}} result of the {{ultrasonic}} examination for determining the degree of filling of seam loop C. Influences due to a deviation of the seam loop position in the sensor can be excluded because of the good coupling. The red marked areas in coupling evaluation in the upper <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> area b arises due to the larger active sensor area (6.5  mm) in contrast to the flange length of seam area b (6  mm). Consequently, the inner sheet is sounded in this area, whereby the echo resulting from the material transition is generated outside the gate for an OK coupling. A change in the orientation of the <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> loop of the sample within the sensor can be excluded as a further factor influencing the result. For this purpose, the straight edge of the laboratory sample has been investigated in this series of tests. Consequently, it can be ensured that the ultrasound results are solely related to the adhesive distribution and not to the geometrical shape of the <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> or the orientation of the seam loop. Further investigations must show the extent to which this can be ensured later in the series process.|$|R
30|$|The {{folding process}} in the {{automobile}} industry has to be simplified {{in order to obtain}} a general model for master samples. These probes are used to validate the ultrasonic system with defined errors. To do this, specimens were defined that have a sufficiently long (150  mm) and straight seam line. The flange length produced is 8  mm (<b>seam</b> <b>bonding</b> area a and c) and therefore within the limits of 4  mm to 12  mm for typical <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> flange length [20]. According to the technical drawing, the geometrical dimensions of the <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> are two adhesive layers of 200  μm and two steel sheets of 700  μm thickness. Glass spheres of a defined size are mixed together with the adhesive to ensure the correct adhesive layer thickness [21]. Because of the low percentage by volume of 2 % the effect of the glass spheres on the ultrasonic wave is negligible. Both the inner and outer sheet metal panels have two holes cut by laser to use as reference points for fixing the position of the metal sheets in the folding tool. For estimating the minimum defect sizes and defect classes [7] that can be detected by the system, the <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> has been produced with a Viton foil in place of the adhesive in seam area a and b. This film, which has similar acoustic properties as the adhesive, has laser-perforated holes of various different diameters ranging from 1 to 6  mm. The overlapping of these defects is excluded by the minimum of 9  mm distance between the individual holes. This distance is greater than the length (8  mm) of the ultrasonic transducers used. The use of the Viton foil instead of the adhesive is necessary since the real manufacturing process cannot produce defects with defined dimensions.|$|R
30|$|The probe {{with the}} {{arrangement}} of the three ultrasound arrays on the <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> is shown in Fig.  1 on the right. The gap between the ends of the two leading wedges of array A and B is determined to be 3.5  mm, whereby array C is predominantly obscured by arrays A and B. An arc phased array C is not possible because of the different radii of the seam loop within one mounting part. Water is continuously fed between the seam and the leading wedges as a couplant. Any fluctuations in the thickness of the <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> pack size in the y direction (see Fig.  1) are to be compensated by the water layer or the articulated joint of the ultrasonic test system, which has a plier-like design.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Rural {{and urban}} road {{development}} programmes for connecting {{towns and villages}} have been consuming huge amount of funds over last few decades; however, there is a dire necessity to connect the rural population to the urban centres. To provide connectivity to all rural habitations, {{it is essential to}} adopt cost effective and durable roads in our country. The prohibitive cost of commercially available geotextiles in India can be overcome by the extensive use of discarded and used polymeric bag fabrics. In addition, the exponential growth in construction activity has increased the volume of discarded polymeric cement bags, which are not bio-degradable and disposed off indiscriminately creating an imbalance in eco-system. These polymeric bags can be joined together by several methods such as epoxy <b>bonding,</b> thermal <b>bonding,</b> <b>seaming</b> and stitching etc., and the same can be used as an alternative component instead of commercially available geotextiles. If this program is effectively implemented, then it’ll provide several jobs for the rural poor and will also significantly bring down the degree of pollution caused by the indiscriminate discarding of plastic wastes. This research paper focuses on the productive utilization of discarded and used High Density Poly-Ethylene (HDPE) bag fabrics as a geotextile material in the construction of rural roads. The properties of HDPE bag fabrics for their efficient use have been explored. Suitability can be tested by finding the tensile strength properties of the HDPE bag fabrics using CBR Plunger Push through Test (ASTM D 4833). The desired equipment for testing the same can be found in any undergraduate level technical institutions...|$|R
30|$|For the {{ultrasound}} investigation of bonds, well-known manufacturers offer {{a wide variety}} of ultrasonic transducers. However, all systems are currently hand-guided designed for the testing of even bondings or just for seam area a. Inline systems for testing seam bondings are not available. Despite the fact that the testing of all <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> areas directly in the production line offers the opportunity to shorten the process control loop effectively.|$|R
30|$|The inline {{measurement}} of the seam areas a and b in prototypical series operation is currently being performed. For this application, {{it has been shown}} that defects within the adhesive bond are identified. In area b the limit of the adhesive trace can also be recognised. This is useful as an input parameter for optimisation purposes, for example, for adapting the adhesion application. This eliminates the need for destructive tests. The automated evaluation has already been implemented within the software for determining the degree of filling of the <b>seam</b> <b>bond.</b> This is evaluated by means of a pixel evaluation. Therefore, a statistic can be provided to the productions sites concerned, to identify trends and, in particular, permanently faulty areas. Efforts must still be made in the consideration of the defect position. An open channel detected within the seam areas a or b, which enables the penetration of moisture into the joining plane, must necessarily trigger an not in order evaluation. This functionality has been implemented in the software in a further development step. Furthermore, the array A has to be enlarged to cover the entire <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> area a.|$|R
30|$|To {{determine}} {{the suitability of}} the ultrasound examination, various methods are used to validate {{the results of the}} nondestructive testing system. Thus, the results of the phased array system are matched with X-ray computer tomography as well as destructive tests. Because of the manufacturing process of <b>seam</b> <b>bonds,</b> the reliable preparation of artificial damages with adhesive is not possible. The adhesive is therefore replaced for the assessment and qualification of the error recognition. A Viton foil is used in its place, which has similar acoustic properties like the adhesive.|$|R
30|$|The {{use of a}} {{coupling}} condition is shown to be particularly useful where the geometrical shape of the component is not level. Without simultaneous evaluation of the coupling condition, a defect in the left test area 1 would be detected in the ultrasound result (see Fig.  12). However, in this area the coupling shows a red evaluation so that {{the evaluation of the}} adhesive assessment is not possible due to the position or orientation of the <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> in the sensor. In a further software development step, the pixels in the adhesive evaluation are greyed out where there is a negative coupling condition.|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{adhesive}} bonding concepts {{have been developed}} at NASA Langley which employ induction heating of thermoplastic composite matrices directly along the bond line and/or adherends without heating the entire structure, the supports, and the fixtures of the bonding assembly. Short term thermal cycling and water boil exposures have shown encouraging environmental stability for these rapid bonds. These bonding techniques have been extended to continuous <b>seam</b> <b>bonding</b> of metallic and composite panels with promising results for the bonding of both like and unlike adherends; the portability of the apparatus suggests that field repairs of damaged structures are possible...|$|R
30|$|The {{non-destructive}} test systems returns a similar result. But a large defect {{can be seen}} in the left-hand section of the result image for area 1. However, the coupling evaluation shows a red coupling exactly for this area so that no adhesive evaluation can be given at this point. Reason for the red coupling could be air bubbles in the water layer or an overly strong tilting of the seam in the sensor. In area 2 of the Fig.  12 the destructive test reveals several meander structures. This is indicated by the yellow or red pixels in the ultrasound C Scan. However, the spatial resolution of the ultrasound system is less than the optical inspection of the opened <b>seam</b> <b>bond.</b> This is the reason why defects in the C Scan of the ultrasonic system look different and are more clustered.|$|R
30|$|The joining {{process of}} <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> {{is used in}} {{automobile}} construction because of the non-visible joints on mounted parts such as doors, hoods or luggage compartment doors. With these components, a structure-providing inner panel is joined with the outer panel, which is visible to the customer. Besides providing stability, particularly {{in the event of}} a crash, the joining level is also filled with adhesive to increase the stability and to prevent the ingress of moisture that causes corrosion. These mechanical connections must be tested to ensure that the requirements for proper bonding have been met. As the destructive test used today requires metallographic laboratory with special trained personnel, significant scrap cost and a time consuming process control loop, considerable efforts are being made to develop a capable non-destructive and as far as possible in-line test method. State of the art non-destructive inspection systems for <b>seam</b> <b>bonds</b> are insufficient regarding full part accessibility and reliability in terms of detectability and validation. This paper is focussed on new developed free configurable three-transducer ultrasonic phased array technology including algorithms for data validation and evaluation for an automated process control loop in the automotive car body shop. The paper end with an statistical classification based on an 5 -month measurement campaign under industrial in-line conditions. In a first step, a list of possible defects was collected and the detectability in different seam areas was calculated by sound field simulation of the amplitude signals. Second, based on the results from simulation, a measurement setup as excitation sequence was defined. Based on the theoretical findings a inspection system was designed and realized. Within a measurement campaign the inspection system was evaluated in terms of detectability of minimal defect size under non-laboratory conditions. This includes a permanent proof of coupling conditions, monitoring of misalignments, e.g. tilting and surface defects of the car body. In the last step, the testing system is build up and tested within the assembly line. These measurement results show that the identification of common process defects is possible.|$|R
30|$|The {{cause of}} this false {{evaluation}} of the adhesive by the ultrasound system {{can be explained by}} the path of the ultrasonic wave along the outer sheet. To achieve sufficient sound energy and to compensate for possible losses due to air bubbles in the water coupling, the first six elements of arrays A or B sound towards the adjacent array C. Disregarding the opening angle of the transmitted ultrasonic wave and any present side lobes, an area of 2.3  mm is excited in the front part of the <b>seam</b> <b>bond,</b> whereas micro sections of the laboratory samples show the length of the seam channel to be approximately 0.8  mm. As a result, the predominant part of the sound path lies in the seam areas a and b, where the ultrasonic wave interacts with any adhesive which may be present. A shortening of the propagation path within seam areas a and b can be achieved by reducing the elements emitting the sound. However, this is associated with a significant decrease in signal stability and an accompanying reduction in the repeatability of the measurement.|$|R
30|$|In Fig.  7, three {{characteristic}} echo sequences can {{be identified}} from the A scan of the real transmissions measurement. Through a parameter simulation study, {{the origins of the}} individual echoes can be determined. The echo sequence S 1 at approximately 12  μs comes from multiple reflections of the excitation pulse on the sheet metal. The time displacement of the echo sequence S 2 for an air filled <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> (at approx. 20  μs) and the echo from the sample with adhesive (at approx. 19  μs) can be explained by using simulations as displacement in the y-direction (see Fig.  1). The permitted displacements of s 1 and s 2, which are indirectly checked by the coupling conditions, must take into account for the evaluation range. The signal between the echoes at 12 and 19  µs can be explained by a formation of a lamb wave of S 1 mode in the sheet metal (see Fig.  6). The lamb wave following the curvature of the seam radius whereby it is transferring energy into the wedge of the array C.|$|R
40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{solid state}} welding process invented in 1991 at The Welding Institute in the United Kingdom. A weld {{is made in the}} FSW process by {{translating}} a rotating pin along a weld seam so as to stir the sides of the seam together. FSW avoids deleterious effects inherent in melting and promises to be an important welding process for any industries where welds of optimal quality are demanded. This article provides an introduction to the FSW process. The chief concern is the physical effect of the tool on the weld metal: how weld <b>seam</b> <b>bonding</b> takes place, what kind of weld structure is generated, potential problems, possible defects for example, and implications for process parameters and tool design. Weld properties are determined by structure, and the structure of friction stir welds is determined by the weld metal flow field {{in the vicinity of the}} weld tool. Metal flow in the vicinity of the weld tool is explained through a simple kinematic flow model that decomposes the flow field into three basic component flows: a uniform translation, a rotating solid cylinder, and a ring vortex encircling the tool. The flow components, superposed to construct the flow model, can be related to particular aspects of weld process parameters and tool design; they provide a bridge to an understanding of a complex-at-first-glance weld structure. Torques and forces are also discussed. Some simple mathematical models of structural aspects, torques, and forces are included...|$|R
40|$|Microtubules are {{constructed}} from alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers that are arranged into protofilaments. Most commonly there are 13 or 14 protofilaments. A series of structural investigations using both electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction {{have indicated that}} there are two potential lattices (A and B) in which the tubulin subunits can be arranged. Electron microscopy has shown that kinesin heads, which bind only to beta-tubulin, follow a helical path with a 12 -nm pitch in which subunits repeat every 8 -nm axially, implying a primarily B-type lattice. However, these helical symmetry parameters are not consistent with a closed lattice and imply that there must be a discontinuity or "seam" along the microtubule. We have used quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy to obtain the first direct evidence for the presence of this seam in microtubules formed either in vivo or in vitro. In addition to a conventional single seam, we have also rarely found microtubules in which {{there is more than one}} seam. Overall our data indicates that microtubules have a predominantly B lattice, but that A lattice bonds between tubulin subunits are found at the seam. The cytoplasmic microtubules in mouse nerve cells also have predominantly B lattice structure and A lattice <b>bonds</b> at the <b>seam.</b> These observations have important implications for the interaction of microtubules with MAPs and with motor proteins, and for example, suggest that kinesin motors may follow a single protofilament track...|$|R
30|$|The {{sound field}} {{simulations}} can also demonstrate {{the relationship between}} the transmission measurement for the evaluation of the seam loop c and the degree of adhesive filling in seam areas a or b. The simulation results show that under identical excitation, detection and evaluation range the integral energy method within a gate G of a seam completely filled with air is 2.1 times greater than {{in the case of a}} <b>seam</b> <b>bond</b> completely filled with adhesive. This deviation between OK and not okay bonding is already reduced to 1.4 times if the defect area only extends to seam loop C. Subsequently, the selective evaluation of seam loop C by transmission measurement is only possible if this result is used in connection with the results of the pulse echo measurement of seam areas a or b. Consequently there are two conditions for the test of the adhesive filling of the seam loop C. First the position in x and y direction of the seam in the sensor must be within a certain range (±  1  mm). This is ensured by three impulse echo measurements of the arrays A, B and C. The second condition assumes a complete filling of the seam areas a and b. This is checked by the ultrasonic system. Only if both conditions for a test position are fulfilled, the validation of the seam area c is possible. In the present case, a negative adhesive evaluation for areas a and b has been established by the pulse echo measurement of arrays A and B. Subsequently, because of {{the relationship between the}} transmission measurement and the degree of adhesive filling of areas a and b, no result of the transmission measurement for the evaluation of seam loop c can be indicated for this test position.|$|R
