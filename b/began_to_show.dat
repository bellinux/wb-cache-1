5|$|Midstate Television {{was bought}} out by media magnate Paul Ramsay's Ramcorp Ltd. in October 1987. It was soon merged with Ramcorp's other stations, RVN/AMV and NEN/ECN. In 1988, Midstate Television was renamed Prime Television and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> {{increased}} Seven Network programming in readiness for aggregation.|$|E
5|$|The {{property}} was bid on in December 1999, and acquired by a non-profit, Davis Theater Preservation Corporation, headed by community resident Mary Edsey. The {{property was}} sold to Special Real Estate Services in 2000, and thereafter the theater <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> first run films once again.|$|E
5|$|Wallhead then <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> {{improved}} boxing and knockout {{power in}} his next few fights, {{the first of which}} was against Tom Haddock in April 2008 who he defeated via submission due to punches.|$|E

5|$|As a {{young and}} {{promising}} defenceman, Bourdon was regularly mentioned in rumours of trades for more offence at the forward positions. Most significantly, he was speculated {{to be part of}} a package in exchange for Tampa Bay Lightning forward Brad Richards. Although Bourdon had a powerful shot, he did not play defence responsibly enough to earn a regular spot on the roster. He <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> signs of improvement and maturity as the Canucks used him more in the 2007–08 season.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{between the}} French and the Portuguese <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> {{itself in the}} region during this period. Because the Portuguese-operated trading posts in Cacheu and Farim asked for higher prices than the French-operated trading posts in Carabane and Sédhiou, the Portuguese lost many traders to the French. This trend led to the ceding of Ziguinchor to France, which was {{negotiated}} in Carabane in April 1888 between Commissioner Oliveira and Captain Brosselard-Faidherbe.|$|E
5|$|Ecgberht {{was buried}} in Winchester, as were his son, Æthelwulf, his grandson, Alfred the Great, and his great-grandson, Edward the Elder. During the ninth century, Winchester <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> signs of urbanisation, {{and it is likely}} that the {{sequence}} of burials indicates that Winchester was held in high regard by the West Saxon royal line.|$|E

5|$|Feynman tried LSD {{during his}} {{professorship}} at Caltech. He also tried marijuana and ketamine experiences at John Lilly's famed sensory deprivation tanks, {{as a way}} of studying consciousness. He gave up alcohol when he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> vague, early signs of alcoholism, as {{he did not want to}} do anything that could damage his brain.|$|E
5|$|The Congress party <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> {{weakness}} {{in the years after}} the 1962 election. In the summer of 1962, DMK conducted demonstrations against rising prices. These demonstrations turned violent throughout the state leading to the arrest of 6500 DMK volunteers, 14 members of the assembly and four members of the Lok Sabha, including Annadurai.|$|E
5|$|The {{diverging}} {{interests of}} the League members <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show,</b> and the alliance began to unravel. In 1573, the Holy League fleet failed to sail altogether; instead, Don John attacked and took Tunis, only {{for it to be}} retaken by the Ottomans in 1574. Venice, fearing the loss of her Dalmatian possessions and a possible invasion of Friuli, and eager to cut her losses and resume the trade with the Ottoman Empire, initiated unilateral negotiations with the Porte.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening of}} a trade hall in Wetherby in 1710 brought about further {{industrial}} development, most of this was still {{on a small scale}} until the 19th century, but Leeds like Manchester <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> growing industrialisation before many other towns and cities across the industrial belts of Yorkshire and Lancashire did, providing Leeds with a few rare examples of industry from before the period that is generally accepted as the beginning of the industrial revolution (late 18th century) had begun.|$|E
5|$|The twins {{spent the}} {{majority}} {{of the rest of the}} year in tag team matches, regularly facing Kelly and Torres. The Bellas <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> friction for the second time since joining WWE in March 2012, after both twins lost to AJ Lee in singles competition. After Brie's match with Lee, Nikki revealed that Brie was rooting for Team Johnny in the 12-man tag team match at WrestleMania XXVIII, whilst Nikki was rooting for Team Teddy, thus furthering their dissension.|$|E
5|$|When Phillpotts's next comedy, Yellow Sands, was to {{be mounted}} at the Haymarket Theatre in the West End, Richardson {{and his wife were}} both cast in good roles. The play opened in November 1926 and ran until September 1928; with 610 {{performances}} it was the longest London run of Richardson's entire career. During the run Muriel Hewitt <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> early symptoms of encephalitis lethargica, a progressive and ultimately fatal illness.|$|E

5|$|With {{regard to}} {{television}} broadcasts, the film airs occasionally across the United States on networks such as TNT. To permit {{the scene where}} Jack draws the nude portrait of Rose to be shown on network and specialty cable channels, in addition to minor cuts, the sheer, see-through robe worn by Winslet was digitally painted black. Turner Classic Movies also <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the film, specifically during {{the days leading up}} to the 82nd Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|By July, {{development}} was behind schedule and Jarvis's superior began to pressure him {{to finish the}} game in time for an upcoming trade show, the AMOA, in September. Jarvis spent several weeks creating the astronauts, which his boss felt should be omitted if the process didn't speed up. The pressure frustrated him to the point he considered resigning. Around that time, a new programmer named Sam Dicker was hired. He assisted programming the game and added visual and audio effects. For example, Dicker implemented a particle effect algorithm to generate unique explosions for destroyed enemies. The new elements re-invigorated Jarvis, who felt the project <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> promise.|$|E
5|$|During 1946, {{the first}} full season after the war, Hammond played only 26 innings but scored 1,783 runs {{at an average of}} 84.90, topping the {{first-class}} averages for the eighth time in succession—still an English record as of 2015. At times, he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> technical weaknesses. Captaining England to a 1–0 victory in a three-Test series against India, he scored one fifty, making 119 runs at an average of 39.66. He batted fifth in the order in the final match, as he would in four of his five remaining Tests. Gloucestershire fell to fifth in the County Championship, and Hammond, after enthusiastically making the team very competitive {{at the start of the}} season, became increasingly affected by pain, particularly in damp weather. As captain, he could be irritable and consciously created remoteness and division.|$|E

5|$|He {{worked at}} Nintendo until 1996, {{when he left}} to work at other {{developers}} including Electronic Arts, Vivendi Games, Midway Games, and THQ. He established Partly Cloudy Games with friends around 2009, and , runs mobile games studio Carried Away Games. After following the fan community from afar, he came out to fans in mid 2012 and the press <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> greater interest in his work. He had planned {{to write a book}} about the game's development, release, and fandom as a Kickstarter project before a reply from Nintendo discouraged him from pursuing the idea.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{was born}} in Point Fortin, Trinidad and Tobago, to Lydia and Pamphile. and he {{attended}} St. Anthony's College in Trinidad along with his future Sunderland team-mate Carlos Edwards. His uncle, Philibert Jones was also a footballer as a prolific forward for Strike Squad that came within a point of qualifying for the 1990 World Cup and was a similar player to Kenwyne; both in style and celebration. His athleticism and pace, which Sunderland considered attractive, was not established until he joined Sheffield Wednesday in September and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> his potential.|$|E
5|$|Late on 7February, {{while still}} {{tracking}} to the east-southeast, Jasmine rapidly intensified, with wind speeds increasing to 185km/h (115mph), sustained for one minute. The cyclone developed a ragged eye stretching 40km (25mi) across. Later that day, Jasmine {{reached its peak}} intensity as it passed 280km (175mi) to the north-northeast of New Caledonia, with wind speeds of 215km/h (135mph), equivalent to a Category4 cyclone on both the Australian and Saffir-Simpson hurricane scales (SSHS). Throughout 8February, Jasmine <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> characteristics of an annular hurricane, maintaining a large, asymmetric eye and rather shallow convective features. In addition, multiple eyewall mesovorticies developed within the eye.|$|E
