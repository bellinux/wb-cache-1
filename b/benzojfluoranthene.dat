50|$|<b>Benzojfluoranthene</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the chemical formula C20H12. Classified as a {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH), it is a colourless solid that is poorly soluble in most solvents. Impure samples can appear off white. Closely related isomeric compounds include benzo(a)fluoranthene (BaF), benzo(b)fluoranthene (BbF), benzo(e)fluoranthene (BeF), and benzo(k)fluoranthene (BkF). BjF is present in fossil fuels and is released during incomplete combustion of organic matter. It has been traced in the smoke of cigarettes, exhaust from gasoline engines, emissions from the combustion of various types of coal and emissions from oil heating, {{as well as an}} impurity in some oils such as soybean oil. More than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, including the benzofluoranthenes.|$|E
