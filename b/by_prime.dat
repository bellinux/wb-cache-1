The findings of five studies demonstrate that person judgments may be affected not only <b>by</b> <b>priming</b> descriptively relevant traits, but also <b>by</b> <b>primes</b> that are antonyms of these traits. The direction of the effect of activating traits versus antonyms is dependent on (1) whether the trait inferences are descriptively relevant or irrelevant and evaluatively moderate or extreme, (2) whether they refer to behavior labels or person descriptions, and (3) whether they activate information that overlaps with the dimension on which the target is to be judged.

40|$|In the 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) rat {{model of}} Parkinson's disease, {{administration}} of a dopaminergic agonist sensitizes rats to a subsequent administration of dopaminergic drugs given days apart (priming). In situ hybridization {{was used to}} evaluate changes on striatal gene expression of rats primed three days previously with either L-dopa, SKF 38393 or quinpirole. Double labeling was used to identify the neuronal population in which such alterations occurred. GAD 67 and enkephalin mRNA were increased by the lesion whereas dynorphin mRNA was decreased as compared to the intact striatum. Priming with L-dopa and SKF 38393 significantly increased GAD 67 mRNA in the lesioned striatum and reversed dynorphin mRNA reduction, as compared to drug-naive rats, whereas quinpirole failed to produce any effect. Enkephalin mRNA was not affected <b>by</b> <b>priming.</b> Results suggest that 6 -OHDA lesion-induced adaptive changes on striatal gene expression are modified <b>by</b> <b>priming.</b> Priming brings striatal output neurons to a higher level of activity, which may explain the sensitized behavioral response observed following a dopaminergic agonist challenge. These changes are in relation to the different types of dopamine agonists utilized and suggest that modifications in gene expression induced <b>by</b> <b>priming</b> might be predictive of the dyskinetic potential of a dru...|$|R
