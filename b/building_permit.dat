However, the Public Roads Administration abandoned their plans and a <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> was issued. New changing rooms, club house and terraces were completed in September 1968.|$|E
5|$|On January 29, 1913, Calvin Shelverton {{applied for}} a <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> to {{construct}} the Piedmont Park Apartments. The apartments were designed by Leila Ross Wilburn and were decidedly middle-class unlike {{some of the other}} developments in the area. The apartments remained middle-class up until about 1960, and residents included such prominent Atlantans as accounting company president T. C. Dunlap and lawyer J. B. Stewart. In 1913, seven clay courts were built where the 1895 Cotton States and International Exposition's Manufacturers and Liberal Arts Building once was. Eight more courts were added in 1914 to accommodate the overwhelming demand.|$|E

25|$|A {{perennial}} {{debate in}} Evanston {{is the issue}} of Northwestern University's status as a tax-exempt institution. In the founding charter of Northwestern University, signed in 1851, the state granted the school an exemption from paying property taxes, and unlike other well-off private universities with statutory exemptions, it provides its own police services, but not firefighter/paramedic services. It pays water, sewer, communications, real property transfer taxes, and <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> fees, but not property taxes.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the commonly held {{view that the}} Census Bureau's monthly series for residential <b>building</b> <b>permits</b> issued is a leading indicator of the series for private housing starts. A close study of the residential <b>building</b> <b>permits</b> and housing starts series shows that on a quarterly basis the series are coincident, with cyclical peaks and troughts in the seasonally adjusted data occurring in the same period. On the monthly basis for the period 1960 through 1976, the peaks and troughs in the <b>building</b> <b>permits</b> series have usually followed those in the housing starts series. Also, evidence presented in the paper shows that monthly changes in the residential <b>building</b> <b>permits</b> series are not highly correlated with changes in the housing starts series one to five months in the future. Finally, the analysis suggests that changes in the backlog of unused residential <b>building</b> <b>permits</b> are not indicative of future changes {{in the rate of}} housing starts. The major implication of these results is that permits data offer little or no information about future month-to-month changes in the rate of housing starts. However, because the <b>building</b> <b>permits</b> series is less irregular than the housing starts series and the cyclical movements of the series are basically the same, permits data can be used to identify irregular monthly movements in the starts series.

The Harbour Commission rented trailers to use as temporary passenger facilities. The Federal Court rejected an injunction request from the City on March 30, 1990, clearing the way for new airlines to use the airport.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} dispute arose when the Catholic Archbishop of San Antonio, Patrick Flores, {{applied for a}} <b>{{building}}</b> <b>permit</b> to enlarge his 1923 mission-style St. Peter's Church in Boerne, Texas. The building was located in a historic district and considered a contributing property. Local zoning authorities denied the permit, citing an ordinance governing additions and new construction in a historic district. The Archbishop brought suit, challenging the ruling under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993. Flores argued that his congregation had outgrown the existing structure, rendering the ruling a substantial burden on {{the free exercise of}} religion without a compelling state interest.|$|E
25|$|Jarlsberg Luftsportssenter ENJB was {{incorporated}} on 7 March 1991 {{with the intention}} of renovating and potentially taking over the airport. The following year Solberg reported the aviation club to the police for illegal use of the airfield, but the issue was rejected. Solberg followed up by not renewing the operating certificate after it expired at the end of 1992, causing the airport to be closed. The runway was in this period used as a go-cart track. Jarlsberg Luftsportssenter received a <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> for new facilities, including an extension of the runway to , on 19 June 1993.

40|$|AbstractThe Egyptian Urban {{suffers from}} many {{negative}} aspects. This urban deterioration cannot {{be confined to}} a specific factor or a single reason, {{it may be because}} of the master plans itself, perhaps for reasons related to managing the urban development, or because of the process of issuing <b>building</b> <b>permits,</b> may be that the social environment is the reason, it can also be the financial policies, as well as the efficiency of local administrations employees, and the multiplicity of actors involved in the implementation process and the lack of coordination between them. The processes of development control and issuing <b>building</b> <b>permits</b> are important reasons in the problems facing the urban deterioration. To overcome most of these problems it is important to introduce a powerful technology that can be utilized in issuing <b>building</b> <b>permits.</b> GIS is an excellent choice for managing issuing <b>building</b> <b>permits.</b> The paper proposes a mechanism of an Information System to support and manage the <b>building</b> <b>permits</b> processes. It defines the user requirements and formulates the System Architecture, which identifies the essential components and processes, and their functional relationships. In order to introduce the proposed mechanism the following points were studied: 1. Identify the organizations involved in the process of issuing <b>building</b> <b>permits.</b> 2. Identify the needs and responsibilities of these organizations. 3. Identify the processes, inputs and outputs of each process. 4.

25|$|As part of {{independent}} Indonesia, Bogor {{has a significant}} role in the cultural, scientific and economic development of the country and West Java in particular – in part due to the legacy of infrastructure built during the colonial period. Its special position was further reinforced by the transformation of the former summer residence of the governor-general into the summer palace of the President of Indonesia. In the 1990s–2000s, the city regularly hosted various international events, such as ministry-level meetings of the Asia-Pacific institutions and the APEC summit of 15 November 1994.

In 1959, the community asked for a <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> to expand its synagogue, located {{in the basement of a}} Cape Cod-style house. The Ramapo town attorney requested condemnation of the entire New Square community, claiming that it threatened sewage lines. In response, the community requested incorporation as a village, but Ramapo town officials refused to allow it.

25|$|The {{choice of}} Jordal had the {{drawback}} of poor ground conditions {{and that the}} site was a hill. This was overcome by the architects Frode Rinnan and Olav Tveten by building the venue into the hill as an amphitheater, hence the name, along with a stage at the low end. Construction was budgeted to cost 2 million Norwegian krone (NOK), but construction cost NOK4 million. The overruns were largely caused by difficult ground conditions and the hillside location, with a more conventional location estimated to have halved the construction costs. Half a million krone were also spent because the venue used a year to receive a <b>building</b> <b>permit,</b> so the bulk of construction could not start until early 1951, a year after schedule, although preliminary construction started in August 1950. Jordal contributed to {{more than half the}} total cost overruns for the 1952 Winter Olympic venues.|$|E

Halberstam spent 15 years raising funds to build the hospital, which would come to be named Laniado Hospital, after the Laniado brothers, two bankers from Switzerland whose estate provided a $300,000 donation for the Rebbe. The hospital's first building, an outpatient clinic, opened in 1975. In the next few years, a maternity ward, emergency room, internal medicine department, a cardiology unit, and an intensive-care unit opened. The hospital continued to expand, and today encompasses two medical centers, a children’s hospital, a geriatric center and a nursing school, serving a regional population of over 450,000.

The airline was allowed free use of the aerodrome in exchange for the club having free use of a hangar at Værnes during the winter. From 1977 a law restricting motorized transport in the wilderness was passed, which severely limited the use of seaplanes and resulted in Trønderfly terminating its seaplane operations a few years later.|$|E
