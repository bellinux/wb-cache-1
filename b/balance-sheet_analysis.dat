40|$|There exist two {{streams of}} {{activity}} operating {{side by side}} with regard to the environment: urban and regional planning, and environmental protection. They have a common goal, the enhancement of man's environment. The first {{question is whether or not}} they should converge or diverge; this being answered affirmatively, then the question is how? This is considered in relation to control over the development of projects. Advanced practice is reviewed here, and then how practice could be improved by environmental impact analysis being matured into development-impact analysis with impact being seen as three sequential aspects: physical, activity, and welfare. The conclusions can then be translated into planning analysis, through the use of planning <b>balance-sheet</b> <b>analysis,</b> aimed at drawing a conclusion which is more suitable for decisionmaking than the conventional environmental impact analysis. The merging of the two streams would both sharpen the use of environmental impact analysis as currently practised and raise the level of performance of conventional planning analysis. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} to generate value-added services {{in order to}} acquire and retain loyal clients {{is one of the}} challenges facing the hospitality sector. For this reason and because of economic realities and government policies, an ever-growing number of hotels are formally adopting certified environmental practices such as the ISO 14001. In this article, we attempt to analyze the relationship between the implementation of a proactive environmental management tool, the ISO 14001 standard, and the generation of economic revenues in the Spanish hotel industry. Also considered are the possible effects on the business results of moderating factors such as company size and the market segment where the hotel operates. Empirical economic information on 2, 116 Spanish hotels was obtained from the SABI database (Iberian <b>Balance-Sheet</b> <b>Analysis</b> System) for the year 2008, during which 108 properties had ISO 14001 certification. Quantitative analysis techniques showed significant differences in the economic performance of ISO-certified hotels and those not certified, particularly for urban and beach hotels. The results showed influence of both company size and organizational factors on revenue. Only small rural hotels saw no difference in revenues due to {{the presence or absence of}} ISO certification...|$|E
40|$|Bank {{balance-sheet}} management {{which involves}} {{the determination of}} the size and composition of a bank's assets and liabilities over a multiperiod planning horizon {{is one of the most}} prominent issues in bank strategic planning. Not only management policy choices, but legal restrictions and minimum safety requirements, dictated by the economic and political environment operated in, mean a balance has to be struck between the conflicting objectives of profitability, liquidity and risk. Bank balance-sheet management is further complicated by the fact that decisions made at any point in time affect profits, liquidity and risk, not only at the time they are made, but in the periods that follow. This paper discusses a multiperiod linear programming model constructed for a commercial bank in Turkey, that takes into consideration this systematic relationship in the legal, financial and institutional setup of Turkey over the period 1987 - 1990. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrate the relevance of the model for informed policy choice, and the use of the model as a planning tool. linear programming banking policy <b>analysis</b> <b>balance-sheet</b> management...|$|R
25|$|Risk {{management}} involves {{analyzing the}} market and credit risk that an investment bank or its clients take onto their balance sheet during transactions or trades. Credit risk focuses around capital markets activities, such as syndicated loans, bond issuance, restructuring, and leveraged finance. Market risk conducts review of sales and trading activities utilizing the VaR model and provide hedge-fund solutions to portfolio managers. Other risk groups include country risk, operational risk, and counterparty risks {{which may or may}} not exist on a bank to bank basis. Credit risk solutions are key part of capital market transactions, involving debt structuring, exit financing, loan amendment, project finance, leveraged buy-outs, and sometimes portfolio hedging. Front office market risk activities provide service to investors via derivative solutions, portfolio management, portfolio consulting, and risk advisory. Well-known risk groups in JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays engage in revenue-generating activities involving debt structuring, restructuring, syndicated loans, and securitization for clients such as corporates, governments, and hedge funds. J.P. Morgan IB Risk works with investment banking to execute transactions and advise investors, although its Finance & Operation risk groups focus on middle office functions involving internal, non-revenue generating, operational risk controls. Credit default swap, for instance, is a famous credit risk hedging solution for clients invented by J.P. Morgan's Blythe Masters during the 1990s. The Loan Risk Solutions group within Barclays' investment banking division and Risk Management and Financing group housed in Goldman Sach's securities division are client-driven franchises. However, risk management groups such as operational risk, internal risk control, and legal risk are restrained to internal business functions including firm <b>balance-sheet</b> risk <b>analysis</b> and assigning trading cap that are independent of client needs, even though these groups may be responsible for deal approval that directly affects capital market activities. Risk management is a broad area, and like research, its roles can be client-facing or internal.|$|R
40|$|<b>Balance-sheet</b> <b>analysis</b> (BSA) {{complements}} traditional flow-oriented macroeconomic {{analysis by}} gauging mismatches in aggregate and sectoral balance sheets of an economy. Enabled by recent progress in data availability, this paper applies BSA to Georgia, focusing on currency mismatches. In reviewing developments {{over the last}} five years, the paper finds that the still-high level of dollarization continues to create financial vulnerabilities, but that the overall level of currency mismatch has fallen and that liquidity problems are unlikely, in part owing to a strengthening of sectoral buffers, hedges, and insurance against shocks. Policy recommendations include accumulating reserves, strengthening securities markets, enhancing banking supervision, and maintaining a flexible exchange rate.
