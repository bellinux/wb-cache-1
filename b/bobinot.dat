To know nothing, or little, is {{in the nature of}} some husbands. To hide, in the nature of how many women? Oh, ladies! how many of you have surreptitious milliners' bills? How many of you have gowns and bracelets which you daren't show, or which you wear trembling?--trembling, and coaxing with smiles the husband by your side, who does not know the new velvet gown from the old one, or the new bracelet from last year's, or has any notion that the ragged-looking yellow lace scarf cost forty guineas and that Madame <b>Bobinot</b> is writing dunning letters every week for the money! ...|$|E

Therefore, the two decide {{to remain at}} the store until the storm passes. <b>Bobinôt</b> then decides to buy a can of shrimp for his wife, Calixta, while he waits with his son for the storm to abate.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, back {{at their}} house, <b>Bobinôt's</b> wife, Calixta is so {{occupied}} with her sewing {{that at first}} she does not notice the ominous clouds or thunder. Finally, she notices that it is growing darker outside so she decides to shut the windows and retrieve <b>Bobinôt's</b> and Bibi's clothes which are hanging outside. Then Alcée, one of Calixta's former beaus, rides {{up to the house}} and asks if he can stay there until the storm is over.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{critics have}} argued that [...] "The Storm" [...] narrows in on the topics of gender and some {{view it as a}} sin {{committed}} between two [...] "ex" [...] lovers. As Maria Herbert-Leiter suggested, “through this story, Chopin seems to be arguing for human passion and desire, but not at the cost of marriage. After all, the two couples end where they began—happily married. Furthermore, Calixta’s concerns for <b>Bobinôt’s</b> physical dryness and Clarisse’s continued devotion to her husband prove the solidity of the marriages that are tested in this story.” ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Bobinôt</b> and Bibi {{return from}} {{the grocery store and}} Calixta {{immediately}} embraces them. <b>Bobinôt</b> presents his gift of the can of shrimp to his wife and she remarks that they will feast that night. Meanwhile, Alcée writes a loving letter to his wife, Clarisse, and encourages her to stay in Biloxi with their children as long as she needs. He notes that their well-being {{is more important than the}} separation anxiety that he endures. Clarisse is [...] "charmed" [...] by the letter and is happy in Biloxi because she feels free, as if she were a maiden again. She explains how although she is devoted to her husband; she isn't in a rush to go back to her married life. The story ends with the short line, [...] "So the storm passed and every one was happy".|$|E
50|$|The storm {{also points}} out the direct issues with {{marriage}} at the time. Calixta appears lonely and depressed {{in the beginning of}} the story, but by the time <b>Bobinot</b> comes home from waiting out the storm, she receives a can of shrimps upon arrival and by this small gesture a marriage could be rekindled.|$|E
5000|$|The 'Cadian Ball is a soirée {{for young}} Cajun {{people to find}} {{marriage}} suitors. Calixta is the belle of the ball and describes the young men as boring and plain looking. The only man she finds attractive is Alcée. They sneak off together and discuss their former relationship. Clarisse, whom Alcée was originally courting, had refused to accept him, but after seeing him leave for the ball, she follows and asks Alcée to come with her, claiming that [...] "something terrible has happened." [...] After leading him away, she admits that nothing has happened, but that she {{is in love with}} him. Calixta ends up with <b>Bobinôt,</b> a man she is not very attracted to, but someone she will settle for.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Storm" [...] is a {{short story}} that takes place during the 19th century in Louisiana. Chopin's protagonist Calixta is portrayed as the typical housewife, as she was sowing and tending to <b>Bobinot</b> and Bibi's clothes. Throughout the story there are many {{symbolic}} references. It is said that the storm symbolizes the passion and affair that happens between Calixta and Alcée. As soon as Calixta goes outside to get Bibi and Bobinot's clothes off the line and the storm approaches, so does Alcée seeking shelter from the storm. In an article of [...] "The Storm", it says: [...] "as the storm is just about to arrive, so too does Alcée to Calixta’s home and as the storm begins {{to have an effect}} on the surroundings of the house, likewise Calixta and Alcée become closer (physically) eventually sleeping with each other." [...] As the storm climaxes and ceases so does the affair with Calixta and Alcée. At the end of the storm the narrators says: [...] "the storm past and everyone was happy". They both experienced that intense passion that their relationship was missing.|$|E
5000|$|Chopin {{describes}} Calixta as, [...] "a little fuller {{of figure}} {{than five years}} before when she married; but she had lost nothing of her vivacity." [...] (par. 12). The reader can infer that Calixta is basically unchanged since being married. Kate Chopin is trying to highlight the fact that being married doesn't really change a woman if there's no passion and fulfillment involved in it. In the article, [...] "The Kaleidoscope of Truth: A New Look at Chopin's 'The Storm'", Allen Stein explains how some people believe that Chopin supports and defends Calixta's affair {{as an act of}} human nature and that women deserve to fulfill to their sexual desires. Chopin is trying to say that Calixta had something missing from her life all these years that <b>Bobinôt</b> couldn't provide for her and Alcée was able to give Calixta that missing piece when they had sex. Chopin believes that this act isn't sinful because every woman deserves to know about passion and have sexual fulfillment in their lives. This is evident when Chopin writes, [...] "Calixta's firm, elastic flesh that was knowing for the first time its birthright" [...] (par.25) By saying it's Calixta's birthright to have sex, it further proves Chopin's approval of this [...] "sinful" [...] act.|$|E
