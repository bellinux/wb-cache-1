25|$|When <b>buffing</b> {{there are}} two types of <b>buffing</b> motions: the cut motion and the color motion. The cut motion is {{designed}} to give a uniform, smooth, semi-bright surface finish. This is achieved by moving the workpiece against the rotation of the <b>buffing</b> wheel, while using medium to hard pressure. The color motion gives a clean, bright, shiny surface finish. This is achieved by moving the workpiece with the rotation of the <b>buffing</b> wheel, while using medium to light pressure.|$|E
25|$|Polishing {{knives and}} cutlery {{is known as}} fine glazing or blue glazing. Sand <b>buffing,</b> when used on German silver, white metal, etc., is {{technically}} a <b>buffing</b> operation because it uses a loose abrasive, but removes {{a significant amount of}} material, like polishing.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 15-16 mm. The forewings are sepia, {{with warm}} <b>buff</b> {{points on the}} costa and two warm <b>buff</b> patches obliquely on {{the lower half of}} the wing, one antemedially and the other just before the postmedial line. There is a warm <b>buff</b> spot between the two. The postmedial fascia consists of a fine, wavy, warm <b>buff</b> line from the costa to vein 2. The hindwings are sepia with a warm <b>buff</b> patch at the base. The medial fascia is oblique, waved and warm <b>buff</b> and the postmedial fascia is oblique and warm <b>buff.</b>|$|R
25|$|Polishing wheels, {{also known}} as <b>buffing</b> wheels or {{polishing}} mops, use a specific electric tool to physically remove tarnish from the surface rather than chemically as with the calcium carbonate slurry or commercial dips.|$|E
25|$|Potassium cyanide is a {{compound}} with the formula KCN. This colorless crystalline salt, similar in appearance to sugar, is highly soluble in water. Most KCN {{is used in}} gold mining, organic synthesis, and electroplating. Smaller applications include jewelry for chemical gilding and <b>buffing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Along with <b>buffing</b> wheels, {{particular}} compounds {{are used}} to help polish the material. Two main types of compounds used for silver and gold surfaces are red and blue compounds. Red, also known as jeweler's rouge, polishes without any cutting action. The blue compound is a dryer compound and is used with a grease-less wheel that also does not cut or scratch the surface.|$|E

25|$|Polishing {{may be used}} {{to enhance}} and restore the looks of certain metal parts or object on cars and other vehicles, handrails, cookware, kitchenware, and {{architectural}} metal. In other applications such as pharmaceutical, dairy, and specialty plumbing, pipes are buffed to help prevent corrosion and to eliminate locations where bacteria or mold may reside. <b>Buffing</b> is also used to manufacture light reflectors.|$|E
25|$|Several {{products}} {{have been developed}} for the purpose of polishing silver that serve to remove sulfur from the metal without damaging or warping it. Because harsh polishing and <b>buffing</b> can permanently damage and devalue a piece of antique silver, valuable items are typically hand-polished to preserve the unique patinas of older pieces. Techniques such as wheel polishing, which are typically performed by professional jewelers or silver repair companies, are reserved for extreme tarnish or corrosion.|$|E
500|$|The {{blade profile}} of most CQC-6's is a Japanese chisel ground tant≈ç {{with a single}} bevel or zero-ground blade {{sharpened}} on only one side. [...] Early models have a buffline similar to a hamon found on a Japanese Samurai Sword due to a leather <b>buffing</b> wheel used by Emerson to finish his blades. [...] Unlike the typical Japanese chisel-grind, Emerson's grind is on the left-side of the blade {{as opposed to the}} right-side.|$|E

500|$|Shoe polish {{is applied}} to the shoe using a rag, cloth, or brush. Shoe polish is not a {{cleaning}} product, and therefore the footwear should be both clean and dry before application. A vigorous rubbing action to apply the polish evenly on the boot, followed by further <b>buffing</b> with a clean dry cloth or brush, usually provides good results. Another technique, known as spit-polishing or bull polishing, involves gently rubbing polish into the leather with a cloth and a drop of water or spit. This achieves the mirror-like, high-gloss finish sometimes known as a spit shine or bull which is especially valued in military organizations. Despite the term, saliva is less commonly used as the vehicle or diluent with polish than is water. [...] Polishes containing carnauba wax {{can be used as a}} protective coating to extend the life and look of a leather shoe.|$|E
500|$|In his 1994 {{proposal}} to Origin, {{he described the}} concept as [...] "Underworld-style first-person action" [...] in a real world setting with [...] "big-budget, nonstop action" [...] starring an ex-cop [...] "security specialist". He described the project as [...] "high" [...] risk for its [...] "technological unknowns" [...] as [...] "probably the toughest project on his wish list". It failed to get to production. He later left Origin for Looking Glass Technologies near {{the time that they}} were producing , but kept the idea in mind. For Thief, he tried to suggest <b>buffing</b> the character more so that the player could opt to fight through levels instead of sneaking, the original intent of the game, but the team didn't take to these ideas. He continued to change his character and game system plans for Troubleshooter, though the game he then called Junction Point did not reach production at Looking Glass. Spector wrote that the timing was not yet ripe because the business teams were not interested, the technology was not yet feasible, he did not have an interested team or the resources to make one, and that publishers did not want a [...] "first-person, cross-genre game". Spector, himself, was also tired of unrealistic fantasy and alien settings. Frustrated at Looking Glass, Spector sought employment elsewhere and was nearly about to sign a contract with Electronic Arts, when John Romero of Ion Storm approached him. When Romero offered him a chance to make his [...] "dream game" [...] without any restrictions, Spector was immediately on board.|$|E
2500|$|Polishing and <b>buffing</b> are {{finishing}} {{processes for}} smoothing a workpiece's surface using an abrasive and a work wheel or a leather [...] strop. Technically polishing refers to processes that use an abrasive that is {{glued to the}} work wheel, while <b>buffing</b> uses a loose abrasive applied to the work wheel. Polishing is a more aggressive process while <b>buffing</b> is less harsh, {{which leads to a}} smoother, brighter finish. A common misconception is that a polished surface has a mirror bright finish, however most mirror bright finishes are actually buffed.|$|E

2500|$|Because silver is soft, [...] {{the surface}} {{can be easily}} cut or scratched. The main <b>buffing</b> type used for silver, gold, and plated objects is Canton flannel. This flannel is made of very soft {{material}} and will not scratch the plated, lacquered, or other soft surfaces.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Buffing</b> wheels, {{also known}} as mops, are either made from cotton or wool cloth and come {{bleached}} or unbleached. Specific types include: [...] sisal, spiral sewn, loose cotton, canton flannel, domet flannel, denim, treated spiral sewn, cushion, treated vented, untreated vented, string buff, finger buff, sisal rope, mushroom, facer, tampered, scrubbing mushroom, hourglass buff, rag, [...] "B", climax, swansdown, airflow, coolair, and bullet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{condition}} of the material at hand determines what type of abrasive will be applied. The first stage, if the material is unfinished, starts with a rough abrasive (perhaps 60 or 80 grit) and each subsequent stage uses a finer abrasive, such as 120, 180, 220/240, 320, 400 and higher grit abrasives, until the desired finish is achieved. The rough (i.e. large grit) passes remove imperfections within the metal surface like pits, nicks, lines and scratches. The finer abrasives leave progressively finer lines that are not {{visible to the naked}} eye. To achieve a #8 Finish (Mirror) it requires polishing and <b>buffing</b> compounds, polishing wheels and high speed polishing machines or other machine tools {{that can be used for}} polishing, like an electrical drill. Lubricants like wax and kerosene may be used as lubricating and cooling media during these operations, although some polishing materials are specifically designed to be used [...] "dry." [...] <b>Buffing</b> may be done by hand with a stationary polisher or die grinder, or it may be automated using specialized equipment.|$|E

2500|$|Mechanical surface treatments. Several {{types of}} {{mechanical}} surface treatments exist. Mill finishes are derived by normal production processes, such as rolling, extrusion, or casting. [...] "Buffeted" [...] finishes impart bright mirror-like appearances after grinding, polishing, and <b>buffing.</b> [...] "Directional textured" [...] finishes provide a smooth, velvety satin sheen {{in a continuous}} pattern of fine nearly parallel scratches. [...] "Non-directional textured matte" [...] finishes achieve a rough texture, primarily on castings, as spray sand or metal shot are applied under high pressure. And [...] "patterned" [...] finishes, made by pressing a copper alloy sheet between two rolls, produce a textured and embossed look.|$|E
2500|$|The player {{controls}} {{up to four}} squads, each led by one of {{the major}} human characters in the game with summoned demons as their supporting units; most of the enemies faced in the game are either squads of demons or a demon tamer with their own summoned demons.

For demons, new abilities are learned either through leveling up, being trained a new ability by the player after defeating a certain number of enemies, or as a result of [...] "fusion", inheriting the ability from one of the two demons used in the fusion. The player's human characters gain these by [...] "skill cracking" [...] abilities from the demons or other opponents they face; to crack a skill, the player must target a specific skill from a specific unit on the field for each human character before battle, and then defeat that unit with that character's squad. Once cracked, the player can assign these skills across all of their parties' human characters.|$|E
