5000|$|Production of the 4-door, 5-seat A8-16 series {{began in}} 1981. The design {{concept of the}} A8-16 was largely {{inspired}} by the SAAB and Volvo models including the ground breaking 1970s Volvo VESC safety concept car, with futuristic details such as the large headlamps, inclined nose and the high-positioned rear trunk - traits that were particularly associated with SAAB models. However, it also had details that appeared [...] "retro" [...] in 1981, such as the rear lights which originally belonged to BÃ¶cek, but didn't look good on the A8-16. The interior design and the materials used also did not please the traditional Anadol customers. Many of the design characteristics, especially the door windows and frames, were borrowed from older Anadol models such as the SV-1600 which was designed in 1973, and most potential customers saw this car as a hodge-podge of old Anadol spare parts, mixed with some new ideas. The new body still sat on a <b>box-type</b> perimeter <b>frame</b> with crossmembers, with independent coil sprung front suspension and a live, leafsprung rear axle. Steering is rack and pinion, transmission by {{the way of a}} four-speed manual.|$|R
40|$|Both {{kinds of}} {{asymmetry}} arises from interference of Born amplitude and the ampltude with two virtual photons exchange ones (<b>box-type</b> one). In <b>frames</b> of structureless proton approximation we calculate the one-spin asymmetry for elastic electron-polarized proton scattering. The similar consideration is {{given for the}} crossed process of proton antiproton (electron positron) pair creation at electron - positron (proton antiproton) annihilation with polarized proton. For the case of unpolarized particles we obtain the charge-odd correlation which {{can be measured in}} combination of electron proton and positron-proton scattering experiments. The similar quantity forward-backward asimmetry can be measured for the crossed processes. Using the reasons of analiticity we show that the effect of proton form factors almost compensate the contribution of inelastic intermediate states,which support out structure less proton assumption. Errors caused by these asuumptions are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The lyre, {{borrowed}} from the Greeks, was not a harp, but instead had a sounding body of wood or a tortoise shell covered with skin, and arms of animal horn or wood, with strings stretched from a cross bar to the sounding body. The lyre was held or cradled in one arm and hand and plucked with the other hand. The Romans gradually abandoned this instrument in favour of the more sophisticated cithara, a larger instrument with a <b>box-type</b> <b>frame</b> with strings stretched from the cross-bar at the top to the sounding box at the bottom; it was held upright and played with a plectrum. The strings were tuned [...] "by adjusting sticks seen in the engraving." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dean Moon, {{dry lake}} racer {{and founder of}} MOON Speed Equipment, built a Devin-bodied special called Moonbeam in {{partnership}} with NHRA president Wally Parks. The car {{was meant to be}} {{the first of a series}} of cars optimized for straight-line runs on the drag strip and the Bonneville salt flats. A <b>box-type</b> <b>frame</b> was fabricated from mild steel tubing by Harley Klentz. The chassis had a track width of 50 in and a nominal wheelbase of 100 in, but the wheelbase could be adjusted by up to 4 in. Front and rear axles were both solid, with the front being an I-beam unit from a Ford and the rear also being Ford but with a Halibrand quick-change center. Suspension was done by Monroe coil-over shock absorbers and the axles were located by trailing arms and a Watt's linkage. Brakes were Mercury-Bendix and the wheels were magnesium Halibrands. The first engine used was a [...] Chevrolet small-block V8 with a GMC 4-71 Roots-type supercharger blowing through a Potvin intake manifold and Hilborn fuel injection. When this engine did not perform as expected, it was replaced with a [...] Chevrolet.|$|E
