5|$|The <b>bananaquit</b> {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird. It has a slender, curved bill, {{adapted to}} taking nectar from flowers. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Coereba (Vieillot, 1809) and is normally placed within the family Thraupidae.|$|E
5|$|The {{avifauna}} of the West Indies {{is predominantly}} of tropical North American (southern North America and Central America) origin with aggressive South American species having colonized the area only recently. The South American families {{occurring in the}} Greater Antilles are the hummingbirds (Trochilidae), tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae), <b>bananaquit</b> (Coerebidae) and tanagers (Thraupidae), {{all of which are}} represented in Puerto Rico. The prevailing theory suggests that bird fauna colonized the West Indies by transoceanic dispersal during the glacial periods of the Pleistocene. The most primitive West Indies birds are the todies which have an endemic representative in Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rican tody.|$|E
25|$|In the Caribbean 600 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} of which 163 are endemic such as the tody, Fernandina's flicker and palmchat. The American yellow warbler is found in many areas as is the green heron. Of the endemic species 48 are threatened with extinction including the Puerto Rican amazon, yellow-breasted crake and the Zapata wren. According to Birdlife International in 2006 in Cuba 29 species of bird {{are in danger of}} extinction and two species officially extinct. The black-fronted piping guan is endangered as is the plain pigeon. The Antilles along with Central America lie in the flight path of migrating birds from North America so the size of populations is subject to seasonal fluctuations. In the forests are found parrots, <b>bananaquit</b> and toucans. Over the open sea can be seen frigatebirds and tropicbirds.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that selection on melanocortin- 1 -receptor (MC 1 R) polymorphism, a common cause of melanic colour variation in vertebrates, results from pleiotropic effects of the gene in the immune system. Here we present the first test of whether MC 1 R variation is associated with differences in parasite abundance in a natural population. <b>Bananaquits</b> (Coereba flaveola) (Linnaeus, 1758) living on Grenada in the Caribbean exhibit a melanic plumage dimorphism {{as a result of a}} mutation in MC 1 R. The proportion of black individuals increases clinally towards the central, wetter parts of the island. We captured <b>bananaquits</b> through the cline and quantified parasite abundances. Avian malaria, feather mites, and mallophaga lice varied significantly in abundance across the cline; however, neither these infections, nor coccidia, nor arboviruses showed overall differences between the morphs. Feather mites tended to be more abundant on black individuals, in areas where the black morph was more common. This may result from differences in microhabitat use by the two morphs. These patterns do not support the idea that MC 1 R variation in itself results in differing susceptibility to parasites. © 2013 The Linnean Society of Londo...|$|R
50|$|Other animals also visit hummingbird feeders. Bees, wasps, and ants are {{attracted}} to the sugar-water and may crawl into the feeder, where they may become trapped and drown. Orioles, woodpeckers, <b>bananaquits,</b> raccoons and other larger animals are known to drink from hummingbird feeders, sometimes tipping them and draining the liquid. In the southwestern United States, two species of nectar-drinking bats (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae and Choeronycteris mexicana) visit hummingbird feeders to supplement their natural diet of nectar and pollen from saguaro cacti and agaves.|$|R
50|$|In {{particular}} {{during the}} breeding season, {{most of the}} prey are smallish birds weighing 10 - 40 g. Almost any such species will be taken, with local preferences for whatever is most abundant—be it larks (Alaudidae), pipits (Anthus) or house sparrows (Passer domesticus)—and inexperienced s always a favorite. Smaller birds will generally avoid a hunting merlin if possible. In the Cayman Islands (where it only occurs in winter), <b>bananaquits</b> were noted to die of an apparent heart attack or stroke, without being physically harmed, when a merlin went at them and they could not escape.|$|R

Full details on the occurrence of Coereba flaveola in the group of Netherlands Leeward Islands (Aruba, Curaçao, and Bonaire) will be found in my forthcoming monograph on the birds of these islands, in the 7 th volume of these Studies, {{as well as in the}} above mentioned book...|$|R
25|$|Although {{hummingbirds}} are {{the most}} familiar nectar-feeding birds for North Americans, there are analogous species {{in other parts of}} the world: sunbirds, honeyeaters, flowerpeckers, honeycreepers, <b>bananaquits,</b> flowerpiercers, lories and lorikeets. Hummingbirds are the oldest group, with the greatest degree of specialization on nectar. Flowers attractive to hummingbirds that can hover in front of the flower tend to be large red or orange tubes with a lot of dilute nectar, secreted during the day. Since birds do not have a strong response to scent, they tend to be odorless. Perching birds need a substantial landing platform, so sunbirds, honeyeaters, and the like are less associated with tubular flowers.|$|R
50|$|Poitea carinalis {{is a small}} {{deciduous}} tree of dry shrub {{and when}} in flower, usually February-April (occasionally up to June, depending on dry season rains), an individual Poitea (Sabinea) {{can be seen from}} a mile away as the entire tree turns brilliant red, the flowers have the typical pea form with a long keel. Scattered individuals occur throughout the dry shrub and are occasionally planted elsewhere and since it has been adopted as the national flower of Dominica, people are now encouraged to plant it more widely. The flowers appear just before the new leaves unfurl and attract an abundance of insects, hummingbirds and <b>bananaquits,</b> but last for only a short time. Out of flower, it has 6-8 pairs of leaflets and a flattened pod. It is endemic to Dominica (one related species in Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands).|$|R
2500|$|Birds include toucans, {{black-necked aracari}} (Pteroglossus aracari), hummingbirds, Amazon {{kingfisher}} (Chloroceryle amazona), collared puffbird (Bucco capensis), great kiskadee (Pitangus sulphuratus), cream-colored woodpecker (Celeus flavus), neotropic [...] cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus), anhinga (Anhinga anhinga), <b>bananaquit</b> (Coereba flaveola), plain parakeet (Brotogeris tirica), great egret (Ardea alba), barn owl (Tyto alba), laughing falcon (Herpetotheres cachinnans), bat falcon (Falco rufigularis), southern lapwing (Vanellus chilensis), pauraque (Nyctidromus albicollis), wattled jacana (Jacana jacana), chestnut-bellied seed finch (Oryzoborus angolensis) and tropical screech owl (Megascops choliba).|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to many frogs, {{which lay}} their eggs in water, coquís {{lay their eggs}} on palm tree leaves or other {{terrestrial}} plants. Abandoned bird nests are also used as nests by E. coqui. The <b>bananaquit,</b> Puerto Rican bullfinch and Puerto Rican tody share nests with the coquí. This method of reproduction allows the coquí to live in forests, mountains and other habitats without direct dependency on water. Since eggs are laid on land, coquís bypass the tadpole stage, proceeding to develop limbs within their eggs, rather than going through a metamorphosis as a larva in water. Thus, a fully independent froglet emerges from the egg, with a small tail that is lost shortly after. [...] This stage of direct development has allowed the coqui to become a successful terrestrial colonizer in tropical areas.|$|E
50|$|The New World warblers {{are closely}} related to the tanagers, and some species like the conebills Conirostrum and the <b>bananaquit</b> have been placed into either group by {{different}} authorities. Currently, the conebills are normally placed in Thraupidae and the <b>bananaquit</b> in its own family.|$|E
5000|$|The term ornithophily {{is used to}} {{describe}} pollination specifically by birds. Hummingbirds, found only in North and South America, are the most recognized nectar-eating bird, {{but there are many}} other bird species throughout the world that are also important pollinators. These include: sunbirds, honeyeaters, flowerpeckers, honeycreepers, and <b>bananaquits</b> (University of Connecticut 2006). Plants pollinated by birds often have brightly colored diurnal flowers that are red, yellow, or orange, but no odor because birds have a poor sense of smell. Other characteristics of these plants are that they have suitable, sturdy places for perching, abundant nectar that is deeply nested within the flower. Often flowers are elongated or tube shaped. Also, many plants have anthers placed in the flower so that pollen rubs against the birds head/back as the bird reaches in for nectar (Celebrating Wildlife 2006).|$|R
40|$|Hurricanes {{have been}} assumed {{to reduce the}} {{reproduction}} of plants, either directly by leaf stripping and stress or indirectly by reducing pollinators. I examined the pollination and fruit set of a common shrub, Bourreria succulenta, after hurricanes on San Salvador island, Bahamas. Contrary to the assumption of resource limitation, B. succulenta showed unusually prolific flowering after Hurricane Lili stripped leaves {{from most of the}} plants in October 1996. I predicted that the abundant flowering would saturate pollinators and that fruit set would be pollination-limited. Fruit set was strongly pollination-limited by 71 percent. Butterflies are probably the major pollinators and were present at the site, but they rarely visited B. succulenta flowers even though flowers were brimming with nectar. Nectarivorous birds (<b>Bananaquits</b> and Bahama Wbodstars) visit B. succulenta flowers, but their populations were decimated by Hurricane Lili and they rarely visited flowers during this time. Fruit set was also severely predation-limited; a moth caterpillar (Gelechiidae) was extremely abundant and ate buds, flowers, and fruits, causing a further 68 percent reduction in fruit set. Together, pollination limitation and predation limitation reduced fruit set to only 7 percent or less. Predation was also intense in 1999 after Hurricane Floyd and resulted in 11 percent fruit set or less. Whether or not hurricanes were the cause of limited pollinators or abundant predators, the resulting low fruit set could have population effects because hurricanes can provide opportunities for the recruitment of new plants. These results emphasize that understanding plant–animal interactions may be necessary for predicting the effects of hurricanes on plant reproductive success, which may affect subsequent recruitment. Species on small islands like San Salvador (150 km 2) with relatively few species may be especially vulnerable to environmental disturbances such as hurricanes...|$|R

50|$|The <b>bananaquit</b> (Coereba flaveola) is {{a species}} of {{passerine}} bird of uncertain relation. It is tentatively placed in the tanager family, but classified as incertae sedis by other authorities such as the American Ornithologists' Union. Its classification is debated, and it is often placed in its own family: Coerebidae. It has recently been suggested the <b>bananaquit</b> should be split into three species, but this has yet to receive widespread recognition. This small, active nectarivore is found in warmer parts of the Americas, and is generally common.|$|E
50|$|Known {{hosts of}} this species include the <b>bananaquit</b> (Coereba flaveola), orangequit (Euneornis campestris), yellow-shouldered grassquit (Loxipasser anoxanthus), the large toucan (Ramphastos toco) and the black-faced grassquit (Tiaris bicolor).|$|E
50|$|This {{species was}} {{formerly}} {{placed in the}} family Coerebidae with the <b>bananaquit</b> and honeycreepers. It has sometimes been considered to be conspecific with the cinnamon-bellied flowerpiercer, D. baritula.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} territorial bird of the U.S.V.I. is the <b>bananaquit,</b> {{which is}} also depicted in the Seal of the United States Virgin Islands. Besides the <b>bananaquit,</b> {{there are more than}} 140 other species of birds, including for instance pelicans, parrots, parakeets, flamingos, herons, egrets, hummingbirds, sea gulls, doves, ospreys, kingfishers and warblers. The island of Saint Croix has several species of animals endemic to the island, including the Saint Croix ground lizard, the Saint Croix's anole, as well as the extinct Saint Croix racer and Saint Croix macaw.|$|E
50|$|Most {{subspecies}} of the <b>bananaquit</b> have dark grey (almost black) upperparts, black {{crown and}} sides of the head, a prominent white eyestripe, grey throat, white vent, and yellow chest, belly and rump.|$|E
50|$|The spindalises were {{traditionally}} considered aberrant tanagers of {{the family}} Thraupidae, but like the equally enigmatic <b>bananaquit</b> (Coereba flaveola), they are often treated as incertae sedis (place uncertain) among the nine-primaried oscines.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bananaquit</b> {{is known}} for its ability to adjust remarkably to human environments. It often visits gardens and may become very tame. Its nickname, the sugar bird, comes from its {{affinity}} for bowls or bird feeders stocked with granular sugar, a common method of attracting these birds. The <b>bananaquit</b> builds a spherical lined nest with a side entrance hole, laying up to three eggs, which are incubated solely by the female. It may also build its nest in human-made objects, such as lampshades and garden trellises. The birds breed all year regardless of season and build new nests throughout the year.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bananaquit</b> {{is a small}} bird, {{although}} there is some degree of size variation across the various subspecies. Length can range from 4 to 5 in. Weight ranges from 5.5 to 19 g.|$|E
50|$|Red {{and blue}} stripes compose the {{traditional}} shirt of the team. It is also nicknamed El Ciclón Bananero (The <b>Bananaquit</b> Cyclone), based in San Lorenzo de Almagro, {{which is also}} based its uniform.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bananaquit</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Certhia flaveola. It was reclassified {{as the only}} member of the genus Coereba by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1809. Prior to 2005, the <b>bananaquit</b> was assigned to the monotypic family Coerebidae; there is currently no agreement to which family it belongs; some authors place it into the Emberizidae. Since recent studies have shed some light on the bananaquit's affinities, many authorities consider Coerebidae an obsolete taxon. The Coerebidae used to contain other nectar-eating birds from the tropical Americas, but these have since been moved. The <b>bananaquit</b> is part of a group that includes Darwin's finches, Tiaris (grassquits), Loxigilla, etc.—most of which were previously placed in Emberizidae, but are now known to actually be part of the Thraupidae. As such this species is tentatively placed in the family Thraupidae unless a study suggests more accurate placement. Nevertheless, its precise relations remain unresolved, so the American Ornithologists' Union classes it as a species incertae sedis.|$|E
50|$|On 15 February 2013, the American Ornithologists' Union marked {{this species}} in their {{database}} as a taxonomic synonym to the incertae sedis family containing the <b>bananaquit.</b> No explanation was given, {{and it would}} seem {{this may have been}} a mistake.|$|E
50|$|There are few {{species of}} {{terrestrial}} birds on the island, {{probably due to}} the large number of reptile predators. The most common include endemic subspecies of black-crowned antshrike (Thamnophilus atrinucha gorgonae), <b>bananaquit</b> (Coereba flaveola gorgonae) and red-legged honeycreeper (Cyanerpes cyaneus gigas).|$|E
