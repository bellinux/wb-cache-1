40|$|A {{number of}} {{criteria}} such as crack lengths, <b>brittleness</b> <b>temperature</b> range (BTR), critical strain and critical strain rate for initiation of cracking {{are used for}} evaluation of solidification cracking susceptibility of austenitic stainless steel welds. The strain response of the material during welding is commonly described [1] as a temperature range using temperature-strain co-ordinates, called the <b>brittleness</b> <b>temperature</b> range. However, total crack length (TCL) {{has been reported to}} lead to errors in evaluation material susceptibility to cracking [2]. A major objective of this work was to relate solidification cracking behavior to chemical composition of austenitic stainless steel weld metals. In the process, it was necessary to examine the suitability of various criteria for cracking evaluation. Several stainless steels including AISI 316 L, 304 L, 347 and 321 were evaluated for solidification cracking using longitudinal and transverse Varestraint tests using 3 mm thick specimens.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{experimentally}} determine the <b>brittleness</b> <b>temperature</b> range of an alloy based on the intermetallic Ni-Al phase matrix. This was done in order to evaluate the applicability of the said alloy for bonding using welding methods, and specifically, whether the character of the <b>brittleness</b> <b>temperature</b> range of the material indicates susceptibility to hot cracking. Design/methodology/approach: The research was executed using a Gleeble 3800 type simulating device. A simulation of the heating process at a set rate of 20 ºC/s was conducted {{in order to determine the}} NST and then NDT temperatures during the heating stage, followed by the determination of DRT temperature during the cooling stage. This allowed to evaluate the <b>brittleness</b> <b>temperature</b> range. Findings: The executed tests allowed to determine the <b>brittleness</b> <b>temperature</b> range for the examined Ni 3 Al alloy which was found to be situated between 1340 ºC and the liquidus temperature for the heating stage, and down also to 1340 ºC for the cooling stage. Research limitations/implications: The method of simulating the flow of a welding process using the Gleeble 3800 simulator allows to simply and effectively determine the characteristic temperatures of the process and the susceptibility of a given alloy to hot cracking.

It consists {{in the application}} of a deformation at the surface of a solidifying 450 kg steel ingot.

On the other hand, three-dimensional finite element thermomechanical modeling of the test is used. The time evolution of the strain tensor serves to compute an index to evaluate the susceptibility to create hot tears. It is based on the integration of a hot tearing criterion (HTC) that compares the local accumulation of strain with the expression of a critical value proposed in the literature. The main variable of the criterion is the <b>brittleness</b> <b>temperature</b> range (BTR) that refers to the solidification interval during which strain accumulates and creates hot cracks or tears.

In the case of DSA, tensile tests were carried out over the range from room temperature to 450 °C and at strain rates of 10 - 4 to 10 - 1 s- 1. The DSA behavior was also studied in torsion in the austenite and ferrite regions. Aging index (AI) tests were carried out to evaluate the response to SSA and to estimate {{the amount of carbon}} in solution after employing various cooling rates. In all cases, although the atomic Ti/C ratio was greater than one, even still air cooling (3 °C/s) led to a supersaturated/unstabilized material and to the occurrence of both DSA and SSA. By contrast, there were no signs of SSA and DSA after furnace cooling (0. 05 °C/s). The three Ti and the Ti-Nb IF grades studied displayed serrated flow behavior at all strain rates in the blue <b>brittleness</b> <b>temperature</b> range (100 to 300 °C). A simple model is described that predicts whether or not DSA will occur at the strain rates and temperatures involved in the processing of IF steels. It was found that the higher the Ti/S ratio, the higher the solute C. Steels with different chemistries but equal Ti/S ratios displayed the same aging behavior. Internal friction measurements were executed to establish a calibration between the AI values and solute C levels. Two novel techniques for the strengthening of IF steels by dynamic bake hardening (BH) are presented. These techniques lead to much higher BH values compared to those produced by conventional BH methods.

The extent of these impairments {{depends on the}} chemical composition and crystallisation capability of the paraffin; macro-crystalline paraffin (predominantly n-alkanes) has a greater effect than micro-crystalline paraffin (predominantly iso and cyclo-alkane), as the iso and cyclo-alkanes crystallise in a poorer way and thus are more compatible with the bitumen matrix than the n-alkanes. The effects of the paraffin were confirmed experimentally on real and model systems. They are so slight that bitumens with less than 2. 2 % DIN paraffin can in this respect be considered as uncritical. Consistency data such as the dynamic storage module or the load limit for yield stress are to be considered as significant quality characteristics for the cohesion of bitumen. They are mainly influenced {{by the type of}} colloid system. Type of bitumen with high proportions of low soluble asphalts or unfavourable solvent u separator conditions for this fraction are conspicuous in particular as a result of comparatively lower yield stress values.

Recent developments in improving their room temperature ductility by alloying and thermomechanical processing have stimulated an extensive research activities to modify their properties and to produce near-net shape parts by various methods for automotive and aerospace applications. Recently, superplastic behaviour (up to 1000 % elongation) in various intermetallics were reported. This is striking since these materials are quite brittle at room temperature. However, they can be superplastically formed at elevated temperatures provided that the initial grain size is sufficiently fine and the grain growth can be suppressed during deformation. These advancements make intermetallics excellent candidates for high temperature applications. When convenient superplastic forming processes are established and incorporated with diffusion bonding (SPF/DB) as in Ti-alloys the production of intermetallic light-weight complicated structural components for high temperature applications can be realized in one step, which has well known economic advantages over other manufacturing techniques. The aim of this review is to outline the state-of-art developments in superplastic forming and diffusion bonding of intermetallics, especially Ti-Al intermetallics including #gamma#-TiAl developed at GKSS, and to discuss its future prospects to manufacture structural components for elevated temperature applications.

Its <b>brittleness</b> at lower <b>temperatures</b> and a poor creep resistance above 1200 °C have hindered its use as in load-bearing parts. These disadvantages may be offset at least partly by using it together with a second material in a composite or an alloy. Projected applications of MoSi 2 -based materials include, e. g. stationary hot section components in gas turbine engines and glow plugs in diesel engines. For future research and development directions of MoSi 2 -based composites diffusion is a crucial property because creep is closely connected with diffusion. This paper is devoted to the basic diffusion and defect properties of MoSi 2. Data of Si and Mo as well as Ge diffusion from the Münster laboratory for both principal directions are briefly summarized. For all three kinds of atoms diffusion perpendicular to the tetragonal axis is faster than parallel to it. The diffusivities of Mo in both directions are many orders of magnitude slower than those of Si and Ge. The huge asymmetry between Mo and Si (or Ge) diffusion suggests that atomic motion of each constituent is restricted to its own sublattice. Positron annihilation studies on MoSi 2 from the Stuttgart laboratory are reviewed as well. They show that formation of thermal vacancies occurs primarily on the Si sublattice but cannot exclude vacancy formation on the Mo sublattice at higher temperatures. Correlation factors for Si and Mo diffusion via sublattice vacancies in the respective sublattices of MoSi 2 have been calculated recently mainly by Monte Carlo simulation techniques and are also briefly described. Diffusion, in particular self-diffusion, is discussed in connection with literature data on high-temperature creep, which is diffusion-controlled. Grain-size effects of creep have been reported and can be attributed to Nabarro-Herring and Coble creep. Power-law creep is attributed to diffusion-controlled dislocation creep. Some details are, however, not completely understood, presumably {{due to a lack of}} theoretical concepts for creep in uniaxial, stochiometric compounds and due to missing information on grain-boundary diffusion...|$|R
40|$|Complementary and nano-smooth single-crystal-silicon {{surfaces}} {{have been}} fabricated by deliberately fracturing a weakened {{portion of a}} larger structure whose flexural mechanism refines and concentrates an externally applied load to a notched specimen region pre-. fracture and acts as a precision bearing post-fracture. When material is not ejected, crystalline silicon's extreme <b>brittleness</b> at room <b>temperature</b> results in complementary fracture surfaces; "closed" gaps of 20 - 30 nanometers are typical. Lithographic, focused ion beam, and anisotropically etched notches as well as crystal orientation and specimen thickness were studied, and a method was developed for fabricating smooth surfaces perpendicular to the wafer plane: 10 micrometer square specimens oriented with the (110) plane are fully notched by anisotropic etching (KOH) and fractured within a structure optimized to apply pure tension. Prototype MEMS variable capacitors employing fracture surfaces as separable parallel plates have been developed. The advantage of fracture surfaces over etched surfaces is their exceptional flatness or complementarity, which allow them to very closely approach each other prior to contact. (cont.) For a parallel-plate capacitor, a small minimum separation disproportionately improves dynamic range because capacitance scales with the inverse of separation. To take utmost advantage of the surfaces' qualities, unstable pull-in must be avoided. Modelling of the three-way force balance between the structure's compliance, the capacitive force between the fracture surfaces, and the zipping electrostatic actuator demonstrates the system is stable when the actuator is working against the spring force and not the capacitive force. The structure and the capacitor are tuned to ensure system stability to nanometer scale separations. During fabrication of the variable capacitor, {{it was discovered that}} high temperature processing associated with the thermal oxidation necessary for the actuators blunted the anisotropically etched notches. This blunting occurred even when the notches were covered with a nitride diffusion barrier, and was likely due to diffusional smoothing. Blunt notches produced material ejecting fractures with non-functional surfaces, but since material ejection is characteristic of higher stress fractures, it may be useful for toughening anisotropically etched structures. (cont.) The blunting problem was overcome by masking the notch etch with thermal oxide after all high temperature processing was complete. by Alexander D. Sprunt. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{establish}} a simulation scheme that incorporates both ductile and brittle fracture modes with respect to temperature in order to describe the aforementioned toughness dependency on temperature. Whether or not changing only temperature and constraint level would be sufficient to show the ductile-to-brittle transition without incorporating ductile material softening through the Gurson model was investigated. It was found that a stress-criterion alone would not capture the transition of material behaviour. The complete Gurson model was used to simulate softening induced ductile tearing in ABAQUS. The model was incorporated through a user subroutine, UMAT. Simulations for three different temperatures (21 degree C, 0 degree C and - 60 degree C) were run. Fracture resistance curves for all temperatures were plotted from the simulations and compared to experimental data. From this the ductile-to-brittle transition as captured by the complete Gurson model could be plotted. As the model was fitted from the highest temperature, 21 degree C, the fit was very good and the model predicted both CTOD and Da-values here. However, the Gurson model {{is not able to}} capture the brittle characteristics that appear at lower temperatures, and the results clearly deviated at both 0 degree C and - 60 degree C. To account for cleavage, a brittle stress criterion, the RKR-criterion, was applied as a post-processing routine. The input parameters for the criterion were fitted from - 60 degree C, and the prediction of CTOD at this temperature from simulations was very good. A parametric study of the input parameters for the RKR-criterion has been conducted. The length scale, which should be tied with microstructure, was used as a material fitting parameter. The combined Gurson+RKR model severely overestimated <b>brittleness</b> at high <b>temperatures</b> and needed a competing criterion to determine if cleavage has occurred or not. The CTOD at the increment in the simulation corresponding to the maximum force of the characteristic experimental value was used for this. The resulting ductile-to-brittle transition curve gave accurate results at both the upper and lower shelf, and satisfactory, if somewhat conservative, results in the intermediate region. The model captured the change of fracture mechanism over the temperature range from - 60 degree C to 21 degree C. The model still needs some improvement. Some of the material parameters have been detached from their physical value and used as fitting parameters. The simulated DBT-curve is not uniquely determined, but can be shifted...|$|R
30|$|Fibrous {{materials}} are well-known for large specific surface area, fast absorption rate, and excellent actual operability. Some researchers have reported {{a lot of}} fibrous materials {{which can be used}} as oil absorbents, for example, the fibers prepared via dry-wet spinning (Feng and Xiao 2006), gelation spinning (Xu and Xiao 2010), wet spinning (Zhao et al. 2011), melt spinning (Zhao et al. 2012), reactive extrusion-melt spinning (Ma et al. 2013), and graft modification (Li and Wei 2012). Due to good practicability and wide applicability, non-woven fabrics, such as melt blown polypropylene non-woven fabric (Zhao et al. 2013 a, b), are another important fibrous material which can be used as oil absorbent (Radetic et al. 2008). The above-mentioned fibrous materials involving the fibers and non-woven fabrics can absorb a large amount of oily organic liquids; however, since the fibrous {{materials are}} composed of thick fibers, they absorb organic liquids at a relatively slow rate, which has an adverse effect on their application. Electrospun fibrous materials are of great advantage to oil absorption rate for the reason that the diameter of electrospun fibers can reach nanometer level (Zhu et al. 2011). In recent years, some polymers, such as polyacrylonitrile (Su et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2014), poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (Tang et al. 2013), and cellulose acetate (Shang et al. 2012), have been electrospun into fibrous materials and used as oil absorbents to separate oil from water. Polystyrene, as a commonly solvent-soluble and thermoplastic polymer, has more excellent electrospinnability in comparison with other polymers, thus electrospun polystyrene fibrous material has been used widely as oil absorbent (Lin et al. 2012, 2013; Lee et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2012). However, polystyrene is a kind of rigid polymer, thus its electrospun fibrous material exhibits some disadvantages. First, some fibers can fall off the fibrous material due to weak cohesive force among fibers. Second, owning to low <b>temperature</b> <b>brittleness,</b> some fibers break at low temperature, and the fibrous material shows poor strength. Therefore, it is very necessary to improve the performance of electrospun polystyrene fibrous material. The previous work showed that electrospun poly (meth)acrylate fibers could adhere to each other to provide a strong cohesive force for fibrous material (Mo et al. 2014); additionally, poly (butyl acrylate) has good low temperature resistance because it has the properties similar to those of natural rubber. Thereby it was proposed that to copolymerize with butyl acrylate was an effective approach to supply electrospun polystyrene material with good cohesive force and flexibility. As a consequence, the shortages of electrospun polystyrene material could be remedied easily.|$|R
