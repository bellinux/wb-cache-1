40|$|A {{bimetallic}} strip consists of thin plates of two metals with different expansion coefficients rigidly connected along their length such that at normal room temperature the strip is straight. If the strip is heated or cooled, {{the difference in}} expansion of the two metals causes the <b>bimetal</b> <b>strip</b> to bend, as seen in Figure 1. After heating the <b>bimetal</b> <b>strip</b> with a burner, it is cooled in liquid nitrogen so that it bends the opposite direction.

25|$|The {{sideways}} {{displacement of}} the strip is {{much larger than the}} small lengthways expansion in either of the two metals. This effect is used in a range of mechanical and electrical devices. In some applications the <b>bimetal</b> <b>strip</b> is used in the flat form. In others, it is wrapped into a coil for compactness. The greater length of the coiled version gives improved sensitivity.|$|R
50|$|Since {{mercury is}} a {{poisonous}} heavy metal, devices containing mercury switches {{must be treated}} as hazardous waste for disposal. Because it is now RoHS restricted, most modern applications have eliminated it. A metal ball and contact wires can directly replace it, but may require additional circuitry to eliminate switch bounce. Low-precision thermostats use a <b>bimetal</b> <b>strip</b> and a switch contact. Precision thermostats use a thermistor or silicon temperature sensor. Low-cost accelerometers replace the mercury tilt switch in precision applications.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{design of}} <b>bimetal</b> <b>strips</b> {{actuators}} is usually {{based on some}} approximate formulas. The {{cross section of the}} bimetal actuators is usually constant. In order to optimize the shape of the bimetal {{it is important to know}} the configuration of the deformation process in the entire body during real conditions. The paper presents a Finite Element Analysis of simple bimetal beam. There have been considered both thermical and mechanical loads acting on the bimetal actuator. The study focused on the distribution of stresses and the strain energy distribution in both longitudinal and transversal sections. Areas with smallest values and gradients for these parameters could be considered for material removal in order to reduce the volume and optimize the shape of the bimetal simple beam actuator...|$|E

40|$|The human {{tongue is}} a versatile, lithe and {{structurally}} complex muscular organ {{that is of}} paramount importance for many physiological tasks. The lingual musculature is composed of various orthogonally oriented myofiber populations. Furthermore, coupling this knowledge of tissue myoarchitecture with patterns of regional deformation offers the ability to explore complex structure-function relationships in the organ. Tongue myoarchitecture was studied with Diffusion Tensor MRI (DTI), which derived the spatial diffusion tensor field in the tongue. Since, diffusivity relates directly to myofiber orientation, this in vivo technique successfully produced a virtual anatomical atlas. In order to relate this 3 D myoarchitecture to physiological deformations, in vivo strain was quantified by an MRI tagging technique. This technique tagged lingual tissue with a rectilinear grid, which was subsequently imaged to track and quantify deformation through 3 D strain measures. Anterior protrusion, sagittal bending, and oral stage deglutition were studied with this technique. The results demonstrated that synergistic co-contraction between various muscle populations produced the necessary deformations in global tongue shape. In order to delineate specific muscular contributions to sagittal bending, the tongue was modeled by a thermal <b>bimetal</b> <b>strip</b> analog wherein thermal contraction approximated muscle fiber activation. (cont.) The results confirmed our hypothesis that sagittal bending resulted from synergistic co-contraction of two distinct myofiber populations. In conclusion, tongue deformation is intimately related to the lingual musculature, and our results confirm the characterization of the tongue as a muscular hydrostat - an organ whose musculature produces deformation as well as the structural support for that deformation. by Vitaly J.

50|$|The new four-cylinder, {{oversquare}} one-litre water-cooled Opel OHV engine weighed only 96 kg and was {{the first}} all-new engine developed by Opel since before the war. The side-mounted camshaft was driven not through gear-cogs but using a single chain with a hydraulic tensioner, the valve train employing rocker-arms and light-weight hollow rods. The arrangement was low on weight and on friction, permitting engine speeds above 6,000 rpm. The pistons were formed from an aluminium-alloy and incorporated a <b>bimetal</b> expansion <b>strip</b> to ensure uniform thermal expansion. The three-bearing forged crankshaft was of more traditional construction. The carefully designed aluminium inlet manifold provided for efficient feed of the fuel-mixture to the cylinders and helped provide the engine with good fuel economy characteristics.|$|R
40|$|Rayleigh-Lamb, ultrasonic, {{guided wave}} modes {{were used to}} detect delamination, {{embedded}} steel debris and a brittle intermetallic Al-Fe diffusion bond layer at the interface between clad Al and steel, which were bonded together in a cold roll bonding (CRB) process. Multi-layered samples were produced, with artificially implanted defects of different sizes between the clad Al and steel layer to determine {{the sensitivity of the}} guided wave modes to qualitatively indicate the occurrence of defects based on signal attenuation caused by defects. Electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) were used to generate and detect the guided waves in the pitch and catch technique. Signals were measured in the as rolled and post rolling annealed state to determine the influence of the altered material properties on attenuation and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Results show very good sensitivity of the S 0 wave mode for delamination and embedded steel debris detection and a relation between attenuation, defect type, size and annealing state. However, detection of the presence of a brittle intermetallic Al-Fe diffusion layer was not possible due to the strong sensitivity to the material properties and thicknesses of the clad Al and steel materials. Micro sections of all samples were examined to explain the observations. The results suggest a promising use of Rayleigh-Lamb guided wave modes for online detection of bond defects in serial production of Al-Sn alloy/steel <b>bimetal</b> <b>strips...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{non-destructive testing}} (NDT) {{results for the}} detection of bond defects in aluminium-tin (Al-Sn) alloy/steel <b>bimetal</b> <b>strips.</b> Among all types of bimetal strip that are used in the automotive industry for plain journal engine bearings, Al-Sn alloys cold roll bonded (CRB) onto steel backing is the most common type. The difficulty to evaluate the metallurgical bond between the two dissimilar metals is a major industrial concern, which comprises the risk that bearings fail in the field. Considering the harsh performance requirements, 100 % online non-destructive testing would be desirable to significantly reduce the business risk. Nowadays bimetal strip manufacturers still rely on destructive testing through different peel-off tests. This work offers the results from four independent NDT studies, using active thermography, shearography, ultrasound and guided wave electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) and samples with different artificially implanted defects, to explore the feasibility to qualitatively indicate the occurrence of bond defects. A destructive peel off test was used to correlate the NDT results with known bond quality. The studies were done under laboratory conditions, and in case of ultrasound also online under production conditions. During the ultrasound online test, the requirements that a NDT technique has to fulfil for online inspection of Al-Sn alloy/steel bimetal strip were established. For active thermography, shearography and guided wave EMAT techniques, it was theoretically analysed, if the laboratory test results could be transferred to testing under production conditions. As a result, guided waves using EMATs, among the four tested methods, are best suited for online inspection of Al-Sn alloy/steel bimetal strip.
