5|$|Since 1 January 2002, the {{national}} central banks (NCBs) and the ECB have issued euro <b>banknotes</b> on a joint basis. Euro <b>banknotes</b> do not show which central bank issued them. Eurosystem NCBs are required to accept euro <b>banknotes</b> put into circulation by other Eurosystem members and these <b>banknotes</b> are not repatriated. The ECB issues 8% of {{the total value of}} <b>banknotes</b> issued by the Eurosystem. In practice, the ECB's <b>banknotes</b> are put into circulation by the NCBs, thereby incurring matching liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB. These liabilities carry interest at the main refinancing rate of the ECB. The other 92% of euro <b>banknotes</b> are issued by the NCBs in proportion to their respective shares of the ECB capital key, calculated using national share of European Union (EU) population and national share of EU GDP, equally weighted.|$|E
5|$|On 2 February 2009, <b>banknotes</b> of {{the fourth}} dollar (ZWL) were {{introduced}} to replace those of the third dollar at the ratio of one trillion (1012) to 1. It was originally envisaged that <b>banknotes</b> of the third dollar would remain legal tender until 30 June 2009 but all <b>banknotes</b> were withdrawn from circulation following the suspension of the Zimbabwe dollar on 12 April 2009.|$|E

50|$|The $5 <b>banknote</b> has {{the same}} {{electric}} power generation allegory {{that appeared in the}} 1935 Series $5 <b>banknote,</b> and the $10 <b>banknote</b> {{has the same}} transportation allegory as the 1935 Series $2 <b>banknote,</b> represented by a winged figure of the Roman mythological character Mercury. The same fertility allegory that was on the 1935 Series $500 <b>banknote,</b> based on another painting by Foringer, was used on the $20 <b>banknote</b> of this series. The modern inventions allegorical figure on the $50 <b>banknote,</b> industry allegorical figure of the $100 <b>banknote,</b> and security allegorical figure of the $1000 <b>banknote</b> were the same as those used on the same denomination in the 1935 Series.|$|R

5|$|The first <b>banknotes</b> of Zimbabwe {{were issued}} by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (formerly Reserve Bank of Rhodesia) for the first dollar (ZWD) in 1980 to {{coincide}} with the independence of Zimbabwe. These notes replaced the circulating <b>banknotes</b> of the Rhodesian Dollar at par. The first series of <b>banknotes</b> ranged from $2 to $20, and carried the signature of Dr. Desmond Krogh, then the last Governor of the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia from 1973. From 1994 to 1997 the Reserve Bank issued a new series of notes ranging from $2 to $100, although the $2 banknote was withdrawn and replaced by a coin in 1997. As rising inflation started to affect the purchasing power of the Zimbabwean Dollar, the $500 and $1000 <b>banknotes</b> were issued from 2001 to 2005 with enhanced anti-counterfeiting measures.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, the issuing of situado concluded, {{with two}} last {{deliveries}} of 500,000 and 100,000 between 1809 and 1810. This brought forth a critical economical crisis to Puerto Rico. At the moment, Salvador Meléndez Bruna, the colonial governor in office, ordered {{the production of}} provincial paper money. The decree was officially enacted on August 31, 1812. These <b>banknotes</b> used the peso being used as equivalent to Spanish reales. Produced by hand, these <b>banknotes</b> featured quantities in the thousands, with 1 peso being worth 8 reales. Mechanical printing had arrived to Puerto Rico years earlier, but up until 1813, part of the issued notes were being produced by hand and stamped. Between 1812 and 1813, the tradition of collecting paper money continued, which reduced the amount of surviving <b>banknotes</b> drastically. The other notes printed between 1813 and 1814, featured a combination of printed types and stamps, the printing was done by Puerto Rico's National Printing Office and featured patterns to prevent the production of counterfeits. Those featuring denominations in reales, were adorned by Spain's Royal Seal, with the color varying depending on the date of issue, the 1813 8-real <b>banknotes</b> featured a lamb on the obverse. However, these security measures were ineffective against counterfeiting, eventually copies of several denominations were circulating in a widespread manner, forcing cities outside of San Juan, Arecibo and Loiza to discontinue their use. Meléndez Bruna decided {{that the only way}} to prevent forgery was by asking Spain to produce sealed paper for the printing of the <b>banknotes.</b> The first issue bore the signatures of treasurers or accountants, but this was dropped the subsequent year.|$|E

5|$|In the United States {{green was}} {{connected}} with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who tried to use early camera equipment to duplicate <b>banknotes.</b> Also, since the <b>banknotes</b> were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle {{the pictures on the}} front of the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century, the chronically high {{inflation}} was brought under control; this led to the launch of a new currency, the Turkish new lira (Yeni Türk Lirası) in 2005, to cement the acquisition of the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy. In 2009, after only four years in circulation, the Turkish new lira was renamed back to the Turkish lira with the introduction of new <b>banknotes</b> and coins (and the withdrawal of the Turkish new lira <b>banknotes</b> and coins that were introduced in 2005), but the ISO 4217 code of the Turkish new lira (TRY) remains in use for the current Turkish lira in the foreign exchange market.|$|E

The numerals were about 30% larger than in the Birds of Canada series, and was chosen after testing conducted by vision experts at the University of Waterloo.|$|R
