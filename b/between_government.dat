5|$|Both sides {{having been}} {{prompted}} by the new international situation and the recent strike wave in Poland, in September 1988 preliminary talks <b>between</b> <b>government</b> representatives and Solidarity leaders ensued in Magdalenka. Numerous meetings took place involving Wałęsa and the minister of internal affairs, General Czesław Kiszczak among others, {{at that time and}} in the following year, behind the scenes of the official negotiations conducted then. In November, Wałęsa debated on national TV Alfred Miodowicz, chief of the official trade unions. The encounter enhanced Wałęsa's image.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} years of the war, a degree of tension existed between the {{government}} and the army, which divided its allegiance <b>between</b> <b>government</b> and King. The Free Belgian forces, particular the infantry who had been training since 1940, held the government responsible for not being allowed to fight. In November 1942, 12 Belgian soldiers mutinied, complaining about their inactivity. By 1943, the army's royalist stance had been moderated, allowing the government to re-gain the support of the military.|$|E
5|$|In nearby West Bengal in India, {{the death}} toll was largely disputed <b>between</b> <b>government</b> {{agencies}} and news agencies, with the former generally indicating lower figures. While the Kolkata Police Force initially reported 210deaths, various news agencies suggested that {{the death toll}} was around 500. Ultimately, the official death toll in West Bengal reached 538. In addition to human casualties, the cyclone also killed 57,604 heads of cattle. The damage in West Bengal totaled US$13million.|$|E

Somerset {{was the head of the}} Prince of Wales's stables. Although Somerset was interviewed by police, no immediate action was taken against him, and the authorities were slow to act on the allegations of Somerset's involvement.

5|$|Soon {{after midnight}} on 21 August, Nhu's men {{attacked}} the pagodas using automatic firearms, grenades, battering rams and explosives, causing widespread damage. Some religious objects were destroyed, including {{a statue of}} Gautama Buddha in the Từ Đàm Pagoda in Huế, which was partially leveled by explosives. Temples were looted and vandalized, with the remains of venerated monks confiscated. In Huế, violent street battles erupted <b>between</b> <b>government</b> forces and rioting pro-Buddhist, anti-government civilians.|$|E
5|$|The {{alleviation}} {{of widespread}} unemployment and hunger in Poplar {{had to be}} funded from money raised by the borough itself under the Poor Law. The poverty of the borough made this patently unfair and lead to the 1921 conflict <b>between</b> <b>government</b> and the local councillors known as the Poplar Rates Rebellion. Council meetings were for a time held in Brixton prison, and the councillors received wide support. Ultimately, {{this led to the}} abolition of the Poor Laws through the Local Government Act 1929.|$|E

During the 1997 rebellion in Albania, the townspeople of Sarandë in southern Albania were reported to have taken up positions in bunkers around the town in the face of fighting <b>between</b> <b>government</b> troops and rebels. After the outbreak of the Kosovo War in 1999, border villages in Albania were repeatedly shelled by Serbian artillery batteries located in nearby Kosovo and local people used the bunkers to shelter from the shelling.|$|E

5|$|In December, the 4th Infantry Division was {{deployed}} to Greece to reinforce British forces embroiled in the country's civil war. Conflict in Greece <b>between</b> <b>government</b> forces and Communist partisans followed the vacuum {{created by the}} German withdrawal. The partisans (ELAS) sought to establish themselves as the new political authority and confronted the British-supported government-in-exile when ordered to disband and disarm. Within 24 hours of being flown to Piraeus on 12 December, the 2nd King's had to engage partisans in a brief action, seizing occupied barracks {{at a cost of}} 14 casualties. During a seven-week internal security employment, there were many instances of house-to-house and street fighting in Athens. By mid-January 1945, the city had been cleared of insurgents and a ceasefire agreed upon, followed by the Varkiza Agreement in February. The King's remained for a year to support a tense peace until they left for Cyprus.|$|E

5|$|Several agencies, {{including}} the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Oklahoma City have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing, and have proposed {{plans for a}} better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort. Because of the crowded streets, {{and the number of}} response agencies sent to the location, communication <b>between</b> <b>government</b> branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting, thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process. The City of Oklahoma City, in their After Action Report, declared that better communication and single bases for agencies would better the aid of those in disastrous situations.|$|E
5|$|Husayn, however, who {{had been}} {{entrusted}} with the fortress of Ardumusht on the left bank of the Tigris, chose to surrender it instead, and offered his services to the Caliph. He managed to capture the Kharijite leader Harun al-Shari, thereby bringing {{an end to the}} Kharijite revolt in the Jazira. In exchange he secured not only a pardon for his father, but also the lifting of a tribute that the Taghlib had been forced to pay, and the right to form a regiment of 500 Taghlibi cavalry at government expense. This was a major success, laying the groundwork for his own and his family's ascent to power. In the words of the Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy, to the caliph he offered a group of experienced warriors under his own skilled and loyal leadership; to the Taghlib, and other people in the Jazira, he offered the prospect of salaries and booty; and to his own family military command and the opportunity of acquiring wealth in government services. It was in fact not as an independent tribal leader, but rather as an intermediary <b>between</b> <b>government</b> and the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira that al-Husayn made the family fortune.|$|E
5|$|In {{many parts}} of the world {{football}} evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations. R. Kapuscinski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games. The Côte d'Ivoire national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006 and it helped further reduce tensions <b>between</b> <b>government</b> and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouaké, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time. By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras. The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.|$|E

5|$|With the Bình Xuyên vanquished, Diệm {{turned his}} {{attention}} to conquering the Hòa Hảo. As a result, a battle <b>between</b> <b>government</b> troops led by General Dương Văn Minh and Ba Cụt's men commenced in Cần Thơ on 5 June. Five Hòa Hảo battalions surrendered immediately; Ba Cụt and three remaining leaders had fled to the Cambodian border {{by the end of the}} month. The soldiers of the three other leaders eventually surrendered, but Ba Cụt's men continued to the end, claiming loyalty to the Emperor Bảo Đại. Diệm responded by replacing the officers of Bảo Đại's personal regiments with his own men and used the royal units to attack Ba Cụt's rebels near Hà Tiên and Rạch Giá, outnumbering the Hòa Hảo by at least a factor of five. Knowing that they could not defeat the government in open conventional warfare, Ba Cụt's forces destroyed their own bases so that the VNA could not use their abandoned resources, and retreated into the jungle. Ba Cụt's 3,000 men spent the rest of 1955 evading 20,000 VNA troops who had been deployed to quell them. A bounty of one million piasters was put on the head of Ba Cụt, who scattered trails of money in the jungle, hoping to distract his pursuers, but to no avail. The communists claimed in a history written decades later that Ba Cụt had tried to forge an alliance with them, but that talks broke down a few months later.|$|E
