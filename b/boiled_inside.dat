The show is based on Rinella's hunting adventures in such {{locations}} as Montana (deer, elk); Alaska (waterfowl, mountain goat, Dall sheep, caribou, black bear); Mexico (wild turkey, buffalo); New Zealand (tahr, chamois, red stag); Arizona (mountain lion, Coues deer); Wisconsin (white-tailed deer, rabbit); and California (wild pigs, quail, and turkey.) The show offers a defense of the hunting lifestyle, and makes the case that hunters are obligated to be stewards of the land and protectors of their chosen prey species. The episodes include rudimentary food preparations after the hunt.

40|$|Compact heat {{exchangers}} for refrigeration and air-conditioning systems are beneficial to reduce cost, charge inventory and leakage of refrigerant, {{and to improve}} energy efficiency and safety. Using small diameter microfin tubes {{is one way to}} decrease the size of {{heat exchangers}}. Currently, small diameter micofin tubes with outside diameter (O. D.) of 5. 0 mm and 4. 0 mm O. D. begin to be applied in newly developed R 410 A air conditioners instead of conventional size tubes (e. g. 7. 0 mm O. D. microfin tubes). With the decrease of the tube diameter, the pressure drop becomes much larger, resulting in the decrease of the heat exchanger performance. In order to avoid such performance decrease, the heat exchanger should be redesign based on clearly understanding the difference of the heat transfer characteristics between conventional size microfin tubes and small diameter micofin tubes. Therefore, the heat transfer characteristics of R 410 A flow <b>boiling</b> <b>inside</b> both conventional size microfin tubes and small diameter microfin tubes should be known. Under real working conditions of R 410 A air conditioner, some amount of oil inevitably circulates with the refrigerant and has a significant impact on refrigerant evaporation heat transfer characteristics (Shen and Groll, 2005; Thome, 1996). Therefore, the influence of oil on heat transfer characteristics of R 410 A flow <b>boiling</b> <b>inside</b> microfin tubes with different diameters covering from conventional size to small size should be investigated. Experiments of R 410 A-oil mixture flow <b>boiling</b> <b>inside</b> microfin tubes with different outside diameters of 4. 0 7. 0 mm were performed. The experimental results show that, for 7. 0 mm microfin tube, the influence factor of oil on the heat transfer characteristics are larger than 1. 0 under the conditions of low vapor qualities (xr,o 3 ̆c 0. 4), presenting the enhancement effect of oil on heat transfer characteristics; with the increase of vapor quality, the enhancement becomes smaller, and is smaller than 1. 0 under the conditions of low vapor qualities (xr,o 3 ̆e 0. 65), showing the deterioration effect of oil on heat transfer characteristics. As the tube diameter decreases from 7. 0 mm to 4. 0 5. 0 mm, the deterioration effect of oil is weakened, especially at intermediate and high vapor qualities; for 4. 0 - 5. 0 mm tubes, the presence of oil shows the enhancement effect on heat transfer characteristics under the conditions of intermittent vapor quality (0. ...|$|R
