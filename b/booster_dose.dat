40|$|A {{cost-effectiveness}} {{analysis of the}} introduction of acellular pertussis <b>booster</b> <b>doses</b> at either 4 or 15 years of age was performed. A transmission dynamic model was used to predict the level of indirect protection in those {{too young to be}} vaccinated. Multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed. In England and Wales there are an estimated 35, 000 general practitioner (GP) consultations, 5500 inpatient days, and nine deaths annually attributable to pertussis. despite high levels of coverage for the primary course (similar to 95 %). Around 80111 of the bed-days and 90 % of the deaths occur in those too young to be immunised (< 3 months of age). The introduction of acellular <b>booster</b> <b>doses</b> at 4 years is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality in the younger age groups by 40 - 100 %, and at 15 years by 0 - 100 %. From the perspective of the health care provider. roughly 50 % of the simulations result in a cost per life-year gained of less than pound 10, 000 for vaccination at 4 years, the corresponding proportion for vaccination at 15 years being only 35 %. Apart from the degree of indirect protection the model was most sensitive to the discount rate. the price of the vaccine, and the mortality rate. Significant uncertainty remains regarding the epidemiology of pertussis and the impact of <b>booster</b> <b>doses.</b> Nevertheless, the introduction of acellular boosters, particularly at 4 years, {{has the potential to be}} cost-effective in the UK.

40|$|Background: Vaccination against fatal viral and {{bacterial}} diseases {{is still the}} best protective way to lower morbidity and mortality rate in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. It has been reported that there is high incidence of low protective levels of IgG after vaccination in ESRD adult patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the protective status of vaccination against diphtheria and tetanus in ESRD children after completing routine vaccination. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried on 83 participants less than 18 years including 27 patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and 56 normal populations from February 2008 until December 2008 at St. Alzahra hospital, Isfahan, Iran. To determine anti-tetanus and anti-diphtheria antibodies level, Tetanus IgG ELISA kit (IBL International, Germany, RE 56901) and Diphtheria IgG ELISA kit (IBL International, Germany, RE 56191) were used. The participants must not received immunoglobulin, blood products or immunosuppressive medication in the current 6 months. Results: The mean age of case and control group were 12. 5 ± 2. 7 years and 11. 7 ± 3. 3 years, respectively, P > 0. 05. According to IgG levels, 93 % of hemodialysis patients and approximately 87 % of peritoneal dialysis children needed <b>booster</b> <b>doses</b> of diphtheria vaccination. The results for IgG titer against tetanus revealed that in 91 % of hemodialysis patients and 83 % of peritoneal dialysis children <b>booster</b> <b>doses</b> of tetanus were recommended.

50|$|In medicine, a <b>booster</b> <b>dose</b> is {{an extra}} {{administration}} of a vaccine after an earlier (prime) dose. After initial immunization, a booster injection or <b>booster</b> <b>dose</b> is a re-exposure to the immunizing antigen.

40|$|Background. The Global Pertussis Initiative, {{an expert}} {{scientific}} forum, {{was established to}} address the ongoing problems associated with pertussis disease worldwide. Methods. The group analyzed pertussis disease trends, developed recommendations to improve disease control through expanded vaccination strategies, and proposed solutions to barriers to implementation and support of research activities.

In addition, the reported incidence of pertussis disease is increasing in adolescents and adults, who not only experience a considerable health burden themselves but also infect vulnerable infants.

40|$|Experiments in rabbits were {{designed}} to test the two unproven assumptions of the hypothesis proposed in the companion paper (1) : that Original Antigenic Sin is fundamentally a restricted anamnestic response, and that there exists a trapping mechanism capable of deflecting antigen from one kind of cell and guiding it to another. It is shown that whole-body X-irradiation, sufficient to abolish primary but not secondary production of antibodies, leaves all manifestations of the Original Antigenic Sin untouched. This proves the first assumption. Primary immune animals challenged with very large doses of a related antigen produce an immediate response of cross-reactive antibodies, followed by a standard primary response to the challenging antigen. When boosted with an appropriate mixture of both antigens, the response is of standard secondary type to the homologous antigen, followed by a standard primary response to the crossreacting antigen. When animals are primarily vaccinated {{with a mixture of}} two related antigens, small <b>booster</b> <b>doses</b> of either will stimulate a standard secondary response only. When such animals are given very large <b>booster</b> <b>doses</b> of either antigen, the response is a compound of a homologous secondary and of an Original Antigenic Sin-type against the related antigen. Each of these findings demonstrates a corollary of the second assumption. The results are discussed in terms of the limitations they impose on theories concerned with the production of antibodies...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{parenteral}} administration of a killed typhoid vaccine on the intestinal immune response to live orally administered Salmonella typhi Ty 21 a in human subjects was evaluated. Priming with parenteral vaccination neither enhanced nor suppressed the subsequent specific serum and intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune {{responses to a}} booster course of live oral vaccine. Neither a single oral dose of live vaccine nor a single dose of parenteral vaccine had any measurable booster effect on the observed primary intestinal IgA response to the live oral vaccine. Two <b>booster</b> <b>doses</b> of subcutaneously administered killed typhoid vaccine did result in {{a significant increase in}} the specific intestinal IgA antibody in those subjects primed with the oral live vaccine. This response was comparable in magnitude to the primary intestinal response. No evidence of this response could be found in serum IgA, although nonsignificant rises in serum IgG were evident. Previous parenteral priming had no effect on secondary immune responses to a live oral vaccine in humans. Serum immune responses were generally found to be of little value as indicators of local intestinal immunity. This study confirmed that parenteral vaccination was only able to induce an intestinal immune response following priming with live, orally administered organisms and that multiple parenteral <b>booster</b> <b>doses</b> were necessary to induce a measurable effect on intestinal immune responses...|$|R
40|$|The {{burden of}} disease in {{affected}} adolescents and adults, their important contribution to the ongoing circulation of B. pertussis in the population, and the associated direct and indirect costs make prevention of pertussis by immunisation beyond childhood an attractive goal. The recent introduction of <b>booster</b> <b>doses</b> in adolescents in Austria, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United States are {{an important step in}} the right direction. However, this most likely will not {{have a significant impact on}} reduction of disease in young infants and adults. It will be a challenge for the next few years to convince authorities, health care providers, and the general population about the necessity of regular pertussis vaccine <b>booster</b> <b>doses</b> in adults if better control of this potentially devastating disease is wanted. Although, as has recently been said (Cherry 2005), this "may be looked on by many as a pie-in-the-sky vision," the availability of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and reduced acellular pertussis, adsorbed (Tdap) vaccines with proven tolerability and immunogenicity make this goal achievable. Introduction and enforcement of regular pertussis boosters, e. g. every 10 years, will not only reduce the overall morbidity of pertussis in the population but most likely [...] by use of combination vaccines [...] will also improve the less than optimal coverage of diphtheria and tetanus immunisations in adults...|$|R

50|$|The tetanus disease {{requires}} a <b>booster</b> <b>dose</b> every 10 years, {{or in some}} circumstances immediately following infection of tetanus. Td {{is the name of}} the booster for adults, and differs from the primary dose in that it does not include immunization against pertussis (whooping cough). While the US recommends a booster for tetanus every 10 years, other countries, such as the UK, suggest just two booster shots within the first 20 years of life, but no booster after a third decade. Neonatal tetanus is a concern during pregnancy for some women, and mothers are recommended a booster against tetanus during their pregnancy in order to protect their child against the disease.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of the polio vaccine, the memory B and T cells {{produced}} in response to the vaccine persist only six months after consumption of the oral polio vaccine (OPV). Booster doses of the OPV were found ineffective, as they, too, resulted in decreased immune response every six months after consumption. However, when the inactive polio vaccine (IPV) was used as a <b>booster</b> <b>dose,</b> it was found to increase the test subjects' antibody count by 39-75%. Often in developing countries, OPV is used over IPV, because IPV is expensive and hard to transport. However, in places where polio is still present, following up an OPV primary dose with an IPV booster may help eradicate the disease.|$|E
40|$|The risk of poor vaccine {{immunogenicity}} {{and more}} severe influenza disease in HIV necessitate strategies to improve vaccine efficacy. A randomized, multi-centered, controlled, vaccine trial with three parallel groups {{was conducted at}} 12 CIHR Canadian HIV Trials Network sites. Three dosing strategies were used in HIV infected adults (18 to 60 years) : two standard doses over 28 days, two double doses over 28 days and a single standard dose of influenza vaccine, administered prior to the 2008 influenza season. A trivalent killed split non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Fluviral™) was used. Serum hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) activity for the three influenza strains in the vaccine was measured to assess immunogenicity. 297 of 298 participants received at least one injection. Baseline CD 4 (median 470 cells/µL) and HIV RNA (76 % of patients with viral load < 50 copies/mL) were similar between groups. 89 % were on HAART. The overall immunogenicity of influenza vaccine across time points and the three influenza strains assessed was poor (Range HAI ≥ 40 =  31 - 58 %). Double dose plus double <b>dose</b> <b>booster</b> slightly increased the proportion achieving HAI titre doubling from baseline for A/Brisbane and B/Florida at weeks 4, 8 and 20 compared to standard vaccine dose.
