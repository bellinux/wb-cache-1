25|$|The communion {{table is}} the oldest {{in the state and}} is of {{undoubtedly}} an original feature of this church. It is a walnut table with dimension of 65 inches × 30”. It has baluster-like, robust legs and a <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> on all four sides. The molding of the edge of the upper rail is a reversed S (cyma reversa). Reportedly it was used as a chopping block by an American patrol during the War of 1812, and it shows a documented disregard of the sacerdotal nature of communion tables in early American churches cited by Upton as including: use as a desk for in-church schools, use as a hat table, instances of their being “pushed around carelessly,” going so far that stray dogs stole the communion bread and even urinated on the table legs. Hence, regulations were passed that the table in each church must be located on the east wall and that a protective rail be erected around it. The use of any church as a school, in particular, is puzzling because most colonial vestries scrupulously avoided using the church even for parish business, meeting in a separate vestry house close by a church or in the room formed by bell towers such as at St. Peter’s, New Kent County. The vestry house for this church remained as a ruin just outside the west wall until 1820.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} in {{records are}} those {{represented in the}} paintings of the Egyptian tombs, {{in which they are}} shown as single or double doors, each in a single piece of wood. Doors were once believed to be the literal doorway to the afterlife, and some doors leading to important places included designs of the afterlife. In Egypt, where the climate is intensely dry, there would be no fear of their warping, but in other countries it would be necessary to frame them, which according to Vitruvius (iv. 6.) was done with stiles (sea/si) and rails (see: Frame and panel): the spaces enclosed being filled with panels (tympana) let into grooves made in the stiles and rails. The stiles were the vertical boards, one of which, tenoned or hinged, is known as the hanging stile, the other as the middle or meeting stile. The horizontal cross pieces are the top rail, <b>bottom</b> <b>rail,</b> and middle or intermediate rails. The most ancient doors were made timber, such as those referred to in the Biblical depiction of King Solomon's temple being in olive wood (I Kings vi. 31-35), which were carved and overlaid with gold. The doors dwelt upon in Homer would appear to have been cased in silver or brass. Besides olive wood, elm, cedar, oak and cypress were used. A 5,000-year-old door has been found by archaeologists in Switzerland.|$|E
2500|$|Rails – Horizontal boards at the top, bottom, and {{optionally}} in {{the middle}} of a door that join the two stiles and split the door into two or more rows of panels. The [...] "top rail" [...] and [...] "bottom rail" [...] are named for their positions. The <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> is also known as [...] "kick rail". A middle rail at the height of the bolt is known as the [...] "lock rail", other middle rails are commonly known as [...] "cross rails".|$|E

50|$|As {{part of a}} {{modernisation}} project, {{the whole}} line was upgraded to a narrow gauge railway in 1874. The tramway was relaid with flat <b>bottom</b> <b>rails</b> on wooden sleepers allowing a locomotive to be used {{on the line to}} Stepaside.|$|R
2500|$|The CPW is {{available}} in 9mm Parabellum (9×19mm NATO) caliber for now and [...] "resembles an updated/modernized MP7A1". The main differences are the angled pistol grip of the CPW for enhanced ergonomics and natural aiming, and a transparent rear magazine so that the operator can see the rounds remaining. Other features include a skeletonised trigger, a full-length Mil-Std-1913 Picatinny top rail for mounting accessories such as optics and lasers, and a shorter <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> {{in front of the}} trigger guard for mounting a vertical foregrip.|$|E
2500|$|G36K (K—kurz [...] "short"): carbine variant with {{a shorter}} barrel (fitted with an open-type flash suppressor) and a shorter forend, which {{includes}} a <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> {{that can be used}} to attach tactical accessories, such as a UTL flashlight from the USP pistol. The carbine's barrel lacks the ability to launch rifle grenades and it will not support a bayonet. The weapon retained the ability to be used with the AG36 grenade launcher. G36Ks in service with German special forces are issued with a 100-round C-Mag drum. There are two variants of the G36K. The first and most commonly known has x3 scope/carry handle attached to the top, while the second is equipped with iron sights and a rail (no scope included).|$|E
2500|$|The {{most famous}} {{preserved}} {{representation of the}} menorah of the Temple was depicted in a frieze on the Arch of Titus, commemorating his triumphal parade in Rome following the destruction of Jerusalem in the year 70 CE. In that frieze, the menorah is shown resting upon a double octagonal base, built all around {{in the form of}} a step. The lower base was identical in design to the upper base, only larger in circumference. Each facet of the octagonal base was made with two vertical stiles and two horizontal rails, a top rail and a <b>bottom</b> <b>rail,</b> resembling a protruding frame set against a sunken panel. These panels have some relief design set or sculpted within them. The panels are depicting the Ziz and the Leviathan from Jewish mythology.|$|E

60|$|Dick {{would return}} some matter-of-course reply, and Mr Brass {{standing}} on the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> of his stool, so as to get {{a view of the}} street {{over the top of the}} window-blind, would take an observation of the visitors.|$|E
60|$|Their little ruse was now quite evident. They {{had come}} back from {{gathering}} rabbit fur, and found me unexpectedly near their nest. Instead of making a fuss and betraying it, as other birds might do, they lit on the rail before me, and were as sociable as only chickadees know how to be. While one entertained me, and kept my attention, the other dropped to the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> and stole along behind it; then up behind the post that held their nest, and back the same way, after leaving his material. Then he held my attention while his mate did the same thing.|$|E
60|$|As she did so, a most {{extraordinary}} thing happened. The bed-clothes gathered themselves together, leapt up suddenly {{into a sort}} of peak, and then jumped headlong over the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail.</b> It was exactly as if a hand had clutched them in the centre and flung them aside. Immediately after, the stranger's hat hopped off the bed-post, described a whirling flight in the air through {{the better part of a}} circle, and then dashed straight at Mrs. Hall's face. Then as swiftly came the sponge from the washstand; and then the chair, flinging the stranger's coat and trousers carelessly aside, and laughing drily in a voice singularly like the stranger's, turned itself up with its four legs at Mrs. Hall, seemed to take aim at her for a moment, and charged at her. She screamed and turned, and then the chair legs came gently but firmly against her back and impelled her and Hall out of the room. The door slammed violently and was locked. The chair and bed seemed to be executing a dance of triumph for a moment, and then abruptly everything was still.|$|E
50|$|Flat <b>bottom</b> <b>rails</b> {{were still}} seen as {{undesirable}} for British main line railway use, despite their successful use in North America, although some lightly operated British railways used them, generally spiked direct to the sleepers. Under heavy usage, they indent the sleepers severely and the incremental {{cost of a}} base-plate appeared at this early date, to rule the flat bottom section out.|$|R

60|$|Walking {{across the}} fields for the {{distance}} of a mile or two, she came out upon the high-road by a wicket-gate. On {{the other side of}} the way was the entrance to what at first sight looked like a neglected meadow, the gate being a rotten one, without a <b>bottom</b> <b>rail,</b> and broken-down palings lying on each side. The dry hard mud of the opening was marked with several horse and cow tracks, that had been half obliterated by fifty score sheep tracks, surcharged with the tracks of a man and a dog. Beyond this geological record appeared a carriage-road, nearly grown over with grass, which Anne followed. It descended by a gentle slope, dived under dark-rinded elm and chestnut trees, and conducted her on till the hiss of a waterfall and the sound of the sea became audible, when it took a bend round a swamp of fresh watercress and brooklime that had once been a fish pond. Here the grey, weather-worn front of a building edged from behind the trees. It was Oxwell Hall, once the seat of a family now extinct, and of late years used as a farmhouse.|$|E
60|$|There {{were three}} or four of us, {{counting}} me. My working place was established {{in a corner of the}} warehouse, where Mr. Quinion could see me, when he chose to stand up on the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> of his stool in the counting-house, and look at me through a window above the desk. Hither, on the first morning of my so auspiciously beginning life on my own account, the oldest of the regular boys was summoned to show me my business. His name was Mick Walker, and he wore a ragged apron and a paper cap. He informed me that his father was a bargeman, and walked, in a black velvet head-dress, in the Lord Mayor's Show. He also informed me that our principal associate would be another boy whom he introduced by the--to me--extraordinary name of Mealy Potatoes. I discovered, however, that this youth had not been christened by that name, but that it had been bestowed upon him in the warehouse, on account of his complexion, which was pale or mealy. Mealy's father was a waterman, who had the additional distinction of being a fireman, and was engaged as such at one of the large theatres; where some young relation of Mealy's--I think his little sister--did Imps in the Pantomimes.|$|E

50|$|When {{the line}} was constructed, the track had been light, using flat <b>bottom</b> <b>rails</b> spiked {{directly}} to the sleepers. The very sharp curves led to gauge spreading, even under the short wheelbase of the Terrier locomotives, and in 1910 the track was relaid in bullhead material. A second renewal took place later, in Southern Railway days, and a further time in association with easing and recanting {{of the most difficult}} curves in 1959.|$|R
50|$|For {{the supply}} of clothes, food and fuel to the nursing home Lainz, the Vienna City Administration decided to {{construct}} a manually operated narrow gauge railway. The Lehmann & Leyer company constructed a 4 km network with a track gauge of , with a base made of steel sleepers and flat <b>bottom</b> <b>rails.</b> The work was completed in three months. At the crossing points of the tracks {{as well as the}} branches to the pavilions 61 cast-iron turntables were constructed.|$|R

50|$|The SM&AR {{line had}} {{originally}} been laid with Vignoles (flat <b>bottom)</b> <b>rails</b> of 70 lbs per yard (35 kg/m) in 18 to 24 feet (5.5 to 7.3 metre) lengths, but the northward extension was laid with 75 lb per yard (37 kg/m) bullhead rail. The track limited locomotive weight, and was gradually replaced by 87 lb per yard (43 kg/m) bullhead track, but this took until 1928. Cerney station was renamed South Cerney on 1 July 1924. Blunsdon station closed in September 1924.|$|R

A continuous rack was fixed to the longitudinal timbers, and a pawl—Leslie calls it a [...] "pall"—attached to the carriage was arranged to engage the rack if the tension was let off the haulage cable.|$|R
5000|$|On 30 June 1854 Captain Tyler of the Board of Trade {{made his}} {{inspection}} of the Crediton to Barnstaple section; it was not proposed to open the Barnstaple to Fremington line until the continuation to Bideford was ready. (In fact the powers for this had not been renewed, and they lapsed.) He made some comments regarding signal positions and observed that the track was broad gauge on cross sleepers [...] "with double I rails": flat <b>bottom</b> <b>rails.</b> It was single line broad gauge throughout, with the electric telegraph installed throughout the line.|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} motor scoops up a ball every minute. Every five minutes, the top rail will dump and deposit a {{ball on the}} second rail. Every hour, the upper and middle rails dump and one ball is transferred to the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> to increment the hours. At 1:00 all three rails dump their balls to the feed rail at the bottom.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} rolling ball clock has three main rails - two labeled for minutes and one for hours. The <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> represents the hours. The middle rail represents the minutes in multiples of 5 or 10 , while the top rail displays the numbers 1 through 4.

50|$|A contractor, Frederick Furness, was {{appointed}} on 9 July 1868 {{and he was}} prepared to take part of the payment for his services in preference shares. The canal was closed and the line was laid as far as possible on the towpath. Under certain bridges the line was laid at a lower level than the towpath, necessitating short downgrades to pass under; nonetheless the headroom at overbridges was very restricted, leading to problems later. At the locks quite steep gradients were employed to accommodate the change of level. The track was laid with flat <b>bottom</b> <b>rails</b> weighing 50 to 60 lbs per yard spiked directly to the sleepers.|$|R
