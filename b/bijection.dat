5|$|The update rule is an {{injective}} function, that is, {{there are}} no two configurations that both map to the same common configuration. This condition is obviously implied by {{the assumption that the}} update rule is a <b>bijection.</b> In the other direction, the Garden of Eden theorem for cellular automata implies that every injective update rule is bijective.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} every {{countable}} set of partial <b>bijections</b> from an infinite set to {{itself can be}} obtained as a composition of just two such partial <b>bijections.</b> This strengthens a result by Higgins, Howie, Mitchell and Ruškuc stating that every such countable set of partial <b>bijections</b> may be obtained as the composition of two partial <b>bijections</b> and their inverses...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{notions of}} linear reduction and linear equivalence of <b>bijections</b> {{for the purposes}} of study <b>bijections</b> between Young tableaux. Originating in Theoretical Computer Science, these notions allow us to give a unified view of a number of classical <b>bijections,</b> and establish formal connections between them.

5|$|The {{number of}} maximal {{directed}} pseudoforests on n vertices, allowing self-loops, is nn, because for each vertex there are n possible endpoints for the outgoing edge. André Joyal used this fact {{to provide a}} bijective proof of Cayley's formula, {{that the number of}} undirected trees on n nodes is n'n2, by finding a <b>bijection</b> between maximal directed pseudoforests and undirected trees with two distinguished nodes. If self-loops are not allowed, the number of maximal directed pseudoforests is instead (n1)n.|$|E
5|$|A {{continuous}} map between two topological spaces induces a group homomorphism between the associated homotopy groups. In particular, if the map is a continuous <b>bijection</b> (a homeomorphism), {{so that the}} two spaces have the same topology, then their i-th homotopy groups are isomorphic for all i. However, the real plane has exactly the same homotopy groups as a solitary point (as does a Euclidean space of any dimension), and the real plane with a point removed has the same groups as a circle, so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces. Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate, it can also make certain computations easier.|$|E
25|$|If α is an {{infinite}} ordinal {{then there is}} a <b>bijection</b> between Lα and α, and the <b>bijection</b> is constructible. So these sets are equinumerous in any model of set theory that includes them.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{invertible}} polynomial maps over a finite field Fq, if looked at as <b>bijections</b> Fn,q −→ Fn,q, give all possible <b>bijections</b> in the case q = 2, or q = p^r where p > 2. In the case q = 2 ^r where r > 1 it is {{shown that the}} tame subgroup of the invertible polynomial maps gives only the even <b>bijections,</b> i. e. only half the <b>bijections.</b> As a consequence it is shown that a set S ⊂ Fn,q can be a zero set of a coordinate {{if and only if}} #S = q^(n− 1) ...|$|R
25|$|Just as order {{relations}} {{are grounded in}} ordered sets, sets closed under pairwise supremum and infimum, equivalence {{relations are}} grounded in partitioned sets, which are sets closed under <b>bijections</b> and preserve partition structure. Since all such <b>bijections</b> map an equivalence class onto itself, such <b>bijections</b> are also known as permutations. Hence permutation groups (also known as transformation groups) and the related notion of orbit {{shed light on the}} mathematical structure of equivalence relations.|$|R
40|$|The Jacobian group Jac(G) of {{a finite}} graph G {{is a group}} whose {{cardinality}} {{is the number of}} spanning trees of G. G also has a tropical Jacobian which has the structure of a real torus; using the notion of break divisors, An et al. obtained a polyhedral decomposition of the tropical Jacobian where vertices and cells correspond to elements of Jac(G) and spanning trees of G, respectively. We give a combinatorial description of <b>bijections</b> coming from this geometric setting. This provides a new geometric method for constructing <b>bijections</b> in combinatorics. We introduce a special class of geometric <b>bijections</b> that we call edge ordering maps, which have good algorithmic properties. Finally, we study the connection between our geometric <b>bijections</b> and the class of <b>bijections</b> introduced by Bernardi; in particular we prove a conjecture of Baker that planar Bernardi <b>bijections</b> are "geometric". We also give sharpened versions of results by Baker and Wang on Bernardi torsors.

25|$|This {{relation}} between points and lines is a <b>bijection.</b>|$|E
25|$|Formally, the gluing {{is defined}} by a <b>bijection</b> between the two boundaries. Two points are {{identified}} when they are mapped onto each other. For a topological manifold this <b>bijection</b> should be a homeomorphism, otherwise the result {{will not be a}} topological manifold. Similarly for a differentiable manifold {{it has to be a}} diffeomorphism. For other manifolds other structures should be preserved.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{construct}} {{a family of}} extremely simple <b>bijections</b> that yield Cayley's famous formula for counting trees. The weight preserving properties of these <b>bijections</b> furnish a number of multivariate generating functions for weighted Cayley trees. Essentially the same idea is used to derive bijective proofs and q-analogues {{for the number of}} spanning trees of other graphs, including the complete bipartite and complete tripartite graphs. These <b>bijections</b> also allow the calculation of explicit formulas for the expected number of various statistics on Cayley trees...|$|R
50|$|The {{notion of}} {{one-to-one}} correspondence generalizes to partial functions, {{where they are}} called partial <b>bijections,</b> although partial <b>bijections</b> are only required to be injective. The reason for this relaxation is that a (proper) partial function is already undefined {{for a portion of}} its domain; thus there is no compelling reason to constrain its inverse to be a total function, i.e. defined everywhere on its domain. The set of all partial <b>bijections</b> on a given base set is called the symmetric inverse semigroup.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{establish}} six <b>bijections</b> between a particular class of polyominoes, called deco polyominoes, enumerated {{according to their}} directed height by n!, and permutations. Each of these <b>bijections</b> allows us to establish different correspondences between classical statistics on deco polyominoes and on permutations. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} theory of {{integration}} over valued fields of residue characteristic zero. In particular we obtain new and base-field independent foundations for integration over local fields of large residue characteristic, extending results of Denef,Loeser, Cluckers. The method depends on an analysis of definable sets up to definable <b>bijections.</b> We obtain a precise description of the Grothendieck semigroup of such sets in terms of related groups over the residue field and value group. This yields new invariants of all definable <b>bijections,</b> as well as invariants of measure preserving <b>bijections...</b>|$|R
50|$|More generally, {{injective}} partial {{functions are}} called partial <b>bijections.</b>|$|R
25|$|Because a {{function}} is trivially surjective when restricted to its image, the term partial <b>bijection</b> denotes a partial function which is injective.|$|E
25|$|If a {{continuous}} <b>bijection</b> {{has as its}} domain a compact space and its codomain is Hausdorff, then it is a homeomorphism.|$|E
25|$|A natural {{question}} arises {{as to the}} relationship of the one-line and the canonical cycle notation. For example, considering the permutation (2)(31), which is in canonical cycle notation, if we erase its cycle parentheses, we obtain a different permutation in one-line notation, namely 231. (The permutation (2)(31) is actually 321 in one-line notation.) Foata's transition lemma establishes the nature of this correspondence as a <b>bijection</b> on the set of n-permutations (to itself). Richard P. Stanley calls this correspondence the fundamental <b>bijection.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{establish}} natural <b>bijections</b> {{between three}} different classes of combinatorial objects; namely certain families of locally 2 –arc transi-tive graphs, partial linear spaces, and homogeneous factorisations of arc-transitive graphs. Moreover, the <b>bijections</b> intertwine {{the actions of}} the relevant automorphism groups. Thus constructions in any of these areas provide examples for the others. ...|$|R
40|$|Given a pair {{of number}} fields with {{isomorphic}} rings of adeles, we construct <b>bijections</b> between objects associated to the pair. For instance we construct an isomorphism of Brauer groups that commutes with restriction. We additionally construct <b>bijections</b> between central simple algebras, maximal orders, various Galois cohomology sets, and commensurability classes of arithmetic lattices in simple, inner algebraic groups. We show that under certain conditions, lattices corresponding to one another under our <b>bijections</b> have the same covolume and pro-congruence completion.

40|$|First, we {{investigate}} a generalization {{of the area}} statistic on Dyck paths for all crystallographic reflection groups. In particular, we explore Dyck paths of type B together with an area statistic and a major index. Then, we construct <b>bijections</b> between non-nesting and reverse non-crossing partitions for types A and B. These <b>bijections</b> simultaneously send the area statistic and the major index on non-nesting partitions to the length function and to {{the sum of the}} major index and the inverse major index on reverse non-crossing partitions. Finally, we construct <b>bijections</b> between non-nesting partitions and Coxeter sortable elements for types A and B havin...|$|R
25|$|Since every {{function}} is surjective when its codomain {{is restricted to}} its image, every injection induces a <b>bijection</b> onto its image. More precisely, every injection f : X → Y can be factored as a <b>bijection</b> followed by an inclusion as follows. Let f'R : X → f(X) be f with codomain restricted to its image, and let i : f(X) → Y be the inclusion map from f(X) into Y. Then f = i o f'R. A dual factorisation is given for surjections below.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there is}} no natural number which can be paired with D, we have contradicted our {{original}} supposition, {{that there is a}} <b>bijection</b> between ℕ and 𝒫(ℕ).|$|E
25|$|Every <b>bijection</b> has {{an inverse}} {{function}} that undoes its action, and thus each {{element of a}} symmetric group does have an inverse which is a permutation too.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bijections</b> are {{precisely}} the isomorphisms {{in the category}} Set of sets and set functions. However, the <b>bijections</b> are not always the isomorphisms for more complex categories. For example, in the category Grp of groups, the morphisms must be homomorphisms since they must preserve the group structure, so the isomorphisms are group isomorphisms which are bijective homomorphisms.|$|R
40|$|Let PO_n be the semigroup of all order-preserving partial {{transformations of}} a finite chain.

Several {{consequences}} of these <b>bijections</b> were discussed. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} {{two general}} mechanisms for producing pair-ing <b>bijections</b> (bijective functions defined from N 2 → N). The first mechanism, using n-adic valuations results in parameterized algorithms generating a countable family of distinct pairing <b>bijections.</b> The second mechanism, using characteristic functions of subsets of N provides 2 N distinct pairing <b>bijections.</b> Mechanisms to combine such pairing functions and their application to generate families of permutations of N are also described. The paper uses a small {{subset of the}} functional language Haskell to provide type checked executable specifications of all the functions defined in a literate programming style.
