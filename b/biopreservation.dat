5000|$|<b>Biopreservation</b> {{is the use}} {{of natural}} or {{controlled}} microbiota or antimicrobials as a way of preserving food and extending its shelf life. The <b>biopreservation</b> of food, especially utilizing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that are inhibitory to food spoilage microbes, has been practiced since early ages, at first unconsciously but eventually with an increasingly robust scientific foundation. Beneficial bacteria or the fermentation products produced by these bacteria are used in <b>biopreservation</b> to control spoilage and render pathogens inactive in food. There are a various modes of action through which microorganisms can interfere with the growth of others such as organic acid production, resulting in a reduction of pH and the antimicrobial activity of the un-dissociated acid molecules, a wide variety of small inhibitory molecules including hydrogen peroxide, etc. [...] It is a benign ecological approach which is gaining increasing attention.|$|E
50|$|A modern approach, <b>biopreservation,</b> adds {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} to the fish to be fermented.

50|$|<b>Biopreservation</b> judiciously {{exploits}} the antimicrobial {{potential of}} naturally occurring microorganisms in food and/or their metabolites {{with a long}} history of safe use. Bacteriocins, bacteriophages and bacteriophage-encoded enzymes fall in this theory. The long and traditional role of Lactic acid bacteria on food and feed fermentations is the main factor related to the use of bacteriocins in <b>biopreservation.</b> LAB and their bacteriocins have been consumed unintentionally for ages, laying down a long history of safe use. Their antimicrobial spectrum of inhibition, bactericidal mode of action, relative tolerance to processing conditions (pH, NaCl, heat treatments) and the lack of toxicity towards eukaryotic cells enforces their role as biopreservatives in food. The evaluation of any new antimicrobial actives is done in meat by USDA which relies on the GRAS assessment by FDA among other suitability data.|$|E

5000|$|Fishery {{products}} {{are a source}} of wide variety of valuable nutrients such as proteins, vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fatty acids, taurine, etc. Fishery products, however, are also associated with human intoxication and infection. Approximately 10 to 20% of food-borne illnesses are attributed to fish consumption. Changing consumer demand has driven the appeal of traditional processes applied to seafood (e.g. salting, smoking and canning) lower compared to mild technologies involving lower salt content, lower cooking temperature and vacuum packing (VP)/modified atmosphere packing (MAP). These products, designed as lightly preserved fish products (LPFP), are usually produced from fresh seafood and further processing increases risk of cross contamination. These milder treatments are usually not sufficient to destroy microorganisms, and in some cases psychrotolerant pathogenic and spoilage bacteria can develop during the extended shelf-life of LPFP. Many of these {{products are}} also eaten raw, so minimizing the presence and preventing growth of microorganisms is essential for the food quality and safety. The microbial safety and stability of food are based on an application of preservative factors called hurdles. [...] The delicate texture and flavor of seafood are very sensitive to the decontamination technologies such as cooking, and more recent mild technologies such as pulsed light, high pressure, ozone, and ultrasound. Chemical preservatives, which are not processes but ingredients, are out of favor with consumers due to natural preservatives demand. An alternative solution that is gaining more and more attention is <b>biopreservation</b> technology. In fish processing, <b>biopreservation</b> is achieved by adding antimicrobials or by increasing the acidity of the fish muscle. Most bacteria stop multiplying when the pH is less than 4.5. Traditionally, acidity has been increased by fermentation, marination or by directly adding acetic, citric or lactic acid to food products. Other preservatives include nitrites, sulphites, sorbates, benzoates and essential oils. The main reason for less documented studies for application of protective microorganisms, bacteriophages or bacteriocins on seafood products for <b>biopreservation</b> compared to dairy or meat products is probably that the early stages of <b>biopreservation</b> have occurred mainly in fermented foodstuffs that are not so developed among seafood products. [...] The selection of potential protective bacteria in seafood products is challenging {{due to the fact that}} they need adaptation to the seafood matrix (poor in sugar and their metabolic activities should not change the initial characteristics of the product, i.e. by acidification, and not induce spoilage that could lead to a sensory rejection. Among the microbiota identified in fresh or processed seafood, LAB remains the category that offers the highest potential for direct application as a bioprotective culture or for bacteriocin production.|$|E

50|$|In meat processing, <b>biopreservation</b> {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied in fermented meat products and ready to eat meat products. The use of native or artificially-introduced microbial population to improve animal health and productivity, and/or to reduce pathogenic organisms, has been termed a probiotic or competitive enhancement approach.

Performing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis on the desiccated droplets, spatial distributions of the components within the dried droplet, {{as well as their}} specific interactions, were investigated. It was established that the formation of multiple thermodynamic states was induced by the spatial variations in the cosolute concentration gradients, directly affecting the final structure of the preserved protein. The spatial distribution gradients were formed by two competing flows that formed within the drying droplet: a dominant peripheral flow, induced by contact line pinning, and the Marangoni flow, induced by surface tension gradients. It was found that the changes in cosolute concentrations and drying conditions affected the spatial heterogeneity and stability of the product. It was also found that trehalose and salts had a synergistic stabilizing effect on the protein structure, which originated from destructuring of the vicinal water, which in turn mediated the interactions of trehalose with the protein.

40|$|Saccharide-based <b>biopreservation</b> {{is widely}} studied {{because of its}} {{scientific}} importance and possible technological outcomes for food and pharmaceutical industries. Ternary protein/saccharide/water systems have been extensively exploited to model {{the characteristics of the}} in vivo <b>biopreservation</b> process. A tight, water dependent, protein–matrix coupling has been shown to occur in various simple saccharide amorphous matrices, which is stronger in trehalose. The efficiency as bioprotectant of trehalose has been ascribed to this tight coupling, since the appearance of damages on biological structures will more involve structural variations of the surrounding matrix. Here we present, as an applicative follow-up of this research line, a Fourier transform infrared study on protein–matrix coupling in commercial maltodextrins and trehalosyldextrins solid amorphous systems, with carboxymyoglobin embedded, and compare the results with analogous system containing trehalose and maltose, previously reported. Results point out that trehalosyldextrins are useful candidates as protecting agents, even though with an efficiency lower than trehalose, and could be used when the rheological properties of relative long-chain oligosaccharides are needed.

40|$|International audienceOne hundred sixty psychrotrophic {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (LAB) isolated from wild and aquacultured fresh fish were identified by biochemical and molecular methods using 16 S- 23 S rRNA spacer analysis and 16 S rDNA sequencing. LAB strains were characterised according to their technological properties including acidifying capacity, antibiotic resistance and proteolytic, lipolytic and enzymatic activities, as well as antimicrobial activities, against pathogenic and spoilage bacteria in order to select the most suitable strains for use as starter cultures in the <b>biopreservation</b> of fresh fish and seafood products. The majority of strains displayed antimicrobial activities against pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella arizonae, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Aspergillus flavus) and the dominant psychrotrophic Gram-negative bacteria in fresh fish (Pseudomonas fluorescens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas putida and Photobacterium damselae). A total of 39 isolates of LAB isolates having the most important antimicrobial activities were selected for further properties. Low proteolytic and lipolytic activities were detected for all strains using azocasein methods and fish fat, respectively. Moreover, all strains showed acidifying activity by reducing pH to less than 4. 38 at 37 C after 72 h. Finally, all studied LAB were resistant to penicillin, gentamicin, colistin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, erythromycin, tetracycline and streptomycin.

40|$|As {{part of the}} “free-from” trend, <b>biopreservation</b> {{for bread}} {{products}} has increasingly become important to prevent spoilage since artificial preservatives {{are more and more}} rejected by consumers. A literature review conducted as part of this thesis revealed that the evaluation of more suitable antifungal strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) is important. Moreover, increasing the knowledge about the origin of the antifungal effect is fundamental for further enhancement of <b>biopreservation.</b> This thesis addresses the investigation of Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM 19280, Lb. brevis R 2 : and Lb. reuteri R 29 for <b>biopreservation</b> using in vitro trials and in situ sourdough fermentations of quinoa, rice and wheat flours as biopreservatives in breads. Their contribution to quality and shelf life extension on bread was compared and related to their metabolic activity and substrate features. Moreover, the quantity of antifungal carboxylic acids produced during sourdough fermentation was analysed. Overall a specific profile of antifungal compounds was found in the sourdough samples which were strain and substrate dependently different. The best preservative effect in quinoa sourdough and wheat sourdough bread was achieved when Lb. amylovorus DSM 19280 fermented sourdough was used. However, the concentration of the antifungal compounds found in these biopreservatives were much lower when compared with Lb. reuteri R 29 as the highest producer. Nevertheless, the artificial application of the highest concentration of these antifungal compounds in chemically acidified wheat sourdough bread succeeded in a longer shelf life than achieved only by acidifying the dough. This evidences their partial contribution to the antifungal activity and their synergy. Additionally, a HRGC/MS method for the identification and quantification of the antifungal active compounds cyclo(Leu-Pro), cyclo(Pro-Pro), cyclo(Met-Pro) and cyclo(Phe-Pro) was successfully developed by using stable isotope dilutions assays with the deuterated counterparts. It was observed that the concentrations of cyclo(Leu-Pro), cyclo(Pro-Pro), and cyclo(Phe-Pro) increased only moderately in MRS-broth and wort fermentation by the activity of the selected microorganism, whereas the concentration of cyclo(Met-Pro) stayed unchanged...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this paper}} was the {{technological}} characterization of a Lactobacillus sakei strain able to produce the bacteriocin sakacin P. Experiments were conducted in vitro, using MRS-based medium, and in vivo, when the strain was inoculated as starter culture in real sausage fermenta-tion. The results obtained underlined that the strain was able to grow in conditions that are com-monly used in the production line, and only lactose and high concentrations of NaCl (5 % w/v) affected the capability for bacteriocin production. When inoculated in sausages, it showed a good performance, being able to colonize rapidly the ecosystem. A high number of isolates, producing sakacin P, where found already from the third day of fermentation, and this number remained sta-ble throughout the fermentation.

Due to the increased awareness of consumers in sensorial and nutritional qualities of fresh-cut {{fruits and vegetables}}, {{as well as the}} serious concerns towards public health caused by foodborne outbreaks owing to inappropriate handling or preservation of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables, fresh-cut industry is in urgent need of new and improved technologies for shelf life extension.
