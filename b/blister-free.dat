40|$|Atomic layer {{deposition}} (ALD) of thin Al 2 O 3 (= 10 ¿nm) films is used {{to improve}} the rear surface passivation of large-area screen-printed p-type Si passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC). A <b>blister-free</b> stack of Al 2 O 3 /SiOx/SiNx is developed, leading to an improved back reflection and a rear recombination current (J 0,rear) of 92 ¿±¿ 6 ¿fA/cm 2. The Al 2 O 3 /SiOx/SiNx stack is <b>blister-free</b> if a 700 °C anneal in N 2 is performed after the Al 2 O 3 deposition and prior to the SiOx/SiNx capping. A clear relationship between blistering density and lower open-circuit voltage (VOC) due to increased rear contacting area is shown. In case of the <b>blister-free</b> Al 2 O 3 /SiOx/SiNx rear surface passivation stack, an average cell efficiency of 19. 0 % is reached and independently confirmed by FhG-ISE CalLab. Compared with SiOx/SiNx-passivated PERC, there is an obvious gain in VOC and short-circuit current (JSC) of 5 ¿mV and 0. 2 ¿mA/cm 2, respectively, thanks to improved rear surface passivation and rear internal reflection...|$|E
40|$|Inner {{and outer}} panel of {{automobile}} doors, trunks and hoods are joined via hem flange bonding. During the hemming process, air-filled cavities can form within the bonded hem flange, {{which in turn}} can lead to blisters forming in the PVC seam seal. Since the seam seal remains visible, the blisters adversely affect the optical quality of the end product. Besides this, {{there is a risk}} that these defects further develop by mechanical effects during the vehicle lifetime, which would allow direct access of electrolytes into the flange leading to the disruption of the corrosion protection for the bonded hem flange. To avoid the latter, any defect in the seam seal during their manufacture has to be repaired, a step involving time-consuming and cost-intensive finishing work. In order to avoid the costs associated with repairs, more intensive quality control, and potential damage of the manufacturer’s reputation in case severe corrosion issues arise, appropriate measures have to be taken. The research project summarized herein investigates the mechanisms of defect formation; based on the observations it suggests measures to minimize such defects, and ultimately allowing to produce <b>blister-free</b> seam seals. This report describes the results of the FOSTA research project P 909 carried out jointly by Fraunhofer IFAM and Fraunhofer IWU. The objective of this project was to develop the technological basis for the industrial manufacture of <b>blister-free</b> bonded hem flanges. The project involved two complementary approaches: minimization of cavities within the bonded hem flange through process optimization (minimization of the damage potential), and substitution of the defect-prone PVC plastisol by a <b>blister-free</b> seam sealant by means of material optimization and enhancement of the damage tolerance...|$|E
40|$|For {{tungsten}} {{exposed to}} low-energy hydrogen-plasmas, {{it has been}} thought that grains with 〈 1 1 1 〉 surface normal are most susceptible to blistering while those with 〈 0 0 1 〉 surface normal are virtually impervious to it. Here, we report results showing that non-uniformity of blister distribution depends {{on the state of}} the surface due to polishing. In electrochemically polished material blisters appear on the grains with all orientations, while in mechanically polished material <b>blister-free</b> areas associated with particular orientations emerge. On the other hand, blistering is shown to have a strong dependence on the level of deformation within particular grains in partially recrystallized material...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAtomic layer {{deposition}} (ALD) of thin Al 2 O 3 (≤ 10 nm) films is used {{to improve}} both front and rear surface passivation of large-area screen-printed p-type CZ Si passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC). As emitter passivation, the SiNx anti reflection coating (ARC) is capped with Al 2 O 3, giving improved hydrogenation during co-firing and a front recombination current (J 0,front) of 128 ± 5 fA/cm 2. As rear surface passivation, a <b>blister-free</b> stack of Al 2 O 3 /SiOx/SiNx is employed, leading to optimal back reflection and a rear recombination current (J 0,rear) of 92 ± 6 fA/cm 2. Internal quantum efficiency (IQE) measurements clearly confirm the improved passivation properties of both Al 2 O 3 -based stacks, even compared to passivation stacks based on thermally grown SiO 2...|$|E
40|$|Several {{polymeric}} coatings are dried by blowing jets {{of hot air}} on {{them from}} {{the top and bottom}} sides in multizone dryers. The goal of quickly removing solvent from a coating by manipulating air flow and temperature, together called operating conditions in this work, conflicts with the goal of producing <b>blister-free</b> coatings. Optimum operating conditions ensure both minimum residual solvent and no defects. Determining optimum conditions for multizone dryers is a difficult task with severe convergence problems. In this work, an easy method is developed to determine near-optimum operating conditions and residence times. The results indicate that the air flow on the top side should always be lower than or equal to that on the bottom side; the minimum residence time in first zone should be such that, toward the end, the solvent concentration starts to fall at the bottom. As long as the residence times are reasonably long, several different combinations of residence times in the second and subsequent zones nearly minimize residual solvent...|$|E
40|$|Dispersion-strengthened copper, Glidcop, {{is widely}} used {{in the design of}} high-heat-load, ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) {{components}} for synchrotron light sources. Furnace brazing of Glidcop to stainless steel or oxygen-free copper (OFC) for UHV service is usually done with gold-copper alloys in a reducing atmosphere of hydrogen. Copper plating of Glidcop, in a cyanide-copper bath, has been recommended to facilitate the quality of the braze joints by preventing diffusion of the braze alloy into the Glidcop base material. The copper-plating process however, introduces additional steps in the manufacturing process in addition to steps that are needed to insure <b>blister-free</b> plating. A series of experiments for brazing AL- 15 Glidcop with and without copper plating was conducted recently at Argonne National Laboratory Central Shops under the direction and funding of the Advanced Photon Source. Glidcop-to-OFC and Glidcop-to-stainless-steel braze joints were analyzed for structural strength and joint integrity for use in UHV service. In addition, an investigation was done to examine the re-exposure of Glidcop-to-OFC braze joints to thermal cycles, which would represent a second brazing cycle for components that require a multi-step brazing process for fabrication. The results of these brazing experiments are discussed in this paper. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this study, thermal atomic layer {{deposition}} (ALD) of Al 2 O 3 is (1) first {{characterized as}} surface passivation layer for p-type CZ Si and (2) accordingly implemented into industrial large-area passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) p-type Si solar cells. (1) The characterization part is focused on relevant topics for Si solar cell processing: {{the development of an}} adequate pre-passivation wafer clean and an in depth study of the impact of thermal treatments on (i) Al 2 O 3 passivation characteristics - chemical and field effect passivation - and (ii) Al 2 O 3 material characteristics - crystallization and blistering. (2) As rear surface passivation for industrial large-area p-type Si PERC, a <b>blister-free</b> stack of Al 2 O 3 (&# 8804; 10 nm) /(SiOx/) SiNx is employed, leading to optimal rear surface passivation and back reflection. An average cell conversion efficiency of 19. 4 % has been obtained, as independently confirmed by FhG-ISE CalLab. The illumination independency, an important advantage of Al 2 O 3 rear passivated p-type Si PERC, is discussed in detail. Two alternative approaches to implement Al 2 O 3 layers in Si solar cell processing are proposed as well: Al 2 O 3 -based emitter passivation and rear contacting induced by blistered Al 2 O 3 passivation layers. nrpages: 159 status: publishe...|$|E
