40|$|Abstract: In India, child {{mortality}} rates for girls {{are much higher}} than those for boys, indicating discrimination against girls in the intra-household allocation of resources. In addition, overall {{child mortality}} rates remain high {{in many parts of}} the country. This paper attempts to understand important predictors of <b>both</b> <b>child</b> and excessive female child mortality in India, with a focus on variables relating to maternal agency and education. Attempts are made to isolate the precise channels through which mother’s education influences survival probabilities of children, particularly, girls in India. Overall education effects are decomposed into autonomy, information and other effects and then regressed on child and excessive female child mortality variables in India. It is found that while information effects of education are important in <b>both</b> <b>child</b> mortality and excess female child mortality regressions; autonomy enhancing effects of education are much more important in predicting excess female child mortality than child mortality as a whole. In addition, even after controlling for autonomy and information effects, education significantly and negatively affects <b>both</b> <b>child</b> and excessive female child mortality, indicating that other direct benefits of education (beyond information an...|$|R

5|$|Although Weston and Stafford {{had known}} each other since their {{introduction}} at the King Sisters' party, they did not become romantically involved until 1945, when Weston traveled to New York to see Stafford perform at La Martinique. They were married in a Roman Catholic ceremony on February 26, 1952, before which Stafford converted to Catholicism. The wedding was conducted at St Gregory's Catholic Church in Los Angeles by Father Joe Kearney, a former guitarist with the Bob Crosby band who left the music business, trained as a priest and served as head of the Catholic Labor Institute. The couple left for Europe for a combined honeymoon and business trip: Stafford had an engagement at the London Palladium. Stafford and Weston had two children: Tim was born in 1952, and Amy in 1956. <b>Both</b> <b>children</b> followed their parents into the music industry. Tim Weston became an arranger and producer who took charge of Corinthian Records, his father's music label, and Amy Weston became a session singer, performing with a trio, Daddy's Money, and singing in commercials.|$|E
5|$|Kidnapping is also {{a common}} theme in such folklore.

5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of gastroenteritis in <b>both</b> <b>children</b> and adults is rehydration. This is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution, although intravenous delivery {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe. Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on simple sugars. Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase diarrhea. Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or the person is not willing to drink them. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted. In those who require intravenous fluids, one to four hours' worth is often sufficient.|$|E
