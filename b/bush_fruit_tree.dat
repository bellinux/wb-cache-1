The friends, for so we may now term them, were fain, therefore, to escape from the society of these persons, all of them born gentlewomen, who thought themselves but ill assorted with a burgher's daughter and a strolling glee maiden, and saw them with pleasure go out to walk in the neighbourhood of the convent.

40|$|<b>Fruit</b> <b>trees</b> are {{essential}} components {{of different types}} of greenery, including not only private gardens but also historical and modern public parks and gardens of many other cities. The research was carried out in spring 2016 by visiting different parks. <b>Fruit</b> <b>trees</b> were identified in 22 public parks of Warsaw situated in different districts of the city and picked up randomly for preliminary study. Observations were made by photographic documentation and mapping of the <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> on park plans using GPS coordinates which were taken during the site visit and Google Earth maps. According to the observations, selected <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> compositions have been recognized in public parks of Warsaw.

The results of the preliminary study show that the most frequent <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> compositions used in the structure of selected public parks of Warsaw represent groups of trees - groups that consist of <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> and different species of ornamental shrubs.

40|$|Conventional {{breeding}} of temperate <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> is constrained by their extensive reproductive cycle with long juvenile periods, complex reproductive biology, and {{high degree of}} heterozygosity. As the commercial production of transgenic annual crops becomes a reality {{in many parts of}} the world, the question remains whether genetically engineering <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> will find commercial application. Gene transfer for <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> improvement has several inherent advantages. Once a useful transformant is isolated, vegetative propagation, which is the normal method of multiplying <b>fruit</b> <b>trees,</b> provides unlimited production of the desired transgenic line. Fixation through the sexual cycle is unnecessary and inconvenient if commercially-accepted cultivars are transformed. Since production of most <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> species is based on a few cultivars, the impact of transforming one of them would be significant.

40|$|We {{developed}} two indicators {{to assess}} the exposure of residents to agricultural pesticide use and applied it in a case-control study on bladder cancer {{in the province of}} Limburg, Belgium. The first indicator used a distance-weighted measure of crop area for specified crops (<b>fruit</b> <b>trees,</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>bushes</b> and vegetables). The second indicator used a distance-weighted measure of pesticide use. We used information at three scale levels: (a) information at individual's level, such as distance to crop fields; (b) information {{at the level of the}} municipality, such as time-series of crop area; and (c) regional information, such as pesticide use. Pesticide use data were available per group of pesticides (fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, growth regulators and group of other pesticides). Indicators were calculated for each individual in the case-control study. The indicators were calculated per year for a period of 20 years, taking into account address history. Variation of pesticide use and toxicity with time was addressed by a relative risk factor. A very strong correlation was found between the area of <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> and <b>bushes</b> and the use of fungicides as well as the use of "other pesticides", indicating that these groups of pesticides are predominantly used in fruit production. The indicator for <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> is highly skewed to the right, indicating a high number of subjects with low potential exposure to <b>fruit</b> <b>trees.</b> Pesticide pressure indicators are less skewed as they combine application to multiple crops; the highest skewness is found for fungicides corresponding with the distribution for <b>fruit</b> <b>trees.</b> Statistical analysis revealed no association between the indicators and the incidence of bladder cancer. The results show that, using GIS, it is possible to reconstruct potential environmental pesticide exposure accounting for changes in pesticide use, crop area and residence history. Validation of the method with measured exposure is considered essential in view of its future application in other studies. status: publishe...|$|R
