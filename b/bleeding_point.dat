50|$|Ongoing {{bleeding}} despite good nasal packing is {{a surgical}} emergency {{and can be}} treated by endoscopic evaluation of the nasal cavity under general anaesthesia to identify an elusive <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> or to directly ligate (tie off) the blood vessels supplying the nose. These blood vessels include the sphenopalatine, anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries. More rarely the maxillary or {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery can be ligated. The bleeding can also be stopped by intra-arterial embolization using a catheter placed in the groin and threaded up the aorta to the bleeding vessel by an interventional radiologist. There is no difference in outcomes between embolization and ligation as treatment options, but embolization is considerably more expensive. Continued bleeding may be an indication of more serious underlying conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The major {{complications}} of endoscopic mucosal resection include postoperative bleeding, perforation, and stricture formation. During the procedure, an injection of 100,000 times diluted epinephrine into the muscular wall, along with high-frequency coagulation or clipping, {{can be applied}} to the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> for hemostasis. It is important to administer acid-reducing medications to prevent postoperative hemorrhage. Perforation may be prevented with sufficient saline injection to raise the mucosa containing the lesion. The [...] "nonlifting sign" [...] and complaints of pain when the snare strangulates the lesion are contrainidications of EMR. When perforation is recognized immediately after a procedure, the perforation should be closed by clips. Surgery should be considered in cases of endoscopic closure failure. The incidence of complications ranges from 0-50% and recurrence of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma range from 0-8%.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMassive pancreaticojejunal anastomotic bleeding, {{mainly from}} the {{gastroduodenal}} stump, {{is one of the}} most common complications of pancreatoduodenectomy. Selective angiography should be systematically the first step of investigative procedure in such situations. Pharmacoarteriography may be used if the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> is not spontaneously identified, and allows safe and effective treatment with transcatheter arterial embolization compared to blind open surgical hemostasis. Coil embolization of the common or proper hepatic artery on either side of the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> with "sandwich technique" is then the preferred technique to prevent retrograde filling. Surgery should be performed only as a last resort...|$|E
30|$|Regarding the {{angiography}} procedure itself, most authors {{described a}} standard approach via the common femoral artery (CFA). Under local anaesthesia in the groin, the CFA is punctured {{with a needle}} and a 4 or 5 French sheath is then introduced using the Seldinger technique to secure access into the arterial tree. Our local practice is to start with an aortogram to delineate the anatomy first, then guided by CT positive findings a direct catheterisation of the suspected internal iliac artery would follow. Contrast is then injected to identify the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point,</b> identified as a focus of contrast extravasation/blush. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is used to guide the operator along the arterial map (49). Standard catheter use is by default recommended at our institution. However, if the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> is not evident, further selective micro-catheterisation and angiogram of the pelvic arterial branches on the affected side is necessary to identify the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point.</b> Once this is evident, the bleeding artery is embolised accordingly {{using a variety of}} embolic material (e.g. micro-coils and/or glue), which is further discussed below.|$|E

We report a 10 -year-old girl who presented with massive hematemesis during recovery from a head injury caused by a motor vehicle accident. Prompt detection of the esophageal <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> by esophagoscopy followed by a balloon tamponade led to temporary hemostasis, during which time an emergency operation was prepared and started promptly. Two-staged surgery was performed with a successful outcome; direct vascular access to the right atrium and suturing of the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> of ARSA through a T-shaped skin incision with median sternotomy were performed in the first surgery, and dividing the ARSA and repairing the esophagus were performed in the second surgery on the following day.

30|$|We {{selected}} a thoracoscopic operation. Thymectomy was initiated under general anesthesia {{with the patient}} in the lithotomy position using a single-lumen tracheal tube. Thoracoscopic thymectomy was performed as previously reported [1]. Dissection of the lateral edge of the thymus was performed using the LigaSure Maryland (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) running along the phrenic nerve. The {{left side of the}} thymus was dissected after the right side. However, when the left upper edge of the thymus was dissected, bleeding suddenly occurred. Pressure was immediately applied to the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> with an instrument. We confirmed that hemostasis had almost been obtained and thymectomy was continued. Following thymectomy, the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> became obvious. We recognized a small tear in the orifice of the left internal thoracic vein flowing into the innominate vein. The amount of blood loss was only 10  g, but we were unable to suck the blood flowing {{into the bottom of the}} thoracic cavity completely. The total operation time was 165  min (Additional file 1).|$|E
40|$|Aortoesophageal fistulas are a rare but {{commonly}} fatal {{complication of}} esophageal cancer. Reports of successfully managed cases are few, with high mortality and morbidity usually resulting from failure {{to control the}} initial massive haemodynamic insult. We report {{the case of a}} 47 -year-old Caucasian man with recently diagnosed advanced esophageal cancer who suffered an episode of massive haematemesis. Emergency gastroscopy revealed an arterial <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> in the proximal esophagus. A self-expanding metal esophageal stent was placed to achieve initial partial haemostasis. CT angiography confirmed an aortoesophageal fistula. An endoluminal stent device was thus inserted within the thoracic aorta stabilising the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point.</b> The patient subsequently made an uneventful recovery and was discharged on long-term antibiotics for palliative care.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the collar graft (standard dacron graft with a customized flexible collar attached to the proximal rim) decreased anastomotic bleeding and the overall clamp time. DesignProspective randomised single center study. MethodsBetween November 2003 and January 2006, 21 patients were treated with a collar graft and 19 with a standard dacron graft. Routine endoaneurysmorraphy was used. Only infra-renal aneurysms between 5. 5 cm and 6. 5 cm were included. Aneurysms were diagnosed by CT scans. The total number of <b>bleeding</b> <b>points,</b> the total clamp time, and the number of teflon felt pledgets, was determined. ResultsThe total number of bleeding points; the number of aortic re-clamps and total clamp time (minutes) per patient were all significantly lower in the collar graft group (1. 2 versus 2, p< 0. 04; 0. 5 versus 2. 0, p< 0. 001; 13. 6 versus 20. 1, p< 0. 003 respectively). The number of teflon felt pledgets and new sutures used was significantly lower in the collar graft group (p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 003 respectively).

40|$|Abstract Introduction Although {{duodenal}} diverticula are common, periampullary duodenal diverticula are rare. Periampullary duodenal diverticula {{are usually}} asymptomatic {{and may be}} difficult to diagnose and treat. However, they may present with massive bleeding, requiring prompt diagnosis. Case presentation We report the case of a 71 -year-old Asian woman with bleeding from a periampullary duodenal diverticulum. She presented with severe anemia and tarry stools. Two examinations using a forward-viewing endoscope did not identify the source of the bleeding. However, examination using a side-viewing endoscope found an exposed bleeding vessel overlying the bile duct within a periampullary diverticulum of the descending part of the duodenum. The bleeding was successfully controlled by using hemostatic forceps. Conclusions Bleeding periampullary duodenal diverticula are rare, and a <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> in the mucosa overlying the bile duct within a large periampullary duodenal diverticulum is very rare. Identification of a <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> within a duodenal diverticulum often requires repeated examination and may require the use of a side-viewing endoscope. Use of hemostatic forceps to control bleeding from a periampullary duodenal diverticulum is very rare but, for bleeding lesions overlying the bile duct within a periampullary duodenal diverticulum, {{is the best way to}} prevent obstructive jaundice. </p...|$|E

40|$|An 81 -year-old {{man with}} {{alcoholic}} cirrhosis presented with hematemesis, melena, and hypotension. Examination revealed as-cites and chronic liver disease stigmata. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed multiple large columns of esophageal varices. No other bleeding sources were seen. Using a Cook 4, 6, 10 Shooter ® (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) multi-band ligator, the varix was ligated {{at the site}} of a platelet plug, which suggested recent hemorrhage (Figure 1). After blood extruded {{at the site of}} this defect, the ligated varix demonstrated the white ball sign (Figure 2). First described by Matsutani and colleagues, the white ball sign is observed after effective variceal ligation at the bleeding site. 1 – 3 It is hypothesized that the outflow of blood from the rupture point on the varix is the likely cause of this phenomenon. 1 – 3 Ligation at non-bleeding sites results in a purple ball appearance, representing congestion of blood in the variceal vessels captured by the band. 3 Other authors have noted that the white ball sign also occurs with ligation of the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> on esophogogastric varices. 3 In the setting of variceal bleeding where the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> is obscure, the white ball sign is particularly useful in confirming effective ligation. ...|$|E
