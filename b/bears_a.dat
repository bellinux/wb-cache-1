50|$|Completed in 1980, Bear Country {{replaced}} the zoo's historic bear pits originally constructed in 1874. Bear Country currently features four bear species: sloth <b>bears,</b> <b>an</b> Asiatic black <b>bear,</b> <b>an</b> Andean <b>bear,</b> and <b>a</b> rare polar <b>bear.</b>|$|R
5|$|The novel {{follows the}} {{adventure}} of four <b>bears,</b> Kallik (<b>a</b> polar <b>bear),</b> Lusa (<b>a</b> black <b>bear),</b> Toklo (<b>a</b> brown <b>bear)</b> and Ujurak (<b>a</b> brown <b>bear).</b>|$|R
25|$|Once <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> claims <b>an</b> animal carcass, {{it becomes}} very {{protective}} of its kill. This becomes a problem when <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> claims <b>a</b> hunter's kill, as the hunter may not wish to kill the bear as well. By avoiding <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> over <b>a</b> carcass, the risk of attack is reduced by around fifty percent.|$|R

5|$|Only one seal <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> well-preserved {{complete}} row {{of names}} or titles; the seal, numbered UC-11755, is undated {{and is now}} {{on display in the}} Petrie Museum, London. The inscription alternates between Horus and Golden Horus names.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> gorilla <b>bear</b> is <b>a</b> {{creature}} with the head, body and {{legs of a}} gorilla with the sharp teeth and powerful arms of <b>a</b> <b>bear.</b> <b>A</b> gorilla <b>bear</b> has <b>a</b> grizzly <b>bear's</b> aggressive disposition and <b>a</b> cave <b>bear's</b> carnivorous tendencies.|$|R
50|$|In 1946, the Allied {{headquarters}} {{published a}} series of stamps, the so-called „Bärenmarken“, {{for the whole of}} Berlin. The graphic designers Alfred Goldhammer and Heinz Schwalbe created four images with symbols of the reconstruction, e.g. <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> with <b>a</b> brick, <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> with <b>a</b> shovel, <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> with <b>a</b> beam and a young oak tree in front of the ruins at Belle-Alliance square.|$|R
25|$|The {{producing}} mint of each coin may {{be easily}} identified, as most coins <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> mint mark. The identifying {{letter of the}} mint {{can be found on}} the front side of most coins, and is often placed near the year. Unmarked coins are issued by the Philadelphia mint. Among marked coins, Philadelphia coins <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> letter P. Denver coins <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> letter D, San Francisco coins <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> letter S, and West Point coins <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> letter W. S and W coins are rarely, if ever, found in general circulation, although S coins bearing dates prior to the mid-1970s are in circulation. The CC, O, C, and D mint marks were used on gold and silver coins for various periods in the mid-nineteenth century until the early twentieth century by temporary mints in Carson City, Nevada; New Orleans, Louisiana; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Dahlonega, Georgia; respectively: most such coins still extant are now in the hands of collectors and museums.|$|R
5|$|Stela 29 <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> Long Count (8.12.14.8.15) date {{equivalent}} to AD 292, the earliest surviving Long Count {{date from the}} Maya lowlands. The stela is also the earliest monument to bear the Tikal emblem glyph. It <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> sculpture of the king facing to the right, holding {{the head of an}} underworld jaguar god, one of the patron deities of the city. The stela was deliberately smashed during the 6th century or some time later, the upper portion was dragged away and dumped in a rubbish tip close to Temple III, to be uncovered by archaeologists in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Stela 50 {{is one of}} {{the last}} monuments erected during the final decline of the city. It <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> crude, clumsily {{executed}} portrait.|$|E
5|$|Stela M <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> {{portrait}} of K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil. It was raised {{at the foot}} of the Hieroglyphic Stairway of Temple26 in AD756.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, Vu Lan is {{also seen}} as Mother's Day. People with living mothers would <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> red rose and would give thanks while those without {{can choose to}} <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> white rose; and attend {{services}} to pray for the deceased.|$|R

5|$|The Mangalorean Catholic dialect {{is largely}} {{derived from the}} Bardeskaar (North Goan) dialect and <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> good degree of {{intelligibility}} with the modern Bardeskaar dialect (spoken by North Goan Christians, North Goan Hindus, and South Goan Hindus) and to a slightly lesser extent with the standard Konkani dialect. It consequently differs from the dialect spoken by the Goud Saraswat Brahmins in South Canara, which is copiously derived and <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> good degree of intelligibility with the modern Sashtikaar (South Goan) dialect spoken by South Goan Christians and North Canara Konkani Hindus. It is {{much closer to the}} dialects of the Goan Hindus than to that of the Goan Catholics.|$|E
5|$|The {{anticoagulant}} rivaroxaban (Xarelto) <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> striking structural {{similarity to}} linezolid; both drugs share the oxazolidinone pharmacophore, differing in only three areas (an extra ketone and chlorothiophene, and missing the fluorine atom). However this similarity appears to carry no clinical significance.|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{is made up}} {{of twelve}} body {{segments}}, the last of which is fused to the first segment of the abdomen. There is no carapace, but each of the eleven free segments <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> pair of phyllopodia, which have a series of bristles pointing along the animal's midline. The abdomen consists of seven segments without appendages, and a slender telson which <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> pair of caudal rami.|$|E

5|$|Waptia fieldensis is {{the only}} species {{classified}} under the genus Waptia. Although it <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> remarkable resemblance to modern crustaceans, its taxonomic affinities remain unclear. It is currently classified as a stem group crustacean and tentatively included in the clade Crustaceomorpha.|$|E
5|$|Chicago {{tight end}} John Gilmore picked up Vinatieri's {{bouncing}} kickoff {{and returned it}} 9-yards to his own 45-yard line, with an unnecessary roughness penalty on Mathis adding another 15yards and giving the <b>Bears</b> <b>a</b> first down on the Colts' 40-yard line. Chicago could only gain 14yards on their ensuing possession, {{but it was enough}} for Robbie Gould to make a 44-yard field goal, cutting the score to 22–17.|$|E
5|$|Exmoor {{also has}} a henge located near to Parracombe, {{although}} it has been damaged by ploughing. Alongside this, the moor <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> profusion of other Bronze Age monuments, including between 300 and 400 round barrows, standing stones, and linear stone settings. The creation of these different monument types might explain why so few stone circles were apparently created here.|$|E
30|$|Thus the {{colloidal}} gold particles <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> negative charge (Fig. 4) and the amino acids <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> positive charge (Fig. 5 c). The electrostatic attraction {{between the two}} chemical entities {{is responsible for the}} adherence of gold particles on amino acid, protein and peptide content of sweat residue.|$|R
50|$|Horse archery is the {{earliest}} form of cavalry weaponry. The Iron Age horse was {{not strong enough}} to <b>bear</b> <b>an</b> armoured rider, being little larger than modern ponies. Horse archers replaced the Bronze Age chariot, which allowed mobile attacks even with horses too small to <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> man.|$|R

5|$|His grave <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> one-word epitaph: Undefeated. It is {{understood}} {{that after the}} war, Hans-Joachim Marseille's remains were brought from Derna and reinterred in the memorial gardens at Tobruk; {{it was there that}} his mother visited his grave in 1954. His remains are now in a small clay coffin (sarcophagus) bearing the number 4133.|$|E
5|$|M. l. leucopterus is {{restricted}} to Dirk Hartog Island, off the western coast of Australia, and nuptial males display black-and-white plumage. This subspecies is {{the smallest of the}} three and <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> proportionally longer tail. It was collected again in 1916 by Tom Carter, 98years after de Freycinet's expedition collected the type specimen.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{visits a}} Seattle hospital {{to pick up}} his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher), who works there as a counsellor. Rothenburg is brought in on a stretcher by paramedics. Black notices a peculiar slash across her palm, and glances down at his own, which <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> scar matching the woman's cut exactly. Rothenburg then dies of her injuries.|$|E
