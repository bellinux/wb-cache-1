Such a description is more realistic than the assumptions used in our past study [4]. We simulate 4 Martian rotations at three different seasons. The horizontal variations of the hydrogen density at the exobase are reduced when the exospheric <b>balistic</b> transport is included compared to our previous simulations...|$|E

After recalling how an electron-soliton bound state (solectron) can be formed we comment on consequences like electron surfing on a sound wave and <b>balistic</b> transport, possible percolation in 2 d lattices, and a novel form of electron pairing with strongly correlated electrons both in real space and momentum space.

40|$|A general simple {{theory for}} the {{allometric}} scaling is {{developed in the}} $d+ 1 $-dimensional space ($d$ biological lengths and a physiological time) of metabolic states of organisms. It is assumed that natural selection shaped the metabolic states {{in such a way}} that the mass and energy $d+ 1 $-densities are size-invariant quantities (independent of body mass). The different metabolic states (basal and maximum) are described by considering that the biological lengths and the physiological time are related by different transport processes of energy and mass. In the basal metabolism, transportation occurs by <b>balistic</b> and diffusion processes. In $d= 3 $, the 3 / 4 law occurs if the <b>balistic</b> movement is the dominant process, while the 2 / 3 law appears when both transport processes are equivalent. Accelerated movement during the biological time is related to the maximum aerobic sustained metabolism, which is characterized by the scaling exponent $ 2 d/(2 d+ 1) $ (6 / 7 in $d= 3 $). The results are in good agreement with empirical data...|$|E
40|$|A {{theory is}} {{developed}} for the stagnation point boundary layer with injection under the hypothesis that turbulence is produced at the wall by injection. From the existing experimental heat transfer rate data obtained in wind tunnels, the wall mixing length is deduced to be {{a product of a}} time constant and an injection velocity. The theory reproduces the observed increase in heat transfer rates at high injection rates. For graphite and carbon-carbon composite, the time constant is determined to be 0. 0002 sec from the existing ablation data taken in an arc-jet tunnel and a <b>balistic</b> range...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the results of thermodynamical calculations and investigations of the thermochemical and <b>balistic</b> properties of aluminized composite solid propellants Binder/AP/A 1 containing FOX- 7. The calculation was conducted by using ICT-Thermodynamic Code. The heat of combustion was determined in a stationary bomb calorimeter IKA C 4000. The breakdown temperatures were taken with the DTA 551 Ex measuring apparatus and the burning rate was measured in a subscale rocket motor utilizing the ESAM v. 3. 3. 0 system. It was revealed that the introduction of FOX- 7 into the propellant composition causes a reduction of the energetic characteristics and the burning rate of the propellant...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{engineering}} (GI) {{of plants}} {{is a very}} current topic, {{and more and more}} controversial, since it is becoming an inseparable part of our lives. GI has, among other things, a great potential to help solve the current problem of hunger and malnutrition in certain parts of the world. The goal of this project is to clarify what genetically modified (GM) plants are, to present the possibilities of their practical use, to explain methods of preparation and to consider their advantages and eventual risks. By GM plant we understand a plant whose genetic information has been changed by introducing or removing part of the genetic information (a section of DNA, generally a gene). The most frequently used methods of transformation are the transformation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the <b>balistic</b> method. GM plants can be used for production of food or feed in better quality and greater quantity, thanks to an introduction of higher resistance, whether it is to biotic stress (pest, virus or bacterial resistance) or to abiotic stress (drought, salinity, toxic substance in the ground [...] ). In particular, the resistance to abiotic stress is an important issue these days, since through the climate changes some regions suffer more and more from insufficient precipitation and consequent drought. Some of the GM plants grown [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Flutter Analysis of RX- 420 <b>Balistic</b> Rocket Fin Involving Rigid Body Modes of Rocket Structures. Flutter is a {{phenomenon}} that has brought a catastrophic failure to the flight vehicle structure. In this experiment, flutter was analyzed for its symmetric and antisymmetric configuration to understand the effect of rocket rigid modes to the fin flutter characteristic. This research was also expected {{to find out the}} safety level of RX- 420 structure design. The analysis was performed using half rocket model. Fin structure used in this research was a fin which has semispan 600 mm, thickness 12 mm, chord root 700 mm, chord tip 400 mm, made by Al 6061 -T 651, double spar configuration with skin thickness of 2 mm. Structural dynamics and flutter stability were analyzed using finite element software implemented on MSC. Nastran. The analysis shows that the antisymmetric flutter mode is more critical than symmetric flutter mode. At sea level altitude, antisymmetric flutter occurs at 6. 4 Mach, and symmetric flutter occurs at 10. 15 Mach. Compared to maximum speed of RX- 420 which is 4. 5 Mach at altitude 11 km or equivalent to 2. 1 Mach at sea level, it can be concluded that the RX- 420 structure design is safe, and flutter will not occur during flight...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} searcher {{needs to}} balance properly the tradeoff between {{the exploration of}} new spatial areas and the exploitation of nearby resources, an idea {{which is at the}} core of scale-free Lévy search strategies. Here we study multi-scale random walks as an approximation to the scale- free case and derive the exact expressions for their mean-first passage times in a one-dimensional finite domain. This allows us to provide a complete analytical description of the dynamics driving the asymmetric regime, in which both nearby and faraway targets are available to the searcher. For this regime, we prove that the combination of only two movement scales can be enough to outperform both <b>balistic</b> and Lévy strategies. This two-scale strategy involves an optimal discrimination between the nearby and faraway targets, which is only possible by adjusting the range of values of the two movement scales to the typical distances between encounters. So, this optimization necessarily requires some prior information (albeit crude) about targets distances or distributions. Furthermore, we found that the incorporation of additional (three, four, [...] .) movement scales and its adjustment to target distances does not improve further the search efficiency. This allows us to claim that optimal random search strategies in the asymmetric regime actually arise through the informed combination of only two walk scales (related to the exploitative and the explorative scale, respectively), expanding on the well-known result that optimal strategies in strictly uninformed scenarios are achieved through Lévy paths (or, equivalently, through a hierarchical combination of multiple scales) ...|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{who study}} {{pointing}} facilitation {{have identified the}} ability to identify [...] during motion [...] the likely target of a user's pointing gesture, as a necessary precursor to pointing facilitation in modern computer interfaces. To address this need, we develop and analyze how {{an understanding of the}} underlying characteristics of motion can enhance our ability to predict the target or endpoint of a goal-directed movement in graphical user interfaces. Using established laws of motion and an analysis of users' kinematic profiles, we demonstrate that the initial 90 % of motion is primarly <b>balistic</b> and submovements are limited to the last 10 % of gesture movement. Through experimentation, we demonstrate that target constraint and the intended use of a target has either a minimal effect on the motion profile or affects the last 10 % of motion. Therefore, we demonstrate that any technique that models the intial 90 % of gesture motion will not be affected by target constraint or intended use. Given, these results, we develop a technique to model the initial ballistic motion to predict user endpoint by adopting principles from the minimum jerk principle. Based on this principle, we derive an equation to model the initial ballistic phase of movement in order to predict movement distance and direction. We demonstrate through experimentation that we can successfully model pointing motion to identify a region of likely targets on the computer display. Next, we characterize the effects of target size and target distance on prediction accuracy. We demonstrate that there exists a linear relationship between prediction accuracy and target distance and that this relationship can be leveraged to create a probabilistic model for each target on the computer display. We then demonstrate how these probabilities could be used to enable pointing facilitation in modern computer interfaces. Finally, we demonstrate that the results from our evaluation of our technique are supported by the current motor control literature. In addition, we show that our technique provides optimal accuracy for any optimal accuracy when prediction of motion endpoint is performed using only the ballistic components of motion and before 90 % of motion distance...|$|E
40|$|A {{relation}} between the mound evolution and large-wavelength fluctuations at CdTe surface has been established. One finds that short-length scales are dictated by an interplay between {{the effects of the}} for- mation of defects at colided boundaries of neighboring grains and a relaxation process which stems from the diffusion and deposition of particles (CdTe molecules) torward these regions. A Kinetic Monte Carlo model corroborates these reasonings. As T is increased, that competition gives rise to different scenarios in the roughening scaling such as: uncorrelated growth, a crossover from random to correlated growth and tran- sient anomalous scaling. In particular, for T = 250 ºC, one shows that fluctuations of CdTe surface are described by the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, in the meantime that, the universality of height, local roughness and maximal height distributions for the KPZ class is, finally, experimentally demonstrated. The dynamic of fluctuations at the CdTe surface for other temperatures still is described by the KPZ equation, but with different values for the superficial tension (u) and excess of velocity (A). Namely, for T = 150 ºC one finds a Poissonian growth that indicates 1 / = A = O. For T : ZOOºC, however, a Random-to-KPZ crossover is found, vvith A > 0 in the second regime. The origin of the KPZ scaling for films grown at T 6 [200, 250] ºC stems from a complex dynamic of grain packing during vvhich all available space at the neighborhood of grains are not filled. This aggregation mechanism has the same effect of the lateral aggregation of the <b>balistic</b> deposition model Which leads to an excess of velocity (A > O). Finally, for films grown at T = 300 ºC one demonstrates that a KPZ grovvth vvith A 0 neste segundo regime. A origem da escala KPZ para filmes crescidos a T E [200, 250] ºC decorre da complexa dinâmica de empacotamento dos grãos durante a qual espaços nas vizinhanças dos mesmos não são totalmente preenchidos. Esse mecanismo de agregação tem o mesmo efeito da agregação lateral do modelo de deposição balística o qual leva a um excesso de velocidade (A > 0). Finalmente, para filmes crescidos a T = 300 ºC demonstra-se que A < 0. Em particular, o mecanismo KPZ para filmes crescidos a esta temperatura decorre da alta taxa de recusa da deposição de partículas, a qual e dependente das inclinações locais. Este fenômeno pode ser explicado em termos do coeficiente de sticking, o qual e tão pequeno quão mais localmente inclinada for a superfície. Devido a efeitos de tempo-finito (crossover temporais e escala anômala) ocorrendo em T = 200 ºC e 300 ºC, expoentes de escala falham em revelar a Classe de Universalidade do crescimento. Contudo, um novo método desenvolvido, que avança sobre a simples comparação entre expoentes e seus valores teoricamente esperados, permite-nos concluir que o crescimento de CdTe, em uma ampla faixa de temperatura, pertence a classe KPZ...|$|E
