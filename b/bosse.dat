5|$|The Central African Republic sent three {{competitors}} to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Béranger <b>Bosse</b> and Mireille Derebona represented {{the nation in}} track events, while Bruno Bongongo participated on the Central African Republic's behalf in boxing. Of those athletes, none progressed past the first rounds of their events. The appearance of the Central African delegation at the Beijing Olympics marked its eighth appearance since the nation's debut at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City and its seventh consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics. At the ceremonies, Derebona was the nation's flag bearer.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of ambitious and {{successful}} free-lance acting, <b>Bosse</b> found her options narrowing in the 1930s. The Great Depression brought her economic hardship, and, even though she looked younger than her age, most important women's roles were out of her age range. Her technique was still often praised, but also sometimes perceived as old-fashioned and mannered, {{in comparison with the}} more ensemble-oriented style of the times. Finding herself unneeded by any Swedish repertory theatre, she only managed to return as a member of Dramaten by means of skillful persuasion and pointed reminders of her long history there. A humble employee at a humble salary, she played only fifteen roles, all minor, during her last ten years at Dramaten, 1933–43.|$|E

5|$|Suwaibou Sanneh was {{the only}} male athlete {{representing}} The Gambia at the London Olympics. He previously competed in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. Sanneh qualified for the London Olympics by securing the required qualifying time in the 'B' standard in an event in Jamaica. He competed in the men's 100 metres race on 4 August in the third heat of the quarter-finals, finishing fifth out of eight athletes {{with a time of}} 10.21 seconds. Sanneh became the first Gambian athlete to qualify for the semi-finals of the event, and the second time a competitor from the country advanced into the semi-finals of any Olympic event. He ranked ahead of Rytis Sakalauskas from Lithuania (10.29 seconds), Central Africa's Béranger-Aymard <b>Bossé</b> (10.55 seconds) and Bruno Rojas of Bolivia (10.65 seconds) in a heat led by American sprinter Ryan Bailey (9.88 seconds). In the semi-finals on 5 August, Sanneh achieved a Gambian national record of 10.18 seconds, but did not advance into the final after finishing eighth (and last) in her heat.|$|E
5|$|Schmittou {{and team}} owners arrived at terms in June 1984 to {{purchase}} the Triple-A Evansville Triplets of the American Association, with plans to move the franchise from Evansville, Indiana, to Nashville for the 1985 season. In order {{to prove to the}} team's Nashville banks, which would back the purchase, that the move was financially viable, Schmittou commissioned a survey to evaluate the potential turnout for a Triple-A team versus a Double-A team. Though the research proved to team owners that the move was a sensible decision, the banks were not impressed. As a result, the team switched banks and went ahead with the purchase and relocation. The Southern League wanted Schmittou to surrender his franchise to the league, but he had plans to relocate the team instead. Schmittou wanted to send Nashville's existing Southern League franchise to Evansville to continue as the Triplets at Double-A. However, a combination of the league's disapproval of the move and the City of Evansville being unwilling to upgrade <b>Bosse</b> Field resulted in a move to Huntsville, Alabama, where the team became the Huntsville Stars. The Triple-A Sounds carried {{on the history of the}} Double-A team that preceded it. The Triplets' legacy was retired, and the Stars were established as an entirely-new franchise.|$|E

25|$|Two-and-a-half {{years prior}} to the attack, <b>Bosse</b> had {{announced}} his intents on an Internet forum and asked for psychological help. He also posted pictures and videos from Airsoftspielen, as well as bomb-making videos, on a personal website. Additional photos on the website showed <b>Bosse</b> with a variety of weapons, including a submachine gun, in public. On Sunday evening before the attack, <b>Bosse</b> posted four videos on his website, in which he and another person operated with weapons and explosives. The site was closed immediately after the attack by the North Rhine-Westphalia police, but its contents were copied in response to the closing, being placed on a number of other websites. <b>Bosse</b> had planned the attack extensively, according to contents of his diary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bosse</b> {{purchased}} the percussion rifle from an online weapons dealer. The dealer confirmed that <b>Bosse</b> {{had participated in}} three online auctions during the two {{months prior to the}} attack; all three auctions sold weapons. However, the auctions only sold weapons to people aged over 18 years. Attorney Wolfgang Schweer confirmed to the WDR that no investigation was launched against the auctions. The bolt-action rifle that <b>Bosse</b> was armed with during the attack had been purchased by him from a 24-year-old male relative in exchange for an airsoft gun; the man was not aware of Bosse's true intent.|$|E
25|$|There were rumours in 2002 {{that the}} Action démocratique du Québec party had {{approached}} <b>Bossé</b> about running under its banner {{in the next}} provincial election. <b>Bossé</b> declined to comment.

25|$|Despite the {{opposition}} of <b>Bossé</b> and others, the island of Montreal was amalgamated into a single municipality in 2001.

25|$|In January 1998, <b>Bossé</b> succeeded Westmount mayor Peter Trent {{as head of}} the Conference of Suburban Mayors (later renamed as the Union of Suburban Mayors). In this capacity, <b>Bossé</b> {{introduced}} a plan to reform the MUC by giving more responsibility to the office of general manager while reducing the power of the chair. A editorial in the Gazette noted that this plan would have had the effect of weakening the MUC's powers, an outcome that the suburban mayors desired. The reforms were never approved, and the question became moot in light of subsequent events. In March 1998, <b>Bossé</b> was one of eleven MUC members to vote against Vera Danyluk's re-election as chair.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bosse</b> {{entered the}} school building, firing several more shots and {{wounding}} four students. He also lit several smoke bombs, filling the building up with smoke.

At 9:58 a.m., a special task force finally breached the school and searched the building, discovering the body of <b>Bosse</b> {{on the second floor}} at 10:36 a.m., 38 minutes after entry. <b>Bosse</b> had shot himself in the mouth, although it was initially unclear if he had shot himself or was killed by the detonation of an explosive device that was attached to his body. Explosive experts had to be brought in to defuse the explosives found strapped to his body, as well as additional explosives found around the school.|$|E
