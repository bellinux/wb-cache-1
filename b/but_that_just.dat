500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, Stefani's vocals range from E3 to D5, leading an instrumentation of piano, guitar, and backup singers. An acoustic guitar is featured during the track's interlude, which {{is accompanied by}} a repetitive drum beat. NME's Alex Needham compared the song's composition to Orbit's contributions on Madonna's seventh studio album, Ray of Light (1998). Lyrically, Stefani sings about being impatient in a lustful romance, which additionally serves as a [...] "central theme" [...] on Rock Steady. The singer turns down acts of kindness in a relationship: [...] "The flowers arrive to my surprise / <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> ain't good enough". It also mentions the recording's protagonist feeling a sort of lovesickness during a long-distance relationship, where she predicts: [...] "I anticipate us making out".|$|E
500|$|In AJ's first episode, {{he makes}} {{an enemy of}} Derek Branning when he and Masood crash a {{shopping}} trolley into his car. An insider said that AJ should be worried, explaining: [...] "AJ {{is a bit of}} a talker and tries to blag his way out of the situation <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> makes things even worse. Derek is quick to rough him up a little to make him realise he's not to be messed with. The confrontation really shocks AJ but he's not going to be pushed around by some bullying bloke he's just met." [...] The Daily Star said that [...] "Derek is the one person AJ really shouldn't make into an enemy", while interviewer Phillip Schofield stated: [...] "If you knock the wing mirror off Derek's Jag you are in for trouble." ...|$|E

6000|$|When {{the song}} and music were ended, the Interpreter asked Christiana {{what it was that}} first did move her to betake herself to a pilgrim's life. Christiana answered, [...] "First, the loss of my husband came into my mind, at which I was heartily grieved; but all that was but natural affection. Then, after that, came the {{troubles}} and pilgrimages of my husband into my mind, and also how unkindly I had behaved to him as to that. So guilt took hold of my mind, and would have drawn me into the pond, to drown myself, <b>but</b> <b>that,</b> <b>just</b> at the right time, I had a dream of the well-being of my husband, and a letter sent by the King of that country where my husband dwells, to come to him.

60|$|She {{sat down}} on a garden seat, under the shade of a wide-branching lime; he a little apart. But she could say nothing, albeit so much was in her heart, and her impulse had been so strong; so far as her power to express that strange emotion went, in the dark he would have to remain. She could not say to him--it was a feeling, not a thought--that her clear soul had taken some turbidness that was foreign to it from his; that when she forgot the past and his {{existence}} it settled and left her pure again; she could not say--the thought existed without form in her mind--that {{it would have been better}} if he had never been born because he had offended; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> because the offence had been against herself, something of the guilt seemed to attach itself to her, causing her to know remorse and shrink from herself; that it was somehow in his power--he having performed this miracle--to deliver her.|$|E
60|$|And {{what has}} this {{to do with}} God? Why does Joel tell these Jews that God sent the locusts, and bid them cry to God to take them away? For these locusts are natural things, and come by natural laws. And {{there is no need}} that there should be locusts anywhere. For where the wild grass plains are broken up and {{properly}} cultivated, there the locusts, which lay their countless eggs in the old turf, disappear, and must disappear. We know that now. We know that when the East is tilled (as God grant it may be some day) as thoroughly as England is, locusts will be as unknown there as here; and that is another comfortable proof to us that there is no real curse upon God's earth: <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> as far as man fulfils God's command to replenish the earth and subdue it, so far he gets rid of all manner of terrible scourges and curses, which seemed to him in the days of his ignorance, necessary and supernatural.|$|E
6000|$|The {{business}} men and financiers of the Pacific coast {{never forgot}} {{the lesson of}} Charles Klinkner and the California & Altamont Trust Company. Klinkner was the president. In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban. The powerful Lake Power & Electric Lighting corporation came to the rescue, and Klinkner, seeing {{what he thought was}} the opportunity, went over to the enemy {{in the thick of the}} pitched battle. Daylight lost three millions before he was done with it, and before he was done with it he saw the California & Altamont Trust Company hopelessly wrecked, and Charles Klinkner a suicide in a felon's cell. Not only did Daylight lose his grip on San Jose Interurban, but in the crash of his battle front he lost heavily all along the line. It was conceded by those competent to judge that he could have compromised and saved much. But, instead, he deliberately threw up the battle with San Jose Interurban and Lake Power, and, apparently defeated, with Napoleonic suddenness struck at Klinkner. It was the last unexpected thing Klinkner would have dreamed of, and Daylight knew it. He knew, further, that the California & Altamont Trust Company has an intrinsically sound institution, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> then it was in a precarious condition due to Klinkner's speculations with its money. He knew, also, that in a few months the Trust Company would be more firmly on its feet than ever, thanks to those same speculations, and that if he were to strike he must strike immediately. [...] "It's just that much money in pocket and a whole lot more," [...] he was reported to have said in connection with his heavy losses. [...] "It's just so much insurance against the future. Henceforth, men who go in with me on deals will think twice before they try to double-cross me, and then some." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{road from}} Annesley Bay to Koomaylo {{can hardly be}} termed either {{interesting}} or strongly defined. It at first goes straight across the sand, and, as the sand is trampled everywhere, it is simply impossible to follow it. We {{were told that the}} route lay due west, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> where the jungle began there was a sign-post. Compass in hand, we steered west, and entered the low thorny scrub which constitutes the jungle. No sign-post. We rode on for a mile, when, looking back at the rising sun, I saw something like a sign-post in the extreme distance. Riding back to it, it proved to be the desired guide, and the road from here is by daylight distinct enough. For the first six miles it runs across a dead-level of sand, covered with a shrub with very small and very scanty leaves, and very large and extremely-abundant thorns. Bustards, grouse, deer, and other game are said to be very abundant here, but we saw none of them. A sort of large hawk was very numerous, but these were the only birds we saw. At about six miles from the sea the ground rises abruptly for about ten feet in height, and this rise ran north and south {{as far as the eye}} could reach. It marked unquestionably the level of the sea at some not very remote period. From this point the plain continued flat, sandy, and bushy as before for two miles; but after that a rocky crag rose, rather to our right, and the sand became interspersed with stones and boulders. Our path lay round behind the hill, and then we could see, at about four miles’ distance, a white tent or two, at the mouth of an opening in the mountain before us. These white tents were the camp at Koomaylo. About three miles from Koomaylo we came upon a very curious burial-place. It was in a low flat, close to a gully, and covered a space of perhaps fifty yards square. The graves were placed very close together, and consisted of square piles of stones, not thrown together, but built up, about three feet square and as much high. They were crowned by a rough pyramid of stones, the top one being generally white. Underneath these stone piles was a sort of vault. From this point the ground rose more steeply than it had yet done.|$|E
