He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his father was not going to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|Saumarez sent Jahleel Brenton in a gig to Venerable at 08:00, {{just as the}} {{foremast}} also fell overboard, {{with instructions}} that if the combined French and Spanish squadron, visible off Cadiz, should proceed south to attack the grounded British vessel then Hood should remove his crew and set his ship on fire. Thames was brought close alongside in order to evacuate the ship if the need arose, but Hood refused the order and insisted that he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> his ship. Eventually the arrival of Audacious and Superb on the southern horizon decided the issue as Moreno abandoned any intention to counterattack, instead entering Cadiz harbour with his squadron, followed by Troude in Formidable. Their arrival was greeted with cheers from the city's population, unaware of the disaster in the Gut of Gibraltar. The confusion meant that the situations of the lost ships were unknown, and Saint Antoines arrival was still anticipated at Cadiz as late as 16 July.|$|E

As neither could properly die, Yūko grants their wishes to be reborn as normal humans, which Syaoran accepts because Sakura tells him {{she wants to}} stay with him. As both grow up as normal humans, they meet and live together. He and Sakura have a son, who is the original Syaoran, creating a time paradox.

25|$|However, by {{the time}} the Americans arrived and checked at Subig on April 30, they found no Spanish ships there. That was because Montojo had judged to {{position}} to be indefensible because they did not finish installing the naval guns on the ground at the entrance to Subig, being behind schedule—though according to American scouts, the guns were lying on the beach and could have been mounted in less than 24 hours. In addition, the wooden cruiser Castilla was having technical problems. Thus a council of squadron captains decided to return to Manila Bay. Reportedly, another factor in Admiral Montojo's decision was that they would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> Spanish sailors in the depth of forty meters of water at Subig, something which American naval officers found astounding. Thus the American squadron leader, Admiral George Dewey, and his other officers initially had a low opinion of the Spanish commander's abilities.|$|E

25|$|During the {{campaign}} for the governorship in 2002, Romney proposed a plan that he said would balance the Massachusetts budget without raising taxes.

Though less than a majority, some 40percent of the voters voted in favor of abolishing the income tax in a referendum held during the election that carried Romney into office; and in an April 2003 poll of Massachusetts residents, 57percent said Romney should not consider raising taxes as part of his plan to balance the budget.|$|E

2500|$|The {{denomination}} of {{two dollars}} was authorized under a congressional act, and first used in March 1862. The denomination was continuously used until the 1960s; {{by this time}} the United States Note was the only remaining class of U.S. currency the two dollar bill was assigned to. In 1966 it was decided to discontinue all two dollar United States Notes from production. The $2 bill initially was not reassigned to the Federal Reserve Note class of United States currency and was thus fully discontinued; the Treasury Department cited the $2 bill's low use and unpopularity as the reason for not immediately resuming use of the denomination. In 1976 production of the two-dollar denomination was resumed and the two-dollar bill was finally assigned as a Federal Reserve Note, with a new [...] reverse design featuring John Trumbull's depiction of the drafting of the United States Declaration of Independence replacing the previous design of Monticello. It has remained a current denomination since then. It was estimated that if the two-dollar bill replaced approximately half of the one-dollar bills in circulation, the federal government would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> about $26 million in 1976 dollars ($ adjusted for inflation) over the period from 1976 to 1981, due to reduced production, storage, and shipping costs.|$|E
2500|$|After {{passing the}} line of fire of the fortress' gun batteries, the cruiser was burning and {{severely}} damaged, but her captain still hoped he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> his ship. At this point, however, Blücher entered the sights of Kommandørkaptein Anderssen as she slid past the torpedo battery at a range of only [...] The torpedoes the retired officer was aiming at the cruiser were 40-year-old Whitehead weapons of Austro-Hungarian manufacture. These torpedoes had been practice-launched well over 200 times before, but no one was certain if they would function or not. As Kommandørkaptein Anderssen pushed the firing mechanism, at approximately 04:30, the weapons turned out to work perfectly, first one and then another torpedo raced out of their underwater exit tunnels at [...] below the surface toward the burning warship. As Anderssen had overestimated the speed of his target slightly, the first torpedo hit near Blüchers forward turret (nicknamed [...] "Anton"), creating only inconsequential damage. With the second torpedo launch the aim was corrected and the torpedo struck Blücher amidships, hitting the same general area as the first 28cm shell. This caused catastrophic damage to the cruiser and blew open many of her bulkheads, allowing water to flood her decks while she was burning furiously. The third torpedo launcher was left loaded in case more ships were to follow close behind Blücher. After firing, the two other tubes were reloaded and readied for the next target.|$|E

2500|$|Over the 20th century, trusts {{came to be}} {{used for}} {{multiple}} purposes beyond the classical role of parcelling out wealthy families' estates, wills, or charities. First, as more working-class people became more affluent, they began to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> for retirement through occupational pensions. After the Old Age Pensions Act 1908, everyone who worked and paid National Insurance would probably have access to the minimal state pension, but if people wanted to maintain their living standards, they would need more. Occupational pensions would typically be constituted through a trust deed, after being bargained for by a trade union under a collective agreement. After World War Two, the number of people with occupational pensions rose further, and gradually regulation was introduced to ensure that people's [...] "pension promise" [...] was protected. The settlor would usually be the employer and employee jointly, and the savings would be transferred to a trustee {{for the benefit of the}} employee. Most regulation, especially after the Robert Maxwell scandals and the Goode Report, was directed at ensuring that the employer cannot dominate, or abuse its position through undue influence over the trustee or the trust fund. The second main use of the trust came to be in other financial investments, though not necessarily for retirement. The unit trust, since their launch in 1931, became a popular vehicle for holding [...] "units" [...] in a fund that would invest in various assets, such as company shares, gilts or government bonds or corporate bonds. One person investing alone might not have much money to spread the risk of his or her investments, and so the unit trust offered an attractive way to pool many investors wealth, and share the profits (or losses). Nowadays, unit trusts have been mostly superseded by Open-ended investment companies, which do much the same thing, but are companies selling shares, rather than trusts. Nevertheless, trusts are widely used, and notorious in offshore trusts in [...] "tax havens", where people hire an accountant or lawyer to make an argument that shifting assets in some new way will avoid tax. The third main contemporary use of the trust has been in the family home, though not as an expressly declared trust. As gender inequality began to narrow, both partners to a marriage would often be contributing money, or work, to pay the mortgage, make their home, or raise children together. A number of members of the judiciary became active from the late 1960s in declaring that even if one partner was not on the legal title deeds, she or he would still have an equitable property interest in the home under a [...] "resulting trust" [...] or (more normally today) a [...] "constructive trust". In essence the courts would acknowledge the existence of a property right, without the trust being expressly declared. Some courts said it reflected an implicit common intention, while others said the use of the trust reflected the need to do justice. In this way, trusts continued to fulfill their historical function of mitigating strict legal rules in the interests of equity.|$|E
