5|$|Although he venerated Scott's {{writing skill}} {{and use of}} history as backdrop, Balzac worked to more {{accurately}} depict the turbulence {{of the human heart}} – and its effect on history. He considered Scott's view of women unrefined, and believed this led to a stale representation of human <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result. In Les Chouans, Balzac places the romance of Montauran and Marie de Verneuil {{at the center of the}} narrative, around which all other elements revolve.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all animals}} {{are capable of}} modifying their <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of experience—even the most {{primitive}} types of worms. Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain. Already in the late 19th century theorists like Santiago Ramón y Cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons. Until 1970, however, experimental {{evidence to support the}} synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking. In 1971 Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days. Since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process.|$|E
5|$|In Plans and the Structure of Behavior, Miller and his co-authors {{tried to}} explain through an artificial-intelligence {{computational}} perspective how animals plan and act. This was a radical break from behaviorism which explained <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> set or sequence of stimulus-response actions. The authors introduced a planning element controlling such actions. They saw all plans as being executed based on input using a stored or inherited information of the environment (called the image), and using a strategy called test-operate-test-exit (TOTE). The image was essentially a stored memory of all past context, akin to Tolman's cognitive map. The TOTE strategy, in its initial test phase, compared the input against the image; if there was incongruity the operate function attempted to reduce it. This cycle would be repeated till the incongruity vanished, and then the exit function would be invoked, passing control to another TOTE unit in a hierarchically arranged scheme.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{questioned}} whether some animals are instead using altruistic <b>behaviors</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> market strategy {{to trade for}} something desirable.

[...] The grooming was evenly balanced across multiple bouts rather than single bouts, suggesting that females are not constrained to complete exchanges with single transactions and use social grooming to solidify long term relationships with those in their social group.|$|R

This model is also the basis for the different BDD-supporting software tools that are available.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the job of}} {{preventing}} cheating {{has been given to}} the teacher. It used to be that in college the professor acted in loco parentis and was able to regulate student <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> parent. Thus, professors who discovered cheating could assign essentially any punishment they deemed appropriate. Students often had no mechanism for appeal. Generally, proctors were hired to patrol exams. If a case was particularly serious, a dean or other top-level administrator might have been involved. Against this inconsistent and paternalistic system, students at some schools rebelled and demanded to be treated as adults.|$|E

25|$|The Council of London in 1102 in 1102, {{called at}} the urging of Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, {{explicitly}} denounced homosexual <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sin {{for the first time at}} an English council. Anselm felt that sodomy was widespread and was not condemned strongly enough or regarded with the seriousness that it should have. Confessors were urged to take account of such ignorance when hearing confessions for sodomy, and to take into account mitigating factors such as age and marital status before prescribing penance; and counselling was generally preferred to punishment. In Canons 28 and 29 the Council decreed that the people should be informed of the gravity of the sin, and their obligation to confess (particularly if they derived pleasure from it). Nevertheless, Anselm deferred publication of the proceedings, arguing further time was needed to clarify certain matters. Boswell argues the decrees were never published at all.|$|E
25|$|While Charlie, Larry, and Dr. Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat), Charlie's {{girlfriend and}} colleague, develop their model, Larry {{receives}} {{a phone call}} informing him that {{he is no longer}} a part of the mission. At Charlie's house, Charlie and Amita learn from Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), Don and Charlie's father, that a MIT professor had asked NASA to look into Larry's recent <b>behavior.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of Larry's homelessness, NASA decided to pull Larry from the mission. FBI Special Agent David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) and Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno) take Brendan McCrary (George Newbern), a frequent visitor in the chat room that the molesters used, into custody. When the team questions McCrary, they learn, and further investigation confirms, that McCrary joined an online group which attempts to peacefully catch child molesters after his daughter was raped and murdered by one. While working on their model, Charlie tells Amita that he feels bad for being happy that Larry was not going to space, and Amita tells Charlie that he should not beat himself up over his emotions. Their analysis soon reveals that the killer's preferred houses are located in Megan's Law and Jessica's Law zones.|$|E

Captain America, upon learning of Hank's violence, tracks down and beats Hank unconscious for Janet. Captain America's visits Janet after the fight left her exasperated and angry, stemming from embarrassment of her personal life now being public. After stopping the Chitauri invasion, Captain America and Wasp reconcile as friends and slowly start dating, despite Hank's {{attempts at}} making amends. On one of their secret meetings, Janet later confesses to Hank, now classified as a security risk by S.H.I.E.L.D., that the generation gap between Captain America and herself, along with the elderly status of Steve's friends, put a large strain on their relationship. She walks out on Rogers and meets up with Hank in a bar.|$|E
