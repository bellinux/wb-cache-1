40|$|In this study, monthly {{settleable}} dust {{samples were}} collected in four seasons using the modified crude single open <b>bucket</b> <b>units</b> at five sites within the Vanderbijlpark area. The samples were captured in distilled water medium, filtered, air-dried, weighed to determine mass concentrations, digested with aqua regia acid solution and analyzed for heavy metals by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) 6000 Thermo-Electron model technique. The average ranges of ten metals identified were: zinc (Zn, 1. 12...|$|R

50|$|However, if the GCRA {{were to be}} used {{to limit}} to a bandwidth, rather than a packet/frame rate, in a {{protocol}} with variable length packets (Link Layer PDUs), it would involve multiplication: basically the value added to the bucket (or to TAT) for each conforming packet would have to be proportionate to the packet length: whereas, with the GCRA as described, the water in the <b>bucket</b> has <b>units</b> of time, for variable length packets it would have to have units that are the product of packet length and time. Hence, applying the GCRA to limit the bandwidth of variable length packets without access to a fast, hardware multiplier (as in an FPGA) may not be practical. However, it can always be used to limit the packet or cell rate, as long as their lengths are ignored.|$|R
40|$|Performance {{of three}} {{alternate}} arsenic removal technologies was evaluated in the laboratory. These were: (i) removal {{system based on}} alum and iron coagulation; (ii) removal system based on sorptive filtration using iron coated sand filter, and (iii) removal system based on sorptive filtration using gravel bed containing iron sludge. Based on laboratory performance, two technologies, ferric chloride coagulation, and sorptive filtration through iron-coated sand, were selected {{for the development of}} household arsenic removal units. The ferric chloride based unit is similar in design to the <b>bucket</b> treatment <b>unit</b> developed by DPHE-Danida. It involves precipitation of arsenic by adding a packet of coagulants to 25 liters of tubewell water and subsequent filtration of the water through a sand filter. The unit based on iron-coated sand has a pre-treatment system for removal of excess iron. This consists of a bucket where water is poured and stirred for sometime to accelerate precipitation of iron. The water then flows through a sand filter where the excess iron is filtered out. Finally th...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted on 18 th March to 23 rd April 2015 atBrackishwater Aquaculture Development Center Jepara, Central of Java. The aimof this research {{is to determine the}} optimum percentage of feed in shrimpsenlargement activity. The Completely Randomized Design was applied in thisresearch with one factor and three replication. Treatment consist of feed pellets; P 1 (15 % from biomass/day), P 2 (25 % from biomass/day), P 3 (35 % frombiomass/day), P 4 (45 % from biomass/day) and P 5 (55 % from biomass/day). Awhite shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) in length of 1, 62 cm and body weight of 0, 05 g were reared in <b>bucket</b> (15 <b>unit)</b> with 120 L capacity and density of 100 tail/bucket. During experiment, the shrimps were fed on pellets four times daily. The results showed that the different percentage of feed gave effect for whiteshrimp growth. The best percentage of feed is 25 % from biomass/day (P 2) wasoptimum and gave the total weight with 0, 934 g, total length 4, 042 cm, specificgrowth rate 9, 76 %, and survival rate with 95, 33 %...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 A geoarchaeological {{investigation}} {{was conducted at}} the Devils Kitchen archaeological site, located in the Devils Kitchen State Park along the southern Oregon coast. In this thesis research, the author paired previous and recent excavated stratigraphy profiles to define culturally significant deposits. These stratigraphic units were defined further geochemically using a multivariate statistical analysis from data gathered by a portable x-ray fluorescence. Radiocarbon dates from excavated charcoal samples associated with cultural artifacts show an intact deposit dating from 10, 638 ± 35 to 11, 596 ± 37 RCYBP. The author used textural analysis from Ro-Tap sieve shaker data and Munsell color identification extracted from 33 <b>bucket</b> auger <b>units</b> to subsurface test the Devils Kitchen State Park area. The auger samples portray an uplifted aeolian landscape once influenced by alluvial deposition, commonly observed along coastal environments altered by rising sea levels. This research applied a geoarchaeological method to identify deposits of the right age (DORA) that {{have the potential to}} contain intact, early evidence of prehistoric people. The identification of DORA can serve as a marker for future coastal research searching for rare, intact paleolandscapes and archaeological deposits dating to the late Pleistocene to mid Holocene...|$|R
40|$|In this {{extended}} abstract, {{we describe}} and analyse a streaming probabilistic sketch, HYPERMINHASH, {{to estimate the}} Jaccard index (or Jaccard similarity coefficient) over two sets A and B. HyperMinHash {{can be thought of}} as a compression of standard MinHash by building off of a HyperLogLog count-distinct sketch. Given Jaccard index δ, using k buckets of size O((l) + (|A ∪ B|)) (in practice, typically 2 bytes) per set, HyperMinHash streams over A and B and generates an estimate of the Jaccard index δ with error O(1 /l + √(k/δ)). This improves on the best previously known sketch, MinHash, which requires the same number of storage <b>units</b> (<b>buckets),</b> but using O((|A ∪ B|)) bit per bucket. For instance, our new algorithm allows estimating Jaccard indices of 0. 01 for set cardinalities on the order of 10 ^ 19 with relative error of around 5...|$|R
40|$|Coalition {{operations}} are increasingly effects-based, {{which means they}} apply force only as necessary to achieve political and psychological effects. Capture the Flag is a wargaming environment that includes intelligent, autonomous adversaries. Our planner previously focused on two goals: occupying objectives and attrition. But attrition is a means to the defeat of one’s enemies, not an end in itself. For Capture the Flag to plan for defeat, it needs a model of defeat. We model the “capacity for conflict ” as a leaky bucket: when a <b>unit’s</b> <b>bucket</b> is full, it has no more capacity for conflict and it capitulates. Flow {{into and out of}} the bucket is modulated by several factors including attrition and heroism. The model is inherently dynamical, so it exhibits the time-dependent behaviors one observes in real conflicts; for example, identical attacks will have different effects on capitulation as a function of their timing. ...|$|R
40|$|A solar-based {{intelligent}} {{water sprinkler}} system project {{that has been}} developed to ensure the effectiveness in watering the plant is improved by making the system automated. The control system consists of an electrical capacitance soil moisture sensor installed into the ground which is interfaced to a controller unit of Motorola 68 HC 11 Handy board microcontroller. The microcontroller was programmed based on the decision rules made using fuzzy logic approach on when to water the lawn. The whole system is powered up by the solar energy which is then interfaced to {{a particular type of}} irrigation timer for plant fertilizing schedule and rain detector through a simple design of rain dual-collector tipping <b>bucket.</b> The controller <b>unit</b> automatically disrupted voltage signals sent to the control valves whenever irrigation was not needed. Using this system we combined the logic implementation in the area of irrigation and weather sensing equipment, and more efficient water delivery can be made possible.  </p...|$|R
