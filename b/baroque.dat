5|$|While these {{characteristics}} never occur all {{together in the}} same building, and none are unique to Sicilian <b>Baroque,</b> it is the coupling together which gives the Sicilian <b>Baroque</b> its distinctive air. Other <b>Baroque</b> characteristics, such as broken pediments over windows, the extravagant use of statuary, and curved topped windows and doors are all emblematic of <b>Baroque</b> architecture, but can all be found on <b>Baroque</b> building all over Europe.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} early days of Sicilian <b>Baroque,</b> the first {{buildings}} of the new neoclassical era were often copies or hybrids of the two styles. The Palazzo Ducezio (Illustration 19) was begun in 1746, and the ground floor with arcades creating play of light and shadow is pure <b>Baroque.</b> However, when a few years later the upper floor was added, despite the use of <b>Baroque</b> broken pediments above the windows, the neoclassical French influence is very pronounced, highlighted by the central curved bay. The Sicilian <b>Baroque</b> was gradually and slowly being superseded by French neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|He toured Europe and the Far East in 2007 {{with the}} European Brandenburg Ensemble, a <b>baroque</b> orchestra, formed to mark his 60th {{birthday}} by recording Bach's Brandenburg Concertos and performing popular <b>baroque</b> music. Its {{recording of the}} concertos won the Gramophone Award for <b>Baroque</b> Instrumental in 2008. The band was not a permanent orchestra, but planned to reconvene in 2011 when Bach's St John Passion {{was to be the}} focus of their work.|$|E
5|$|It was Dufourny's {{great friend}} and fellow {{architect}} Giuseppe Marvuglia who was to preside over the gradual decline of Sicilian <b>Baroque.</b> In 1784 he designed the Palazzo Riso-Belmonte, the finest example of this period of architectural transition, combining both <b>Baroque</b> and Palladian motifs, built around an arcaded courtyard providing <b>Baroque</b> masses of light and shade, or chiaroscuro. The main façade, punctuated by giant pilasters, also had <b>Baroque</b> features, but the skyline was unbroken. The pilasters were undecorated, simple, and Ionic, and supported an undecorated entablature. Above the windows were classical unbroken pediments. Sicilian <b>Baroque</b> was waning.|$|E
5|$|Later, a {{new wave}} of architects, who would master the <b>Baroque</b> sentiments, aware of Rococo {{interior}} styles beginning elsewhere to gain an ascendancy over <b>Baroque,</b> would go on to develop the flamboyance, freedom, and movement that are synonymous with the term Sicilian <b>Baroque</b> today.|$|E
5|$|Sicilian <b>Baroque</b> {{is today}} {{recognised}} as an architectural style, {{largely due to}} the work of Sacheverall Sitwell, whose Southern <b>Baroque</b> Art of 1924 was the first book to appreciate the style, followed by the more academic work of Anthony Blunt.|$|E
5|$|The Sicilian <b>Baroque</b> style came to {{fruition}} during a major surge of rebuilding following the massive earthquake in 1693. Previously, the <b>Baroque</b> style {{had been used}} on the island in a naïve and parochial manner, having evolved from hybrid native architecture rather than being derived from the great <b>Baroque</b> architects of Rome. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated <b>Baroque</b> architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; the work of these local architects — and the new genre of architectural engravings that they pioneered — inspired more local architects to follow their lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence {{in their use of}} the <b>Baroque</b> style. Their particular interpretation led to further evolution to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly fashionable neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|While each façade of Quattro Canti is {{pleasing}} to the eye, as a scheme {{it is both}} out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza and, like most other examples of early Sicilian <b>Baroque,</b> can be considered provincial, naive and heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, {{it is evident that}} during the 17th century, the <b>Baroque</b> style {{in the hands of the}} local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream <b>Baroque</b> was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin <b>Baroque</b> would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.|$|E
5|$|After {{the turn}} of the 19th century, {{architecture}} developed into the late <b>Baroque</b> style. Among the major proponents were Johan Conrad Ernst who built the Chancery Building or Kancellibygningen (1721) on Slotsholmen and Lauritz de Thurah who designed the Eremitage Palace (1734) in Dyrehaven, just north of Copenhagen. Even more ambitious was de Thurah's work at Ledreborg near Roskilde, where he succeeded in working the components into a well-balanced and cohesive <b>Baroque</b> palace.|$|E

5|$|Architectural {{contributions}} from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles, which were precursors of Romanesque. Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in Renaissance and <b>Baroque</b> art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. Weser Renaissance and Dresden <b>Baroque).</b> Among many renowned <b>Baroque</b> masters were Pöppelmann, Balthasar Neumann, Knobelsdorff and the Asam brothers. The Wessobrunner School exerted a decisive influence on, {{and at times}} even dominated, the art of stucco in southern Germany in the 18th century. The Upper Swabian <b>Baroque</b> Route offers a baroque-themed tourist route that highlights the contributions of such artists and craftsmen as the sculptor and plasterer Johann Michael Feuchtmayer, {{one of the foremost}} members of the Feuchtmayer family and the brothers Johann Baptist Zimmermann and Dominikus Zimmermann. Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing (Fachwerk) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.|$|E
5|$|Around 1730, the <b>Baroque</b> style {{gradually}} {{began to}} break away from the defined Roman style of <b>Baroque</b> and gain an even stronger individuality, for two reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding, construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of home-grown Sicilian architects came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the <b>Baroque,</b> and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the <b>Baroque</b> of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: churches upon the summits of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor Francesco de Sanctis's Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E
5|$|As Renaissance styles survived {{late in the}} city, the {{appearance}} of <b>Baroque</b> art was also delayed, but from the mid-18th century Klausenburg was once again at {{the centre of the}} development and spread of art in Transylvania, as it had been two centuries earlier. The first enthusiasts for <b>Baroque</b> were the Catholic Church and the landed aristocracy. Artists came initially from south Germany and Austria, {{but by the end of}} the century most of the work was by local craftsmen. The earliest signs of the new style appear in the furnishings of St. Michael's church: the altarpieces and pulpit, which date to the 1740s, are carved, painted and richly decorated with figures. An altarpiece depicting the Adoration of the Magi (1748–50) is the work of Franz Anton Maulbertsch. The earliest two-towered <b>Baroque</b> church was built by the Jesuits from 1718 to 1724 on the pattern of Košice and was later handed over to the Piarists. During the century more simply designed <b>Baroque</b> churches were built for the mendicant orders, Lutherans, Unitarians and the Orthodox Church. The noble families built houses and even palaces in the old town. The <b>Baroque</b> Bánffy Palace (1774–1785), constructed around a rectangular yard, is the masterpiece of Eberhardt Blaumann. Its peculiarity lies in {{the appearance}} of the principal façade.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the rest}} of Italy, the finest and most {{decorated}} rooms were those on the piano nobile, reserved for guests and entertaining. Entered formally from the external <b>Baroque</b> double staircase, these rooms consisted of a suite of large and small salons, with one very large salon being the principal room of the house, often used as a ballroom. Sometimes the guest bedrooms were sited here too, {{but by the end of}} the 18th century they were more often on a secondary floor above. If decorated during the <b>Baroque</b> era, the rooms would be profusely ornamented. Walls were frequently mirrored, the mirrors inset into gilded frames in the walls, often alternating with paintings similarly framed, while moulded nymphs and shepherdesses decorated the spaces between. Ceilings were high and frescoed, and from the ceiling hung huge coloured chandeliers of Murano glass, while further light came from gilded sconces flanking the mirrors adorning the walls. One of the most notable rooms in this style is the Gallery of Mirrors in Palermo's Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi (Illustration 17). This room with its frescoed ceiling by Gaspare Fumagalli is, however, one of the few <b>Baroque</b> rooms in this <b>Baroque</b> palazzo, which was (from 1750) extended and transformed by its owner Marianna Valguarnera, mostly in the later neoclassical style.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, most Russian churches from before the Petrine period had bulbous domes. The largest onion domes were erected in the seventeenth century in the area around Yaroslavl, {{incidentally}} famous for its large onions. Quite a few had more complicated bud-shaped domes, whose form derived from <b>Baroque</b> models of the late seventeenth century. Pear-shaped domes are usually associated with Ukrainian <b>Baroque,</b> while cone-shaped domes are typical for Orthodox churches of Transcaucasia.|$|E
5|$|Early <b>Baroque</b> organ {{music in}} Germany was highly contrapuntal. Sacred organ music {{was based on}} chorales: composers such as Samuel Scheidt and Heinrich Scheidemann wrote chorale preludes, chorale fantasias, and chorale motets. Towards {{the end of the}} <b>Baroque</b> era, the chorale prelude and the partita became mixed, forming the chorale partita. This genre was {{developed}} by Georg Böhm, Johann Pachelbel, and Dieterich Buxtehude. The primary type of free-form piece in this period was the praeludium, as exemplified in the works of Matthias Weckmann, Nicolaus Bruhns, Böhm, and Buxtehude. The organ music of Johann Sebastian Bach fused characteristics of every national tradition and historical style in his large-scale preludes and fugues and chorale-based works. Towards the end of the <b>Baroque</b> era, George Frideric Handel composed the first organ concertos.|$|E

5|$|In 1730, Vaccarini {{arrived in}} Catania as the {{appointed}} city architect and immediately impressed on the architecture the Roman <b>Baroque</b> style. The pilasters lose their rustication and support Roman type cornices and entablatures, or curved pediments, and free-standing columns support balconies. Vaccarini also exploited the local black lava stone as a decorative feature {{rather than a}} general building material, using it intermittently with other materials, and spectacularly for an obelisk supported {{on the back of}} the Catanian heraldic elephant, for a fountain in the style of Bernini in front of the new Town hall. Vaccarini's principal façade to Catania's cathedral, dedicated to Santa Agata, shows strong Spanish influences even at this late stage of Sicilian <b>Baroque.</b> Also in the city is Stefano Ittar's Church of the Collegiata, built around 1768. It is an example of Sicilian <b>Baroque</b> at its most stylistically simple.|$|E
5|$|In {{an alley}} {{connecting}} Ragusa Ibla with Ragusa Superiore {{is the church}} of Santa Maria delle Scale. This church is interesting, though badly damaged in the earthquake. Only half the church was rebuilt in <b>Baroque</b> style, while the surviving half was kept in the original Norman (with Gothic features), thus demonstrating in one piece the evolution of Sicilian <b>Baroque.</b>|$|E

5|$|Later {{many other}} Sicilian {{towns and cities}} which had been either little damaged or {{completely}} untouched by the quake, such as Palermo, were also transformed by the <b>Baroque</b> style, as the fashion spread and aristocrats with a palazzo in Catania came to wish their palazzo in the capital to be as opulent as that in the second city. In Palermo the , began in 1566, {{was one of many}} in the city to be redecorated inside in the 18th century in the <b>Baroque</b> style, with coloured marbles.|$|E
5|$|Mannerism is {{the name}} {{sometimes}} given to the period in art history during which the late Renaissance coexisted with the early <b>Baroque,</b> in Poland {{the last quarter of}} the 16th century and the first quarter of the 17th century. Polish art remained influenced by the Italian centers, increasingly Rome, and increasingly by the art of the Netherlands. As a fusion of imported and local elements, it evolved into an original Polish form of the <b>Baroque.</b>|$|E

5|$|Most of the <b>Baroque</b> palazzi {{continued}} in private ownership throughout the 19th century, {{as the old}} aristocracy either married middle-class money or fell further into debt.
