5|$|It was not, however, {{until the}} 1960s that Danish architects entered the world scene with their highly {{successful}} Functionalism. This, in turn, {{has evolved into}} more recent world-class masterpieces such as the Sydney Opera House and the Great Belt Bridge {{paving the way for}} a number of Danish designers to be rewarded for excellence <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since {{the turn}} of the millennium, Danish {{architecture}} has flourished <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad.</b> Two important areas of Greater Copenhagen have provided substantial opportunities for architectural developments on the domestic front while a number of firms have gained international recognition, winning important commissions abroad. For some, overseas assignments have become as important as those in Denmark itself.|$|E
5|$|The first unit {{to receive}} the A-10 Thunderbolt II was the 355th Tactical Training Wing, based at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, in March 1976. The first unit to achieve full combat-readiness was the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina, in 1978. Deployments of A-10As {{followed}} at bases <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad,</b> including England AFB, Louisiana; Eielson AFB, Alaska; Osan Air Base, South Korea; and RAF Bentwaters/RAF Woodbridge, England.

5|$|Tracy {{was absent}} from screens in 1946, {{the first year}} since his motion picture debut {{that there was no}} Spencer Tracy release. His next film was The Sea of Grass (1947) a drama set in the American Old West with Hepburn. Similarly to Keeper of the Flame and Without Love, a lukewarm {{response}} from critics did not stop it from being a financial success <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad.</b> He followed it later that year with Cass Timberlane, in which he played a judge. It was a commercial success, but Curtis notes that co-star Lana Turner overshadowed Tracy in most of the reviews.|$|E
5|$|Hepburn's {{next film}} was Undercurrent (1946), a film noir with Robert Taylor and Robert Mitchum that was poorly received. A fourth film with Tracy came in 1947: a drama {{set in the}} American Old West {{entitled}} The Sea of Grass. Similarly to Keeper of the Flame and Without Love, a lukewarm response from critics did not stop it from being a financial success <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad.</b> The same year, Hepburn portrayed Clara Wieck Schumann in Song of Love. She trained intensively with a pianist for the role. By {{the time of its}} release in October, Hepburn's career had been significantly affected by her public opposition to the growing anti-communist movement in Hollywood. Viewed by some as dangerously progressive, she was not offered work for nine months and people reportedly threw things at screenings of Song of Love. Her next film role came unexpectedly, as she agreed to replace Claudette Colbert only days before shooting began on Frank Capra's political drama State of the Union (1948). Tracy had long been signed to play the male lead, and so Hepburn was already familiar with the script and stepped up for the fifth Tracy–Hepburn picture. Critics responded positively to the film and it performed well at the box-office.|$|E
5|$|For {{his victory}} over L'Insurgente, Truxtun {{received}} honors <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad.</b> When {{accounts of the}} action reached London, Truxtun was fêted by the merchants there who sent him a piece of silver plate to commemorate his victory. In the United States, morale soared upon hearing of the first American victory over the French. Truxtun was cited by Stoddert for his excellent conduct during the action, and songs and poems such as Brave Yankee Boys were later written about the event. In contrast, when Barreaut returned to France {{he was accused of}} failing to put up sufficient resistance in the engagement and was given a court-martial. Despite the accusations, he had been praised by Truxtun after the action for his bravery and was acquitted during the court-martial. The French were infuriated upon hearing the results of the action because the two countries were not officially at war; Governor Edme Étienne Borne Desfourneaux of Guadeloupe demanded that Insurgent be returned to French control. Upon learning of the American refusal to repatriate Insurgent, Desfourneaux was outraged and ordered all American vessels and property to be seized, while also declaring that a state of war existed between the United States and Guadeloupe. After continuing their cruise for a few weeks, both Insurgent and Constellation were forced to return to Norfolk by the end of March due to the expiration of the terms of enlistment of their crews. On her next cruise Constellation prevailed in another action against La Vengeance, although her own casualties were heavy this time, and that French frigate escaped L'Insurgentes fate.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opening}} {{months of the}} Chamorro administration, social {{programs}} including free bus tokens for the education sector, pensions {{for the elderly and}} disabled, child care and child development services, and health care initiatives were cut. By 1991 the austerity measures adopted by Chamorro's administration were leading to massive strikes. Chamorro chose to recognize the workers' right to 25% of the shares of privatized state enterprises despite of the disapproval that generated <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad.</b> The Sandinistas, who had removed some of the businesses from the private sector during their administration were not in favor of privatization, but they were in favor of workers sharing in the revenues. The far-right of her own coalition was against making labor compromises of any kind. The US embassy and United States Agency for International Development both voiced displeasure at the concessions and speed with which the economic plan was being implemented. In spite of the other programs implemented, inflation was reduced by the renegotiation of the country's debt (called for by the Lacayo Plan). Through negotiations, Nicaragua was able to obtain a writedown of 75% of their international debt on the condition that they had no arrears. As noted previously, the US assisted Nicaragua in paying off the past-due debt to the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank through bridge loans and negotiating a 95% writedown of debts owed to Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. These measures provided the means to end hyperinflation and reopen monetary markets, but they were overshadowed by high unemployment, underemployment and an overall recession. The trade deficit rose and GNP declined, and overall, low wages, reductions of education and health services caused poverty to escalate, and social tensions to rise.|$|E
