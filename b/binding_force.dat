5|$|Since gluons carry color charge, they {{themselves}} are able to emit and absorb other gluons. This causes asymptotic freedom: as quarks come closer to each other, the chromodynamic <b>binding</b> <b>force</b> between them weakens. Conversely, as the distance between quarks increases, the <b>binding</b> <b>force</b> strengthens. The color field becomes stressed, much as an elastic band is stressed when stretched, and more gluons of appropriate color are spontaneously created to strengthen the field. Above a certain energy threshold, pairs of quarks and antiquarks are created. These pairs bind with the quarks being separated, causing new hadrons to form. This phenomenon is known as color confinement: quarks never appear in isolation. This process of hadronization occurs before quarks, formed in a high energy collision, are able to interact in any other way. The only exception is the top quark, which may decay before it hadronizes.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{the docking}} score, binding energy, and the {{quantity}} of important <b>binding</b> <b>forces,</b> we concluded that 5 -Hydroxy-L-tryptophan, merresectine C, and bufotenine had better binding capacity {{than that of the}} control. All of the top three candidates and the control formed H-bonds with Glu 203 and Lys 334. Aside from the H-bonds, all of the top three candidates formed pi bonds with His 202 and charge interactions with Glu 203. These inhibitors occupied the original space of the copper atoms. Therefore, Glu 203 and Lys 334 arethe key residues of the ligand-protein complex. 5 -hydroxy-L-tryptophan, merresectine C, and bufotenine had more stable binding energy and <b>binding</b> <b>forces</b> than that of the control.|$|R
25|$|Also {{because of}} the short range of the strong <b>binding</b> <b>force,</b> large stable nuclei must contain {{proportionally}} more neutrons than do the lightest elements, which are most stable with a 1to1 ratio of protons and neutrons. Nuclei which have more than 20protons cannot be stable unless they have more than {{an equal number of}} neutrons. Extra neutrons stabilize heavy elements because they add to strong-force binding (which acts between all nucleons) without adding to proton–proton repulsion. Fission products have, on average, about the same ratio of neutrons and protons as their parent nucleus, and are therefore usually unstable to beta decay (which changes neutrons to protons) because they have proportionally too many neutrons compared to stable isotopes of similar mass.|$|E
25|$|He often {{referred}} to Le Sage's theory in his lectures on physics at the University of Göttingen. However, around 1796 Lichtenberg changed his views after being persuaded by the arguments of Immanuel Kant, who criticized any kind of theory that attempted to replace attraction with impulsion. Kant {{pointed out that the}} very existence of spatially extended configurations of matter, such as particles of non-zero radius, implies the existence of some sort of <b>binding</b> <b>force</b> to hold the extended parts of the particle together. Now, that force cannot be explained by the push from the gravitational particles, because those particles too must hold together in the same way. To avoid this circular reasoning, Kant asserted that there must exist a fundamental attractive force. This was precisely the same objection that had always been raised against the impulse doctrine of Descartes in the previous century, and had led even the followers of Descartes to abandon that aspect of his philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Camel caravans, said to {{have first}} been used by Muhammad's great-grandfather, were {{a major part of}} Mecca's bustling economy. Alliances were struck between the merchants in Mecca and the local nomadic tribes, who would bring goods – leather, livestock, and metals mined in the local {{mountains}} – to Mecca to be loaded on the caravans and carried to cities in Syria and Iraq. Historical accounts also provide some indication that goods from other continents may also have flowed through Mecca. Goods from Africa and the Far East passed through en route to Syria including spices, leather, medicine, cloth, and slaves; in return Mecca received money, weapons, cereals and wine, which in turn were distributed throughout Arabia. The Meccans signed treaties with both the Byzantines and the Bedouins, and negotiated safe passages for caravans, giving them water and pasture rights. Mecca became the center of a loose confederation of client tribes, which included those of the Banu Tamim.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{emergence}} {{is defined in}} terms of entities. An entity is an aggregation that has properties that do not apply to its components and whose definition depends on the forces that bind the aggregation together. Four primary categories of entities are identified. Mass-based and attractor-based entities arise naturally and require no energy to persist. Designed entities are typically human-designed artifacts. Process/structure entities are typically social or biological systems that require the continual consumption of energy to perpetuate themselves. In all cases, entities expel entropy into their environment. Two other categories of entities, temporal and symbolic, are explored in less detail. Entities exist {{as a result of the}} <b>binding</b> <b>forces</b> that hold them together. The <b>binding</b> <b>forces</b> for mass- and attractor-based entities are fundamental forces and operate, in some sense, for free: emergence is built into nature. The <b>binding</b> <b>forces</b> for designed and structure/process entities require the application of energy and give rise to entities that have come to be known as being far from equilibrium. Entities are built on a substrate consisting of component entities and the forces to which those component entities are subject. This parallels the notion of levels of abstraction in computer science. The approach to emergence in this paper relates to the more traditional notions of nominal, weak, and strong emergence. We suggest a relationship between weak emergence and recursive enumerability. We discuss relationships between emergence and scientific reductionism and downward causation...|$|R

2500|$|The most {{elaborate}} and well-preserved Indian theory of atomism {{comes from the}} philosophy of the Jaina school, dating back to at least the 6th century BC. Some of the Jain texts that refer to matter and atoms are Pancastikayasara, Kalpasutra, Tattvarthasutra and Pannavana Suttam. The Jains envisioned the world as consisting wholly of atoms, except for souls. [...] Paramāņus or atoms were the basic building blocks of matter. Their concept of atoms was very similar to classical atomism, differing primarily in the specific properties of atoms. [...] Each atom, according to Jain philosophy, has one kind of taste, one smell, one color, and two kinds of touch, though it is unclear what was meant by [...] "kind of touch". [...] Atoms can exist in one of two states: subtle, in which case they can fit in infinitesimally small spaces, and gross, in which case they have extension and occupy a finite space. [...] Certain characteristics of Paramāņu correspond with that of sub-atomic particles. For example, Paramāņu is characterized by continuous motion either in a straight line or in case of attractions from other Paramāņus, it follows a curved path. This corresponds with the description of orbit of electrons across the Nucleus. Ultimate particles are also described as particles with positive (Snigdha i.e. smooth charge) and negative [...] (Rūksa – rough) charges that provide them the <b>binding</b> <b>force.</b> Although atoms are made of the same basic substance, they can combine based on their eternal properties to produce any of six [...] "aggregates", which seem to correspond with the Greek concept of [...] "elements": earth, water, shadow, sense objects, karmic matter, and unfit matter. [...] To the Jains, karma was real, but was a naturalistic, mechanistic phenomenon caused by buildups of subtle karmic matter within the soul. [...] They also had detailed theories of how atoms could combine, react, vibrate, move, and perform other actions, which were thoroughly deterministic.|$|E

For the customary morality, that which education and opinion have consecrated, is the only one which presents itself to the mind with the feeling of being in itself obligatory; and when a person is asked to believe that this morality derives its obligation from some general principle round which custom has not thrown the same halo, the assertion is to him a paradox; the supposed corollaries seem to have a more <b>binding</b> <b>force</b> than the original theorem; the superstructure seems to stand better without, than with, what is represented as its foundation.

Binding of the dye at the high affinity sites is accompanied by a change in intensity and a shift of the lactone carbonyl band in infrared and laser-Raman spectra as well as a decrease of the visible absorption at 580 nm suggesting a hydrophobic environment.
