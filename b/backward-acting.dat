40|$|In {{a variant}} of the {{negative}} priming (NP) procedure, the larger of two presented animals is to be named in each trial. Eight animals of different sizes are used, which allows a manipulation of conceptual task difficulty in terms of pair distance (difficult: one step, versus easy: three steps) on the series. Distances are varied for prime pairs and probe pairs orthogonally. NP effects were found for easy (wide) probe distances (Experiments 1 and 2) and, additionally, for easy (wide) prime distances (Experiment 2). This pattern is interpreted in terms of different theories of NP, which emphasize either forward-acting (prime to probe) or <b>backward-acting</b> (probe to prime) processes. The present results are most compatible with a <b>backward-acting</b> mechanism defined by the episodic retrieval perspective; they are less compatible with a forward-acting inhibition perspective. The results have implications for resource requirements of retrieval-based accounts of NP...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} forces {{encountered by}} aquatic animals affect their energetic requirements and therefore their body morphology and swimming patterns. Steller sea lions rely on swimming {{to travel and}} forage. To move through the dense and viscous water, they must overcome a <b>backward-acting</b> drag force that resists forward motion. Knowledge {{of the magnitude of}} drag provides information on the flow patterns in the boundary layer adjacent to the body surface; the characteristics of this flow will influence the total cost of swimming. Pinnipeds live in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, and their body design is affected by these dual requirements. The degree of drag reduction attributable to morphological adaptations may therefore be constrained by terrestrial demands. Drag determinations allow an animalâ€™s swimming performance, energetic requirements and body design to b...|$|E
