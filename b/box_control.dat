The piston valves were actuated by Walschaerts valve gear, driven from the coupled wheels furthest from the respective cylinders {{and controlled by}} steam reversing gear which was fitted under the boiler barrel between the cradle frame plates. The bissel trucks at the extremities of the locomotive were fitted with Cartazzi axle <b>box</b> <b>control</b> to allow the axles sideways play since the truck itself did not pivot, but was compensated with the adjacent pair of coupled wheels.|$|E

50|$|A new {{signalling}} installation {{has been}} commissioned at Alton. It is a colour-light system, {{running from the}} signal <b>box</b> <b>control</b> panel; this contrasts with the mechanical semaphore signals used {{on the rest of}} the line. The new system allows a more intensive train service, making use of the loop, and allows shunting within the station, operations which the previous manual flag signalling did not allow. The new installation makes use of track circuits to detect where the train is situated and can change points and signals accordingly. It can run fully automatically, so there is no need for a signalman, unlike the other signal boxes on the line. When there is no signalman, all Signal Post Telephones are diverted to Medstead & Four Marks signal box. It works on a system where a member of the locomotive crew inserts the token into a token switch, to allow the system to take the next steps.|$|E
40|$|Common energy {{management}} control systems (EMCS) in building HVAC systems {{could be made}} much more energy efficient without sacrificing comfort. Most researchers have focused on implementing optimal control algorithms in Variable Air Volume (VAV) systems with EMC functions. Previous studies have {{paid little attention to}} using terminal box EMC functions integrated with main AHU (Air Handling Unit) systems. Terminal boxes with EMCS may cause occupant discomfort and waste excessive energy if {{they do not have the}} proper operation control functions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of energy consumption and estimate building energy savings on the optimal minimum air flow of single duct VAV terminal boxes and develop applicable optimal terminal <b>box</b> <b>control</b> algorithms for EMCS. This paper presents a dynamic model of a VAV terminal box with hydronic reheat, develops optimal terminal <b>box</b> <b>control</b> algorithms and applies the developed EMCS algorithms to an actual building. The results of this study show that optimal terminal <b>box</b> <b>control</b> algorithms can stably maintain the set room air temperature and reduce energy consumption for varying heating loads compared to conventional control algorithms...|$|E

40|$|A {{constant}} minimum {{airflow rate}} {{is used in}} conventional Single Duct Variable Air Volume Terminal <b>Box</b> <b>control</b> sequences. This control sequence can cause occupant discomfort or use excessive energy under partial load conditions. If the minimum airflow rate is higher than required; terminal boxes will have significantly more simultaneous heating and cooling; and AHUs will consume more fan power. Buildings will have indoor air quality problems if the minimum airflow rate is less than required. Many engineers and researchers have investigated advanced variable air volume terminal <b>box</b> <b>control</b> algorithms without a system retrofit for thermal comfort; indoor air quality and energy savings. In this study a developed control system with variable minimum airflow rate for Single Duct Variable Air Volume Terminal Boxes was applied and validated using an actual building and evaluated for comfort; indoor air quality and energy consumption.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, an {{analytical}} subthreshold surface potential model is presented for a short-channel dual-metal-gate (DMG) recessed-source/drain (Re-S/D) silicon-on-insulator (SOI) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor (MOSFET). The {{model has been}} developed by solving the 2 D Poisson’s equations in the channel region with appropriate boundary conditions assuming a parabolic potential profile in the transverse direction of the channel. The developed model is analyzed extensively {{for a variety of}} device parameters like the oxide thickness, silicon and buried oxide (BOX) thicknesses, thickness of the source/drain extension in the <b>BOX,</b> <b>control</b> and screen gate length ratio and different combination of metal work function of control and screen gates.

40|$|PDE-constrained {{optimization}} aims {{at finding}} optimal setups for partial differential equations so that relevant quantities are minimized. Including sparsity promoting {{terms in the}} formulation of such problems results in more practically relevant computed controls but adds more challenges to the numerical solution of these problems. The needed L^ 1 -terms as well as additional inclusion of <b>box</b> <b>control</b> constraints require the use of semismooth Newton methods. We propose robust preconditioners for different formulations of the Newton's equation. With the inclusion of a line-search strategy and an inexact approach for the solution of the linear systems, the resulting semismooth Newton's method is feasible for practical problems. Our results are underpinned by a theoretical analysis of the preconditioned matrix. Numerical experiments illustrate the robustness of the proposed scheme...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} an overall {{review of the}} standard requirement, the terminal <b>box</b> <b>control,</b> occupancy sensing technology and DCV. There is system-specific guidance for single-zone systems, but DCV application guidance for multi-zone variable air volume (VAV) systems is not available. No real-world implementation case studies have been found using the CO 2 -based DCV. The review results also show that the constant minimum air flow set point causes excessive fan power consumption and potential simultaneous heating and cooling. Occupancy-based control (OBC) is needed for the terminal box {{in order to achieve}} deep energy savings. Key to OBC is a technology for sensing the actual occupancy of the zone served in real time.
