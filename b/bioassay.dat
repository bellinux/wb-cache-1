40|$|AbstractThe spatial {{distribution}} of eggs laid over a 48 -h period by individual female almond moths, Cadra cautella Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), was examined in <b>bioassays</b> where peanuts covered either the center quarter (quarter-coverage) or the whole (whole-coverage) of a 120 -cm square arena gridded into 3 by 3 -cm cells. The mean total of eggs laid in quarter-coverage <b>bioassays</b> was {{not significantly different from}} the mean in whole-coverage <b>bioassays,</b> i. e., neither food coverage limited oviposition. However, the maximum count of eggs laid in any cell was higher in whole- than in quarter-coverage <b>bioassays,</b> and eggs were more aggregated near edges of the arena in whole-coverage <b>bioassays</b> than near edges of the peanuts in quarter-coverage <b>bioassays.</b> In addition, eggs were aggregated near the release point where females initially encountered food cues. These results suggest that almond moth oviposition behavior in continuous areas of peanuts was similar to patterns observed previously for stored-product insect oviposition in small, scattered food patches. In both cases, females walked or flew between separate oviposition events where eggs were laid in small clumps or lines. Possible behaviors resulting in aggregations of eggs near edges of food, walls, boundaries, or entrances are discussed and implications for precision targeting of insects in food storage areas are considered...|$|R

By 1971, Vane identified the chemical (which they called [...] "rabbit-aorta contracting substance," [...] or RCS) as a prostaglandin. In a 23 June 1971 paper in the journal Nature, Vane and Piper suggested that aspirin and similar drugs (the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs) worked by blocking the production of prostaglandins.

2500|$|This legend {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} ones in the history of drug testing, and is only partly true. [...] Consumption of vinegar will lower the pH (i.e. {{increasing}} the acidity) of the blood and urine, and drugs that contain amine groups (such as amphetamines) will be cleared out somewhat faster as their water solubility increases due to protonation. Also, the reduced pH can potentially throw off the pH-sensitive enzymes in a particular type of <b>bioassay</b> (EMIT) often (but not always) used as the initial screening test, even for non-amine-containing drugs such as THC. However, vinegar is not necessary to do so, as there are other things (such as high doses of vitamin C) that can do the same thing, but without the almost inevitable diarrhea and vomiting that vinegar can produce after consuming large quantities. Saliva testing can be deterred with the use of vinegar—not to say drinking it, but merely washing out the mouth will throw off most saliva kits.|$|E

The quantity of heavy water involved was far below levels that could induce heavy water toxicity, but several employees received elevated radiation doses from tritium and neutron-activated chemicals in the water.

40|$|Thousands {{of organic}} micropollutants and their {{transformation}} products occur in water. Although often present at low concentrations, individual compounds contribute to mixture effects. Cell-based <b>bioassays</b> that target health-relevant biological endpoints may therefore complement chemical analysis for water quality assessment. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate cell-based <b>bioassays</b> for their suitability to benchmark water quality and to assess efficacy of water treatment processes. The selected <b>bioassays</b> cover relevant steps in the toxicity pathways including induction of xenobiotic metabolism, specific and reactive modes of toxic action, activation of adaptive stress response pathways and system responses. Twenty laboratories applied 103 unique in vitro <b>bioassays</b> to a common set of 10 water samples collected in Australia, including wastewater treatment plant effluent, two types of recycled water (reverse osmosis and ozonation/activated carbon filtration), stormwater, surface water, and drinking water. Sixtyfive <b>bioassays</b> (63 %) showed positive results in at least one sample, typically in wastewater treatment plant effluent, and only five (5 %) were positive in the control (ultrapure water). Each water type had a characteristic bioanalytical profile with particular groups of toxicity pathways either consistently responsive or not responsive across test systems. The most responsive healthrelevant endpoints were related to xenobiotic metabolism (pregnane X and aryl hydrocarbon receptors), hormone-mediated modes of action (mainly related to the estrogen, glucocorticoid, and antiandrogen activities), reactive modes of action (genotoxicity) and adaptive stress response pathway (oxidative stress response).
