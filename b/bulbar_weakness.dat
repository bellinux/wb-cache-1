40|$|Myasthenia gravis with {{antibodies}} to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK-MG) {{is generally considered}} a severe disease because of the associated weakness distribution with prevalent involvement of bulbar muscles and a rapidly progressive course and early respiratory crises. Its treatment can be unrewarding, owing to poor response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in most patients, disease relapses in spite of high-dose immunosuppression, and development of permanent <b>bulbar</b> <b>weakness.</b> High-dose prednisone plus plasma exchange is the recommended approach for treating rapidly progressive <b>bulbar</b> <b>weakness.</b> In the disease management, oral steroids proved effective, plasma exchange produced marked, albeit short-term, improvement, while conventional immunosuppressants were comparatively less effective. Rituximab is a promising treatment for refractory MuSK-MG; in uncontrolled studies, nearly all treated patients achieved significant improvement with substantial decrease of medication. It {{is yet to be}} clarified whether the early use of rituximab could prevent the permanent <b>bulbar</b> <b>weakness,</b> which constitutes a relevant disability in these patients...|$|E

The aim {{of the study is}} to use the New Combined Scoring System in anticipating respiratory failure in order to perform elective measures without waiting for emergency situations to occur. Patients and methods: Fifty patients with GBS were studied. Eight clinical parameters (including progression of patients to maximum weakness, respiratory rate/minute, breath holdingcount (the number of digits the patient can count in holding his breath), presence of facial muscle weakness (unilateral or bilateral), presence of <b>weakness</b> of the <b>bulbar</b> muscle, <b>weakness</b> of the neck flexor muscle, and limbs weakness) were assessed for each patient and a certain score was given toeach parameter, a designed combined score being constructed by taking into consideration all the above mentioned clinical parameters. Results and discussion: Fifteen patients (30 %) that were enrolled in our study developed respiratory failure. There was a highly significant statistical association between the development of respiratory failure and the lower grades of (<b>bulbar</b> muscle <b>weakness</b> score, breath holding count scores, neck muscle weakness score, lower limbs and upper limbs weakness score, respiratory rate score) and the total sum score above 16 out of 30 (p-value= 0. 000).

40|$|In {{neuromuscular disease}} (NMD), {{respiratory}} muscle weakness (RMW) is common and death often results from respiratory failure.

In addition to assessing the pattern and severity of muscle involvement, {{it is important to}} consider whether the underlying disorder is reversible (eg Guillain–Barré syndrome [GBS]), stable or only slowly progressive (eg post-polio syndrome or myotonic dystrophy) or rapidly progressive (eg amyotrophi...|$|R
40|$|Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a well-recognised {{disorder}} of neuromuscular transmission {{that can be}} diagnosed {{by the presence of}} antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). However, some patients (about 15 %) with generalised MG do not have detectable AChR antibodies. There is some evidence, however, that this "seronegative" MG is an antibody-mediated disorder. Plasma from patients with the disorder seems to contain various distinct humoral factors: IgG antibodies that reversibly inhibit AChR function; a non-IgG (possibly IgM) factor that indirectly inhibits AChR function; and an IgG antibody against the muscle-specific kinase (MuSK). The presence of antibodies against MuSK appears to define a subgroup of patients with seronegative MG who have predominantly localised, in many cases <b>bulbar,</b> muscle <b>weaknesses</b> (face, tongue, pharynx, etc) and reduced response to conventional immunosuppressive treatments. Moreover, muscle wasting may be present, which prevents complete response to these therapies...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Congenital myasthenic syndromes are rare. Mutations in MUSK {{were first}} {{described}} in 2004. Thirteen patients {{have been reported}} to date, mostly with a relatively mild course. The molecular diagnosis has implications for choice of treatment and genetic counseling. METHODS: Clinical course and electrophysiological, pathological, and genetic findings were assessed. RESULTS: We describe the case of a boy with prenatal onset and severe respiratory symptoms with a persisting need for ventilation. The patient had severe bulbar symptoms, marked axial weakness causing a "dropped head," and some facial and proximal weakness. Ophthalmoparesis developed {{during the first year of}} life. Salbutamol led to improvement, 3, 4 -diaminopyridine had a modest effect, but pyridostigmine produced deterioration. Two novel mutations in MUSK were found by whole exome sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: We expand the phenotype of congenital myasthenic syndromes with MUSK mutations, describing a more severe clinical course with prenatal onset. Predominant <b>bulbar</b> and respiratory <b>weakness</b> with facial and axial weakness and ophthalmoparesis are diagnostic clues...|$|R
40|$|Background. Management of the myasthenic crisis {{remains one}} of the issues in {{clinical}} neurology. Objective. Analysis of the timeframes of the myasthenic exacerbation since the disease onset, sex distribution, age predominance, specific clinical features, precipitating factors in order to investigate the efficacy of the management algorithm of the myasthenic crisis. Materials and methods. Medical histories of 33 female and 19 male patients with myasthenia for the period of 2000 to 2003 were analyzed. Results. In comparison with the literature data the number of mysthenic crisis in myasthenic patients was lower and did not exceed 25 %.  Sex distribution 1, 2 (male) : 1 (female). In 70 % worsening of myasthenia appeared {{in the first two years}} of the disease: in 6 patients (46. 2 %)  at the age of 22 – 35 y. o.; in 5 patients (38. 5 %) – at the age of 36 – 60 y. o. All patients suffered from generalized myasthenia, in three of them ocular and <b>bulbar</b> muscle <b>weakness</b> predominated. In 46. 2 % of patients with crisis, thymus abnormalities were present (thymoma / hyperplasia).  The most common precipitating factors were: infection (36. 9 %), stress (26. 3 %), misuse of the anticholinesterase drugs (15. 8 %).  In 5. 2 % the worsening of myasthenia followed the delivery. The crisis triggering factor was not identified in 15. 8 % of cases. Conclusion. In order to prevent the exacerbation of myasthenia, generalized forms of myasthenia with poor response to anticholinesterase drugs require special attention towards patients in their first two years of the disease, including patient’s educational program on appropriate mode of drug administration and avoiding initiating factors, as well as thymectomy. </p...|$|R

40|$|Acute disseminated {{encephalomyelitis}} (ADEM) {{seems to}} be an immune-mediated demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). Corticosteroid administration is a commonly used treatment for ADEM. Recently, several reports on the successful use of plasmapheresis (PP) in ADEM were presented. We described the efficacy of PP as the immunoadsorption therapy (IAT) for two patients with severe ADEM who did not respond to corticosteroids. One patient developed stupor, bilateral facial <b>weakness,</b> <b>bulbar</b> palsy and tetraplegia, and the other patient developed delirium, muscle weakness of the arms and legs, and external ophthalmoplegia from the administration of corticosteroid. After IAT, both patients recovered remarkably well. Laboratory studies revealed a elevation of the IgG index, an increase in suppressor-inducer T cells and activated T cells, and that anti-GQ 1 b antibody was positive in the peripheral blood. These abnormalities improved after IAT. The mechanism of efficacy of IAT is unknown, but IAT might correct the immune function by modulating cytokines and removing the toxic substances, which lead to the autoimmune response in the CNS.

40|$|Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease associated with a positive familial history in 5 - 10 % of ALS cases.

Molecular analysis showed a heterozygous mutation at codon 106 resulting in a substitution of phenylalanine for leucine in the SOD 1 protein (L 106 F). In analogy with the previously reported L 106 V mutation, we propose that the L 106 F causes a relevant destabilization of the protein chain around the mutation site, able to affect the SOD 1 monomer and dimer structures suggesting a pathogenic role for this novel mutation...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the clinical features and {{risk factors for}} myasthenia gravis crisis (MGC) after impact therapy of glucocorticoid.   Methods Clinical data of 59 MG patients were retrospectively analyzed. All of them received high-dose glucocorticoid treatment, and 16 patients developed into MGC. Clinical Absolute Score (CAS) was obtained on admission, then at 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 d after treatment initiation, so as to evaluate the severity of disease. Clinical Relative Score (CRS) {{was used to evaluate}} the changes of patients' condition. The clinical features, scores and risk factors in MGC group were compared with non-MGC (NMGC) group. Results Most patients (69. 49 %, 41 / 59) had transient muscle weakness after glucocorticoid impact therapy. CAS of MGC group increased at 4 d (37. 63 ± 1. 80; t = 4. 410, P = 0. 028), then decreased at 7 d (32. 94 ± 2. 29), until 14 d after therapy (22. 19 ± 1. 75), which was significantly lower than that before treatment (31. 31 ± 2. 07; t = 12. 701, P = 0. 000). CAS of NMGC group showed a downward trend after treatment. It showed a significant decrease at 14 d after therapy (12. 37 ± 1. 11) compared with that before treatment (21. 27 ± 1. 39; t = 5. 740, P = 0. 000), which was consistent with its clinical manifestations. In MGC group, CRS increased gradually from 7 d [(- 0. 06 ± 0. 06) %] after treatment till 28 d [(0. 82 ± 0. 03) %], which was significantly different from 4 d [(- 0. 23 ± 0. 05) %; t = 28. 232, P = 0. 000). Similarly, CRS of NMGC group increased gradually and showed significant difference till 21 d [(0. 53 ± 0. 04) %] when compared with 4 d [(0. 03 ± 0. 04) %; t = 4. 312, P = 0. 000]. Logistic regression analysis showed relative old age, increasing CAS, infection, <b>bulbar</b> muscular <b>weakness</b> and comorbid immunological disorders were crisis-prone factors, but old age was the only factor closely related to the occurrence of MGC.   Conclusions Relative old age maybe the risk factor for MGC after impact therapy of glucocorticoid. Monitoring the disease change closely, screening out high-risk patients timely, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and respiratory support are all very important for successful treatment and low mortality.   doi: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2014. 10. 011 </p...|$|R

40|$|Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare, {{autoimmune}} {{neuromuscular junction}} disorder. Contemporary prevalence rates approach 1 / 5, 000. MG presents with painless, fluctuating, fatigable weakness involving specific muscle groups. Ocular weakness with asymmetric ptosis and binocular diplopia {{is the most}} typical initial presentation, while early or isolated oropharyngeal or limb weakness is less common. The course is variable, and most patients with initial ocular <b>weakness</b> develop <b>bulbar</b> or limb <b>weakness</b> within three years of initial symptom onset. MG results from antibody-mediated, T cell-dependent immunologic attack on the endplate region of the postsynaptic membrane. In patients with fatigable muscle weakness, the diagnosis of MG is supported by: 1. pharmacologic testing with edrophonium chloride that elicits unequivocal improvement in strength; 2. electrophysiologic testing with repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) studies and/or single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) that demonstrates a primary postsynaptic neuromuscular junctional disorder; and 3. serologic demonstration of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies. Differential diagnosis includes congenital myasthenic syndromes, Lambert Eaton syndrome, botulism, organophosphate intoxication, mitochondrial disorders involving progressive external ophthalmoplegia, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), motor neuron disease, and brainstem ischemia. Treatment must be individualized, and may include symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors and immune modulation with corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil. Rapid, temporary improvement may be achieved for myasthenic crises and exacerbations with plasma exchange (PEX) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Owing to improved diagnostic testing, immunotherapy, and intensive care, the contemporary prognosis is favorable with less than five percent mortality and nearly normal life expectancy...|$|R
40|$|Aims This {{paper is}} a {{qualitative}} investigation {{that aims to}} investigate the lived experience of fatigue in patients with motor neurone disease – a progressive and fatal neurological condition. Background Fatigue is a disabling symptom in motor neurone disease (MND) that affects {{a large number of}} patients. However, the term ‘fatigue’ is in itself imprecise, as it remains a phenomenon without a widely accepted medical definition. This study sought to investigate the phenomenon of fatigue {{from the perspective of the}} MND patient. Methods Ten patients with MND participated in semi-structured recorded interviews at a regional neuroscience centre in Liverpool, U. K. Transcripts analysis was broadly informed by the principles of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Findings Fatigue was unanimously explained to be disabling and progressive phenomenon. Participants described two forms of fatigue: whole-body tiredness, or use-dependent reversible muscle weakness related to exertion of limb and <b>bulbar</b> muscles. Both <b>weakness</b> and whole-body tiredness could be experienced simultaneously, and patients used the terms ‘fatigue’ and ‘tiredness’ interchangeably. Alongside descriptions of fatigue themes of Adaptation, Motivation, Avoidance, Frustration and Stress were revealed. Fatigue could be defined as reversible motor weakness and whole-body tiredness that was predominantly brought on by muscular exertion and was partially relieved by rest. Conclusion The results of this study support a multi-dimensional model of fatigue for patients with MND. Fatigue appears to be experienced and explained in two ways, both as an inability to sustain motor function and as a pervasive tiredness. Fatigue was only partially relieved by rest and tended to worsen throughout the day. It is crucial that MND care practitioners and researchers appreciate the semantic dichotomy within fatigue...|$|R

Principal Findings: There were 33 patients enrolled (median age 35 y; 24 males). Eight did not develop neurotoxicity and had normal sfEMG. Eight had mild neurotoxicity with ptosis, normal sfEMG; six received antivenom and all recovered within 20 - 32 h. Seventeen patients developed severe neurotoxicity with rapidly descending paralysis, from ptosis to complete ophthalmoplegia, facial, <b>bulbar</b> and neck <b>weakness.</b> All 17 received Indian polyvalent antivenom a median 3. 5 h post-bite (2. 8 - 7. 2 h), which cleared unbound venom from blood. Despite this, the paralysis worsened requiring intubation and ventilation within 7 h post-bite. sfEMG showed markedly increased jitter and neuromuscular blocks within 12 h. sfEMG abnormalities gradually improved over 24 h, corresponding with clinical recovery. Muscle recovery occurred in ascending order. Myotoxicity was not evident, clinically or biochemically, {{in any of the}} patients. Patients were extubated a median 96 h post-bite (54 - 216 h).

MG with MuSK antibodies (MuSK-MG) {{is often associated with}} persistent bulbar involvement, including marked facial weakness and tongue muscle wasting. The extent of muscle wasting in MuSK-MG, and whether it is also found in the few acetylcholine receptor (AChR-MG) patients who have persistent bulbar involvement, is not clear. We studied 12 MuSK-MG patients and recruited 14 AChR-MG patients matched broadly for age, sex ratio, duration of disease and degree of ocular, <b>bulbar</b> and facial <b>weakness.</b> We used coronal and sagittal T 1 -weighted (T 1 W) and T 2 -weighted (T 2 W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess muscle wasting in facial and tongue muscles. Hyperintense signal on T 1 W MRI and comparison of axial T 1 W sequences with cUTE sequences were used to assess fibrous/fatty tissue in the tongue. We compared the results with those of four patients with myotonic dystrophy and 12 healthy individuals. We correlated the changes with clinical and treatment histories, and established a new ocular-bulbar-facial-respiratory (OBFR) score. At the time of study, none of the clinical measures, including the OBFR score, differed between the two MG groups. MRI demonstrated thinning of the buccinator, orbicularis oris (O. oris) and orbicularis oculi (O. oculi) muscles in MuSK-MG patients compared with healthy controls, whereas thinning of these muscles was not significant in AChR-MG. Tongue areas with T 1 W high signal were increased in MuSK-MG patients and the intensity of the signal on axial T 1 W sequences was greater in MuSK-MG than in controls. To look for possible correlations between imaging and clinical findings, we pooled results from all MG patients. The duration of treatment with prednisolone at > 40 mg on alternate days (AD) correlated positively with the percentage of tongue area with high signal (P = 0. 006) and negatively with MRI measurements of individual muscles and with the mean muscle dimensions (P = 0. 001). The new OBFR score correlated positively with current Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America grades and with the percentage of high signal (P = 0. 004) and negatively with the mean muscle dimensions (P 40 mg AD), may be an additional factor...|$|R
40|$|Objective We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} neurophysiological and clinical effects of common krait envenoming, including the time course and treatment response. Methodology Patients with definite common krait (Bungarus caeruleus) bites {{were recruited from}} a Sri Lankan hospital. All patients had serial neurological examinations and stimulated concentric needle single-fibre electromyography (sfEMG) of orbicularis oculi in hospital at 6 wk and 6 – 9 mth post-bite. Principal Findings There were 33 patients enrolled (median age 35 y; 24 males). Eight did not develop neurotoxicity and had normal sfEMG. Eight had mild neurotoxicity with ptosis, normal sfEMG; six received antivenom and all recovered within 20 – 32 h. Seventeen patients developed severe neurotoxicity with rapidly descending paralysis, from ptosis to complete ophthalmoplegia, facial, <b>bulbar</b> and neck <b>weakness.</b> All 17 received Indian polyvalent antivenom a median 3. 5 h post-bite (2. 8 – 7. 2 h), which cleared unbound venom from blood. Despite this, the paralysis worsened requiring intubation and ventilation within 7 h post-bite. sfEMG showed markedly increased jitter and neuromuscular blocks within 12 h. sfEMG abnormalities gradually improved over 24 h, corresponding with clinical recovery. Muscle recovery occurred in ascending order. Myotoxicity was not evident, clinically or biochemically, {{in any of the}} patients. Patients were extubated a median 96 h post-bite (54 – 216 h). On discharge, median 8 days (4 – 12 days) post-bite, patients were clinically normal but had mild sfEMG abnormalities which persisted at 6 wk post-bite. There were no clinical or neurophysiological abnormalities at 6 – 9 mth. Conclusions Common krait envenoming causes rapid onset severe neuromuscular paralysis which takes days to recover clinically consistent with sfEMG. Subclinical neuromuscular dysfunction lasts weeks but was not permanent. Antivenom effectively cleared venom but did not prevent worsening or reverse neuromuscular paralysis.
