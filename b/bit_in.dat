With no screws, the headstall broke loose from the bridle after she made the turn around the first barrel. When she strove for the second barrel, the bridle was hanging from the horse's mouth to down under his foot. Meanwhile, she is trying to hold that <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> his mouth. But coming to the third barrel, she has to turn his head loose.|$|E
5|$|The Eighteenth Dynasty tombs {{within the}} valley vary quite a <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> decoration, style, and location. It seems {{that at first}} there was no fixed plan. The tomb of Hatshepsut has a unique shape, {{twisting}} and turning down over 200metres from the entrance, so that the burial chamber is 97metres below the surface. The tombs gradually became more regular and formalised, and those of Thutmose III and Thutmose IV, KV34 and KV43, are good examples of Eighteenth Dynasty tombs, both with their bent axis, and simple decoration.|$|E

25|$|An {{inherent}} advantage yielded by {{quantum cryptography}} {{when compared to}} classical cryptography is the detection of passive eavesdropping.

Because the intended recipient was expecting to receive the <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> a superposition state, the intended recipient would know there was an attack, because the bit's state would no longer be in a superposition.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{twist drill}} bits tend to wander when {{presented}} to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a pilot hole with a spotting drill <b>bit.</b> <b>In</b> wood, the lip and spur drill bit is another solution: The {{centre of the}} drill bit is given not the straight chisel of the twist drill bit, but a spur with a sharp point and four sharp corners to cut the wood. The sharp point of the spur simply pushes into the soft wood to keep the drill <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> line.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Object-oriented {{frameworks}} {{have extended}} reusability of software from code modules to architectural and domain information. This paper further extends software reusability from code and architecture to built-in tests (<b>BITs)</b> <b>in</b> object-oriented framework development. Methods for embedding BITs at object and object-oriented framework levels are addressed. Behaviours {{of objects and}} object-oriented frameworks with <b>BITs</b> <b>in</b> the normal and test modes are analyzed. Systematic reuse methods of <b>BITs</b> <b>in</b> object-oriented framework development are provided. The most interesting development in the paper is that the <b>BITs</b> <b>in</b> object-oriented frameworks can be inherited and reused as that of code. Therefore testability and maintainability of the test-built-in object-oriented frameworks can be improved by the BIT approach. The BIT method {{can be used in}} analysis, design and coding of object-oriented frameworks...|$|R

25|$|The uniform {{crossover}} evaluates each <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> {{the parent}} strings for exchange with a probability of 0.5. Empirical evidence {{suggest that it}} is a more exploratory approach to crossover than the traditional exploitative approach that maintains longer schemata. This results in a more complete search of the design space with maintaining the exchange of good information. Unfortunately, no satisfactory theory exists to explain the discrepancies between the uniform crossover and the traditional approaches.|$|E

Accuracy is not as {{important}} {{in the creation of}} these mortises as the biscuit joint is designed to allow a bit of flexibility during glue up. The mortise must be located at the correct distance {{from the face of the}} joint in both members but the width of the mortise is not as critical.|$|E
25|$|Compared to NOR flash, {{replacing}} single transistors with serial-linked groups adds {{an extra}} level of addressing. Whereas NORflash might address memory by page then word, NANDflash might address it by page, word and bit. Bit-level addressing suits bit-serial applications (such as hard disk emulation), which access only one bit at a time. Execute-in-place applications, {{on the other}} hand, require every <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> a word to be accessed simultaneously. This requires word-level addressing.
