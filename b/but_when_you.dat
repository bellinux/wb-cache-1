In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my music. I was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|E

Commenting on his writing for trio and quartet, Taborn stated that [...] "I like multiple kinds of rhythmic things.

500|$|Weiner {{was fascinated}} by the presences of the Richard Speck murders in the media, despite the 40 race riots {{occurring}} in America around the same time. [...] "Part of that force is the sex drive. No one wants to be a victim of that, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> look at Pauline's interest in the murders, it's sexual. It's such a deep touchstone of creepiness," [...] he noted.|$|E
500|$|Legia Warsaw goalkeeper Łukasz Fabiański was {{the first}} player Arsenal {{recruited}} of the new season. Next to arrive was striker Eduardo, who signed from Dinamo Zagreb, shortly followed by French defender Bacary Sagna. Lassana Diarra was purchased on transfer deadline day from Chelsea, but later transferred to Portsmouth in January after he was frustrated at limited playing time; he said, [...] "I read that the club [...] wanted to keep me. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> want to keep someone, you do it by playing them. This hasn't been the case." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} set in the DC Universe but is non-canon, similar to an Elseworlds story. The content is divided into 60chapters which mostly {{alternate}} between the (third person) points-of-view of the two protagonists, Batman/Bruce Wayne and Superman/Clark Kent, though several chapters follow antagonists (Lex Luthor and Soviet General Anatoly Ceridov). While the novel is based on comic book characters, it consists solely of prose. Anderson commented on the difficulty in writing comics as prose stating, [...] "in the comics, several pages of superpowered action can propel the story, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> read it in a book, it's not quite so interesting. You need more parts to the story..." ...|$|E

500|$|Fincher {{decided to}} use the digital Thomson Viper Filmstream camera to shoot the film. Fincher had {{previously}} used the Thomson Viper {{over the past three years}} on commercials for Nike, Hewlett Packard, Heineken and Lexus which allowed him to get used to and experiment with the equipment. He was able to use inexpensive desktop software like Final Cut Pro to edit Zodiac. Fincher remarked in an interview, [...] "Dailies almost always end up being disappointing, like the veil is pierced and you look at it for the first time and think, 'Oh my god, this is what I really have to work with.' <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> can see what you have as it's gathered, it can be a much less neurotic process." ...|$|E
500|$|Clocking in at {{over two}} hours in length and {{containing}} 34 tracks, The Astonishing was planned as an immersive experience that would be best enjoyed as a full album {{as opposed to a}} collection of singles. The album plays out similarly to a film, with Loudwire observing, [...] "It’s an enormous amount of music to absorb in one sitting, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> think about it, most movies are around {{two hours in}} length, and The Astonishing is very much like a movie in the way it delivers the storyline." [...] Certain songs, such as [...] "A Savior in the Square" [...] and [...] "Our New World", have reoccurring themes, while others stand more on their own in order to move the plot along.|$|E
500|$|Weiner {{said that}} the episode is [...] "about the {{children}}. It's about {{who is going to}} take care of the children. Youth is a big part of our lives in general. Now and then. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> think of the sixties and the youth culture and the way it sort of takes over. What you're looking at is Don's fear of the children being cut loose. At the same time, the children come back and eat you." [...] Weiner commented that the Michael Ginsberg character was [...] "of the next wave" [...] as a youthful employee who is [...] "unfamiliar with social rules", with Weiner also declaring that [...] "there is no reason that the concerns of older people are different than younger people".|$|E

500|$|Campbell {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of}} the best power running backs in NFL history, and was highly regarded by his peers. [...] "Every time you hit him you lower your own IQ," [...] said Redskins linebacker Pete Wysocki. Cornerback Lester Hayes of the Raiders said [...] "Earl Campbell was put on this earth to play football." [...] Cliff Harris, safety for the Cowboys, recalled Campbell as [...] "the hardest-hitting running back I ever played against. He didn't have the elusiveness of an O. J. Simpson. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> finished a game against Earl, you had to sit in a tub with Epsom salts." [...] Bum Phillips, when asked if Campbell was in a class by himself, quipped, [...] "I dunno. But if he ain't, it don't take long to call the roll." ...|$|E
500|$|Championship runner-up Fernando Alonso {{expressed}} {{pride for}} his team, {{going so far}} as to call the 2012 season [...] "the best season of my career". During the podium interview with Nelson Piquet, he asserted: [...] "Obviously we lost the championship now, but I don't think, as you said, that we lost here in Brazil, we lost in some races where we were a little bit unlucky. But this is a sport, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do something with your heart, when you do something with 100 per cent, you have to be proud of your team, happy for them, and we will try next year." [...] The press later pointed out Alonso's [...] "grace after the race", contrasting him to Vettel who had criticized the competition's [...] "dirty tricks" [...] during his post-race press conference.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{decided not}} to {{replicate}} the X-Men costumes {{as seen in the}} comic book. Stan Lee and Chris Claremont supported this decision. Claremont joked, [...] "you can do that on a drawing, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> put it on people it's disturbing!" [...] Producer/co-writer Tom DeSanto had been supportive of using the blue and yellow color scheme of the comics, but came to conclude that they would not work onscreen. To acknowledge the fan complaints, Singer added Cyclops' line [...] "What would you prefer, yellow spandex?" [...] – when Wolverine complains about wearing their uniforms – during filming. Singer noted that durable black leather made more sense for the X-Men to wear as protective clothing, and Shuler Donner added that the costumes helped them [...] "blend into the night".|$|E

500|$|In July 2012, Pusha T told MTV {{that while}} he was putting {{together}} his solo album, he was heavily influenced by Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino's 1997 film The Devil's Advocate. [...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that. If you just look at it at face value, you might think, 'It sounds a bit like he's glorifying ', <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get tuned into the record, you realize that you get both sides of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Armitage {{performs}} his own stunts. When performing fight scenes, {{they would}} be choreographed carefully so Armitage could take part rather than a stunt double. For series eight, Armitage performed a fight scene in a swimming pool, which he thought was [...] "fun," [...] but also thought it was difficult as it was [...] "like acting and punching in slow motion." [...] In another sequence, he injured a stuntman with a hospital trolley. He was only given a short lesson {{on how to handle}} firearms, since he was already accustomed to using them whilst working on Ultimate Force. While discussing the shootout at the end of series seven, Armitage noted that he is [...] "not a violent person <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> put a gun in somebody's hands [...] it's like a little animal comes out of you that wants to fire the gun again." ...|$|E
500|$|At Wimbledon, Raonic {{was again}} seeded eighth. He {{defeated}} Matthew Ebden, Jack Sock, Łukasz Kubot, Nishikori, and Kyrgios {{to reach his}} first major semifinal. He became the first Canadian men's singles player to reach the semifinals at a major since Robert Powell in 1908. [...] In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: [...] "There's {{a lot of good}} things to take from it. ... <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get here to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more. [...] You feel it in front of you and you want to grab it." [...] Despite the loss, Raonic saw his world ranking improve to a career-high No. 6.|$|E
