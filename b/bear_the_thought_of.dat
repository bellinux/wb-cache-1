25|$|Chapman {{took over}} the editorship of the New Zealand Law Reports after Fitzgerald's death. Chapman was a Wellington City Councillor (1888–1890) {{and a member of}} the council of the Wellington Law Society. He had an {{aptitude}} for languages and as a young man, he became proficient in French and German. He later learned Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, and Dutch when he was at old age. He once gave as his reason for taking up Spanish because he planned to go on a trip to that country, and could not <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> not being able to read the local newspapers.|$|E
25|$|Rudra Singha (reign 1696 to 1714) was {{a devout}} Hindu {{and as he}} grew older he decided to {{formally}} embrace the religion and become an orthodox Hindu by being initiated or taking sharan of a Guru, who would teach him the mantras and become his spiritual guide. But, he could not <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> humbling {{himself in front of}} a Brahmin who is his subject. He therefore sent envoys to Bengal and summoned Krishnaram Bhattacharyya, a famous mahant of Shakta sect who lived in Malipota, near Santipur in Nadia district. The mahant was unwilling to come, but consented on being promised to be given the care of the Kamakhya temple to him. Though the king did not take sharan(shelter), he satisfied the mahant by ordering his sons and the Brahmins in his entourage to accept him as their spiritual guru.|$|E
25|$|Seven more {{errors in}} nine more chances {{followed}} that day, a debacle that McGraw would not soon forget. After the team opened with no wins in six contests, Kenney {{and the other}} members of the ownership of the team—in the face of attendance that had dwindled to nearly nothing—were forced to overhaul the team. McGraw was given his release from the team, but Kenney also loaned him $70 and wished him luck if he wanted to try to catch on with another squad. McGraw could not <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> going home a failure, as both his father and Mary Goddard had urged him to stay home and take a regular job, instead of chasing his dream of being a ballplayer. McGraw was resolute in his determination to make a name for himself as a professional baseball player, even if that meant struggling along in poverty for a time.|$|E

500|$|Kanhopatra's abhangas {{frequently}} portray {{her struggle}} between her profession and her devotion to Vithoba, the patron deity of the Varkaris. She presents {{herself as a}} woman deeply devoted to Vithoba, and pleads for him to save her from the unbearable bondage of her profession. Kanhopatra speaks of her humiliation and her banishment from society owing to her profession and social stature. She expresses disgust for the society which adored her {{as an object of}} beauty rather than as a human being, and abhorred her for profession. She describes how she has been the object of lustful thoughts. She worries that she was beyond the [...] "scope of God's love". In Nako Devaraya Anta Aata—believed to be the last abhanga of her life—unable to <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> separation from her Lord, Kanhopatra begs Vithoba to end her misery.|$|E

The day before her death she {{wrote in a letter}} to Dorothy: [...] "On Monday I was taken suddenly ill with gall bladder trouble—awful pain—sent for Doctor Barnes—he gave me dope & an injection and pain gradually went... He says I am going on all right, but of course I feel rather a wreck". She died the following day of a heart attack. John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre of my life in London and during all that time we have never had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference. When I first met her she was in her late twenties but in looks a lovely young girl. When she died she was a lovely old woman... She came of a long line of soldiers and during the last war thought it her duty to stay in London through all the air raids. She was not more lovely than distinguished—no matter what happened she never lost her solitude... For the moment I cannot <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> London. I will find her memory everywhere.|$|E

60|$|The truth is, the {{circumstances}} he was in, the passionate expressions of his letter, the kind, gentlemanly treatment I had {{from him in}} all the affair, with the concern he showed for me in it, his manner of parting with that large share which he gave me of his little stock left--all these had joined to make such impressions on me, that I really loved him most tenderly, and could not <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> parting with him.|$|R

They would neither of them have him, and sent him {{backward}} and forward from one another, not being able to <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> marrying a man who had a blue beard, and what besides gave them disgust and aversion was his having already been married to several wives, and nobody ever knew what became of them.|$|R
500|$|In May 2013, Morrow {{spoke with}} Michael Logan of TV Guide, {{revealing}} {{that the question}} of Summer's paternity would be visited, as Nick's [...] "game-changing deception" [...] would be uncovered. It later revealed onscreen that Summer may in fact not be his daughter; the paternity results read only by Nick years ago were inconclusive. Logan called it [...] "messy development", stating that his character may be [...] "trashed forever". According to Morrow, after Cassie's death, Nick withheld the fact that the results were corrupted because [...] "he just couldn't <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> losing Summer, too", but called it [...] "out of character". [...] "But now he's freaking out because there's a good likelihood that Summer and Kyle are brother and sister," [...] he stated. Nick later secretly does another test using hair from Summer's hairbrush, which comes back conclusive. Later that May, Morrow stated during an interview with TV Buzz that Nick would be devastated by the paternity test outcome; confirming that Summer is in fact Jack's daughter. He stated that Nick is [...] "terrified" [...] of the potential repercussions and the reactions, from Jack, Sharon, Noah, and most importantly Summer. However, months later it was revealed that the paternity test results were actually switched by Nick's ex-wife Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), while she was off her bipolar medication, in a ploy to win Nick back, meaning that he is in fact Summer's biological father after all. Sharon's secret has yet to be revealed. Speaking of the forthcoming reveal, King stated, [...] "I'm very curious as to how they're going to play it out with Summer. I'm sure she's still going to have the close bond that she now has with Jack." ...|$|E

In her testimony in court, Prem's sister Mamie Ahuja, stated that Prem had agreed to marry Sylvia, provided she divorced her husband. However, this was contradicted by the letters written by Sylvia (admitted as Sylvia's testimony), where she expressed her desire to divorce Nanavati and marry Prem, but she doubted whether Prem had the same intentions. In a letter dated 24 May 1960, she wrote [...] "Last night when you spoke of your marrying me and the various other girls you might marry, something inside me snapped and I knew I could not <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> your loving someone else…".|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} Hunt's suicide, Pearson {{published}} his charges about how Republican Senators had threatened Hunt, but described Hunt's motives as complex: [...] "Two weeks ago {{he went to}} the hospital for a physical check and announced that he would not run again.

[...] In private, he confirmed that Hunt had no serious health problem and wrote in his diary that [...] "Unfortunately I am afraid that the morals charge against his son and the experience Hunt suffered was the main factor." ...|$|E

His Grace was magnanimous enough to offer to take Mr. Esmond as secretary on his Paris embassy, but no doubt he intended that proposal should be rejected; at any rate, Esmond could not <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> attending his mistress farther than the church-door after her marriage, and so declined that offer which his generous rival made him.|$|R

[...] And by this time, {{being a little}} recovered, I told her what {{discourse}} my husband and the captain had had together, and what the captain had said. This put Amy into such a hurry that she cried, she raved, she swore and cursed like a mad thing; then she upbraided me that I would not let her kill the girl when she would have done it, {{and that it was}} all my own doing, and the like. Well, however, I was not for killing the girl yet. I could not <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> that neither.|$|R
60|$|Aunt Roger {{came up to}} {{announce}} that dinner was ready, and to beg that she might stay with Fred while the rest went down. Mrs. Frederick Langford only shook her head, and thanked her, saying with a painful smile that it was impossible, but begging Uncle Geoffrey and Henrietta to go. The former complied, knowing how much alarm his absence would create downstairs; but Henrietta declared {{that she could not}} <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> going down, and it was only by a positive order that he succeeded in making her come with him. Grandpapa kissed her, and made her sit by him, and grandmamma loaded her plate with all that was best on the table, but she looked at it with disgust, and leaning back in her chair, faintly begged not to be asked to eat.|$|R
2500|$|Unable to <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{continuing}} {{to live with}} Townsend at Maytham, Burnett rented a house in London for the winter of 1900–1901. There she socialized with friends and wrote. [...] She worked on two books simultaneously: The Shuttle, a longer and more complicated book; and The Making of a Marchioness, which she wrote {{in a few weeks}} and published to good reviews. In the spring of 1901, when she returned to the country, Townsend tried to replace her long-time publisher Scribner's with a publishing house offering a larger advance. In 1902, after a summer of socializing and filling Maytham with house-guests, she suffered a physical collapse that autumn. She returned to America, and in the winter of 1902 entered a sanatorium. There she told Townsend she would no longer live with him, and the marriage ended.|$|E

60|$|These were {{unusual and}} {{unexpected}} honours to us, who, {{but for this}} stratagem of the French commission, had been declared enemies. It was suggested to me here, that I might with great ease surprise the whole island, nay, all the islands, the governor putting such confidence in us, that we might go on shore in the very fort unsuspected. But though this was true, and that we did play them a trick at the Rio de la Plata, I could not <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> it here; besides, I had quite another game to play, which would turn out more advantageous to us and to our voyage, than an enterprise of so much treachery could be to England, which also we {{might not be able}} to support from thence, before the Spaniards might beat us out again from Acapulco, and then we might pass our time ill enough.|$|R

60|$|As {{to keeping}} the thing in our own breasts, and letting it all remain as it was, I {{told her it was}} impossible; and I asked her how she could think I could <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> lying with my own brother. In the next place, I told her that her being alive was the only support of the discovery, and that while she owned me for her child, and saw reason to be {{satisfied}} that I was so, nobody else would doubt it; but that if she should die before the discovery, I should be taken for an impudent creature that had forged such a thing to go away from my husband, or should be counted crazed and distracted. Then I told her how he had threatened already to put me into a madhouse, and what concern I had been in about it, and how that was the thing that drove me to the necessity of discovering it to her as I had done.|$|R

60|$|At length we shifted our ground, and {{determined}} to make a descent upon the road between Terracina and Naples. In {{the course of our}} expedition, we passed a day or two in the woody mountains which rise above Frosinone. I cannot tell you how I felt when I looked down upon the place, and distinguished the residence of Rosetta. I determined to have an interview with her; but to what purpose? I could not expect that she would quit her home, and accompany me in my hazardous life among the mountains. She had been brought up too tenderly for that; and when I looked upon the women who were associated with some of our troop, I could not have <b>borne</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> her being their companion. All return to my former life was likewise hopeless; for a price was set upon my head. Still I determined to see her; the very hazard and fruitlessness of the thing made me furious to accomplish it.|$|R
60|$|He told me {{he could}} not promise that for himself, and thought he ought not to trust himself with the opportunity, for that, as he had failed already, he was loth to lead himself into the temptation of {{offending}} again, {{and that this was}} the true reason of his resolving to go back to Paris; not that he could willingly leave me, and would be very far from wanting my invitation; but if he could not stay upon terms that became him, either as an honest man or a Christian, what could he do? And he hoped, he said, I could not blame him that he was unwilling anything that was to call him father should upbraid him with leaving him in the world to be called bastard; adding that he was astonished to think how I could satisfy myself to be so cruel to an innocent infant not yet born; professed he could neither <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> it, much less bear to see it, and hoped I would not take it ill that he could not stay to see me delivered, for that very reason.|$|R
60|$|But my {{measure of}} wickedness {{was not yet}} full. I {{continued}} obstinate against matrimony, and yet I could not <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> his going away neither.

I told him I would promise him it should never come to him to upbraid him with its being illegitimate; {{that if it was}} a boy, I would breed it up like the son of a gentleman, and use it well for his sake; and after a little more such talk as this, and seeing him resolved to go, I retired, but could not help letting him see the tears run down my cheeks. He came to me and kissed me, entreated me, conjured me by the kindness he had shown me in my distress, by the justice he had done me in my bills and money affairs, by the respect which made him refuse a thousand pistoles from me for his expenses with that traitor the Jew, by the pledge of our misfortunes--so he called it--which I carried with me, and by all that the sincerest affection could propose to do, that I would not drive him away.|$|R
