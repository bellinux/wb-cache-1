Bunker expected a 20-year sentence, <b>but</b> <b>thanks</b> to the solicitations of influential friends and a lenient judge, he got only five years.|$|E
25|$|Several {{detailed}} {{studies of}} Pepys' life are available. Arthur Bryant published his three-volume study in 1933–1938, {{long before the}} definitive edition of the diary, <b>but,</b> <b>thanks</b> to Bryant's lively style, it is still of interest. In 1974 Richard Ollard produced a new biography that drew on Latham's and Matthew's work on the text, benefitting from the author's deep knowledge of Restoration politics. Other biographies include: Samuel Pepys : a life, by Stephen Coote (London : Hodder & Stoughton, 2000) and, Samuel Pepys and his world, by Geoffrey Trease (London : Thames and Hudson, 1972).|$|E

25|$|Although the South started {{early to}} build railways, it {{concentrated}} on short lines linking cotton regions to oceanic or river ports {{and the absence}} of an interconnected network was a major handicap during the Civil War. The North and Midwest constructed networks that linked every city by 1860. In the heavily settled the Midwestern Corn Belt, over 80 percent of farms were within 10 miles of a railway, facilitating the shipment of grain, hogs and cattle to national and international markets. A large number of short lines were built, <b>but</b> <b>thanks</b> to a fast developing financial system based on Wall Street and oriented to railway bonds, the majority were consolidated into 20 trunk lines by 1890. State and local governments often subsidized lines, but rarely owned them.|$|E

Finally, in Game 4, Jon Lester took Tim Wakefield's spot in the rotation and gave the Sox an impressive start, pitching 5⅔ shutout innings. The Rockies threatened, <b>but</b> <b>thanks</b> to World Series MVP Mike Lowell and aided by a pinch-hit home run by outfielder Bobby Kielty, Papelbon registered another save as the Red Sox swept the Rockies in four games.
