50|$|In SpongeBob Moves In!, {{players can}} {{customize}} {{the look of}} Bikini Bottom with different characters, buildings, and accessories. In the ongoing quest to keep the residents happy by granting their wishes, players must fill the town's happiness meter by collecting happiness. The Bikini <b>Bottom</b> <b>inhabitants</b> wish for food and gifts from various Bikini Bottom establishments, such as Krabby Patties from the Krusty Krab. Once their wish is granted, the player can collect gold coins, happiness, or a recipe to add to their collection. When the happiness meter is filled, players advance {{to the next level}} in the game, earning coins, game experience, and unlocking more quests, buildings, and accessories to buy in the store.Throughout the game, players earn gold coins and jellyfish jelly as rewards for performing various activities like fulfilling wishes, adding buildings, making recipes, collecting rent, and expanding their city. Players can purchase additional land area, ingredients, buildings, and decorations using the game coins and jellyfish jelly they earned.|$|E
30|$|OTU 28 {{corresponds}} to Prodiamesa olivacea, {{which can be}} easily described in all stages [44], resulting in more extensive ecological information being available on this species. Larvae of P. olivacea are <b>bottom</b> <b>inhabitants</b> and are rarely found on stones or among vegetation [71]. They can be numerous in organic silt and over-represented in sand with coarse and fine detritus [70]. The {{results of this study}} are in broad agreement with the aforementioned findings, as P. olivacea was almost exclusively found in the streambed and increased further with added fine sediment. In addition, P. olivacea responded positively to reduced flow velocity in this study. Even though the larvae are scarce in stagnant water, they are known to thrive well in stretches with a slow flow when enough decomposing material and silt is available [44]. Despite rarely being found in brackish waters and being classified as haloxenic (“salinity tolerance class 1 ”; [44, 49, 63]), the species was not affected by an increase in salinity in this study, suggesting that it can tolerate a certain increase in salinity.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} thatmotivate animals to hold or abandon a {{valuable}} resource is a central goal of behavioral ecology, the study of which will grow {{more important in the}} face of increasingly frequent extreme events. We compared the shell-abandoning behavior of the sympatric hermit crabs Clibanarius antillensis and Pagurus criniticornis in response to simulated burial and entrapment by rocks and other debris. While these hazards are relatively common in dynamic intertidal habitats, the frequency and severity of such disturbance are increasing due to human activity. While both species exhibited shell-abandoning behavior in response to experimental burial, it was far more prevalent for the soft-bottom dwelling species P. criniticornis (90 %) when compared to the rocky <b>bottom</b> <b>inhabitant</b> C. antillensis (55 %). Simulated entrapment experiments highlighted further differences in species response, with the decision to abandon domicile shells again far more common for P. criniticornis (80 %) than it was for C. antillensis (10 %). Given the tendency for P. criniticornis to abandon its shell, we subsequently focused on this species to test specific hypothesis about subjective resource value in hermit crabs. There was no difference in the tendency for this species to abandon optimal or sub-optimal (poorly-fitting) shells when faced with the immediate and potentially fatal risk of burial. This contrasted the response seen under conditions of entrapment, whereby individuals inhabiting sub-optimal shells abandoned them more rapidly and in greater numbers than those inhabiting optimal shells. Combining these two outcomes, we suggest that hermit crabs subjectively assess shell-value and respond according {{to the nature of the}} disturbance and its associated risks (i. e., high-value shells are abandoned in minutes under conditions of burial; but are held for hours under the less severe conditions of entrapment). In effect, the results show that extrinsic environmental cues can be just as important to decision making processes as those intrinsic cues that govern an animal's physiological condition. The contrasting behavior of the two hermit crabs to the movement of mud and other debris may lead to a higher survivorship of P. criniticornis than C. antillensis where activities such as dredging and harbor construction are intensifying along developing coastlines...|$|R
