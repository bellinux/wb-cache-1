40|$|Abstract: Background. The {{natural history}} of <b>Barrett's</b> Oeosphagus is not {{completely}} clarified and <b>Barrett's</b> Oeosphagus Registries are considered useful tools to expand our knowledge on this disease. A <b>Barrett's</b> Oeosphagus Registry has been therefore established in the Veneto Region and neighbouring provinces. Aims. The aims of the Registry are to assess the demographical, endoscopical and histological characteristics of <b>Barrett's</b> Oeosphagus patients; the prevalence of non-invasive neoplasia and <b>Barrett's</b> Adenocarcinoma and the timing and incidence of <b>Barrett's</b> Oeosphagus progression to malignancy. Methods. An interdisciplinary committee of endoscopists, pathologists and information technology experts was established in 2004 to design a website-based <b>Barrett's</b> Oesophagus Registry for the Veneto Region and neighbouring north-eastern Italian provinces. Protocols for endoscopies and biopsies and standard reports were carefully defined. Results. In the first 18 months, 397 patients with endoscopically visible and histologically proven <b>Barrett's</b> Oeosphagus {{were enrolled in the}} Registry; the median age of these patients was 66 years (male:female= 3 : 1). Most patients (75 %) had a Short Segment of <b>Barrett's</b> Oesophagus (3 cm). Long Segment of <b>Barrett's</b> Oesophagus patients were 5 years older than the Short Segment of <b>Barrett's</b> Oesophagus patients (p < 0. 05), suggesting a progression from Short Segment of <b>Barrett's</b> Oesophagus to Long Segment of <b>Barrett's</b> Oesophagus. Though no data are available on the incidence of non-invasive neoplasia or <b>Barrett's</b> Adenocarcinoma (i. e., progression to cancer at least 12 months after enrolment), the prevalence of neoplastic lesions (found within 12 months of enrolment) was 5 % for Short Segment of <b>Barrett's</b> Oesophagus and 19 % for Long Segment of <b>Barrett's</b> Oesophagus, indicating that a careful multiple-biopsy endoscopic protocol is needed, especially when Long Segment of <b>Barrett's</b> Oesophagus are suspected at endoscopy. The prevalence of <b>Barrett's</b> Adenocarcinoma among patients with non-invasive neoplasia was 1 / 17 cases of low-grade non-invasive neoplasia and 2 / 3 cases of high-grade non-invasive neoplasia, indicating that these patients require strict endoscopic and bioptic follow-up. Conclusion. A regional <b>Barrett's</b> Oeosphagus Registry is feasible at a relatively low cost and enables significant data to be collected in a relatively short time. The use of a standardised endoscopic nomenclature and report form, a strict biopsy protocol, a standard report for pathologists improves the quality of endoscopic and histological diagnoses...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the shape and length of <b>Barrett’s</b> epithelium are associated with prevalence of erosive esophagitis. METHODS: A total study population comprised 869 patients who underwent endoscopy during a health checkup at our hospital. The presence and extent of <b>Barrett’s</b> epithelium were diagnosed based on the Prague C & M Criteria. We originally classified cases of <b>Barrett’s</b> epithelium into two types based on its shape, namely, flame-like and lotus-like <b>Barrett’s</b> epithelium, and into two groups based on its length, its C extent < 2 cm, and ≥ 2 cm. Correlation of shape and length of <b>Barrett’s</b> epithelium with erosive esophagitis was examined. RESULTS: <b>Barrett’s</b> epithelium was diagnosed in 374 cases (43 %). Most of these were diagnosed as short-segment <b>Barrett’s</b> epithelium. The prevalence of erosive esophagitis was significantly higher in subjects with flame-like than lotus-like <b>Barrett’s</b> epithelium, and in those with a C extent of ≥ 2 cm than < 2 cm.

40|$|<b>Barrett’s</b> {{esophagus}} {{is characterized}} by the erosive replacement of esophageal squamous epithelium by a range of metaplastic glandular phenotypes. These glandular phenotypes likely change over time, and their distribution varies along the <b>Barrett’s</b> segment. Although much recent work has addressed <b>Barrett’s</b> esophagus from the genomic viewpoint—its genotype space—the fact that the phenotype of <b>Barrett’s</b> esophagus is nonstatic points to conversion between phenotypes and suggests that <b>Barrett’s</b> esophagus also exists in phenotype space. Here we explore this latter concept, investigating the scope of glandular phenotypes in <b>Barrett’s</b> esophagus and how they exist in physical and temporal space as well as their evolution and their life history. We conclude that individual <b>Barrett’s</b> glands are clonal units; because of this important fact, we propose that it is the <b>Barrett’s</b> gland that is the unit of selection in phenotypic and indeed neoplastic progression. Transition between metaplastic phenotypes may be governed by neutral drift akin to niche turnover in normal and dysplastic niches. In consequence, the phenotype of <b>Barrett’s</b> glands assumes considerable importance, and we make a strong plea for the integration of the <b>Barrett’s</b> gland in both genotype and phenotype space in future work...|$|R
40|$|The {{precursor}} metaplastic mucosal lesion that predisposes for esophageal adenocarcinoma is <b>Barrett's</b> esophagus.

Peptide arrays, exhibiting 1, 176 specific consensus sequences for protein kinases, were used to produce a global analysis of cellular kinase activity in biopsies of <b>Barrett's</b> esophagus, and results were compared with the neighboring cardia and squamous epithelia. Several differences in kinase activity using immunoblot analysis and enzyme activity assays were validated in biopsies of 27 <b>Barrett's</b> esophagus patients. Three unique kinome profiles are described and compared. We identified cascades of activated kinases showing that mitogen-activated protein kinase and epidermal growth factor receptor activity are both significantly altered in <b>Barrett's</b> esophagus compared with squamous and gastric cardia epithelia. Another novel finding is that the glycolysis pathway is significantly up-regulated in <b>Barrett's</b> esophagus, which is illustrated by an up-regulated pyruvate kinase activity.

For the same reason, the 20 patients with <b>Barrett's</b> oesophagus also underwent 24 hour continuous oesophageal pH monitoring, and the results obtained were {{compared with those of}} 20 oesophagitis patients without <b>Barrett's</b> oesophagus (10 with mild oesophagitis and 10 with severe oesophagitis). The manometric results show that the motor changes found in the <b>Barrett's</b> group are specific but similar to the motor dysfunction associated with reflux oesophagitis. Motor anomalies are probably related more to the inflammatory process in the oesophageal wall than to the metaplastic changes themselves. The pH monitoring results show that while reflux in the <b>Barrett's</b> oesophagus patients was greater overall than in the oesophagitis group without <b>Barrett's</b> oesophagus, the changes are similar when the results are compared with the severe oesophagitis group.

40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{incidence}} of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has increased greatly. <b>Barrett's</b> oesophagus is a known risk factor.  AIMS—To identify {{changes in the}} incidence, prevalence, and outcome of <b>Barrett's</b> oesophagus in a defined population.  SUBJECTS—Residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, with clinically diagnosed <b>Barrett's</b> oesophagus, or oesophageal or oesophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma.  METHODS—Cases were identified using the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records linkage system. Records were reviewed with follow up to 1  January 1998.  RESULTS—The {{incidence of}} clinically diagnosed <b>Barrett's</b> oesophagus (> 3 cm) increased 28 -fold from 0. 37 / 100 000  person years in 1965 - 69 to 10. 5 / 100 000  in 1995 - 97. Of note, gastroscopic examinations increased 22 -fold in this same time period. The prevalence of diagnosed <b>Barrett's</b> oesophagus increased from 22. 6  (95 % confidence interval (CI) 11. 7 - 33. 6) per 100   000  in 1987  to 82. 6 / 100 000  in 1998.  The prevalence of short segment <b>Barrett's</b> oesophagus (< 3 cm) in 1998  was 33. 4 / 100   000.  Patients with <b>Barrett's</b> oesophagus had shorter than expected survival but only one patient with <b>Barrett's</b> oesophagus died from adenocarcinoma. Only four of 64  adenocarcinomas {{occurred in patients with}} previously known <b>Barrett's</b> oesophagus.  CONCLUSIONS—The incidence and prevalence of clinically diagnosed <b>Barrett's</b> oesophagus have increased in parallel with the increased use of endoscopy.
