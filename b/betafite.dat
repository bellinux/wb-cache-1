5000|$|<b>Betafite</b> is {{a mineral}} {{group in the}} {{pyrochlore}} supergroup, with the chemical formula (Ca,U)2(Ti,Nb,Ta)2O6(OH). <b>Betafite</b> typically occurs as a primary mineral in granite pegmatites, rarely in carbonatites. Defined by the B-site atom Ti, Atencio et al.(2010) combined and considered the ideas portrayed in (Hatert and Burke)(2008) and a modernization of (Hogarth)(1977) system for nomenclature of pyrochlore and <b>betafite</b> {{in order to further}} rationalize the naming process of this grouping of minerals. Therefore, Atencio et al. (2010), states that only two of the mineral species that were formerly recognized under the previous nomenclature system of <b>betafite</b> in Hogarth (1977) are now recognized. They are oxyuranobetafite and oxycalciobetafite. Now the term <b>betafite</b> is a synonym or varietal group name under the pyrochlore super group (Christy and Atencio 2013).|$|E

40|$|<b>Betafite</b> is a uranium–titanium–tantalum–niobium complex oxide mineral {{generally}} {{described as}} (Ca,U) 2 (Ti,Nb,Ta) 2 O 6 (OH). Significantly lower uranium extractions {{have been observed}} when <b>betafite</b> containing ores has been treated via conventional process flow sheets.

The leaching kinetics and reaction mechanism of uranium from a natural, metamict <b>betafite</b> sample have been investigated using varied temperature under oxidative acidic conditions. The practically complete extraction of uranium was observed by leaching the natural <b>betafite</b> in a solution containing 214. 5 g/L H 2 SO 4 and 2. 0 g/L Fe 3 + at 89 °C for a period of 48 h.

40|$|The {{usage of}} nuclear power, to {{generate}} base-load electricity, has steadily increased in acceptance {{as a more}} environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels since its first commercial introduction in the 1950 s. Increasing consumption of uranium and the rising demand for nuclear fuel {{has led to a}} deficiency of high grade uraninite and pitchblende deposits. This has led to increased attention on the refractory uranium pyrochlore <b>betafite</b> due to its abundance in currently exploited uranium deposits. In this document primary work was conducted on natural <b>betafite</b> from Ambatofotsy Madagascar, Miarinarivo Madagascar and Silver Crater Mine, Canada. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that anatase was the only crystalline compound present in each of the unheated samples. After being heated to 1200 &deg;C all samples exhibited diffraction lines characteristic of <b>betafite</b> and rutile, indicating that the <b>betafite</b> present in the preheated samples was amorphous (metamict). Electron probe microanalysis of the samples showed a high degree of compositional heterogeneity throughout each sample, most likely caused by aqueous fluid interactions forming secondary alteration products. All unheated samples were subject to a sulfuric acid leach over 6 h with the extent of uranium dissolution correlated with the degree of alteration. The most highly altered sample had 42 % U dissolution while the least-altered exhibited only 7 %. Due to the differences in the degree of alteration observed in the natural samples it was decided to synthesise a pure <b>betafite</b> sample via a solid state synthesis route. The optimum conditions for the synthesis of <b>betafite</b> were found to be heating the reactants required at 1150 &deg;C for 48 h under an inert gas atmosphere. XPS analysis of the sample showed that the uranium in the synthesised <b>betafite</b> was predominately present in the U 5 + oxidation state. A minor amount of U 6 + was also detected which was possibly due to surface oxidation. Dissolution studies were then conducted on the synthetic <b>betafite</b> to investigate the influence of various parameters on leaching. The results showed the uranium dissolution curves obtained over a range of experimental conditions demonstrated three discrete segments representing significantly different rates of uranium dissolution. The first segment occurred in the initial minute and involved extremely rapid dissolution. This segment made up {{for the majority of the}} overall uranium dissolution obtained over the test period (~ 2. 0 % U). The second segment between 1 &ndash; 120 minutes was characterised by slow uranium dissolution rates which could be partially influenced by altering the experimental conditions. The uranium dissolution rate in the third segment was negligible due to passivation of the sample surface leaving no exposed uranium available for leaching. Long term dissolution studies were also conducted on the synthetic <b>betafite</b> sample in order to determine the leach rate over a 90 day leach period. The results of these experiments showed very minor influences were observed when each of the standard parameters (temperature, [H 2 SO 4], [FeTOT] and redox potential) were studied. The influence of fluoride addition showed a slightly greater leach rate than that achieved with high acid concentration, though the main difference between this experiment and other experiments conducted with no fluoride was the solubilisation of the metals Ti, Nb and Ta which were not observed to leach in experiments where fluoride was not added. Post leach characterisation of synthetic <b>betafite</b> identified only minor changes occurred in the sample. These changes included the formation of pyrochlore and a greater concentration of rutile was observed to be present. Analysis via XPS of the post leach residues showed the samples contained similar U oxidation states to those observed in the preleached samples. Moreover, significantly greater Ta was observed via XPS in the post leach sample indicating that the Ta concentration had increased on the surface of the mineral. This indicated a possible passivation layer which caused the low rate of dissolution that was observed to occur...|$|E

Alteration processes are documented by the formation of two types of co-existing secondary veins associated with primary apatite and calcite: (i) amorphous Fe-rich veins, 46 - 75 wt. % of FeO, and ~ 500 ppm of UO 2, and (ii) crystalline calcite-rich veins, found in fractures and penetrating the pyrochlore.

Th-enrichment {{is accompanied by a}} decrease in Na, LREE, Sr and increase in A-site vacancies. The most Th-rich composition approaches (Na 0. 39 LREE 0. 19 Th 0. 12 Ca 0. 05 Sr 0. 02) S 0. 77 (Ti 0. 76 Nb 0. 27) S 1. 03 O 3. The mineral is partly or completely metamict and after annealing gives an X-ray diffraction powder pattern similar to that of synthetic NaLaTi 2 O 6 and naturally occurring loparite of different composition. For the Th-rich rim sample, the five strongest diffraction lines (AÊ) are: 2. 72 (100) 110, 1. 575 (60) 211, 1. 925 (40), 1. 368 (30) 220, 1. 222 (20) 310; a = 3. 867 (2) AÊ. The X-ray diffraction patterns do not exhibit peak splitting or other diffraction lines typical of low-symmetry and ordered perovskite-type structures. Composition determinations, infrared transmission spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry show that thorian loparite is partly replaced by <b>betafite</b> with LREE and Th as dominant A-site cations (‘ceriobetafite’). Some loparite samples also exhibit thin replacement mantles of belyankinite with high LREE 2 O 3 and ThO 2 contents. Both ‘ceriobetafite ’ and belyankinite were formed due to metasomatic alteration of loparite...|$|E
40|$|The Damaran belt in Namibia {{represents}} a highly eroded orogenic area, the root zone {{of which is}} exposed between Swakopmund on the coast and Karibib in the west. Primary uranium deposits located in these structurally lower regions of the orogen, have been studied {{in an attempt to}} assess the importance of geological processes associated with remobilization in the genesis of the uraniferous Damaran granitoids. The pre-Damaran basement consists of a sequence of up to 1600 m of shallow water clastic and carbonate rocks with interbedded metabasaltic and pyroclastic horizons. The 'meta-basalts' range in composition from basalt to andesite, and are characterized by chemical features diagnostic of a tholeiitic, and in some cases komatiitic affinity. This sequence, previously assigned to the Abbabis Formation, is intruded locally by 2. 0 Ga gneisses which range in composition from diorites, through granodiorites to alkali-rich granites. Pb-isotope ratios of sulphides from the basement and the Damaran metasedimentary cover indicate that the basement was enriched in U/Pb at 1. 7 Ga, and that the Damaran uranium province has been in existence for at least 1. 7 Ga. The Damara Sequence consists of a lower Nosib Group and an upper Swakop Group. The former consists of fluviatile clastics (Etusis Formation), followed by shallow-water calcareous, feldspathic sandstones (Khan Formation). Uranium minerals, in the form of uranyl silicate inclusions, found within detrital constituents of the Etusis quartzites, provide direct evidence of radioactive material within the pre-Damaran basement prior to its erosion, transportation and deposition within the ii. Damara Sequence. The Swakop Group {{represents a}} typical geosynclinals sequence starting with carbonates, quartzites, conglomerates and pelites (Rossing Formation); followed by mixtites (Chuos Formation) and a dominantly calcareous succession (Karibib Formation); and ending with a monotonous series of biotite schists (Kuiseb Formation). Primary uranium minerals including uraninite and <b>betafite</b> located within schists and calc silicates of the Rossing Formation are considered to have recrystallized during the Damaran metamorphism from syngenetic uranium associated with stratabound copper deposits. The Damaran belt underwent regional deformation between about 650 and 550 Ma, and although early mafic granitoids were emplaced locally, the major granite forming event post-dates the major regional deformation. Between 540 and 46 O Ma dome structures were developed by a process involving diapirism and the upward movement and subsequent ballooning of large volumes of granitic material. The Damaran granitoids may be broadly divided into syn- to post-tectonic Salem type granites and red granites, and late- to post-tectonic leucogranites and alaskites. Field relationships indicate that the Salem type granites are derived from a source deeper than the Damara Sequence, whilst the alaskites appear to be derived from migmatized basement and Damaran metasedimentary cover rocks. The earlier Damaran granitoids, which tend to be more mafic in character, show relatively low Sr-isotope ratios and contain chemical and mineralogical features in common with I-type granitoids. These various factors are considered to reflect derivation from the lower crust or upper mantle. In contrast the later granitoids are normally leucocratic in nature, commonly radioactive and occasionally mineralized. They display relatively high Sr-isotope ratios, and an affinity with S-type granitoids, and they are considered to be derived from basement and Nosib source rocks. The mineralized alaskites contain primary uranium minerals including uraninite, <b>betafite</b> and metamict thorite which crystallized from melts enriched in IJ and Th. Primary mineralizations are not restricted to alaskites, but also occur within red granites. Secondary uranium minerals within the mineralized Damaran granitoids include uranyl silicate, thorogummite, calciothorite, ferrothorite and uranophane. These minerals formed during a deuteric stage of alteration, and also during a recent stage of surface enrichment and secondary alteration. ...|$|E
40|$|We here {{present results}} of a crystal-chemical study of a suite of pyrochlore-group {{minerals}} front the holocrystalline syenitic ejecta scattered within the Plio-Pleistocene pyroclastic deposits of Latium, in central Italy. Despite their high actinide content, the samples Studied are non-metamict owing to their young age of formation, {{as suggested by the}} well-defined and sharp peaks in the X-ray powder-diffraction pattern. The measured a unit-cell dimension is correlated with the (Ti + Fe 3 +) content at the B site of the structure. Following the IMA classification scheme for pyrochlore-group minerals modified according to the " 50 % rule" adopted in 1992, the samples are classified as <b>betafite,</b> pyrochlore and uranpyrochlore. In comparison with known data for pyrochlore-group minerals. the samples have extremely high Ti contents (tip to 81. 3 atom % Ti relative to the Ti + Nb + Ta sum) and significant and variable contents of Zr (up to 8. 44 wt. % ZrO 2) and W (up to 12. 14 Wt-% WO 3). Some crystals display strong compositional zoning, consistent with the substitution 3 Nb(5 +) + Na+ reversible arrow 3 Ti(4 +) + U 4 +. The accommodation of extremely high amounts of W 6 + can be related to the coupled substitution 2 (Nb + Ta) (5 +) reversible arrow Ti 4 + + W 6 + at the B site. Pyrochlore-group minerals from Latium have significantly high REE contents (up to 7. 75 wt. % oxide). Chondrine-normalized patterns follow the general trend typical of unaltered pyrochlore. i. e., with an extreme Ce-enrichment and a decrease toward the heavy REE...|$|E
40|$|The Anjanabonoina rare-element-enriched {{granitic}} pegmatite dikes, {{located about}} 40 km southwest of Betafo, in central Madagascar, are emplaced {{in a complex}} environment characterized by paragneiss, marble and orthogneiss of the Neoproterozoic Itremo Group, of medium metamorphic grade. The subhorizontal bodies of pegmatite are strongly zoned and, in the mineralized area called Sarodivotra, they show a rich paragenetic assemblage in which Ti–Nb–Ta-bearing minerals occur. We recognize two generations of pyrochlore-group and columbite-group minerals. They have a high Nb:Ta ratio, with predominance of Nb- and Ti-dominant phases, and a rare late development of Ta-bearing minerals in fractures. Crystals of the fi rst generation, Nb-dominant (1. 20 – 1. 23 apfu), are pyrochlore, whereas those of the second generation, mainly Ti-dominant, are U-rich <b>betafite</b> (0. 29 – 0. 57 apfu U) and locally pyrochlore. The primary minerals are typical of an NYF-type pegmatite, and contrast with the LCT-type mineralogy (which includes abundant elbaite–liddicoatite, a pink variety of beryl, spodumene, and hambergite) typical {{of much of the}} Anjanabonoina dike. Large crystals of pyrochlore of the fi rst generation are affected by a primary alteration, at high temperature, due to circulation of hydrothermal fl uids, represented by the substitution ACaYO → AY at the core, and by a secondary alteration (at low temperature) along fractures and at the rim, during which the vacancies increased in the A and Y sites. Crystals of the second generation are even more intensely altered. The columbite-group mineral, also formed in two generations and by exsolution in pyrochlore, is fersmite. Rarely, fersmite replaces pyrochlore in the second-generation crystals. We use pyrochlore- and columbite-group minerals to monitor magmatic evolution and postmagmatic events related to circulation of the hydrothermal fl uids and weathering-type reaction...|$|E
40|$|A new {{scheme of}} {{nomenclature}} for the pyrochlore supergroup, {{approved by the}} CNMNC-IMA, {{is based on the}} ions at the A, B and Y sites. What has been referred to until now as the pyrochlore group should be referred to as the pyrochlore supergroup, and the subgroups should be changed to groups. Five groups are recommended, based on the atomic proportions of the B atoms Nb, Ta, Sb, Ti, and W. The recommended groups are pyrochlore, microlite, romite, <b>betafite,</b> and elsmoreite, respectively. The new names are composed of two prefixes and one root name (identical to the name of the group). The first prefix refers to the dominant anion (or cation) of the dominant valence [or H(2) O or rectangle] at the Y site. The second prefix refers to the dominant cation of the dominant valence [or H(2) O or rectangle] at the A site. The prefix "" keno-"" represents "" vacancy"". Where the first and second prefixes are equal, then only one prefix is applied. Complete descriptions are missing {{for the majority of the}} pyrochlore-supergroup species. Only seven names refer to valid species on the grounds of their complete descriptions: oxycalciopyrochlore, hydropyrochlore, hydroxykenomicrolite, oxystannomicrolite, oxystibiomicrolite, hydroxycalcioromite, and hydrokenoelsmoreite. Fluornatromicrolite is an IMA-approved mineral, but the complete description has not yet been published. The following 20 names refer to minerals that need to be completely described in order to be approved as valid species: hydroxycalciopyrochlore, fluornatropyrochlore, fluorcalciopyrochlore, fluorstrontiopyrochlore, fluorkenopyrochlore, oxynatropyrochlore, oxyplumbopyrochlore, oxyyttropyrochlore-(Y), kenoplumbopyrochlore, fluorcalciomicrolite, oxycalciomicrolite, kenoplumbomicrolite, hydromicrolite, hydrokenomicrolite, oxycalciobetafite, oxyuranobetafite, fluornatroromite, fluorcalcioromte, oxycalcioromite, and oxyplumboromite. For these, there are only chemical or crystalstructure data. Type specimens need to be defined. Potential candidates for several other species exist, but are not sufficiently well characterized to grant them any official status. Ancient chemical data refer to wet-chemical analyses and commonly represent a mixture of minerals. These data were not used here. All data used represent results of electron-microprobe analyses or were obtained by crystal-structure refinement. We also verified the scarcity of crystal-chemical data in the literature. There are crystalstructure determinations published for only nine pyrochlore-supergroup minerals: hydropyrochlore, hydroxykenomicrolite, hydroxycalcioromite, hydrokenoelsmoreite, hydroxycalciopyrochlore, fluorcalciopyrochlore, kenoplumbomicrolite, oxycalciobetafite, and fluornatroromite.
