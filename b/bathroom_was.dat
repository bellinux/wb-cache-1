5|$|During World War II, {{and after}} Perry Ellwood died in 1943, May Ellwood again altered the home; {{to save on}} fuel oil, she had the upper floors of the house closed off. During this period, the library functioned as a guest room and a <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> added across the library's west wall. The <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> removed before the house opened as a museum in 1967. The library's plaster cornice and other {{architectural}} details have been restored based on a 1912 photograph. In 1964 the home was donated {{to the city of}} DeKalb and converted into a museum.|$|E
25|$|At some point, {{even the}} prisoners who were {{thought of as}} role models and obeyed all of the guards' {{commands}} were being punished. Going to the <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> considered a privilege rather than a necessity, and those who acted out against the guards were made to urinate and defecate in a bucket in their cell.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{of the house was}} much smaller than the year before. The living room was brought back inside the house, with two glass doors separating it from the main floor area. On Launch Night, McCall said the room will change colour depending on what mood the housemates were in, however the walls only changed colour on eviction nights. The bedroom was across from the living room, and featured a waterbed, the <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> accessed through the bedroom, and featured a bath, shower and also a toilet. The kitchen was small and beside the door leading to the garden. In the garden, which was much larger than the house, was a barbecue, a pool, a seating area and a bridge titled The Bridge to Nowhere which led to another seating area. The interior stairs remained closed off once again, and had a yellow and black theme.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bathrooms</b> <b>are</b> {{located on}} the 2nd and 3rd floors of the main building. <b>Bathrooms</b> <b>are</b> also located in the gymnasium, the kirin building, the modern {{languages}} building and the cafeteria.|$|R
50|$|The {{second floor}} {{contains}} 5 bedrooms, two dressing rooms and two <b>bathrooms.</b> The <b>bathrooms</b> <b>are</b> decorated in 22K gold trim, mirroring the <b>bathroom</b> below, which <b>is</b> decorated with 22K gold and ruby marble. The <b>bathrooms</b> <b>are</b> fed {{water from a}} 540 gal tank on the third floor, used as for storage or other amenities.|$|R
50|$|Furo {{are part}} of the Japanese ritual of bathing, not meant for washing but rather for {{relaxing}} and warming oneself. Washing is carried out separately outside the yubune. The bather should enter the water only after rinsing or lightly showering. Generally Japanese <b>bathrooms</b> <b>are</b> small by Western standards, so the <b>bathroom</b> <b>is</b> set up much like a walk-in shower area but containing the furo. Since the <b>bathroom</b> <b>is</b> a complete wet-area, in modern buildings and ryokan heating is provided by air conditioners overhead. The water is hot, usually approximately 100 to 108 degrees F (38 to 42 degrees Celsius).|$|R
25|$|In 1934 Concrete {{reinforcements}} {{were added}} to the foundation, as well as the center beam being braced, in order to stop some settling of the building which was occurring. Also in 1934, in May, interior plumbing was added and an interior <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> added. Two outbuildings were also upgraded or constructed in 1934. An old rabbit house was converted into a coal shed by pouring a concrete floor and reinforcing the walls, and an open garage was constructed behind the friary. In May 1935, an addition was added, acting as a dining room for the friary. Later in 1935, on November 11, the mission cemetery reached capacity. The Friars began to bury their dead in a cemetery which was near the nearby Visitors Center at Canyon de Chelly National Monument. The burials continued at the new site until the Chinle Community Cemetery was opened on March 30, 1946.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely positive. [...] "Miss Alli" [...] from Television Without Pity have the episode a positive review and rated it an A–. Francis Rizzo III from DVD Talk called the episode [...] "classic", and praised {{the performance of}} Rainn Wilson as Dwight. He noted that the episode, along with several others, [...] "wouldn't be nearly as entertaining" [...] without his character. TV Fanatic reviewed several quotes from [...] "The Fight", and rated Michael's [...] "Would I rather be feared or loved?" [...] soliloquy and Michael's confession that Dwight cried {{at the end of}} Armageddon 5 out of 5. In 2006, Jenna Fischer said that the episode's cold opening, featuring Jim moving Dwight's desk into the <b>bathroom,</b> <b>was</b> her favorite prank on the show.|$|E
500|$|... "Patriot Games" [...] was {{watched by}} 8.45 million viewers, {{making it the}} 55th most-watched program of the week. According to MacFarlane, the episode {{polarized}} viewers, who either [...] "hated or loved the violence". Ryan J. Budke from AOL's TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, specifically praising the scene in which Stewie beats up Brian. Budke also {{said that it was}} [...] "fun" [...] and that you could tell the crew had a good time making it. Overall, he considered it [...] "not a bad episode. The scene eventually {{became one of the most}} popular videos on YouTube." [...] The episode ranked number 1 in IGN's Top 10 Musical Moments in the show, for [...] "Shipoopi," [...] and Brian and Stewie's fight in the <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> named the 5th greatest fight scene in the show on another list.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of sale in 2008, Pikes Hotel had 29 bedrooms, with a pool, sauna, health centre, and tennis court. Today it has 26 rooms with {{king-sized}} beds, one restaurant named Room 39 which has received much critical acclaim, and 2 bars. As of 2009 it costs £157 {{to stay at the}} hotel. The rooms retain the sense of the original farmhouse, and are furnished in the Moroccan style with some heavy dark wood furnishings. The rooms each have different themes, including [...] "Honeysuckle" [...] and [...] "Sunset", the latter of which is set behind the middle of three dark wood doors {{on the second floor of}} a small outhouse. According to author Stephen Armstrong, this room had a [...] "modest sitting room with a huge antique mirror, plush sofas and a CD player which didn't work. The bedroom was enormous, and the <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> decorated in a vaguely Moroccan style with a curtained bath nestling behind a low arch.|$|E
500|$|With a {{shooting}} budget of $700,000, Saw began principal photography on [...] at Lacy Street Production Facility in Los Angeles for 18 days. The <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> the only set {{that had to}} be built. Danny Glover completed his scenes in two days. Due to the tight shooting schedule, Wan could not afford to shoot {{more than a couple of}} takes per actor. [...] "It was a really tough struggle for me. Every day, it was me fighting to get the shots I did not get. I had high aspirations, but there's only so much you can do. I wanted to make it in a very Hitchcockian style of filmmaking, but that style of filmmaking takes time to set up and so on," [...] Wan said about the very short shooting schedule. He said the style instead ended up being [...] "more gritty and rough around the edges due to the lack of time and money that we had to shoot the movie with" [...] and it ultimately became the aesthetic of the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Toxic" [...] was filmed over {{three days in}} December 2003, on a sound-stage in Los Angeles, California. It was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn, who previously worked with Spears on the music video for her 2000 single [...] "Stronger". The editor of the video was David Blackburn, who also edited [...] "Womanizer" [...] and [...] "Do Somethin'". Brad Rushing was the cinematographer. Spears first approached Kahn with a story sketch of a secret agent out for revenge against an ex-lover, to which Kahn created a treatment for. Her concept was almost fully formed and detailed, exemplifying the scene in which she drops water on the passenger's lap. Spears {{said she wanted to}} join the mile high club and be a stewardess that kissed a man in the bathroom. Kahn suggested making him a fat man, so the [...] "common man" [...] would feel represented. Spears also told him about a scene in which she would be naked and covered in diamonds. Kahn stated he was [...] "not sure what I was thinking about when she told me about that scene, maybe those intros to James Bond movies, but every video needs an iconic image to remember, and that's it". The choreography was a collaboration between Brian Friedman and Spears, and every scene had a completely different strictly structured routine. After the treatment was finished, Kahn proceeded to cast his friends and acquaintances, as in most of his projects. The plane passenger in which Spears drops water on was played by his long-time casting director, while the fat man in the <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> played by the casting director's assistant. Spears's boyfriend is played by Martin Henderson, who starred in Kahn's directorial debut Torque.|$|E

2500|$|After closing {{its doors}} to the public, the house {{was used by the}} Texas Gulf Coast Chapter of the American Society of Interior Designers as a showcase. [...] The home was {{redesigned}} at no cost to the GHF. [...] Designers donated their time, and businesses and craftsmen donated an estimated $100,000 worth of materials and time. [...] The redesigned house features wood floors, stenciling in the entryway, and faux crown molding in the dining room. The color palette is now blues, roses, soft yellow, and gold colors, and the furniture is a mix of period piecessome originally owned by the Williams familyand contemporary furniture. [...] The theater was converted to a kitchen, and the <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> upgraded with antique fixtures.|$|E
2500|$|The Cosmos Club made further {{improvements}} in 1893. [...] Electricity was installed, the heating system upgraded, and general refurbishing of commons areas completed. [...] Two additional stories were {{built over the}} assembly hall: The second story consisting of one large room, and a third story consisting of four meeting rooms. A <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> added {{to the third floor}} of the old building, above the existing second-floor bathroom. The eastern garden was removed, and a three-story addition built. The addition consisted of a ground floor with an entrance to the building on H Street NW, a cloakroom, and a connecting door to the assembly hall on the south side of the building; a second story with meeting rooms for the Cosmos Club as well as other societies which might use the premises; and a third story with lodgings and a meeting room for the Cosmos Club's Board of Directors. The basement of the original building was renovated and upgraded to include a kitchen, a bathroom, and an underground passage to the new addition. The goal of building the addition was to permit visiting societies (such as members of the National Geographic Society) to enter and use the building without disturbing members of the Cosmos Club. The total cost of the renovations was $15,000. Hornblower & Marshall were the architects of the addition, which was completed in January 1894.|$|E
2500|$|Mary Hills was not {{particularly}} fond of her wedding gift. [...] First, Wright was not commissioned to design furniture for the Hills; according to their eldest of five sons, John Moore Hills, they felt that [...] "it was their house and they would furnish it for their own taste and comfort." [...] Sibling Nathan Grier further related that his mother found the entire house too [...] "stern and austere" [...] and she immediately hired neighborhood architect Henry Fiddelke to make alterations. Over the next eight years, the rear kitchen wing was extended {{with the addition of}} a pantry and breakfast room (c. 1912), the rear porch was enclosed with glass (c. 1917), a second <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> inserted above the kitchen, and a small second floor balcony was enlarged and covered to form a sleeping porch. [...] The space under the rear porch was excavated to form a children's playroom and billiards room. [...] Most notably, the second floor front (east) bay window – which was initially split between two bedrooms – was reconstructed as two separate bay windows in 1915. [...] In later alterations, the cedar shingle roof was replaced by asphalt shingles which failed to replicate the distinctive tiered pattern. [...] Also, the front porch was expanded and piers on either side of the front steps were replaced by simple iron handrails. (see floor plans at right for details on the alterations) ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, {{the house}} was {{purchased}} by Robert Niosi, Sally Lee, and their family, and Niosi undertook a major renovation of the home: he expanded the kitchen and changed {{the door to the}} servants' quarters into a bookshelf. He also renovated the master bedroom upstairs but left the circular windows alone, expanding the front door window to let more light into the front hallway, and he copper-paneled the front Dutch-style door. In addition, the outdated boiler system was replaced, and the entrance to the living room was widened. Niosi left the exterior relatively unchanged, but he said that when he bought the house, it was very [...] "austere" [...] inside—the walls were simple white or beige in color, with no ornamentation; the only decoration was on the unique Harrison-designed spiral staircase to the second floor, which had brass bamboo supports that Niosi left alone; he stated that the staircase had been built in Japan and exported in one piece. Niosi had previously lived in a Victorian apartment, decorated both inside and out, so when he moved to this Harrison-designed house, it was initially cold and unwelcoming with its simplicity and lack of decoration. To address this, Niosi added more traditional 1930s Mackintosh Arts and Crafts interior wood paneling and William Morris wallpaper in order to decorate and soften the interior of the house and make it more warm and inviting. This redecoration gave this residence a unique combination of a conventional 1930s Arts and Crafts interior design with an unconventional early Modernist exterior. He also had many walls and doors removed that were deemed unnecessary, and raised ceilings and added windows. The house's kitchen, with an adjoining maid's room and <b>bathroom,</b> <b>was</b> replaced with a modern kitchen. The living room was split to include a home theater and the wet bar was replaced to accommodate a film collection. After the remodel, parts of the house were featured in Ladies' Home Journal and Parents.|$|E
