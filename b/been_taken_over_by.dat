5|$|Each {{subsequent}} {{line was}} built by a different company. Rivalry often prevented any cooperation over shared facilities, and so almost every railway line into Preston used its own station. It was not until 1900 that all lines in Preston shared a single station, by which time all the companies had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>by</b> {{one or both of}} just two companies.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 {{part of the}} {{woodland}} was {{donated to}} the National Trust by the tobacco company owner George Alfred Wills. He did this to prevent housing development {{on the western side}} of the gorge as Bristol grew in size and population. In 1974 the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food bought the woodland associated with the Leigh Court estate.

No.1 AD was disbanded in December 1994, its functions having <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>by</b> other units and private contractors. At {{the time of its}} disbandment, it was the oldest RAAF unit in continuous operation.|$|E

5|$|Wotton {{station on}} the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway, which in 1923 had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>by</b> the London and North Eastern Railway, {{remained}} open (albeit little used and served by only two trains per day in each direction) until 7 December 1953, when the station was abandoned.

Only one of the crew, Victor Carroon, remains, and he has <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>by</b> an alien presence, eventually forcing Quatermass to destroy him and the other two crewmembers who have been absorbed into him in a climax set in Westminster Abbey.|$|E

To spread the revolutionary message, pemuda {{set up their}} own radio stations and newspapers, and graffiti proclaimed the nationalist sentiment. On most islands, struggle committees and militia were set up. Republican newspapers and journals were common in Jakarta, Yogyakarta, and Surakarta, which fostered a generation of writers known as angkatan 45 ('generation of 45') many of whom believed their work could be part of the revolution.|$|E

On December 25, Zhou's office ordered the Red Guards who had {{abducted}} Peng to accompany members of the PLA from Chengdu, to deliver Peng to Beijing by train (instead of by plane, because the airports in Sichuan had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>by</b> Red Guards), and then to deliver Peng to the Beijing PLA garrison. After the party arrived in Beijing, Wang Dabin successfully directed Red Guards under his command to delay the PLA unit scheduled to take possession of Peng, and succeeded in keeping Peng from being saved.|$|E
5|$|Since Humphrey (VI) {{was only}} {{sixteen years old}} at the time of his father's death, the Braose lands were taken into the king's custody until 1270. Part of this inheritance, the Marcher lordship of Brecon, was in the {{meanwhile}} given to the custody of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford. Humphrey technically regained his lordship from Clare in 1270, but by this time these lands had effectively <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>by</b> the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who had taken advantage of the previous decade's political chaos in England to extend his territory into the Marches.|$|E

5|$|Thơ's {{government}} halted Nhu's Strategic Hamlet Program. Nhu had trumpeted {{the program}} as the solution to South Vietnam's difficulties with Việt Cộng insurgents, believing that the mass relocation of peasants into fortified villages would isolate the Viet Cong from their peasant support base. Thơ contradicted Nhu's earlier reports {{on the success of}} the program, claiming that only 20% of the 8,600 existing strategic hamlets were under Saigon's control, with the rest having <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>by</b> the communists. Those hamlets that were deemed to be tenable were consolidated, while the remainder were dismantled and their inhabitants returned to their ancestral land.|$|E

In 1983, British Rail chairman Peter Parker commissioned a report into the possibility of converting Marylebone into a 'high-speed bus way', whereby Marylebone would be converted into a coach station. The tracks between Marylebone, Harrow-on-the-Hill and South Ruislip would have closed, and {{been converted into a}} road for the exclusive use of buses and coaches. British Rail services via High Wycombe would have been diverted into Paddington, and the Aylesbury services would have <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>by</b> London Underground on an extended Metropolitan line, and then routed to Baker Street.|$|E
