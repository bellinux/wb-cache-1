Wind farms employing fixed speed induction generators may require the installation of compensation devices (e. g. SVC, STATCOM, DVR, [...] .) to fulfill the network LVRT requirements. Additionally, these devices can contribute to decrease the flicker emission. In this paper, the installation of a STATCOM device in parallel with wind turbines is examined. Different configurations are analyzed through simulation with the aim of determining the STATCOM size and designing its control. Measurement data obtained in a wind park has been used in order to simulate the real working conditions of wind turbines. Objectives The main objective of this work is to analyze the capability of an STATCOM connected to LV side of a fixed speed wind turbine. This device is used to fulfill the grid code requirements related to voltage sag immunity (LVRT) and to reduce flicker emissions. The steps to achieve the above mentioned objectives are: •Modeling. Wind turbine and STATCOM are modeled in PSCAD. The wind turbine simulation results are compared with measurement in a real wind turbine installed in the Sotavento Experimental Wind Farm (www. sotaventogalicia. com). •Simulation.
