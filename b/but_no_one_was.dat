5|$|Power outages {{began in}} some neighborhoods at 6:30p.m. AST (2230 UTC) August 16, over 12hours {{before the storm}} arrived, and quickly spread over the entire island. The night saw heavy rains, 4cm (1.58inches) at Hewanorra International Airport, and intense {{thunderstorms}} and by morning hurricane-force winds peaked at 80knots (90mph, 145km/h). The winds uprooted trees, downed electricity poles, disabled bridges, triggered landslides, and damaged several roofs. Hurricane Dean tore the corrugated metal roof off Victoria Hospital's pediatric ward, but its patients had already been evacuated. St. Jude Hospital in Vieux Fort was also damaged when part of the roof blew off its medical ward and fell through {{the roof of the}} emergency room.

When the detachment arrived at Savanna they found no Native Americans, and plenty of bullet holes from the battle. The group continued to Fort Armstrong, where they picked up supplies, and returned to Galena without incident. On June 1, then-Colonel Zachary Taylor expressed his concerns about recent events, including the Plum River raid in a letter to General Henry Atkinson.

5|$|On {{the evening}} of August 16, 12hours before the storm arrived in St. Lucia, power outages began {{in some of the}} island's neighborhoods. The night saw heavy rains, 1.58in (40mm) at St. Lucia's Hewanorra International Airport, and intense {{thunderstorms}} and by morning hurricane force winds peaked at 90mph (145km/h). The winds uprooted trees, downed electricity poles, disabled bridges, triggered landslides, and damaged several roofs. Saint Lucia's capital, Castries, was flooded by the storm surge which left boulders and fishing boats on the streets. One person drowned in Sarrot after being swept away by a rain-swollen river while trying to recover a cow. Hurricane Dean damaged the roofs of two of the island's hospitals, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> injured. Several other buildings were damaged, mostly on the island's northern coast which was most exposed to the hurricane. The Ministry of Education reported that 11 schools had sustained a combined total of EC$300,000 of damage, and nationwide damage to housing and buildings totaled EC$800,000.
