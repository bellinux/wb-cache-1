5|$|When {{examining}} {{groups of}} people with obstructive sleep apnea, {{researchers have found that}} 10–20% of them meet the criteria for OHS as well. The risk of OHS is much higher in those with more severe obesity, i.e. a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher. It is twice as common in men compared to women. The average age at diagnosis is 52. American <b>Black</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> more likely to be obese than American whites, and are therefore more likely to develop OHS, but obese Asians are more likely than people of other ethnicities to have OHS at a lower BMI as a result of physical characteristics.|$|E

Sojourner announces {{that this is not}} any better for those colored people than it is for the members of her audience. She then proposes that <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> given their own land. Because a portion of the South's population contained rebels that were unhappy with the abolishment of slavery, that region of the United States was not well suited for colored people. She goes on to suggest that colored people be given land out west to build homes and prosper on.|$|E

According to Cook, the executive was given a two-hour beating and ordered to lick a bathroom floor for at least 30 minutes. She testified that Marc Yager and Guillaume Lesevre, two of Scientology's most senior executives, were pressured to state that they had had a homosexual affair and were beaten until they [...] "confessed". According to another executive, Tom De Vocht, Miscavige pushed Yager to the ground and told a black executive, [...] "By the way, [...] thinks <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> niggers, and he doesn't want Scientology to help blacks.

500|$|A {{frequently}} cited comparison {{has been to}} Tarantino's second and more successful film Pulp Fiction, especially since the majority of audiences saw Reservoir Dogs after the success of Pulp Fiction. Comparisons have been made regarding the black humor in both the films, the theme of accidents, and more concretely, the style of dialogue and narrative style that Tarantino incorporates into both films. [...] Specifically the relationship between whites and blacks plays {{a big part in}} the filmsthough underplayed in Reservoir Dogs. Stanley Crouch of The New York Times compared the way the white criminals speak of black people in Reservoir Dogs to the way they are spoken of in Scorsese's Mean Streets and Goodfellas.

500|$|Makeba {{has also}} been {{associated}} with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: [...] "Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The <b>Black</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that [...] "black is beautiful". Along with performers such as Simone, Lena Horne, and Abbey Lincoln, she used her position as a prominent musician to advocate for civil rights. Their activism has been described as simultaneously calling attention to racial and gender disparities, and highlighting [...] "that the liberation they desired could not separate race from sex". Makeba's critique of second-wave feminism as being the product of luxury led to observers being unwilling to call her a feminist. Scholar Ruth Feldstein stated that Makeba and others influenced both black feminism and second-wave feminism through their advocacy, and the historian Jacqueline Castledine referred to her as one of the [...] "most steadfast voices for social justice".|$|E

[...] Zuma's remarks came after Zille had questioned matric pass improvements in various provinces. Zille had said that the surge in the number of successful candidates in Mpumalanga and the North West was questionable and unrealistic, and had called for an independent audit of the results. Zuma, reportedly, said in response: “They’ve always said that a black person cannot pass, we’re passing now...I heard this white person saying let there be an investigation, they can’t pass like this, and I said to myself, this person still has that old mentality that <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> not intelligent, if they succeed it must be probed.” ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{professional}} {{book review}} by Maximiliano Korstanje, an economist from Argentina, posits {{a more radical}} criticism on Why Nations Fail. Far from being objective, he claims, the argument of this book is based on Ethnocentrism, or Anglocentrism—that other non-Western civilizations will converge to the universal Western ideal of development, democracy and human rights. Acemoglu and Robinson, he argues, fail {{to recognize that there}} are many other nations that are free to choose to live in another way; there is no imperative stating that all nations should be democratic to enjoy the “benefits” of modern life and a capitalist economy. Indeed, paradoxically, envisaging democracy as a [...] "universal value" [...] is a betrayal to the self-determination of others, which Korstanje sees as the very cornerstone of democratic ideology. In his view, defining a nation's success as a function of its degree of wealth or per capita income corresponds directly to an [...] "ethnocentric" [...] mechanism within the discipline, aimed at creating a need in non-western societies, namely, the [...] "need" [...] to be [...] "economically developed," [...] "modern" [...] and [...] "democratic." [...] There is no genuine attempt for a critical discussion of the role of international financial corporations like the World Bank in issuing an unlimited number of loans to the world. Lastly, Acemoglu and Robinson are not treating the problem of inequality with accuracy and detail. The Gini coefficient list shows how some Latin American countries such as Uruguay are more egalitarian than the United States. Moreover, inside the United States, despite the high level of economic development and the democratic system, <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> often excluded from such benefits, reaffirming the ethnocentric nature of democracy and development.|$|E
2500|$|On a September 2007 {{edition of}} The Radio Factor, while having a {{discussion}} about race with fellow Fox News commentator and author Juan Williams about a meal he shared with Al Sharpton, O'Reilly said [...] "You know when Sharpton and I walked in, it was like... big commotion and everything. But everybody was very nice. And I couldn't get {{over the fact that}} there was no difference between Sylvia's Restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City. I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship." [...] He commented that no one in Sylvia's [...] was [...] "screaming 'M'Fer, I want more iced tea.'" [...] He further added, [...] "I think that black Americans are starting to think more and more for themselves, getting away from the Sharptons and the Jacksons and people trying to lead them into a race-based culture. They're just trying to figure it out. 'Look, I can make it. If I work hard and get educated, I can make it.'" [...] The statement drew criticism from a number of places. Roland S. Martin of CNN said that the notion that <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> just now starting to value education is [...] "ridiculous" [...] and that the notion that black people let Sharpton or Jackson think for them is [...] "nuts". Media Matters for America covered the story on a number of occasions. O'Reilly responded, saying, [...] "It was an attempt to tell the radio audience that there is no difference—black, white, we're all Americans. The stereotypes they see on television are not true" [...] and also called out Media Matters, claiming that [...] "Media Matters distorted the entire conversation and implied I was racist for condemning racism." [...] Juan Williams said the criticism of O'Reilly was [...] "rank dishonesty" [...] and that the original comments [...] "had nothing to do with racist ranting by anybody except by these idiots at CNN." [...] Williams went on to say it was [...] "frustrating" [...] that the media try to criticize anyone who wanted to have an honest discussion about race.|$|E
