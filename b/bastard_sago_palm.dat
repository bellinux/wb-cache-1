We tested the viability of Landsat ETM+ image to locate the distribution and abundance of the <b>sago</b> <b>palm</b> in the Agusan del Sur province.

40|$|A new {{competition}} between biofuel production and food production {{has occurred in}} recent years, therefore the development of some new plant resources and their utilization are needed. <b>Sago</b> <b>palm</b> and related species that can store {{a large amount of}} starch in the trunk and can grow under severe environmental conditions are considered to be potential starch resources for not only food production but also ethanol production. However, even <b>sago</b> <b>palm,</b> an elite species among the starch producing palms, grows under semi-domesicated or natural condition and there are many problems to utilize it. Thus, the systematic, ecological, physiological, agronomic and economic studies should be carried out for improvement of these species. Here, the recent research progress is reviewed. Large variation in morphological characteristics and palm size existed among the folk varieties of <b>sago</b> <b>palm,</b> and the difference in pith dry-matter yield was mainly attributable to trunk diameter and dry-matter content of the pith. The two key parameters were closely related with soil profile indicating natural fertility. On the other hand, the genetic distance of <b>sago</b> <b>palm</b> individuals grown in the Malay Archipelago was considered to be related to geographical distribution. The genetic variation was small in the western area and large in the eastern area. <b>Sago</b> <b>palm</b> tolerated up to 171 mM (1. 0 %) NaCl concentration in the growth media for comparatively long period. The salt resistance of <b>sago</b> <b>palm</b> might be due to salt avoidance to mechanically restrict an excess of Na distribution from the roots to leaflets. The Na influx might be disturbed by the endodermal cells of roots even under 342 mM (2. 0 %) NaCl condition. <b>Sago</b> <b>palm</b> tolerated severe low pH condition such at pH 3. 6 in the growth media for 5 months at least and maintained a low Al 3 + concentration in the plant tissues. <b>Sago</b> <b>palm</b> was considered to have a high tolerance to Al with the Al exclusion ability. Moreover, the growth of <b>sago</b> <b>palm</b> was stimulated when AlCl 3 was added into the growth media with 10 ppm Al.

Its mass cultivation and commercial utilization has recently gained interest from the government in order to develop and sustain a large-scale Sago starch industry. We used the FAO EcoCrop model to predict climatically-suitable areas of <b>Sago</b> <b>palms</b> for the current and future climate scenarios. EcoCrop is a simple mechanistic model which uses climate datasets and expert-derived temperature and rainfall ranges as inputs to determine the main niche of a crop and then produces a suitability score as output. However, it requires validation to determine accuracy of its predictions. For the current climate, we utilized WorldClim version 1. 4, a dataset of global climate surfaces representative of the years 1950 to 2000. The predicted distribution for the current climate was validated using 472 random samples of confirmed <b>Sago</b> <b>palm</b> locations obtained through satellite image analysis and field surveys.

The introduction of VAM to in-vitro <b>sago</b> <b>palm</b> plantlet has not been investigated. Therefore, the main objective is to study the effectiveness of VAM on root development of <b>sago</b> <b>palm</b> plantlets.

The cultured spore was inoculated to the plantlets aged from stage three aged from zero to eight month. The result showed the highest production of spores occurred at pH 4. 2 after 21 days of inoculation to the host plant of Allium sp.

The <b>Sago</b> <b>palm</b> is well known for its rich starch contents and as a significant source of other raw materials of high economic value. The Envisat ASAR image used in the analysis was acquired on November 15, 2010 at 13 : 42 : 13 UTC in Image Mode with HH polarization. Pixels representing various land-cover classes were identified in the SAR image through the use of ground truth data from the field surveys {{and with the help of}} ALOS AVNIR- 2 image and high resolution Google Earth images. The number of pixels randomly collected for each land-cover class was limited to 500 to make a fair analysis and comparison of the backscattering coefficients.

These include the mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, standard error, and 95 % confidence interval of the mean. To evaluate how different the backscattering coefficient of <b>Sago</b> <b>palm</b> from those of other land-cover types, an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was employed.

Along with this comes the need to determine the location and distribution of these palms, and to ascertain whether there is enough supply of sago to drive and sustain a large scale sago starch industry. This situation calls for opportunities for the adoption of existing remote sensing (RS) -based techniques for mapping of the <b>sago</b> <b>palm</b> in RS images and to empirically estimate <b>sago</b> <b>palm</b> structural characteristics that could provide information on the amount of starch that could be extracted from a sago stand.

The results showed that <b>sago</b> <b>palm</b> had a comparatively high resistance to Al stress, maintaining rates of both plant length and net leaf product better than yatay palm and rattan. The macronutrients in whole plants of the three species decreased under the 200 ppm Al treatments, especially P, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +. However, some macronutrients, such as N and K+, tended to decrease or increase differently depending on the palm species and Al concentration in the growth media. In addition to the Al 3 + concentration in whole plants, {{it is likely that the}} Al resistance of yatay palm is due to its capacity as an Al-accumulator, whereas the Al resistant ability of <b>sago</b> <b>palm</b> and rattan can mainly be attributed to Al-exclusion, which <b>sago</b> <b>palm</b> has a higher Al resistance via exclusion than rattan. Moreover, Al localization of <b>sago</b> <b>palm</b> roots was observed only in the epidermal tissue layer, which would indicate that the radial transport of Al might be restricted by the development of suberin lamellae in the cell wall between the epidermis and hypodermis...|$|R
