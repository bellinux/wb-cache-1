5|$|The {{bridge is}} {{believed}} to be the first steel <b>box</b> <b>girder</b> <b>bridge</b> built in the United States, and is considered a prototype of the cable-stayed bridge of which a very similar design by the Germans was completed, the Stroemsund Bridge in Sweden. Similar bridges include a timber-stayed bridge designed in Germany in 1784, the wrought-iron stayed Albert Bridge in London designed in 1873, and the Chow Chow Bridge in Grays Harbor County. The bridge was listed on the Washington Heritage Register on January 25, 2002.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{continued}} to hamper the 9th Division's advance. The 26th Brigade, further inland, remained {{stuck on the}} eastern side of the Busu. On 10 September, the commandos providing flank security managed to get across the Sankwep River, close to its confluence with the Busu, pushing a kunda bridge across. Shortly afterwards, they clashed with a small party of Japanese attempting to advance towards the bridge, and several Japanese were killed. To reinvigorate the 26th, engineer support was brought up. The 2/7th Field Company was pushing a jeep track forward with the help of the 2/48th, and they subsequently arrived with boats, ropes and cables, and several attempts were made to get across, all of which eventually failed as the engineers came under fire from the opposite bank. Heavy clashes later took place as the Australians and Japanese fought desperately in the swamp around the crossing. As it became uncertain whether the 26th would be able to force their way across, a company from the 2/48th was sent south to use the 24th Brigade's crossing and then advance north along the western bank of the Busu to help secure the brigade's beachhead when it finally did get across. on 13 September further engineer stores arrived, including bridging equipment and folding boats, and the following day a Small <b>Box</b> <b>Girder</b> <b>bridge</b> was pushed across despite heavy fire from the opposite bank, allowing the 26th Brigade to get across the Busu on 14 September.|$|E

25|$|MD 279 {{was entirely}} reconstructed {{starting}} in the late 1950s. The highway's concrete arch bridge across Little Elk Creek was replaced with a prestressed concrete <b>box</b> <b>girder</b> <b>bridge</b> in 1958 and 1959. MD 279's present course between Little Elk Creek and Belle Hill Road was constructed and in 1959 and 1960 and surfaced with bituminous concrete in 1962. The old portion of MD 279 was replaced with a southern extension of MD 316 on Appleton Road and by MD 823 on Belle Hill Road. The highway from Belle Hill Road to the Delaware state line was reconstructed concurrent {{with the construction of}} I-95 in 1962 and 1963. Newark Avenue between MD 280 (now MD 213) and North Street was brought into the state highway system through a June 29, 1964, road transfer agreement with the county. Finally, Newark Avenue was reconstructed and the portion of MD 279 between US 40 and MD 280 was constructed between 1966 and 1968. The bypassed portion of MD 279 along North Avenue became MD 268. MD 279 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from MD 316 to the Delaware state line between 1981 and 1983. The highway's junction with I-95 was originally constructed as a diamond interchange. The junction was expanded to a cloverleaf interchange between 1984 and 1993.|$|E
500|$|The {{floating}} {{section is}} a steel <b>box</b> <b>girder</b> <b>bridge</b> with ten pontoons, which {{because of the}} fjord's depth are not laterally anchored. The roadway sits on an orthotropic deck. The pontoons and the cable-stayed bridge are built in concrete, with the main span being supported with 48 cables.

500|$|The {{technology}} for the bridge was based on recent {{technology for}} pontoon bridges combined with Norwegian offshore technology. Among the technologies initially considered, but later ruled out, was that used in the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge and the Hood Canal Bridge in the United States. Instead, an orthotropic deck was chosen, such as the Bergsøysund Bridge had used. The choice of a <b>box</b> <b>girder</b> <b>bridge</b> and the orthotropic deck were chosen because it gave the lower material use. Conventional pontoon bridges have lateral anchorage systems which fasten the bridge to the seabed. The technique had previously been used down to , but Salhusfjorden is [...] deep, making the method prohibitively expensive. The choice of a cable-stayed section allowed reduced traffic hazards in storms, a reduction in corrosion on the bridge deck, and improved passage of water beneath the bridge in support of wildlife.|$|E

40|$|A metro {{system is}} a railway {{transport}} system in an urban area with a high capacity, frequency and the grade separation from other traffic. An elevated metro system is more preferred type of metro system due to ease of construction and also it makes urban areas more accessible without any construction difficulty. An elevated metro system has two major elements pier and <b>box</b> <b>girder.</b> The present study focuses on two major elements, pier and <b>box</b> <b>girder,</b> of an elevated metro structural system. Conventionally the pier of a metro bridge is designed using a force based approach. During a seismic loading, the behaviour of a single pier elevated bridge relies mostly on the ductility and the displacement capacity. It is important to check the ductility of such single piers. Force based methods do not explicitly check the displacement capacity during the design. The codes are now moving towards a performance-based (displacement-based) design approach, which consider the design as per the target performances at the design stage. Performance of a pier designed by a Direct Displacement Based Design is {{compared with that of}} a force-based designed one. The design of the pier is done by both force based seismic design method and direct displacement based seismic design method {{in the first part of}} the study. In the second part, a parametric study on behaviour of <b>box</b> <b>girder</b> <b>bridges</b> is carried out by using finite element method. The finite element model is validated with model of Gupta et al. (2010). The parameters considered to present the behaviour of Single Cell <b>Box</b> <b>Girder,</b> Double Cell <b>Box</b> <b>Girder</b> and Triple Cell <b>Box</b> <b>Girder</b> <b>bridges</b> are radius of curvature, span length and span length to the radius of curvature ratio.

This paper is also intended to show the adopted structural trends by presenting existing extradosed bridges, bridges under construction, and newly designed bridges.

Compared to bending theory predictions. the shear lag causes a Significant increase in the maximum longitudinal normal stress, alters the stress redistributions due to a change in the structural system during the construction stage, and substantially increases the deflections. The statistical variability of material creep parameters and environmental factors has a sig-nificanl effecl on Ihe slatistical scalier of Ihe calculilled maximum I'>nsitudinal stresses and a very large effecl on Ihe slatistical scalier of the predicted de-flections.
