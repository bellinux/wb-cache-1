5|$|In the Northern Hemisphere, {{this bird}} breeds from April to August. In east Africa, the <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> {{is at least}} from January to February, while in {{southern}} Africa, the <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> is from October to April.|$|E
5|$|The <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> for the Central American {{squirrel}} monkey is in September. All females come into estrus at {{virtually the same}} time. A month or two before the <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> begins, males become larger. This is not due to extra muscle, but to altered water balance within the male's body. This is caused by conversion of the male hormone testosterone into estrogen; thus the more testosterone a male produces, the more he grows {{in advance of the}} <b>breeding</b> <b>season.</b> Since males within a group have not been observed fighting over access to females during <b>breeding</b> <b>season,</b> nor attempting to force females to copulate with them, it is believed that female choice determines which males get to breed with females. Females tend to prefer the males that expand the most in advance of <b>breeding</b> <b>season.</b> This may be because the most enlarged males are generally the oldest and the most effective at detecting predators, or it may be a case of runaway intersexual selection.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} nests in colonies, which are often, but not always, found around bodies of water. The colonies are usually found in {{woodlands}} near lakes or rivers, in swamps, or on small inland or coastal islands, and are sometimes shared with other wetland birds, such as herons, egrets, ibises and cormorants. The <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> varies within South Asia. Nesting in northern India {{begins with the}} onset of monsoons in May. The <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> in Australia is November to early January, with one brood laid per season. The North American <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> lasts from April to October. In the Seychelles, the <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> of the subspecies B.i. seychellarum is April to October.|$|E

5|$|This bird is monogamous, forming {{long lasting}} pair bonds, with pairs of grey-necked wood rails staying {{together}} throughout the year. Its <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> usually occurs between March and August, although this {{varies depending on}} geography. In Costa Rica, the <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> extends until September. In Mexico, on the other hand, the <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> is known to start as early as January. In captivity, this wood rail is territorial.|$|E

5|$|During the <b>breeding</b> <b>season,</b> the American white ibis gathers in huge colonies near water. Pairs are {{predominantly}} monogamous and both parents {{care for the}} young, although males tend to engage in extra-pair copulation with other females to increase their reproductive success. Males have also been found to pirate food from unmated females and juveniles during the <b>breeding</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E

5|$|House sparrows can {{breed in}} the <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> {{immediately}} following their hatching, and sometimes {{attempt to do}} so. Some birds breeding {{for the first time}} in tropical areas are only a few months old and still have juvenile plumage. Birds breeding for the first time are rarely successful in raising young, and reproductive success increases with age, as older birds breed earlier in the <b>breeding</b> <b>season,</b> and fledge more young. As the <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> approaches, hormone releases trigger enormous increases in the size of the sexual organs and changes in day length lead males to start calling by nesting sites. The timing of mating and egg-laying varies geographically, and between specific locations and years because a sufficient supply of insects is needed for egg formation and feeding nestlings.|$|E
5|$|Mockingbird nests {{are also}} often parasitized by cowbirds. The parents {{are found to}} reject {{parasitic}} eggs at an intermediate rate. A recent study has shown that foreign eggs {{are more likely to}} be rejected from a nest later in the <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> than from earlier in a <b>breeding</b> <b>season.</b> Early nesting hosts may not have learned the pattern and coloration of their first clutch yet, so are less likely to reject foreign eggs. There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between the breeding seasons of the northern mockingbirds and their parasites. If the <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> of the parasites starts later, there is less likelihood of parasitism. Hence, it pays the hosts to have relatively lower sensitivity to parasitic eggs.|$|E
5|$|Nestlings, fledglings, and juveniles have brown plumage and pink-brown {{bills with}} shorter tails than adults. Young males develop blue tail {{feathers}} and darker bills by late summer or autumn (following a spring or summer <b>breeding</b> <b>season),</b> while young females develop light blue tails. By the subsequent spring, all males are fertile and have developed cloacal protuberances, which store sperm. In contrast, during the <b>breeding</b> <b>season,</b> fertile females develop oedematous brood patches, which are bare areas on their bellies.|$|E

50|$|Orthogeomys are solitary creatures {{except during}} their <b>breeding</b> <b>seasons.</b> In the <b>breeding</b> <b>seasons</b> though, {{multiple}} individuals can occupy the same burrow. During the non-breeding times of year, only one Ortheogeomys occupies a tunnel system {{at a given}} time. These tunnels are subdivided into areas for their nest, the food store, and a separate tunnel for excrement. In the O. cherriei, tunnels have an average height of 12.8 cm, and can be up to almost 200 m in length. Orthogeomys are primarily active during the morning and afternoon, and are mainly found inside their burrows.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This review {{examines}} how birds use the annual cycle in photoperiod {{to ensure that}} seasonal events—breeding, molt, and song production—happen {{at the appropriate time}} of year. Differences in breeding strategies between birds and mammals reflect basic differences in biology. Avian <b>breeding</b> <b>seasons</b> tend to be of shorter duration and more asymmetric with respect to changes in photo-period. <b>Breeding</b> <b>seasons</b> can occur at the same time each year (predictable) or at different times (opportunistic), depending on the food resource. In all cases, there is evidence for involvement of photoperiodic control, nonphotoperiodic control, and endogenous circannual rhythmicity. In predictable breeders (most nontropical species), photoperiod is the predominant proximate factor. Increasing photoperiods of spring stimulate secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and consequent gonadal maturation. However, breeding ends before the return of short photoperiods. This is the consequence of a second effect of long photoperiods—the induction of photorefractoriness. This dual role of long photoperiods is required to impart the asymmetry in <b>breeding</b> <b>seasons...</b>|$|R
5|$|Outside its <b>breeding</b> <b>season,</b> the russet sparrow is gregarious {{and forms}} flocks to find food, though it {{infrequently}} associates with other birds. Wintering flocks tend {{to keep away}} from human habitation. The russet sparrow is also social at night during the winter, and it forms large communal roosts in trees and bushes. In the <b>breeding</b> <b>season,</b> the female roosts in the nests and the male nests in foliage nearby.|$|E
5|$|The <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> is in spring. During the {{beginning}} of the <b>breeding</b> <b>season,</b> courting pairs soar high together and one or both may make steep spiralling or swooping dives. The birds are monogamous and pair bonds may be maintained for more than one <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> and the same nest sites may be reused each year. The nest is an untidy platform of twigs lined with rags and placed on a cliff ledge, building, or the fork of a large tree. Old nest platforms of eagles may also be taken over. Nests placed on the ground are rare but have been recorded in subspecies N. p. ginginianus and N. p. majorensis.|$|E

40|$|Female {{aggregation}} {{and male}} territoriality {{are considered to}} be hallmarks of polygynous mating systems. The development of genetic parentage assignment has called into question the accuracy of behavioral traits in predicting true mating systems. In this study we use 14 microsatellite markers to explore the mating system {{of one of the most}} behaviorally polygynous species, the California sea lion (Zalophus californianus). We sampled a total of 158 female-pup pairs and 99 territorial males across two breeding rookeries (San Jorge and Los Islotes) in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Fathers could be identified for 30 % of pups sampled at San Jorge across three <b>breeding</b> <b>seasons</b> and 15 % of sampled pups at Los Islotes across two <b>breeding</b> <b>seasons.</b> Analysis of paternal relatedness between the pups for which no fathers were identified (sampled over four <b>breeding</b> <b>seasons</b> at San Jorge and two at Los Islotes) revealed that few pups were likely to share a father [...] ...|$|R

5|$|In the wild, the <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> for Campbell's dwarf hamster {{varies by}} location. For example, the <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> begins towards {{the middle of}} April in Tuva and {{towards the end of}} April in Mongolia. However, in captivity, there is no fixed <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> and they can breed {{frequently}} throughout the year. Females are usually sexually mature at two months of age and the gestation period is typically 20 days. Campbell's dwarf hamster is crepuscular, along with all species of Phodopus and is active throughout the year. Campbell's dwarf hamsters are omnivores, and so feed on both plant and insect material. Campbell's dwarf hamster inhabits burrows with four to six horizontal and vertical tunnels in the steppes and semi deserts of central Asia, the Altai mountains, autonomous areas of Tuva and the Hebei province in northeastern China.|$|E

5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater breeds in monogamous pairs in a <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> {{that extends}} from July to March, with {{migrating}} birds nesting later than sedentary birds. They nest solitarily in all-purpose territories that both parents defend against conspecifics {{and other species}} including thornbills, spinebills, and silvereyes, although the male is involved in more aggressive interactions than the female. Within a <b>breeding</b> <b>season</b> females lay two or three clutches of eggs, re-nesting with the same partner in the same territory. Banded birds {{have been identified in}} the same territory for periods of up to five years.|$|E

5|$|Waxwings are {{primarily}} fruit eaters, but also consume insects during the <b>breeding</b> <b>season.</b> Mosquitoes and midges {{are the most}} common prey, but many other insects and some spiders are eaten. They are caught mainly by flycatching from an open perch, but some may be picked off vegetation. Fruit is normally picked from trees, sometimes from the ground, and is usually swallowed whole. In the summer, Vaccinium and Rubus species and Canada buffaloberry are important items of their diet, while cotoneaster, juniper, haws, rose hips and apples predominate outside the <b>breeding</b> <b>season.</b> Rowan berries are a favourite food, and are eaten whenever available.|$|E
