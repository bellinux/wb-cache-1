5000|$|There are {{a number}} of ligands {{selective}} for the D1 receptors. To date, most of the known ligands are based on dihydrexidine or the prototypical benzazepine partial agonist SKF-38393 (one derivative being the prototypical antagonist SCH-23390). [...] D1 receptor has a high degree of structural homology to another dopamine receptor, D5, and they both bind similar drugs. As a result, none of the known orthosteric ligands is selective for the D1 vs. the D5 receptor, but the <b>benzazepines</b> generally are more selective for the D1 and D5 receptors versus the D2-like family.

50|$|The {{reaction}} {{depicted in}} Scheme 2 illustrates the Povarov reaction with an imine and an enamine {{in the presence}} of yttrium triflate as the lewis acid. This reaction is regioselective because the iminium ion preverentially attacks the nitro ortho position and not the para position. The nitro group is a meta directing substituent but since this position is blocked, the most electron rich ring position is now ortho and not para. The reaction is also diastereoselective because the enamine addition occurs with a preference for trans addition without formation of the cis isomer. In 2013, Doyle and coworkers reported a Povarov-type, formal 4+2-cycloaddition reaction between donor-acceptor cyclopropenes and imines (Scheme 3). In the first step, a dirhodium catalyst effects diazo decomposition from silyl enol ether diazo compound to yield a donor/acceptor cyclopropene. The donor/acceptor cyclopropene is then reacted with an aryl imine under scandium(III) triflate catalyzed conditions to yield cyclopropane-fused tetrahydroquinolines in good yields and diastereoselectivities. Treatment of these compounds with TBAF invokes a ring-expansion that provides the corresponding <b>benzazepines.</b>|$|E

In vitro and in vivo binding studies inrats showed that [1251]NNC 13 - 8241 binds to BZ receptorswith high affinity and low degree of non-specific binding.

The stereochemistry of these adducts was determine by chemical correlation with known p-amino sulfoxides. Chapter 2 is an extension of this method and describes the addition of lithiated methyl phenyl sulfoxide to oxaziridines. The relative stereochemistry of the major and minor adducts from these reactions was determined by 1 H NMR spectroscopic analysis. A new method for the synthesis of oxaziridines by the oxidation of imines with Oxone® is also reported. In Chapter 3, an attempt was made to extend this methodology to the synthesis of β-amino sulfoxide (7), from the addition of methyl phenyl sulfoxide to nitrile oxides, benzohydroximinoyl chlorides and nitriles, and then reduction of the products by either sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride.

Therefore, organic chemists have been making extensive efforts to produce these heterocyclic compounds by developing new and efficient synthetic transformations. Benzofused cyclic molecules incorporating at least one nitrogen atom in the structure are {{often referred to as}} “privileged structures” owing to their capability of binding to multiple receptors with high affinity. 1 Benzofused seven- or eight membered cyclic amines, named as <b>benzazepines</b> or benzazocines respectively, exhibit important pharmacological properties and are currently under intense scrutiny for their physiological activity. For example, 1 -benzazepine systems 2 have shown significant antimicrobial and analgesic activity. 2 -Benzazepines have been reported 3 to be used as non peptide mimics for the well known tri-peptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), which interacts with αvβ 3 integrin, a pivotal protein that {{plays a key role in}} cell-cell signaling and acts as its antagonist. 3 -Benzazepines have inhibitory effect on reverse transcriptase. 4 1 -Benzazocine derivatives are described as CCR- 5 antagonists and used against HIV infections and some other diseases also. 5 These cyclic amine moieties are present in many pharmaceutically active naturally occurring molecules, for example: i) Galanthamine (1) 6 isolated from Galanthus woronowii or Galanthus nivalis is one of the effective drugs for Alzheimer disease, the most common case of elderly dementia; ii) (+) –FR 900482 (2) 7 isolated from Streptomyces sandaensis and acts as an anti-tumor antibiotic;. iii) (-) Pancracine (3) 8 isolated from Rhodophiala bifida of USA shows hypotensive and anticonvulsive activities. Besides lennoxamine (4), 9 cephalotaxine (5), 10 buflavine (6), 11 lycoramine (7), 12 chilenine (8), 13 and montanine (9) 14 are notable for their unique and synthetically challenging structures...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{polyamine}} {{transport system}} (PTS) whose activity is up-regulated in cancer cells {{is an attractive}} target for drug design. Two heterocyclic (azepine and <b>benzazepine)</b> systems were conjugated to various polyamine moieties through an amidine bound to afford 18 compounds which were evaluated for their affinity for the PTS {{and their ability to}} use the PTS for cell delivery. Structure-activity relationship studies and lead optimization afforded two attractive PTS targeting compounds. The azepine-spermidine conjugate 14 is a very selective substrate of the PTS that may serve as a vector for radioelements used for diagnoses or therapeutics in nuclear medicine. The nitrobenzazepine-spermine conjugate 28 is a very powerful PTS inhibitor with very low intrinsic cytotoxicity, able to prevent the growth of polyamine depleted cells in presence of exogenous polyamines...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of dopamine D 5 receptor {{was investigated in}} peripheral blood lymphocytes of 11 migraine patients and of ten healthy control subjects using a radioligand binding technique with [3 H]SCH 23390 as a ligand. [3 H]SCH 23390 is a <b>benzazepine</b> derivative with potent antagonist properties at the dopamine D 1 -like receptors. [3 H]SCH 23390 was specifically bound to peripheral blood lymphocytes of migraineurs and control subjects {{in a manner consistent}} with the labelling of a dopamine D 5 receptor. In migraineurs a statistically significant higher density of lymphocyte dopamine D 5 receptor compared with controls was noticeable, whereas the affinity of the radioligand was unchanged. The increased density of dopamine D 5 receptor in peripheral blood lymphocytes may reflect the dopaminergic hypersensitivity displayed by migraineurs and may represent a relatively simple and reliable peripheral marker of altered dopaminergic function...|$|R
40|$|Alkaloid {{molecules}} can act, {{depending on}} {{a type of}} amine functionality present in alkalods, as either hydrogen-acceptor or hydrogen-donor for hydrogen bonding that is critically important for the interaction (binding) between targets (enzymes, proteins and receptors) and drugs (ligands). Because of this unique property, alkaloid scaffolds are therefore present in several drugs and lead compounds. This review highlights alkaloid scaffolds in drugs, particularly those recently approved in 2012; it also covers the scaffolds in leads and drug candidates which are in clinical trials and preclinical pipeline. The review focuses on three therapeutic areas including treatments of cancer, tuberculosis, and tobacco cessation. Alkaloid scaffolds in drugs and leads are inspired by those of naturally occurring alkaloids, and these scaffolds include pyridine, piperidine, quinoline, quinolinone, quinazoline, isoquinoline, indole, indolinone, isoindole, isoxazole, imidazole, indazole, thiazole, pyrazole, oxazolidinone, oxadiazole, and <b>benzazepine.</b> In addition to medicinal chemistry aspects, natural products possessing an individual alkaloid scaffold, {{as well as the}} mechanism of action of drugs and leads, are also discussed in this review...|$|R
