6000|$|But now please {{observe how}} [...] "the whirligig of time brings its revenges." [...] This latest {{discovery}} of the remedial virtue of a very, very tiny hair of the dog that bit you reminds us, not only of Arndt's law of protoplasmic reaction to stimuli, according to which weak and strong stimuli provoke opposite reactions, but of Hahnemann's homeopathy, which was founded on the fact alleged by Hahnemann that drugs which produce certain symptoms when taken in ordinary perceptible quantities, will, when taken in infinitesimally small quantities, provoke just the opposite symptoms; so that the drug {{that gives you a}} headache will also cure a headache if you take little enough of it. I have already explained that the savage opposition which homeopathy encountered from the medical profession was not a scientific opposition; for nobody seems to deny that some drugs act in the alleged manner. It was opposed simply because doctors and apothecaries lived by selling bottles and boxes of doctor's stuff to be taken in spoonfuls or in pellets as large as peas; and people would not pay as much for drops and globules no bigger than pins' heads. Nowadays, however, the more cultivated folk are beginning to be so suspicious of drugs, and the incorrigibly superstitious people so profusely supplied with patent medicines (the medical advice to take them being wrapped round the bottle and thrown in for nothing) that homeopathy has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> rehabilitating the trade of prescription compounding, and is consequently coming into professional credit. At which point the theory of opsonins comes very opportunely to shake hands with it.|$|E

50|$|Industry convergence: As {{industries}} converge and {{the traditional}} lines between different industrial sectors blur, strategic alliances are sometimes {{the only way to}} develop the complex skills necessary in the time frame required.

50|$|Corruption {{within the}} BMA and in post-war Malay society was wide spread.. Pre-War British colonial administrations adhered to a strict code of behaviour, and thus {{corruption}} had been virtually absent.

5000|$|Some Germans were {{convinced}} that it was their duty to apply all possible expedients {{to end the war}} as quickly as possible. Sabotage efforts were undertaken by members of the Abwehr (military intelligence) leadership, as they recruited people known to oppose the Nazi regime.

5000|$|The Third Age {{is the age}} of travelling. The magicians left a {{very bad}} memory, so they are hated {{and most of them}} hide their skills.

Everybody knows that he can go to another dream just by wandering, without any chance to come back, so the travel has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> living for most humans.

50|$|However, {{with the}} onset of globalized {{industry}} and Mexico's transition from an agricultural economy to one revolving around services and manufacturing, the ideas about women and work have been shifting dramatically. Women now see a way that they can participate in the market economy to make extra money for their families, and still are able to maintain the additional work they do at home which has no monetary value. As men are migrating for other, mostly industrial, work opportunities and agrarian work is decreasing, women have come to dominate the textile industry, which caters mainly to tourists. Weaving and factory life has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life for many Zapotec women in Oaxaca.|$|E
