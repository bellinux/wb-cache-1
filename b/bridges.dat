5|$|Covered <b>Bridges</b> Today is a non-fiction {{book on the}} {{architecture}} of covered <b>bridges</b> in the United States. The book was written by Brenda Krekeler and published by Daring Books in 1989. Covered <b>Bridges</b> Today is a frequently cited source {{on the topic of}} covered <b>bridges</b> and serves as a record of numerous covered <b>bridges</b> that have since been dismantled or demolished since the book's publication. Krekeler's text includes 412 covered <b>bridges</b> in fourteen states with a complete record of all 142 covered <b>bridges</b> in Ohio during its writing in 1986 and 1987. The work has been utilized in numerous citations by later publications including Historic American Engineering Record surveys and New England's Covered Bridges: A Complete Guide, Indiana Covered <b>Bridges</b> and Covered <b>Bridges</b> in Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Covered <b>Bridges</b> Today {{provides}} information on 412 <b>bridges</b> in the states of Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. The book is geographically focused on Krekeler's home state of Ohio and includes all 142 remaining covered <b>bridges</b> in the state {{at the time of}} writing. However, the book is not a complete inventory of each state's extant <b>bridges.</b> When it was written, 76 of an estimated 228 Pennsylvania's <b>bridges</b> were included, 68 of Indiana's 98 covered <b>bridges,</b> and 43 of Vermont's estimated 100 <b>bridges</b> were also featured. Krekeler's use of estimations stems from the facts that covered <b>bridges</b> are lost periodically and that the <b>bridges</b> detailed include those restored or in immediate danger of collapse. Within a year of the publication of the book, 30 <b>bridges</b> were lost. Known <b>bridges</b> in states that are not in the listing are not named or cited. For example, West Virginia had 17 remaining <b>bridges</b> at time of publication, but the book only covers 10 of them.|$|E
5|$|From Han {{literary}} sources, it {{is known}} that wooden-trestle beam <b>bridges,</b> arch <b>bridges,</b> simple suspension <b>bridges,</b> and floating pontoon <b>bridges</b> existed in Han China. However, there are only two known references to arch <b>bridges</b> in Han literature, and only a single Han relief sculpture in Sichuan depicts an arch bridge.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{passages}} were cleared, engineers had to construct ten heavy <b>bridges</b> (using MTU bridgelayers, TMM bridgelayers and pontoon <b>bridges),</b> five light <b>bridges,</b> ten pontoon <b>bridges</b> and 35 ferries. The passages {{had to be}} opened in five to seven hours, immediately followed by the ferries, then the <b>bridges</b> two hours later, all the while under enemy fire. Of the heavy <b>bridges,</b> the Egyptians had only two Soviet-made PMP heavy folding <b>bridges,</b> which could be erected in a shorter time than most other <b>bridges</b> in their inventory, saving a few critical hours. These <b>bridges</b> were also much easier to repair. The speed with which the engineers cleared {{the passages}} and laid the <b>bridges</b> and ferries would affect {{the course of the}} entire operation. Engineers also had to man the boats that would cross the assault infantry initially. Finally, they had to breach the minefields around Israeli defenses for the assault infantry.|$|E
5|$|Air strikes {{continued}} {{throughout the}} day, and Southern Command received optimistic reports {{during the afternoon}} from the IAF, which claimed seven <b>bridges</b> knocked out of action, with the remaining ones to be destroyed by evening. In fact, several of the <b>bridges</b> that had been destroyed were decoys. The real <b>bridges</b> meanwhile, had their damaged sections quickly repaired and returned to service. Ten heavy <b>bridges</b> had been laid during the crossing (two <b>bridges</b> in the south were laid but not operational). Now, on October 7, five of these <b>bridges</b> were removed and placed with the two already in reserve, leaving each division with one heavy bridge and one light bridge.|$|E
5|$|Although {{no part of}} the Chesham branch was in Greater London, the Greater London Council, as one of {{its last}} acts, granted £1,180,000 to replace the <b>bridges.</b> New <b>bridges</b> were built {{alongside}} the existing <b>bridges</b> to minimise disruption, and were rolled into place on 24 March 1986 and 14 April 1986.|$|E

25|$|The 1920s and 1930s were a {{relatively}} busy period for Steinman. His firm {{was involved in}} many significant projects including the Hercilio Luz <b>Bridge</b> (or Florianópolis <b>Bridge,</b> 1926), the Carquinez Strait <b>Bridge</b> (1927, {{at the time the}} second largest cantilever <b>bridge</b> in the US), the Mount Hope <b>Bridge</b> and Grand Mère Suspension <b>Bridge</b> (both 1929), the St. Johns <b>Bridge</b> and Waldo-Hancock <b>Bridge</b> (both 1931), the Sky Ride (1933 passenger transporter <b>bridge</b> at the Chicago Century of Progress exposition), the Henry Hudson <b>Bridge</b> (1936, particularly gratifying as this <b>bridge</b> realised his PhD thesis proposal), the Wellesley and Hill Islands <b>Bridge,</b> Wellesley Island Suspension <b>Bridge</b> and Georgina Island <b>Bridge</b> (all 1938 and part of the Thousand Islands <b>Bridge</b> System), the Deer Isle <b>Bridge</b> and the Sullivan-Hutsonville <b>Bridge</b> (both 1939).|$|R
5|$|Attacks {{against the}} Han River pontoon <b>bridges</b> at Seoul {{do not seem}} to have been {{successful}} until FEAF ordered the Bomber Command to lay delayed action bombs alongside the <b>bridges</b> on August 27, set to detonate at night. This method of attack seems to have caused such heavy casualties among the North Korean labor force trying to keep the pontoons in repair that they finally abandoned the effort. These <b>bridges</b> remained unfinished when the UN forces recaptured Seoul later in the year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bridges</b> over {{waterways}} {{had been}} known in China since the ancient Zhou dynasty. During the Song dynasty, large trestle <b>bridges</b> were constructed, such as that built by Zhang Zhongyan in 1158. There were also large <b>bridges</b> made entirely of stone, like the Ba Zi Bridge of Shaoxing, built in 1256 and still standing today. <b>Bridges</b> with pavilions crowning their central spans were often featured in such paintings as the landscapes of Xia Gui (1195–1224). Long, covered corridor <b>bridges,</b> like the 12th-century Rainbow Bridge in Wuyuan, Jiangxi province, which has wide stone-based piers and a wooden superstructure, were also built.|$|E
5|$|Bénouville was the {{farthest}} forward {{point of the}} British advance on 6 June 1944. On 9 June, the German Air Force attacked the <b>bridges</b> with 13 aircraft. The British had positioned light and medium-sized anti-aircraft guns around the <b>bridges</b> and {{in the face of}} intense anti-aircraft fire the attack failed, although they did claim one of the <b>bridges</b> was destroyed by a direct hit.|$|E

5|$|In {{the city}} of Zarqa, several <b>bridges,</b> {{vehicular}} and pedestrian, cross the river. The earliest of these was built by the Chechen founders of the city. Current <b>bridges</b> include the Zawahreh Bridge, a vehicular bridge connecting Baha' al-Din Street with al-Zuhur Street and another connecting Baha' al-Din Street with King Talal Street. Two pedestrian <b>bridges</b> connect al-Zuhur Street and Baha' al-Din Street, and Wasfi al-Tal Street and Petra Street.|$|E
5|$|MD32 was reconstructed and widened from Sykesville to Eldersburg {{starting}} in 1957 and from West Friendship to {{just south of}} Sykesville in 1958. The state highway's bypass of Sykesville was completed in 1963; the old road {{through the center of}} Sykesville became MD851. MD32's new bridge across the Patapsco River was the longest of only three aluminum triangular box beam girder <b>bridges</b> constructed in the United States. The girder system was topped by a concrete slab deck and underlain with standard concrete abutments and piers and steel bearing pads on which the aluminum girders rested. These <b>bridges,</b> which were designed by Fairchild Engine and Airplane Company, were constructed of aluminum due to that metal's light weight but similar strength compared to steel. Many experimental aluminum <b>bridges</b> were built due to a severe shortage of steel in the early 1960s. Aluminum <b>bridges</b> are rarely constructed because they are much more expensive than steel and concrete <b>bridges.</b>|$|E

25|$|Upon its {{completion}} in 1973, the Bosphorus <b>Bridge</b> had the fourth-longest suspension <b>bridge</b> span in the world, and the longest outside the United States (only the Verrazano-Narrows <b>Bridge,</b> Golden Gate <b>Bridge</b> and Mackinac <b>Bridge</b> had a longer span in 1973). The Bosphorus <b>Bridge</b> remained the longest suspension <b>bridge</b> in Europe until {{the completion of}} the Humber <b>Bridge</b> in 1981, and the longest suspension <b>bridge</b> in Asia until {{the completion of the}} Fatih Sultan Mehmet <b>Bridge</b> (Second Bosphorus <b>Bridge)</b> in 1988 (which was surpassed by the Minami Bisan-Seto <b>Bridge</b> in 1989).

5|$|Many bridge {{designs were}} used for roads over the highway, {{including}} the concrete arch bridge, the through plate girder bridge and the concrete T-beam bridge. <b>Bridges</b> used to carry the turnpike over other roads and streams included a concrete arch viaduct in New Stanton. At , the New Stanton viaduct was the longest bridge along the original section of the turnpike. Other turnpike <b>bridges</b> included plate girder <b>bridges</b> like the bridge over Dunnings Creek in the Bedford Narrows. Smaller concrete T-beam <b>bridges</b> were also built; a total of 307 <b>bridges</b> were constructed along the original section of the turnpike.|$|E
5|$|Most of the <b>bridges</b> which {{cross the}} river are movable, to allow {{shipping}} to pass. There are six swing bridges; four bascule <b>bridges,</b> {{two of which}} have twin leaves, one for each carriageway of the roads which they carry; and three Scherzer lift <b>bridges,</b> which are a type of rolling bascule bridge. Scott Street Bridge, which is now permanently raised, was originally powered from a high pressure water main maintained by the first public power distribution company in the world.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>bridges</b> {{have also}} been built over Little Fishing Creek. A steel truss bridge was built over it in 1896. A bridge {{carrying}} Pennsylvania Route 254 over the creek was built in 1930 and a bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 42 over the creek was built in 1939, as was one other bridge. Five other <b>bridges</b> {{were built in the}} 1940s and 1950s, including another bridge built in 1955 and carrying Pennsylvania Route 42. Several more <b>bridges</b> were built in the 1960s. The newest <b>bridges</b> over the creek were constructed in 1974, 1990, and 2009.|$|E
