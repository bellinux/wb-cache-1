[...] (2010) and music by David Guetta for its dance themes. In the introduction Roberts sings [...] "Could it be my lucky day?"; the track continues with [...] "Just light the first spark, {{and watch the}} fireworks explode. Boom, Boom, Baby", {{in what has been}} described by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy as a [...] "60s-swing-meets-East-London vibe". Roberts' voice has been described by Katherine St Asaph of Pop Dust as a [...] "springy" [...] vibrato, with breathy background vocals featuring sounds effect including repeated kissing noises. Roberts sings about falling in love with someone, as she sings: [...] "Aah, say that you love me, say that you need me too... best you ever had. It could <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy,</b> for you to please me, baby. So how come you tease me?". Roberts discussed the track on her blog, commenting that its lyrical content alludes to a boy that initially does not share the same feelings as his partner, [...] "but in the end you win him over and it's your lucky day. You can take it however you want though, maybe you won on the scratch cards and so you had a lucky day, that kind of thing". Roberts described it as a [...] "romantic reference" [...] with a [...] "down-beat track underneath", and in contrast called the top-line of the track [...] "quite cute and girly". A remix of the song was producer by band White Lies, and debuted on The Guardian. The 90s-themed concept incorporates house music, with [...] "chunky" [...] beats and [...] "twinkly" [...] synths to the original instrumental of the song.|$|E

His {{numerous}} hit songs include [...] "Night and Day", [...] "Begin the Beguine", [...] "I Get a Kick Out of You", [...] "Well, Did You Evah!", [...] "I've Got You Under My Skin", [...] "My Heart Belongs to Daddy" [...] and [...] "You're the Top". He also composed {{scores for}} films from the 1930s to the 1950s, including Born to Dance (1936), which featured the song [...] "You'd <b>Be</b> <b>So</b> <b>Easy</b> to Love"; Rosalie (1937), which featured [...] "In the Still of the Night"; High Society (1956), which included [...] "True Love"; and Les Girls (1957).|$|E
2500|$|Porter {{also wrote}} for Hollywood in the mid-1930s. His scores include {{those for the}} Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Born to Dance (1936), with James Stewart, {{featuring}} [...] "You'd <b>Be</b> <b>So</b> <b>Easy</b> to Love" [...] and [...] "I've Got You Under My Skin", and Rosalie (1937), featuring [...] "In the Still of the Night". [...] He wrote the score of the short film Paree, Paree, in 1935, {{using some of the}} songs from Fifty Million Frenchmen. Porter also composed the cowboy song [...] "Don't Fence Me In" [...] for Adios, Argentina, an unproduced movie, in 1934, but it did not become a hit until Roy Rogers sang it in the 1944 film Hollywood Canteen. Bing Crosby, The Andrews Sisters, and other artists also popularized it in the 1940s. The Porters moved to Hollywood in December 1935, but Porter's wife did not like the movie environment, and Porter's homosexual peccadillos, formerly very discreet, became less so; she retreated to their Paris house. When his film assignment on Rosalie was finished in 1937, Porter hastened to Paris to make his peace with Linda, but she remained cool. After a walking tour of Europe with his friends, Porter returned to New York in October 1937 without her. They were soon reunited by an accident suffered by Porter.|$|E
