5|$|The High Court {{agreed with}} the {{plaintiff}} that since the PSA had authority {{to decide how to}} allocate <b>berths,</b> it was also entrusted with the duty to exercise that discretion after taking various key factors into consideration, and would have acted unlawfully if it had abrogated its responsibility by taking orders from other public authorities such as the Gambling Suppression Branch or the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board unless it was under a statutory duty to do so.

40|$|A ship <b>berthing</b> plan assigns surface vessels a <b>berth</b> {{prior to}} their port entrance, or reassigns ships once in port {{to allow them to}} {{accomplish}} in a timely manner maintenance, training, and certification events which build readiness for future operational commitments. Each ship requires different services when in port, such as shore power, crane services, ordnance, and fuel. Unfortunately, not all services are offered at all piers. At present, ship <b>berthing</b> plans are manually prepared by a port operations scheduler and often result in unnecessary <b>berth</b> shifts, which puts ships out of action for several hours. An extensive user-friendly computerized optimization model is developed and tested to assist the schedulers in the creation of <b>berthing</b> plan which minimizes port loading conflicts, thus promoting fleet readiness through <b>berthing</b> stability.

40|$|<b>Berth</b> {{management}} in container terminal: the template design problem © Springer-Verlag 2006 Abstract One {{of the foremost}} planning problems in container transshipment operation concerns the allocation of home <b>berth</b> (preferred <b>berthing</b> location) {{to a set of}} vessels scheduled to call at the terminal on a weekly basis. The home <b>berth</b> location is subsequently used as a key input to yard storage, personnel, and equipment deployment planning. For instance, the yard planners use the home <b>berth</b> template to plan for the storage locations of transshipment containers within the terminal. These decisions (yard storage plan) are in turn used as inputs in actual <b>berthing</b> operations, when the vessels call at the terminal. In this paper, we study the economical impact of the home <b>berth</b> template design problem on container terminal operations. In particular, we show that it involves a delicate trade-off between the service (waiting time for vessels) and cost (movement of containers between <b>berth</b> and yard) dimension of operations in the terminal. The problem i...|$|R
