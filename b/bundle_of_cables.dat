40|$|As is {{the case}} with many other {{manufacturers}} of vehicles, Volvo Construction Equipment has a constantly increasing amount of electric and electronic equipment in their articulated haulers. These are of great use in modern machines, bringing functions, and safety that were not possible before, but they also bring more cables to handle. In the case of the articulated haulers a quite thick cable harness of about 15 meters in length reaches from the driver’s cabin in the front to the components in the far back end of the vehicle. This is not only a lot of long cables to handle both during assembly and service, but the nature of signals traveling in cables is that the voltage gets weaker with distance. This phenomenon has to be accounted for by measuring devices dependent on the voltage. It has been suggested that a device referred to as an intelligent node, or ICCS-module, which communicates digitally via CAN could be installed {{in the back of the}} articulated haulers. This module would be independent of the mentioned drop in voltage. The ICCS-module will be receiving a small <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> being routed from the driver’s cabin. From it cables would go out to a majority of the components in its vicinity. The components connected to the node would not need to have any other cables. This thesis is focused on the mechanical aspects of installing this ICCS-module. Having electric and electronic equipment on construction vehicles is a challenge when it comes to protecting the device from the harsh environment that is the hauler’s exterior. It will have to withstand being immersed in water for long periods of time, greatly varying temperatures, vibrations and shocks as well as being hit by projectiles. The placement as well as the design of the enclosure should be chosen with respect to both the devices length of life and how well it fulfils its intended role and achieves the expected results. To produce an enclosure and find a placement aiming to satisfy these conditions, a traditional product development process were executed. The articulated haulers as well as relevant literature were researched. Concepts were generated and evaluated by both the author and by employees at Volvo Construction Equipment until a final concept for the enclosure and placement were found. The enclosure were then designed in detail specifying the material, manufacturing techniques, controlled for thermodynamic circumstances, modelled in Catia V 5 and controlled for vibrations. It was concluded that the enclosure should be able protect the ICCS-module after some more development and that the placement and cable routing results in a much shorter total cable length...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of a superconducting coil used in fusion devices reveals that {{a wide spectrum of}} coupled physical problems should be taken into account during its design. This is also a good example of a general {{analysis of}} a hierarchical structure. Due to the large number of repetitive superconducting strands, the single cable can be considered as a homogeneous body in meso-scale, each strand being {{at the same time a}} micro composite of several components. A <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> makes in turn a substantial part of a larger, D shaped superconducting coil. The above problems are numerically analysed using various, specialised algorithms of FE method. The single strand has its internal structure. It is made of filaments of superconducting alloy embedded in a matrix of bronze. The detailed geometry of the microstructure depends on the strand type. At this stage the classical model of Kirchhoff-Bernoulli beam is applicable, for which the beam type stiffness is computed by means of homogenisation theory and beam-type kinematical hypothesis. A triplet of strands can be seen as a single beam, but in this case the Kirrchhoff-Bernoulli hypothesis is not sufficient to define the mechanics of the structure. The common mechanical work of the triplet is influenced by friction between strands, their pointwise contacts and the helicoidal geometry. We propose a mixed Kirchhoff-Timoshenko approach with a torsion-tension coupling to model the beam-like behaviour at this stage and at the higher order cabling stages. Thus we are performing a successive substitution of discrete models involving many beams (three at the level of the triplet, four at the level of quadruplet) with a single, continuous beam model, that can be qualitatively different and the parameters of which can be deduced from the preceding cabling stages. This recursive substitution allows to maintain the number of beam elements in the model around a reasonable optimum. Since the thermo-mechanical loading is applied at the macro level, the analysis of the macro structure is indispensable. On the other hand, the most important engineering phenomena are related to the micro components of the composite. In our approach we can recover the micro-structural effects from the results at the macro level via suitable unsmearing procedures. All along the hierarchically organised FE analysis of the structure we deal with coupled thermo-mechanical phenomena and local material yielding occurring at the level of the micro structure. The lecture is illustrated with some examples revealing the specific properties of the different beam models at several cabling stages and with an overview of the model of the bundle of strands...|$|E

40|$|Prestressed constructions {{have been}} {{extensively}} used since the 1950 s for infrastructure and large-span constructions. During maintenance renovation and after events causing damages, {{it is often}} important to know the current stress on the prestressed steel elements of the structure, such as strands or cables. Limited access can often be provided. Then a nondestructive assessment of the current stress is possible. However, several points {{have to be taken}} into account before micromagnetic or ultrasound testing methods can be used for determining the current stress value. For both methods, the determination of quantitative values requires a prior calibration. Micromagnetic measurements were performed with the micromagnetic multiparameter microstructure and stress analysis approach developed by Fraunhofer IZFP. It has different sensitivities for microstructure and stress state, but disturbing influences related to microstructure, geometrical effects, temperature, etc. also have {{to be taken into account}}. Ultrasound testing for stress determination is based on very accurate time-of-flight (TOF) measurements. The influence of texture of the steel also needs to be considered. Electromagnetic acoustic transducers allow the generation of shear horizontal wave modes, which are optimal to fulfil this requirement. A further advantage is that no couplant is needed and even a small lift off (e. g., due to a coating) is allowed. The paper explains how quantitative stress values can be determined based on micromagnetic and ultrasound testing TOF data recorded in the field and laboratory. Furthermore, a micromagnetic monitoring example is described. Two <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> bridge <b>cables</b> <b>of</b> a suspension bridge were instrumented with micromagnetic sensors.

The long-term monitoring shows stress changes due to traffic and the renovation of the bridge as well as temperature-induced stress changes in the bridge cables...|$|R
40|$|I {{develop an}} {{empirical}} model {{of demand for}} large bundles, {{and use it to}} analyze <b>bundling</b> <b>of</b> channels in <b>cable</b> television. Concerns over cable companies’bundling practices and rapid price increases have led to a heated policy debate about government-mandated unbundling (requiring cable companies to o¤er subscriptions to “themed tiers”or individual channels). I focus on the likely short-run e¤ects of unbundling policies for consumers, networks and cable operators. I model consumers’choice <b>of</b> cable/satellite packages (<b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> channels) and their subsequent viewing choices for individual channels in the bundle. The main identifying assumption is that consumers’valuation <b>of</b> a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> channels is the utility they get from viewing those channels. This allows me to identify consumers’dollar valuations for individual channels (even though they are always sold in large bundles), and to predict their subscriptions and viewing choices in unbundling counterfactuals. I estimate the model using individual-level data on cable/satellite subscriptions and viewership for 64 main cable channels. I use the estimates to simulate the “themed tiers ” scenario (breaking up the bundle into 7 mini-tiers by channel genre). I …nd that consumers do not gain much from unbundling. The best-case increase in consumer surplus is estimated at just 35 cents per household per month. Cable networks are likely to experience a sharp drop in the number of subscribers (but not in viewership), which might force them to sharply increase the license fees they charge per subscriber (in this case, unbundling would harm consumers). I am especially grateful to Bharat Anand, Julie Mortimer and Ariel Pakes for their guidance and suggestions.
