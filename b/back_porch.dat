5|$|Another failed product, {{this time}} under Grand Metropolitan's {{successor}} Diageo, was the BK <b>Back</b> <b>Porch</b> Grillers line of burgers that featured a spiced and flavored patty {{served on a}} bakery-style roll. There were two varieties: The Regular served with mayonnaise, whole leaf iceberg lettuce, tomato and grilled onions, and the Bacon Cheddar, with bacon and smoked cheddar cheese. There was one LTO variety, the Black Stack Griller, made with Black Strap Barbecue sauce (a strong molasses-flavored sauce), Swiss cheese, bacon, and onions, to promote Men in Black II. The Griller patty was flavored so {{that it had a}} taste similar to a hamburger that had been grilled over a charcoal-fired grill.|$|E

25|$|When Lois Starkey and Bill Gilmartin {{acquired}} 30 York Street in 1993, {{they made}} several architectural changes including enclosing the building’s <b>back</b> <b>porch</b> {{in order to}} add windows and square footage to Gallery 30’s retail gallery space. In 2007, Linda Atiyeh acquired 30 York Street. Atiyeh continued to operate Gallery 30 at its original location, making only minor architectural adjustments to the building’s interior.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, a <b>back</b> <b>porch</b> {{was added}} to the home and a garage was built on the {{northwest}} corner of the lot. A year later, the new owners added a second bedroom to the northwest corner of the house. With that addition, today’s historic structure was complete. Subsequent alterations changed some of the original characteristics. For example, in the 1970s, the original double-hung windows were replaced by aluminum frame windows. The original doors were also replaced during that period.|$|E

Its global youth program, Roots & Shoots began in 1991 when a group of 16 local teenagers met with Goodall on her <b>back</b> <b>porch</b> in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. They were eager to discuss a range of problems they knew about from first-hand experience that caused them deep concern. The organisation now has over 10,000 groups in over 100 countries.|$|E
25|$|Purcell and Elmslie set {{the house}} thirty feet {{behind the front}} {{property}} line, conserving a sense of privacy for its inhabitants and allowing them to look over their neighbors’ gardens to their north and south, rather than through their windows. Likewise, the Purcells and the neighbors could enjoy the home’s front garden, created in collaboration with landscape architect Harry Franklin Baker, including a reflecting pool with water plants and small fountain, and native plants and trees. The <b>back</b> <b>porch</b> overlooked the Lake of the Isles, where the Purcells could enjoy a secluded natural haven {{in the center of}} Minneapolis, in concordance with Prairie School ideals.|$|E
25|$|The resort {{was renamed}} Shades of Green. Since its opening, {{it has been}} running at or near 100% capacity. The name of the resort refers to {{the colors of the}} {{different}} uniforms. While all services have different colored Class A Uniforms, all war-fighting uniforms have some shade of green. The resort previously had a small cafe located near the lobby called Cafe Belle and a lounge called the <b>Back</b> <b>Porch.</b> The resort temporarily closed on April 1, 2002 in order to allow the demolition of the original building and commence the construction of a brand new building. The resort's renovation took nearly two years to complete and finally re-opened to the public on March 31, 2004. This major expansion from 2002 to 2004 gave the resort a capacity of 586 guest rooms. KBJ Architects was the main architect of the resort expansion.|$|E

25|$|Manon {{had never}} {{let go of}} her desire to act. She had even written the famous Burgtheater actor Raoul Aslan a letter and a poem in which she {{expressed}} her desire to one day perform on the same stage. With her dark long hair and beauty, she so impressed the theater director Max Reinhardt, that he offered the part of First Angel in a revival of his and Hugo von Hofmannsthal's adaptation of Calderón's The Great Theater of the World for the Salzburg Festival of 1934. Werfel, however, did not think Manon had the training for such an important role, having only performed in a few theater productions that he had directed himself to entertain her mother and their friends on the long <b>back</b> <b>porch</b> of Haus Mahler in Breitenstein, a porch designed by her father in 1916. So, as her stepfather, Werfel refused to allow Manon the opportunity.|$|E
25|$|Charles Cortimiglia was an {{immigrant}} {{who lived with}} his wife and baby on the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Second Street in Gretna, Louisiana, a New Orleans suburb, across the Mississippi River. On the night of March 10, 1919, screams were heard coming from the Cortimiglia Residence. Grocer Iorlando Jordano rushed across the street to investigate. Upon his arrival, Jordano noticed that Charles Cortimiglia, his wife Rosie, and their infant daughter, Mary, had all been attacked by the unknown intruder. Rosie stood in the doorway with a serious head wound, clutching her deceased daughter. Charles laid on the floor, bleeding profusely. The couple was rushed to Charity Hospital, where it was discovered that both had suffered skull fractures. Nothing was stolen from the house, but a panel on the back door had been chiseled away. A bloody axe was found on the <b>back</b> <b>porch</b> of the home. Charles was released two days later, while his wife remained in the care of doctors. Upon gaining full consciousness, Rosie made claims that Iorlando Jordano and his 18-year-old son, Frank, were responsible for the attacks. Iorlando, a 69-year-old man, was in too poor of health to have committed the crimes. Frank Jordano, more than six feet tall and weighing over 200 pounds, would have been too large to have fit through the panel on the back door. Charles Cortimiglia vehemently denied his wife's claims, yet police nonetheless arrested the two, and charged them with the murder. The men would later be found guilty. Frank was sentenced to hang, and his father to life in prison. Charles Cortimiglia divorced his wife after the trial. Almost a year later, Rosie announced that she had falsely accused the two out of jealousy and spite. Her statement was the only evidence against the Jordanos, and they were released from jail shortly thereafter.|$|E

500|$|The main {{residence}} of the Fort George plantation is a unique two-story house that was probably constructed between 1797 and 1798 by John McQueen, who indicated in a letter {{at the time that}} he had built a comfortable house for himself. The house—resembling 17th century British gentry homes—has a large center room and four one-story pavilions at each corner that allowed air to circulate through them to keep them cooler in the summer; each was a bedroom that had a fireplace to heat more efficiently in the winter. The second story of the house has two large rooms. On the roof is a deck and the house faces Fort George Inlet and features two porches on the front and rear of the house. A brick walkway joined the <b>back</b> <b>porch</b> to a wharf on the inlet while Kingsley was in residence.
