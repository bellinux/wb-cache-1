This study aims to portray the demographic and socioeconomic profile and the sexual behavior of pregnant teenagers. It is a cross-sectional study accomplished at Family Health Units in a Brazilian northeast city. Participated in the study 50 adolescents between 13 and 19 years of age. It was adopted a survey with open and closed ended questions. Among the adolescents menarche occurred at an average of 11. 68 years of age (pd = 1. 3); 48 % of them had their first sexual intercourse before 16 years-old (group average = 14. 30 – dp = 1. 71); the majority were primigravidae; abstained from alcohol ingestion during the gestational period and did not use birth-control methods; 98 % had low family income. The pregnancy was a reason for school evasion. The knowledge of <b>birth-control</b> <b>methods</b> was not an impedible factor to the early pregnancy.

40|$|Efforts {{to avoid}} an {{undesired}} conception have been known for, perhaps, {{as long as the}} history of the human kind. The development of new <b>birth-control</b> <b>methods</b> as such is not a new discovery. What is new, however, is the wide development of all methods conceivable and their use. One of such new methods is, among others, female sterilization. So far, this method has not been used widely in the Czech Republic. The rate of sterilized women here reaches a little less than 3 %. Compared to other countries where sterilized women account for as many as one third of women, the Czech Republic falls behind. Still, {{this does not mean that}} Czech women are not interested in sterilization. The current situation in which sterilization is unpopular is, to a large measure, the consequence of obsolete regulations as well as poor knowledgeability of the subject among the lay public and insufficient promotion of the method. The theoretical section of my thesis provides a summary of known facts about female sterilization. It elaborates on preoperative and post-operative care of women concerned, complications, as well as any potential dissatisfaction with the method and later applications for in-vitro fertilization. The practical part of my thesis is divided into two subsections. First focuses on women?s (public?s) informedness about sterilization, the other elaborates on the knowledgeability and experience of nurses / midwives in selected hospitals providing female sterilization. To get insight into the issue and to achieve the below objectives, I performed my survey research in the form of quantitative analysis. Specifically, the research was carried out using two types of questionnaires when the first one was given to women hospitalized in gynecology departments and the other was handed out to nurses/midwives working there. My research was conducted at the České Budějovice Hospital and Tábor Hospital. My work had 4 objectives and 4 therewith related hypothesis. The first objective was to find out the level of women?s knowledge about sterilization as a form of permanent contraception. The hypothesis ensuing from the first objective is: Women are informed about sterilization as a method of permanent contraception. Another objective was to ascertain whether women would consider having a sterilization done in the future. The second hypothesis is: Women older than 35 years prefer sterilization to other contraception methods. The third objective was to establish whether women know the relevant legal prerequisites to have sterilization done. The third hypothesis assumes that women are aware of the legal prerequisites to have sterilization done. The last objective was to find out in what form, if any, nurses / midwives inform patients on the possibilities of sterilization. The fourth hypothesis assumes that nurses / midwives do not inform gynecology department patients on the possibilities of sterilization. All the above objectives were accomplished. Hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 4 were confirmed. Hypotheses 2 and 3 were not confirmed. This bachelor?s thesis may serve as a study material for other midwife class years as well as for nurses / midwives working in gynecology departments who might provide relevant information and support to women considering having the relevant surgery. Last but not least, my thesis could also be used as an educational material for the lay public in order to improve general awareness of the contraception methods available...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} study, The Other Half of My Body: Coming into Being in Rural Bangladesh, is {{to bring}} {{fertility}} practices under a close scrutiny, based on ethnographic research. The study shows how reproduction is simultaneously encompassing {{the impact of the}} population policy [...] influenced by the international community of development agencies [...] and the local symbols and metaphors, and the symbolic acts of conception, contraception, and childbirth as presented inside a micro-community. The anthropological fieldwork was conducted and completed in Bangladesh, in the village of Mayapara between the years 1995 and 1998, with the use of both qualitative and quantitave methods. The methodologies and analyses used in the studies of Bangladeshi women have represented them as a single category within a narrow focus in seclusion subordinated by marriage, as well as in relation to property and employment, but not {{in the context of a}} broader social process. In Ortner's (1994, 1996, 2) words we can say that studies on Bangladeshi women have seen them from a structuralist-determinist point of view, where human action is constrained by the given social and cultural order and system, whereas less attention has been given as to how these are produced, reproduced, and challenged in practice. In this study, I have used the perceptions of procreation and fertility practices as an entry point for studying the social life i. e. how local culture is produced and whether and how it is contested, but also how people perceive and make possible the creation of the next generation. The focus of this study has been to find out how the cultural construction of fertility and health, and, especially, the reproductive health, mediate the relationship between sex and gender. Despite the complexity of the term "reproduction," I have focused on the specific subject of human reproduction that encompasses all stages of human life and, especially, the female life cycle: the perception of fertility and conception, as well as the issues of pregnancy and childbirth - all entailing much more than a mere biological reproduction. Kinship, as a symbolic and culture specific domain, incorporates the notions of gender and religiousness. All these have been investigated through perceptions of procreation as well as those of coming into being in the village of Mayapara. In the local discourse, fertility is not conceptualized as a wholly natural phenomenon but, rather, as a capacity of a person that has to be socially augmented. The meaning of the body and its procreative substances and fluids are intimately related to the speculation of procreation and coming into being. By situating fertility, its practices and perceptions, I have aimed to show that there is no universal Islamic thought residing in an episteme that would link the female and male correspondences with the monogenetic theory of procreation. The theories and perceptions are culture specific and in Mayapara, in the local speculations of procreation, neither the man nor the woman are seen to be the creative and engendering agent alone without the other, but both partners are equally needed, encompassing each other. The dialogues of women in the rural Bangladesh touch upon multiple domains: work, family relationships, lived tradition, and current family planning discourses. I suggest that, in a way, the Bangladeshi women have occupied a median position between the modernity and tradition of the birth culture. They negotiate and come into terms with both and they are able to choose the aspects of tradition and modernity that best suit their circumstances and render their lives dynamic [...] not static, as is often claimed. Whereas women use traditional methods with herbs and rituals to enhance fertility and rely on the village midwives to conduct the deliveries, the practice of birth control is mainly based on the culture of modem <b>birth-control</b> <b>methods</b> due to the widespread National Family Planning Program.

40|$|La iniciación de las relaciones sexuales es cada vez más temprana en los jóvenes. Entre otras razones, esto se debe a cambios en la actitud social hacia la sexualidad y a una maduración sexual más temprana. La precocidad en las relaciones sexuales no ocurre paralelamente con una adecuada educación sexual que brinde al adolescente la información sobre las consecuencias de tal acto, para el cual no está preparado; los profesionales de la atención primaria de salud deben conocer la situación existente en su área para actuar convenientemente. Identificar el nivel de conocimientos elementales sobre educación sexual en adolescentes de la Escuela Secundaria Básica Urbana (ESBU). ubicada en nuestra área de salud. Se realizó una investigación descriptiva, transversal, en la ESBU "XI Festival de la Juventud y los Estudiantes" del Reparto Alamar, Municipio Habana del Este, ubicada en el área de salud atendida por nuestro policlínico 13 de marzo. El universo estuvo constituido por 200 estudiantes. Se incluyeron todos los estudiantes de noveno grado, quienes voluntariamente desearon participar; no hubo criterios de exclusión. Se aplicó una encuesta para conocer: edad de comienzo de relaciones sexuales y conocimientos sobre riesgo del embarazo en la adolescencia, infecciones de transmisión sexual (ITS), métodos anticonceptivos, uso de anticonceptivos en la primera relación y vías de información sobre educación sexual. La información fue almacenada en una base de datos EPIINFO; los datos se organizaron en tablas y para su análisis se utilizó el método porcentual. Cerca de 60 % de los encuestados habían tenido relaciones sexuales. Entre las ITS más conocidas se encontraron el VIH/SIDA, gonorrea y sífilis. A pesar de conocer de la existencia de métodos para la anticoncepción, 70 % de los 114 jóvenes, quienes manifestaron haber tenido relaciones sexuales, acudieron a este primer evento sin ninguna protección. Las fuentes de mayor información sobre educación sexual fueron de manera general, TV, maestros y padres. Los varones recibieron información mayormente de TV (58. 3 %), padres (48. 5 %) y la radio (34. 9 %), mientras que las féminas la obtuvieron de maestros (54. 6 %), TV (44. 3 %) y médico y enfermera de la familia (39. 2 %). En estos jóvenes, los conocimientos elementales sobre educación sexual son aún insuficientes y la familia debe tener un mayor papel protagónico para ambos sexos, pues mucha información proviene de otras fuentes. The {{initiation}} {{of the sexual}} relationships {{is more and more}} early in the youths. Among other reasons, this is due to changes in the social attitude toward the sexuality and to an earlier sexual maturation. The precocity in the sexual relationships doesn't happen parallelly with an appropriate sexual education that offers the adolescent the information on the consequences of such an act, for which is not prepared; the professionals of the primary attention of health should know the existent situation in their area to act meetly. To identify the level of elementary knowledge on sexual education in adolescents of the urban basic high school (ESBU) located in our area of health. Methods were carried out a descriptive, traverse investigation, in the ESBU "XI Festival of the Youth and the Students" of Alamar, Municipality Havana of the East, located in the area of health assisted by our policlínico March 13. The universe was constituted by 200 students. All the students of ninth grade were included that voluntarily wanted to participate; there were not exclusion approaches. A survey was applied to know: age of beginning of sexual relationships and knowledge on: risk of the pregnancy in the adolescence, infections of sexual transmission (ITS), <b>birth-control</b> <b>methods,</b> use of contraceptives in the first relationship and roads of information has more than enough sexual education. The information was stored in a database EPIINFO; the data were organized in charts and it stops their analysis the percentage method it was used. Results near 60 % of those interviewed had had sexual relationships, mainly of the 13 - 14 year-old group. Most identified the damage to the mother like risk of the pregnancy in the adolescence. Among the good known ITS they were the VIH/SIDA, gonorrhea and syphilis. In spite of knowing of the existence of methods for the contraception, 70 % of the 114 youths that you/they manifested to have had sexual relationships went to this first event without any protection. The sources of more information have more than enough sexual education they were in general way, the TV, teachers and parents. The males received information mostly from the TV (58. 3 %), parents (48. 5 %) and the radio (34. 9 %), while the féminas obtained it of teachers (54. 6 %), TV (44. 3 %) and doctor and nurse of the family (39. 2 %). In these youths the elementary knowledge on sexual education are even insufficient and the family should play a bigger protagonistic list for both sexes, because a lot of information comes from other sources...|$|R
