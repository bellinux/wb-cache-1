Given n points in the plane, {{we would like to}} nd a tour that visits all of them and that minimizes the distance travelled, where the distance between two points is given by the Euclidean distance. This problem will be denoted by ETSP (Euclidean TSP). In a companion set of notes, we will present very recent algorithms of Arora and Mitchell that produce in polynomial time a tour which is within 1 + of the optimum, for any xed > 0. In this set of notes, we rst present some preliminaries and older related results. Before we continue, {{we should point out that}} it is not known whether the Euclidean TSP is in NP. Even if we are presented with a candidate tour for the -no " version of the problem, we do not know how to avoid computing a possibly exponential number of decimal digits, in order to calculate the square root required for the Euclidean distance.

50|$|After 25 {{years of}} near {{continuous}} warfare, the armies that {{met at the}} Battle of Waterloo were organised in a similar manner-into corps which contained infantry, cavalry and artillery (see Order of battle of the Waterloo Campaign), and used similar combined arms tactics. Within each corps were divisions of infantry or cavalry made up of brigades and an artillery unit. An army would usually also have reserves of all three arms under the direct command of the army commander which could be sent in support of any corps or division of a corps to increase any arm which the army general considered necessary. The great French cavalry charge commanded by Marshal Ney during the battle failed to break Wellington's squares of infantry and Ney's failure to supplement his cavalry with sufficient horse artillery to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>squares</b> open is usually given as a major contributing factor in the failure.

40|$|Charge density-wave {{order has}} been {{observed}} in cuprate superconductors whose crystal structure <b>breaks</b> <b>the</b> <b>square</b> symmetry of <b>the</b> CuO 2 planes, such as orthorhombic YBa 2 Cu 3 Oy (YBCO), but not so far in cuprates that preserve that symmetry, such as tetragonal HgBa 2 CuO 4 +d (Hg 1201). We have measured the Hall (R_H), Seebeck (S), and Nernst coefficients of underdoped Hg 1201 in magnetic fields large enough to suppress superconductivity. The high-field R_H(T) and S(T) are found to drop with decreasing temperature and become negative, as also observed in YBCO at comparable doping. In YBCO, the negative R_H and S are signatures of a small electron pocket caused by Fermi-surface reconstruction, attributed to charge density-wave modulations observed in the same range of doping and temperature. We deduce that a similar Fermi-surface reconstruction takes place in Hg 1201, evidence that density-wave order exists in this material. A striking similarity {{is also found in}} the normal-state Nernst coefficient, further supporting this interpretation. Given the model nature of Hg 1201, Fermi-surface reconstruction appears to be common to all hole-doped cuprates, suggesting that density-wave order is a fundamental property of these materials...|$|R

Sharpe forces him to fight threatening to kill him if he doesn't. A duel ensues in which Sharpe kills Leroux and then recovers Leroux's Klingenthal sabre and the coded book. Hélène leaves Salamanca, although {{as a member of the}} Spanish aristocracy it is not in the British interest to create a scandal by pursuing her as a French spy. She encounters Sharpe as he is leaving and seeing her brother's sword, she asks if Sharpe killed him. Sharpe confirms this and that her brother had killed her horse.

5000|$|At Waterloo Ney again {{commanded}} {{the left wing}} of the army. At around 3:30 p.m., Ney ordered a mass cavalry charge against the Anglo-Allied line. Ney's cavalry overran the enemy cannons but found the infantry formed in cavalry-proof square formations. Ney, without infantry or artillery support, failed to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>squares.</b> <b>The</b> action earned Ney criticism, and some argue that it led to Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo. Debate continues as to {{the responsibility for the}} cavalry charge and why it went unsupported. Ney's cavalry also failed to spike enemy cannon (driving iron spikes into the firing holes) while they were under French control (during the cavalry attack, the crews of the cannon retreated into <b>the</b> <b>squares</b> for protection, and then re-manned their pieces as the horsemen withdrew). Ney's cavalry carried the equipment needed to spike cannons, and spiking the cannons would probably have made them useless {{for the rest of the}} battle. The loss of a large number of cannon would have weakened the army and could have caused the Anglo-Allied force to withdraw from the battle. Ney was seen during one of the charges beating his sword against the side of a British cannon in furious frustration. During the battle, he had five horses killed under him; and at the end of the day, Ney led one of the last infantry charges, shouting to his men: [...] "Come and see how a marshal of France meets his death!

At very low volume fractions, the large scale structure (fractal dimension), size distribution and growth kinetics of the clusters was found to be close to that known for DLCA with rigid bonds.

We cannot follow Bruce {{through his}} {{campaign}} in the north, where he ruined the country of the Comyns (1308), and through the victories in Galloway of his hard-fighting brother Edward. With enemies on every side, Bruce took them in detail; early in March 1309 he routed the Macdowals at {{the west end of}} the Pass of Brander. Edward II. was involved in disputes with his own barons, and Bruce was recognised by his country's Church in 1310 and aided by his great lieutenants, Sir James Douglas and Thomas Randolph, Earl of Murray. By August 1311 Bruce was carrying the war into England, sacking Durham and Chester, failing at Carlisle, but in January 1313, capturing Perth. In summer, Edward Bruce, in the spirit of chivalry, gave to Stirling Castle (Randolph had taken Edinburgh Castle) a set day, Midsummer Day 1314, to be relieved or to surrender; and Bruce kept tryst with Edward II. and his English and Irish levies, and all his adventurous chivalry from France, Hainault, Bretagne, Gascony, and Aquitaine. All the world knows the story of the first battle, the Scottish Quatre Bras; the success of Randolph on the right; the slaying of Bohun when Bruce broke his battle-axe. Next day Bruce's position was strong; beneath the towers of Stirling the Bannockburn protected his front; morasses only to be crossed by narrow paths impeded the English advance. Edward Bruce commanded the right wing; Randolph the centre; Douglas and the Steward the left; Bruce the reserve, the Islesmen. His strength lay in his spearmen's [...] "dark impenetrable wood"; his archers were ill-trained; of horse he had but a handful under Keith, the Marischal. But the heavy English cavalry could not <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>squares</b> of spears; Keith cut up the archers of England; the main body could not deploy, and the slow, relentless advance of the whole Scottish line covered the plain with the dying and the flying.

In eight strenuous years the generalship of Bruce and his war-leaders, the resolution of the people, hardened by the cruelties of Edward, the sermons of the clergy, and the utter incompetence of Edward II., had redeemed a desperate chance.
