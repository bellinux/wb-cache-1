40|$|The ‘Lely Discovery’ is an {{automated}} mobile <b>barn</b> <b>cleaner,</b> which routes are programmed by a ‘teaching method’. The routes are specified by a linear action sequence {{to be executed}} by the robot. Teaching a route to the Lely Discovery requires users to execute every action first by walking the robot through the barn. The route teaching method is time consuming and the current interface of the teaching method is not user-friendly. When a route requires changes for optimizing the route, the user has to re-execute all the route actions on the robot {{to and from the}} position where he wants to change the route. This thesis explores the implementation of a route drawing system which enables users to draw routes on a map. This system can generate an action sequence from the drawn routes on the map. Users can program routes 2 – 3 times faster than with the teaching method and route changes can be made in short notice. In this thesis the results of a user study are presented and the results of the tested routes on the robot via a first prototype of the drawing system. Although the results are not convincing, they provide useful leads for the design of a second prototype. Interactive IntelligenceElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E
40|$|Paved {{yards and}} feeding floors are a {{valuable}} asset on livestock farms, particularly where lots are flat and poorly drained. At no time are paved yards more appreciated than {{during periods of}} prolonged rainfall or in the late winter and early spring when frost thaws out and yards are seemingly bottomless. Livestock farmers who have enjoyed the use of paved yards and feeding floors {{will tell you that}} these improvements offer the following advantages: Livestock not forced to waste energy in wading through knee-deep, mud make more rapid gains. Paved yards can be kept sanitary, which means healthier, more thrifty animals. Chores are made easier. More manure is saved for producing bigger crops. Feed is saved because it is not trampled into the mud. This is important for hogs following steers. For the dairyman, a paved strip keeps the <b>barn</b> and cows <b>cleaner</b> and it reduces labor necessary for washing the cows before milking. Where yards are sloping, pavement prevents soil erosion in rainy weather; prevents undermining of foundations from eaves-drip...|$|R
