5000|$|According to art {{historian}} Martha Drexler Lynn, [...] "Labino had a life-long love of tools, inventing and problem-solving which he {{coupled with a}} passion for artistic endeavors..." [...] His interest in <b>blowing</b> <b>glass</b> began in the 1930s, when he ran the Owens-Illinois milk bottling plant. There he had a laboratory in which he created glass formulas. In 1940, his predecessor at the plant, Ben Alderson, showed Labino how to <b>blow</b> <b>glass.</b> Labino later <b>blew</b> <b>glass</b> as a hobby; at Johns-Manville he built a home glass furnace at which to pursue the craft. An early project was a glass paperweight that he created in 1958 for a friend's retirement. By 1960 he had melted a batch of glass and created a primitive blowpipe.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{fabrication}} {{process for the}} simultaneous shaping of arrays of glass shells on a wafer level is introduced in this paper. The process is based on etching cavities in silicon, followed by an-odic bonding of a thin glass wafer to the etched silicon wafer. The bonded wafers are then heated inside a furnace at a temperature above the softening point of the glass, and due {{to the expansion of}} the trapped gas in the silicon cavities the <b>glass</b> is <b>blown</b> into three-dimensional spherical shells. An analytical model which can be used to predict the shape of the glass shells is described and demon-strated to match the experimental data. The ability to <b>blow</b> <b>glass</b> on a wafer level may enable novel capabilities including mass-pro-duction of microscopic spherical gas confinement chambers, mi-crolenses, and complex microfluidic networks.

25|$|However, {{during the}} last thirty years of the 1st century AD there was a marked change in style, with strong colours disappearing rapidly, {{replaced}} by ‘aqua’ and true colourless glasses. Colourless and ‘aqua’ glasses had been in use for vessels and some mosaic designs prior to this, but start to dominate the <b>blown</b> <b>glass</b> market at this time. The use of strong colours in cast glass died out during this period, with colourless or 'aqua' glasses dominating the last class of cast vessels to be produced in quantity, as mould and free-blowing took over during the 1st century AD.|$|E

25|$|The glass blowing {{tradition}} was carried on in Europe from the medieval period through the Middle Ages to the Renaissance in {{the demise of}} the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. During the early medieval period, the Franks manipulated the technique of glassblowing by creating the simple corrugated molds and developing the claws decoration techniques. <b>Blown</b> <b>glass</b> objects, such as the drinking vessels that imitated the shape of the animal horn were produced in the Rhine and Meuse valleys, as well as in Belgium. The Byzantine glassworkers made mold-blown glass decorated with Christian and Jewish symbols in Jerusalem between late 6th century and the middle of the 7th century AD. Mold-blown vessels with facets, relief and linear-cut decoration were discovered at Samarra in the Islamic lands.|$|E

40|$|Industrial <b>glass</b> <b>blowing</b> is an {{essential}} stage of manufacturing hollow glass containers, e. g., bottles, jars. A glass preform is brought into a mold and inflated with compressed air until it reaches the mold shape. A simulation model for <b>blowing</b> <b>glass</b> containers based on finite element methods, which adopts a level set method to track the glass–air interfaces, has previously been developed [Giannopapa and Groot, 2007, 2 ̆ 2 A Computer Simulation Model for the Blow–Blow Forming Process of Glass Containers, 2 ̆ 2 Paper No. PVP 2007 - 26408, pp. 79 – 86; Giannopapa, C.

Fluids Eng., 133 (2), p. 021103]. A considerable challenge in <b>glass</b> <b>blowing</b> is the inverse problem: to determine an optimal preform from the desired container shape. In previous work of the authors [Groot et al., 2009, 2 ̆ 2 Numerical Optimisation of <b>Blowing</b> <b>Glass</b> Parison Shapes, 2 ̆ 2 ASME Paper No. PVP 2009 - 77946; Groot et al., 2011, 2 ̆ 2 Development of a Numerical Optimization Method for <b>Blowing</b> <b>Glass</b> Parison Shapes, 2 ̆ 2 ASME J. Manuf. Sci. Eng., 133 (1), p. 011010] a numerical method was introduced for optimizing {{the shape of the}} preform. The optimization method described the shape of the preform by parametric curves, e. g., Bezier-curves or splines, and employed a modified Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm to find the optimal positions of the control points of the curves. A combined finite difference and Broyden method was used to compute the Jacobian of the residual with respect to changes in the positions of the control points. The objective {{of this paper is to}} perform an error analysis of the optimization method previously introduced and to improve its accuracy and performance. The improved optimization method is applied to modeled containers of industrial relevance, which shows its usefulness for practical applications...|$|R

25|$|Glass was a {{desirable}} material for mirrors. Because {{the surface of}} glass is naturally smooth, it produces reflections with very little blur. In addition, glass is very hard and scratch resistant. However, glass by itself has little reflectivity, so people began coating it with metals to increase the reflectivity. Metal-coated glass mirrors are said by the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder to have been invented in Sidon (modern-day Lebanon) {{in the first century}} AD, although no archeological evidence of them date from before the third century. According to Pliny, the people of Sidon developed a technique for creating crude mirrors by coating <b>blown</b> <b>glass</b> with molten lead. Glass mirrors backed with gold leaf are mentioned by Pliny in his Natural History, written in about 77 AD. Because there were few ways to make a smooth piece of glass with a uniform thickness, these ancient glass-mirrors were made by blowing a glass bubble, and then cutting off a small, circular section, producing mirrors that were either concave or convex. These circular mirrors were typically small, from only a fraction of an inch to as much as eight inches in diameter. These small mirrors produced distorted images, yet were prized objects of high value. These ancient glass mirrors were very thin, thus very fragile, because the glass needed to be extremely thin to prevent cracking when coated with a hot, molten metal. Due to the poor quality, high cost, and small size of these ancient glass mirrors, solid metal-mirrors primarily of steel were usually preferred until the late nineteenth century.|$|E

500|$|In 1962 Littleton’s first {{pieces in}} <b>blown</b> <b>glass</b> were, like his earlier works in pottery, {{functional}} forms: vases, bowls and paperweights.

The object lay in his studio for several weeks before he decided to grind the bottom. As Littleton recounts in his book Glassblowing: A Search for Form, he brought the object into the house where [...] "it aroused such antipathy in my wife that I looked at it much more closely, finally deciding to send it to an exhibition. Its refusal there made me even more obstinate, and I took it to New York ... I later showed it to the curators of design at the Museum of Modern Art. They, perhaps relating it to some other neo-Dada work in the museum, purchased it for the Design Collection." [...] This led to Littleton’s mid-1960s series of broken-open forms, and [...] "Prunted," [...] "Imploded" [...] and [...] "Exploded" [...] forms.|$|E
