50|$|In {{banking and}} finance, a <b>bullet</b> <b>loan</b> is a loan where a payment {{of the entire}} {{principal}} of the loan, and sometimes the principal and interest, is due {{at the end of}} the loan term. Likewise for bullet bond. A <b>bullet</b> <b>loan</b> can be a mortgage, bond, note or any other type of credit.|$|E
50|$|Bullet {{loans are}} common, and usually {{referred}} to by other names; <b>bullet</b> <b>loan</b> is a generic and unofficial term. Many types of publicly traded bonds and notes constitute bullet loans: the face value of the bond is payable at bond maturity, and only interest payments are due during the interim periods. Short-term bonds or notes which pay no interest are also a form of <b>bullet</b> <b>loan.</b>|$|E
50|$|The WAL of a <b>bullet</b> <b>loan</b> (non-amortizing) {{is exactly}} the tenor, as the {{principal}} is repaid precisely at maturity.|$|E
50|$|In China, {{certain types}} of <b>bullet</b> <b>loans</b> have been {{prohibited}} by the China Banking Regulatory Commission due to concerns regarding Chinese banks' risk management capabilities. This extends only to lending to retail, commercial, and government clients, while not including the issuance of bonds or notes.|$|R

50|$|An amortizing loan {{should be}} contrasted with a <b>bullet</b> <b>loan,</b> where {{a large portion}} of the loan will be paid at the final {{maturity}} date instead of being paid down gradually over the loan's life.|$|E
50|$|A related {{piece of}} jargon is bullet payment. With a <b>bullet</b> <b>loan,</b> a bullet payment is paid {{back when the}} loan comes to its {{contractual}} maturity—e.g., reaches the deadline set to repayment {{at the time the}} loan was granted—representing the full loan amount (also called principal). Periodic interest payments are generally made throughout the life of the loan.|$|E
50|$|Credit risk: First {{and most}} importantly, it {{substantially}} reduces the credit {{risk of the}} loan or bond. In a <b>bullet</b> <b>loan</b> (or bullet bond), {{the bulk of the}} credit risk is in the repayment of the principal at maturity, at which point the debt must either be paid off in full or rolled over. By paying off the principal over time, this risk is mitigated.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the role Austrian {{investment}} companies and the mutual funds managed by them play {{in the context of}} financial stability. At {{the end of the third}} quarter 2009, the 30 Austrian investment companies (of which 5 manage real estate funds) had invested around EUR 114 billion in the market. Given the repercussions arising from interlocks between investment companies and other financial intermediaries (such as credit institutions, insurance companies, pension funds and severance funds) in the event of a financial crisis, this study explores the underlying risks and makes an attempt at quantifying the mutual dependencies, focusing above all on market and reputational risks. Areas that are relevant for financial stability include the contribution of investment companies to the profitability of banks and the potential risks related to the role of custodian banks. Furthermore, the distribution and administration of mutual funds issued by investment companies affiliated with banks is a source of commission income for the banking sector. Finally, the use of mutual funds (in unit-linked life insurance plans) as repayment vehicles for foreign-currency <b>bullet</b> <b>loans</b> may cause funding gaps in the event of poor fund performance, which could increase the credit risk exposure of the banks involved. ...|$|R
5000|$|Floating rate {{loans are}} {{sometimes}} referred to as bullet loans, although they are distinct concepts. In a <b>bullet</b> <b>loan,</b> a large payment (the [...] "bullet" [...] or [...] "balloon") is payable {{at the end of the}} loan, as opposed to a capital and interest loan, where the payment pattern incorporates level payments throughout the loan,each containing an element of capital, and no bullet payment at the end.A floating rate loan therefore may or may not incorporate a bullet payment.|$|E
50|$|Bullet loans {{should be}} contrasted with amortizing loans, where {{the amount of}} {{principal}} is paid down {{over the life of}} the loan. There is no requirement that a loan be a <b>bullet</b> <b>loan</b> or an amortizing loan; combinations of all sorts exist. For example, a loan may have a grace period during which no principal is paid; partial amortization during the remainder of the loan; and a bullet payment at the end of the loan that is some percentage of the original principal.|$|E
