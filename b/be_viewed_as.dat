5|$|Dedicated to Laura, {{daughter}} of the composer Isaac Albéniz. The eleventh and twelfth of the set can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> another contrasting pair. The eleventh is severe in mood and in rhythm, reflecting the prevailing austerity of Fauré's later style.|$|E
5|$|Points {{and lines}} may <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> special cases of circles; a point can be {{considered}} as a circle of infinitely small radius, and a line may be thought of an infinitely large circle whose center is also at infinity. From this perspective, the general Apollonius problem is that of constructing circles tangent to three given circles. The nine other cases involving points and lines may <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> limiting cases of the general problem. These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem; for example, the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions, since a point can be construed as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{resonators}} in the expression {{corresponds to the}} number of passbands required. Lowpass and highpass filters can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> special cases of the resonator expression with {{one or the other of}} the terms becoming zero as appropriate. Bandstop filters can be regarded as a combination of a lowpass and a highpass filter. Multiple bandstop filters can always be expressed in terms of a multiple bandpass filter. In this way it, can be seen that this transformation represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are to <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> special cases of it.|$|E

2500|$|Gambling {{by making}} money through the losses of others <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "form of greed", and is prohibited. The trading of stocks, shares and bonds <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> acceptable.|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} binary {{operations}} that can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> generalizations of the addition operation {{on the real}} numbers. The field of abstract algebra is centrally concerned with such generalized operations, and they also appear in set theory and category theory.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone may <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a heat engine that converts input heat {{energy from the}} surface into mechanical energy {{that can be used}} to do mechanical work against surface friction. At equilibrium, the rate of net energy production in the system must equal the rate of energy loss due to frictional dissipation at the surface, i.e.|$|E
5|$|Book {{embedding}} {{has also}} been frequently applied in the visualization of network data. Two of the standard layouts in graph drawing, arc diagrams and circular layouts, can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> book embeddings, and book embedding {{has also been}} applied {{in the construction of}} clustered layouts, simultaneous embeddings, and three-dimensional graph drawings.|$|E
50|$|Robert D. Putnam (2000) {{suggested}} a social capital concepts of bonding and bridging. Bonding <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> relations {{among members of}} the same community. Bridging <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> relationships between members among different communities.|$|R
50|$|Federation Council <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a {{more formal}} chamber of the Federal Assembly. Because of its federalist design, {{as well as its}} voting {{franchise}} strictly limited to provincial elites, the Council <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> less volatile to radical changes.|$|R
50|$|Among Palestinians, Mughrabi <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{a martyr}} in the {{struggle}} for the liberation of Palestine. Among Israelis, she <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a terrorist who was responsible for the deadliest terrorist attack {{in the history of the}} State of Israel.|$|R
5|$|By {{the later}} {{years of his}} life, Kennedy had come to <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a major figure and {{spokesman}} for American progressivism. In 2008, Kennedy was hospitalized after suffering a seizure and {{was diagnosed with a}} malignant brain tumor, which limited his appearances in the Senate. He died at age 77 on August 25, 2009, at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Graphs and {{directed}} graphs can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{a special case}} of the far more general notion called relational structures (defined as a set with a tuple of relations on it). Directed graphs are structures with a single binary relation (adjacency) on the domain (the vertex set). Under this view, homomorphisms of such structures are exactly graph homomorphisms.|$|E
5|$|Incidentally, the {{harmonic}} telegraph directly suggested to Bell {{the idea of}} the telephone. The reeds can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> transducers converting sound to and from an electrical signal. It is no great leap from this view of {{the harmonic}} telegraph to the idea that speech can be converted to and from an electrical signal.|$|E
50|$|Procurement is one {{component}} of the broader concept of sourcing and acquisition. Typically procurement <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> more tactical in nature (the process of physically buying a product or service) and sourcing and acquisition <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> more strategic and encompassing.|$|R

50|$|The {{value of}} {{organized}} religion <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a social institution that teaches ethics and social responsibility. It provides {{a sanctuary for}} the celebration of weddings and baptisms and offers comfort with terminal illness and grieving at memorial and funeral services. Prayer <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a meaningful act that counteracts narcissism and hedonism. Religious observance is a reminder {{there is more to}} life than materialism. However, church attendance and observational service does not lend itself to spiritual evolution and has no transformational power. Additionally, ecclesiastical control <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> political and exploitative, if not corrupt.|$|R
5|$|It is {{possible}} to interpret the Sylvester sequence {{as the result of}} a greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions, that at each step chooses the smallest possible denominator that makes the partial sum of the series be less than one. Alternatively, the terms of the sequence after the first can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the denominators of the odd greedy expansion of 1/2.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide {{exists in}} about 250 {{crystalline}} forms. The polymorphism of SiC {{is characterized by}} a large family of similar crystalline structures called polytypes. They are variations of the same chemical compound that are identical in two dimensions and differ in the third. Thus, they can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> layers stacked in a certain sequence.|$|E
5|$|The Anatomy Act 1832 {{ended the}} {{dissection}} of murderers, {{and most of}} the animal tortures depicted were outlawed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, so by the 1850s The Four Stages of Cruelty had come to <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a somewhat historical series, though still one with the power to shock, a power it retains for a modern audience.|$|E

50|$|Although Bouchard's 688 goals <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{a modern-day}} record, {{there is a}} debate {{as to whether it}} is the all-time record. Dick Roberge, a forward who played in {{throughout}} the 1950s, 1960's, and 1970's scored 756 career goals in his 18-year career, has also <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> minor-league hockey's all-time goal-scoring leader.|$|R
5|$|The Kingdom of This World {{has a deep}} {{focus on}} the nature of revolution, and the novel itself can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a {{reflection}} of Carpentier's ideological perspective towards revolutions. Carpentier tries to establish the idea that a distinction must be made between revolutions and reactions. While a revolution produces progress, a reaction does not.|$|E
5|$|The end of The Dry Salvages {{starts with}} a {{discussion}} about how people attempt to see the future through various superstitious means. Then the narrator tries to convince the reader that resignation about death is necessary. However, such resignation should <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> pushing the self towards redemption and the eternal life in the next world. By acting properly, one {{would be able to}} overcome life and move towards the next world.|$|E
5|$|The {{same idea}} of using a DAG to {{represent}} a family of paths occurs in the binary decision diagram, a DAG-based data structure for representing binary functions. In a binary decision diagram, each non-sink vertex is labeled {{by the name of}} a binary variable, and each sink and each edge is labeled by a 0 or 1. The function value for any truth assignment to the variables is the value at the sink found by following a path, starting from the single source vertex, that at each non-sink vertex follows the outgoing edge labeled with the value of that vertex's variable. Just as directed acyclic word graphs can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a compressed form of tries, binary decision diagrams can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> compressed forms of decision trees that save space by allowing paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions.|$|E
50|$|Flint <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a Blairite, while Watson <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> having {{close links}} to the trade unions. One party source was {{anonymously}} quoted in the Financial Times as comparing a potential contest between Flint and Watson to the hotly contested 1981 deputy leadership election between Denis Healey and the leftist Tony Benn.|$|R
50|$|As {{a prelude}} to the 2012 Republican primaries, The Algemeiner ranked the party's eight {{candidates}} in order of how good they would be for Israel. Rick Santorum, Michele Bachmann and Newt Gingrich <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the three best candidates for Israel, while Ron Paul <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the least beneficial for Israel's needs.|$|R
50|$|Medieval Christians read Virgils poem as a prophecy of {{the coming}} of Christ. The Augustan Age, {{although}} pre-Christian, <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a golden age preparing {{the world for the}} coming of Christ. The great poets of this age <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a source of revelation and light upon the Christian mysteries to come.|$|R
5|$|These {{polycyclic}} hydrocarbons also {{activate the}} AH receptor, {{but less than}} TCDD and only temporarily. Even many natural compounds present in vegetables cause some activation of the AH receptor. This phenomenon can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> adaptive and beneficial, because it protects the organism from toxic and carcinogenic substances. Excessive and persistent stimulation of AH receptor, however, leads to a multitude of adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|A {{configuration}} in Rule 90 can be partitioned {{into two}} subsets of cells {{that do not}} interact with each other. One of these two subsets consists of the cells in even positions at even time steps and the cells in odd positions in odd time steps. The other subset consists of the cells in even positions at odd time steps and the cells in odd positions at even time steps. Each of these two subsets can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a cellular automaton with only its half of the cells.|$|E
5|$|Admiralty {{law is the}} {{particular}} body of national laws applied to maritime questions and offenses, as the uncertainty of sea voyages has caused the sea to <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a unique jurisdiction since antiquity. Rhodian, Roman, Byzantine, Trani, and Amalfian laws were important influences on the French, Genovese, and Hanseatic codes which established the first English courts of admiralty. Unlike the usual English common law system, the courts of admiralty hewed closer to Continental practice, leaving it open for abuse {{that contributed to the}} American Revolution. The adoption of the present constitution reintroduced admiralty law to the United States, but with a relatively larger sphere for trials by jury.|$|E
5000|$|Second stage: {{good and}} bad <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> different. Because the {{boundaries}} between {{the self and the}} other are not stable yet, the other <b>as</b> a person <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> either all good or all bad, depending on their actions. This also means that thinking about another person as bad implies that the self is bad as well, so it's better to think about the caregiver as a good person, so the self <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> good too. [...] "Bringing together extremely opposite loving and hateful images of the self and of significant others would trigger unbearable anxiety and guilt." ...|$|R
