500|$|The Disney {{version of}} the {{character}} was very well received by film critics, even as some were disturbed (columnist Dorothy Kilgallen for instance urged Disney to not make future villains as scary as the Witch). Stephen Hunter included her being [...] "cool" [...] among the [...] "wonderful truths about Snow White." [...] Janet Maslin wrote the film's Snow White [...] "exists only to be victimized by her wicked stepmother - a far more interesting character. The image of the wicked Queen (initially conceived as a raven-haired glamour girl, and the epitome of late-1930s sophistication) who drinks an aging potion and then shrivels, sprouting warts and claws, turning <b>before</b> <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> from a sexy, voluptuous creature into a frightening old crone, must leave as powerful an impression on the audience as Snow White's chirpy femininity." [...] Similarly, Roger Ebert wrote Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was [...] "not so much about Snow White as {{it was about the}} Seven Dwarfs and the Evil Queen," [...] opining this was the reason it has remained [...] "the ultimate animated masterpiece" [...] by 2001 instead of having been forgotten soon after its premiere in 1937.|$|E
500|$|Early {{reviews of}} [...] "To Autumn" [...] focused {{on it as}} part of Keats's {{collection}} of poems Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems. An anonymous critic in the July 1820 Monthly Review claimed, [...] "this writer is very rich both in imagination and fancy; and even a superabundance of the latter faculty is displayed in his lines 'On Autumn,' which bring the reality of nature more <b>before</b> <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> than almost any description that we remember. [...] If we did not fear that, young as is Mr K., his peculiarities are fixed beyond all the power of criticism to remove, we would exhort him to become somewhat less strikingly original,—to be less fond of the folly of too new or too old phrases,—and to believe that poetry does not consist in either the one or the other." [...] Josiah Conder in the September 1820 Eclectic Review mentioned, [...] "One naturally turns first to the shorter pieces, in order to taste the flavour of the poetry. The following ode to Autumn is no unfavourable specimen." [...] An anonymous reviewer in The Edinburgh Magazine for October 1820 added to a discussion of some of Keats's longer poems the afterthought that [...] "The ode to 'Fancy,' and the ode to 'Autumn,' also have great merit." ...|$|E

[...] "No other Soviet actress could have played Assol. Her eyes, her profile, her thin arms... her flying gate – she was a real-life dream-girl," [...] actress Natalya Seleznyova remembered. The young girl's slight clumsiness looked natural on screen, while her strengths – 'gracefulness', 'youthful charms' and an 'aura of other-worldliness' – went undisputed, according to critic L.Nekhoroshev. [...] "It {{was as if a}} young flower blossomed <b>before</b> <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> in the Soviet cinema," [...] critic Andrei Plakhov recalled years later.

2500|$|Positive {{analysis}} of the poem came from Leigh Hunt, in the 21 October 1821 Examiner when Hunt wrote a piece on Coleridge {{as part of his}} [...] "Sketches of the Living Poets" [...] series. When coming to [...] "Kubla Khan", he pointed out: [...] "instead of being content to have written finely under the influence of laudanum, recommends 'Kubla-Khan' to his readers, not as a poem, but as 'a psychological curiosity' ... Every lover of books, scholar or not, who knows what it is to have his quarto open against a loaf at his tea ... ought to be in possession of Mr. Coleridge's poems, if it is only for 'Christabel', 'Kubla Khan', and the 'Ancient Mariner'." [...] When talking about the poem on its own, Hunt claimed it [...] "is a voice and a vision, an everlasting tune in our mouths, a dream fit for Cambuscan and all his poets, a dance of pictures such as Giotto or Cimabue, revived and re-inspired, would have made for a Storie of Old Tartarie, a piece of the invisible world made visible by a sun at midnight and sliding <b>before</b> <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> ... Justly is it thought that to be able to present such images as these to the mind, is to realise the world they speak of. We could repeat such verses as the following down a green glade, a whole summer's morning". The work went without major notice until John Bowring reviewed Coleridge's Poetical Works for the January 1830 Westminster Review. When discussing the work along with the origins of the poem, Bowring stated, [...] "The tale is extraordinary, but 'Kubla Khan' is much more valuable on another account, which is, that of its melodious versification. It is perfect music. The effect could scarcely have been more satisfactory to the ear had every syllable been selected merely for the sake of its sound. And yet there is throughout a close correspondence between the metre, the march of the verse, and the imagery which the words describe." [...] When concluding about the work, he declared, [...] "The elements of this melody are only the common and well-known ones of English versification; our author is always felicitous in their management, but no where has he blended them in so perfect a combination as in this instance." [...] Another emphasis on the musicality of the poem came in August 1834, with Henry Nelson Coleridge's analysis in the Quarterly Review: [...] "In some of the smaller pieces, as the conclusion of the 'Kubla Khan', for example, not only the lines by themselves are musical, but the whole passage sounds all at once as an outburst or crash of harps in the still air of autumn. The verses seem as if played to the ear upon some unseen instrument. And the poet's manner of reciting verse is similar." ...|$|E
