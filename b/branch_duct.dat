The damper pressure loss characteristics and the interactions between the damper blade and shaft have been studied at various damper width ratios {{to take account of}} the damper leakage effects. At damper angles > 10 °, the damper pressure loss characteristics determined for damper -width ratios of 0. 5 to 1. 414 are found to be independent of the shaft sizes for typical rectangular and circular shafts with blockage area ratios ≤ 0. 16. The damper pressure loss coefficients are observed to have collapsed onto a single curve within a ± 10 % accuracy for damper width ratios of 0. 9 to 1. 414. By applying this relationship to square, flat airtight dampers in square <b>branch</b> <b>ducts,</b> the desired flow characteristics for <b>branch</b> <b>ducts</b> fitted with proportional damper controller-actuators can be achieved within a maximum deviation of ± 10 %. This helps solve the nonlinearity problem in the installed damper characteristics for large, complex, variable air volume systems having <b>branch</b> <b>ducts</b> with different resistances.

However, histological evidence that PanIN- 3 invades beyond the basement membrane of pancreatic ductal epithelium, that is, the moment PanIN- 3 becomes IDC, has not been captured yet.

METHODS: During a 17 -year period, 99 successive IPMN patients (52 men, 47 women; mean age, 64 years) were included and divided into two groups for further comparison: one group had <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMN, whereas the other had mixed IPMN. RESULTS: Patients from the mixed IPMN group (n = 52) displayed a greater rate of symptoms (83 % vs 55 %, P = 0. 004), pancreatic resection (67 % vs 38 %, P = 0. 007), malignancy (35 % vs 13 %, P = 0. 017) and death (15 % vs 4 %, P = 0. 09) than those from the <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMN group. A 38 -month follow up of non-operated, symptom-free patients confirmed that more than 85 % of <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMN patients were asymptomatic without evidence of malignancy.

30|$|Detection of intraductal {{papillary}} mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of {{the pancreas}} {{has been increasing}} due to recent advances in imaging. IPMNs can be malignant and undergo transformation from an adenoma to invasive carcinoma. International consensus guidelines from 2006 [1] and recently updated in 2012 [2] recommend surgical resection of main duct IPMNs due to {{a high risk of}} malignancy, ranging from 60 % to 100 %. On the other hand, <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMNs have lower rate of malignancy (6 % to 51 %) [3 - 5], although surgical resection should be recommended if any factors indicating malignancy are present. Large mural nodules are associated with a higher risk of malignancy.

30|$|Intraductal {{papillary}} mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a low-grade malignancy {{that more}} frequently occurs in elderly {{patients with a}} male predominance (the ‘grandfather’ tumour).

There is resultant excess mucin production and progressive dilatation of the main pancreatic duct or cystic dilatation of the <b>branch</b> <b>ducts.</b> These lesions frequently present with pancreatitis, abdominal pain or jaundice [24].|$|R
30|$|Several {{recent studies}} {{reported}} {{that the size of}} mural nodules was a more significant malignant factor than tumor size for predicting the malignancy of <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMNs. For the prediction, the cutoff values for mural nodule size were 5 to 10  mm [9 - 12]. In addition, the MPD size, high serum CEA and carbohydrate antigen 19 – 9 levels, and high CEA levels in the pancreatic juice have been reported to be predictive factors for malignancy of <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMNs [11, 13, 14]. However, it is still impossible to detect all malignant cases, even after examination for these factors and the use of recent imaging modalities. EUS is very useful for identifying small lesions in the pancreas and a helpful modality for the diagnostic evaluation of <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMNs [12, 15]. Furthermore, the mural nodule size of <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMNs detected using EUS was a reliable predictive factor for malignancy [12]. Magnetic resonance imaging is also well suited for the detection of pancreatic lesions, including IPMNs [16]. There have also been meta-analyses on these tools for differentiating malignant and benign IPMNs. Cytology based on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was reported to have a high specificity (97.2 %) but a poor sensitivity (35.1 %) for distinguishing benign IPMNs from malignant IPMNs [17]. The level of cyst fluid CEA was mostly ineffective in differentiating malignancy; sensitivity was 65 %, while specificity was 66 % [18]. In histology, expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase was strongly associated with malignant transformation in IPMNs [19].|$|E
40|$|Although {{considerable}} {{progress has}} been made in our understanding of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas, some issues still remain to be resolved.

The preoperative distinction of <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMNs from nonmucinous cysts should be further investigated so that potentially malignant lesions can be identified and management strategies guided effectively.

With regard to the diagnosis of malignancy in <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMNs, criteria for identifying malignancy need to be re-evaluated. The presence of mural nodules is a very reliable predictor; however, controversy exists over the value of size as a reliable indicator. Criteria with increased specificity are needed, perhaps including histological subtype of lesion, to reduce the false-positive rate of the present criteria.

30|$|IPMNs are an {{increasingly}} recognized entity representing {{a spectrum of}} benign and malignant neoplasms of the pancreas. While {{there is a general}} consensus that all main duct IPMNs should be resected, the indications for resection of <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMNs remain controversial because of their lower tendency for malignancy. The guidelines include a flowchart covering the suggested surgical resection and follow-up procedures for <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMNs. Recent guidelines [2] recommended that surgical resection should be considered without further testing if a patient with a cystic lesion of the pancreas has obstructive jaundice, an enhancing solid component within the cyst, or dilation of the MPD to ≥ 10  mm. According to the most recent guidelines, surgical resection was therefore required in this case due to the presence of an enhanced mural nodule. Moreover, older guidelines [1] recommended that resection should be performed if any of the following five factors are present: a cyst > 3  cm in diameter, mural nodules, MPD dilation to > 6  mm, positive cytology, or symptoms attributable to the tumor. Nagai et al. [6] evaluated the usefulness of these guidelines in <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMN and reported a high sensitivity (97.3 %) but low specificity (29.8 %) for predicting malignancy in <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMN according to these guidelines. Furthermore, as patients presented with more factors, there was an increase in the specificity and positive predictive value but a decrease in sensitivity and negative value of the guidelines for making a preoperative diagnosis of malignancy. Although preoperative imaging, such as EUS and MRCP, showed that the case presented here had four of the factors described in the previous guidelines, histology indicated that the tumor was an IPMA.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{analyzed}} clinicopathologic and imaging {{features and}} {{the prognosis of}} intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (IPMT) of the pancreas to identify imaging findings indicative of malignancy and to establish the optimal treatment strategy. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: In IPMT, preoperative differentiation between adenoma and adenocarcinoma is often difficult. Appropriate treatment based on pathologic study and surgical outcome has not been adequately documented. METHODS: Forty-one patients with IPMT underwent surgery; 15 with adenoma and 26 with adenocarcinoma; main duct type in 13, combined type in 12, and <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> type in 16. RESULTS: In malignant IPMT, deep invasion was found in 62 % and lymph node metastasis in 23 % (peripancreatic nodes in 19 % and distant nodes in 4 %). Tumors with mural nodules (86 %) had a significantly higher incidence of carcinoma than tumors without nodules (37 %). IPMT with a main pancreatic duct > or = 15 mm or tumor diameter > or = 30 mm (<b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> type) showed a high prevalence of adenocarcinoma. Main duct (54 %) and combined (58 %) type tumor, and tumors with mural nodules (64 %) often showed invasion. All five <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> tumors less than 30 mm without nodules were adenomas. However, imaging studies could not definitely distinguish adenocarcinomas from adenomas. Complete resection was possible for all adenomas and 88 % of adenocarcinomas. Five-year survival rates for patients with adenomas and adenocarcinomas were 100 % and 82 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: IPMT has a favorable prognosis, regardless of deep invasion or node metastasis. IPMT requires peripancreatic node dissection in addition to complete tumor excision. Node dissection may be omitted for <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> tumors less than 30 mm without mural nodules...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{biological}} behaviour of <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) by evaluating serial changes at magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Fifty-two patients with a diagnosis of <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMN based on either endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (9 / 52) and/or MRCP examination (43 / 52), were followed up over a mean period of 31. 2 months (range 12 – 108). All imaging data were retrospectively reviewed by two radiologists in order to evaluate serial changes in the maximum diameter of the cystic lesion, in the presence of main pancreatic duct dilatation (MPD), and filling defects within the lesion.

Elevated serum CEA and CA 125 are also associated with malignant lesions [18]. The best predictor of malignant potential, however, is tumour location, with the main duct type having a 70 % chance of harbouring malignancy compared with 25 % for the <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> type [29]. All main duct type IPMN are recommended for resection, whereas <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> type IPMN less than 3  cm in size and lacking mural nodules could potentially be managed conservatively [18].|$|E

No financial relationships relevant to the content {{of this article}} have been disclosed by the authors or independent peer reviewers. Pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) rank among the most common cystic tumors of the pancreas. For a long time they were misdiagnosed as mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, ductal adenocarcinoma in situ, or chronic pancreatitis. Only in recent years have IPMNs been fully recognized as clinical and pathological entities, although their origin and molecular pathogenesis remain poorly understood. IPMNs are precursors of inva-sive carcinomas. When resected in a preinvasive state pa-tient prognosis is excellent, and even when they are already invasive, patient prognosis is more favorable than with ductal adenocarcinomas. Subdivision into macroscopic and microscopic subtypes facilitates further patient risk stratification and directly impacts treatment. There are main duct and <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> IPMNs, with the main duct type including the intestinal, pancreatobiliary, and onco-cytic types and the <b>branch</b> <b>duct</b> type solely harboring the gastric type.

40|$|Intraductal {{papillary}} mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is {{a unique}} pancreatic neoplasm developing in the ductal system. Two major histologic subtypes have been reported, that is the gastric type and the intestinal type. However, their histopathologic features, especially those of the gastric type, have not been fully described. To evaluate the features of these two types and refine their differences, we analyzed 80 IPMNs including 50 cases of the gastric type and 30 cases of the intestinal type with mucin immunohistochemistry. By defining a main duct-type lesion as predominantly involving the main pancreatic duct with or without <b>branch</b> <b>ducts,</b> and a <b>branch</b> duct-type lesion as exclusively centered on <b>branch</b> <b>ducts</b> or consisting {{of a collection of}} small cystic lesions, gastric-type IPMNs were mostly branch duct-type lesions (98 %), whereas the intestinal-type IPMNs were usually main duct type (73 %). The histologic grade of the intestinal type was generally higher than that of the gastric type. The intestinal type was also characterized by frequent intraluminal nodular growth, and severe atrophy and fibrosis of the surrounding parenchyma with mucous lake formation. In contrast, pyloric glandlike structures {{at the base of the}} papillae and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) -like complexes were more frequently observed in the gastric type. A significant difference was observed between the gastric type and the intestinal type with regard to all the above features (P< 0. 05). Seven cases (23 %) of the intestinal type were associated with an invasive adenocarcinoma (6 mucinous and 1 ductal), versus only 1 case (2 %) of the gastric type (invasive ductal carcinoma). All cases of both gastric and intestinal types expressed MUC 5 AC; however, high immunolabeling scores for MUC 2 were mostly observed in the intestinal type (P< 0. 05).
