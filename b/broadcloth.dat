5|$|Dunster {{had become}} a centre for woollen and {{clothing}} production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and {{a particular kind of}} kersey or <b>broadcloth</b> became known as 'Dunsters'.

5|$|In this period, one of {{the major}} {{incentives}} for the growth of Transylvanian towns was the trade with Wallachia and Moldavia. For instance, Braşov was granted a staple right in 1369 with respect to the trade in cloth from Poland or Germany. Thereafter, foreign merchants had to sell their most sought-after merchandise, <b>broadcloth</b> to the tradesmen of Braşov who resold it in Wallachia in exchange for animals, cotton, wax and honey.|$|E

The prosperity of Dunster was based on the wool trade, with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the Priory Church of St George and provide other amenities. By the 15th century the importance of the town was declining particularly due to the silting up of the harbour. The Luttrell's wanted to maintain the importance as a market and in 1609 George Luttrell, of the Luttrell family constructed the market to shelter traders and their wares from the rain and provide more security for their wares. The exact date of construction is debated and a variety of dates are given in different sources, however 1609 is considered the most likely.|$|E

60|$|This {{resemblance}} was, in truth, {{the circumstance}} on which Mr. Esmond's scheme was founded; and having secured Frank's secrecy and enthusiasm, he left {{him to continue}} his journey, and see the other personages on whom its success depended.

25|$|People {{who choose}} to buy their dress may opt for finer fabrics, such as poplin, grosgrain, percale, cotton, wool, cassimere, <b>broadcloth,</b> Russell cord, or corded/ribbed material. For silk, there are a range of types {{including}} artificial silk/rayon, Ottoman (i.e. ribbed or corded silk), taffeta, satin, alpaca, true silk, shot silk, or a mixture. Pure Ottoman silk is rarely used except for official gowns, as it is very expensive. Some gowns may be trimmed with gimp lace, cords, buttons, {{or other forms of}} decoration.|$|E
25|$|Standard fibres {{used for}} the frock coat {{included}} wool and vicuña. The most common weave was known as <b>broadcloth.</b> The standard colour of a frock coat was solid black, but later, in the Victorian era, charcoal grey became an acceptable but less common alternative and Midnight Blue was an even rarer alternative colour. For business and festive occasions the revers was lined with black silk facings (either satin or grosgrain). For funerals black frock coats without self-faced revers were worn with a matching black waistcoat.|$|E
60|$|It {{was curious}} {{to listen to}} the various hints and opinings thrown out by the sailors at the {{occasional}} glimpses they had of this collection of silks, velvets, <b>broadcloths,</b> and satins. I do not know exactly what they thought Harry had been; but they seemed unanimous in believing that, by abandoning his country, Harry had left more room for the gamblers. Jackson even asked him to lift up the lower hem of his browsers, to test the color of his calves.|$|R
5000|$|The many {{different}} English cloths {{produced in the}} Tudor period were dominated by <b>broadcloths</b> and kersies, and current evidence shows Winchcombe producing kersey cloths on an industrial scale: over 6,000 cloths {{each year in the}} 1540s. Each kersey was about a yard (0.9m.) wide, and 17-18 yards long. [...] The scale of his production is also indicated by his purchase of dyes: woad was his most important dye, frequently delivered by the cartload. One order survives for 541 cwt., or over 27 tons of woad.|$|R

25|$|The new {{custom-built}} Imperial sedan {{was based}} on the Chrysler New Yorker. It shared the same trim, but had a canvas-covered roof and leather and <b>broadcloth</b> Imperial upholstery. These features were installed by Derham, on the all new postwar Chrysler sheetmetal. Early 1949 Imperial Crowns were actually leftover 1948s. The really new models didn't arrive until March, 1949. Their styling was sleeker than previous models, yet conservative. Fewer, but heavier bars were used in the cross-hatched grille. The upper and center horizontal pieces wrapped around the front fenders. Rocker panel moldings, rear fender stoneguards, full length lower window trim and horizontal chrome strips on the rear fenders, and from the headlights to about halfway across the front doors, were used to decorate the side body.|$|E
25|$|Yarns {{from these}} fibers are woven into {{a variety of}} {{different}} weaves, the most notable of which include <b>broadcloth,</b> with double the number of warp to weft threads, giving a smooth, formal shirting; twill, where the tucks of the weft do not line up, giving a diagonal pattern, a weave used for most country checked (e.g. Tattersall) shirtings; poplin, with a heavier warp than weft, giving more formal fabric; and Oxford weaves. Plain Oxford or pinpoint Oxford weaves are popular as casual fabrics, so are generally used in combination with a button-down collar, while royal Oxford is versatile enough to be used on both sporty and formal shirts. There are many other weaves or variations on these, including end-on-end patterns, where alternate white and coloured threads are used, giving a mottled appearance, or more exotic weaves, including voile and batiste, which are extremely light fabrics only used for summer shirts or on the unseen parts of formal shirts.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally {{different}} styling during a single model year. The top of the line 1948 Oldsmobile 98 drew heavily from the Futuramic styling concept that would be used on all 1949 Oldsmobiles. Standard equipment on 98s included a solenoid starter, fender skirts, E-Z-l rearview mirror, and foam rubber seat cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual sun visors, and cigarette lighter. Deluxe equipment added front and rear floor mats, Deluxe steering wheel, wheel trim rings, rear seat armrests, and hydraulic window, seat and top controls on all convertibles. Upholstery was either <b>broadcloth</b> or leather. The standard tire size was 6.50 x 16. With the introduction of new postwar styling Custom Cruiser 98 was renamed the Futuramic 98. The Custom Cruiser name would be revived to denote full-size Oldsmobile station wagons in 1971. The new styling was apparently popular with a record 65,235 98s sold, exceeding the number of 90s sold in 1940 for {{the first time}}.|$|E
60|$|Next comes a {{class in}} Arithmetic. These boys are to be the merchants, shop-keepers, and mechanics, of a future period. Hitherto, they have traded only in marbles and apples. Hereafter, some will send vessels to England for <b>broadcloths</b> {{and all sorts of}} {{manufactured}} wares, and to the West Indies for sugar, and rum, and coffee. Others will stand behind counters, and measure tape, and ribbon, and cambric, by the yard. Others will upheave the blacksmith’s hammer, or drive the plane over the carpenter’s bench, or take the lapstone and the awl, and learn the trade of shoe-making. Many will follow the sea, and become bold, rough sea-captains.|$|R
25|$|By the 14th century Birmingham {{seems to}} have been {{established}} as a particular centre of the wool trade. Two Birmingham merchants represented Warwickshire at the council held in York in 1322 to discuss the standardisation of wool staples, and others attended the Westminster wool merchants assemblies of 1340, 1342 and 1343, a period when at least one Birmingham merchant was trading considerable amounts of wool with continental Europe. Aulnage records for 1397 give some indication of the size of Birmingham's textile trade at the time, the 44 <b>broadcloths</b> sold being {{a tiny fraction of the}} 3,000 sold in the major textile centre of Coventry, but making up almost a third of the trade of the rest of Warwickshire.|$|R
60|$|More treacherous than snow, perhaps, colder at heart, {{and harder}} to melt, Blandois of Paris by degrees passed out of her mind, as they came down into the softer regions. Again the sun was warm, again the streams {{descending}} from glaciers and snowy caverns were refreshing to drink at, again they came among the pine-trees, the rocky rivulets, the verdant heights and dales, the wooden chalets and rough zigzag fences of Swiss country. Sometimes the way so widened {{that she and her}} father could ride abreast. And then to look at him, handsomely clothed in his fur and <b>broadcloths,</b> rich, free, numerously served and attended, his eyes roving far away among the glories of the landscape, no miserable screen before them to darken his sight and cast its shadow on him, was enough.|$|R
500|$|The {{end of the}} Hundred Years War in 1453 {{meant that}} Britain, and thus Bristol, lost its access to Gascon wines and so imports of Spanish and Portuguese wines increased.

500|$|The women embroiderers of Bethlehem {{were known}} for their bridalwear. Bethlehem {{embroidery}} was renowned for its [...] "strong overall effect of colors and metallic brilliance." [...] Less formal dresses were made of indigo fabric with a sleeveless coat (bisht) from locally woven wool worn over top. Dresses for special occasions were made of striped silk with winged sleeves with a short taqsireh jacket known as the Bethlehem jacket. The taqsireh was made of velvet or <b>broadcloth,</b> usually with heavy embroidery.|$|E

Chiefly, however, beyond the urban centres of the Burmese lowlands, the Panthays continued their involvement in the caravan trade with Yunnan, transporting silk, tea, metal goods and foodstuffs (eggs, fruit, nut and even the renowned Yunnanese hams (doubtless for consumption by their Han fellow countrymen) from China to Burma, and carrying back European manufactured goods, <b>broadcloths,</b> specialised foodstuffs (edible birds nests, sea slugs) and above all raw cotton, to Yunnan.|$|R
60|$|Castlewood, I have said, {{was born}} in the same year as the Prince of Wales; had not a little of the prince’s air, height, and figure; and, {{especially}} since he had seen the Chevalier de St. George on the occasion before named, took no small pride in his resemblance to a person so illustrious; which likeness he increased by all the means in his power, wearing fair brown periwigs, such as the prince wore, and ribbons, and so forth, of the chevalier’s colour. This resemblance was, in truth, the circumstance on which Mr. Esmond’s scheme was founded; and, having secured Frank’s secrecy and enthusiasm, he left him to continue his journey, and see the other personages on whom its success depended.

Hence it comes, in a way not very blamable, that many people have been so engrossed with what can be got from abroad that they have neglected to inquire what can be found at home: they have supposed, of course, that to get a decent watch they must send to Geneva or to London; that to get thoroughly good carpets they must have the English manufacture; that a really tasteful wall-paper could be found only in Paris; and that flannels and <b>broadcloths</b> could come only from France, Great Britain, or Germany." ...|$|R
500|$|A few minor quarrels {{passed between}} Marshall and Clay {{early in the}} session, but the {{relative}} peace dissolved in December 1808 when Clay introduced a resolution calling for {{all members of the}} General Assembly to wear [...] "homespun" [...] garments as a means of encouraging local manufacturing and reducing British imports. Although Clay typically wore finer garments than Marshall, {{for the duration of the}} debate on his motion, Clay wore simple homemade clothes. Marshall regarded the measure as demagoguery and employed a tailor to make him a suit of British <b>broadcloth</b> to wear on the House floor. The two men exchanged insults on the House floor and would have commenced a physical altercation if not for Riffe's intervention. Instead, on January 4, 1809, Clay challenged Marshall to a duel, which he quickly accepted.|$|E
2500|$|Wool was {{the most}} popular fabric for all classes by far, {{followed}} by linen and hemp. [...] Wool fabrics were available {{in a wide range of}} qualities, from rough undyed cloth to fine, dense <b>broadcloth</b> with a velvety nap. High-value <b>broadcloth</b> was a backbone of the English economy and was exported throughout Europe. [...] Wool fabrics were dyed in rich colours, notably reds, greens, golds, and blues, although the actual blue colour achievable with dyeing with woad (and less frequently indigo) could not match the characteristic rich lapis lazuli pigment blues depicted in contemporary illuminated manuscripts such as the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry.|$|E

Like an experienced old-wife too, his digits had become so expert and conscientious, that his eyes left them alone; deeming optic supervision unnecessary. And on this trip of ours, when not otherwise engaged, he was quite as busy with his fingers as ever: unraveling old Cape Horn hose, for yarn wherewith to darn our woolen frocks; with great patches from the skirts of a condemned reefing jacket, panneling the seats of our [...] "ducks;" [...] in short, veneering our broken garments with all manner of choice old <b>broadcloths.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1604, an {{epidemic}} of the plague arrived in Melford and 119 people died between the months of May and September. [...] During the English Civil War, a Puritan mob of over one thousand arrived in Melford pursuing Elizabeth Savage, Countess Rivers, a staunch Catholic and Royalist, from her property in St Osyth to her Suffolk estate at Melford Hall. The hall was sacked and plundered and the Countess fled to Bury St Edmunds, then to London where eventually she was imprisoned for debt and died a pauper. By {{the end of the}} 17th century, cloth production had once again become important in the area as many new entrepreneurs started to produce a range of materials known as 'Bays and Says', similar to baize and serge. These were lighter, cheaper types of cloth than the traditional woollen <b>broadcloths</b> that had been made in the 15th and 16th centuries but, once again, many of the cloth merchants became extremely wealthy and for some years prosperity returned to Melford.|$|R
60|$|An {{offer was}} {{accordingly}} made of ten months' arrears in cash, {{five months in}} silks and woolen cloths, and the rest in promises to be fulfilled within a few days.

Carousing and merry making went on {{at the expense of}} the citizens, and after suffering for some weeks from the extortions and annoyance of the soldiers, the 400,000 crowns demanded by Requesens were paid over, and the soldiers received all their pay due either in money or goods. A great banquet was held by the whole mass of soldiery, and there was a scene of furious revelry. The soldiers arrayed themselves in costumes cut from the materials they had just received. <b>Broadcloths,</b> silks, satins, and gold embroidered brocades were hung in fantastic drapery over their ragged garments, and when the banquet was finished gambling began.|$|R
