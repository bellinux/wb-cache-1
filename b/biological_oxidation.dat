25|$|Most <b>biological</b> <b>oxidation</b> {{processes}} for treating industrial wastewaters {{have in common}} the use of oxygen (or air) and microbial action. Surface-aerated basins achieve 80 to 90% removal of BOD with retention times of 1 to 10 days.

25|$|In an aerated basin system, the aerators provide two functions: they {{transfer}} {{air into}} the basins required by the <b>biological</b> <b>oxidation</b> reactions, and they provide the mixing required for dispersing the air and for contacting the reactants (that is, oxygen, wastewater and microbes). Typically, the floating surface aerators are rated to deliver the amount of air equivalent to 1.8 to 2.7kg O2/kWh. However, they do not provide as good mixing as is normally achieved in activated sludge systems and therefore aerated basins do not achieve the same performance level as activated sludge units.|$|E
25|$|In older {{plants and}} those {{receiving}} variable loadings, trickling filter beds are used where the settled sewage liquor is spread {{onto the surface}} of a bed made up of coke (carbonized coal), limestone chips or specially fabricated plastic media. Such media must have large surface areas to support the biofilms that form. The liquor is typically distributed through perforated spray arms. The distributed liquor trickles through the bed and is collected in drains at the base. These drains also provide a source of air which percolates up through the bed, keeping it aerobic. Biofilms of bacteria, protozoa and fungi form on the media’s surfaces and eat or otherwise reduce the organic content. The filter removes {{a small percentage of the}} suspended organic matter, while the majority of the organic matter supports microorganism reproduction and cell growth from the <b>biological</b> <b>oxidation</b> and nitrification taking place in the filter. With this aerobic oxidation and nitrification, the organic solids are converted into biofilm grazed by insect larvae, snails, and worms which help maintain an optimal thickness. Overloading of beds may increase biofilm thickness leading to anaerobic conditions and possible bioclogging of the filter media and ponding on the surface.|$|E

Furthermore, bioscorodite crystals resemble the colour, crystal morphology, iron and arsenic content, structural water of the mineral scorodite. The operational costs related to scorodite bio-crystallization can be reduced at least 50 % compared to chemical precipitation because the use of biological reactions to induce the crystallization of scorodite and the good stability properties of the produced crystals.
