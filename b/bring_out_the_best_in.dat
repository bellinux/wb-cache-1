5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's non-program music, though well-crafted, {{does not}} rise to {{the same level of}} {{inspiration}} as his programmatic works; he needed fantasy to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> him. The First Symphony follows the outlines of Schumann's Fourth extremely closely, and is slighter in its thematic material than his later compositions. The Third Symphony and Sinfonietta each contain a series of variations on less-than-the-best music that can lead to tedium.|$|E
5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> herself.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} a mixed review from Tomas Mureika of Allmusic.

[...] After {{pointing out that the}} album did have some high points, he concluded that the album was, however, forgettable.|$|E

500|$|McG {{described}} the film's theme as [...] "where {{you draw the}} line between machines and humans". The friendship between Marcus—who was executed (for murder) when humanity still ruled the world—and Kyle Reese illustrates how war and suffering can <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> people, such as when they worked together to survive during the Blitz. The title was derived from this second chance given to humanity and to Marcus, in addition to John's efforts to save humanity from the machines. The film's original title was Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins, but this was dropped during filming.|$|E

[...] Richie Unterberger concurred, rating the album four out of five stars, and {{suggesting}} that media-hype of the collapsed Smile project was to blame for Smiley Smiles lackluster reception in the United States. He called it a [...] "rather nifty, if rather slight, effort that's plenty weird". In a 2007 issue of Rolling Stone, Robert Christgau and David Fricke named it one of the 40 essential albums of 1967; Christgau declared: [...] "Towering it's not; some kind of hit it is." [...] In 2001, Spencer Owen of Pitchfork awarded the album a 9.5/10 score, and wrote [...] "Smiley Smile is a near-masterpiece. Without any awareness of Smiles existence, this album could have been a contemporary classic... and although the album isn't anywhere close to the sonic revolution that Sgt. Pepper had already brought, Wilson's innovative production and arrangements still <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> every single track." ...|$|E

2500|$|Adams first {{attracted}} the attention of Thomas Whitfield and Sound of Gospel Records as a lead singer with Houston's Southeast Inspirational Choir affiliated with the Church of God in Christ, under the direction of Carl Preacher, Brenda Waters, and Shirley Joiner.

In 1986, Adams was featured on the Edwin Hawkins Music and Arts Seminar Choir released Give Us Peace, with a performance entitled [...] "My Trust Lies in You". Later, she signed a recording contract with Sound of Gospel which yielded her first album Just As I Am in 1987. In 1990, she was discovered by producer/keyboardist Ben Tankard, and signed to his independent label Tribute Records and released Through The Storm. Tankard's goal with Tribute Records during this time was to develop an audience for a smoother gospel/jazz sound. He featured Yolanda's jazzy vocals on his album and concept video single [...] "You <b>Bring</b> <b>Out</b> <b>The</b> <b>Best</b> <b>in</b> Me" [...] on his 1994 release Play Me in Your Key.

2500|$|... "For {{the first}} time in my whole career, I'm more {{involved}} than ever before", Tyler said when interviewed about her fifteenth studio album, Wings. As {{the first time}} she became actively involved in the songwriting process of one of her albums, Wings marked a shift in Tyler's career, focusing on mainstream pop music. With her main songwriting team consisting of herself, Paul D. Fitzgerald and Karen Drotar, they crafted two singles, [...] "Louise" [...] and [...] "Celebrate", neither of which were commercially successful when the album was released in mid-2005. For her birthday in 2005, Tyler and her French band performed in La Cigale, Paris, and in Zaragosa, Spain, before an audience of 100,000 people. The concerts were filmed and brought together to be released on a CD (Bonnie Tyler Live) and DVD (Bonnie on Tour) in 2006 and 2007 respectively. Wings was re-released in the United Kingdom in 2006 under the title Celebrate, though the album again failed to chart. Reviews of the album reflected the success of the album, regarding it as a herald that Tyler [...] "should be re-teaming with a producer of Jim Steinman's caliber to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> her inimitable voice", and that the album content fell short of her previous work in the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|The role of cantankerous skipper Charlie Allnutt won Bogart {{his only}} Academy Award in three nominations, for Best Actor in a Leading Role in 1951. Bogart {{considered}} his performance {{to be the}} best of his film career. [...] He had vowed to friends that if he won, his speech would break the convention of thanking everyone in sight. He advised Claire Trevor, when she had been nominated for Key Largo, to [...] "just say you did it all yourself and don't thank anyone". But when Bogart won the Academy Award, which he truly coveted despite his well-advertised disdain for Hollywood, he said [...] "It's {{a long way from the}} Belgian Congo to the stage of this theatre. It's nicer to be here. Thank you very much... No one does it alone. As in tennis, you need a good opponent or partner to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> you.

Despite the thrilling win and the recognition, Bogart later commented, [...] "The way to survive an Oscar is never to try to win another one... too many stars... win it and then figure they have to top themselves... they become afraid to take chances. The result: A lot of dull performances in dull pictures".|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{said little}} to his students, Hoffmann {{was a highly}} esteemed and admired teacher. He tried to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> each member of his class by means of {{challenging}} assignments, which were occasionally work on real commissions. Where he detected talent among young artists he was willing or eager to promote it; Oskar Kokoschka, Egon Schiele and Le Corbusier were the most prominent beneficiaries of his benevolence towards a promising next generation; others strongly influenced by his aesthetic included the American designers Edward H. and Gladys Aschermann and Louise Brigham. German designer Anni Schaad was another of his students. Le Corbusier was offered a job in his office, Schiele was helped financially and Kokoschka was given work in the Wiener Werkstätte. As {{a member of the}} international jury for the competition to design a palace for the League of Nations at Geneva in 1927, he belonged to the minority who voted for Le Corbusier’s project, and the latter always spoke with admiration of his Viennese colleague. Hoffmann had voted for the union of Austria with Germany and, as noted in Tim Bonyhady's [...] "Good Living Street. The fortunes of my Viennese family" [...] (2011), the architect was admired by the Nazis who appointed him a Special Commissioner for Viennese Arts and Crafts and commissioned him to remodel the former German embassy building into the [...] "Haus der Wehrmacht" [...] for army officers. Following its use by the British Government from 1945 to 1955 it was demolished. [...] Hoffmann died in Vienna, aged 85.|$|E

He added that the pair share a [...] "tempestuous relationship, even if it's also very sweet". On Darren's feelings for Nancy, Dawson said: [...] "He's besotted with her. He feels she's good for him and that he almost doesn't deserve her. He feels like a bit of a failure and Nancy is this strong woman who's organised and everything Darren isn't". Dawson felt that Nancy is the love of Darren's life and that she had helped Darren mature. Dawson said that Darren and Nancy have [...] "know each other for a long time" [...] and that they [...] "work well together".|$|E
