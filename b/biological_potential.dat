As in the previous year the chemical synthesis and medicinal exploration of modified nucleoside monophosphates and triphosphates are divided into sections relating to the nucleobase and sugar.

25|$|None {{of these}} systems are perfect. For example, they are {{unreliable}} at extremes of age (e.g. neonates, infants or the very elderly). Secondly, certain agents, such as nitrous oxide, may produce anesthesia without reducing {{the value of the}} depth monitor. This is because the molecular action of these agents (NMDA receptor antagonists) differs from that of more conventional agents, and they suppress cortical EEG activity less. Thirdly, they are prone to interference from other <b>biological</b> <b>potentials</b> (such as EMG), or external electrical signals (such as electrosurgery). This means that the technology that will reliably monitor depth of anesthesia for every patient and every anesthetic does not yet exist.|$|R
5000|$|Gender {{roles are}} both {{restrictive}} and opportunistic, whereby they dictate an individual's potential through their identification as male or female. In the Western context, {{this can be}} seen particularly through the historic gendered division of labour where men and women are fit into different professional roles dictated by their physical capabilities, typically via sex. Vanwesenbeeck suggests that: [...] "... It's not the <b>biological</b> <b>potential,</b> or sex, per se that causes gender (role) differences to emerge, but the way society differentially treats these potentials" [...] (p. 888). Conformity to these beliefs occurs when others both encourage and accept these behaviours, which in turn, internalizes these gender roles within the minds of men and women throughout a particular group. In a Western context, Eagly & Wood suggest that there are two particular guiding principles of gender role behaviour: ...|$|E
50|$|Owing to its {{non-specific}} cytotoxicity, instability under ambient conditions, {{and relative}} expense {{of isolation and}} manufacture, kedarcidin chromophore has not been investigated rigorously as a therapeutic candidate. However, the recent scientific advances discussed above have served to diminish this last hurdle, as fully synthetic and biosynthetic routes toward scalable kedarcidin production are now within reach. Moreover, with the rising popularity of antibody-drug conjugate therapies, toxicity liabilities may be mitigated through targeted delivery of this potent cytotoxin, potentially enabling efficient therapies that use minimal quantities of this complex material. The recent development of inotuzumab ozogamicin, a calicheamicin-based antibody-drug conjugate {{for the treatment of}} non-Hodgkin lymphoma, reinforces the potential of enediynes to find critical use in the treatment of human disease. Thus, the <b>biological</b> <b>potential</b> and complex molecular architecture of kedarcidin may likely inspire further scientific inquiry into this substance, and possibly deliver new ordnance in the war against cancer.|$|E
5000|$|In the US, among low-SES groups, genetic {{differences}} {{account for}} a smaller proportion variance in IQ than among higher SES populations.

The same review also points out that adoption studies generally are biased towards including only high and high middle SES adoptive families, meaning that they will tend to overestimate average genetic effects. They also note that studies of adoption from lower-class homes to middle-class homes have shown that such children experience a 12 - 18 pt gain in IQ relative to children who remain in low SES homes.|$|E

5000|$|Primary {{neuronal}} tumors {{occurring in}} the ventricular system {{were considered to be}} rare. Most cases described were of non-neuronal origin such as oligodendroglioma, ependymoma, meningioma, choroid plexus papilloma and giant cell. Neurocytomas were probably historically misdiagnosed as intraventricular oligondedronglioma or clear cell ependymoma prior to this. With its non-aggressive behavior the tumor has often been called [...] "benign central neurocytoma". It is believed to occur in young adults from the neuronal cells of the septum pullicidum and the subependymal cells of the lateral ventricles. Most of the initial incidents reported in the lateral ventricle were benign. However, as more information was gathered the name benign central neurocytoma was started {{to be seen as a}} double misnomer because these tumors are not always benign nor centrally located. Many recent studies suggest that their location, <b>biological</b> <b>potential</b> and clinical behavior are observed be more variable than previously thought. Recent studies indicate their uncommon location, aggressive biological behavior and frequent recurrences following after surgical resection have generated significant interest in various treatment modalities and also in their terminology, lineage potential and molecular regulation.|$|E
50|$|The {{healing of}} injured tissue {{involves}} a complex series of natural processes within the body. Growth factors {{play a key}} role in this respect, as they initiate and regulate these complex processes. Many of these growth factors are released by thrombocytes that are contained in the blood and activated in the event of injury. As injury or inflammation involves the destruction of tissue or cells, growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are released. These are involved in cellular processes that promote healing and are associated with tissue growth. Accordingly, they initiate the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cell types (such as osteoblasts and chondroblasts), promote matrix formation through the production of collagen and proteoglycan, and stimulate angiogenesis. This is in contrast to the immune response that is regulated by leukocytes/neutrophils and involved in the reduction of damaged tissue, and that counteracts possible infection with free radicals (Reactive Oxygen Species, ROS), proteases and antimicrobial peptides. However, these have the <b>biological</b> <b>potential</b> to also damage healthy tissue. By adding ACP at the treatment site, an increased concentration of thrombocytes (2 - 3 times higher than that of whole blood) is applied with neutrophils almost entirely absent. This supports the natural process of healing within the body, i.e. the formation of blood vessels, new cells and tissue, while inhibiting painful inflammation.|$|E
