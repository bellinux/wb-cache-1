5|$|During 31 January the Australian Bureau of Meteorology {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} low, that had developed within the monsoon trough over the western Cape York Peninsula.

The campaign continued into Virginia with light engagements until July 23, in the minor Battle of Manassas Gap, after which Meade abandoned any attempts at pursuit and the two armies took up positions {{across from each other}} on the Rappahannock River.|$|E
5|$|John Palliser {{crossed the}} Rockies through a pass in 1858 {{that led to}} the {{headwaters}} of the Palliser River, a tributary of the Kootenay River now named in his honor. (However, at first, his party referred to it as Palliser's River.) His expedition made it downstream to Columbia Lake, but had some trouble making their way back to Alberta; the return route that they had chosen proved too dangerous to negotiate. After trading for some horses and new supplies from a band of Ktunaxa, they made it <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Rockies later that year through North Kootenay Pass near Lower and Upper Kananaskis Lakes, after traveling up the Elk River.|$|E

5|$|A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), {{whether for}} {{household}} use or a prayer mat. The pattern {{is made by}} winding the weft threads <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> warp threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E
5|$|After {{stalling}} offshore {{for almost}} a day, a mid- to upper-tropospheric trough over the central U.S. slowly pulled Tropical Storm Gordon northward then north-northeastward towards Florida's west coast. The storm made landfall between Ft. Myers and Naples with 50 mph (85 km/h) winds. The eastward component of the storm's movement increased, and Gordon moved northeastward onto the Florida Peninsula at 10 mph (17 km/h). The storm barely weakened as it crossed the landmass keeping its 50 mph (85 km/h) winds. Crossing the peninsula in a mere six hours, the storm continued to pick up speed. Early on November 17, <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> open ocean, the storm's central pressure began to fall. Improved organization was not apparent and wind shear was pulling {{at the core of}} the deep convection when, on November 17, Gordon suddenly spawned 75 mph (120 km/h) winds and was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane.|$|E

5|$|As the ANZAC Mounted Division {{pulled back}} {{to the west bank}} of the Jordan, the Wellingtons {{remained}} behind strengthening the defences at the Ghoraniyeh bridge-head. On 18 April, the regiment, less the 6th Squadron, were part of a brigade force that advanced on the village of Shunet Nimrin. The operation was a deception to convince the Turks that further raids on Amman were imminent. The next day patrols from the regiment located a large Turkish force in the foothills around the village. The brigade positioned as if to attack them, then when they reinforced their position, the brigade withdrew. That night they crossed <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> river and camped outside Jericho. The regiment moved again on 23 April, to camp in the foothills to the south of Jericho.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, during {{pre-production}} for The Dark Knight, Warner Bros. hired {{husband and}} wife screenwriting duo Michelle and Kieran Mulroney to script a Justice League film featuring a younger Batman in a separate franchise. George Miller was hired to direct the following September, with Armie Hammer cast as Batman a month later and Teresa Palmer as Talia al Ghul. Filming had nearly commenced at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, but was pushed <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Writer's Guild of America strike, and once more when the Australian Film Commission denied Warner Bros. a 45 percent tax rebate over lack of Australian actors in the film. Production offices were moved to Vancouver Film Studios in Canada for an expected July 2008 start and a planned summer 2009 theatrical release date, but Warner Bros. ultimately canceled Justice League following the success of The Dark Knight. Hammer's option on his contract lapsed and the studio was more willing to proceed with Christopher Nolan to finish his trilogy separately with The Dark Knight Rises.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1941, the 6th Division was {{dispatched}} to Greece, where they fought {{a very brief}} campaign following the German invasion of that country {{in the middle of}} the month. Overwhelmed, the Allied forces were forced <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of several weeks during which the 2/6th took part in several desperate rearguard actions and withdrawals during which the battalion lost 28 men killed and 43 wounded. Finally, they were evacuated by sea at the end of the month, but amidst the confusion a large of the battalion's personnel– 217 personnel from all ranks– were captured, while others were landed on Crete, instead of Alexandria in Egypt, after the ship on which they were sailing, the Costa Rica, was sunk. On Crete, 13 officers and 202 other ranks from the 2/6th were organised into a 17th Brigade composite battalion along with men from the brigade's other battalions less the 2/7th. They subsequently fought unsuccessfully to repulse the German invasion that came in May, after which many more became prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|Increasing {{wind shear}} {{accelerated}} {{the rate of}} weakening, causing Blanca's mid- and low-level circulation centers to decouple. By 18:00UTC on June7, the hurricane degraded to a tropical storm. Around 10:30UTC on June8, Blanca made landfall over Isla Santa Margarita {{off the coast of}} Baja California Sur before striking the mainland, near Puerto Argudin, at 11:15UTC. This marked the earliest known landfall in the state, and peninsula, on record during a calendar year. It surpassed the previous earliest—Tropical Storm Calvin on July8, 1993—by a month. Turning back to the northwest, the system briefly emerged <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean before weakening to a tropical depression. Blanca made its third and final landfall near El Patrocinio around 20:30UTC. With deep convection no longer present, the depression degraded into a remnant low early on June9 over the central Baja California peninsula before dissipating hours later.|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{part of the}} operation was over by 02:15. The intruders had spent over an hour in British airspace. Now the journey <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sea to Germany and the Netherlands was undertaken. The British had jammed German radio beacons and switched on others with the same frequency. It was hoped the move would fool German pilots into landing in Britain in error. Experienced pilots did not fall for the ruse. Still, they had to fly over the sea by dead reckoning. A consequence of this showed that while around only five Ju 88s were lost in combat over England, eight crews were missing, three were killed in crash-landings and had died from their injuries, six crews had baled out 11 aircraft crashed or were damaged on landing.|$|E
5|$|The {{script is}} {{characterized}} by numerous inexplicable mood and personality shifts in characters. In analyzing the film's abrupt tone shifts, Greg Sestero highlighted two scenes in particular. In the first scene, Johnny enters the rooftop {{in the middle of}} a tirade about being accused of domestic abuse, only to become abruptly cheerful upon seeing Mark; a few moments later, he laughs inappropriately upon learning that a friend of Mark's had been severely beaten. On set, Sestero and first assistant director Sandy Schklair repeatedly tried to convince Wiseau that the line should not be delivered as comical, but Wiseau refused to refrain from laughing. In the second instance, occurring a few scenes later, Mark attempts to kill Peter by throwing him off a roof after Peter expresses his belief that Mark is having an affair with Lisa; just as Peter is about to fall to his death, Mark pulls Peter <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> edge of the roof, apologizes, and the two continue their previous conversation with no acknowledgement of what just occurred.|$|E

5|$|Three {{troops from}} B Squadron tried to probe Casoli but failed since the bridges {{over the river}} had been destroyed; a foot patrol formed from the {{squadron}} was sent. C Squadron advanced forward of Elici after it was abandoned by the Axis. The New Zealand Engineers constructed a Bailey bridge over the river, allowing B Squadron to cross on 1 December. The squadron attempted to capture Guardiagrele the next day but was repulsed by anti-tank gunfire. Two troops from C Squadron entered Castelfrentano, joining the tanks of the 18th Armoured Regiment. On 4 December, A and B Squadrons attempted {{to find a way}} through Frisa, working to the right for an easier approach towards Arielli. The division was to attack on the Orsogna road and contain the 26th Panzer Division. On 1 January 1944, B Squadron was sent forward as infantry to take over the sector between San Eusanio and Guardiagrele. It was relieved on 19 January and the regiment moved <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Sangro to another sector.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Delia was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone on record to make landfall {{in the same city}} twice. Forming out of a tropical wave on September1, 1973, Delia gradually strengthened into a tropical storm as it moved north by September3. After reaching this strength, the storm turned more westward and further intensified, nearly attaining hurricane status the next day. The storm peaked with winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a barometric pressure of 986mbar (hPa; 29.11inHg). Several hours later, Delia made landfall near Freeport, Texas; however, the storm began to execute a counterclockwise loop, causing it to move <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico. On September5, the storm made another landfall in Freeport before weakening to a depression. The remnants of Delia eventually dissipated early on September7 over northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|While {{the events}} at {{observation}} post 4 were unfolding, the Iraqi 5th Mechanized Division crossed the Saudi border near observation post 1.

This was then followed by another column with an estimated 29 tanks. One of the column's T-62 tanks was engaged by an anti-tank missile and destroyed. Coalition air support, provided by A-10s and F-16s, engaged the Iraqi drive through observation post 1 and ultimately repulsed the attack <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Kuwaiti border. Aircraft continued to engage the columns throughout the night, until the next morning. Another column of Iraqi tanks, approaching observation post 2, were engaged by aircraft and also repulsed that night.|$|E
