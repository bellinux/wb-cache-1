However, morphological and molecular studies published in 2008 and 2009 indicated that M.manavi as then defined contained five distinct, unrelated species, and M.griveaudi was redefined as a species occurring on both Madagascar and the Comoros.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus mahafaliensis is a <b>bat</b> <b>in</b> {{the genus}} Miniopterus {{that occurs in}} southwestern Madagascar.

5|$|Miniopterus manavi (Manavi long-fingered bat) is a <b>bat</b> <b>in</b> {{the genus}} Miniopterus {{that occurs in}} east-central Madagascar.

A 1995 revision united populations of small Miniopterus from Madagascar and the Comoros as M.manavi, but molecular and morphological studies in 2008 and 2009 showed that this concept of M.manavi in fact included five different species. M.manavi itself was restricted to a few locations in the eastern Central Highlands and populations in the Comoros and northern and western Madagascar were allocated to different species.|$|E
