5000|$|In 1966, General Motors {{designed}} a special [...] engine {{for the production}} Z/28 Camaro in order for it to meet the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Trans-Am Series road racing rules limiting engine displacement to [...] from 1967 to 1969. It {{was the product of}} placing the 283 cu in 3.00 in stroke crankshaft into a [...] bore 327 cu in cylinder-block. The 1967 302 used the same nodular cast-iron crankshaft as the 283, with a forged-steel crank that was also produced. This block is one of three displacements, 302/327/350, that underwent a crankshaft <b>bearing</b> <b>diameter</b> transformation for 1968 when the rod-journal size was increased from the [...] diameter small-journal to a [...] large-journal and a main-journal size that was increased from [...] to [...] The large-journal connecting rods were thicker (heavier) and used 3/8 in diameter cap-bolts to replace the small-journal's 11/32. 1968 blocks were made in 2-bolt and 4-bolt versions with the 4-bolt center-three main caps each fastened by two additional bolts which were supported by the addition of heavier crankcase main-web bulkheads. When the journal size increased to the standard large-journal size, the crankshaft for the 302 was specially built of tufftride-hardened forged 1053-steel and fitted with a high-rpm [...] diameter harmonic balancer. It had a 3/4-length semi-circular windage tray, heat-treated, magnafluxed, shot-peened forged 1038-steel 'pink' connecting rods, floating-pin in `69, forged-aluminum pistons with higher scuff-resistance and better sealing single-moly rings. Its solid-lifter cam, known as the [...] "30-30 Duntov" [...] cam named after its /0.030 in hot intake/exhaust valve-lash and Zora Arkus-Duntov (the first Duntov cam was the / 1957 grind known as the '097, which referred to the last three digits of the casting number) the [...] "Father of the Corvette", was also used in the 1964-1965 carbureted 327/365 and fuel injected 327/375 engines. It used the '202' / valve diameter high-performance 327 double-hump `461 heads, pushrod guide plates, hardened 'blue-stripe' pushrods, edge-orifice lifters to keep more valvetrain oil in the crankcase for high-rpm lubrication, and stiffer valvesprings. In 1967, a new design high-rise cast-aluminum dual-plane intake manifold with larger smoother turn runners was introduced for the Z/28 that the LT-1 350 cu in 1969 Corvette and 1970 Z/28 engines were equipped with until the Q-jet carburetor returned in 1973. Unlike the Corvette, the exhaust manifolds were the more restrictive rear outlet 'log' design to clear the Camaro chassis's front cross-member. It had a chrome oil filler tube {{in the front of the}} intake manifold next to the thermostat housing from 1967 to 1968. The first year had unique chrome valve covers with Chevrolet stamped into them without an engine displacement decal pad. In 1968, the engine had the chrome covers, but without the Chevrolet name, connected to a PCV valve and a chrome [...] drop-base open-element air cleaner assembly fitted with a crankcase breather on a [...] vacuum secondary Holley 4-Bbl carburetor. A 'divorced' exhaust crossover port heated well-choke thermostat coil was used to provide cleaner and faster engine warm-up. Its single-point distributor had an ignition point cam designed to reduce point bounce at high rpm along with a vacuum diaphragm to advance ignition timing at idle and part-throttle for economy and emissions. Pulleys for the balancer, alternator, water-pump, as well as optional power-steering, were deep-groove to retain the drive belt(s) at high rpm. In 1969, the 302 shared the finned cast-aluminum valve covers with the LT-1 350 Corvette engine. Conservatively rated at [...] (SAE gross) at 5800 rpm and [...] at 4800, actual output with its production 11:1 compression ratio was around [...] with [...] primary x 3.00 in secondary Sanderson tubular headers that came in the trunk when ordered with a 1967 Z/28, and associated carburetor main jet and ignition timing tuningneeded. In 1968, the last year for factory headers, they had [...] primaries x 3.00 in secondaries. A stock 1968 Z/28 with the close-ratio transmission, optional transistorized-ignition and 4.88 gear, fitted with little more than the factory cowl plenum cold-air hood induction and headers, was capable of running 12.9 second/ 1/4-mile times on street tires.|$|E

This analysis consists on studying {{the effects of the}} variation of the journal bearings main parameters (radial clearance, journal <b>bearing</b> <b>diameter</b> and journal bearing length) on the journal bearings operating conditions (minimum film thickness, maximum pressure and power loss). The analysis also includes the comparison and selection of the different metallic materials {{that can be used in}} these journal bearings, as well as the selection of the lubrication system groove suitable for the journal bearings used in this kind of application. This sensibility analysis shows that: increasing the radial clearance, the minimum film thickness increases, the maximum pressure remains approximately the same and the power loss decreases; increasing the journal bearing length, the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases; increasing the journal <b>bearing</b> <b>diameter,</b> the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases. At last, it's found that the white metals (Babbitts) are considered the most advantageous and indicated materials for these journal bearings, and that the lubrication system grooves should be circumferential.

The wave journal bearing has a significantly increased load capacity in comparison to the plain journal bearing operating at the same eccentricity.

Three wave bearings are sensitive to the direction of an applied stationary side load. Increasing the number of waves reduces the wave bearing's sensitivity to the direction of the applied load relative to the wave.
