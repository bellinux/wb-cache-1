5000|$|The GNU autotools {{packages}} (i.e. autoconf, automake, and libtool) use {{the notion}} of a <b>build</b> <b>platform,</b> a host platform, and a target platform. The <b>build</b> <b>platform</b> is where the compiler is actually compiled. In most cases, build should be left undefined (it will default from host). The host platform is where the output artifacts from the compiler will be executed. The target platform is used when cross compiling cross compilers, it represents what type of object code the package itself will produce; otherwise the target platform setting is irrelevant. [...] For example, consider cross-compiling a video game that will run on a Dreamcast. The machine where the game is compiled is the host platform while the Dreamcast is the target platform.|$|E

5000|$|The DMLS {{process begins}} with a 3D CAD model whereby a [...]stl file is created {{and sent to the}} machine’s {{computer}} program.

Once this [...] "build file" [...] has been completed, it is [...] "sliced" [...] into the layer thickness the machine will build in and downloaded to the DMLS machine allowing the build to begin. The DMLS machine uses a high-powered 200 watt Yb-fiber optic laser. Inside the build chamber area, there is a material dispensing platform and a <b>build</b> <b>platform</b> along with a recoater blade used to move new powder over the <b>build</b> <b>platform.</b> The technology fuses metal powder into a solid part by melting it locally using the focused laser beam.

50|$|Industrial 3D {{printing}} uses {{additive manufacturing}} technologies to create extremely accurate and repeatable prototypes, from small parts with complex geometries to large, precise patterns. 3D-printed parts are built by rapid stereolithography, {{selective laser sintering}} and {{direct metal laser sintering}} processes, and in a range a plastics and metals. Also, now offering PolyJet, ‭which uses a jetting process where small droplets of liquid photopolymer are sprayed from multiple jets onto a <b>build</b> <b>platform</b> and cured layer by layer.|$|E
5000|$|It is also {{possible}} to print objects [...] "bottom up" [...] by using a vat with a transparent bottom, and focusing the UV or deep-blue polymerization laser upward through {{the bottom of the}} vat. For example, the Form 1 stereolithography machine starts a print by lowering the <b>build</b> <b>platform</b> to touch the bottom of the resin-filled vat, then moving upward the height of one layer. The UV laser then writes the bottom-most layer of the desired part upward through the transparent vat bottom, and the photopolymer hardens selectively where the laser strikes. Then the vat is [...] "rocked", flexing and peeling the bottom of the vat away from the hardened photopolymer; the hardened material detaches {{from the bottom of the}} vat and stays attached to the rising <b>build</b> <b>platform,</b> and new liquid photopolymer flows in from the edges of the partially built part. The UV laser then writes the second-from-bottom layer and repeats the process. An advantage of this bottom-up mode is that the build volume can be much bigger than the vat itself, and only enough photopolymer is needed to keep the bottom of the build vat continuously full of photopolymer.|$|E

50|$|Borosilicate glass {{has become}} the {{material}} of choice for fused deposition modeling (FDM), or fused filament fabrication (FFF), build plates. Its low coefficient of expansion makes borosilicate glass, when used in combination with resistance-heating plates and pads, an ideal material for the heated <b>build</b> <b>platform</b> onto which plastic materials are extruded one layer at a time. The initial layer of build must be placed onto a substantially flat, heated surface to minimize shrinkage of some build materials (ABS, polycarbonate, polyamide, etc.) due to cooling after deposition. The build plate will cycle from room temperature to between 100 °C and 130 °C for each prototype that is built. The temperature, along with various coatings (Kapton tape, painter tape, hair spray, glue stick, ABS+acetone slurry, etc.), ensure that the first layer may be adhered to and remain adhered to the plate, without warping, as the first and subsequent layers cool following extrusion. Subsequently, following the build, the heating elements and plate are allowed to cool. The resulting residual stress formed when the plastic contracts as it cools, while the glass remains relatively dimensionally unchanged due to the low coefficient of thermal expansion, provides a convenient aid in removing the otherwise mechanically bonded plastic from the build plate. In some cases the parts self-separate as the developed stresses overcome the adhesive bond of the build material to the coating material and underlying plate.|$|E
40|$|Selective Laser Melting of Ti 6 Al 4 V {{has already}} transitioned to {{commercial}} exploitation, {{but is still}} coping with two major limitations that restrict a more widespread use. Residual stresses can cause a premature build failure by inducing cracks in bigger parts, and deformations of fine features during the build and of the whole part after removal from the <b>build</b> <b>platform.</b> On the other hand, the ductility of the martensitic α’ microstructure is relatively low. Preheating of the <b>build</b> <b>platform</b> may provide a solution for both problems. It reduces thermal gradients and thus limits the development of residual stresses, but also causes a transformation of the α’ microstructure to a more ductile mixture of α+β. In this research, preheating of the base plate up to 400 °C shows that residual stresses are reduced by 50 %, and a transformation of the microstructure to a α+α’+β mixture. However, pickup of interstitial elements at elevated temperatures during the process leads to an embrittlement, reducing the ductility. Careful control of the atmospheric parameters may eliminate this issue, {{paving the way for}} <b>build</b> <b>platform</b> preheating to solve the current problems with SLM of Ti 6 Al 4 V. status: publishe...|$|E
