5000|$|Iron Age {{wrought iron}} was {{produced}} {{by means of a}} bloomery followed by reheating and hammering. With the type that was common in Sussex a round shallow hearth was dug out, clay hard-packed to line it, then layers of hammered ore and charcoal were put down and the whole lot covered by a clay beehive structure, with holes at the side for the insertion of foot or hand bellows. The material inside the <b>beehive</b> <b>furnace</b> was then ignited and it took two to three days for the process to complete, leaving semi-molten lumps of iron, known as blooms on the hearth. [...] The output from these types of furnace, was very small as everything had to cool down before the iron could be retrieved. [...] The iron so retrieved could then be worked by using the heat and beat technique to form wrought iron implements such as weapons or tools. Around a dozen pre-Roman sites have been found in eastern Sussex, the westernmost being at Crawley.|$|E
5000|$|Modern Populonia {{is located}} within {{a small portion}} of the walled acropolis of a large ancient city, which covered the entire north end of Monte Massoncello, a promontory, its {{northern}} slopes down to the Bay of Baratti, and the shores of the bay, which was its port. The city was an industrial one, smelting copper ore brought from the Colline Metallifere, the [...] "ore-bearing hills" [...] inland, and iron ore from nearby Elba, in <b>beehive</b> blast <b>furnaces.</b> Over the thousand years of its life it came to cover the entire southern shore of the bay with slag, piling it over abandoned residences and cemeteries, until it lost its utility as a metals manufacturer. Then it was abandoned.|$|R
50|$|Bernard Fagg {{undertook}} a controlled evacuation of Taruga in the 1960s, finding both terracotta figurines and iron slag with radiocarbon dates from about {{the fourth and}} third centuries BC. Iron working at the site has now been firmly dated to 600 BC, two hundred years before it began in Katsina-Ala, another Nok center. This is the earliest known date for iron working in Sub-Saharan Africa. It has been speculated that iron smelting technology {{was introduced to the}} region from North Africa, perhaps via Meroe, but it may well have developed indigenously, building on earlier copper-smelting technology in which iron ore was used as a flux. The <b>beehive</b> and cylindrical <b>furnaces</b> of West Africa are quite different in form from those of North Africa and Mesopotamia. The iron workers at Taruga certainly seem to have developed the innovation of pre-heating the air entering the furnace so as to obtain higher temperatures.|$|R
