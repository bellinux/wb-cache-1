Their management is directed towards pain relief achieved with different classes of drugs among which non-steroidal and steroidal anti-inflammatory substances are {{the most frequently used}} agents. Nevertheless, the oral or systemic administration of such drugs is hindered by numerous side effects, which could be overcome by their intra-articular (i-a.) administration as dosage forms capable of gradually releasing the active substance.

40|$|Transformation of {{proteins}} and peptides to fibrillar aggregates rich in beta sheets underlies many diseases, but mechanistic details of these structural transitions are poorly understood. To simulate aggregation, four equivalents of a water-soluble, alpha-helical (65 %) amphipathic peptide (AEQLL-QEAEQLLQEL) were assembled in parallel on an oxazole-containing macrocyclic scaffold. The resulting 4 alpha-helix bundle is monomeric {{and even more}} alpha helical (85 %), {{but it is also}} unstable at pH 4 and undergoes concentration-dependent conversion to beta-sheet aggregates and amyloid fibrils. Fibrils twist and grow with time, remaining flexible like rope (> 1 mu m long, 5 - 50 nm wide) with multiple strings (2 nm), before ageing to matted fibers. At pH 7 the fibrils revert back to soluble monomeric 4 alpha-helix bundles. During alpha -> beta folding we were able to detect soluble 3 (10) helices in solution by using 2 D-NMR, CD and FTIR spectroscopy. This intermediate satisfies the need for peptide elongation, from the compressed a helix to the fully extended beta strand/sheet, and is driven here by 3 (10) -helix aggregation triggered in this case by template-promoted helical bundling and by hydrogen-bonding glutamic acid side chains.

50|$|At {{the peak}} of binding energy, nickel-62 is the most tightly bound nucleus (per nucleon), {{followed}} by iron-58 and iron-56. This is the approximate basic reason why iron and nickel are very common metals in planetary cores, since they are produced profusely as end products in supernovae and {{in the final stages}} of silicon burning in stars. However, it is not binding energy per defined nucleon (as defined above), which controls which exact nuclei are made, because within stars, neutrons are free to convert to protons to release even more energy, per generic nucleon, if the result is a stable nucleus with a larger fraction of protons. In fact, it has been argued that photodisintegration of 62Ni to form 56Fe may be energetically possible in an extremely hot star core, due to this <b>beta</b> decay <b>conversion</b> of neutrons to protons. The conclusion is that at the pressure and temperature conditions in the cores of large stars, energy is released by converting all matter into 56Fe nuclei (ionized atoms). (However, at high temperatures not all matter will be in the lowest energy state.) This energetic maximum should also hold for ambient conditions, say T = 298 K and p = 1 atm, for neutral condensed matter consisting of 56Fe atoms—however, in these conditions nuclei of atoms are inhibited from fusing into the most stable and low energy state of matter.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Several {{radioxenon}} isotopes (¹³¹ᵐXe, ¹³³Xe, ¹³³ᵐXe, ¹³⁵Xe) {{are characteristic}} byproducts of nuclear explosions, {{and due to}} their chemically nonreactive nature can easily escape from tests occurring underground and enter the atmosphere. It {{has been shown that}} by utilizing beta-gamma coincidence techniques, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) can reliably detect the presence of these isotopes in the atmosphere to verify the nuclear nature of clandestine explosions. In an effort to mitigate conversion electron backscatter effects observed in a Two-Element CZT (TECZT) coincidence radioxenon detection system previously designed at Oregon State University, a new prototype beta-gamma coincidence detection system has been developed. The detection system consists of a coplanar CZT detector, an array of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), and a well-type plastic scintillator. Radioactive gas samples are injected via a tube into the plastic scintillator gas cell, the base of which is coupled to the SiPM array for light readout. This scintillator is used to detect the full energy deposition of <b>beta</b> particles and <b>conversion</b> electrons without significantly attenuating gamma and X-rays. A coplanar CZT detector, chosen for its excellent energy resolution, simple readout electronics, and room temperature operation, is positioned beside the scintillator to detect gamma radiation and X-rays that are emitted in coincidence with the <b>beta</b> particles and <b>conversion</b> electrons. The system is directly mounted onto a custom printed circuit board (PCB) for low noise readout using a custom field-programmable gate array (FPGA) -based dual-channel digital pulse processor.

However upon activation of the NLRP 3 inflammasome with ATP, macrophages from young and aged mice were able to efficiently convert and secrete intracellular pro-cytokines as functional cytokines.

40|$|A {{refinement}} of a minimal model for protein folding originally proposed by Imamura is presented. The {{representation of the}} alpha-helix has been improved by adding in explicit modelling of the entire peptide unit. A four-helix bundle consisting of four alpha-helices and three loop regions is generated with the parallel tempering Monte Carlo scheme. Six native states are found for the given sequence, four U-bundle and two Z-bundle states. All six states have energies of E approx - 218 ε and all appear equally {{likely to occur in}} simulation. The highest probability of folding a native state is found to be at a hydrophobic strength of Ch = 0. 8 which agrees with the value of Ch = 0. 7 used by Imamura in his studies of alpha to <b>beta</b> structural <b>conversions.</b> Two folding stages are observed in the temperature spectrum dependent on the magnitude of the hydrophobic strength parameter. The two stages observed as temperature decreases are 1) the hydrophobic energy causes the random coil to collapse into a compact globule 2) the secondary structure starts forming below a temperature of about T = 0. 52 ε/kB. The temperature of the first stage, which corresponds to the characteristic collapse temperature Tθ, is highly dependent on the hydrophobic strength. The temperature of the second stage is constant with respect to hydrophobic strength. Attempts to measure the characteristic folding temperature, Tf, from the structural overlap function proved to be difficult due mostly to the presence of six minima and the complications that arose in the parallel tempering Monte Carlo scheme. However, a rough estimate of Tf is obtained at each hydrophobic strength from a native state density analysis. Tf is found to be significantly lower than Tθ...|$|R

This {{is a continuation of}} earlier work by Hasan et al. (2005). The new features in the present investigation include a quantitative evaluation of the energy transport in the various modes and for different field strengths, as well as the effect of the boundary-layer thickness on wave propagation. We carry out 2 -D MHD numerical simulations of magnetic flux concentrations for strong and moderate magnetic fields. Waves are excited in the tube and ambient medium by a transverse impulsive motion of the lower boundary. The nature of the modes excited depends on the value of <b>beta.</b> Mode <b>conversion</b> occurs in the moderate field case when the fast mode crosses the beta= 1 contour. In the strong field case the fast mode undergoes conversion from predominantly magnetic to predominantly acoustic when waves are leaking from the interior of the flux concentration to the ambient medium. We also estimate the energy fluxes in the acoustic and magnetic modes. The main conclusions of our work are twofold: firstly, for transverse, impulsive excitation, flux tubes/sheets with strong fields are more efficient than those with weak fields in providing acoustic flux to the chromosphere. However, there is insufficient energy in the acoustic flux to balance the chromospheric radiative losses in the network, even for the strong field case. Secondly, the acoustic emission from the interface between the flux concentration and the ambient medium decreases with the width of the boundary layer.

40|$|Cell {{adhesion}} to extracellular matrices {{is mediated}} {{by a set}} of heterodimeric cell surface receptors called integrins that might be the subject of regulation by growth and differentiation factors. We have examined the effect of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) on the expression of the very late antigens or alpha beta 1 group of integrins in human cell lines. The six known members of this family share a common beta 1 subunit but have distinct alpha subunits that confer selective affinity toward type I collagen, fibronectin, laminin, and other as yet unknown cell adhesion proteins. Using a panel of specific antibodies and cDNA probes, we show that in WI- 38 lung fibroblasts TGF-beta 1 elevates concomitantly the expression of alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and beta 1 integrin subunits at the protein and/or mRNA level, their assembly into the corresponding alpha beta 1 complexes, and their exposure on the cell surface. The rate of synthesis of total alpha subunits relative to beta 1 subunit is higher in TGF-beta 1 -treated cells than in control cells. The characteristically slow (t 1 / 2 approximately 10 h) rate of <b>beta</b> 1 <b>conversion</b> from precursor form to mature glycoprotein in untreated cells increases markedly (to t 1 / 2 approximately 3 h) in response to TGF-beta 1. The results suggest that in WI- 38 fibroblasts the beta 1 subunit is synthesized in excess over alpha subunits, and assembly of beta 1 subunits with rate-limiting alpha subunits is required for transit through the Golgi and exposure of alpha beta 1 complex on the cell surface. TGF-beta 1 does not induce the synthesis of integrin subunits that are not expressed in unstimulated cells, such as alpha 4 and alpha 6 subunits in WI- 38 fibroblasts. However, alpha 4 and alpha 6 subunits can be regulated by TGF-beta in those cells that express them. The results suggest that TGF-beta regulates the expression of individual integrin subunits by parallel but independent mechanisms. By modifying the balance of individual alpha beta 1 integrins, TGF-beta 1 might modulate those aspects of cell migration, positioning, and development that are guided by adhesion to extracellular matrices...|$|R

The International Monitoring System (IMS) {{was established to}} verify compliance with the treaty. It consists of several monitoring stations that detect: seismic activities, hydrocoustic activities, infrasound waves, and radionuclide particles and noble gases. Radioxenon detection provides the most robust evidence of a nuclear weapon test. There are four radioxenon isotopes of interest: 131 mXe (t 1 / 2 = 11. 93 days), 133 mXe (t 1 / 2 = 2. 19 days), 133 Xe (t 1 / 2 = 5. 25 days) and 135 Xe (t 1 / 2 = 0. 38 days). All of these radioxenons emit beta and gamma radiation in coincidence or conversion electrons and X-rays in coincidence during their decay process. In this research, a new radioxenon detection system was developed based on Si and CZT detectors. The system is made of the “PIPSBox” silicon gas cell recently developed by Canberra to detect <b>beta</b> and <b>conversion</b> electrons, and two coplanar CZT detectors to detect X-rays and gamma rays. The PIPSBox silicon gas cell offers many advantages such as: (1) increasing the frequency of air sampling at IMS stations because memory effect {{does not affect the}} PIPSBox gas cell like it does with plastic gas cells currently used at IMS stations, (2) reducing the Minimum Detectable Concentration (MDC) for radioxenons due to better energy resolution of silicon, and minimal background interference from previous measurements.

The role of {{internal}} and external reductants in the dopamine beta-monooxygenase (D <b>beta</b> M) -catalyzed <b>conversion</b> of dopamine to norepinephrine has been investigated in resealed chromaffin granule ghosts. The rate of norepinephrine production was not affected by the exclusion of internal ascorbate. The omission of ascorbate from the external medium drastically reduced the norepinephrine production without affecting the net rate of dopamine uptake. In {{the presence of the}} external reductant, the internal ascorbate levels were constant throughout the incubation period. The rate of norepinephrine production was not affected when ghosts were resealed to contain the D beta M reduction site inhibitor, imino-D-glucoascorbate. Ghosts incubated with external imino-D-glucoascorbate reduced the norepinephrine production. The weak D beta M reductant, 6 -amino-L-ascorbic acid, was found to be a good external reductant for granule ghosts. The outcome of the above experiments was not altered when dopamine was replaced with the reductively inactive D beta M substrate, tyramine. These results and the known topology of membrane-bound D beta M disfavor the direct reduction of the enzyme by the external reductant. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that external ascorbate is the sole source of reducing equivalents for D beta M monooxygenation and that internal soluble ascorbate (or dopamine) may not directly reduce or mediate the reduction of membrane-bound D beta M in resealed granule ghosts.

Zeolite catalysis enables high product selectivity and {{is widely used}} due to the high activity, thermal stability, and well-defined crystalline pore structure of zeolites. Moreover, incorporation of metals into the framework of hydrophobic zeolites results in water-tolerant Lewis acids. This thesis discusses the synthesis, characterization, and structure-activity relations of metal-substituted Beta zeolites in the conversion of oxygenates. Chapter 2 discusses the application of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) NMR to characterize natural-abundance Sn-Beta. An indirect use of proton spin diffusion resulted in a 50 -fold signal increase {{and the ability to}} observe natural-abundance ¹¹⁹Sn-Beta in < 24 h. Since DNP NMR only enables efficient detection of spin- 1 / 2 nuclei, a secondary method of adsorbing pyridine on framework metal sites in zeolites permits further characterization of quadrupolar nuclei. Chapter 3 examines how pyridine chemical shift can resolve framework and extraframework metal sites as well as provide a measure of Lewis acidity. Additionally, solid-state NMR offers the ability to quantify the concentrations of these sites. Promoter addition to the active sites of zeolites can further provide cooperative catalysis and tuning of product distribution. Chapter 4 describes the borate-promoted Sn- <b>Beta</b> zeolite-catalyzed <b>conversion</b> of aldoses via an unusual 1, 2 carbon shift mechanism. The addition of a borate promoter to Sn-Beta resulted in a complete shift towards near-equilibrium epimerization product distribution. Chapter 5 further examines the catalytic consequences of varying key reaction parameters such as the borate to sugar ratio, pH, and reaction time. This full factorial experimental design showed that epimerization dominates under neutral conditions and is still active at substoichiometric borate to sugar ratio. This observation suggests that borate is acting pseudo-catalytically potentially through interaction with the Sn site. These findings motivated a detailed mechanistic study, as discussed in Chapter 6. Solid-state NMR proximity measurements in conjunction with directed removal of substrate functionality led to a proposed Bilik-type reaction mechanism involving borate. This body of work contributes to a molecular-level understanding of Lewis acid sites in hydrophobic zeolites. Furthermore, the ability to tailor Lewis acid sites through promoter incorporation can enable novel catalytic reactions. by William Robert Gunther. Thesis: Ph.

The extent of protection afforded to the Tox- strain when induced to adenylylate glutamine synthetase was tested. We concluded that an additional protection mechanism was required. A detoxification activity {{was found in the}} Tox+ strain which opens the beta-lactam ring of T beta L to produce the inactive, open-chain form, tabtoxinine. Whole cells of the Tox+ strain incubated for 24 h with [14 C]T beta L (0. 276 mumol/ 3 X 10 (10) cells) contained [14 C]tabtoxinine (0. 056 mumol), and the medium contained T beta L (0. 226 mumol). Extracts of spheroplasts of the Tox+ stain also converted T beta L to tabtoxinine, whereas extracts of the Tox- strain did not alter T <b>beta</b> L. The <b>conversion</b> was time dependent and stoichiometric and was destroyed by boiling for 30 min or by the addition of 5 mM EDTA. Penicillin, a possible substrate and competitive inhibitor of this lactamase activity, inhibited the <b>conversion</b> of T <b>beta</b> L to tabtoxinine. Periplasmic fluid did not catalyze the <b>conversion</b> of T <b>beta</b> L...|$|R
40|$|Therapeutic phosphonate-based radiopharmaceuticals radiolabeled with <b>beta,</b> alpha and <b>conversion</b> {{electron}} emitting radioisotopes {{have been}} investigated for the targeted treatment of painful bone metastases for > 35 years. We performed a systematic literature search {{and focused on the}} pharmaceutical development, preclinical research and early human studies of these radiopharmaceuticals. The characteristics of an ideal bone-targeting therapeutic radiopharmaceutical are presented and compliance with these criteria by the compounds discussed is verified. The importance of both composition and preparation conditions for the stability and biodistribution of several agents is discussed. Very few studies have described the characterization of these products, although knowledge on the molecular structure is important with respect to in vivo behavior. This review discusses a total of 91 phosphonate-based therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, of which only six agents have progressed to clinical use. Extensive clinical studies have only been described for (186) Re-HEDP, (188) Re-HEDP and (153) Sm-EDTMP. Of these, (153) Sm-EDTMP represents the only compound with worldwide marketing authorization. (177) Lu-EDTMP has recently received approval for clinical use in India. This review illustrates that a thorough understanding of the radiochemistry of these agents is required to design simple and robust preparation and quality control methods, which are needed to fully exploit the potential benefits of these theranostic radiopharmaceuticals. Extensive biodistribution and dosimetry studies are indispensable to provide the portfolios that are required for assessment before human administration is possible. Use of the existing knowledge collected in this review should guide future research efforts and may lead to the approval of new promising agents...|$|R
40|$|The {{micromechanics}} of {{ductile fracture}} has made enormous progress in recent years. This approach, which was mostly {{developed in the}} context of structural integrity analysis, is becoming a key tool for materials scientists to optimize materials fracture properties and forming operations. Micromechanical models allow quantitatively linking fracture properties, microstructure features at multiple lengths scales, and manufacturing conditions. After briefly reviewing the state of the art, this paper illustrates the application of the micromechanics-based methodology by presenting the results of an investigation on the damage resistance of 6 xxx Al produced by extrusion. The presence of coarse, elongated, particles is the key microstructural feature affecting the fracture behaviour of 6 xxx Al. The detrimental elongated beta-type particles are transformed into rounded alpha-type particles by heat treatment. In situ tensile tests revealed that, at ambient temperature, the alpha particles and the beta particles oriented with the long axis perpendicular to the main loading direction undergo interface decohesion, while the beta particles oriented perpendicular to the loading direction break into several fragments. At high temperatures, only interface decohesion is observed. Uniaxial tensile tests on notched and smooth round bars were performed on two different alloys, at different temperatures ranging between 20 degrees C and 600 degrees C, under different loading rates, while systematically varying the content in beta versus alpha particles. The ductility increases with decreasing amount of P beta particles, increasing temperature and strain rates, and decreasing stress triaxiality. A viscoplastic extension of the Gurson model has been developed for capturing the complex hierarchy of damage mechanisms, coupled with viscoplastic and stress state effects. Three populations of voids are modelled while accounting for the different void nucleation mechanisms leading to different initial void aspect ratio. Proper modelling of the initial void aspect ratio and of its evolution with void growth was the key to predict the effect of the <b>beta</b> -> alpha <b>conversion</b> on ductility. The void coalescence criterion takes into account the presence of secondary voids resulting from particle fragmentation. The characteristics of particles entering the model were all measured experimentally. The temperature and rate dependent flow properties of the matrix material have been obtained by inverse modelling. The only fitting parameters are the critical stresses for void nucleation. The model is validated by comparing the predictions to the experimental data involving different relative proportion of alpha and beta particles, temperature, loading rate and stress triaxiality. This type of model opens the path for an "alloy by design" strategy which relates end-use properties to upstream manufacturing operations. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
