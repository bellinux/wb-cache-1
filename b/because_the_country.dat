5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} time, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{participated in}} nine Summer Olympic Games between its début at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England. The only {{occasions}} {{in that period}} which they did not attend was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union, the former because of a boycott relating to the New Zealand national rugby union team touring South Africa, and the latter <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> joined the United States-led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War. The highest number of athletes sent by Malawi to a summer Games is 16 to the 1972 Games and the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. No Malawian athlete has ever won a medal at the Olympics. Malawi participated in the London Summer Olympics from 27 July to 12 August 2012.|$|E

5|$|Malawi first {{competed in}} the Summer Olympics at the 1972 Games in Munich, Germany. They participated on ten {{occasions}} prior to the 2016 Summer Paralympics, where they made their Summer Paralympics debut in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with the expection of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1980 Summer Games in the Soviet Union, the former because of a boycott relating to the New Zealand national rugby union team touring South Africa, and the latter <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> joined the United States-led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War. Malawi intended to make its first appearance in the Summer Paralympics at the 2012 Games in London but withdrew hours before the opening ceremony started {{because of a lack}} of funding. The country participated in the Rio Paralympic Games from 7 to 18 September 2016. Malawi was one of six countries to make their first appearance in the quadrennial event; the others were Aruba, Congo, Somalia, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo. They sent a single middle-distance runner, Taonere Banda, who was announced by the Malawi Paralympics Committee on 4 July, and was occupied by her coach George Luhanga. Banda was the flag bearer for the opening ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Taonere Banda was {{the first}} Malawian Paralympic athlete to compete at the quadrennial event. She {{qualified}} for the games by using a wildcard <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> {{did not have any}} athletes who met the qualification standards. Banda spent the 60 days in the buildup to Rio training for the event, but amenities in Malawi were imperfect and she trained on a dusty, uneven running track without standard defined lanes. She stated that it had been her childhood ambition to represent Malawi at a major international sporting event and this was her sole opportunity to prove her athletic abilities in her event, the 1500 metres (T13). Banda was drawn in the first heat on 8 September. She attacked the first lap aggressively taking up a commanding lead, but her initial speed saw her tire in the latter stages and she lost the lead in the last 600 metres of the race to finish fourth. Banda was later disqualified when she was observed to leave her lane during the heat. Nevertheless, she said that when she returned to Malawi, she would encourage people with disabilities to work hard and participate in sporting events.|$|E
25|$|In certain circumstances, {{it is not}} {{possible}} for the holder of the visa to do this, either <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> does not have a mechanism to prolong visas or, most likely, because the holder of the visa is using a short stay visa to live in a country.|$|E

25|$|The book {{market in}} China {{traditionally}} orders books during book fairs, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> lacks a national book ordering system. In 2006, 6.8 million titles were sold, not including {{an unknown number}} of banned titles, bootleg copies and underground publishing factories. Seven percent of all publishers are located in Shanghai. Because the industry lacks a national distribution system, many titles from publishers in the provinces can only be found there.|$|E
25|$|The {{resistance}} to an entrenched {{bill of rights}} in New Zealand is partly <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> is currently governed by parliamentary sovereignty. Giving the courts the power to strike down Parliament’s legislation would be contrary to the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy. There is also resistance because the protection of human rights is not regarded as the courts’ responsibility, but instead seen as requiring involvement by all branches of government.|$|E

Subsequent oil and gas discoveries in the Gulf of Thailand and in the South China Sea, however, could spark renewed interest in Cambodia's offshore area, especially <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> is on the same continental shelf as its Southeast Asian oil-producing neighbors.|$|E

25|$|Worried about Hungary's {{increasing}} {{reliance on}} Germany, Admiral Horthy forced Bárdossy to resign and replaced him with Miklós Kállay, a veteran conservative of Bethlen's government. Kállay continued Bárdossy's policy of supporting Germany against the Red Army while also initiating {{negotiations with the}} Western Allies. Hungarian participation in Operation Barbarossa during 1941 was limited in part <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> had no real army before 1939, and time to train and equip troops had been short.

25|$|At {{the time}} of the earthquake, Mexico was in its fifth year of a foreign debt crisis, and a {{contracting}} economy causing serious political problems for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Much of the PRI's authoritarian nature was tolerated <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> had seen four decades of economic expansion of six percent or better. When this disappeared, the PRI's power base began to shrink. Its reputation was damaged further when the government seemed to be deliberately downplaying the number of earthquake victims.

25|$|In 2010, 18.5% of Guatemalans {{belonged to}} the white ethnic group, with 41.7% of the {{population}} being mestizo, and 39.8% of the population belonging to the 23 Indigenous groups. It is difficult to make an accurate census of whites in Guatemala, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> categorizes all non-indigenous people are mestizo or ladino and {{a large majority of}} white Guatemalans consider themselves as mestizos or ladinos. By the 19th century the majority of immigrants were Germans, many who were bestowed fincas and coffee plantations in Cobán, while others went to Quetzaltenango and Guatemala City. Many young Germans married mestiza and indigenous Q'eqchi' women, which caused a gradual whitening. There was also immigration of Belgians to Santo Tomas and this contributed to the mixture of black and mestiza women in that region.|$|E
25|$|As for {{the reasons}} of Castillo in staying neutral, there are several {{interpretation}}s. One interpretation focuses on the Argentine tradition of neutrality. Others see Castillo as a nationalist, not being influenced by the power structure in Buenos Aires (since he was from Catamarca), so, {{with the support of}} the army, he could simply defy the pressure to join the Allies. A similar perspective considers instead that Castillo simply had no power to go against the wishes of the army, and if he declared war he would be deposed in a military coup. A third interpretation considers that only the United States wanted Argentina to declare war, whereas the United Kingdom was benefited by Argentine neutrality <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> was able to supply the British with livestock. This interpretation, however, fails to acknowledge the constant requests to declare war from Anglophile factions. Most likely, it was a combination of the desires of the British diplomacy and the Argentine army, which prevailed over the pro-war factions.|$|E

After a campaign lasting 18 days, the Belgian military, along with its commander-in-chief Leopold III, surrendered on 28 May. Belgium, together with the French province of Nord-Pas-de-Calais, were grouped together under the German Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France (Militärverwaltung in Belgien und Nordfrankreich). <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> was under military occupation, it initially fell {{under the control of the}} [...] rather than Nazi Party or Schutzstaffel (SS) authorities.
