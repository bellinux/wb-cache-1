She shared: [...] "on {{a lot of my}} projects I give them as crew gifts <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> production, and have water stations available, but you can't force people to use them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Controversy arose at the St. John's Board of Trade debate when Liberal {{candidate}} Danny Dumaresque {{was asked}} about an appeal by the mayor of St. John's for a new financial arrangement between {{the city and the}} provincial government. Dumaresque stated that [...] "there are {{a hell of a lot}} more priorities outside the overpass that need to be addressed <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> forking more money over to the City of St. John's." [...] The comment led to divisions within the party, with Liberal candidate Drew Brown stating it was an “idiotic comment by an idiotic man.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she said, {{with a new}} aspect {{drifting}} {{before her}} mind, [...] "then--we could eat. We could feed up <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started.</b> <b>We</b> could feast almost!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our {{clothing}} and provisions are," [...] said Randy. [...] "I saw them put down just <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started.</b> But the tools {{may be out}} there." ...|$|R

2500|$|Both Stéphane Dion and Jack Layton {{have promised}} to reverse the cut, with Dion also {{promising}} to increase funding to Canada Council for the Arts to $360 million, while Layton also promised to bring income averaging for artists to the national level and providing an annual tax exemption of $20,000 for income earned by copyright and residuals, stating that [...] "one of the key things we must do, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> giving $50-billion tax giveaways to banks and oil companies, is to protect and promote the arts" [...] and [...] "stable, sure and appropriate funding" [...] for CBC/Radio-Canada while also protecting Telefilm Canada and the Canadian Television Fund.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} only {{eight months after}} Music of the Sun had been released. Rihanna stated regarding the rapid album succession: [...] "We just {{felt like it was}} time. It made no sense waiting...you should never put time on music. You should never say, [...] "Okay, Music of the Sun has to be out at least {{a year and a half}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> with--" [...] No. That's what's great about the music business. When you feel it's time, you just go for it. And we felt like it was time to come up with a new album." [...] "SOS" [...] was included on the soundtrack of the film , where Rihanna made a cameo in the film as herself; her debut single, [...] "Pon de Replay", was also included in the soundtrack.|$|E
2500|$|... "Everything's storyboarded <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> shooting," [...] Deakins said in Entertainment Weekly. [...] "In No Country, there's {{maybe only}} a dozen shots {{that are not in}} the final film. It's that order of planning. And we only shot 250,000 feet, whereas most {{productions}} of that size might shoot 700,000 or a million feet of film. It's quite precise, the way they approach everything.... We never use a zoom," [...] he said. [...] "I don't even carry a zoom lens with me, unless it's for something very specific." [...] The famous coin-tossing scene between Chigurh and the old gas station clerk is a good example; the camera tracks in so slowly that the audience isn't even aware of the move. [...] "When the camera itself moves forward, the audience is moving, too. You're actually getting closer to somebody or something. It has, to me, a much more powerful effect, because it's a three-dimensional move. A zoom is more like a focusing of attention. You're just standing in the same place and concentrating on one smaller element in the frame. Emotionally, that's a very different effect." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the bye, Hilliard, I don't {{think you}} know my {{right-hand}} neighbour; he only joined us an hour <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started,</b> having been left behind at Cairo, sick.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't know we {{had gone}} so far--or rather that we had waited so long <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> down the hills," [...] Lanfear apologized in an {{involuntary}} whisper.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's jest what I proposed, old man, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> out; but {{you seemed}} to think it ought ter be done to-night, an' I was willin' to give in." ...|$|R

60|$|You needn't say {{anything}} about striking camp. I don't propose that any one should know till {{a quarter of an}} hour <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>start.</b>|$|E
60|$|And so {{the time}} went on. Yet never once did {{we think of}} giving up the quest and returning, since, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started,</b> <b>we</b> had sworn an oath that we would achieve or die. Indeed {{we ought to have}} died a score of times, yet always were preserved, most mysteriously preserved.|$|R
60|$|Therefore, within half an {{hour after}} having been made prisoner, Master Sitz was being hurried forward to Oghkwaga, under charge of two savages, and was well on his journey <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] Harry said; [...] "we {{are really}} not hungry. We had a good meal <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started.</b> So do you three sit down and I will tell you all we have seen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better try over number seventy-eight <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>start,</b> I suppose?" [...] said William, {{pointing}} to a heap of old Christmas-carol books on a side table.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> back, we {{will climb}} round {{to the top}} of the hill, and see what has {{happened}} to shut up the staircase." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quarter after four," [...] said Roger, {{consulting}} his watch. [...] "Bert, we {{can take}} you around the lake with ease <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> for home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor fellow!" [...] said Henri, [...] "if {{adversity}} {{will teach}} him, {{he is likely}} to get his lesson now. Did he part quietly with you, Agatha, on the day <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> to Saumur?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{must have}} been <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> to look for you," [...] {{returned}} Dave. [...] "After this {{you want to be}} careful how you climb around. Some of the rocks are loose and very treacherous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} yet told me, by-the-bye, what old Mr Rogan said to you just <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started.</b> Did he give you any hint as to where you might be sent to after {{reaching}} Norway House?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we {{had better}} get to sea, but we must {{find out about the}} tug <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>start.</b> On the whole, I think we'll get about it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit up {{all night}} re-gulletting them with a file. I want four loads of billets <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> again; but we'll take another axe ashore in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess that's sufficient. Come {{right back}} with us to 'Frisco and we'll have a few off days <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> you. This is no country for a live man, anyway." ...|$|E
60|$|In the end, just as I {{was about}} to trek seawards, an old friend, Maputa, turned up at my wagons--that same man who had brought me the message from Panda <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> to attack Bangu.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am a fool," [...] Malcolm said, [...] "not to {{have seen}} to it <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started.</b> I can't do much now; but at least I can fasten it so as to hurt you as little as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thank you. I had an {{excellent}} supper <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started.</b> I looked {{at some of the}} cabins but I decided to spend the night on deck. What about you? You seem to have arrived in a hurry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{no doubt}} you'll prove an apt pupil," [...] he remarked. [...] "Have you finished? If so, we'll {{go and have}} a {{cigarette}} in my room <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> work with Grumps." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{belongs to}} me," [...] Trent {{answered}} shortly. [...] "We fixed it so <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started.</b> <b>We</b> {{neither of us}} took much stock in our relations. If I had died, Monty would have taken the lot. It was a fair deal. You'll find it there!" ...|$|R
