50|$|As {{video games}} flourished and became {{increasingly}} common, however, amateur game designers began to adapt video {{games for the}} <b>blind</b> <b>via</b> sound. In time audio game programmers began to develop audio-only games, based to a smaller and smaller degree on existing video game ideas and instead focusing on the possibilities of game immersion and feedback with sound. Specifically, three-dimensional positional audio (binaural recording) has been developed since 2000 and now figures prominently in, for example, such audio games as BBBeat. To effect this, a sound is played in the left, center, or right channel to indicate an object's position in a virtual gaming environment. Generally, this involves stereo panning of various sound effects, {{many of which are}} looped to serve as indicators of hazards or objects with which the user can interact. Volume also {{plays a major role in}} 3D audio games primarily to indicate an object's proximity with reference to the user. The pitch of a sound is often varied to convey other information about the object it symbolizes. Voice talent is used to indicate menu items rather than text. These parameters have allowed for the creation of, among other genres, side scrollers, 3D action adventures, shooters, and arcade style games.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Design and {{manufacturing}} techniques of {{printed circuit boards}} (PCB's) have advanced from early one or two-layer structures to the multilayer boards where ten or more layers are no longer uncommon. These give additional routing space, potential decrease in device size and various design possibilities like solid ground and power planes. Unfortunately multilayer boards are vulnerable to high coupling between signal vias especially due to PCB resonances. In this study via crosscoupling is investigated on multilayer PCB's. Special attention {{is given to the}} coupling due to resonances and vertically aligned <b>blind</b> <b>vias.</b> Problem is approached from the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) point of view and high accuracy of measurements or models is not the objective. Instead ways to increase isolation are considered important. EMC is considered to include internal functionality of the device. Analytical methods are used to calculate resonant frequencies, fields and quality factors for simple rectangular structures. The PCB cavity is reduced to two-dimensions for numerical calculation of same quantities. Aplac finite-difference time-domain simulator is used to model coupling due to PCB resonances. Isolation between vertically aligned <b>blind</b> <b>vias</b> is estimated analytically. A quasi-static numerical model is used to study a coaxial via structure. Multilayer test boards are constructed for measurement purposes. Simplified resonator structures on two-layer boards are used to test different methods to increase isolation. Measurements show that high coupling between vias may occur due to PCB resonances. This leads to the situation, where previously used isolation methods between vias are not necessarily effective enough. Several means to reduce effects of PCB resonances are described in this study. Measured and modelled results agree well from an EMC point of view. Coupling due to vertically aligned <b>blind</b> <b>vias</b> is also shown to be high. A simple capacitance model may be used to approximate this up to frequencies where the dynamic wave nature of the board starts to be important. From a PCB designer's point of view these results mean that when the board size is not small compared to the wavelength, there is a possibility of resonances and reduction methods have to be taken into account. Also placement of the vias have to be carefully selected especially if <b>blind</b> or buried <b>vias</b> are used...|$|R

40|$|Trend towards {{downsizing}} {{the product}} size {{and at the}} same time to bring more functionality in electronic products, demands electrically interconnecting several miniaturized electronic components with high counts of I (Input/Out put) on smaller and smaller size printed wiring boards [PWB]. These miniature components occupy lower foot print area but require higher routing interconnection densities. However, the conventional multilayer board technologies exhibit limitations when there is need to connect very high IØ components such as ball grid arrays, which require blind and buried interconnections within the multilayer mono-block. This limitation has given raise to newer methods of multi layer construction. Build–up multilayer PWB is now the technology of choice for enhanced routing capability including blind and buried interlayer connections. Build up methods are based on making very small vias within dielectric layers followed by metalisation. Typically <b>blind</b> and buried <b>vias</b> are very small, and hence called “micro vias” connecting the layers selectively within the multilayer mono-block. Buried vias make the interconnection between the consecutive layers, and <b>blind</b> <b>vias</b> connect the surface layers to any one of the interior layers in the build up multilayer board. If the <b>blind</b> <b>vias</b> are filled with a dielectric, the entire top and bottom surface area becomes available for high -density component mounting. The crux in build up board technologies is the method of creating micro-holes; a micro hole is a hole, which is less than 150 micro meter in diameter. Efforts are made to replace existing metalising techniques with “paste filling” methodologies, which would result in “SOLID CONDUCTING VIAS” CALLED AS “MICRO -INTERCONNECTS” The work reported in this thesis aims at demonstrating one such innovative ‘solid conducting via’ formation without using any of the known micro-hole formation techniques. Based on the results obtained some useful conclusions have been drawn which will perhaps go a long way in the name of “PRINTED PILLAR TECHNOLOGY” a novel methodology for building multilayer suitable for very high IØ components such as “ball grid arrays. ...|$|R

40|$|A novel wafer level {{packaging}} process for phosphor converted LED {{is presented in}} this paper. The core {{of this process is}} the fabrication of a silicon substrate with cavities for phosphor printing and through-silicon copper pillars for 3 D interconnection. A double-side polished 4 -inch wafer is used as the substrate. In the present process, DRIE is applied to {{the back side of the}} silicon wafer firstly for forming <b>blind</b> <b>vias.</b> The next step is to perform DRIE from the front side to create cavities for LED chip mounting and phosphor printing. Copper is then electroplated to fill the <b>blind</b> <b>vias</b> to form copper pillars. After the copper plating, KOH etching is applied to the front side to further etch the cavities in order to expose the embedded copper pillars. Afterwards, solder is plated on the exposed tips of copper pillars at the bottom of the cavities. Finally, the copper overburden on the back side of the wafer is patterned as the redistribution layer for the next level of interconnection. Subsequent to the fabrication of silicon substrate, blue LEDs are flip-chip mounted on the pre-plated solder bumps in the cavities. Reflow soldering is then conducted to fix the LED chips. Following an epoxy dispensing process, yellow phosphor powder is printed into the cavity for color tuning. The pre-dispensed epoxy is then UV-cured to serve as the phosphor powder binder and the LED chip encapsulant. The present configuration offers a structure with low profile and compact footprint for LED wafer level packaging. The fabrication process is described in detail in this paper. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{objects and}} images {{pertaining to the}} tactile experience of blind and visually-impaired people in nineteenth-century European culture, questioning {{the ways in which}} shifting sensory hierarchies (particularly the relationship between touch and vision) constituted blindness as disability. We focus on a theme that held particular social and cultural interest in nineteenth-century accounts of blindness: travel and geography. We contrast the writings and portraiture of James Holman, a British traveller with visual disabilities, with the pedagogic programmes that were developed in European institutions for blind people. Holman’s public persona optimistically pointed to ways of knowing the world that were not dependent upon vision. Yet when geographic touch entered the institution, it became subject to disciplinary control, replicating the conventions of sight and curtailing movement of the body through promotion of local, above global, knowledge. This comparative approach enables a critical examination of the tactile realm of blindness. We analyse medical-pedagogical ideas on impaired perception and sensory compensation that underpinned attempts to define the touch of the <b>blind</b> <b>via</b> instructive object-lessons, alongside heuristic ways of engaging with the world through touch.

40|$|Surface Technology and in particular, Electroplating, is a key, {{across-the-board}} discipline {{without which}} {{the entire range of}} today's manufactured products would not exist. The formation of functional surfaces is a key to innovation in all branches of industry. In the realm of Electroplating, the use of pulsed deposition currents, known as "Pulse Plating" allows the production of a wider range of coating layers than those possible using DC, with extremely attractive functional properties. It is, however, the case that Pulse Plating is a knowledge-based technology. In order to exploit it to the full, a detailed knowledge of electrode kinetics and mass-transport in the electrolyte is essential. This volume, edited by two leading authorities in the field, presents the state-of-art knowledge of the science and the associated technology and equipment. Building on what was hitherto the standard work on the subject, written in the 1990 's, the current understanding of the basic principles is presented together with the full range of processes now available, within its 400 pages, in the English language. Significant developments within the field of Pulse Plating both from aqueous solutions and ionic liquids include the deposition of binary and ternary alloys, composite coatings, compositionally-graded coatings and multilayer coatings. Also described are nanocrystalline deposits and selective plating which is widely used in electronics manufacture and in high-rate deposition processes for coating semiconductors (electronics, solar cells [...] ). The technology is also used in anodic processes (oxidation, electrochemical machining, electropolishing etc). Following a forward-looking but also critical introductory chapter, the book falls into four sections covering all the basic principles and significant industrial applications of the technology. The first of these sections opens with an in-depth treatment of the thermodynamics and reaction kinetics of metal deposition at the metal-electrolyte interface. Special emphasis is laid on the kinetics of multi-step processes, on alloy deposition as well as the importance and modus operandi of additives, all of this supported with examples and documentation. Nucleation and growth processes in electrodeposition and formation of microstructure as well as nanocrystalline deposits using both DC and Pulse Plating are described. A systematic approach to the effect of additives, hitherto scarcely described in the literature, is also provided. The effect of Pulse Plating parameters on secondary current distribution (below the limiting current density) is critical. The use of simulation and modelling is also discussed, not least as used in an industrial setting. One important example of this is the modelling of copper electrodeposition for <b>blind</b> <b>via</b> filling. Of special importance in metal electrodeposition using Pulse Plating are phenomena at the electrode double layer in relation to mass transport and the effects of current pulsing on the double layer structure, which in turn, affects current efficiency. The effects of pulsed current on additives and microstructure as well as alloy deposition are also discussed. Finally, the various models used in simulation of metal and alloy electrodeposition are described. In the second section, various aspects and requirements for industrial applications of pulse electrodeposition are set out. Thanks to electronic and electrotechnical developments in modern power supplies, these can deliver any conceivable pulse regime in terms of current and rapid voltage transients such as square wave pulses. Where suitable equipment is installed, this ensures that the deposition process can be optimised. The means by which an understanding of basic principles can be harnessed to the practical electrodeposition of metals is shown with special emphasis on identification of key pulse plating parameters. Especially helpful in this respect is a systematic approach to determining these parameters for rack and barrel plating. Finally, there is a consideration of the environmental aspects of pulse plating in terms of energy consumption and the related CO 2 emissions. The third section of the book covers in great depth, the industrial applications of pulse plating. Of these, the most important is currently copper electrodeposition for printed circuit board manufacture with special emphasis on Pulse Reverse Plating for through-hole contacting and filling of blind vias. It is in these particular applications that the strengths of Pulse Plating become especially evident. Also covered is the deposition of nickel and its alloys as well as the deposition of nickel-phosphorus deposits, electroforming and formation of nanocrystalline nickel layers. Other processes include electrodeposition of tin and its alloys and the broad topic of chromium plating for decorative or functional applications. The deposition of precious metals and their alloys is discussed and the section concludes with an in-depth treatment of zinc and zinc alloy deposition, especially zinc-nickel. The fourth and last section deals with special systems. This includes the use of pulsed current for anodising aluminium and its alloys, Electrochemical Machining (ECM) as well as electropolishing. Other applications include the deposition of nanostructured multilayers (CMM) and the potential applications of pulse plating for electrodeposition of composite coatings, especially those incorporating nano-sized second phase particles. The whole volume is systematically laid out with various aspects clearly classified. It leaves no doubt as to the huge potential of the method for future developments in electrochemical surface treatment and the associated equipment.
