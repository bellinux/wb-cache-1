40|$|Part 3 : Knowledge Based Production ManagementInternational audienceProcess {{planning}} {{plays an}} important role as a <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> <b>product</b> design and manufacturing. Computer-aided process planning (CAPP) has been actively discussed in this half century, and numerous works have been conducted. To meet recent strong requirements for realizing agile manufacturing, a set of flexible process planning methods have been developed. Those methods dealt with process planning only for one product and generate the optimal plan which achieves the shortest total machining time. However, in real manufacturing, multiple workpieces are machined with multiple machine tools in the same period, and pursuing the shortest machining time for each workpiece may result in poor productivity. This research aims to enhance those methods {{from the point of view}} of total productivity. Selection of the optimal process plan in the conventional methods and production scheduling were merged and then formulated as a 0 - 1 integer programming problem. This method was applied to a simple example and its potential was shown...|$|R

The purpose {{of this research is}} to build the <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> a <b>product’s</b> simplified she and its perception by consumers. The chosen product in this research is a car. A survey has been created to collect consumers’ impression, especially from Brazil, Canada, France and Italy: nine different car silhouettes have been presented separately against a list of adjectives that represent a possible perception evoked by the car silhouette. The participant had to evaluate the car silhouette against a semantic differential scale and answer two extra questions related to ownership. The results have been analyzed and a linear regression analysis has been performed in order to create two new profiles based on survey’s results; the two profiles have been validated by consumers thanks to another survey...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cosmeceuticals, {{which is}} the fastest growing segment of the natural {{personal}} care industry. These cosmeceuticals, serving as a <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> personal care <b>products</b> and pharmaceuticals, have been developed specifically for their medicinal and cosmetic benefits. Cosmeceuticals (or alternatively, cosmaceuticals) are topical cosmetic pharmaceutical hybrids intended to enhance the beauty through ingredients that provide additional health-related function or benefit. The cosmeceutical concept is used by many skin-care companies; especially those endorsed by dermatologists, {{to give the impression}} that the products contain more effective or more biologically active ingredients than just ordinary cosmetics. Hence, anyone can slap the label with tall claims to promote these products saying the products are more beneficial than the existing conventional regulated cosmetic products...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop generic assembly relations to support variant management to aid the product development for products as families. The advent of the buyers' market has encouraged manufacturers to offer products as families to meet customers needs for differentiation. This creates the corresponding need for representing the product and process variants {{in a way to}} support the assessment of impact of product variants. Through the study of literature and standards, the current status of product modelling and product family was captured. Existing models of product model have considered representation of products as one of a kind and do not have the necessary capability to incorporate the variation in production variants that is commonly seen in the assembly of families of product. A Generic Assembly Relations Model (GARM) has been developed to meet the requirements. The generic Bill-of-Material (GBQM) and generic Bill-of-Process (GBQP) have been introduced as a single formalism to represent the product and process variants. The proposed model supports the reuse of product/process variants through the Generic Assembly Relations and GBQM and GBQP. The integration is achieved by the generic relations which act as the <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> <b>product</b> and process models. This research increases the understanding of how to model product and process in the product family environment. The GARM model works as a production support tool for the product family in the Concurrent Engineering environment. With the GARM model, different views of the requirements can be developed at an early stage; the designer can be supported with feedback information such as the change of product component and assembly process. The GARM model supports variant management to aid the product development for products as families. The impact of the product variant on assembly process can be evaluated through the model. It has been validated by illustrating how the data structure definition supports the evaluation of changes in product family assembly process definition when additional variants are added through an example from the Personal Computer industry...|$|R

40|$|Part 4 : Self-organizing Manufacturing SystemsInternational audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a proposed methodology to extend the evolvable assembly system (EAS) paradigm for product design by utilizing assembly features in a product. In this paper, assembly features are used to <b>bridge</b> the gap <b>between</b> <b>product</b> design and assembly process by matching features of a part in an assembly to operations of a process in the EAS ontology. This can be achieved by defining and extracting a new set of assembly features called process features, which are features significant to specific and well- defined assembly operations. The extracted assembly features are represented in a proposed model based on product topology. A case-study example is conducted to illustrate the new methodology. A process-feature ontology is proposed as well in order to match the assembly requirements represented by process features with the available processes and skills in the EAS ontology so that adaptation of the production system can be achieved...|$|R

The sector {{is in need of}} a cultural change to bring more innovation in to new products and service developments. Diagnostic and therapeutic technologies need to be made available to the wider community. Allowing patients and clinicians to participate in the product development process has become essential; the current Intellectual Property model however does not accommodate this.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a formal methodology for defining and assessing product performance and its implementation in a prototype computer system. The methodology {{is based on}} abstract descriptions of the operations that are conducted within the design process. It is, consequently, extremely generic and creates a <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> physical <b>product</b> performance and actual user requirements. The methodology is based on defining product attributes in terms of observable parameters of the product in use. Defining an attribute in this way inherently reflects its required interaction with the user and consequently can truly {{be said to be}} in "user terms" A product will have a range of attributes and a performance indicator is proposed, such that the attributes are combined in a way that reflects their relative importance to the user. At the conceptual stage of the design process, when the actual product does not exist, and only some abstract representation is available, it is vitally important to be able to model or simulate and hence evaluate the product attributes. This area of design has often been associated with non algorithmic design procedures, because of its intangible nature. In this thesis the attribute methodology has been used to implement a prototype Computer Aided Design Evaluation Tool (CADET), which has been used and tested with an existing product range. The methodology being abstractly defined supports a wide range of product attributes. It also gives an indication of how the correspondingly wide range of existing analysis software could be integrated into a powerful single Computer Aided Design system. This work has resulted in the publication of two papers in refereed Journals and the presentation of eight other papers at refereed International Conferences. A list of the publications is included in the Appendices...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} respond to {{increasing}} competitive pressure from low-wage countries on manufacturing companies in Western Europe, competitive assembly systems {{need to be developed}} by combining flexibility, autonomy, and productivity. In high-wage countries, this goal can only be achieved by a high level of automation. Furthermore, automation allows for implementing highly reliable processes and has the potential to increase product quality and improve working conditions at the same time. High-performing modular machine architectures have found their way in every day industrial production. The remaining challenge lies in the efficient planning of complex assembly tasks. In this context, the objective of the funded research project DeLas was the significant reduction of process development and production ramp-up times for the automated assembly of laser systems and optical modules by <b>bridging</b> the gap <b>between</b> <b>product</b> development and automation control. The approach of the project was to develop and integrate methods and software tools for implementing complex sensor-guided handling and alignment processes into a software toolchain which covers the relevant steps of automated laser assembly. Based on virtual production environments, virtual and real commissioning of processes grew closer together and strengthened the role and impact of offline programming. The DeLas team focused on the missing links between the commercially available and well-established engineering tools. Therefore, interfaces between the different software systems have been realized. Parallel to the conceptual design and realization of the engineering toolchain, industrial use cases from the assembly of optical systems have been studied for a better understanding of industrial needs. The studies included the complete engineering chain <b>between</b> <b>product</b> specification and process commissioning on an industrial assembly platform. A demonstrator showing a stable assembly process for micro-optical systems has been presented during several events and trade fairs. The project has successfully shown the potential of better integration of engineering tools and engineering models in the industrial branches of lasers and optics. Main impact can be expected from shortening the time <b>between</b> <b>product</b> design and process commissioning potentially influencing the time-to-market (TTM) and machine utilization in an environment of versatile production requiring frequent commissioning...|$|R
