40|$|Using {{the recent}} idea of {{balancing}} two-center and three-center bondings between boron atoms, {{a new class}} of stable chiral boron nanostructures (fullerenes and nanotubes) is designed. The structures of these fullerenes consist of triangular and hexagonal motifs similar to those seen in the most stable α-boron sheet and the B_ 80 fullerene. The binding energy of the new sheet is only 0. 02 eV lower than that of the α-boron sheet. Our density functional calculations show that these new boron nanostructures are energetically competitive with the recently proposed α-boron nanostructures. For example, B_ 60, the smallest member of this new 60 n^ 2 boron fullerene family, is 0. 7 eV more stable than exact <b>boron</b> <b>equivalent</b> of icosahedral C_ 60 fullerene.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{sorption}} {{of boron}} by clay minerals from natural waters {{has been studied}} experimentally. The quantity of boron sorbed per unit weight of clay mineral is dependent on both the salinity and the boron content of the solution. Previous work has shown that illite is the best clay mineral sorbent, though kaolinite and montmorillonite dosorb some boron and this is confirmed by the present work. The new experimental results demonstrate {{that the amount of}} boron sorbed by illite is not affected by the original boron content of the mineral and suggest hat the process of incorporation ofboron into the lattice proceeds in two stages. The bearing of these experimental results on the use of boron as a palaeosalinity indicator in sedimentary ocks is discussed and this leads {{to the conclusion that the}} rate of sedi-mentation may also influence the boron content of such rocks. Boron in the earth's crust is concentrated in the sedimentary rocks (Urey, 1953), but it can be shown that present-day oceans are capable of dissolving an amount of <b>boron</b> <b>equivalent</b> to that present in the sedimentary ocks of the crust. Thus, boron, originally present in the oceans, must have been removed by some other process than precipita...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{materials}} play {{a fundamental}} {{role in the}} development of fusion reactors, for both the generation of electric power and the production of nuclear materials. It is possible to synthesise graphite and carbon materials from coal. Coal is available in large quantities and could be used for the production of high-purity carbon graphite. However, it contains large quantities of impurities that need to be removed prior to graphitisation/carbonisation. The impurity levels of certain elements in this graphite must be kept at very low levels. Boron, which absorbs neutrons strongly, should be below 500 ppb. Europium and gadolinium, which absorb neutrons and are activated to highly radioactive products, as is cobalt, should be as low as 50 ppb. Lithium transforms to tritium, which leads to the circulating helium becoming radioactive. Other elements, such as calcium, sodium, silicon, thorium and uranium, should not be ignored. The purpose of this study was to lower or remove completely the impurities and trace elements in coal that affect the quality of nuclear-grade graphite. The organic part of Tshikondeni coal was dissolved in a solvent, dimethylformamide (DMF), on addition of sodium hydroxide. The first stage of purification is centrifugation and filtration, which removes most of the impurities. The recovered organic material, known as ‘Refcoal’, may be converted to graphitisable coke. Some elements, significantly boron and cobalt, associate with the organic material in solution and are not sufficiently separated by centrifugation and filtration. Further purification was employed during each process step in the conversion of coal solution into graphite. Different methods of purification were employed in this study. They included chlorination, acid treatment and the ion-exchange or complexation method. Chlorine gas and hexachlorocyclohexane (benzene hexachloride) were used in the chlorination method. Acids such as hydrochloric, hydrofluoric and ascorbic were used in acid treatment. In the ion-exchange method, reagents such as methane, starch, potassium cyanide, ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid, sodium fluoride, sodium sulphate, ice, glycerol and sodium nitrate were used. All the treated Refcoal was coked at 1 000 º C. Pyrolysis was applied in other methods with the aim of volatilising elements that form volatile halides at higher temperatures. Analysis was done for elements such as calcium, cobalt, europium, gadolinium, lithium, sodium, silicon, thorium and uranium, and other elements in the periodic table. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy were used to analyse the concentrations of the trace elements in the coal (treated and untreated) and the coked Refcoal. In inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, microwave digestion and fusion were applied as methods of preparation. However, the instrumentation gave different results for the same sample. The results showed that specific methods work for specific elements. The chlorination method and the acid-treatment method (especially using hydrofluoric acid and hydrochloric acid) gave better purification for most of the trace elements and other elements. Better purification was achieved with elements such as, boron, calcium, europium, gadolinium, lithium, sodium and silicon. All the treatments failed to lower uranium and thorium to the level required for nuclear-grade graphite. However, uranium has a low <b>boron</b> <b>equivalent</b> and does not pose serious problems with respect to nuclear usage. All the methods failed to remove cobalt and this remains a problem.

25|$|Boric acid in {{equilibrium}} {{with its}} conjugate base the borate ion {{is widely used}} (in the concentration range 50 - 100ppm <b>boron</b> <b>equivalents)</b> as a primary or adjunct pH buffer system in swimming pools. Boric acid is a weak acid, with pKa (the pH at which buffering is strongest because the free acid and borate ion are in equal concentrations) of 9.24 in pure water at 25°C. But apparent pKa is substantially lower in swimming pool or ocean waters because of interactions with various other molecules in solution. It will be around 9.0 in a salt-water pool. No matter which form of soluble boron is added, within the acceptable range of pH and boron concentration for swimming pools, boric acid is the predominant form in aqueous solution, {{as shown in the}} accompanying figure. The boric acid - borate system can be useful as a primary buffer system (substituting for the bicarbonate system with pKa1 = 6.0 and pKa2 = 9.4 under typical salt-water pool conditions) in pools with salt-water chlorine generators that tend to show upward drift in pH from a working range of pH 7.5 - 8.2. Buffer capacity is greater against rising pH (towards the pKa around 9.0), as illustrated in the accompanying graph. The use of boric acid in this concentration range does not allow any reduction in free HOCl concentration needed for pool sanitation, but it may add marginally to the photo-protective effects of cyanuric acid and confer other benefits through anti-corrosive activity or perceived water softness, depending on overall pool solute composition.|$|R

The 15 B 41 steel alloy contains elements that influence the martensitic transformation. Such influence allows the formation of a needle shaped martensite whose thin slats and global shape close together. Such quenching microstructure leads to the precipitation of very fine carbides at low tempering conditions, which are very close together. On the other hand, at high tempering conditions the precipitated carbides are significantly larger and are not coherent with the iron matrix. These microstructures highlight the tensile strength of tempered steel, but also cause a noticeable loss of notch toughness when tempering around 350 ¡C, which weakens the steel's impact resistance...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alternative {{sources of}} {{irrigation}} water can contain excess boron. Twenty-six grapevine genotypes were assessed for their tolerance to excess boron under non-saline and saline conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Rootling vines received {{one of three}} irrigation treatments: Control (B 0. 2 [*]mM), Boron (B 0. 67 [*]mM) or Boron+Salt [B 0. 6 [*]mM, electrical conductivity 4. 0 [*]dS/m]. In the Boron treatment, shoot growth ranged from 88 to 14 % {{of that in the}} Control, and in the Boron+Salt from 58 to 10 % of that in the Control. Within genotype comparison showed that the growth of shoots in the Boron and Boron+Salt treatments was equivalent in 24 genotypes. Genotype did not affect the leaf B concentration in the Boron treatment. The addition of salinity did not affect the leaf B concentration in 25 genotypes. In 14 genotypes, the leaf Na+ concentration in the Boron treatment was more than double that in the Control. In the Boron and Boron+Salt treatments, shoot growth was not correlated with B concentration in the leaf, and in the Boron+Salt treatment, it was not correlated with Cl− and Na+ concentration in the leaf. Boron and Boron+Salt treatments reduced the leaf photosynthetic rate and the effective quantum yield of photosystem II (ΦPSII). CONCLUSIONS: There was a large genotypic variation in the tolerance of growth to excess boron. It could not be attributed to the variation in leaf B concentration. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: The shoot growth in 1613 Couderc and Vitis acerifolia under excess <b>boron</b> was <b>equivalent</b> to that in the Control treatment, which indicates that the use of these two genotypes as rootstocks may produce vines with an improved tolerance to excess boron.

40|$|Alkaline soils {{used for}} dryland {{cropping}} across the semi-arid regions of south=eastern Australia typically have {{high levels of}} salinity (ECe), sodicity (ESP) and soluble boron (B) in the subsoil. The current research was undertaken to improve our knowledge of the physicochemical characteristics of these alkaline soils and assess what impact they have on the growth and water use of cereals. A survey of representative alkaline soils of the southern Mallee and Wimmera regions of Victoria, comprising 140 Calcarosol profiles and 10 Vertosol profiles, revealed high correlation between exchangeable Na+ and both ESP (r = 0. 96) and B (r = 0. 88). ESP and ECe (r = 0. 71) and B and pH 1 : 5 (r = 0. 70) were also highly correlated. Readily measured properties (field texture, pH 1 : 5, ECe and exchangeable Na+) were found to provide good estimates of ESP and boron in these soils. Overall, ESP was best defined as 1. 47 + 2. 68 x Na+ (r 2 = 93. 9) and boron by 0. 34 + 3. 93 x Na+ (r 2 = 76. 7). A break point values for pH was defined such that soils with pH 1 : 5 < 8. 1 have low levels of soil boron that are not potentially toxic to cereal growth. The growth and water use of the boron tolerant wheat cultivar, Frame, was monitored on these soils during the 1999 -growing season. A descriptive model that explained 54 % of the variation in grain yield (range: 1. 3 - 6. 1 Mg/ha) was established using ridge regression analysis, which is not confounded by the correlation that exists between the physicochemical factors (collinearity). The statistical analysis identified rainfall around anthesis, available soil water in the 0. 10 - 0. 40 m layer at sowing, nitrate in the 0 - 0. 10 m layer and salinity and sodicity in the 0. 60 - 1. 00 m layer as significant explanatory variables for grain yield and water use. Subsoil salinity (ECe) and sodicity (ESP) were effective surrogates for extractability of water in the deep subsoil. It is estimated that crops can make use of water at depth if subsoils have ECe < 8 dS/m and ESP < 19 %. Levels of soluble soil boron (reaching concentrations of up to 52 mg/kg), were not significantly correlated with root growth, water uptake or yield of wheat. It is proposed that the boron tolerance of cv. Frame rendered high boron as non-limiting and that the high Na+ in these soils had an overriding effect in driving variation in crop yield. The impact of boron tolerance, watering regime and soil disturbance on the growth and water use of near-isogenic lines of wheat and barley was assessed using large intact soil cores (0. 3 m diam. x 1. 0 m height), containing an alkaline soil (Calcarosol) sampled from the southern Mallee. Within the subsoil (0. 80 - 0. 90 m) ECes, ESP and B was 8. 1 dS/m, 29 % and 31 mg/kg respectively. In the shallower (0. 61 - 0. 71 m) layer respective levels were 7. 2 dS/m, 22 % and 29 mg/kg. Crop root growth between these layers decreased significantly with depth and no net water extraction occurred beyond 0. 80 m, irrespective of crop boron tolerance. As the concentration of soil <b>boron</b> was <b>equivalent</b> across these layers, it was discounted from being a constraint to water extraction by crop. Rather, the increase in EC 0 and more so ESP suggests these factors were constraining water use at depth. Grain yield per unit of applied water for wheat and barley grown under low water supply was 1. 5 times that of their high water counterparts, suggesting inefficiencies in water capture by crops under the high water regime. Deep ripping had no effect on grain yield. Importantly these results showed boron tolerance provided little benefit to cereals on soil where constraints in addition to high boron exist. A glasshouse trial was conducted to assess how interactive effects of boron and salinity and cultivar affected the early growth of wheat using a range of soil salinity and soluble boron levels observed in the field survey. The three cultivars, Frame, BT Schomburgk and Schomburgk, varied significantly in tolerance to boron, with critical soil concentrations were estimated at 53, 32 and 27 mg/kg respectively in the absence of salinity. These 3 varieties did not differ in tolerance to salt in the absence of high boron, where cultivars equally tolerated ECe = 9 dS/m. Boron and Na+ in shoot tissue could not be used to define critical concentration for toxicity. This trial demonstrates the value Of using genetic variation for adaptation of wheat to high levels of boron, but appears not the case for salt tolerance here. This thesis confirmed that, due to the strong intercorrelation that exists between the physicochemical factors, salinity, sodicity and soluble boron, that these factors are likely to operate simultaneously to reduce cereal growth. Adequate boron tolerance currently appears to exist in commercial wheat cultivars i. e. Frame, enabling these varieties to withstand the high boron levels encountered in the alkaline cropping soils of north-western Victoria. High. levels of salinity and sodicity, however, {{are more likely to be}} constraining growth through osmotic, toxic and physical impediment. This thesis indicates the need for improve tolerance of cereals to salinity and the need for pyramiding tolerances for crops targeted to alkaline soils where constraints exist together.
