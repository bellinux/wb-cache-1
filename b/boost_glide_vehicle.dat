50|$|Through the 1960s, the skip-glide concept saw {{interest}} {{not as a}} way {{to extend}} range, which was no longer a concern with modern missiles, but as the basis for maneuverable reentry vehicles for ICBMs. The first known example was the Alpha Draco tests of 1959, followed by the <b>Boost</b> <b>Glide</b> Reentry <b>Vehicle</b> (BGRV) test series, ASSET and PRIME.|$|R
25|$|The program {{demonstrated}} that the vehicle was able to generate lift/drag ratio of 3.5 to 1, allowing it to greatly extend its range. Although this was not put to immediate use, the tests provided valuable data that was used for later programs like the <b>Boost</b> <b>Glide</b> Reentry <b>Vehicle</b> and the ASSET and PRIME programs. Better understanding of the hypersonic lift process also led to the lifting body designs of the 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|Adding {{to their}} {{concerns}} was a Soviet anti-ballistic missile system which {{was known to}} be under development at Sary Shagan. WS-199 was expanded to develop a maneuvering reentry vehicle (MARV), which greatly complicated the problem of shooting down a warhead. Two designs were tested in 1957, Alpha Draco and the <b>Boost</b> <b>Glide</b> Reentry <b>Vehicle.</b> These used long and skinny arrow-like shapes that provided aerodynamic lift in the high atmosphere, and could be fitted to existing missiles like Minuteman. However, their shape required more room {{on the front of the}} missile than a traditional RV. To address this, the Minuteman silos were revised to be built [...] deeper. Although Minuteman would not deploy a boost-glide warhead, the extra space proved invaluable in the future as it allowed the missile to be extended and carry more fuel and payload.|$|R

50|$|The Pentagon, DARPA, the Air Force Research Laboratory, and the Naval Research Laboratory are researching {{technologies}} like directed-energy weapon and railguns to counter maturing threats posed by fast missiles such as ballistic missiles, hypersonic cruise missiles, and hypersonic <b>glide</b> <b>vehicles.</b> These systems of missile defense {{are expected to}} come online {{in the mid to}} late-2020s.|$|R
50|$|China is {{apparently}} {{working on a}} second generation ASBM using hypersonic <b>glide</b> <b>vehicle</b> technology tested on the WU-14. This would allow the warhead {{to search for the}} current location of the carrier, instead of just dropping down to the spot it was first aimed at. The high speed maneuvers would also make the missile much harder to intercept.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to these maneuvering warhead concepts, {{there has been}} growing interest in the traditional boost-glide concept not to extend range per se, but {{to allow it to}} reach a given range while flying at a much lower altitude. The goal, in this case, is to keep the reentry vehicle below radar coverage until it enters the terminal phase. Such a system is assumed to be used on the Chinese DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile, which is also believed to maneuver during the terminal phase to make interception more difficult. The later DF-26, a development of the DP-21, may be armed with the WU-14, a hypersonic <b>glide</b> <b>vehicle</b> that has been successfully tested six times by the Chinese.

40|$|Recent {{events in}} {{hypersonic}} <b>glide</b> <b>vehicle</b> programs have necessitated {{a new approach}} to examine possible flight test trajectories to include new constraints on optimal trajectory generation. Aircraft stability, combined thermo-structural loading, and vehicle ablation are all important considerations for hypersonic vehicle flight; optimal trajectory genera-tion should account for these complex constraints. A collaborative effort was undertaken by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Directorate and the 412 th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base to analyze possible optimal control solutions that satisfy these constraints. A three-stage booster aerodynamic and propulsion model and a hy-personic <b>glide</b> <b>vehicle</b> aerodynamic and ablation model were implemented in the General Pseudospectral Optimization Software (GPOPS).

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of the paper is to compute the optimal burn-out conditions and control requirements {{that would result in}} maximum down-range/cross-range performance of a waverider type hypersonic boost-glide (HBG) vehicle within the medium and intermediate ranges, and compare its performance with the performances of wing-body and lifting-body vehicles vis-à-vis the g-load and the integrated heat load experienced by vehicles for the medium-sized launch vehicle under study. Trajectory optimization studies were carried out by considering the heat rate and dynamic pressure constraints. The trajectory optimization problem is modeled as a nonlinear, multiphase, constraint optimal control problem and is solved using a hp-adaptive pseudospectral method. Detail modeling aspects of mass, aerodynamics and aerothermodynamics for the launch and <b>glide</b> <b>vehicles</b> have been discussed. It was found that the optimal burn-out angles for waverider and wing-body configurations are approximately 5 ° and 14. 8 °, respectively, for maximum down-range performance under the constraint heat rate environment. The down-range and cross-range performance of HBG waverider configuration is nearly 1. 3 and 2 times that of wing-body configuration respectively. The integrated heat load experienced by the HBG waverider was found to be approximately an order of magnitude higher than that of a lifting-body configuration and 5 times that of a wing-body configuration. The footprints and corresponding heat loads and control requirements for the three types of <b>glide</b> <b>vehicles</b> are discussed for the medium range launch vehicle under consideration...|$|R

The AHW followed an endo-atmospheric (within earth atmosphere, at altitude below 100 kilometers) non-ballistic trajectory during the test flight.
