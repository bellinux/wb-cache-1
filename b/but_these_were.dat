5|$|Another 27 {{issues of}} Amazing Stories Quarterly {{appeared}} from Ziff-Davis from 1940 to 1943, {{and also from}} 1949 to 1951, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> not original magazines, only rebound issues of Amazing Stories.|$|E

5|$|After Ranga Rao died in 1801, {{there were}} efforts to merge Bobbili with Vizianagaram <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> thwarted and a lasting {{settlement}} of the property was made with the adopted son of Ranga Rao. Rayadappa and his son Svetachalapti who succeeded in 1830 and lived till 1862 managed their property very well. In {{the middle of the}} 19th century, successors of this lineage constructed the present Bobbili Fort, following their improved economic conditions.|$|E
5|$|Courageous was {{initially}} fitted only with low-angle directors for her guns, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> replaced by dual-purpose directors {{when she was}} refitted in 1930. (Glorious, completed later, had hers from the beginning.) Neither ship was fitted with radar before its early loss.|$|E
5|$|During the Flavian dynasty, the princes of the Iazyges {{were trained}} in the Roman army, officially as an honor, but in reality serving as a hostage, because the kings held {{absolute}} power over the Iazyges. There were offers from the princes of the Iazyges to supply troops, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> denied based on the fear that they might revolt or desert in a war.|$|E

50|$|Not all {{of these}} {{patterns}} will necessarily continue to hold in the future (while Tammany Hall has never revived), <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> {{a few of the}} old patterns from which new patterns will emerge.

5|$|Eventually, {{unable to}} find any {{evidence}} of a fort in the area, the soldiers went back down Fishing Creek to Bloomsburg. Dissatisfied with their findings, the soldiers conducted a search of several unfortified homes in northern Columbia County. They captured a number of residents of Sugarloaf Township on August 31, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> soon released.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the Swiss Air Force {{acquired}} 20 British Aerospace Hawk Mk.66s {{to provide}} an interim solution to its jet training requirements, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> retired in 2003 and sold to Finland. The Mirages ended their service {{in the second half}} of the 1990s, with the last Mirage fighter retired in 1999 and the final Mirage reconnaissance jet in December 2003.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} all major {{warships}} of her day, Dreadnought was fitted with anti-torpedo nets, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> removed {{early in the}} war, since they caused considerable loss of speed and were easily defeated by torpedoes fitted with net-cutters.|$|E

5|$|The 890th {{began to}} fly Lend-Lease B-25 Mitchells {{in the spring}} of 1944 and was itself re-designated as the 890th Bomber Aviation Regiment on 26 December 1944. The 362nd APDD was formed in early 1944 with four Pe-8s {{received}} from the other two regiments, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> returned {{in the spring of}} 1944, when the regiment began to convert to the Lend-Lease Mitchells.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} {{is divided into}} five talukas: Mangalore, Bantwal, Puttur, Sullia, and Belthangady. It used to include four northern talukas (Udupi, Kundapur, Karkala and Byndoor), <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> separated in August 1997 to form Udupi district. Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Kasaragod are often called Tulu Nadu, as Tulu is the majority language in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{significant}} {{statues of}} Vishnu {{are difficult to}} explain and to position inside other surviving caves. One theory states {{that some of the}} caves must have represented the Vaishnavism tradition. Another theory by some scholars such as Moti Chandra suggests that the island once had open air structural Hindu temples in addition to the caves, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> the first victims of art destruction.|$|E

5|$|The {{station has}} a single large concourse, {{separate}} from the train shed. Originally, there were no seats installed there to deter vagrants and crime, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> added following complaints from passengers. A few remnants of the older station remain: two Portland stone entrance lodges and a war memorial. A statue of Robert Stephenson by Carlo Marochetti, previously in the old ticket hall, stands in the forecourt.|$|E
5|$|The story {{follows the}} hero {{and the young}} heroine {{as they attempt to}} thwart the Dark Lord of Glaive and his sorcerer assistant, Julius, from {{destroying}} the Tree of Mana and dooming their world. The game was released with many familiar elements of the Final Fantasy series, such as Chocobos, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> later changed to feature common enemies and the gameplay style of the Mana series.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} controversy over hedgehogs on the Uists. Hedgehogs are not {{native to the}} islands, but were introduced in the 1970s to reduce garden pests. Their spread posed {{a threat to the}} eggs of ground nesting wading birds. In 2003 Scottish Natural Heritage undertook culls of hedgehogs in the area, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> halted in 2007; trapped animals are now relocated to the mainland.|$|E

5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E
5|$|After {{missions}} {{discovered the}} reality of the harsh nature of the planet's surface, attention shifted towards other targets such as Mars. There {{have been a number of}} proposed missions afterwards however, and many of these involve the little-known upper atmosphere. The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the atmosphere, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> battery-powered and lasted for only about two Earth days each before running out of power. Since then, there has been no exploration of the upper atmosphere. In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed a balloon that would be capable of staying in the upper atmosphere for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.|$|E
5|$|After the siege, Maltese {{military}} engineer Girolamo Cassar drew up {{plans to}} reduce Mdina's size by half {{and turning it}} into a fortress, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> never implemented due to protests by the city's nobles. The city's main gate was reconstructed in the early 17th century, but the next major alterations were not made until the 1650s, when the large De Redin Bastion was built at the centre of the land front. Despite these modifications, by 1658 there were also proposals to abandon or demolish the entire fortress due to its state of disrepair, although these plans were opposed by the locals. In the late 17th century, some of Mdina's medieval double walls began to be encased in sloping ramparts.|$|E
