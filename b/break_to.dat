50|$|He {{notes that}} Arabic is suited to showing {{relations}} with more conciseness {{than many other}} languages because of the greater flexibility of verbs and nouns.

5|$|Although Camet {{successfully}} completed {{all of the}} trials required of him by the nascent Argentine Olympic Committee, he {{did not attend the}} 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, although his name was on the official register as a non-participant.

5|$|Both teams {{struggled}} {{to put a}} flowing move together in the opening exchanges, but it was United who had the better chances, both falling to Ronaldo. The first came in the seventhminute: having been played the ball by Michael Carrick, Ronaldo turned away from Piqué {{on the edge of}} the centre circle, before hitting a shot just wide from almost 40yards; the second saw the ball <b>break</b> <b>to</b> Ronaldo after Anderson and Patrice Evra had linked up well down the left flank. The Portuguese winger controlled the ball on the chest before hitting the ball just past the far post.|$|E

40|$|This article {{introduces}} and {{explores the}} construct of pro-social rule breaking. Pro-social rule breaking is rooted in a desire to promote {{the welfare of the}} organization or one of its stakeholders. The first two studies used interview data to identify three primary types of pro-social rule break-ing: rule <b>breaking</b> <b>to</b> perform one’s responsibilities more efficiently, rule <b>breaking</b> <b>to</b> help a sub-ordinate or colleague, and rule <b>breaking</b> <b>to</b> provide good customer service. A third study used a scenario-based laboratory experiment. It found that the likelihood of pro-social rule breaking was positively related to job autonomy, coworker behavior, and risk-taking propensity...|$|R

5|$|Early in the 1889–90 Australian season, Trumble {{endured a}} period where {{he was not able}} to take wickets consistently. With {{selection}} of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch <b>break</b> <b>to</b> revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket.|$|E

5|$|In July, Spears {{announced}} her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline, {{whom she had}} met three months before. As Federline had only recently ended his relationship with actress Shar Jackson, who was pregnant with their second child, this engagement {{was the subject of}} extensive media coverage. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement. In October 2004, the singer announced she would be taking another career <b>break</b> <b>to</b> start a family.|$|E
5|$|Later, in April 2003, No Doubt {{went into}} hiatus {{to take a}} <b>break</b> <b>to</b> spend time with their {{families}} before starting to compile Everything in Time; The Singles 1992–2003, a greatest hits album featuring songs from their previous studio albums; and Boom Box, a box set compiling The Singles 1992–2003, Everything in Time, The Videos 1992–2003 and Live in the Tragic Kingdom, which would all be released on the same date. The main reason to go into hiatus was that, in early 2003, lead singer Gwen Stefani started work on her 1980s-inspired new wave/dance-pop music side project, under which she released two solo albums: Love. Angel. Music. Baby. on November 22, 2004 and The Sweet Escape on December 4, 2006.|$|E

5|$|There Daniel takes part in {{a number}} of experiments, {{including}} the exploration of the diminishing effects of gravity with changes in elevation, the transfusion of blood between dogs and Wilkins' attempts to create a philosophical language. Daniel soon becomes disgusted with some of the practices of the older natural philosophers (which include vivisection of animals) and visits Newton during his experiments with color and white light. They attempt to return to Cambridge, but again plague expels the students. Daniel returns to his father; however, his arrival on the outskirts of London coincides with {{the second day of the}} Fire of London. Drake, taken by religious fervour, dies atop his house as the King blows it up to create a fire <b>break</b> <b>to</b> prevent further spread of the fire.

5|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{principal}} of Comilla Victoria College, Khan developed {{a special interest in}} grassroots actions. Between 1954 and 1955, he took a <b>break</b> <b>to</b> work as director of the Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) Programme. However, he was not satisfied with the development approach adopted in the programme that was limited to the training of villagers. In 1958, he went to Michigan State University to acquire education and training in rural development. Returning in 1959, he established the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development (PARD) at Comilla on 27 May 1959 and was appointed as its founding director. He also laid foundations for the Comilla Cooperative Pilot Project in 1959. In 1963, he received a Ramon Magsaysay Award from the Government of the Philippines for his services in rural development.

5|$|In June 2016, Ivan Lendl {{agreed to}} return to his former role as Murray's coach. Murray started his grass season at the 2016 Aegon Championships as the 1st seed and the {{defending}} champion. Murray defeated Nicolas Mahut in straight sets despite facing a set point in the first set and three set points in the second set. He then defeated his countryman Aljaž Bedene in straight sets. He then had three set wins over Kyle Edmund, another countryman, and No. 5 seed Marin Čilić. In the final he was down a set and a <b>break</b> <b>to</b> 3rd seed Milos Raonic. Murray still managed to come back and win a record 5th Queen's Club Championships and it was also his 2nd title in 2016. Murray then played at the third major of the year at the 2016 Wimbledon Championships as the 2nd seed. Murray had straight set wins over Liam Broady, Lu Yen-hsun, John Millman, and Nick Kyrgios in the first four rounds. Murray then defeated 12th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in five sets in the quarterfinal and 10th seed Tomáš Berdych in straight sets to reach his third straight major final.

5|$|Müller {{returned}} from his post-World Cup <b>break</b> <b>to</b> sign another contract extension, this time extending his stay at Bayern until 2015. As with all of Bayern's World Cup participants, he missed much of pre-season, and his first match back was the Supercup against Schalke 04 on 7 August. He was named in the starting 11, and scored the opening goal in a 2–0 win. Two weeks later he scored the opening goal of Bayern's league season in a 2–1 home win against VfL Wolfsburg. Müller played in every match {{of the first half}} of the season, usually as a starter, but as the team struggled for results, Müller was unable to match the previous season's goalscoring exploits, being dropped to the bench, and even receiving a telling off from Louis van Gaal after missing an easy chance in a 2–0 defeat against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in August. He was philosophical about this dip in form, though, and after eight league games without a goal, he scored in a 4–1 win against Eintracht Frankfurt on 27 November; He followed that by scoring in consecutive league and cup wins against VfB Stuttgart three weeks later. These goals took his tally to eight goals in all competitions and included a spectacular goal to open the scoring in a 2–0 Champions League victory against Roma on 15 September.|$|E
5|$|Rapid, however, appealed, {{citing the}} alleged injury to their player. The initial appeal was {{dismissed}} by UEFA, but a second appeal {{from the club}} was upheld and a replay was ordered to take place at least 150 kilometres (90 miles) from Glasgow. The Celtic board acquiesced to this decision in spite of considered opinion that Celtic should withdraw from the tournament on principle. As such, the match at Parkhead was declared void and a third match was held in Manchester at Old Trafford. Celtic lost 0–1, the goal coming on 18 minutes when after Roy Aitken had hit the post with an effort for Celtic, Rapid immediately caught Celtic on the <b>break</b> <b>to</b> score the only goal of the game. Worse, two Celtic fans assaulted Rapid Wien players; one fan running onto the pitch and accosting the goalkeeper during the game, whilst at full-time another Rapid player was kicked by a fan.
