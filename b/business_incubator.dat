5|$|Youngstown's downtown, {{which once}} underscored the community's {{economic}} difficulties, is {{a site of}} new business growth. The Youngstown <b>Business</b> <b>Incubator</b> (YBI), {{in the heart of}} the downtown, houses several start-up technology companies that have received office space, furnishings, and access to utilities. Some companies supported by the incubator have earned recognition, and a few are starting to outgrow their current space. One such company–Turning Technologies–has been rated by Inc. Magazine as the fastest-growing privately held software company in the United States and 18th fastest-growing privately held company overall. In an effort to keep such companies downtown, the YBI secured approval to demolish a row of vacant buildings nearby to clear space for expansion. The project will be funded by a $2 million federal grant awarded in 2006. In 2014, the YBI was ranked as the number 1 university associated <b>business</b> <b>incubator</b> in the world by the Swedish UBII (University <b>Business</b> <b>Incubator</b> Index). In 2015, the YBI was the top University Associated Incubator in North America, and came in second to the Dublin Enterprise & Technology Centre, also known as the Guinness Enterprise Centre, in Dublin.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSustainable {{development}} {{is an important}} dimension for <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> to improve tenant-businesses in the coffee value chain. This study focuses on <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> addressing social and economic dimensions of sustainability in developing countries. <b>Business</b> <b>incubators</b> are perceived as important mechanisms for sustainable development as they involve relevant stakeholders and activities to interact each other. Prior research highlights the gap of theoretical explanation to understand <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> linked to sustainable development. The {{purpose of this study}} is to provide a conceptual approach based on resource dependence theory to better understand strategies in interdependencies to address power imbalance issues of <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> in developing countries. Strategies such as integration and coordination should be implemented in the incubator management to increase mutual dependencies and improve relationships to secure resources, thereby, providing quality services for tenants. Relationships with relevant partner organizations such as universities, business centers, and public research organizations represent opportunities for <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> in boosting sustainable business development...|$|R

The article evaluates three not-for-profit managed <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> from different parts of Finland.

The ‘laboratories’ that have been chosen {{in order to test}} the theoretical framework are the <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> at the European Space Agency (ESA). The methodology is a multiple case study research of ESA’s <b>business</b> <b>incubators.</b> The reason why we have chosen them is that the same ESA’s successful business incubation programme is applied in different <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> across different nations. That provides a unique empirical setting in which to test the internal and construction validity of our principles, neutralizing the influence of the hosting country. The final result is not a ‘statistical generalization’ regarding a population of <b>business</b> <b>incubators,</b> but an empirically, multiple case study based, ‘analytical generalization’ of the proposed theoretical framework. Such theoretical framework appears effective in explaining the success of ESA’s business incubation programme. The collected evidences also have practical implications as we expect the framework can be applied by policy makers approaching the business incubation tool and extended to non-profit, publicly funded <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> – the overwhelming majority of operating <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> – that might take advantage from aligning their development strategy to our proposed framework...|$|R
