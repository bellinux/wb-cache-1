5000|$|Urschel's red <b>beet</b> <b>harvester</b> and topper [...] {{manufactured}} by the Scott Viner company and {{known as a}} Scott-Urschel product [...] was released in 1930, and was a success. At that time, the company employed 15 men {{who worked in the}} construction and perfection of Urschel's inventions. Only model-building experimentation took place at Urschel Laboratories, while production was handled by industrial producers. However, William Urschel planned to add 3000 sq ft of floor space to his factory with the intention to perform some manufacturing at the plant. The green bean picker was still in development as of 1930, at which point William Urschel was also perfecting a sugar <b>beet</b> <b>harvester,</b> expected to be his among his most profitable products. Urschel had also perfected an onion topper and a vegetable peeler. By November 1936, Urschel Laboratories had manufactured several canning machines for Chivers and Sons, which was in negotiations to purchase a red <b>beet</b> <b>harvester.</b> At that time, Urschel Laboratories was working on the first machine that would be used to cut celery for canning.|$|E

Beginning in 1923, Urschel's company began development of a mechanical green bean harvester, with backing from the Scott Viner company in Columbus, Ohio. William Urschel is the first known man to attempt to build such a machine. In 1925, Urschel began working on a red <b>beet</b> <b>harvester</b> and topper.|$|E

The [...] <b>beet</b> <b>harvester</b> lifts the root, and removes excess soil from the root {{in a single pass}} over the field. A modern harvester is typically able to cover six rows at the same time. The beets are dumped into trucks as the harvester rolls down the field, and then delivered to the factory.

40|$|A {{postal survey}} of farmers in Mid Canterbury {{was carried out}} in 1977 in order to {{ascertain}} the interest, resources and attitudes of farmers to the growing of sugar beet in their region. An extremely high net valid response rate was obtained to the survey. Results indicated that there was considerable interest in sugar beet production. Negative attitudes appeared to be associated with unfamiliarity with the crop. Greater interest was apparent on intensive cropping farms than on mixed cropping and livestock farms; greater interest was also displayed by younger as opposed to older farmers. Expanding labour requirements associated with sugar beet production was considered a constraint by some of the interested growers. The use of contractors appeared a favoured alternative in gaining access to additional machinery such as a sugar <b>beet</b> <b>harvester</b> and a precision drill. Commitment to a minimum area of beet for an initial period of years did not appear a major constraint to those interested in the crop. A strong interest was expressed in the use of by products for livestock feed. Eight percent of respondents had grown fodder beet on a regular basis. Most respondents indicated they required more advice on crop husbandry if they were to commence sugar beet production...|$|E

He worked in Valladolid for the Castilian union of sugar <b>beet</b> <b>harvesters</b> and joined the Acción Nacional during his youth. He was greatly influenced by Enrique Herrera Oria, brother of the founder of the Asociación Nacional Catolica de Propagandistas and editor of El Debate, Ángel Herrera Oria. Enrique Herrera believed that Communism, Freemasonry and Judaism were working to destroy religion and the Fatherland, and encouraged Redondo to read the virulent anti-Jewish tract by Léon de Poncins, Las fuerzas secretas de la Revolucion.|$|R
40|$|Soil {{compaction}} is {{a complex}} mechanism which results in a decrease of soil porosity and an increase of soil strength. Such effects may reduce crop yield since they are harmful for root growth, germination, mesofauna and bacterial life. Soil compaction may also reduce hydraulic conductivity which {{increases the risk of}} runoff, contamination of surface water, erosion and emission of greenhouse gases due to anaerobic processes. In the context of sustainable agriculture, it is crucial to characterise the impact of the agricultural techniques on the compaction state in the arable layer due to machine traffic. For this purpose, Soil samples were taken in a Luvisol at different depths, on plots under longterm reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT). The impact of wheel traffic on the physical properties of the soils was also studied. The experimental approach consists in measuring traditional macroscopic soil properties such as bulk density and precompression stress, and combining them with pore size distribution obtained by mercury intrusion porosimetry. Automatic cone index measurements were initially performed to map the soil resistance and easily identify the sampling depths. The measurements revealed a plough pan at 30 -cm depth under both CT and RT. Nevertheless, the subsoil under RT showed pieces of evidence of a natural regeneration process of the microporosity. The impact of wheel traffic was studied in RT and CT plots. It was shown that the passage of heavy machine such as <b>beet</b> <b>harvester</b> coupled to water content close to the optimum proctor is clearly unfavourable in terms of compaction. The measurements revealed large modifications of soil structure in the topsoil of CT, whereas the soil structure slightly changes through depth. However, the latter remains the more problematic case since the soil will not be loosened by tillage anymore, resulting in strongly compacted soil years after years. In addition to the experimental approach, numerical modelling was used in order to predict the soil compaction. A finite element method was used and the soil behaviour was modelled by an elastoplastic law (modified Cam-Clay model). The model parameters were calibrated from the experimental measurements. The simulations allowed to compare the porosity and the surface deformation after wheel traffic with the experiments. The variations of machine weight and tyre pressure were numerically studied and it was showed that the machine weight has an influence in the topsoil and the subsoil, whereas the tyre pressure affects only the topsoil...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} Soil Framework Directive COM(2006) 232 requires Member States {{to identify}} areas {{at risk of}} erosion, decline in organic matter, salinisation, compaction, sealing and landslides, {{as well as to}} set up an inventory of contaminated sites. The present project aims to identify the susceptibility to compaction of soils of the Walloon Region (Belgium) and to recommend good farming practices avoiding soil compaction as far as possible. Within this scope, the concept of precompression stress (Pc) (Horn and Fleige, 2003) was used. Pc is defined as the maximum major principal stress that a soil horizon can withstand against any applied external vertical stress. If applied stress is higher than Pc, the soil enters in a plastic state, not easily reversible. For a given soil, the intensity of soil compaction is mainly due to the applied load which depends on vehicle characteristics (axle load, tyre dimensions, tyre inflation pressure, and vehicle velocity). To determine soil precompression stress, pedotransfert functions of Lebert and Horn (1991) defined at two water suctions (pF 1. 8 and 2. 5) were used. Parameters required by these functions were found within several databases (Aardewerk and Digital Map of Walloon Soils) and literature. The validation of Pc was performed by measuring stress-strain relationships using automatic oedometers. Stresses of 15. 6, 31, 3, 62. 5, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 kPa were applied for 10 min each. In this study, the compaction due to beet harvesters was considered because the axle load can exceed 10 tons and these machines are often used during wet conditions. The compaction at two depth levels was considered: 30 and 50 cm. Compaction of topsoil was not taken into account because, under conventional tillage, the plough depth is lower than 25 cm. Before and after the passage of the machines, following measurements were performed: granulometry, density, soil moisture, pF curve, Atterberg limits, [...] . The software Soilflex (Keller et al., 2007) was used to estimate the distribution of the vertical stresses sigma z in the soil. Comparison was performed between sigma z and Pc. The following data simulated the passage of a <b>beet</b> <b>harvester</b> machine (mass: 23 580 kg; load: 18 000 kg) in a silty soil located in Hesbaye and classified as Aba (Sirjacobs et al., 2000). The passage of the machine would create a Pc of around 100 kPa at 30 cm depth, while the stress induced by the machine would reach 240 kPa. In the field borders, where more vehicle traffic was usually observed and where the soil was over consolidated, Pc would reach 180 kPa, while sigma z would be 220 kPa. In both cases, the risk of compaction created by the passage of the machine would be high...|$|E
40|$|Compaction of {{farmland}} can {{in many cases}} be negative. A poorer water infiltration in the soil profile, bad conditions for root growth, slower decomposition rate of organic material, {{and an increase in}} traction power are some of the negative effects. The most serious compaction is the one appearing below the depth of tillage, as it will exist for many years. The factors having the greatest influence on the amount of soil compaction is the wheel load, the tyre equipment used, the tyre inflation pressure and the water content in the soil. Factors discussed in this report are wheel load, tyre inflation pressure, the stress in the soil, the stress distribution in the contact area and the impact of these parameters on the amount of compaction. Three different experiments were carried out on three sites in the autumn in 2002. The first experiment was carried out at Svenstorp farm in southern Sweden. During dry conditions the stress and the deformation in the soil was measured under a 3 -row, a 6 -row and a 9 -row sugar <b>beet</b> <b>harvester</b> that were driving with different loads. The 6 -row harvester was also driven with different tire inflation pressures. Saturated hydraulic conductivity, macroporosity and bulk density was measured in the topsoil after a single pass with the harvesters. The second experiment took place at Krenkerup farm in southern Denmark. Two different systems for sugar beet harvesting were evaluated. The first system contained one big harvester only that had a loading capacity of 28 tons and a total weight of 55 tons. Because of the great loading capacity, it was able to bring the sugar beets {{to the end of the}} field. The other system contained a smaller harvester, with a total weight of 27 tons and two field trailers that were supporting the harvester all the time. The measurements were concentrated on stress and deformation in the subsoil and also stress and stress distribution in the topsoil under the different tyres. The last experiment took place at Ultuna, Uppsala, Sweden. In this experiment the stress and the stress distribution in the topsoil was measured when driving with different wheel loads and tyre inflation pressures. The results from Svenstorp showed the positive effects of a reduced tyre inflation pressure on soil stress, saturated hydraulic conductivity and macro porosity in the topsoil. Traffic by the 6 -row harvester, driving with a high tyre inflation pressure, was resulting in the lowest rate of saturated hydraulic conductivity, independently of the load. Also the boogie wheels of the 3 - row harvester were resulting in low infiltration rates, independently of the load. The measurements at Krenkerup showed that one passage over the soil with the big harvester deformed the soil more at both 30 cm and 70 cm depth, than one passage with the small harvester followed by the field trailer. The highest stress both at 30 cm and 70 cm depth was measured under one of the three tyres of the big harvester. There was a very even stress distribution between the three axles of the field trailer. Measurements at Ultuna showed that a higher wheel load resulted in a higher stress in the topsoil, even though the tyre inflation pressure was kept constant. A lower tyre inflation pressure resulted in a more even stress distribution in the contact area. The main conclusions of this study are: 1) A reduced tyre inflation pressure will greatly reduce compaction of the topsoil. 2) The deformation in the soil was greater after passing once with a 55 ton harvester than after passing once with a 27 ton harvester plus a field trailer. 3) An increase in wheel load resulted in a higher stress in the topsoil, even though the tyre inflation pressure was kept the same...|$|E
40|$|The Bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} changes in {{technology}} of planting sugar beet. In the Czech Republic, sugar beet is {{the most widely used}} raw material for sugar production since the mid- 19 th century. The sugar beet production and production of sugar {{are one of the most}} important segments of agro-food complex, but nowadays sugar beet is also strategic crop of which feed and fertilizers are being made. It is also a source of renewable energy in the form of anhydrous ethyl alcohol and stillage to be processed in biogas plants. Sugar produced in the Czech Republic has a similar quality to the best producers in the EU. In the last two years, Czech growers achieved yields of about 80 t. ha- 1. The yield is constantly increasing, annually by an average of more than two tons. Ploughing has always been a priority during the processing of sugar beet. In the course of time, is rather recomended on heavy soils to use ploughless technology. Nowadays genetically monogerm seed varieties are being used for sowing. The seeds are sown for finite distances by precision seeders. Harvesting is carried out by self-propelled sugar <b>beet</b> <b>harvesters</b> with high-capacity containers. In the Czech Republic there have been only seven still functioning sugar factories, which belong to five major companies.

40|$|Compaction of arable soils is a {{consequence}} of tillage systems and agricultural machinery traffic year after year. Its negative effects on crop production and on the environment have been put into evidence by several studies. However, soil compaction is a complex phenomenon and the understanding of the involved mechanisms related to agricultural practices still remains limited. This contribution aims to study the influence of the interaction between traffic intensity and tillage system on soil compaction. Soil samples were taken from topsoil (0. 07 - 0. 25 m), plough pan (0. 30 - 0. 35 m) and subsoil (0. 35 – 0. 52 m), on plots under long-term reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT). For each tillage system, intensive traffic zones (IT) and non-intensive traffic zones (NT) were considered. Swelling index (Cs), compression index (Cc), precompression stress (Pc) obtained by oedometer test, porosity (n) and water content obtained by gravimetric determination were chosen to characterise the soil mechanical properties. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to study the effect of the depth, the tillage and the traffic intensity on the variables measured, with the water content as covariable. The results show that, after ten years of reconversion from CT to RT, the plough pan is still present in RT and its compaction appears as important as in CT (nRT- 30 cm = 36. 9 %, nCT- 30 cm = 38. 0 %, p-value = 0. 098). In subsoil, the compression index was high in CT, as well as in RT (CcRT = 0. 150 kPa- 1, CcCT = 0. 148 kPa- 1, p-value = 0. 617), involving that this layer remains susceptible to compaction under heavy loads. Moreover, the mean value of the precompression stress (meanPc = 92 ± 34 kPa) remains lower than stresses induced by heavy machines such as <b>beet</b> <b>harvesters.</b> The results also show that the presence of two traffic zones induces a spatial heterogeneity in the field (CcIT = 0. 138 kPa- 1; CcNT = 0. 154 kPa- 1, p-value = 0. 031). These main results could be used in computational modelling to develop decision support systems to mitigate the effects of soil compaction...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} a part of a larger project, which tries to {{estimate}} the risk of soil compaction in the subsoil when using heavy sugar <b>beet</b> <b>harvesters,</b> in relation to soil type and water content in the field at harvest time. The {{purpose of this study was}} to follow the changes in soil water con tent during the growing period, in a spring sown crop and in sugar beets. Two sites with different soil types were used during the period of growth 1997. The method used was to take soil samples for gravimetric water content every two weeks in 10 cm layers to 1 m depth. Saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention was determined on soil cores in each 10 cm layer to l m depth. Meteorological data was collected from nearby weather stations. The calculated evaporation from the crop was compared with the potential. The water content in the subsoil changed more slowly than in the topsoil. The cereal crop absorbed more water than the sugar beets until the middle of the summer, but during late summer and autumn the water content in the soil was lower in the sugar beets than in the cereal crop. At both sites the profile was practically emptied on plant accessible water down to l meter during the summer. At one of the sites the calculated transpiration from 6 July to 8 August was approximately half of the potential, which indicates that the crops suffered from drought. At harvest time of the cereal crop the soil had low water con tent. The water content in the sugar beet field was larger at the time of harvest of the sugar beets. At harvest time of the cereal crop there was little risk of subsoil compaction because of the low soil water content. At the time of sugar beet harvest there was probably a risk of subsoil compaction. A possibility to avoid compaction would be to harvest the sugar beets before an expected large rainfall, although some losses of sugar may occur during the storage of the sugar beets...|$|R
40|$|This {{work is a}} part of {{a larger}} project {{together}} with Danisco Sugar AB, which tries to prevent compaction in the subsoil when using heavy sugar beet harvesters. The work is based on measuring the water con tent during a growing season (1997) and to calculate the water content with the simulation model SOIL. After that, the water con tent has been simulated from weather data for a longer period, and the risk for compaction in the autumn has been calculated. Agriculture has gone through a lot of changes since the second world war, for example the machines have become larger and heavier. The purpose of the project was to examine how often soil compaction in the subsoil should arise by measuring and calculating the water con tent. We have measured the water content every 14 th day during the growing season 1997 on two sites: Elvireborg east of Landskrona and Kronoslätt dose to Hemmesdynge in the very south of Sweden. At Elvireborg sampling was made in sugar beets and spring wheat, and at Kronoslätt in sugar beets and spring barley. The soil at Elvireborg is a sandy day loam with a porosity of 38 % (vol/vol) with 18, 4 % (vol/vol) water at permanent wilting point and 15, 6 % plant available water. The soil has a good hydraulic conductivity in the topsoil (O - 30 cm), but much lower in {{the lower part of the}} subsoil (60 - 100 cm). During dry summers the hydraulic conductivity will improve by crack formation. Kronoslätt is a sandy loam with a porosity of 36, 7 % with 12, 6 % (vol/vol) water at permanent wilting point and 20, 9 % plant available water. Kronoslätt has a strongly reduced hydraulic conductivity in the subsoil (30 - 100 cm) in comparison with the topsoil (O - 30 cm). An opened cylinder drill or an Ultuna drill was used to take out the soil samples to determine the water content at every 10 th centimeter to one meter depth. Soil cores were sampled to one meter depth to determine saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention. The water content was used to calibrate the simulation model (SOIL). Weather data for 1997 was collected from Jordberga sugar factory for Kronoslätt and from Svalöv weather station for Elvireborg. In the simulations the daily mean values were used for temperature, precipitation and sun radiation. Calculations have been done for changes in water content in 1997 and for the period 1963 - 1988 with 1997 as a calibration year. The precompression stress (Casagrande, 1936) was determined at four water tensions, and a logarithmic function was made between precompression stress and water tension. By combining this function with the soil water simulation, the susceptibility to compaction was estimated. The cereal crops took up less water than the sugar beets, and the sugar beets took up water during a longer period of the year, depending on a longer growing season. In the end of July practically all plant available water in the profile had been used in 1997. The measured water con tent was sometimes below permanent wilting point and lower than the simulated values. However, in general there was good correlation between measured and simulated values. Calculations were also made for the vertical soil stress in the soil, for a wheel load of 8 tons and 220 kPa ground contact pressure corresponding to a fully loaded sugar <b>beet</b> <b>harvester.</b> The soil was considered susceptible to compaction when the stress at a certain depth was higher than the precompression stress of the soil at that specific water content. Driving late in the autumn involves a big risk of compaction of the subsoil both at Elvireborg and Kronoslätt. From the middle of October there was a compaction risk in the subsoil at 50 cm depth for half of the years. In the results over the whole year, the Elvireborg site was more susceptible to subsoil compaction than Kronoslätt. This could be due to Kronoslätt being a more compact soil with a higher precompression stress...|$|E

To assess the production potential of the farms, the authors determined the age structure of the machinery owned by the farmers and established the scale of investment in new equipment.
