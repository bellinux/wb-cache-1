Equipped with an embarked energy <b>buffer</b> for diesel <b>generator</b> support and utility grid interface, such a locomotive can be considered as a plug-in series hybrid vehicle. The driveline inductive components, like generator and motor windings and capacitive components like dc link capacitors can be used to provide STATCOM functions, and the energy buffer can be used for short-term grid support. The co-action of power electronics circuitries and diesel generator gives a possibility to observe the locomotive as a mobile versatile power plant for special rolling stock and emergency supply. With high power levels ranging from few hundred kilowatts to several megawatts, the locomotives can participate in large-scale power conditioning at standstill, bringing revenues to the operators even “off-line”.

40|$|In {{stochastic}} fluid models {{the drift}} {{at which the}} fluid level changes in the fluid <b>buffer</b> and the <b>generator</b> of the underlying process might depend on the discrete state {{of the system and}} on the fluid level itself. In this paper we analyse the stationary behaviour of finite buffer Markov fluid models in which the drift and the generator of the underlying continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) depends on both of these parameters. Especially, the case when the drift changes sign at a given fluid level is considered. This case requires a particular treatment, because at this fluid level probability mass might develop. When dealing with sign changes, new problems that were not addressed in previous works arises. The set of stationary equations is provided and a transformation of the unknowns is applied to obtain a solvable system description. Numerical examples introduce the behaviour of fluid systems with various discontinuities and sign changes of the drift...|$|R
40|$|Key {{instrumentation}} devices like counter/timers, analog-to-digital converters and encoders provide {{scalar data}} input. Many of them allow fast acquisitions, {{but do not}} provide hardware triggering or buffering mechanisms. A Linux 2. 4 kernel driver called Hook was developed at the ESRF as a generic software-triggered buffering interface. This work presents the portage of the ESRF Hook interface to the Linux 2. 6 kernel. The interface distinguishes two independent functional groups: trigger event generators and data channels. Devices in the first group create software events, like hardware interrupts generated by timers or external signals. On each event, one or more device channels on the second group are read and stored in kernel <b>buffers.</b> The event <b>generators</b> and data channels to be read are fully configurable before each sequence. Designed for fast acquisitions, the Hook implementation is well adapted to multi-CPU systems, where the interrupt latency is notably reduced. On heavily loaded dual-core PCs running standard (non real time) Linux, data can be taken at 1 KHz without losing events. Additional features include full integration into the /sys virtual file-system and hot-plug devices support...|$|R

40|$|Schmitt Trigger, first {{presented}} by Schmitt in 1938 is extensively used in Pulse Width Modulation Circuits, Sensors, Square Wave <b>Generators,</b> <b>buffers</b> and Sub threshold SRAM. It utilizes the fundamental concept of bi-stable state i. e. for {{positive and negative}} going input signals, Schmitt Trigger shows different switching thresholds which is termed as Hysteresis. Slew rate and bandwidth of the op-amp restricts the performance of Schmitt Trigger based on op-amp. Schmitt Trigger using Current Conveyors lack electronically tuned hysteresis level. CDTA and CCCDTA based Schmitt Trigger are comparatively less efficient owning to excessive use of passive elements, devoid of dual hysteresis operations using same topologies, absence of electronic controllability of output levels and threshold. Keeping all in knowledge,the {{purpose of this paper}} is to introduce adaptive or Super Schmitt trigger based on Operational Trans-conductance amplifier with many adjustable parameters to tame input values.

40|$|Introduction: Currently, the {{somatostatin}} imaging using DOTA conjugated peptides like DOTA-TOC, -NOC and -TATE are {{the common}} applications. Different 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator systems and synthesis modules are described separately. We describe a new full automated and standardized production of 68 Ga-DOTATOC. Methods: The module has to fit with components like the pre-conditioned C 18 purifications cartridge and the DOTATOC precursor solute in HEPES <b>buffer.</b> The <b>generator</b> was fractionally eluted in time steps of 30 sec. An elution profile was created {{and the time}} frame of the middle fraction was adjusted with the basis software and the flow rate of the peristaltic pump. The reaction vial was charged with 30 &micro;g DOTATOC solved in 100 &micro;l HEPES buffer (150 - 200 mg / 0. 1 ml) {{and placed in the}} heating block. The generator was eluted with 0. 6 N HCl and the reaction volume (~ 1 ml) was collected at the reaction vial after switching the valves V 2 and V 3 for 40 s. The labeling was performed under 95 &deg;C for 12 min at pH 3. 5 - 4. Purification was achieved by injecting the reaction mixture onto the C 18 cardridge, washing with 1, 5 ml H 2 O and 10 ml air. The 68 Ga-DOTATOC was transferred over a sterile filter to the product vial by elution with 1 ml ethanol and 9 ml of saline. Results: The tin dioxide generator we used was specified with an elution yield in 5 ml not less than 80 %. The rule of thumb prognosticates a durability of 200 elutions or 10 month. After ~ 70 elution the yield of our systems fall below the value of 80 %. The typical overall elution, labeling and purification procedure took less than 25 min. The non-ionic buffer HEPES was most effective and the optimal amount was ~ 160 mg. Using 33 &micro;g (23 nmol),the labeling yield was 60 %- 65 % and their radiochemical purity was &gt; 97 %. Conclusion: The combination of a 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator, produced under cGMP guidelines and a "Ready for use" automated module allows a standardized production with high radiochemical yields for 68 Ga-DOTATOC. This combination of both will provide the user with facile and reliable package for the preparation in routine clinical applications, especially und the aspect of cGLP and cGM...|$|R
40|$|Two way {{buffer system}} {{is a system that}} {{exhibits}} transfer of data using two buffers concurrently. It includes processes that synchronize to exchange data with each other along with executing certain delays between these synchronizations. In existing Tiny Two Way <b>Buffer</b> System, both <b>generators</b> produce packets in half duplex manner in no time, deterministic time, and non deterministic time. Analysis of the model for above time options leads the model in deadlock. The model can be out of the deadlock if timings in the model is incorporated in alternative fashion. The generators produce packets after a delay of 10 seconds. However, generator one has an initial shift of 5 seconds after which it begins sending a packet every 10 seconds. Hence, initial delay for generator one is 15 seconds and for generator two it is 10 seconds. Due to this initial shift, both generators produce packets alternatively and is deadlock free as the packets do not meet at the same time instant. Moreover, the existing system model is not concurrent and hence takes more time for packet transfer in every iteration. In this paper we have proposed a model of buffer system using an additional dummy buffer for transfer of data packets, we thus checking the model with various time models as no time, deterministic time and non deterministic time. The results of proposed model under above time models are in deadlock. We achieve deadlock free situation by introducing appropriate delay in various buffers of the proposed system, the delay timing is nondeterministic time. The new approach speeds up the transfer of packets, as a result the transfer of data becomes concurrent, deadlock free and hence the model proposed is time efficient. Simulation results shows that the proposed two way buffer system is fully concurrent and time efficient as compared to the existing buffer system.
