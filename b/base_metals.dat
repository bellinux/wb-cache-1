5|$|The {{element is}} {{normally}} found {{in association with}} other <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> such as copper and lead in ores. Zinc is a chalcophile, meaning the element has a low affinity for oxides and prefers to bond with sulfides.

Sphalerite, which {{is a form of}} zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the alonizing process {{is to improve the}} <b>base</b> <b>metal’s</b> heat and {{corrosion}} resistance by providing a protective diffusion layer of aluminum alloyed with the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> at the surface. This layer remains effective at all temperatures up to the melting point of the <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> Since the layer created is an alloy with the <b>base</b> <b>metal,</b> the layer cannot be removed without a machining process.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} a mixed powder on the wide gap {{transient}} liquid phase diffusion bonding of a directionally solidified Ni base superalloy, GTD- 111 was investigated. The mixed powder consisted of a mixture of a powdered Ni base filler (GNi- 3) and powdered <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> (GTD- 111). The range of the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> powder was 40 to 70 wt%. Bonding was performed at a temperature of 1463 K, using various holding time. In {{the case of a}} lower 50 wt%, the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> powders completely melted and <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> mating at the interface dissolved at an early time, and extent of dissolution of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> decreased with increasing mixing ratio. Liquid was eliminated by isothermal solidification, which was controlled by the diffusion of B into the <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> The solids in the bonded interlayer grew epitaxially from the mating <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> inward from the insert metal and the number of grain boundaries formed at the bonded interlayer corresponded with those of the <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> The finishing time for isothermal solidification was about 74 ks. In the case 60 wt % and higher, the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> powders partially melted and remained in the vicinity of bonded interlayer. The solid was formed from the remaining powder and <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> mating at the interface. Finally, the bonded interlayer underwent the poly-crystallization when isothermal solidification was complete. The contents of Al and Ti in the bonded interlayer with a holding of 74 ks were equal to that of the <b>base</b> <b>metal...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe new {{fabrication}} {{method to}} fabricate porous aluminum alloys with aligned unidirectional pores {{was invented by}} dipping pipes into semi-solid slurry. Pure aluminum pipes were dipped into Al- 4 mass% Cu liquid and semi-solid slurry of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> in an electric furnace. The <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and dipped pipes were cooled and solidified together in the air. The pipes were bonded to the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and the original shape of the pipes was maintained by using the semi-solid slurry of the <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> However, pipes are usually ruptured and buried in the liquid <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> during the process. On the other hand, {{it is possible to}} avoid the rupturing of pipes by using the semi-solid slurry because thermal damage of pipes can be reduced by an increase in solid fraction of the <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> The analysis results of Electron Probe MicroAnalyser showed that Cu diffused into grain boundaries of pipes, which decreased the melting temperature of surface of pipes. As a result, the α phase melted partly and then the pipes were bonded with the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> metallurgically. This dipping method can fabricate porous Al-Cu alloys with aligned unidirectional pores with porosity of 33 % when nineteen pipes are used...|$|R
5|$|The volcano and the {{surrounding}} Goat Rocks Wilderness, established in 1964, are named after the numerous mountain goats which live in the area. The variable climate of the wilderness area supports a host of wildlife, including marmots, pikas, deer, and elk. Various peaks within the wilderness can be climbed or scrambled, and other activities such as hiking are permitted. The area is rife with minerals and resources, including coal, cobalt, copper, and <b>base</b> <b>metals.</b>|$|E
5|$|In contrast, air {{furnaces}} (such as reverberatory furnaces) {{are naturally}} aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt mills for lead would {{be classified as}} blast furnaces. However, the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used {{in the production of}} commercial iron and steel, and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> smelting.|$|E
5|$|Because {{pure silver}} is very soft, most silver used for these {{purposes}} is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy tarnishing of {{silver in the}} presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly; <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> like zinc, cadmium, silicon, and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPlane {{bending fatigue}} tests were {{conducted}} using DLC-coated magnesium alloy AZ 61 with two different film elastic moduli in order to investigate the effect of film elastic modulus on fatigue behaviour. Fatigue strength was improved by DLC film where DLC film with larger elastic modulus was more effective to improve fatigue strength. Delaminations of DLC film from <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> were observed near crack initiation sites. The number of small cracks and delaminations was larger as film elastic moduluswas larger. By DLC film, stress near the boundary between <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and DLC film is redistributed in a specimen compared with parent material without DLC film. Stress is reduced at <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> but large stress occurs at DLC film due to the differenceof elastic moduli of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and DLC film. Stress at <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and DLC film near the boundary is calculated by FEM (Finite Element Method) analysis. FEM analysis showed that stress decreases at <b>base</b> <b>metal,</b> stress increases at DLC film and that the difference of stresses at <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and DLC film becomes larger when film elastic modulus is larger. It is considered that firmrestraint of slip deformation in <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> by DLC film is effective to improve fatigue strength and that large stress in DLC film would not give negative effect on fatigue strength...|$|R
50|$|In chemistry, {{the term}} <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> is used informally {{to refer to}} a metal that is easily {{oxidized}} or corroded, and reacts easily with dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form hydrogen.

Copper is considered a <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> as it is oxidized relatively easily, although it does not react with HCl. <b>Base</b> <b>metal</b> is commonly used in opposition to noble metal.|$|R

5|$|Few nickels had {{circulated}} {{in the western}} states before the 1880s (people there preferred silver and gold coins); interest in the new Liberty Head design had led to increasing use of nickels there. Good economic conditions and high demand for nickels for use in coin-operated devices caused the piece to circulate throughout the nation by 1900. That year, Mint Director George E. Roberts called on Congress to quintuple the Mint's appropriation to purchase <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> for striking into nickels and cents. At the time, statutory restrictions permitted production of cents and nickels only at Philadelphia; Roberts' request that Congress allow striking at the other mints was granted in 1906. The Denver and San Francisco Mints began striking nickels in 1912.|$|E
5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes, a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E

40|$|Diagnostic {{leaching}} is {{an analytical}} tool which was developed at Anglo American Research Laboratories {{to examine the}} deportment of gold in an ore, or any type of plant product or intermediary. In this study we {{make use of the}} same principle to study the effect of potential and pH on the dissolution of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> sulphides in a sulphate medium (sulphuric acid) at high temperatures (80 °C). This technique was developed to preferentially liberate a particular <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> from a complex ore. In this way, existing <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> sulphide extraction processes, especially where other unwanted <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> sulphides are present, can be optimised so as to yield substantial savings in operating costs. An oxidizing sulphuric acid leach at high temperatures will destroy pyrrhotite, uraninite, labile <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> sulphides (chalcopyrite, sphalerite, orpiment, marcasite), and to a lesser degree pyrite and arsenopyrite. From the results of this testwork it is possible to find an optimum between reagent consumption (MnO 2 and H 2 SO 4), temperature, leaching time, potential (Eh), costs and to a lesser degree pH, for the optimal extraction of the selective <b>base</b> <b>metal,</b> and/or gold. This can be achieved without the dissolution of less desirable <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> sulphides associated with the preferred mineral. © 1992. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Cyclic stress {{response}} and fracture behaviors of Alloy 617 <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> (BM) and Alloy 617 weld joints (WJ) are investigated under strain controlled {{low cycle fatigue}} (LCF) loading. Axial fully reversed total-strain controlled tests have been conducted at room temperature with total strain ranges of 0. 6, 0. 9, 1. 2, and 1. 5 %. At the all testing conditions, weld joint specimens have shown higher peak stresses than the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> specimens, whereas the plastic strain accumulation of the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> specimens is comparatively {{higher than those of}} the weld joint specimens. The cyclic {{stress response}} behavior of both <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and weld joint specimens revealed initial cyclic hardening during first small number of cycles followed by progressive softening to failure. Higher strain amplitudes decreased the fatigue lives for both <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and weld joint specimens; subsequently weld joint specimens had lower fatigue resistances relative to <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> specimens. Furthermore, the cracking in weld joint specimens initiated in the weld metal (WM) region. The crack initiation and propagation showed transgranular mode for both <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and weld joint specimens; especially weld joint specimens showed a wedge type crack initiation about 45 degrees to the loading direction because of the dendritic structure...|$|R

25|$|Two {{processes}} {{play a role}} in {{a solder}} joint formation: interaction between the substrate and molten solder, and solid-state growth of intermetallic compounds. The <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> dissolves in the molten solder in an amount depending on its solubility in the solder. The active constituent of the solder reacts with the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> with a rate dependent on the solubility of the active constituents in the <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> The solid-state reactions are more complex – the formation of intermetallics can be inhibited by changing the composition of the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> or the solder alloy, or by using a suitable barrier layer to inhibit diffusion of the metals.|$|R
