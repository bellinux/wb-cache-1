5|$|The {{definition}} {{would have}} considered {{a pair of}} objects to be a double planet system if each component independently satisfied the planetary criteria and the common center of gravity of the system (known as the <b>barycenter)</b> was located outside of both bodies. Pluto and Charon {{would have been the}} only known double planet in the Solar System. Other planetary satellites (like Earth and its moon) might be in hydrostatic equilibrium, but would still not have been defined as a component of a double planet, since the <b>barycenter</b> of the system lies within the more massive celestial body (the Earth).|$|E
5|$|In a draft {{resolution}} for the IAU definition of planet, both Pluto and Charon {{would have been}} considered dwarf planets in a binary system, given that they both satisfied the mass and shape requirements for dwarf planets and revolved around a common center of mass located between the two bodies (rather than within one of the bodies). The IAU currently states that Charon is not considered to be a dwarf planet and is just a satellite of Pluto, although the idea that Charon might qualify to be a dwarf planet in its own right may be considered at a later date. The location of the <b>barycenter</b> depends not only on the relative masses of the bodies, but also on the distance between them; the <b>barycenter</b> of the Sun–Jupiter orbit, for example, lies outside the Sun.|$|E

We also show in [35] that, in practice, a robust computation {{of the mean}} trend is obtained by averaging two envelopes: a first envelope interpolates the even indexed <b>barycenters,</b> and a second envelope interpolates the odd indexed <b>barycenters.</b> Compared to other approaches the 2 T-EMD algorithm is simpler, has a lighter computational cost, and enables both mono and multivariate decompositions without {{any change in the}} core of the algorithm.|$|R
5|$|Pluto {{has five}} known moons: Charon (the largest, with a {{diameter}} {{just over half}} that of Pluto), Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the <b>barycenter</b> of their orbits does not lie within either body.|$|E
5|$|The motions as {{described}} above are simplifications. Due to the movement of Earth around the Earth–Moon center of mass, the apparent path of the Sun wobbles slightly, with {{a period of about}} one month. Due to further perturbations by the other planets of the Solar System, the Earth–Moon <b>barycenter</b> wobbles slightly around a mean position in a complex fashion. The ecliptic is actually the apparent path of the Sun throughout the course of a year.|$|E
5|$|Pluto's {{orbital period}} is {{presently}} about 248 years. Its orbital characteristics are substantially {{different from those}} of the planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to a flat reference plane called the ecliptic. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is moderately inclined relative to the ecliptic (over 17°) and moderately eccentric (elliptical). This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto's orbit lies nearer the Sun than Neptune's. The Pluto–Charon <b>barycenter</b> came to perihelion on September 5, 1989, and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.|$|E

The correlation between <b>barycenters,</b> Jensen’s inequality and convexity is {{studied in the}} integral case.

5|$|There {{had also}} been {{criticism}} of the proposed definition of double planet: at present the Moon {{is defined as a}} satellite of the Earth, but over time the Earth-Moon <b>barycenter</b> will drift outwards (see tidal acceleration) and could eventually become situated outside of both bodies. This development would then upgrade the Moon to planetary status at that time, according to the redefinition. The time taken for this to occur, however, would be billions of years, long after many astronomers expect the Sun to expand into a red giant and destroy both Earth and Moon.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{interactions}} of galaxies {{with each other}} and clusters cause a significant scatter in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The peculiar velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the mass of virialized objects in the Universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies (such as the Andromeda Galaxy) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common <b>barycenter,</b> and redshift maps of clusters showing a Fingers of God effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution. This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the mass to light ratio (the ratio of a galaxy's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities), an important tool for measuring dark matter.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{the only}} planet whose <b>barycenter</b> with the Sun lies outside {{the volume of the}} Sun, though by only 7% of the Sun's radius. The average {{distance}} between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 millionkm (about 5.2 times the average distance between Earth and the Sun, or 5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every 11.86years. This is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance between the two largest planets in the Solar System. The elliptical orbit of Jupiter is inclined 1.31° compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.048, Jupiter's distance from the Sun varies by 75 millionkm between its nearest approach (perihelion) and furthest distance (aphelion).|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} general theory {{to address a}} consensus-based {{combination}} of estimations in a parallelized or distributed estimation setting. Taking into account the possibility of very discrepant estimations, instead of a full consensus we consider a "wide consensus" procedure. The approach {{is based on the}} consideration of trimmed <b>barycenters</b> in the Wasserstein space of probability distributions on R^d with finite second order moments. We include general existence and consistency results as well as characterizations of <b>barycenters</b> of probabilities that belong to (non necessarily elliptical) location and scatter familes. On these families, the effective computation of <b>barycenters</b> and distances can be addressed through a consistent iterative algorithm. Since, once a shape has been chosen, these computations just depend on the locations and scatters, the theory can be applied to cover with great generality a wide consensus approach for location and scatter estimation or for obtaining confidence regions.

5|$|The Moon and Earth orbit {{a common}} <b>barycenter</b> every 27.32days {{relative}} to the background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, {{the period of the}} synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of planets {{orbiting}} a star, {{the mass of the}} star and all its satellites are calculated to be at a single point called the <b>barycenter.</b> The paths of all the star's satellites are elliptical orbits about that <b>barycenter.</b> Each satellite in that system will have its own elliptical orbit with the <b>barycenter</b> at one focal point of that ellipse. At any point along its orbit, any satellite will have a certain value of kinetic and potential energy with respect to the <b>barycenter,</b> and that energy is a constant value at every point along its orbit. As a result, as a planet approaches periapsis, the planet will increase in speed as its potential energy decreases; as a planet approaches apoapsis, its velocity will decrease as its potential energy increases.|$|E

25|$|The {{center of}} mass plays an {{important}} role in astronomy and astrophysics, where it is commonly referred to as the <b>barycenter.</b> The <b>barycenter</b> is the point between two objects where they balance each other; it is the {{center of mass}} where two or more celestial bodies orbit each other. When a moon orbits a planet, or a planet orbits a star, both bodies are actually orbiting around a point that lies away from the center of the primary (larger) body. For example, the Moon does not orbit the exact center of the Earth, but a point on a line between the center of the Earth and the Moon, approximately 1,710km (1,062miles) below the surface of the Earth, where their respective masses balance. This is the point about which the Earth and Moon orbit as they travel around the Sun. If the masses are more similar, e.g., Pluto and Charon, the <b>barycenter</b> will fall outside both bodies.|$|E
