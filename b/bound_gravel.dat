40|$|As {{part of this}} {{research}} project, a test stretch with a sub-base with a hydraulic binder of sand (hydraulically bound sand sub-base) was set up. The project aimed to observe the filling behaviour of the base {{as well as its}} characteristics after it had been laid compared to a hydraulically <b>bound</b> <b>gravel</b> base in accordance with ZTVT. The grading curve of the chosen sand lay within grading envelope 'A' as designated by the supplement for hydraulically bound sand sub-base. A blast furnace cement HOZ 35 L was used as a binder. In particular, extended suitability tests were used to investigate the strengths, frost resistance and initial stability of the mixed materials. The material mixture for hydraulically bound sand sub-base requires a higher binder content compared with that for hydraulically <b>bound</b> <b>gravel</b> base, though from a technical point of view, a material can be produced which meets ZTVT requirements. When the hydraulically bound sand sub-base was laid it became clear that compaction with the heavy-duty screed of a road finishing machine at a thickness of 15 cm was generally sufficient to achieve the specified rate of compaction. Owing to different weather conditions during the construction of the test stretch, there were two qualitatively different areas in the hydraulically bound sand sub-base section. The control test section with hydraulically <b>bound</b> <b>gravel</b> base served as a further comparison to these two sections. In light of the deflection measurement results {{on the surface of the}} hydraulically bound base, the hydraulically bound sand sub-base sections show slightly less favourable characteristics. Whether or not this has any effect on long-term behaviour remains to be seen. With a view to the course bonding between the hydraulically bound base and the asphalt road base, a bond could in no way be determined from the material taken from the drilling core. With the help of surveys carried out by the 'Bundesanstalt fuer Strassenwesen' (Federal Highway research Institute) over a longer period of time, during which the deflections as well as the transverse and longitudinal profiles will be measured, the continued behaviour of the test stretch under traffic conditions is to be evaluated.

40|$|Port Hills Gravel Formation (PHG) is a Pliocene {{terrestrial}} soil-like deposit. It {{is located}} in Nelson {{as part of the}} Marsden and Port Hills Synclines. PHG is comprised of heterogeneous clay and silt <b>bound</b> <b>gravel,</b> with lenses of sandstone and occasional lignite seams and is intersected by northeast - southwest trending faults.. PHG soils are considered good building material for the construction of earth structures such as embankment dams, gully fills and slope buttresses but {{there have been a number}} of failures in poorly constructed fills [...] The purpose of this thesis was to study the engineering properties of PHG soils, to review current fill operations and to identify any serious shortcomings affecting earthfill operations with PHG soils and to establish standard testing methodologies and compaction criteria for the PHG soils...|$|E

Only tens of pieces were found in the Lusatian area (near Dresden), Cheb basin area (West Bohemia) and Northern Austria (near Radessen). Principal occurrences of moldavites in Bohemia are associated with Tertiary sediments of the České Budějovice and Třeboň Basins. The most prominent localities are concentrated in a NW-SE strip along the western margin of the České Budějovice Basin.

60|$|The {{theory of}} {{ordinary}} fountains is simple enough, and affords help in discovering them. In a few words, {{it is as}} follows:--All the water that runs from them has originally Been supplied by rain, dew, or fog-damp, falling {{on the face of}} the land and sinking into it. But the subsoil and rocks below, are far from being of a uniform character: they are full of layers of every imaginable degree of sponginess. Strata of clay wholly impenetrable by water, often divide beds of gravel that imbibe it freely. There are also cracks that make continuous channels and dislocations that cause them to end abruptly; and there are rents, filled with various materials, that may either give a free passage or entirely bar the underground course of water. Hence, when water has sunk into the earth, it does not by any means soak through it in an equable degree. It is an easier matter for it to ooze many miles, along a layer of gravel, than to penetrate six inches into a layer of clay that may <b>bound</b> the <b>gravel.</b> Therefore, whenever a porous earth or a fissured rock crops out to the light of day, there is, in ignorance of all other facts, some chance of a spring being discovered in the lowest part of the outcrop. A favourable condition for the existence of a large and permanent fountain, is where a porous stratum spreads over a broad area at a high level, and is prolonged, by a gradually narrowing course, to an outlet at a lower one. The broad upper part of the stratum catches plenty of water during the wet season, which sinks into the depths as into a reservoir, and oozes out in a regular stream at its lower outlet. A fissured rock makes a still easier channel for the water.|$|R
50|$|The Force India of Paul di Resta was {{the first}} car out on track {{for the first part}} of the {{qualifying}} session, initially using the harder compound prime tyres. The Sauber team also adopted that tactic, and their driver, Sergio Pérez, ran wide at the end of the Esses and <b>bounded</b> across the <b>gravel</b> before wrestling the car back to track. Later in the session, after Sebastian Vettel provisionally set the fastest time on prime tyres as well, Bruno Senna, in his Williams, was impeded by the Toro Rosso of Jean-Éric Vergne. On the approach to the final chicane Senna, on a flying lap, was held up by the slow-moving Vergne and gesticulated wildly out of his cockpit, forsaking his next flying lap in frustration. Vergne was issued with a three-place grid penalty for the race after he made the cut for the second part in qualifying in seventeenth. Vergne said that he had to slow down because he was catching Timo Glock before his flying lap. Michael Schumacher left his flying laps until the dying moments of the session, and after making a mistake at the second Degner curve, he found himself in last place with one last lap to make it into Q2; he was slower than Senna in the first two sectors of the circuit before crossing the line with the sixteenth fastest time, pushing Senna out. The Lotus of Romain Grosjean set the session's fastest time on the softer compound tyres, followed by the two Saubers and his teammate Kimi Räikkönen, who also needed to use those tyres.|$|R
40|$|The {{settlement}} of Gorgo del Ciliegio (Sansepolcro-Arezzo) is situated on an ancient terrace {{on the left}} bank of the Afra Creek, at about 400 metres above sea level, near-by the tuscan-emilian Appennines divide. During the six last years (2001 - 2006) an area of approximately 178 square meters was investigated, resulting in the fi ndings of a living fl oor with several structures (pole holes, combustion structures, pits of different typology), including a small food oven of particular interest. The pottery retrieved from the deposit is represented by cylindrical, troncoconic and globular vessels, among which milk boilers are present, carinated shapes (bowls, cups) and some sherds decorated in the Appennine styles, which has allowed for the attribution of the site to an early phase of the Middle Bronze 3 (BM 3). The Middle Bronze Age people settled on a preserved portion of an alluvial surface (T 1 a) standing about 10 meters higher than the coeval active channel of the Afra Creek, whose deposits are bounded by the surface T 2. This location ensured a relative protection from fl oods being, at the same time, close to a large water source. Sedimentological features of the alluvial <b>gravels</b> <b>bounded</b> on top by T 1 a and T 2 surfaces, suggest a significantly different fl uvial style during the late Holocene compared to the modern Afra Creek. Before (e. g. T 1 a deposits) and during (e. g. T 2 deposits) the human occupation at this site, the Afra Creek was characterized by a relatively wide (about 150 meters) valley with multiple shallow channels inside, fi lled by gravels. This style {{can be observed in}} some modern creeks of the Upper Tiber River basin, indicating local condition of channel overfilling. On the whole this ancient style contrasts with the modern one in which a few tens meter wide Afra Creek is deeply entrenched in the bedrock and still affected by erosive processes. Despite the different valley morphology attained during the late Holocene, the terracing of the Afra Creek recorded at the site, attests to successive readjustment of the river profile to repeated perturbation of base level possibly due to the active tectonic setting of the Upper Tiber River valley. The preliminary results of the archeozoological study demonstrate that the inhabitants of Gorgo del Ciliegio were involved in the rearing of mostly sheep-goats and pigs and cattle in the second place, and in the hunting of deer and roe-deer; domestic dogs were present on the site. Such a pattern and the geographic location of the site, might suggest that Gorgo del Ciliegio community mostly practised mobile pastoralism and the dogs may have been kept to assist with herding the animals. Preliminary pollen analysis of the archaeological soil, reveals a scarcity and a bad preservation of the pollen grains possibly due to a highly acidic environment. Nevertheless, few grains of Urticaceae point to local anthropic impact on the vegetation cover, fully consistent with the settlement activity...|$|R
40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the {{adjacent}} Tenthill and Ma Ma catchments which converge onto the heavily cultivated alluvial plain of Lockyer Creek. Groundwater extracted from the alluvial aquifers is {{the primary source of}} water for intensive irrigation. Within the study the hydrogeology is investigated, a conceptual groundwater model produced and a numerical groundwater flow model is developed from this. The hydrochemistry and stable isotope character of groundwater are also investigated to determine processes such as recharge and evaporation. Examination of bore logs confirms the Quaternary alluvium comprises a laterally continuous gravel aquifer with an average thickness of 4. 5 m, overlain by mixed sands and clays which form a semi-confining layer with an average thickness of 22 m. Variations in long term groundwater hydrographs indicate the aquifer changes from confined to unconfined in some locations as water levels drop, while bores adjacent to creek banks display a rapid response to a flood event. Pump testing of bores screened in the gravel produces estimates of hydraulic conductivity ranging from 50 - 80 m/day and storativity of 0. 00166 which are both within realistic bounds for this aquifer material. Major ion chemistry of surface water collected during a flood is Mgdominated, similar to alluvial groundwater in the Tenthill catchment and the Lockyer plain, suggesting a strong connection between surface and groundwater in these locations. Alluvial groundwater salinity in Tenthill catchment is typically less than 3500 ìS/cm but may approach 6000 ìS/cm on the Lockyer plain. By contrast Ma Ma catchment alluvial groundwater is Na-dominated with conductivity up to 12000 ìS/cm and more associated with groundwater from the underlying sandstone bedrock. Stable isotope analyses of alluvial groundwater from throughout both catchments and the Lockyer plain are compared with basalt and sandstone groundwater. A range of processes have been identified including recharge to alluvium from basalt groundwater and evaporated surface water; and alluvial-bedrock groundwater mixing at some locations. Integration of the components of the study enabled the production of a conceptual hydrogeological model of the Lockyer alluvial plain, proposing two hydrostratigraphic units; the gravel aquifer and the overlying mixed sand and clay which acts as a semi confining unit. Hydrochemical and stable isotopic evidence suggests seepage from creek channels as the dominant recharge process. A single layer groundwater flow model using MODFLOW was developed, based on groundwater extraction data, to represent flow in the gravel aquifer. The model was calibrated to transient conditions with groundwater fluctuations, incorporating both drought and flood conditions. A sensitivity analysis for each of the aquifer properties demonstrates the model is insensitive to variations within realistic <b>bounds</b> for the <b>gravel</b> aquifer material, however, the model is highly sensitive to changes in the chosen boundary conditions. Predictive simulations with several annual extraction scenarios ranging from 1. 75 to 0. 5 ML/ha indicate the resulting minimum saturated aquifer thickness ranges from 0. 03 to 1. 4 m...|$|R
