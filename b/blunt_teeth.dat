500|$|Crocodilians {{are largely}} carnivorous, and the diets of {{different}} species can vary with snout shape and tooth sharpness. Species with sharp teeth and long slender snouts, like the Indian gharial and Australian freshwater crocodile, are specialised for feeding on fish, insects, and crustaceans, while extremely broad-snouted species with <b>blunt</b> <b>teeth,</b> like the Chinese alligator and broad-snouted caiman, specialise in eating hard-shelled molluscs. Species whose snouts and teeth are intermediate {{between these two}} forms, such as the saltwater crocodile and American alligator, have generalised diets and opportunistically feed on invertebrates, fish, [...] amphibians, other reptiles, birds, and mammals. Though mostly carnivorous, several species of crocodilian have been observed to consume fruit, and this {{may play a role}} in seed dispersal.|$|E
500|$|Banksia sceptrum {{generally}} grows as a shrub up to [...] high, {{though sometimes}} it reaches [...] It is many-branched and can reach [...] in diameter. The stocky trunk has smooth or mildly tessellated pale grey bark. New {{growth has been}} recorded in spring and autumn, and may possibly occur over the summer. New branchlets are covered in fine greenish-brown fur and become smooth and pale grey after around two years. The leaves are roughly oblong-shaped with truncate or emarginate ends and measure [...] long and [...] wide. They are on [...] long petioles. The flat leaf margins have short <b>blunt</b> <b>teeth.</b> The upper and lower surfaces of the leaf are covered in dense fur, but become smooth with age.|$|E

2500|$|The razorbelly scad {{is similar}} in body shape and profile {{to the rest of}} Alepes, {{possessing}} a strongly compressed ovate body. The dorsal profile of the body is definitively less [...] than the ventral profile, giving the upper and lower parts of the body an asymmetry which is further heightened by the different sized lobes of the caudal fin. The head of the fish tapers to a pointed snout, with the large eye having a well-developed posterior adipose eyelid. The teeth of the fish are a major diagnostic feature of the species, with the upper jaw having two irregular rows of small conical teeth {{at the front of the}} mouth, transitioning to a paving of <b>blunt</b> <b>teeth</b> at the back. The lower jaw is similar, having two rows of short conical teeth in the front of the jaw changing to one row of blunter teeth further back. There are two separate dorsal fins, the first containing eight weak spines while the second consists of a single spine followed by 23 to 26 soft rays. The anal fin has two detached spines anterior to the main section, which consists of a single spine followed by 19 to 22 soft rays. The upper caudal fin lobe is larger than the lower lobe, whilst the pelvic fin is quite small in comparison to those of other carangids. The lateral line is strongly arched anteriorally, with the arched and straight sections of the line intersecting below the fourth to sixth soft dorsal rays. The curved section of the line contains [...] 32 to 46 scales and up to 2 scutes, while the straight section consists of 35 to 45 scutes and up to 2 scales. The species has 24 vertebrae and a total of 38 to 44 gill rakers. It is a fairly small fish compared to most carangids, only known to reach 16cm in length.|$|E
60|$|Mouth.--Labrum highly bullate; crest {{with not}} very minute, <b>blunt</b> <b>teeth,</b> which towards the middle lie {{closer and closer}} to each other, so as to touch. Palpi rather small, with a few very long {{bristles}} at the apex.|$|E
60|$|Mouth.--Labrum {{considerably}} bullate, equalling {{about half}} the longitudinal diameter of the mouth; inferior part produced so as to separate the mouth some way from the adductor muscle; crest with a row of <b>blunt</b> <b>teeth</b> and hairs; central part depressed and flattened.|$|E
50|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 4 mm and 8 mm. The sculpture, {{compared}} to Dentistyla asperrima, is more strongly and exclusively nodulous.

6000|$|... 'Right! All right!' said Dan. Old Jim wheeled round, {{took his}} bone {{carefully}} between his <b>blunted</b> <b>teeth,</b> {{and returned to}} the shadow of the old barn, looking just like a wolf. The children went on. Two kestrels hung bivvering and squealing above them. A gull flapped lazily along the white edge of the cliffs. The curves of the Downs shook a little in the heat, and so did Mr Dudeney's distant head.|$|R
60|$|Labrum, placed {{near the}} {{adductor}} muscle, with {{the upper part}} not more bullate than the lower part; crest with a row of <b>blunt</b> <b>teeth,</b> and many fine bristles growing chiefly outside the teeth; there are many fine bristles on the inner or supra-oesophageal fold of the labrum.|$|E
60|$|Mouth.--Labrum highly bullate, {{but with}} the {{uppermost}} part not more bullate than the lower part, and therefore not overhanging it; basal margin much produced; crest with some small <b>blunt</b> <b>teeth</b> and some bristles. The inner fold of the labrum is much thickened, yellow, punctured, and with a tuft of fine bristles on each side.|$|E
60|$|Whether he hit {{or not is}} uncertain, {{but next}} moment the enraged animal rose again under Disco's canoe, which it nearly lifted {{out of the water}} in its efforts to seize it in its mouth. Fortunately the canoe was too flat for its jaws to grip; the monster's <b>blunt</b> <b>teeth</b> were felt, as well as heard, to grind across the planks; and Disco being in the stern, which was raised highest, was almost thrown {{overboard}} by the jerk.|$|E
60|$|The Labrum is {{moderately}} bullate, with {{a row of}} <b>blunt</b> bead-like <b>teeth,</b> {{mingled with}} fine bristles, on the crest, which in the middle part is generally somewhat flattened.|$|R

5000|$|Peloneustes (meaning 'mud swimmer') is an extinct genus of sauropterygian reptile {{belonging}} to the family Pliosauridae. It is known from the Callovian aged (Middle Jurassic) deposits of the Oxford clay formation of England. With a length of around 3 m, {{it was one of}} the smallest representatives of the group. [...] Like its larger relatives, Peloneustes had a short neck and long jaws capable of grabbing large prey. Its streamlined body allowed it to chase fast prey such as belemnites. As it had fewer and <b>blunter</b> <b>teeth</b> than its relatives, it is thought to have mainly fed on hard prey such as ammonites.|$|R
6000|$|So warm was the evening, {{that the}} window {{remained}} open, until Ponto erected his crest as a footfall came steadily along, nearer and nearer. Uplifting {{one of his}} pendant lips, he gave a low growl through his <b>blunted</b> <b>teeth,</b> and listened again; but apparently satisfied that the step was familiar, he replaced his head on his crossed paws, and presently Robert Fulmort's head and {{the upper part of}} his person, in correct evening costume, were thrust in at the window, the moonlight making his face look very white, as he said, 'Come, Phoebe, make haste; it is very late.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Two species also placed within Machimosaurus are M. bathonicus and M. rigauxi, {{from the}} Bathonian of France. However, these are gracile species, lacking the {{characteristic}} <b>blunted</b> <b>teeth</b> of Machimosaurus, and are probably referable to Steneosaurus. Mark Young {{and his colleagues}} [...] made a detailed revision of the genus and recognized four species: M. hugii, M. mosae, M. nowackianus from Harrar, Ethiopia, and a new species, Machimosaurus buffetauti. They hypothesized that Machimosaurus may have been analogous to the Pliocene-Holocene genus Crocodylus in having one large-bodied taxon suited to traversing marine barriers and additional, geographically limited taxa across its range.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves are}} compound, with a 2-4 cm petiole with three leaflets, each 3-10 cm long and 2-6 cm broad, dark green above, bright {{glaucous}} blue-green beneath, with several <b>blunt</b> <b>teeth</b> on the margins.|$|E
50|$|Pantylus was {{probably}} a largely terrestrial animal, judging from its well-built legs. It was about 25 cm long, and resembled a lizard with a large skull and short limbs. It had numerous <b>blunt</b> <b>teeth,</b> and probably chased after invertebrate prey.|$|E
5000|$|Family Tseajaiidae {{known from}} a single {{specimen}} from North America, were medium-sized, generalized reptiliomorph amphibians.

40|$|Megadesmus Sowerby 1838 and Astartila Dana 1847 are {{bivalves}} {{from the}} Australian Permian, which {{belong to a}} group that Newell has termed “primitive desmodonts”. Both genera have a single <b>blunt</b> <b>tooth</b> in the right valve and a corresponding socket in the left. The tooth and socket are derived from folds in the valve margin and {{are not related to}} the teeth of heterodonts. Differences in shape, size, and pedal musculature separate Astartila from Megadesmus. Cleobis Dana 1847 differs only in having slightly different dentition and a small siphonal gape and is retained as a subgenus of Megadesmus. Astartila (Pleurikodonta) n. subgen. has been proposed for a small Astartila‐like species with well‐developed radial ornament...|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the shell size varies between 15 mm and 45 mm. The shell is heavy and coarse with rough, grained surface with {{moderate}} sutures between rounded whorls. The body whorl is swollen and the penultimate whorl somewhat less. The shell shows a rounded keel (a spiral ridge marking a change of slope) and an umbilicus sealed with a callus. The apex is often worn away in adults. The columella has a prominent, <b>blunt</b> <b>tooth.</b> The inner edge of the outer lip shows a number of smaller knobs. The aperture has a nacreous interior.The color of the shell varies from a dark reddish brown to pale brown, with spiraled dashes of cream or pink.|$|R

5000|$|Acer opalus is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree growing to 20 m tall, with a trunk up to 1 m diameter. The leaves are glossy green, 7 - 13 cm long and 5 - 16 cm across, palmately lobed with <b>blunt</b> <b>teeth.</b> They turn yellow in autumn.|$|E
50|$|The suckers of {{the arms}} possess <b>blunt</b> <b>teeth.</b> On the meaty ends (clubs) of the tentacles, there are four rows of suckers; the inner two (mesial) rows are three times {{as large as the}} outer two (marginal) rows. The larger suckers have horny rings with up to 45 teeth.|$|E
50|$|Tegus in the Salvator genus are {{omnivorous}} {{as adults}} but primarily carnivorous as juveniles. As adults, they have <b>blunted</b> <b>teeth</b> and exaggerated lateral pterygoidal muscles which {{allow them to}} be generalist feeders. In captivity, they have been observed eating various feeder insects like mealworms, superworms, earthworms, silkworms, crickets and roaches, as well as vertebrate prey like mice, rats, fish, turkey (offered in a ground form), rabbit, quail, and chicks. Crustaceans such as crayfish are also readily consumed. Like all lizards, blue tegus need a properly balanced diet; incomplete prey items such as insects or ground meat require dusting with a mineral/multi-vitamin supplement. Vitamin deficiencies can lead to trouble shedding skin, lethargy and weight loss; a calcium deficiency can lead to metabolic bone disease, which can be fatal.|$|R
50|$|The sucker-shoot leaves range up to 130 mm in length. The short, thick petiole is {{bracketed}} by uneven lobes of {{the leaf}} base, with one lobe typically being distinctly larger than the other. The leaves have a pinnate vein structure, with the primary vein having between twelve and fourteen secondary veins branching from it at decreasingly sharp angles from apex to base {{of the leaf}}. The secondary veins and the exterior branches off the secondaries terminate in teeth along the leaf margins. The leaves have compound teeth, each of the large teeth on having a smaller tooth located basally {{between it and the}} next large tooth. All the teeth typically have convex sides that terminate at <b>blunt</b> <b>tooth</b> tips, though occasional teeth have straight or concave sides.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the shell {{measures}} 1.7 mm. The minute, white shell is solid, short, truncated and boldly ribbed. It contains three rounded whorls plus a smooth, inverted tip. The suture is deeply impressed, or channeled. About 20 strong rounded axial ribs cross the whorls, and bend over into the suture, and disappear on the base. They are separated by deep furrows of about equal width, which are crossed by numerous slightly raised lirae, which do not pass over the ribs, but continue on the base. The aperture is ovately pyriform, slightly expanded in front. The columella is curved, a little reflected over a narrow umbilicus, and bearing medially a very small, <b>blunt</b> <b>tooth,</b> which is quite invisible from a front view.|$|R
