5|$|I hemmed and hawed {{about it}} for a while because just for that reason though. Everybody wants to do the theme song of a James Bond movie, and I never liked to do what {{everybody}} else likes to do. It's just some perverse thing in me, right? So, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> thought about it and I said, you know what? James Bond needs to get – needs to get techno so...|$|E
5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> confess, {{you have}} one reason that I am unable to confute, — which is the {{contrary}} judgment of your neighbour ministers. They may see more than I can, (especially such as judicious and honest Mr. Fisher, who knoweth both places.) And, therefore, I presume not peremptorily to advise you, but to cast in my thoughts; which, if they seem unsatisfactory to you, reject them.|$|E

25|$|Based on {{something}} a (now ex) girlfriend said to me. I {{thought it was}} a negative picture, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> realised it was positive because it’s a reconciliation after self-knowledge. It’s also ambiguous as to who’s speaking. Most of my paintings are based on experiences with people I know, usually on a drawing from life, but in this case from a photo I took of her.|$|E
25|$|I had to gain {{them some}} time, and I {{could think of}} nothing other than to attack. I had to stop them somehow. I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't going to make it back.|$|E
500|$|The sprawling, {{progressive}} midsection was not {{featured in}} the song's original edit, but is based around a riff that Rudess came up with in the control room, when listening to the original, more conservative instrumental section.

500|$|Armstrong has {{discussed}} the group's status {{of being a}} punk band on a major record label, saying [...] "Sometimes I think we've become totally redundant because we're this big band now; we've {{made a lot of}} money – we're not punk rock any more. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'" ...|$|E

500|$|PopMatters {{reviewer}} Brendan Maher accused Insane Clown Posse of misogyny {{and described}} The Amazing Jeckel Brothers as [...] "music to strangle your ex-girlfriend to". Robert Christgau gave the album a C+, writing [...] "Though they claim clown, they rarely get funnier than 'I'd cut my head off <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> would be dead'." [...] However, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album a {{four out of}} five star rating, writing that [...] " [...] actually delivered an album that comes close to fulfilling whatever promise their ridiculous, carnivalesque blend of hardcore hip hop and shock-metal had in the first place".|$|E

500|$|When {{asked if}} he {{considers}} [...] "Jai Ho" [...] as his best creation, Rahman stated: [...] "Sometimes it's not about a best creation, but the best for a particular moment of the film. 'Jai Ho' was right for that particular moment, that particular mindset in Slumdog Millionaire. I know there's lot of debate over this song winning the Oscars. <b>But</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> didn't send the song to the Oscars, the makers did. I just composed the tune in three weeks and was done with it. However, I too feel 'Jai Ho' was apt for that particular moment in the film—the protagonist comes out of darkness and pain to light amid 'Jai Ho' hammering in the background." ...|$|E
