40|$|We outline {{a quantum}} {{convolutional}} coding technique for protecting {{a stream of}} classical bits and qubits. Our goal {{is to provide a}} framework for designing codes that approach the ``grandfather'' capacity of an entanglement-assisted quantum channel for sending classical and quantum information simultaneously. Our method incorporates several resources for quantum redundancy: fresh ancilla qubits, entangled <b>bits,</b> and <b>gauge</b> qubits. The use of these diverse resources gives our technique the benefits of both active and passive quantum error correction. We can encode a classical-quantum bit stream with periodic quantum gates because our codes possess a convolutional structure. We end with an example of a ``grandfather'' quantum convolutional code that protects one qubit and one classical bit per frame by encoding them with one fresh ancilla qubit, one entangled <b>bit,</b> and one <b>gauge</b> qubit per frame. We explicitly provide the encoding and decoding circuits for this example.

40|$|An {{unexpected}} {{breakdown in}} the existing theory of quantum serial turbo coding is that a quantum convolutional encoder cannot simultaneously be recursive and non-catastrophic. These properties are essential for quantum turbo code families to have a minimum distance growing with blocklength and for their iterative decoding algorithm to converge, respectively. Here, we show that the entanglement-assisted paradigm simplifies the theory of quantum turbo codes, {{in the sense that}} an entanglement-assisted quantum (EAQ) convolutional encoder can possess both of the aforementioned desirable properties. We give several examples of EAQ convolutional encoders that are both recursive and non-catastrophic and detail their relevant parameters. We then modify the quantum turbo decoding algorithm of Poulin et al., in order to have the constituent decoders pass along only "extrinsic information" to each other rather than a posteriori probabilities as in the decoder of Poulin et al., and this leads to a significant improvement in the performance of unassisted quantum turbo codes. Other simulation results indicate that entanglement-assisted turbo codes can operate reliably in a noise regime 4. 73 dB beyond that of standard quantum turbo codes, when used on a memoryless depolarizing channel. Furthermore, several of our quantum turbo codes are within 1 dB or less of their hashing limits, so that the performance of quantum turbo codes is now on par with that of classical turbo codes. Finally, we prove that entanglement is the resource that enables a convolutional encoder to be both non-catastrophic and recursive because an encoder acting on only information qubits, classical <b>bits,</b> <b>gauge</b> qubits, and ancilla qubits cannot simultaneously satisfy them.

40|$|We {{consider}} a system {{consisting of a}} 2 D network of links between Majorana fermions on superconducting islands. We show that the fermionic Hamiltonian modeling this system is topologically-ordered in a region of parameter space. In particular we show that Kitaev's toric code emerges in fourth-order perturbation theory. By using a Jordan-Wigner transformation we can map the model onto a family of signed 2 D Ising models in a transverse field where the signs (FM or AFM) are determined by additional <b>gauge</b> <b>bits.</b> Our mapping allows {{an understanding of the}} non-perturbative regime and the phase transition to a non-topological phase. We discuss the physics behind a possible implementation of this model and argue how it can be used for topological quantum computation by adiabatic changes in the Hamiltonian.
