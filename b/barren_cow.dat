That cow which you have taken was of no worth to me, for who wishes to keep a beast that is ever tearing and lowing {{at the gates of}} the kraal, {{disturbing}} those who would sleep inside with her noise? Had you asked her of me, I would have given her to you freely. I thank you for your offer, but I need no more cows, especially if, like this one, they have no calves. As for a wall between us, there is none, for how can two men who, if the battle is to be won, must stand shoulder to shoulder, fight if divided by a wall? O Son of the King, I am dreaming by day and night of the battle and the victory, and I have forgotten all about the <b>barren</b> <b>cow</b> that ran away after you, the great bull of the herd. Only do not be surprised if one day you find that this cow has a sharp horn." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{appeal was}} heard in 1887 by the Supreme Court of Michigan in which Walker {{asserted}} {{in his defense}} that he claimed that both parties had been mistaken as {{to the nature of}} the cow regarding whether it was barren or fertile and able to bear calves and that therefore there was no contract and further testified at trial that he had mistakenly agreed to sell the cow at the price of a <b>barren</b> <b>cow</b> which in this case was $80 but because the cow was in fact with calf, however, the cow was actually worth between $750 and $1000. The issue was, (under Michigan contract law) whether or not the defendant (Walker) could refuse to sell the cow because the parties did not know that the cow was actually fertile at the time they struck their bargain.|$|E
5000|$|The reconstructed {{argument}} {{of the text}} is as follows:Appu is a rich man, but he is unhappy because he has no son. The text hints at the possibility that Appu doesn't know anything about sex. He sacrifices a lamb to ask {{the help of the}} gods. The sun-god appears and advises him to get drunk and then have sex with his wife. Eventually, Appu's wife gives birth to a first son, named [...] (...) [...] "bad, evil". At this point the text alludes to a rite of name-giving, paralleled in the Song of Ullikummi, where the newborn is set on the knee of the father.Appu's wife later gives birth to a second son, named [...] (...) [...] "good, righteous". When both sons have reached adult age, Idalu suggests that they divide the paternal estate among them.He argues that, as each of the gods has his own city, so should they also each have their own property. Idalu tricks his brother, taking most of the estate and leaving him only with a <b>barren</b> <b>cow.</b> But the sun-god blesses the cow and restores her fertility. At this point the first tablet ends {{and the rest of the}} story is very fragmentary.|$|E
50|$|The Apastamba Dharmasutra asserts {{in verse}} 1.20.10 that trade is {{generally}} not sanctioned for Brahmins, but in the times of adversity he may do so. The chapter 1.20 of Apastamba, states Olivelle, forbids the trade of the following under any circumstances: human beings, meat, skins, weapons, <b>barren</b> <b>cows,</b> sesame seeds, pepper, and merits.|$|R

Also {{it may be that}} she drew {{something}} from Hans, and from Goroko and the other Zulus with you, and thus paid us the fee that she had promised for our service, but in lung-sick oxen and <b>barren</b> <b>cows,</b> not in good cattle, Umslopogaas." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reaching to Deoth Sidh and Cave Dwelling :After getting {{defeat in}} every feat, Gorakh Nath {{directed}} his disciples to forcibly put rings in {{the ears of}} BabaJi. Every disciple became faint before doing so, During that struggle BabaJi made a loud cry and reached a place where [...] "Charan Paduka" [...] temple is situated. From [...] "Charan Paduka", BabaJi went to a cave on the hill. A demon {{came out of the}} Cave and warned BabaJi to go away. Babaji, by his [...] "sidh-shakti" [...] forced the demon to vacate the cave for BabaJi's meditation.The demon understood the state of affairs and went away. Then BabaJi settled there for meditation. Bhartrihari also settled for meditation near that cave. One day, a Brahmin named as [...] "Banarasi" [...] from the nearby village Chakmoh came to that area for grazing his cows. BabaJi appeared before him and interacted. Brahmin told Babaji about his <b>barren</b> <b>cows.</b> Babaji asked where his cows were. Surprisingly only lions and tigers were there. After seeing the stunning posture of Brahmin, Babaji asked him to call his cows. Astonishingly, as the Brahmin called, his cows surrounded him. Seeing the miracle, Brahmin became the devotee of Babaji. Brahmin continued to see Babaji. One day Babaji told him that he would disappear one day and asked the Brahmin to continue the tradition of [...] "Dhuna" [...] and worshipping. Brahmin followed the point and maintained the tradition. A lamp remained lighted near Babaji whose light spread away in the nearby villages. Thus people had started calling Babaji as [...] "Baba Deoth Sidh" [...] and later on the place became famous as [...] "Baba Deoth Sidh".|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "counter proverb" [...] {{is more about}} pairs of {{contradictory}} proverbs than {{about the use of}} proverbs to counter each other in an argument. For example, from the Tafi language of Ghana, the following pair of proverbs are counter to each other but are each used in appropriate contexts, [...] "A co-wife who is too powerful for you, you address her as your mother" [...] and [...] "Do not call your mother's co-wife your mother..." [...] In Nepali, there is a set of totally contradictory proverbs: [...] "Religion is victorious and sin erodes" [...] and [...] "Religion erodes and sin is victorious".Also, the following pair are counter proverbs from the Kasena of Ghana: [...] "It is the patient person who will milk a barren cow" [...] and [...] "The person who would milk a <b>barren</b> <b>cow</b> must prepare for a kick on the forehead". The two contradict each other, whether they are used in an argument or not (though indeed they were used in an argument). But the same work contains an appendix with many examples of proverbs used in arguing for contrary positions, but proverbs that are not inherently contradictory, such as [...] "One is better off with hope of a cow's return than news of its death" [...] countered by [...] "If you don't know a goat its death you mock at its skin". Though this pair was used in a contradictory way in a conversation, they are not a set of [...] "counter proverbs".|$|E
5000|$|Guru Gorakshanath wanted Babaji to {{join his}} sect and tried his best to do so. Babaji was not willing for that. One day Guru Gorakh Nath along with his 300 disciples and asked Babaji to provide them seating. Babaji spread his towel and {{surprisingly}} a portion of that remained unoccupied even after accommodating Guru Gorakh Nath along with his all disciples. Then Gorakh Nath asked Babaji to bring some water in a bowl from a nearby hill-bauli.Babaji found some magic in the bowl when he filled it with water. Thus he understood the intention of Guru Gorakh Nath. Babaji made that bauli disappear by his Sidhi and told Gorakh Nath about the non-existence of the bauli. Gorakh Nath asked his disciple Bhartrihari to accompany Babaji to verify the fact. Bhartrihari was {{taken aback by the}} non-existence of the bauli. Babaji told Bhartrihari the factual position and further emphasized the imprudence of Gorakh Nath for shunning the workship of [...] "Lord Shiva" [...] and in its place recommending his own adoration.Bhartrihari understood the whole game and offered his devotion to Lord Shiva. This time also, BabaJi returned without water. Then Gorakh Nath sent Bhaironath to bring Bhartrihari back along with water. Bhairon Nath too couldn't spot the water and returned empty handed without water and Bhartrihari. Thereafter Gorakh Nath asked Babaji to serve them milk. Babaji called a non-milking <b>barren</b> <b>cow</b> and patted her. The cow started milking and everybody took milk. Amazingly there was still lot of milk in the bowl. Gorakh Nath threw his worshipping skin to sky and asked Babaji to bring back to the earth. Babaji aimed the skin with his [...] "Chimata" [...] and pieces of skin fell on earth. At this, Babaji tempted Gorakh Nath to bring Babaji's [...] "Chimata" [...] back to the earth. Gorakh Nath asked Bhairon to do the same, which Bhairon couldn't.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{management}} of reproduction on 66 Scottish suckler herds calving in spring 2003 was analysed using multiple regression. The predicted mean value of suckled calves produced was £ 237 /cow (SE 1. 8). The regression coefficients of the predictors was 0. 74 (0. 05), 15 (3. 9) and 248 (16. 5) for date of first calving, average number of 21 -day calving periods (calving spread) and proportion of <b>cows</b> <b>barren</b> respectively. Improving each predictor by 1 SD had the combined potential to improve predicted calf value by £ 64 /cow, over 80 % of the current typical gross margin {{for this type of}} enterprise. Bull care had a significant influence on calving spread and number of biosecurity measures taken had a positive influence on the proportion of <b>cows</b> <b>barren.</b> However, length of breeding season had no significant impact on the above predictors. Reproductive performance was highly variable and indicators were considerably poorer than published targets. It was concluded that farmers in this sample were not managing their herds for high reproductive performance and output as often advocated. This result suggests considerable scope for improved private and public benefits from the management of reproduction in this type of beef production system.

40|$|Ethiopia has {{the largest}} {{livestock}} population in Africa with approximately 30 million cattle, of which 9 to 10 million oxen are used for draft purposes. About 85 percent of the estimated 55 million human population lives in rural areas, with agriculture as the primary occupation. About 90 percent of these rural communities use draft animals for various purposes. Among farmers who use draft animal power, about 29 percent have a pair, 8 percent three or more, 34 percent have one and 29 percent have no oxen. Access to draft power at specific {{time of the year}} can therefore be a key factor influencing the crop agriculture. The Ethiopian highlands represent 40 percent of the total land mass of 1, 098, 000 km 2 and is inhabited by about 90 percent of the human population. The main purpose of keeping cattle in the highlands is for draft power, and it is estimated to account for about 60 percent of the cattle product by value. In crop production, draft oxen are estimated to contribute to more than 26 percent of the total labour requirements. About 66 percent of the country's 14 million crop land is cultivated with the use of animal power. The average land size in the highlands is about 2. 5 hectares and land preparation and subsequent cultivation is done primarily with a pair of oxen drawing the maresha. It is estimated that herds of 8 to 10 cattle have to be kept by individual farmers at any one time to ensure availability of a pair of working oxen during land cultivation. The major feed resources that support livestock in the highlands include about 23 million hectares of grazing land and crop residues. Zebu oxen are the main animals used for tillage and threshing. In some areas where oxen are in short supply, horses, mules and donkeys are either hitched with the same species or in mixed pairs. Sometimes oxen are paired with equine or <b>barren</b> <b>cows</b> for ploughing. Oxen work for about 2 months per year, although the work potential of draft cattle can be 8 to 10 months as is estimated in India. The non-use of oxen for transport and other task during the long non-cultivation period {{is one of the reasons}} for the low utilization of oxen in Ethiopia. In the last three decades to 1991, food production per head fell steadily, mainly as a result of civil war, soil exhaustion, erosion and over-population in the marginal highland agrarian areas. This created dependence on food imports ranging from 100, 000 tons in 1980 to 1 million tons in 1995 / 96 as a result of favourable weather and intervention. However, the growing scale of the structural food deficit indicates that the country needs to produce an extra 320, 000 tons of food per year simply to keep pace with population growth. Almost all the food production is dependent on mainly draft oxen which plough a total land area of about 7 million ha, generating a total power output of 250, 566, 840 kwh per year. The draft power generated for ploughing per year would be equivalent to about 27 percent of the total amount of electricity sold in the country. Availability of oxen and their work efficiency could have substantial impact of food production. In this paper, the use and requirements are examined and possible areas that need improvement are suggested and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Four <b>barren</b> Holstein <b>cows</b> {{fitted with}} ruminal fistulas were {{assigned}} to each of two dietary treatments in a replicated 2 x 2 Latin square design. Treatments consisted of a basal ration and a basal ration plus lOg/d of a viable yeast culture (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Cows were fed treatments for a 21 -day adaptation followed by a 7 -day collection period. Total ruminal bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa were unaffected by treatment. Feeding the viable yeast culture significantly increased ruminal acetic acid and acetic/propionic ratio. Molar percentage of propionic, isobutyric, isovaleric and valerie acids and rumen ammonia-N levels were significantly reduced in cattle fed added yeast culture. Liquid dilution and particulate rate of passage and total tract apparent nutrient digestibility were unaffected by treatment. Eighteen Holstein cows in mid-lactation were allocated equally {{to one of two}} treatments based on stage of lactation and previous mean daily 2 -week milk yield. Therefore, nine cows were allocated to each treatment. Treatments consisted of a basal ration and a basal ration plus 10 g/d of yeast culture (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Cows were fed total mixed rations for a 10 -week period. In week 8, feed and fecal samples were collected twice daily for 3 days. Acid detergent fiber insoluble ash was used to determine total tract apparent nutrient digestibility. Feeding mid-lactation dairy cows the viable yeast culture had no effect on mean daily dry matter intake. However, it tended to improve mean daily 3. 5 % FCM. Milk production efficiency was higher in lactating dairy cows supplemented with the viable yeast culture when compared to the nonsupplemented cows. Milk composition and overall mean body weights were unaffected by treatment. Total tract apparent nutrient digestibilities also were unaffected by treatment...|$|R
