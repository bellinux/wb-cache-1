40|$|To improve {{yarn quality}} in ring {{spinning}} frame, this paper examines transposal spinning with the movable <b>balloon</b> control <b>ring.</b> The left-transposal spinning and the right-transposal spinning were experimented to spin two yarns; after installing the movable <b>balloon</b> control <b>ring,</b> the two methods were respectively used to spin two other yarns again.

40|$|The ring {{spinning}} {{process has been}} used to produce fine and high quality staple fibre yarns. The stability of the rotating yarn loop (i. e. balloon) between the yarn-guide and the traveller-ring is crucial to the success and economics of this process. <b>Balloon</b> control <b>rings</b> are used to contain the yarn-loop, by reducing the yarn tension and decreasing the balloon flutter instability. Flutter instability here refers to the uncontrolled changes in a ballooning yarn under dynamic forces, including the air drag. Due to the significant variation in the length and radius of the balloon during the bobbin filling process, the optimal location for the <b>balloon</b> control <b>ring</b> is not easily determined. In order to address this difficulty, this study investigates the variation in the radius of a free balloon and examines the effect of <b>balloon</b> control <b>rings</b> of various diameters at different locations on yarn tension and balloon flutter stability. The results indicate that the maximum radius of a free balloon and its corresponding position depend not only on the yarn-length to balloon-height ratio, but also on yarn type and count. A control ring of suitable radius and position can significantly reduce yarn tension and decrease flutter instability of free single-loop balloons. While the <b>balloon</b> control <b>rings</b> are usually fixed to, and move in sinc with, the ring frame, results reported in this study suggest that theoretically, a <b>balloon</b> control <b>ring</b> that always remains approximately half way between the yarn-guide and the ring rail du{{ring spinning}} can lead to significant reduction in yarn tension. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Compared {{to other}} {{spinning}} system, the ring spinning {{process has been}} used to produce higher quality yarns, but with a much lower spinning efficiency, resulted from the relatively high spinning tension that leads to increased yarn breakage rates and makes high power consumption. Thus, depressing yarn tension is essential to change the status. In this paper, we design a movable balloon controller system to reduce yarn tension. The system is automatic, composed of powder switch, touch screen, PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), pulling-thread displacement sensor, controller of step motor, step motor and linear module. PLC, the core of the system, controls the position of the balloon controller by a series of programs. Then yarn tension was tested while spinning with movable <b>balloon</b> control <b>ring,</b> fixed <b>balloon</b> control <b>ring</b> and no <b>balloon</b> control <b>ring,</b> respectively. The result shows that the yarn tension can be depressed indeed by equipping this movable balloon controller system to some extent. Additionally, we find that the number of hairiness of ring spun yarns with this system can be reduced to some extent, while yarn tensile properties are not as sensitive to be worse. It is significant to cut down ends-down rate, improve the quality of ring spun yarns, the spinning efficiency as well as the energy efficiency of ring spinning...|$|R

40|$|A solar turbine {{power station}} (STPS) has three major {{components:}} A cyclical solar collector A solar chimney {{in the center}} of the solar collector A set of air turbo generators near the entrance of the solar chimney The power output of a STPS is roughly proportional to the height of the solar chimney and the surface area of its solar collector. In order to increase the power output and the efficiency of a STPS with a given solar collector, we must increase the height of its solar chimney. This can be achieved using floating solar chimneys. The floating solar chimney (FSC) invented by the author, is a lighter than air construction, made by successive <b>balloon</b> <b>rings,</b> that are filled with He or NH 3. This permits to the FSCs to float in the air and thus to have heights up to several Km with any appropriate internal diameter. In the present paper an extensive presentation of the power output and the efficiency of the STPSs with FSCs is given. As it is shown the power output and the efficiency of the STPS depend on the dimensions of the FSC and the solar collector on the loss coefficients of its FSC and on the environmental characteristics (solar irradiance, temperature and pressure). The efficiency of a STPS with a rated power output of 100 MW is between the ranges of 4. 5 % to 7 % if its FSC heights are in the range of 3000 m to 4500 m...|$|R

40|$|Melanoma {{comprises}} a {{wide range}} of cytological and architectural features histopathologically and hence can mimic many benign and malignant lesions of epithelial, mesenchymal and hematopoietic cell lines of differentiation. Therefore, analysis and close clinical, histological, histochemical and immunohistochemical correlation is vital in distinguishing challenging melanoma cases from their mimics. In this review, the different features of the benign, pre-malignant and malignant intraepidermal non-melanocytic tumours and tumour-like lesions that can closely mimic intraepidermal melanoma (melanoma in situ) are emphasised. Melanoma cells vary from epithelioid to spindle shape and may have diverse cytoplasmic morphol-ogies such as histiocytic-like, clear cell, <b>balloon</b> cell, signet <b>ring,</b> rhabdoid and small cell. They arrange in different architectural patterns including nests, whorls, rosettes, trabeculae, nodules, glands and papillary formation. 1 Thus, melanoma can be misdiagnosed and mistaken for many benign and malignant lesions. In addition, the absence or minimal presence of junctional component and small inadequate biopsy specimens can cause considerable confusion. 2 Therefore, histochemical stains such as PAS, PASD, and colloidal iron and immunohistochemical stains 3 – 6 are used extensively to differentiate melanoma from other tumour and tumour-like lesions, but this should be done in the context of close clinical and histological correlation (see fig 1). Ultrastructural examination may be used in rare circumstances to help to establish the diagnosis. In this review, we classify the intraepidermal non-melanocytic mimics according to their biolo-gical behaviour as benign, pre-malignant, uncertain and malignant (fig 2) ...|$|R

Methods: retrospective, descriptive study of 187 patients with pulmonary stenosis to whom a valvuloplasty with balloon was performed between 1995 and 2005. The procedure was classified as successful when the transvalvular pulmonary gradient diminished to 30 mm Hg, by echocardiography, after an effective procedure. Results: 192 valvuloplasties were performed in 187 patients, 51. 9 % male, mean age between 3. 1 ± 3. 8 years (between 1 day and 21 years) and mean weight 13. 18 ± 11. 14 kg (2. 5 to 55 Kg). 11. 7 % of the patients were newborns, 22. 5 % were critical stenosis and 27. 8 % were associated to congenital cardiopathy. 95. 2 % of valvuloplasties were successful with significant reduction of the transvalvular gradient from 63. 32 ± 28. 05 mm Hg to 9. 57 ± 10. 41 mm Hg (p= 0. 000) and from the right ventricular systolic pressure from 84. 09 ± 28. 91 mm Hg to 39. 89 ± 16. 98 mm Hg (p= 0. 000). It was found a relation between {{the presence of an}} associated cardiopathy and the need of a second valvuloplasty (p= 0. 000), as well as between the performance of surgery (p= 0. 000) and the presence of restenosis (p= 0. 000). There were complications in 17 patients, being the embolic phenomena the most frequent ones. Only a newborn with critical stenosis and cardiogenic shock previous to the procedure, died. Follow-up of 129 patients (68. 7 %) between 1 month and 9. 5 years (mean age 1. 73 ± 2. 41 years) was realized. Significant restenosis was presented in 24 (18. 6 %) patients, moderate in 13 and severe in 11. Restenosis was related to a lesser diameter in the pulmonary ring (p= 0. 006) and with valvular dysplasia (p= 0. 011). No significant relationship between restenosis and patient’s age in the first valvuloplasty (p= 0. 607), the use of a balloon (p= 0. 053), the relationship <b>balloon</b> / <b>ring</b> (p= 0. 108) or the gradient post valvuloplasty (p= 0. 559) was found. There was a clear relationship between the presence of isolated valvular stenosis and a lesser frequency of restenosis (p= 0. 000). Five patients (2. 6 %) required a second valvuloplasty. No relationship was found between valvular dysplasia, the initial transvalvular gradient, the residual gradient, the balloon/ring relation or the antecedent of previous surgery or valvuloplasty, with the need of a second valvuloplasty. Ten patients underwent surgery, all of them with an associated cardiopathy. In 97 (51. 8 %) patients, pulmonary insufficiency was found. In 96. 9 % it was trivial or minor, in 2. 1 % moderate and only in 1 % it was severe. 60 % of the patients, who were followed up, remain free from events (restenosis) after five years. In patients with stenosis alone, this percentage is 80 % with a statistical significant difference respect to those with an associated cardiopathy (p= 0. 000) The events-free survival when comparing critical patients with the non-critical ones, does not show a significant difference (p= 0. 850) and there was neither a difference for the newborns (p= 0. 752) ...|$|R
