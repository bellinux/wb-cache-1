After sundry inquiries about the changes that had taken place at Aden, the letter was suddenly produced by the Amir, who looked upon it suspiciously and bade me explain its contents. I was then asked by the Gerad whether it was my intention to buy and sell at Harar: the reply was, [...] "We are no buyers nor sellers [38]; we have become your guests to pay our respects to the Amir--whom may Allah preserve!--and that the friendship between the two powers may endure." [...] This appearing satisfactory, I added, in lively remembrance of the proverbial delays of Africa, where two or three months may elapse before a letter is answered or a verbal message delivered, that perhaps the Prince would be pleased to dismiss us soon, as the air of Harar was too dry for me, and my attendants were in danger of the small-pox, then raging in the town. The Amir, who was chary of words, bent towards the Gerad, who briefly ejaculated, [...] "The reply will be vouchsafed:" [...] with this unsatisfactory answer the interview ended.|$|E

40|$|ReportMesophotic reef fish assemblages (30 – 90 m depth) of {{the small}} and remote St. Peter and St. Paul’s Archipelago (SPSPA), Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Brazil, were {{characterized}} using remotely operated vehicles. Ordination analyses identified distinct fish assemblages in the upper (30 – 50 m) and lower (50 – 90 m) mesophotic zones, the former characterized by high abundances of species that are also abundant at euphotic reefs (Caranx lugubris, Melichthys niger, Stegastes sanctipauli and Chromis multilineata) and the latter dominated by two mesophotic specialists (Prognathodes obliquus and Chromis enchrysura). Planktivores dominated fish assemblages, particularly in the upper mesophotic zone, possibly due to a greater availability of zooplankton coming from the colder Equatorial Undercurrent in mesophotic depths of the SPSPA. Turf algae, fleshy macroalgae and scleractinian corals dominated benthic assemblages between 30 and 40 m depth, while bryozoans, <b>black</b> <b>corals</b> and sponges dominated between 40 and 90 m depth. Canonical correspondence analysis explained 74 % {{of the relationship between}} environmental characteristics (depth, benthic cover and complexity) and structure of fish assemblages, with depth as the most important independent variable. Juveniles of Bodianus insularis and adults of P. obliquus and C. enchrysura were clearly associated with branching <b>black</b> <b>corals</b> (Tanacetipathes spp.), suggesting that <b>black</b> <b>corals</b> play key ecological roles in lower mesophotic reefs of the SPSPA.

40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>corals</b> (Cnidaria, Antipatharia) {{from three}} {{different}} sources were investigated {{with the aim of}} detecting inorganic components and their morphology. In general, the skeleton of <b>black</b> <b>corals</b> was composed of the chitin fibrils admixed with peptides and the chitin presence was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR) and microRaman Microscopy, the latter giving the opportunity of tracing single fibrils and their location. The composition and concentrations of the inorganic components of the <b>black</b> <b>corals</b> were measured, using a scanning electron microprobe and micro-Particle Induced X-ray Emission (µ-PIXE). The application of such instruments enabled the estimation of the constituent distributions in a microscale. The mapping option was the most useful technique of making analyses in these studies, just to reveal the composition of chamber-like cells. Analysis of the morphology and microstructure showed that there were three distinct regions within the coral: a core and the cells encircled with adjacent interface gluing strips. The majority of the elements analyzed were selectively distributed and segregated in a striking way in mentioned distinctive zones of the skeleton and it was detected for the first time. The core area was characterized by the relatively elevated concentrations of Ca. The measurements gave extremely clear images of the distribution of particular elements in the skeletal tissue, with I, Ca, K and Fe much more concentrated in the gluing zones, while C, N, Na and Mg present in the interiors of particular skeletal cells. The distribution of some elements (Mg, Fe) and some compounds (chitin) and functional groups (S–S, C–I) allows differentiating the biological and mechanical functions of particular fragments of the rods. The kinds of elements and their concentrations measured were essentially in compliance with rare data available in the literature.
