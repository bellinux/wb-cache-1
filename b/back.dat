5|$|As the {{structure}} of the <b>back</b> is complex and the reporting of pain is subjective and affected by social factors, the diagnosis of low <b>back</b> pain is not straightforward. While most low <b>back</b> pain is caused by muscle and joint problems, this cause must be separated from neurological problems, spinal tumors, fracture of the spine, and infections, among others.|$|E

5|$|Between 1998–2001, Melbourne was {{the only}} club to display player names on the <b>back</b> of jerseys. This was {{because there was no}} major sponsor for the Storm to display on the chest or <b>back</b> at the time and in {{addition}} it helped supporters new to the game identify the players. In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco, and was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players names on the <b>back</b> until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the player's names and displayed Adecco's logo on the <b>back.</b> Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Carruthers is left-footed and is versatile, {{being able}} to play as a left <b>back,</b> left wing-back and left midfielder, {{although}} he has stated his strongest position is at left <b>back.</b> He has also played in a more attacking role as a left winger. He predominantly played as a left <b>back</b> for Northampton and Bristol Rovers, but on his arrival at York he was converted to playing in left midfield.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In a welded structure, thick {{plates are}} joined by multi-pass welding in the butt joint. During the first pass of multi-pass welding, burn-through, lack of fusion, and {{incomplete}} penetration were readily found as weld defects. Accordingly, the <b>backing</b> condition should be carefully selected in welding of a thick plate, because improper <b>backing</b> conditions lead to weld defects. In the job site, a steel <b>backing</b> strip is usually adopted, although it reduces the fatigue strength. No <b>backing</b> conditions or removable <b>backing</b> is recommended to increase the fatigue strength, but selection of the proper <b>backing</b> and welding conditions is complicated. In this study, several <b>backing</b> methods, such as ceramic <b>backing,</b> water-cooled copper <b>backing,</b> and even the use of no <b>backing,</b> were investigated during GMA (Gas Metal Arc) welding of a thick steel plate. The {{gas metal arc welding}} conditions were established for each <b>backing</b> method, and the bead shape and mechanical properties were examined after welding...|$|R

5|$|Cincinnati's ground {{offense was}} less {{statistically}} significant than its passing offense. It {{was led by}} running <b>back</b> Jacob Ramsey, who carried the ball 148times for 630yards and twotouchdowns. Backup running <b>back</b> John Goebel had 124 rushing attempts for 581yards and 7touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Defensive {{structures}} such as spines may be {{used both}} to ward off attack as already mentioned, and if need be to fight <b>back</b> against a predator. Methods of fighting <b>back</b> include chemical defences, mobbing, defensive regurgitation, and suicidal altruism.|$|E
5|$|Due to the breed's {{elongated}} body, {{there can}} be <b>back</b> problems within the breed, specifically with intervertebral discs in the dog's <b>back.</b> These discs can sometimes slip out of place, resulting in spinal disc herniation. Symptoms depend on {{what part of the}} dog's <b>back</b> is affected; they can include paralysis with loss of bladder and bowel control in the worst cases.|$|E

5|$|Eager to win Lexie <b>back,</b> Mark {{recruits}} his protégé Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) to try {{to bring}} him <b>back</b> into Lexie's favour, but his plan backfires when Jackson and Lexie develop romantic feelings for each other, resulting in them starting a relationship of their own. Mark is furious and tries to win Lexie <b>back,</b> but shortly after Callie is involved in a car accident and Lexie consoles Mark. The next episode, Lexie explains that she will go <b>back</b> to Mark if he continues to pursue her, but she believes they ultimately aren't suited and will be unhappy. Mark agrees to let her go, giving her and Jackson his blessing.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} be useful for {{preventing}} low <b>back</b> pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is little to no evidence that <b>back</b> belts are any more helpful in preventing low <b>back</b> pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low <b>back</b> pain.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>backs,</b> {{primarily}} older ones, require {{multiple exposures}} to capture an image; generally one each for red, green, and blue. These are called multi-shot or 3-shot <b>backs.</b> As technology advanced single-shot <b>backs</b> became more practical; by 2008 most <b>backs</b> manufactured were single-shot.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to Taylor's success passing the ball, the Hokies {{also had a}} successful running offense.

Combined with Taylor's rushing total, Virginia Tech gained 2,543yards and 30touchdowns on the ground.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the {{individually}} named rivers became known collectively as Bow <b>Back</b> Rivers. Charles Tween, writing {{on behalf of}} the Lee Conservancy, referred to them as both the Stratford <b>Back</b> Rivers and the Stratford <b>Back</b> Streams in 1905. The section {{to the west of the}} more recent City Mills Lock was labelled Bow <b>Back</b> River on a map of 1895, but had previously been part of Pudding Mill River.
