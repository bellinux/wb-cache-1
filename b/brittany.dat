She tells Santana of Rory's supposed magical powers, and Santana later coerces Rory into telling <b>Brittany</b> that Santana has wished for her to join Shelby's glee club. <b>Brittany</b> believes she must obey that wish, but her third wish is that doing so does not hurt anybody's feelings. New Directions co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) tries to persuade <b>Brittany</b> not to leave: he tells her that leprechauns are not real and that she is being stupid. <b>Brittany,</b> insulted, quits anyway.|$|E

5|$|Count Herbert II of Maine died in 1062, and William, who had betrothed {{his eldest}} son Robert to Herbert's sister Margaret, claimed the county through his son. Local nobles {{resisted}} the claim, but William invaded and by 1064 had secured control of the area. William appointed a Norman to the bishopric of Le Mans in 1065. He also allowed his son Robert Curthose to do homage to the new Count of Anjou, Geoffrey the Bearded. William's western border was thus secured, but his border with <b>Brittany</b> remained insecure. In 1064 William invaded <b>Brittany</b> in a campaign that remains obscure in its details. Its effect, though, was to destabilise <b>Brittany,</b> forcing the duke, Conan II, to focus on internal problems rather than on expansion. Conan's death in 1066 further secured William's borders in Normandy. William also benefited from his campaign in <b>Brittany</b> by securing the support of some Breton nobles {{who went on to}} support the invasion of England in 1066.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{marriage}} to Claude Duchess of <b>Brittany,</b> Francis I of France secured the Union of <b>Brittany</b> and France. On 13 August 1532, the Estates of <b>Brittany</b> confirmed the arrangement by signing the Edict of Union. Upon the death of Francis III, Duke of <b>Brittany</b> in 1536, the Duchy of <b>Brittany</b> passed to Henry II of France. Henry's status as king of France meant that the duchy became merely a French province. Institutions such as the Breton Estates and Parlement of <b>Brittany</b> continued to resist Paris in matters of taxation until their dissolution {{at the end of}} the 18th century. Breton nationalism saw a revival following the 1839 publication of Barzaz Breiz, a collection of traditional Breton folktales, songs and music. Pitre-Chevalier's 1844 Histoire de la Bretagne, followed in the same footsteps by highlighting a number of historical events as manifestations of Breton nationalism and aspirations of independence. Chevalier did not hesitate to distort the causes of revolts such as the Revolt of the papier timbré, in order to promote his agenda. The end of the 19th century was marked by the disintegration of archaic Breton social and economic structures with a parallel drive for compulsory primary education. During the course of the latter, primary teachers were specifically instructed with phasing out minority languages. Early Breton nationalist organizations such as Association Brettone (founded in 1829) focused on issues such as the preservation of the Breton language and administrative autonomy. By 1914, the Breton language had embraced by the region's intellectuals through a literary revival failing however to reach the masses.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{had begun}} to alter his policy of {{indirect}} rule in <b>Brittany</b> and started to exert more direct control. In 1164 Henry intervened to seize lands along the border of <b>Brittany</b> and Normandy, and in 1166 invaded <b>Brittany</b> to punish the local barons. Henry then forced Conan to abdicate as duke and to give <b>Brittany</b> to his daughter Constance; Constance was handed over and betrothed to Henry's son Geoffrey. This arrangement was quite unusual in terms of medieval law, as Conan might have had sons who could have legitimately inherited the duchy. Elsewhere in France, Henry attempted to seize the Auvergne, much to the anger of the French king. Further south Henry continued to apply pressure on Raymond of Toulouse: the King campaigned there personally in 1161, sent the Archbishop of Bordeaux against Raymond in 1164 and encouraged Alfonso II of Aragon in his attacks. In 1165 Raymond divorced Louis's sister and attempted to ally himself with Henry instead.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{expansion}} of the Roman Empire into the region, Gallic tribes had occupied the Armorican peninsula, dividing it into five regions that then formed the basis for the Roman administration of the area, and which survived into the period of the Duchy. These Gallic tribes (termed the Armorici in Latin), had close relationships with the Britonnes tribes in Roman Britain. Between the late 4th and the early 7th centuries, many of these Britonnes migrated to the Armorican peninsula, blending with the local people to form the later Britons, who eventually became the Bretons. These migrations from Britain contributed to Brittany's name, while also shaping its ethnic and linguistic identity. <b>Brittany</b> was divided into small, warring kingdoms, each competing for resources. The Frankish Carolingian Empire conquered the region during the 8th century, starting around 748 taking the whole of <b>Brittany</b> by 799. In 831 Louis the Pious appointed Nominoe, the Count of Vannes, as imperial missus dominicus for <b>Brittany.</b> The death of Louis in 840, sparked a civil war that fragmented the realm, enabling Nominoe to assert his authority over the former March of <b>Brittany.</b> In 846, the ruler of West Francia, Charles the Bald, signed a peace treaty with Nominoe, recognizing him as the first duke of <b>Brittany.</b>|$|E

5|$|Rebellions {{broke out}} in France and Anjou between 1111 and 1113, and Henry crossed into Normandy to support his nephew, Count Theobald of Blois, who had sided against Louis in the uprising. In a bid to diplomatically isolate the French King, Henry betrothed his young son, William Adelin, to Fulk's {{daughter}} Matilda, and married his illegitimate daughter Matilda to Conan III, the Duke of <b>Brittany,</b> creating alliances with Anjou and <b>Brittany</b> respectively. Louis backed down and in March 1113 met with Henry near Gisors to agree a peace settlement, giving Henry the disputed fortresses and confirming Henry's overlordship of Maine, Bellême and <b>Brittany.</b>|$|E
