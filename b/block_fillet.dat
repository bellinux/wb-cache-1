50|$|Salmon {{remains a}} major part of the annual operation, but in recent years the plant has {{expanded}} and streamlined whitefish operations. The plant produces several product forms including pollock <b>fillet</b> <b>block,</b> shatterpack <b>fillets,</b> mince and surimi. Cod shatterpack fillets and salt cod are mainstays. At peak seasons, both winter and summer, nearly 500 employees man the operation. King Cove's economy depends almost completely on the year-round commercial fishing and seafood processing industries. The PeterPan Seafoods' facility is one of the largest cannery operations under one roof in Alaska. 76 residents hold commercial fishing permits. Income is supplemented by subsistence activities.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} carried out in two {{research}} centres which are Centre 1 in Germany and Centre 2 in Ireland. In Centre 1, canning experiments were carried out by using blue whiting that had quality which was principal {{to be used as a}} raw material for canned products. However the quality was inferior when compared with commercial canned herring product in tomato sauce that is well accepted in German market. Centre 2 involved evaluation of the shelf life and sensory panel of blue whiting fillets. The blue whiting was sourced as <b>block</b> frozen <b>fillets</b> and individually quick frozen (IQF) fillets. They were tempered and evaluated as chilled fillets packed in modified atmosphere (MAP), or in air to assess their potential suitability for sale from chilled retail markets. Outcomes suggests that chilled Blue whiting <b>fillets</b> originating as <b>block</b> frozen or IQF samples have potential for sale in retail packs at 2 - 4 °C, especially when packed in MA and when cooked by pan frying. These have a high quality shelf life of about 5 days at 2 - 4 °C. Frozen breaded blue whiting goujons and nuggets were also well accepted. Further research was undertaken to observe some trace elements and cholesterol content in th...|$|R

40|$|In 1973, the New England Fishery Development Program (NEFDP), an industry/government {{partnership}} {{was formed}} to offset {{a portion of the}} economic decline of the New England fishing industry while encouraging the development of underutilized species and nontraditional fishery products. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine one of the NEFDP 2 ̆ 7 s development projects and to comment on its apparent success. This paper attempts to determine if domestic processors can be expected to produce whiting <b>fillet</b> <b>blocks</b> that can compete in the market place with foreign imports. Several aspects of the problem are favorably resolved-an abundant whiting resource is available; the domestic fleet has the capability to harvest the resource; a domestic processor has proven his ability to produce a high quality product; a significant demand for the product exists. The economic efficiency of full-scale commercial production has not been proven, however. Whether or not the production of whiting blocks can be a profitable venture for both the processor and the fisherman is still unknown...|$|R
40|$|Single {{and double}} frozen <b>fillet</b> <b>blocks</b> of Alaska pollack and cod both commercially {{processed}} of unknown shelf life were further processed to breaded battered portions. The quality of these fillet portions were compared using sensory (QDA), {{physical and chemical}} methods. It was difficult to differentiate between SF and DF fillets by sensory method because {{of the absence of}} differences in flavour attributes. While no differences could {{to be found in the}} texture of cod fillets, in Alaska pollack fillets some texture attributes were significantly different. These differences could not be verified by instrumental texture measurement. In all cases the lightness was different between SF and DF fillets. Probably, after having fixed L* values for SF fillets of commercially important fish species as limit this could be employed in the future to differentiate between single and double frozen products. Due to the unknown shelf life it is difficult to evaluate the results. Therefore, the investigation of the influence of double freezing on the quality needs a special sample preparation. The use of randomly taken commercially processed samples seems not to be useful...|$|R
