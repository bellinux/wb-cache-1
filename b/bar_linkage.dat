2500|$|Before the {{development}} of the double acting piston, the linkage to the beam and the piston rod had been by means of a chain, which meant that power could only be applied in one direction, by pulling. This was effective in engines that were used for pumping water, but the double action of the piston meant that it could push as well as pull. This was not possible as long as the beam and the rod were connected by a chain. Furthermore, {{it was not possible to}} connect the piston rod of the sealed cylinder directly to the beam, because while the rod moved vertically in a straight line, the beam was pivoted at its centre, with each side inscribing an arc. To bridge the conflicting actions of the beam and the piston, Watt developed his parallel motion. This masterpiece of engineering uses a four <b>bar</b> <b>linkage</b> coupled with a pantograph to produce the required straight line motion much more cheaply than if he had used a slider type of linkage. [...] He was very proud of his solution.|$|E

50|$|During the Industrial Revolution, {{mechanisms}} for converting rotary into linear motion were widely adopted in industrial and mining machinery, locomotives and metering devices. Such devices had to combine engineering simplicity {{with a high}} degree of accuracy, and the ability to operate at speed for lengthy periods. For many purposes approximate linear motion is an acceptable substitute for exact linear motion. Perhaps the best known example is the Watt four <b>bar</b> <b>linkage,</b> invented by the Scottish engineer James Watt in 1784.|$|E

40|$|The dwell {{zones of}} a {{shedding}} cam allow lower {{strain on the}} wrap sheet compared to linkage driven dobbies for the same warp interference factor. Cam driven dobbies can be designed with dwell zones but they give higher jerk compared to linkage driven dobbies. This work explores the use of six <b>bar</b> <b>linkages</b> for driving dobbies which will allow the healds to be in near dwell condition during picking. The healds must be level at the same position in each loom cycle. This requires a mechanism with two nearly equal and symmetrical dwell zones in a crank cycle. The challenges in designing such a mechanism have been outlined in this paper and two possible solutions have been suggested...|$|R

5000|$|Metal bondage is bondage {{involving}} {{the use of}} metal apparatus to restrain a submissive as part of BDSM activities. In contrast {{to the use of}} rope to secure a body, metal bondage normally requires careful preparation, since more extravagant devices have either to be built or bought from a specialist. The range of devices can vary significantly, from simple handcuffs or chains to specifically designed chairs or complex <b>bar</b> <b>linkages.</b> Chains are occasionally preferred for suspension due to their strong nature and ability to hold large amounts of weight including various other objects on top of the person being suspended. Because they feel cold to touch and rattle and clank chains add auditory and tactile sensory stimulation to the bondage scene, and can similarly be used to enhance the atmosphere of a dungeon.|$|R
5000|$|The {{double-wishbone}} suspension {{can also be}} referred to as [...] "double A-arms", though the arms themselves can be A-shaped, L-shaped, or even a single <b>bar</b> <b>linkage.</b> A single wishbone or A-arm can also be used in various other suspension types, such as variations of the MacPherson strut. The upper arm is usually shorter to induce [...] negative camber as the suspension jounces (rises), and often this arrangement is titled an [...] "SLA" [...] or [...] "short long arms" [...] suspension. When the vehicle is in a turn, body roll results in positive camber gain on the lightly loaded inside wheel, while the heavily loaded outer wheel gains negative camber.|$|E
50|$|The Oshkosh TAK-4 (and TAK-4i) {{suspension}} {{is known}} as double wishbone independent suspension. This is an independent suspension design using two wishbone-shaped arms to locate the wheel.

The shock absorber and spring mount to the lower arm to control vertical movement. The double-wishbone suspension can also be referred to as ‘double A-arm,’ though the arms themselves can be A-shaped, L-shaped, or even a single <b>bar</b> <b>linkage.</b> The complete TAK-4 independent suspension system set-up also includes a subframe which contains the axle differential, half shafts, and wheel ends with steering attachments and brakes.|$|E
50|$|Whilst the Clever {{vehicle was}} {{intended}} to use a low emission engine burning compresses natural gas, the research prototype at the University of Bath uses a 13 kW 176cc single cylinder engine taken from BMW C1 scooter. The original CVT gearbox is retained (albeit modified to provide a power take off to drive the pump for the tilt hydraulics); belt drives are used to transmit power to the two rear wheels. Rear suspension is by way of independent trailing arms, adjustable Öhlins spring/damper units and an anti-roll bar. The front wheel is suspended by a leading four <b>bar</b> <b>linkage</b> with a single Öhlins spring/damper unit and uses a hub-centric steering system. A single track-rod transmits steer inputs to the front wheel from the output arm of a worm-gear steering box, the driver’s steer inputs are transmitted to the steering box via a modified wheel and column sourced from a BMW car.|$|E
40|$|Mechanisms are {{means of}} power {{transmission}} {{as well as}} motion transformers. A fourbar mechanism consists mainly of four planar links connected with four revolute joints. The input is usually given as rotary motion of a link and output {{can be obtained from}} the motion of another link or a coupler point. Straight line motion from a four <b>bar</b> <b>linkages</b> has been used in several ways as in a dwell mechanism and as a linkage to vehicle suspension. This paper studies the straight line motion obtained from planar four-bar mechanisms and optimizes the design to produce the maximized straight line portion of the coupler point curve. The equations of motion for four different four-bar mechanisms will be derived and dimensional requirements for these mechanisms will be obtained in order to produce the straight line motion. A numerical procedure will be studied and computer codes that generate the coupler curves will be presented. Following the numerical results study, a synthesis procedure will be given to help a designer in selecting the optimized straight line motion based on design criteria...|$|R
40|$|The {{gripping}} arms of today’s grapples {{follow a}} circular motion {{which means that}} the grapple must be lowered or heightened continuously by the operator to avoid that the timber is missed or that damage of the ground surface occurs. Because of this LIAB (Lima Innovation AB) wants to examine the possibilities to construct a new grapple that solves this problem. The goal of this thesis work is to construct a grapple, which fits existing forwarders, that minimizes the digging motion. Throughout the project a product development process, elaborated at Luleå University of Technology, called Sirius Masterplan has been followed. The use of, among other things, motion- and FEM-analysis has resulted in solid models of a grapple that, with the aid of four <b>bar</b> <b>linkages,</b> performs a close to linear motion along the ground.

50|$|Watt's linkage {{consists}} of a chain of three rods, two longer and equal length ones on the outside ends of the chain, connected by a short rod in the middle. The outer endpoints of the long rods are fixed in place relative to each other, and otherwise the three rods are free to pivot around the joints where they meet. Thus, counting the fixed-length connection between the outer endpoints as another <b>bar,</b> Watt's <b>linkage</b> {{is an example of}} a four-bar linkage.|$|R
50|$|Placoderms were a {{class of}} fish, heavily {{armoured}} {{at the front of}} their body, which first appeared in the fossil records during the Silurian about 430 million years ago. Initially they very successful, diversifying remarkably during the Devonian. They became extinct {{by the end of that}} period, about 360 million years ago. Their largest species, Dunkleosteus terrelli, measured up to 10 m and weighed 3.6 t. It possessed a four <b>bar</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanism for jaw opening that incorporated connections between the skull, the thoracic shield, the lower jaw and the jaw muscles joined together by movable joints. This mechanism allowed Dunkleosteus terrelli to achieve a high speed of jaw opening, opening their jaws in 20 milliseconds and completing the whole process in 50-60 milliseconds, comparable to modern fishes that use suction feeding to assist in prey capture. They could also produce high bite forces when closing the jaw, estimated at 6000 N at the tip and 7400 N at the blade edge in the largest individuals. The pressures generated in those regions were high enough to puncture or cut through cuticle or dermal armour suggesting that Dunkleosteus terrelli was perfectly adapted to prey on free-swimming, armoured prey like arthropods, ammonites, and other placoderms.|$|E

The most simple solution to transforming the action of the beam into a rotating motion was to connect the beam to a wheel by a crank, but because another party had patent rights on the use of the crank, Watt was obliged to come up with another solution. He adopted the epicyclic sun and planet gear system suggested by an employee William Murdoch, only later reverting, once the patent rights had expired, to the more familiar crank seen on most engines today. The main wheel attached to the crank was large and heavy, serving as a flywheel which, once set in motion, by its momentum maintained a constant power and smoothed the action of the alternating strokes. To its rotating central shaft, belts and gears could be attached to drive a great variety of machinery.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} effect of hamstrings and quadriceps contractions on hip and knee joint motion was investigated using a dynamic {{model of the}} musculoskeletal system. The model consisted of 13 anatomically linked segments. The geometry of bones, joints, and muscle attachments was derived from magnetic resonance imaging of a healthy adult. The knee joint was represented by a crossing <b>bars</b> <b>linkage</b> to simulate cruciate ligament function, and muscles were represented by spring actuators. The effects of hamstring and quadriceps contractions, in various combinations, were tested on different configurations of hip and knee joint position {{in the absence of}} gravity. In the standing posture, with the foot free to move and the pelvis fixed in space, the effect of semimembranosus (SM) contraction was hip and knee flexion. If the foot was fixed to the ground, SM contraction produced hip extension and knee flexion. The addition of quadriceps contraction reduced or abolished the knee flexion and enhanced hip extension. In all other simulations, SM alone produced knee flexion and hip extension and the combination of SM with vastus (VA) and rectus femoris (RF) contractions resulted in knee extension and enhanced hip extension. Our findings suggest that co-contraction of quadriceps and hamstrings may be a strategy to increase the hip extension function of the hamstrings. Copyright © 2009 Elsevier B. V.

These cars maintain an exact height over the road when the engine is on - height control valves attached to the roll <b>bars</b> via <b>linkages</b> would open to add or drain fluid from the suspension, and when the desired height was reached the valve would automatically close due to its design.

40|$|Problem statement: Underactuated finger {{mechanism}} is beneficial in the anthropomorphic applications {{in which it}} reduces the finger size, weight and power consumption due to the less number of actuators compared to its number of Degree Of Freedom (DOF). However, the currently existing underactuated finger is limited to grasping operations only and unable to pinch with the finger tip. Moreover, the behavior of such finger in achieving the desired configuration depends greatly on its geometric parameters. Therefore, this study presented a new <b>bar</b> <b>linkage</b> type underactuated finger mechanism with an optimized parameter set that resembled the human finger in performing both pinching and grasping operation. Approach: The existing seven <b>bar</b> <b>linkage</b> underactuated finger mechanism was modified by adding a guiding slot in the upper middle phalange link so that its length can be adjusted to achieve human fingers configuration during pinching and grasping. A multiobjective optimization problem subjected to parameter constraints was then formulated using the evaluation criteria for human finger kinematics during pinching and grasping. Results: The numerical result obtained gave an improved set of geometrical parameter to achieve these configurations as it provided less error than the initial guess. Conclusion: A new underactuated finger mechanism that resembled the human finger to perform both pinching and grasping operation was presented in this study.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to develop a}} pin router {{duplicator}} to accurately produce guitar bodies, necks, and fret boards. The pin router duplicator is designed to speed up the production process for the class Lean Manufacturing (MET 345), offered at Central Washington University. In the class, students learn how to work as a team to improve the way a woodshop is ran. In Lean Manufacturing, guitar bodies, necks, and fret boards are produced by using a CNC router. For this project, the motivation is to increase production by reducing production time. Accuracy and repeatability is also taken into consideration. With the use of the pin router duplicator, more than three guitar bodies will be produced in two hours, which will help with production goals. The methods that are used to arrive at the finished design are by using kinematics, stress, engineering, and static analysis. Free body diagrams, shear, and moment diagrams were used to calculate the reaction forces, {{in order to determine the}} appropriate thickness of the material. The final design that’s going to be used is a 4 <b>bar</b> <b>linkage</b> system. The final design resulted in relief of bottlenecks, which allows for increased production. By using these methods, the necessary components for the 4 <b>bar</b> <b>linkage</b> system are designed.

40|$|A {{new class}} of six-degree-of-freedom (six-DOF) {{parallel}} minimanipulators is introduced. The minimanipulators are designed to provide high resolution and high stiffness in fine- manipulation operations. Two-DOF planar mechanisms (e. g., five- <b>bar</b> <b>linkages,</b> pantographs) and inextensible limbs are used to improve positional resolution and stiffness of the minimanipulators. The two-DOF mechanisms serve as drivers for the minimanipulators. The minimanipulators require only three inextensible limbs and unlike most of the six-limbed parallel manipulators, their direct kinematics {{can be reduced to}} solving a polynomial in a single variable. All of the minimanipulator actuators are base-mounted. As a result, higher payload capacity, smaller actuator sizes, and lower power dissipation can be obtained. Inverse kinematics of the minimanipulators has been reduced to solving three decoupled quadratic equations, each of which contains only one unknown. Kinematic inversion is used to reduce the direct kinematics of the minimanipulator to an eighth- degree polynomial in the square of a single variable. Hence, the maximum number of assembly configurations for the minimanipulator is sixteen. It is proved that the sixteen solutions are eight pairs of reflected configurations with respect to the plane passing through the lower ends of the three limbs. The Jacobian and stiffness matrices of two types of minimanipulators are derived. It is shown that, at a central configuration, the stiffness matrix of the first type minimanipulator (driven by bidirectional linear stepper motors) can be decoupled, if proper design parameters are chosen. It is also shown that the stiffness of the minimanipulators is higher than that of the Stewart platform. Guidelines for obtaining large stiffness values and for designing the drivers of the second type minimanipulator (simplified five-bar linkages) are established. An algorithm is developed to determine the workspace of the minimanipulators. Given any orientation for the output link, three-dimensional representation of the workspace is obtained. Guidelines for avoiding discontinuities inside of the workspace are established. Necessary and sufficient conditions for both inverse and direct kinematics singularities of the minimanipulators are obtained. Guidelines for avoiding direct kinematics singularities, which occur within the minimanipulator workspace, are established...|$|R

The main results of the paper apply to planar linkages as well as for linkages in R 3. We also prove results about higher moments of Betti numbers. ...|$|R
