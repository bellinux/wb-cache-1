Instead they usually have one-sided serifs that curve up on the outstroke (contrast the flat two-sided serifs of a roman font). One uncommon exception to this is Hermann Zapf's Melior.

50|$|The {{calculated}} compression ratio, as given above, {{presumes that}} the cylinder is sealed at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke,</b> {{and that the}} volume compressed is the actual volume.|$|R
50|$|In a piston engine, it is {{the ratio}} between {{the volume of the}} {{cylinder}} and combustion chamber when the piston is at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke,</b> and the volume of the combustion chamber when the piston is at the top <b>of</b> its <b>stroke.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{compression}} ratio affects the performance in most types of reciprocating engine. It is the ratio between {{the volume of}} the cylinder, when the piston is at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke,</b> and the volume when the piston is at the top <b>of</b> its <b>stroke.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke,</b> {{the exhaust}} valve to the {{condenser}} is closed and the equilibrium valve is opened. The weight of the pump gear draws the piston up, and as the piston comes up, steam is transferred through the equilibrium pipe from above the piston to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the cylinder below the piston.|$|R
50|$|The 'dead centre' of a {{piston engine}} with cranks {{is when the}} piston is at the exact top or <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke</b> and so the piston cannot exert any torque on the crankshaft. If a steam engine stops on dead centre, it {{will be unable to}} restart from that position.|$|R
50|$|Biopace {{chainring}}s have {{a reduced}} chainring diameter {{coinciding with the}} cranks being horizontal. This is supposed to smooth the pedaling action, allowing the rider's feet to carry more momentum through the power stroke, and having it smoothly removed at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke</b> rather than encouraging riders to push bigger gears and risk knee damage due to higher knee joint loadings.|$|R
50|$|Compression {{serves to}} {{increase}} the proportion of energy which can be extracted from the hot gas and should be optimised for a given application. Too high a compression can cause detonation, which is undesirable compared with a smooth, controlled burn. Too low a compression may result in the fuel/air mixture still burning when the piston reaches the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke</b> and the exhaust valve opens.|$|R
5000|$|... "Diamond" [...] or [...] "Triceps" [...] push-ups {{are done}} by placing both palms {{on the ground}} and {{touching}} together both thumbs and pointer fingers. This technique requires stronger triceps muscles than regular push-ups due to the fact that, at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke,</b> the forearm is nearly parallel to the ground and the elbow is almost completely flexed, resulting in much higher mechanical load on the triceps.|$|R
50|$|For example, a {{cylinder}} and its combustion chamber with the piston at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke</b> may contain 1000 cc of air (900 cc in the cylinder plus 100 cc in the combustion chamber). When the piston has {{moved up to}} the top <b>of</b> its <b>stroke</b> inside the cylinder, and the remaining volume inside the head or combustion chamber has been reduced to 100 cc, then the compression ratio would be proportionally described as 1000:100, or with fractional reduction, a 10:1 compression ratio.|$|R
50|$|Adrien {{subsequently}} {{made several}} improvements to his compressor. One problem with his original compressor {{was that the}} effort that was required to compress the gas was greatest at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the piston's <b>stroke,</b> {{at which point the}} gas's pressure was greatest. Adrien solved this problem by using a fusée, a device that watch makers used to allow a watch's mainspring to exert a constant torque as the mainspring unwound and its force became weaker. Adrien reversed the function of the fusée: in his compressor, the fusée allowed a constant force that was supplied by the compressor's source of power (men) to be converted into a force that increased as the piston neared the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke.</b> Thanks to this modification, one man could now power the compressor instead of the ten men that had been required earlier. He also changed the method of cooling the compressor, and he reduced the number of cylinders from three to two. He obtained a patent for this improved compressor.|$|R
50|$|The piston {{then moves}} downward,where the air-fuel mixture remains from the {{previous}} intake-compression stroke. Shortly after the exhaust port is uncovered by the downward travel of the piston, the transfer ports begin to be uncovered. The transfer ports act as a passage through which the air-fuel mixture moves from the crankcase into the cylinder above the piston. Once the piston reaches the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke,</b> the second stroke is completed and the process is repeated.|$|R
5000|$|The cycle {{starts with}} the piston at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke.</b> As it rises, it draws air into the {{crankcase}} through the inlet port. At the same time fuel is sprayed into the vaporiser. The charge of air {{on top of the}} piston is compressed into the vaporiser, where it is mixed with the atomised fuel and ignites. The piston is driven down the cylinder. As it descends, the piston first uncovers the exhaust port. The pressurised exhaust gases flow out of the cylinder. A fraction after the exhaust port is uncovered, the descending piston uncovers the transfer port. The piston is now pressurising the air in the crankcase, which is forced through the transfer port and into the space above the piston. Part of the incoming air charge is lost out of the still-open exhaust port to ensure all the exhaust gases are cleared from the cylinder, a process known as [...] "scavenging". The piston then reaches the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke</b> and begins to rise again, drawing a fresh charge of air into the crankcase and completing the cycle. Induction and compression are carried out on the upward stroke, while power and exhaust occur on the downward stroke.|$|R
5000|$|... "Biopace" [...] - is the Shimano tradename for {{a type of}} ovoid cycle {{chainring}} manufactured from 1983 to 1993. Biopace chainrings are non-round, {{but unlike}} traditional oval chainrings which tend to have the largest effective gearing coincide with the downstroke, with Biopace the rings are oriented so the effectively reduced chainring diameter now coincides with the cranks being (at or near) horizontal, and the increased chainring diameter coincides with the pedals being close to TDC and BDC. The reasoning behind {{this is that it}} smooths the pedaling action, allowing the rider to carry a lot of momentum through the (downwards-based) power stroke, having it smoothly removed at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Named for the {{movement}} of the transfer mechanism, tri-axis transfer mechanisms motion is defined by the three (3) axes of movement made by the part manipulators each press stroke. On the press downstroke the automation which will likely be holding the work piece will lower the work piece to the tool and retract to leave the part on the tool. At the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke</b> the automation mechanism in the retracted state will cycle backward one pitch to position itself adjacent to the next workpiece. As the press cycles upward the part manipulators will index inward to pick up the next work piece, continuing upward following the press ram, then indexing forward to next station. As the press reaches the top <b>of</b> its <b>stroke,</b> the process repeats. The three axes of motion are up-down, in-out, and forward-back.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the ideal}} Otto cycle engine, the vacuum engine {{relies on a}} {{constant}} heat source provided by burning fuel. As mentioned above, a valve allows an intake of heat into the piston chamber. Estimating the heat in or Qin is constant in the controlled volume space, the ideal gas equation PV = nRT implies {{an increase in the}} pressure of the piston chamber. After the valve closes, the piston undergoes an adiabatic process during the downward stroke. Once the piston reaches the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke,</b> the chamber is cooled either by the surrounding air or water, and the resulting Qout forces the pressure in the piston to decrease. The system then undergoes another adiabatic compression of the gas in the chamber, which is subsequently released by the valve at the top <b>of</b> the cylinder's <b>stroke,</b> while simultaneously allowing new heated gas to enter the chamber.|$|R
25|$|The {{reciprocating}} sleeve valves were open-ended, {{rather than}} sealing in a junk head. The open end uncovered the exhaust ports {{high in the}} cylinder wall at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the sleeves' <b>stroke,</b> leaving the ports cut into the sleeve to handle the incoming charge only. The sleeves had a <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> 30% of the piston travel at 1.950 in (49.5mm) and operated 15 degrees {{in advance of the}} crankshaft. The Crecy sleeve valves were of similar construction but differed in their operation compared to the rotary sleeve valve design that was pioneered by Roy Fedden, and used successfully {{for the first time in}} an aircraft engine, the Bristol Perseus, in 1932.|$|R
40|$|A {{method that}} {{makes use of}} {{thermocouples}} has been developed to measure the temperature of engine pistons operating at high speeds. The thermocouples installed on the moving piston are connected with a potentiometer outside the engine by means of pneumatically operated plungers, which {{make contact with the}} piston thermocouples for about 10 crankshaft degrees at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the piston <b>stroke.</b> The equipment is operated satisfactory at engine speeds of 2, 400 r. p. m. and shows promise of successful operation at higher engine speeds. Measurements of piston temperatures in a liquid-cooled compression-ignition engine and in an air-cooled spark-ignition are presented...|$|R
50|$|The {{spring rate}} (or {{suspension}} rate) is a component {{in setting the}} vehicle's ride height or its location in the suspension stroke. When a spring is compressed or stretched, the force it exerts is proportional to its change in length. The spring rate or spring constant of a spring is {{the change in the}} force it exerts, divided by the change in deflection of the spring. Vehicles which carry heavy loads will often have heavier springs to compensate for the additional weight that would otherwise collapse a vehicle to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> its travel (<b>stroke).</b> Heavier springs are also used in performance applications where the loading conditions experienced are more extreme.|$|R
5000|$|The {{benefits}} of direct injection {{are even more}} pronounced in two-stroke engines, because it eliminates much of the pollution they cause. In all two-strokes other than those with split-single engines or similarly sophisticated arrangements, the exhaust and intake ports are both open at the same time, at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the piston <b>stroke,</b> for [...] "scavenging". In conventional two-strokes, {{a portion of the}} fuel/air mixture entering the cylinder from the crankcase through the intake ports goes directly out, unburned, through the exhaust port. With direct injection, only air (and usually some oil) comes from the crankcase, and fuel is not injected until the piston rises and all ports are closed.|$|R
5000|$|Excepting {{commemorative}} varieties, {{there have}} been a number of varieties of regular issue coins identified by collectors, of both the obverse and reverse.

These coins are now sold for over $200, depending on condition. Other varieties sited of the obverse generally revolve around the length and number of the claws of the platypus. These are prone to changing if incorrect stamping pressure is used in creation of dies for the coins. Consequentially, these are often seen in coins produced at foreign mints.|$|R

50|$|The only {{moving parts}} inside simple {{two-stroke}} engines are the crankshaft, the connecting rod, and the piston. It {{is the same}} simplicity in design, however, that causes a two-stroke engine to be less fuel-efficient and produce high specific levels of undesirable exhaust gas emissions. At the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the power <b>stroke,</b> the transfer ports, which deliver fresh fuel, are open {{at the same time}} as the exhaust port. This can allow a significant amount of fresh fuel to run straight through the engine without ever being available for power production. Properly designed exhaust systems help minimize the amount of raw fuel loss in the exhaust process, but a two-stroke engine will always waste some fuel (modern direct injected engines being an exception to this).|$|R
40|$|Dimethyl ether (DME) is an {{alternative}} fuel which, of late, has shown tremendous potential in reducing the pollution emissions of automobiles. Simultaneously, electronic actuated fuel injectors, {{with the use of}} solenoids, have repeatedly demonstrated superior performance with respect to needle movement control. This thesis, in order to combine the advantages of both electronic actuation and DME fuel, presents an adaptation of the novel use of solenoid operated fuel injectors with DME. The thesis also sets to reduce injector nozzle seat wear, by reducing the bouncing of the injector needle at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke.</b> The injector design presented incorporates a lengthened elastic rod, a new driving circuit for the solenoid, and incorporates them into a common rail system. The thesis also presents, {{for the first time in}} the literature, a methodology for measuring the force acting on the nozzle seat in injector closing. Through modeling, simulation and testing, an injector compatible with DME fuel was designed, where injector needle movement was properly controlled, and nozzle seat force reduced. As such, an important step has been taken in developing technology allowing DME to be a more common alternative fuel in automobiles...|$|R
2500|$|The {{solution}} to draining deep mines {{was found by}} Thomas Newcomen who developed an [...] "atmospheric" [...] engine that also worked on the vacuum principle. It employed a cylinder containing a movable piston connected by a chain to {{one end of a}} rocking beam that worked a mechanical lift pump from its opposite end. At the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> each <b>stroke,</b> steam was allowed to enter the cylinder below the piston. As the piston rose within the cylinder, drawn upward by a counterbalance, it drew in steam at atmospheric pressure. At the top <b>of</b> the <b>stroke</b> the steam valve was closed, and cold water was briefly injected into the cylinder as a means of cooling the steam. This water condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum below the piston. The atmospheric pressure outside the engine was then greater than the pressure within the cylinder, thereby pushing the piston into the cylinder. The piston, attached to a chain and in turn attached to one end of the [...] "rocking beam", pulled down the end of the beam, lifting {{the opposite end of the}} beam. Hence, the pump deep in the mine attached to opposite end of the beam via ropes and chains was driven. The pump pushed, rather than pulled the column of water upward, hence it could lift water any distance. Once the piston was at the bottom, the cycle repeated.|$|R
5000|$|In 1913, Louis Seguin and {{his brother}} Laurent (engineers who founded the Société Des Moteurs Gnome Gnome motor company in 1905) {{introduced}} the new Monosoupape series, which eliminated the inlet valve, replacing it with piston-controlled transfer ports {{similar to those found}} in a two-stroke engine. Beginning with the power stroke, the four-stroke engine operated normally until the piston was just about to reach the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke</b> (<b>bottom</b> dead center, or BDC), when the exhaust valve was opened [...] "early". This let the still-hot burnt combustion gases [...] "pop" [...] out of the engine while the piston was still moving down, relieving exhaust pressure and preventing exhaust gases from entering the crankcase. After a small additional amount of travel, the piston uncovered 36 small ports {{around the base of the}} cylinder, leading to the crankcase which held additional fuel-air mixture (the charge). No transfer took place at this point since there was no pressure differential; the cylinder was still open to the air and thus at ambient pressure. The overhead valve exhausted directly into the slipstream since no exhaust manifold could be practically fitted to the spinning crankcase and cylinders, partly in order to save weight and prevent excessive amounts of centrifugal forces in flight.|$|R

40|$|The organic gas {{emissions}} from a stoichiometric direct injection {{spark ignition engine}} operating on ethanol/gasoline blends have been assessed under warmed-up and cold idle conditions. The speciated emissions show that the total organic {{gas emissions}} (in ppm C 1) decrease with increase in ethanol content. The mole fraction of ethanol in the exhaust {{is proportional to the}} volume fraction of ethanol in the fuel: a 10 per cent increase in the latter would yield a 5. 5 per cent increase in the former. The ethanol–acetaldehyde ratio (by mol) in the exhaust is 6. These results hold for both the warmed-up and the cold idle conditions, with the exception of E 85 at cold idle because of the difficulty in fuel evaporation. The dependence of the organic gas emissions on injection timing may be divided into three regimes. With early injection, the fuel bounce from the piston results in high emissions. With injection in mid-stroke, the emissions are low and not sensitive to the fuel pressure. With injection close to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke,</b> the interaction <b>of</b> the fuel deposit on the wall and the piston (which comes up shortly) results in higher emissions. The behaviour is similar for all the ethanol/gasoline blends with the exception of E 85 under cold idle condition. Engine and Fuels Research Consortiu...|$|R

50|$|If the {{exercise}} {{is not done}} correctly or the rider's position is bad, injuries can occur; problems with the lower back and knees are most common. To avoid injury and aid comfort {{it is important to}} make sure the bio-mechanical position of the rider is correct. Group cycling bikes have a wide range of adjustment, and it is essential to obtain the correct setup prior to riding. The seat position must be right for the participant's height. The height of the seat should be in level with the hip when the participant is standing next to the cycle. Horizontally, the seat should be set in order for the front of the knee to be directly in vertical line with the ball of the foot when the pedal is pointing forward. This results in a position where the knee is slightly bent at an angle between 25% and 35% when the leg is extended with the foot resting flat at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the pedal <b>stroke.</b> Handlebar height can be adjusted for comfort; less experienced riders may want to set them higher to ease lower back discomfort.

40|$|A simple {{model from}} first {{principles}} {{has been developed}} to estimate the heat transferred from the piston rings and skirt to the cylinder wall. The model considers the various forms in which heat is transferred from the combustion gases to the containing walls, namely, convection and radiation between the gases and wall surface, and conduction from piston rings and skirt through the oil film. The model also includes frictional heat generation by the rings and skirt {{as a result of}} the piston movement. Results presented in this paper show that the heat flux predicted by the model on the thrust side of the bore, at an engine speed of 4000 rpm and engine load of 100 % of the limiting torque, was generally of the same order of magnitude as the heat flux estimated from experimental measurements.

50|$|From an army manual on {{pile driving}} hammers:The initial start {{up of the}} hammer {{requires}} the piston (ram) to be raised {{to a point where}} the trip automatically releases the piston, allowing it to fall by gravity. As the piston falls, it activates the fuel pump, which discharges a metered amount of fuel into the ball pan of the impact block. The falling piston also blocks the exhaust ports, and compression of fuel trapped in the cylinder begins. The compressed air exerts a pre-load force to hold the impact block firmly against the drive cap and pile. At the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the compression <b>stroke,</b> the piston strikes the impact block, atomizing the fuel and starting the pile on its downward movement. In the instant after the piston strikes, the atomized fuel ignites, and the resulting explosion exerts an even greater force on the already moving pile, driving it further into the ground. The reaction of the explosion rebounding from the resistance of the pile drives the piston upward. As the piston rises, the exhaust ports open, releasing the gases and force of the explosion into the atmosphere. After the piston stops its upward movement, it again falls by gravity to start another cycle.|$|R
