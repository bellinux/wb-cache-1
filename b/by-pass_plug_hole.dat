40|$|Abstract: In {{contrast}} to traditional coal separation, dry separation {{does not require}} water and does not cause water pollution. Dense phase gas–solid fluidized beds are used for dry separation. The <b>plugged</b> <b>holes</b> in the air distributor should be tested to ensure the stability of these beds for particle separation. The pressure fluctuation is sensitive to these <b>plugged</b> <b>holes.</b> This sensitivity can be tested and diagnosed by determining the standard deviation of the pressure fluctuation. In areas with partial blockage, that is the areas with weak fluidization, {{a decrease in the}} volume fraction of the particles and in the pressure differences in the transverse of the bed results in an increase of the standard deviation of the pressure fluctuation, thereby stimulating the lateral mixing of medium-sized particles. The standard deviation and the mixing intensity decrease axially. The value of sensitivity of the <b>plugged</b> <b>holes</b> in the air distributor decreases as the height of the bed increases. The features of air distributors affect the surrounding areas. The distribution law determining the influence of <b>plugged</b> <b>holes</b> on the beds is symmetrical. As the blockage of the fluidized bed distributor region increases, the mean square error of the pressure fluctuation in the related regions increases. The intensity of the effect is proportional to the distance to the <b>plugged</b> <b>holes...</b>|$|R
25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} misconception, water {{rotation}} in home bathrooms {{under normal circumstances}} {{is not related to}} the Coriolis effect or to the rotation of the Earth, and no consistent difference in rotation direction between toilet drainage in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres can be observed. The formation of a vortex over the <b>plug</b> <b>hole</b> may be explained by the conservation of angular momentum: The radius of rotation decreases as water approaches the <b>plug</b> <b>hole,</b> so the rate of rotation increases, {{for the same reason that}} an ice skater's rate of spin increases as they pull their arms in. Any rotation around the <b>plug</b> <b>hole</b> that is initially present accelerates as water moves inward.|$|R

40|$|The {{canonical}} role of platelets is hemostasis {{in which}} they function as highly specialized cells designed to <b>plug</b> <b>holes</b> in the blood vascular system. To accomplish this task, platelets have evolved unique molecular tools {{that enable them to}} func-tion in the vascular environment, such as the GPIbα receptor complex that mediates platelet adhesion to the vessel wall in the face of high shear forces and stringent activation pathways that trigger adhesive interactions mediated by integrin recep-tors. It is becoming increasing apparent that platelets may also use these specialized molecular tools to perform vascu-lar tasks other than <b>plugging</b> <b>holes</b> and preventing blood loss. Some of these more recently defined roles seem to be variants of their canonical role, for example, lymphovenous hemosta-sis that controls the flow of lymph into the blood circulation, 1 and inflammatory hemostasis that prevents bleeding at sites of extremely high vascular permeability. 2 Others seem to be trul...|$|R

50|$|Two crafts {{with about}} 40 {{survivors}} each, including Cabeza de Vaca, wrecked {{on or near}} Galveston Island (now part of Texas). Out of the 80 or so survivors, only 15 lived past that winter. The explorers called the island Malhado (“Ill fate” in Spanish), or the Island of Doom.

50|$|Many {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the old BL 15 pounder barrels to adapt them to a new carriage with a recoil buffer and recuperator above the barrel similar to the modern 13 pounder design. Previously, the barrels had been mounted directly on the carriage by trunnions. Now, the barrel was suspended from a forged-steel inverted U-shaped cradle which had trunnions to attach it to the carriage. The trunnions, sight brackets and elevating gear attachment lugs were removed from the barrel. The radial T-vent hole on top was <b>plugged,</b> <b>holes</b> in the jacket passing through the trunnion centres were sealed with screwed steel <b>plugs,</b> and the <b>holes</b> in the hood for fitting tangent sights were plugged with white metal alloy.|$|R

50|$|These plugs can be {{installed}} {{in a variety of}} different ways in order to create the correct degree of strength needed for the fin to function. The more common method is to drill the <b>plug</b> <b>hole</b> {{at the end of the}} shaping process and then secure the <b>plug</b> in the <b>hole</b> with resin. The plug attaches through the use of the “H-pattern” which binds at both the deck and bottom of the board fiberglass to the plug which provide the most strength at the fin without permanent installation through glassing on (same as laying on fiberglass). A version of FCS (Fusion) had been designed to {{be installed}} before the surfboard blank is covered with fiberglass and is the preferred version of FCS for epoxy surfboards.|$|R

50|$|In this genus of tree frogs, {{eggs are}} {{deposited}} on a leaf surface, interspersed with hydrating jelly capsules. During the mating process, the frogs fold the leaf around their batch of eggs using their limbs, with a jelly plug {{at the bottom}} of the folded leaf to prevent the eggs from falling out. At hatching, the jelly plug is liquified, and the tadpoles drop through the previously <b>plugged</b> <b>hole.</b> These nests are made above water, so the tadpoles drop into a suitable habitat, where they begin their lives as filter feeders.|$|R

50|$|Laser {{technology}} adds useful {{tools to}} improve engine design during engine testing. Lasers sensors using laser Doppler velocimetry with magnifying LDV sensors can record {{the movements of}} gas particles during the entire 2-stroke, 4-stroke or rotary combustion cycle. These spark plug velocimeter (SPV) sensors can be inserted into the spark <b>plug</b> <b>hole</b> of the combustion chamber of the engine. The sensors can be adjusted to all depth levels of the pistons movement - typically ranging from 0 - 50mm.The magnifying LDV sensors will record the velocity {{and direction of the}} movement of gas particles. Engine design can then be optimised with the recorded data and the visualisation of the combustion cycle. The flow and direction of the gas particles can be improved by changing shape and sizes of the chamber, valves, spark plug, injectors and pistons resulting in improved combustion and performance and in reduced emissions.Engine heads with two spark <b>plug</b> <b>holes</b> per cylinder can be used to record the velocity and direction of the movement of gas particles in an engine running under live, firing conditions.SPVs can also be added to the intake and the exhaust to record flow of particles in these areas to further improve engine design.Magnifying LDV sensors have been used in even more extreme situations to measure particle flow in rocket engines.|$|R
