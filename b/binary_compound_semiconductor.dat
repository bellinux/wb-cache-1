40|$|The {{fabrication}} of multi-junction graded bandgap solar cells {{have been successfully}} implemented by electroplating three <b>binary</b> <b>compound</b> <b>semiconductors</b> from II-VI family. The three semiconductor materials grown by electroplating techniques are ZnS, CdS and CdTe thin films. The electrical conductivity type and energy bandgap {{of each of the}} three semiconductors were determined using photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell measurement and UV-Vis spectrophotometry techniques respectively. The PEC cell results show that all the three semiconductor materials have n-type electrical conductivity. These two material characterisation techniques were considered in this paper in order to establish the relevant energy band diagram for device results, analysis and interpretation. Solar cells with the device structure glass/FTO/n-ZnS/n-CdS/n-CdTe/Au were then fabricated and characterised using current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) techniques.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of laser cooling a semiconductor is its typically high index of refraction (greater than 3), which limits efficient light output of the upconverted photon. This issue is addressed with a novel concept of coupling the photon out via a thin, thermally insulating vacuum gap that allows light to pass efficiently by frustrated internal reflection. Although silicon technology is mature and inexpensive, the indirect nature of the bandgap of silicon makes it unsuitable for laser cooling. The material of choice is the <b>binary</b> <b>compound</b> <b>semiconductor</b> GaAs, which can be fabricated with high quality necessary for laser cooling experiments. Moreover, process technology exists that enables a relatively simple fabrication of a thin vacuum gap in this material system. This paper will present an investigation of heat transport and light transmission across a “nanogap ” consisting of a thin epitaxial film supported over a substrate by an array of nanometer-sized posts. The structure is manufactured by crystal growth of a sacrificial Al 0. 98 Ga 0. 02 As layer on a single crystal GaAs substrate. After lithographically defining holes in the Al 0. 98 Ga 0. 02 As layer, the holes are filled with GaAs and a top GaAs layer is deposited. Lateral selective etching of the Al 0. 98 Ga 0. 02 As will create a nanogap between two GaAs layers separated by GaAs posts. We are demonstrating the successful fabrication of various size nanogaps in this material system, {{as well as their}} properties with respect to reduced heat transfer across the gap. We are also presenting data supporting that the interface quality is high enough to allow evanescent tunneling of light at angles otherwise forbidden by total internal reflection. The implications for semiconductor laser cooling will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|DoctorHighly {{luminescent}} CdSe nanocrystals are {{a promising}} fluorophore for various applications {{due to their}} color-tunable bandgap in the visible range. Their luminescent properties are strongly affected by both the size and {{the surface of the}} nanocrystals because of the quntum confinement effect and high surface-to-volume ratio. To reproducibly yield CdSe nanocrystals with desired structure and optical properties, a series of researches has been done on synthesizing CdSe nanocrystals and manipulating the surface by using both colloidal growth and etching techniques. We first developed a reproducible synthesis of CdSe nanocrystals having zinc-blende (ZB) lattice structure by using a non-coordinating solvent system and used the as-prepared ZB CdSe nanocrystals as a substrate for the synthesis of core/shell nanocrystals, such as CdSe/ZnS, CdSe/ZnSe/ZnS, and CdSe/CdS/ZnS. Only two monolayers of shell coverage for each material is enough to enhance the photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiency and achieve ~ 50 % PL efficiency in water from all core/shell nanocrystals after ligand exchange with 3 -mercaptopropionic acid. The coherent epitaxial growth of the zinc-blende shell for core/shell nanocrystals is confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images. The PL spectra obtained at 5 K illustrates the effects of the shell composition on deep-trap emission, which manifestes the role of hole-trapping surface defects. The spectral shift in both the first absorption maximum and PL band varies with the shell composition following the simple band-offset picture. The shell-to-shell variation of the spectral shift and changes in XRD patterns suggests that the contraction of CdSe lattice occurs with the concomitant redshift in the PL band, most notably with the ZnS shell. Water-soluble nanocrystals shows longer PL lifetimes than organic-soluble ones. As results, the zinc-blende structure is considered a viable alternate replacing the wurtzite structure for the uniform growth of shells and the isotropic incorporation of capping ligands. Then, we studied the effects of two of most important surface capping ligands, primary amine and tertiary phosphine, on the surface trap states of CdSe nanocrystals. It was found that binary amine&# 8211 phosphine ligand system effectively passivates the surface trap states for both electron and hole, thereby making highly luminescent CdSe nanocrystals. Propylamine (PA) and tributylphoshpine (TBP) was added to the nanocrystal solution in chloroform at room temperature. Before the passivation, as-prepared CdSe nanocrystals was mostly covered with fatty acid carboxylates and showed low QE with a multi-exponential PL decay. Addition of excess PA induces blueshifts in both absorption and emission spectra with a slight increase in quantum efficiency and PL lifetime, whereas that of TBP reduces the PL intensity. Surprisingly, addition of both PA and TBP made nanocrystals highly luminescent with a ~ 50 % quantum efficiency and a nearly single-exponential PL decay. The characterization of the nanocrystal surface and the chemical species dissolved into the solution after amine&# 8211 phosphine passivation was carried out by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The XPS analysis shows that fatty acid carboxylates are covered on the surface of as-prepared nanocrystals and both amine and phosphine removes carboxylates from the surface. The ESI mass spectra identifies the chemical species dissolved into the solvent by ligand. As results, it was suggested that primary amine and tertiary phosphine dissolve surface adatoms into the solution and cooperatively passivate surface dangling bonds on CdSe nanocrystals, thereby reproducibly yielding bright CdSe nanocrystals. Lastly, we developed two different etching techniques of CdSe nanocrystals. Each of the two ligands in binary passivation, primary amine and tertiary phosphine, could etch the nanocrystals in their unique ways: tertiary phosphines assisted the oxidative etching of CdSe nanocrystals by oxygen and primary amines induced anodic decomposition of the nanocrystals in chloroform under continuous UV irradiation. In phosphine-assisted oxidative etching, exposing the CdSe nanocrystal solution in chloroform with excess amount of TBP under oxygen induced a continuous blueshift in the absorption spectra. The measurement of the TBP oxidation rate showed that the nanocrystals facilitated the oxidation of TBP while they were continuously etched. Moreover, XPS measurement of the Cd/Se atomic stoichiometry confirmed that the oxidative etching yielded highly Cd-rich surface. Taken together, it was suggested that TBP absorbed on the surface selenium sites assisted the oxidative etching of selenium atoms. MS analysis of the etching product shows that selenium is oxidized from Se 2 &# 8722 to Se 0 by the etching process and Cd 2 + ions ejected from the nanocrystls are stabilized by either chloride ions (Cl&# 8722) produced from the chloroform solvent or oxidation products of TBP such as TBP oxide. In amine&# 8211 UV etching, CdSe nanocrystals passivated with PA in chloroform showed continuous size reduction under UV irradiation. The etching was quenched by either exchanging the solvent to hexane that could not accept electrons like chloroform or adding TBP that could passivate the surface hole traps on the nanocrystals, stongly indicating that the nanocrystals undergo anodic decomposition. The etched CdSe nanocrystals passivated with binary passivation shows high QE which is comparable to that of the nanocrystals prepared by colloidal growth, suggesting that primary amine&# 8211 UV etching can reduce the size of nanocrystals without significantly altering the surface states. XPS analysis showed that the amine&# 8211 UV etching process yielded nearly one-to-one Cd/Se stoichiometry. MS analysis of the etching product show that selenium is oxidized to Se 0 {{as in the case of}} tertiary phosphine&# 8211 oxygen etching and the Cd 2 + ions are mostly stabilized by Cl&# 8722 from the solvent. As results, we could reproducibly and finely control the size of CdSe nanocrystals and manipulate their surface stoichiometry by using different etching techniques. These etching processes are broadly applicable to other <b>binary</b> <b>compound</b> <b>semiconductor</b> nanocrystals and nanomaterials. 고발광성 CdSe 나노결정은 가시광선 전 영역에서 형광 파장이 조절되는 매우 유용한 발광체로서 재료, 전자, 물리, 생화학, 그리고 에너지 공학 영역에서 흡/발광체로 응용되고 있다. 나노미터 크기의 물질에서 나타나는 양자가둠효과와 높은 표면 대 부피 비율로 인해 나노결정의 발광성은 결정의 모양과 표면 상태에 따라 크게 달라진다. 때문에 CdSe 나노결정의 발광성을 재현적으로 조절하기 위해서는 원하는 구조의 나노결정을 재현적으로 합성하는 기술 뿐 아니라 합성된 나노결정의 표면을 제어하는 기술이 필요하다. 본 논문은 CdSe 나노결정의 구조와 표면을 조절하고 그것이 나노결정 발광성에 미치는 영향을 자세히 살펴본 일련의 연구 결과를 소개하고 있다. 특히, 기존의 성장법 위주의 나노결정 합성 뿐 아니라 제어 가능한 나노결정 식각법을 개발하여 나노결정의 구조와 표면 상태를 더욱 다양하고 정밀하게 조절하였다. 먼저, 제 2 장에서 CdSe 나노결정의 구조를 다양화하기 위해 기존의 wurtzite 결정 구조의 CdSe에 대응되는 zinc-blende 결정구조의 CdSe 나노결정을 합성하고 그 특성을 살펴보았다. Non-coordinating 용매 조건에서 재현적으로 zinc-blende CdSe 나노결정을 합성하였고, 이를 기반으로 CdSe/ZnS, CdSe/ZnSe/ZnS, 그리고 CdSe/CdS/ZnS 형태의zinc-blende 핵/껍질 구조 나노결정을 합성하였다. 이들 핵/껍질 구조 나노결정은 모든 조성에서 단 2 monolayer 두께의 껍질 성장만으로 높은 발광성 향상을 보였고 3 -mercaptopropionic acid를 이용한 표면 치환 및 수용성 나노결정 제조 이후에도 ~ 50 % 의 높은 발광수율을 보여주었다. X선 회절패턴과 전자현미경 사진을 통한 구조 분석 결과 모든 핵/껍질 구조 나노결정에서 껍질 물질이 잘 정렬된 epitaxial 성장을 일으켰음을 확인하였다. 뿐만 아니라, 5 K 저온에서의 형광 측정 결과로부터 핵/껍질 구조 나노결정에 표면 결함으로부터 기인하는 hole트랩이 남아 deep-trap 발광을 일으킴을 확인하였다. 껍질 성장에 따른 band-edge 흡수 및 발광 파장의 이동과 X선 회절 패턴 변화는 핵/껍질 구조 나노결정의 띠구조 변화가 단순한 band-offset 도식과 잘 일치함을 보여주었을 뿐 아니라 껍질 성장으로 인한CdSe 핵의 격자 수축이 스펙트럼의 적색편이를 수반함을 제시하였다. 수용성 나노결정으로의 표면 및 용매 치환 결과 나노결정의 발광 수명은 조금 늘어났다. 이상의 연구 결과 zinc-blende CdSe 나노결정이 기존의 wurtzite CdSe 나노결정을 대치할 수 있는 효과적인 발광체임을 확인하였다. 제 3 장에서는 나노결정 표면 상태 및 리간드가 발광성에 미치는 영향에 관한 체계적인 연구 결과를 논의하였다. CdSe 나노결정 합성에서 가장 대표적인 두 리간드인 1 차 아민과 3 차 포스핀이 CdSe 나노결정의 표면 트랩에 미치는 영향을 살펴보았다. 그 결과 두 리간드를 함께 사용한 binary amine-phosphine 패시베이션이 매우 효과적으로 표면의 electron 트랩과 hole 트랩을 제거함을 확인하였다. 상온의 클로로포름에 녹인 CdSe 나노결정 용액에 propylamine과 tributylphosphine을 더하며 발광성 변화를 살펴보았다. 어떤 리간드도 더하기 전 약한 발광과 mult-exponential 발광 쇠퇴를 보여주던 CdSe 나노결정은 과량의 propylamine이 더해지자 흡/발광 파장의 청색편이와 함께 약간의 발광수율 및 발광수명의 향상을 보였으며 tributylphosphine이 더해지자 형광의 감소를 보였다. 그러나 놀랍게도 propylamine과 tributylphosphine이 함께 더해지자 ~ 50 %의 높은 발광 수율과 함께 single-exponential에 가까운 발광쇠퇴를 보여주었다. X선 광전자분광학과 질량분석 기법을 이용하여 amine-phosphine 패시베이션으로 인한 나노결정 표면 상태 변화와 표면에서 용매로 녹아나간 성분을 분석한 결과, 최초 나노결정 표면에 붙어있던 carboxylate가 propylamine과 tributylphosphine에 의해 제거됨을 확인하였다. 이상의 결과들은 1 차 아민과 3 차 포스핀이 나노결정 표면의 adatom들을 용매로 녹여내고 둘이 함께 표면의 electron과 hole 트랩을 효과적으로 패시베이션하여 매우 재현적인 표면 상태와 높은 발광효율을 얻을 수 있었음을 보여주었다. 끝으로, 제 4 장에서 나노결정의 구조 및 표면 제에 기법을 향상시키기 위해 두 가지 새로운 식각법을 소개하였다. 흥미롭게도 제 3 장의 binary 패시베이션에 쓰인 두 리간드가 각각 독특한 화학 과정을 통해 CdSe 나노결정을 분해함을 관찰하였고 이들이 매우 재현적인 나노결정 식각법으로 쓰일 수 있음을 확인하였다. 우선, 3 차 포스핀에 의해 촉진되는CdSe 나노결정의 산화 식각을 확인하였다. 과량의 tributylphosphine이 더해진 CdSe 나노결정의 클로로포름 용액을 산소에 노출시키자 나노결정이 빠르게 분해되기 시작했다. 단지 tributylphosphine 또는 산소만으로는 이와 같은 분해과정이 일어나지 않으며 tributylphosphine의 산화가 나노결정에 의해 촉진됨을 확인하였다. 뿐만 아니라, X선 광전자분광학 분석을 통해 식각 과정이 나노결정 표면의 Cd/Se 원소 비율을 매우 증가시킴을 확인하였다. 이상의 결과는 식각 반응이 나노결정 표면의 Se에 결합된 3 차 포스핀이 산소에 의한 표면 Se의 산화를 촉진시킴을 의미한다. 질량분석을 이용한 식각 생성물 분석 결과 CdSe 의 Se 2 - 가 Se 0 으로 산화되었고, 이 과정에서 방출된 Cd 2 + 이온은 클로로포름 용매에서 나온 염화 이온이나 tributylphosphine oxide와 같은 tributylphosphine의 산화물 등에 의해 용매 속에서 안정화되었음을 확인하였다. 다음으로, 과량의 1 차 아민으로 패시베이션된 CdSe 나노결정이 chloroform 용매 속에서 자외선에 노출되었을 때 매우 빠른 속도로 분해되는 현상을 관찰하였다. 뿐만 아니라, 아민-UV에 의한 식각은 용매를 전자 친화도가 현저히 낮은 hexane으로 치환하거나 나노결정 표면의 hole trap을 제거할 수 있는 tributylphosphine 을 첨가하여 억제할 수 있었다. 이를 통해 식각 과정이 anodic decomposition 과정임을 알 수 있었다. 특히, 식각 이후 얻어진 나노결정 표면을 binary 패시베이션 하자 성장법을 통해 제조한 같은 크기의 CdSe 나노결정과 비슷한 수준의 밝은 발광을 보여주었다. 이는 amine-UV에 의한 식각 과정이 나노결정 표면 상태를 크게 변화시키지 않으면서 크기를 손쉽게 줄일 수 있는 매우 효과적인 방법임을 의미한다. X선 광전자 분광학 분석 결과, 아민-UV 식각을 통해 거의 1 : 1 의 Cd/Se 원소 비율의 나노결정이 얻어짐을 확인하였다. 질량분석을 이용한 식각 생성물 분석 결과 3 차 포스핀-산소 시각에서와 유사하게 Se 0 로 셀레늄이 산화되었고 이 과정에서 떨어져 나온 Cd 2 +는 용매에 의해 염화 카드뮴 형태로 용매 속에 녹아있음을 확인하였다. 이상의 결과들은 위의 식각 방법들이 나노결정의 크기 뿐만 아니라 표면 조성을 재현적이고 정밀하게 조절할 수 있음을 의미한다. 이러한 식각 방법은 다른 이원소 반도체 나노결정에도 적용될 수 있을 것이다...|$|E
