5|$|In response, the United Nations {{began to}} pass a series of resolutions {{demanding}} the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Afraid that Saudi Arabia would be invaded next, the Saudi government requested immediate military aid. As a result, the United States began marshalling forces {{from a variety of}} nations, styled the Coalition, on the Arabian peninsula. Initially, Saddam Hussein attempted to deter Coalition military action by threatening Kuwait's and Iraq's petroleum production and export. In December 1990, Iraq experimented with the use of explosives to destroy wellheads {{in the area of the}} Ahmadi loading complex, developing their capability to destroy Kuwait's petroleum infrastructure on a large scale. On 16 January, Iraqi artillery destroyed an oil storage tank in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, and on 19 January the pumps at the Ahmadi loading complex were opened, pouring crude oil into the Persian Gulf. The oil flowed into the sea at a rate of 200,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> becoming one of the worst ecological disasters to that date.|$|E
5|$|Mired in {{economic}} problems, Cuba was {{aided by the}} election of socialist and anti-imperialist Hugo Chávez to the Venezuelan Presidency in 1999. Castro and Chávez developed a close friendship, with the former acting as a mentor and father-figure to the latter, and together they built an alliance that had repercussions throughout Latin America. In 2000, they signed an agreement through which Cuba would send 20,000 medics to Venezuela, in return receiving 53,000 barrels of oil per day at preferential rates; in 2004, this trade was stepped up, with Cuba sending 40,000 medics and Venezuela providing 90,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> That same year, Castro initiated Misión Milagro, a joint medical project which aimed to provide free eye operations on 300,000 individuals from each nation. The alliance boosted the Cuban economy, and in May 2005 Castro doubled the minimum wage for 1.6 million workers, raised pensions, and delivered new kitchen appliances to Cuba's poorest residents. Some economic problems remained; in 2004, Castro shut down 118 factories, including steel plants, sugar mills and paper processors to compensate for a critical shortage of fuel.|$|E

5000|$|In time, the well's {{pressure}} subsided, {{requiring that}} the oil be pumped out of the well. The first pump was a two-cylinder gasoline-powered pump, later replaced by an electric drive. With the reduction in pressure the well was modified for secondary recovery, using an early form of hydraulic fracturing called [...] "sand fracturing." [...] As of 1980 it produced about <b>a</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> pumping four hours <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Oil came from three layers: the Layton layer at 170 ft, the Wheeler layer at 2300 ft, and the Bartlesville layer at 2700 ft. A 2 in pipeline connects the well to an oil-water separating unit about 2500 ft away, then to storage tanks. The well {{is located in a}} small clearing about 1000 ft west of Drumright. The well was still producing in 2012.|$|R
25|$|In December 2012 Sasol {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} 96,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> plant in Westlake, Louisiana using natural gas from tight shale formations in Louisiana and Texas as feedstock. Costs are estimated to be between 11 and 12 billion dollars with $2 billion in tax relief being contributed by the state of Louisiana. The planned complex will include a refinery and a chemical plant.|$|E
25|$|PetroSA, a South African company which, {{in a joint}} venture, won project {{innovation}} of {{the year}} award at the Petroleum Economist Awards in 2008, has the world's largest Gas to Liquids complexes at Mossel Bay in South Africa. The refinery is a 36,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> plant that completed semi-commercial demonstration in 2011, paving the way to begin commercial preparation. The technology can be used to convert natural gas, biomass or coal into synthetic fuels.|$|E
25|$|In 1947 an {{even bigger}} field opened at Leduc, 20 miles (32km) south of Edmonton, and in 1948 oil mining began at Redwater. Both these fields were overshadowed in {{importance}} in 1956 {{with the discovery of}} the Pembina field west of Edmonton. Other fields were discovered east of Grande Prairie and in central Alberta. From collection and distribution points near Edmonton the oil is sent by pipeline to refineries, some as distant as Sarnia, Toronto and Montreal to the east, Vancouver to the west, and especially the U.S. to the South. Interprovincial Pipe Line (IPL) began in 1949, transporting oil to refineries in the east. IPL became Enbridge Pipelines in 1998 and now has 4500 employees; it moves 2 million <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> over 13,500 miles of pipe.|$|E

25|$|Some {{critics of}} Western {{military}} intervention suggested that resources—not democratic or humanitarian concerns—were the real {{impetus for the}} intervention, among them a journalist of London Arab nationalist newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi, the Russian TV network RT and the (then-)leaders of Venezuela and Zimbabwe, Hugo Chávez and Robert Mugabe. Gaddafi's Libya, despite its relatively small population, was known to possess vast resources, particularly {{in the form of}} oil reserves and financial capital. Libya is a member of OPEC and one of the world's largest oil producers. It was producing roughly 1.6 million <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> before the war, nearly 70 percent of them through the state-owned National Oil Corporation. Additionally, the country's sovereign wealth fund, the Libyan Investment Authority, was {{one of the largest in}} the world, controlling assets worth approximately US$56 billion, including over 100 tons of gold reserves in the Central Bank of Libya.|$|E
500|$|Although Burnham {{had lived}} {{all over the}} world, {{he never had a}} great deal of wealth to show for his efforts. It was not until he {{returned}} to California, the place of his youth, that he found great affluence. In November 1923, he struck oil in Dominguez Hills, near Carson, California. In a field that covered just two square miles, over 150 wells from Union Oil were soon producing 37,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> with 10,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> going to the Burnham Exploration Company, a syndicate formed in 1919 between Frederick Burnham, his son Roderick, John Hayes Hammond, and his son Harris Hammond. In the first 10 years of operation, the Burnham Exploration Company paid out $10.2 million in dividends. The spot where Burnham found oil was land where [...] "as a small boy he used to graze cattle, and shoot game which he sold to the neighboring mining districts to support his widowed mother and infant brother." [...] Many years after the oil was depleted, the land near the Dominguez field was re-developed and became the site of the California State University, Dominguez Hills. In 2010, Occidental Petroleum Corporation expressed interest in redeveloping the former Dominguez oil field using modern extraction technologies.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{up on the}} {{positive}} results of the A-52 well, Shell drilled a discovery well at Panuke, [...] southwest of Cohasset. The Shell Panuke B-90 wildcat encountered a relatively thin zone that tested light oil {{at a rate of}} 1,000 m³ (8,648 barrels) per day. The following year, Petro-Canada drilled the F-99 delineation well at Panuke. That well tested oil at 8,000 m³ (69,188 <b>barrels)</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> for six days.|$|E
5000|$|The {{final step}} in the {{extension}} of the business of the firm was the construction of the huge Pillsbury [...] "A" [...] Mill. In preparation for this expansion, Pillsbury had observed flour mills in Europe, including those of Budapest, Hungary, which had the reputation of production of the finest flour in the [...] "old world". The Pillsbury [...] "A" [...] Mill, built in 1882, was the pride of the firm, with a capacity of 5,000 <b>barrels</b> of flour <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> later increased to 10,000 barrels.

6000|$|Twenty {{years ago}} Mr. Richmond had become possessed of Tom Sawyer's cave {{in the hills}} three miles from town, and had made a tourist-resort of it. In 1849 when the gold-seekers were {{streaming}} through our little town of Hannibal, many of our grown men got the gold fever, and I think that all the boys had it. On the Saturday holidays in summer-time we used to borrow skiffs whose owners were not present and go down the river three miles to the cave hollow (Missourian for [...] "valley"), and there we staked out claims and pretended to dig gold, panning out half {{a dollar a day}} at first; two or three times as much, later, and by and by whole fortunes, as our imaginations became inured to the work. Stupid and unprophetic lads! We were doing this in play and never suspecting. Why, that cave hollow and all the adjacent hills were made of gold! But we did not know it. We took it for dirt. We left its rich secret in its own peaceful possession and grew up in poverty and went wandering about the world struggling for bread--and this because we had not the gift of prophecy. That region was all dirt and rocks to us, yet all it needed was to be ground up and scientifically handled and it was gold. That is to say, the whole region was a cement-mine--and they make the finest kind of Portland cement there now, five thousand <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> with a plant that cost $2,000,000.|$|E
