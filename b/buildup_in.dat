5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the USSR {{had built up}} a {{military}} arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, the largest peacetime defense <b>buildup</b> <b>in</b> United States history.|$|E

40|$|Rudist buildups are {{important}} reservoirs in many Cretaceous {{fields in the}} Middle East, but they are generally near or below seismic resolution. The dimension, shape, and architecture of rudist buildups can be assessed using outcrop, although only partly so because of pseudo- 2 D observations of geobodies intersecting with the out-crop. We used ground-penetrating radar to enhance {{our understanding of the}} shape, dimension, and architecture of Albian rudist <b>buildups</b> <b>in</b> two outcrops in Texas. In the Lake Georgetown spillway, caprinid rudist buildups are 10 – 30 mwide and 2 – 7 m high. They are elliptical with an aspect ratio of as much as 1. 7. They show no or very little flank development. The older <b>buildup</b> exposed <b>in</b> the Red Bluff Creek area displays 10 - to 25 -m-wide and 5 - to 10 -m-high in situ caprinid rudist mound core accumulations with as much as 100 -m-wide reworked flanks in the shallower part of the depositional profile. Downdip along the depositional profile, caprinid buildups are 5 – 20 m wide and 3 – 7 m high with no flank debris. The <b>buildups</b> <b>in</b> the Lake Georgetown area have similar architecture and comparable size with the downdip <b>buildups</b> exposed <b>in</b> Red Bluff Creek. These buildups were compared with other outcropping Albian <b>buildups</b> <b>in</b> Texas that have different sizes, shapes, and stratigraphic architecture to provide dimensional data {{that could be used in}} subsurface reservoir modeling, either for calibrating vario-gram ranges or to build training images. The rudist <b>buildups</b> exposed <b>in</b> Texas are an order of magnitude smaller than those present in the subsurface in the Middle East, but they have comparable stratigraphic architecture. The size difference might be the result of subsurface buildups being mapped using well-log or core correlations or seismic extractions that cannot resolved at that scale of heterogeneity...|$|R
5|$|In 1938, Chamberlin became Assistant Chief of the Construction Branch in the G-4 Division of War Department General Staff.

5|$|In 1991, the amyloid {{hypothesis}} {{postulated that}} extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits are the fundamental {{cause of the}} disease. Support for this postulate comes from {{the location of the}} gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21, together with the fact that people with trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit at least the earliest symptoms of AD by 40years of age. Also, a specific isoform of apolipoprotein, APOE4, is a major genetic risk factor for AD. While apolipoproteins enhance the breakdown of beta amyloid, some isoforms are not very effective at this task (such as APOE4), leading to excess amyloid <b>buildup</b> <b>in</b> the brain. Further evidence comes from the finding that transgenic mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain pathology with spatial learning deficits.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Carbonate buildups are {{a common}} feature in Mississip-pian {{sections}} worldwide. Yet despite intense study, questions remain about depositional processes that form such structures and their inter-relations, if any, to each other. Carbonate <b>buildups</b> located <b>in</b> silici-clastic basins are particularly understudied and poorly understood. This study focuses on a new exposure of <b>buildups</b> <b>in</b> the siliciclastic-dominated Fort Payne basin (Osagean) of south central Kentucky. It represents a first attempt to combine field and petrographic descrip-tions of facies <b>in</b> the <b>buildup</b> interval of the Fort Payne with the con-cepts of sequence stratigraphy to gain better insight into their depo-sitional histories. The buildup interval is composed of five distinct fa-cies.

For general cases blowing your nose can get rid of the mucus buildup. Though blowing may be a quick-fix solution, it would likely proliferate mucosal production in the sinuses, leading to frequent and higher mucus <b>buildups</b> <b>in</b> the nose. Alternatively, saline nasal sprays and vasoconstrictor nasal sprays may also be used, but may become counterproductive after several days of use, causing rhinitis medicamentosa.|$|R
5|$|In {{preparation}} for its <b>buildup</b> <b>in</b> strength, {{the army had}} to train a large cadre of officers. On 10 June 1917 Middleton was assigned to Fort Myer, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. as the adjutant of a reserve officer training camp. These camps were organized to take civilians {{and turn them into}} officers in ninety days, and as adjutant Middleton was responsible for directing the flow of paperwork for 2,700 officer candidates. By November 1917, his camp graduated its last class of officers, and Middleton requested to join a combat division. His request was granted and on 21 December 1917 he reported to the 4th Division at Camp Greene near Charlotte, North Carolina. Two days later, however, he received new orders to become the commander of a reserve officer training camp in Leon Springs, Texas. Here, he reported as ordered, and stayed until the mission was complete in April 1918. As he was technically on loan from the 4th Division, his request to rejoin that unit was granted, and Middleton was soon on his way to France.|$|E
5|$|When Gifu {{was founded}} in 1889, {{it was a small}} city that {{experienced}} moderate growth as Japan industrialized {{at the beginning of the}} century. During Japan's military <b>buildup</b> <b>in</b> the 1930s, the city became an industrial center and experienced exponential growth. Gifu remained prosperous in the post-war years, until its population started to decline like many Japanese cities in the 1980s and '90s. Though the city has shown a large increase in population in recent years, this trend results largely from the inclusion, for the first time, of the population of Yanaizu, which added about 13,000 people to Gifu's numbers. Foreign residents of the city, who number over 9,000, also factor into this growth. Shortly after this change, however, the city's economic revival strengthened and the population began to show a true increase.|$|E
5|$|Despite its poor {{performance}} {{during most of}} 1942, III./KG 40's ability to attack Allied shipping was improved late in the year. During {{the last months of}} 1942 the unit received 18 C-4 variants of the Fw200 which were fitted with the Lotfe7D bombsight. This sight reduced the Condors' vulnerability to anti-aircraft fire by allowing them to bomb targets from medium altitudes; previously they had only been able to attack accurately from low levels. Several of the unit's Condors were also fitted with surface search radar, which improved their ability to locate Allied ships. In early 1943 it was decided to use these aircraft to renew attacks on convoys travelling to Gibraltar in an attempt to disrupt the Allied <b>buildup</b> <b>in</b> the Mediterranean during the Tunisia Campaign. These attacks began in early March and were conducted off Portugal between Lisbon and Cape St Vincent; this area was beyond the range of Allied fighter aircraft based in Gibraltar, and few escort carriers were available to protect convoys. III./KG 40 sank five merchant ships and damaged another two between March and the start of July, for the loss of at least five Condors. In response, the British began to use de Havilland Mosquito fighters to patrol the Bay of Biscay, deployed four additional squadrons of patrol aircraft to Gibraltar, and embarked signals intelligence teams on board warships in the Bay of Biscay to monitor KG40's radio communications.|$|E

The second part of this project is a preliminary study on organic <b>buildups</b> occurring <b>in</b> the Early Ordovician Garden City Formation in Boss Canyon, Utah. This project found that warm, shallow-water organic buildups of the Early Ordovician were small scale structures that were typically 1 - 3 meters in height and several meters in width, with the length variable depending on location. The organic buildups were biotically relatively simple structures formed by algae, lithistid sponges and Calathium with accessory organisms of brachiopods, cephalopods, trilobites, echinoderms, gastropods, ostracods, algal remains and conodonts. The organic buildups are composed of massive to faintly-laminated mudstone to wackestone to packstone to boundstone. Large in situ organisms are found on the organic buildups, while internally they are found as skeletal components. Rock surrounding the organic buildups includes limestone and shale. Channels dissect the organic buildups and some organic buildups show evidence of subaerial exposure. Formation of the organic buildups was dependent on local conditions. Cold water organic buildups are several meters long and generally less than a meter high. These organic buildups have a calcareous-clay composition. The mound core is composed of clay topped by a carbonate cap and overlain by a hardground surface. Formation of the organic buildups was by dense concentrations of sessile siliceous sponges. Accessory organisms include brachiopods, echinoderms, ostracods, pelmatozoans, bryozoans and conodonts...|$|R
