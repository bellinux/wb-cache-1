None {{of the early}} texts of Hamlet, however, were {{arranged}} this way, and the play's division into acts and scenes derives from a 1676 quarto. Modern editors generally follow this traditional division, <b>but</b> <b>consider</b> it unsatisfactory; for example, after Hamlet drags Polonius's body out of Gertrude's bedchamber, there is an act-break after which the action appears to continue uninterrupted.|$|E

The Akha are closely related to the Hani, <b>but</b> <b>consider</b> themselves a distinct group and often resist being subsumed under that identity. In Thailand, they are classified as one of the six hill tribes, a term used for all of the various tribal peoples who migrated from China and Tibet over the past few centuries and who now inhabit the dense forests on the borders between Thailand, Laos, and Burma. Few Akha in Thailand are citizens and most are registered as aliens. There is an oft cited lack of political or state infrastructure to address Akha, or any other indigenous issues in Thailand.|$|E

[...] Much of the scholarship on the poem has focused on the question of who the speaker and the addressee in the poem are, and whether Charaxos and Larichos are the historical or fictional brothers of Sappho. [...] Others have discussed the place of the Brothers Poem in the corpus of Sappho's poetry, and its links with Greek epic, particularly the homecoming stories told in the Odyssey. [...] The lost initial stanza or stanzas of the poem have also been the subject of scholarly attention, with various reconstructions being put forward.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of May25, in spite of bad weather, a crowd {{gathered}} in the Plaza de la Victoria, as did the militia led by Domingo French and Antonio Beruti. They demanded the recall of the Junta elected the previous day, the final resignation of Cisneros, and {{the appointment of a}} new junta that did not include him. Historian Bartolomé Mitre stated that French and Beruti distributed blue and white ribbons, similar to the modern cockade of Argentina, among those present. Later historians doubt it, <b>but</b> <b>consider</b> it possible that the revolutionaries used distinctive marks of some kind for identification. It was rumored that the Cabildo might reject Cisneros' resignation.

500|$|Knight Lore is {{regarded}} as a seminal work in British gaming history and has been included in multiple lists of top Spectrum games. Critics considered its technical solutions and isometric 3D style a harbinger of future game design. They praised the game's controls and atmosphere of mystery, but noted its difficult gameplay and criticised its sound and occasional graphical slowdown. Knight Lore was the best-selling game of January 1985 and was named 1984 game {{of the year by the}} Golden Joystick Awards and Popular Computing Weekly readers. Though it was not the first isometric 3D video game, Knight Lore popularised the format. When the isometric, flip-screen style fell out of fashion, Knight Lore influence persisted in computer role-playing games. Retrospective reviewers remember the game as the first to offer an exploratory [...] "world" [...] rather than a flat surface, <b>but</b> <b>consider</b> its controls outdated and frustrating in the thirty years since its release.|$|E

Ryan Gregory of the University of Guelph and Niles Elredge of the American Museum of Natural History reviewed the Cell and Creature stages. William Sims Bainbridge, a sociologist from the U.S. National Science Foundation, reviewed the Tribe and Civilization stages. NASA's Miles Smith reviewed the Space Stage. The Science team evaluated Spore on twenty-two subjects. The game's grades ranged from a single A in galactic structure and a B+ in sociology to Fs in mutation, sexual selection, natural selection, genetics, and genetic drift. In addition, Yale evolutionary biologists Thomas Near and Thomas Prum found Spore fun to play and admired its ability {{to get people to}} think about evolutionary questions, <b>but</b> <b>consider</b> the game's evolutionary mechanism to be [...] "severely messed up.". With this noted, study of how players make meaning with the game suggest that the game prompts more sophisticated thinking about evolution than the model the game presents.|$|E
2500|$|While {{speaking}} at the 2017 Conservative Party Conference, Johnson caused upset by remarking that the Libyan city Sirte, which had been the site of sustained conflict between the so-called Islamic State and the Libyan Government of National Accord, could be the new Dubai, adding, [...] "all {{they have to do}} is clear the dead bodies away". Following his remarks several Tory MPs called for his sacking. According to The Economist, as Foreign Secretary Johnson “is ridiculed abroad and disliked in the Foreign Office.” [...] Martin Fletcher fears Johnson is harming British interests abroad Fletcher wrote, [...] "Another former British ambassador, requesting anonymity, called him “the least deserving and least qualified foreign secretary of modern times, who has successfully lived down to all expectations”. A senior European diplomat based in London concurred, saying that Johnson was “not taken seriously as a foreign policy actor” and was damaging British interests. He reckoned that three-fifths of the 27 EU ambassadors in London quite like Johnson <b>but</b> <b>consider</b> him ill-suited to the job, while the remaining two-fifths “positively dislike him”. [...] My interlocutors are, of course, experts in their field and fully paid-up members of the metropolitan elite. (...)

2500|$|Handel's {{probationary}} {{appointment to}} Domkirche expired in March 1703. By July Handel was in Hamburg. Since he left {{no explanation for}} the move biographers have offered their own speculation. Burrows believes that the answer can be found by untangling Mainwaring's confused chronology of the trip to Berlin. Burrows dates this trip to 1702 or 1703 (after his father's death) and concludes that since Handel (through a [...] "friend and relation" [...] at the Berlin court) turned down Frederick's offer to subsidize his musical education in Italy (with the implicit understanding that he would become a court musician on his return), Handel was {{no longer able to}} expect preferment (whether as musician, lawyer or otherwise) within Brandenburg-Prussia. And since he was attracted secular, dramatic music (by meeting the Italians Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti and through the influence of Telemann), Hamburg, a free city with an established opera company, was the logical choice. The question remains, however, why Handel rejected the King's offer, given that Italy was the center of opera. Lang suggests that, influenced by the teachings of Thomasius, Handel's character was such that he was unable to becoming subservient to anyone, even a king. Lang sees Handel as someone who could not accept class distinctions that required him to regard himself as a social inferior. [...] "What Handel craved was personal freedom to raise himself out of his provincial milieu to a life of culture." [...] Burrows notes that like his father, Handel was able to accept royal (and aristocratic) favors <b>but</b> <b>consider</b> himself a court servant. And so given the embarrassed financial condition of his mother, Handel set off for Hamburg to obtain experience while supporting himself.|$|E
