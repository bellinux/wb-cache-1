25|$|Polishing wheels, {{also known}} as <b>buffing</b> <b>wheels</b> or {{polishing}} mops, use a specific electric tool to physically remove tarnish from the surface rather than chemically as with the calcium carbonate slurry or commercial dips.|$|E
25|$|Along with <b>buffing</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{particular}} compounds {{are used}} to help polish the material. Two main types of compounds used for silver and gold surfaces are red and blue compounds. Red, also known as jeweler's rouge, polishes without any cutting action. The blue compound is a dryer compound and is used with a grease-less wheel that also does not cut or scratch the surface.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Buffing</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{also known}} as mops, are either made from cotton or wool cloth and come {{bleached}} or unbleached. Specific types include: [...] sisal, spiral sewn, loose cotton, canton flannel, domet flannel, denim, treated spiral sewn, cushion, treated vented, untreated vented, string buff, finger buff, sisal rope, mushroom, facer, tampered, scrubbing mushroom, hourglass buff, rag, [...] "B", climax, swansdown, airflow, coolair, and bullet.|$|E
25|$|When buffing {{there are}} two types of buffing motions: the cut motion and the color motion. The cut motion is {{designed}} to give a uniform, smooth, semi-bright surface finish. This is achieved by moving the workpiece against the rotation of the <b>buffing</b> <b>wheel,</b> while using medium to hard pressure. The color motion gives a clean, bright, shiny surface finish. This is achieved by moving the workpiece with the rotation of the <b>buffing</b> <b>wheel,</b> while using medium to light pressure.|$|R
500|$|The {{blade profile}} of most CQC-6's is a Japanese chisel ground tantō {{with a single}} bevel or zero-ground blade {{sharpened}} on only one side. [...] Early models have a buffline similar to a hamon found on a Japanese Samurai Sword due to a leather <b>buffing</b> <b>wheel</b> used by Emerson to finish his blades. [...] Unlike the typical Japanese chisel-grind, Emerson's grind is on the left-side of the blade {{as opposed to the}} right-side.|$|R

5000|$|A {{wire brush}} wheel or <b>buffing</b> <b>wheels</b> can be interchanged with the {{grinding}} wheels {{in order to}} clean or polish workpieces. Stiff <b>buffing</b> <b>wheels</b> {{can also be used}} when deburring is the task at hand. Some buffing machines (buffers) are built on the same concept as bench grinders except for longer housings and arbors with <b>buffing</b> <b>wheels</b> instead of grinding wheels.|$|E

Today, the company staff works out of a distribution and headquarters facility in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, mailing millions of full-color catalogs annually, and running the Eastwood.com e-commerce website.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{manufacturers}} {{have started to}} use various types of woods to make frames for sunglasses. Materials such as bamboo, ebony, rosewood, pear wood, walnut and zebrawood, are used making them non-toxic and nearly allergy free. The construction of a wooden frame involves laser-cutting from planks of wood. Already cut and ground to a uniform size, a <b>buffing</b> <b>wheel</b> is used to sand and buff every piece separately before they are assembled. The laser-cutouts of wood are then glued together by hand (mostly), layer on layer, to produce wooden frames. Some brands have experimented with recycled wood from objects like skateboards, whiskey barrels and baseball bats. Shwood, for example have experimented with these materials, they have even used recycled newspaper to manufacture frames.|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{lapidary}} {{work is done}} using motorized equipment. Polishing is {{done with}} resin or metal bonded emery, silicon carbide (carborundum), aluminium oxide (corundum) or diamond dust in successively decreasing particle sizes until a polish is achieved. In older systems the grinding and polishing powders were applied separately to the grinding or <b>buffing</b> <b>wheel.</b> Often, the final polish will use a different medium, such as tin oxide or cerium(IV) oxide. Cutting of harder stones is done with a diamond tipped saw. For softer materials silicon carbide, garnet (emery) or corundum {{can be used in}} place of the diamond. Diamond cutting, because of the extreme hardness of diamonds, requires the use of diamond tools. The cutting, grinding and polishing operations are usually lubricated with water, oil, or other liquids.|$|R

5000|$|The third type of mandrel {{discussed}} {{here is that}} {{which is used to}} hold circular saw blades, <b>buffing</b> <b>wheels</b> (used for polishing), and sanding discs onto drills, circular saws, and similar power tools. A mandrel of this type generally consists of a cylinder, threaded on one end, with a washer brazed onto the threaded end and an accompanying screw and second washer used to clamp the circular saw blade, sanding media, or other rotary tool onto the mandrel.|$|E

2500|$|The {{condition}} of the material at hand determines what type of abrasive will be applied. The first stage, if the material is unfinished, starts with a rough abrasive (perhaps 60 or 80 grit) and each subsequent stage uses a finer abrasive, such as 120, 180, 220/240, 320, 400 and higher grit abrasives, until the desired finish is achieved. The rough (i.e. large grit) passes remove imperfections within the metal surface like pits, nicks, lines and scratches. The finer abrasives leave progressively finer lines that are not {{visible to the naked}} eye. To achieve a #8 Finish (Mirror) it requires polishing and <b>buffing</b> compounds, polishing <b>wheels</b> and high speed polishing machines or other machine tools {{that can be used for}} polishing, like an electrical drill. Lubricants like wax and kerosene may be used as lubricating and cooling media during these operations, although some polishing materials are specifically designed to be used [...] "dry." [...] Buffing may be done by hand with a stationary polisher or die grinder, or it may be automated using specialized equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hospital}} was opened in November 1902 by the Hospitals Committee of Sheffield Corporation as a facility {{for the treatment}} of smallpox, it consisted of two 21-bed wards, an eight bedded isolation block, administration building and a building for disinfecting and laundering garments. Prior to World War I almost all admissions were smallpox cases. However, a successful vaccination programme saw the number of patients drop significantly as the disease was almost eradicated. This led to Crimicar Lane admitting increasing numbers of tuberculosis and silicosis cases, many of which were connected with Sheffield’s cutlery industry, which used grindstones and <b>buffing</b> <b>wheels</b> for polishing, creating a large amount of gritty dust which caused respiratory diseases.|$|E
