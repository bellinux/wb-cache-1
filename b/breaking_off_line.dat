50|$|Disturbed by {{plantation}} raiding, {{the colonial}} authorities of Jamaica wanted {{to eradicate the}} maroon communities {{in order to promote}} British settlement. Their strategy, beginning in the 1730s, was to <b>break</b> <b>off</b> <b>lines</b> of communication between the Windward and Leeward Maroons, then first pick off the less organized Windward Maroons. In practice, the Maroon troops’ command of the territory and skill in guerrilla warfare gave them a strong advantage over colonial forces.|$|R

He had reached the summit of his endeavor (l. 191) and yet knew himself powerless to give the King new life. Then there flashed upon him the truth expressed in stanzas XVII-XIX. He <b>breaks</b> <b>off</b> in <b>lines</b> 192-205, going, in his strong feeling, ahead of his story and commenting on what is described in stanza XIX. In stanza XV he resumes his narrative.|$|R
5000|$|The insurgents were demoralised by {{the bitter}} split between Stalin and Tito. [...] In June 1948, the Soviet Union and its {{satellites}} broke off relations with Tito. In {{one of the}} meetings held in the Kremlin with Yugoslav representatives, during the Soviet-Yugoslav crisis, Stalin stated his unqualified opposition to the [...] "Greek uprising". Stalin explained to the Yugoslav delegation that the situation in Greece has always been {{different from the one}} in Yugoslavia because the US and Britain would [...] "never permit Greece to <b>break</b> <b>off</b> their <b>lines</b> of communication in the Mediterranean". (Stalin used the word svernut, Russian for [...] "fold up", to express what the Greek Communists should do.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Geoffrey Chaucer presumably never {{finished}} [...] "The Cook's Tale" [...] and it <b>breaks</b> <b>off</b> after 58 <b>lines,</b> although some {{scholars argue that}} Chaucer deliberately left the tale unfinished. The story starts telling of an apprentice named Perkyn (a.k.a. Perkin) who is fond of drinking and dancing. Perkyn is released by his master and moves in with a friend who also loves to drink, and whose wife a shopkeeper whose real occupation {{is that of a}} prostitute.|$|R
50|$|There {{follows a}} lengthy debate between Wynnere and Wastoure, each giving complex {{arguments}} {{against the other}} and about the effects on society of the principles they represent. At the end, the King gives his judgement, though the poem <b>breaks</b> <b>off,</b> at <b>line</b> 503, before this has been completed. He appears to endorse elements of both Wynnere's sparing and Wastoure's spending, though ultimately the poem seems to condemn both viewpoints as unbalanced, selfish, and leading to inequality and social abuses. It {{seems likely that the}} poem forms a sophisticated comment on the pressures facing the king and on the principles of good governance, with additional satire directed against the rising merchant class in the person of Wynnere. Though his subject is the feudal economy, the poet's themes are essentially moralistic.|$|R
50|$|The two {{versions}} of Soul and Body are found in two separate poetry collections. The first {{is found in the}} Vercelli manuscript, and is entitled, by modern scholars, Soul and Body I. The other is found in the Exeter manuscript, and is entitled, also by modern scholars, Soul and Body II. Soul and Body I differs from the Exeter version, in that, following the damned souls address is a parallel address from a blessed soul to its body. Soul and Body II ends after The Damned Souls address, which consists of 126 lines of verse. Soul and Body I, however, continues with what remains of The Blessed Souls address, another 40 lines of verse. The Vercelli manuscript seems to be missing several pages and, as a result, The Blessed Souls address <b>breaks</b> <b>off</b> at <b>line</b> 166 with the word þisses.|$|R
5000|$|This species' showy flowers led to {{its being}} used as a parent in a spate of {{hybridisation}} starting in 1886, and resulting in a multitude of descendants with larger flowers and a wider range of colours. Both S. rexii and its hybrids proved to need little pampering in the gardens of Europe and the United States, making them perennially popular. Their resistance to dry conditions makes them ideal subjects for hanging baskets in greenhouses. As in the sister genus of Saintpaulia, propagation is readily done from leaf cuttings that are best taken in spring and early summer. Any sterile medium may be used provided it is well drained. The tips of the leaves will discolour and <b>break</b> <b>off</b> along abscission <b>lines</b> if stressed by cold or prolonged drought, though overwatering will encourage fungal growth.|$|R
6000|$|I {{changed my}} tactics. When {{a man is}} {{paralleling}} your mental processes, ditch him. Abruptly <b>break</b> <b>off</b> your <b>line</b> of reasoning, and go off on a new line. This I did. I hid between some cars on an adjacent side-track, and watched. Sure enough, that con came back again to the car. He opened the door, he climbed up, he called, he threw coal into the hole I had made. He even crawled over the coal {{and looked into the}} hole. That satisfied him. Five minutes later the freight was pulling out, and he was not in sight. I ran alongside the car, pulled the door open, and climbed in. He never looked for me again, and I rode that coal-car precisely one thousand and twenty-two miles, sleeping most of the time and getting out at divisions (where the freights always stop for an hour or so) to beg my food. And {{at the end of the}} thousand and twenty-two miles I lost that car through a happy incident. I got a [...] "set-down," [...] and the tramp doesn't live who won't miss a train for a set-down any time.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout Ariostos writing are narratorial {{comments}} dubbed by Dr. Daniel Javitch as [...] "Cantus Interruptus". Javitchs term {{refers to}} Ariostos narrative technique to <b>break</b> <b>off</b> one plot <b>line</b> {{in the middle}} of a canto, only to pick it up again in another, often much later, canto. Javitch argues that while many critics have assumed Ariosto does this so as to build narrative tension and keep the reader turning pages, the poet in reality defuses narrative tension because so much time separates the interruption and the resumption. By the time the reader gets to the continuation of the story, he or she has often forgotten or ceased to care about the plot and is usually wrapped up in another plot. Ariosto does this, Javitch argues, to undermine [...] "mans foolish but persistent desire for continuity and completion". Ariosto uses it throughout his works.|$|R
40|$|Efforts {{to perform}} the {{deterministic}} and probabilistic analysis and to improve {{the safety of the}} Ignalina NPP are continuously being increased in Lithuania. Probabilistic safety estimation at the Ignalina NPP shows {{that it is necessary to}} keep on performing risk analysis and to continue improving safety. Technical experiments and calculations in different countries allow an unambiguous conclusion that the main building constructions of the Ignalina NPP would withstand the falling of light planes and can be destroyed by heavy transport or military planes. Crash of a light plane on the Ignalina NPP may damage separate systems important for the safety of the plant (for example, to <b>break</b> <b>off</b> the <b>lines</b> of the external electric system) and cause other accidents. Thus, the modelling of aircraft crash occurrence and its impact on the Ignalina NPP is significant in order to evaluate risk and prevent potential failure of the systems important to safety. In this work, we improve the aircraft crash probability estimation model in order to analyze the importance of the used parameters for the results. The aircraft crash probability on the territory of the NPP with the radius r may be expressed by the derived formula. This formula is used to calculate the aircraft crash probability using the most recent statistical data. As part of the initial conditions and parameters of aircraft crash models are not well-known or have different values for different types of planes, the uncertainty analysis was performed for a new model. The sensitivity analysis determines the parameters that have the greatest influence on the model results. Conclusions about the importance of the parameters and sensitivity of the results are obtained using a linear approximation of the model under analysis...|$|R
5000|$|In October 1938 Boulton {{graduated}} to Trinity College (part of Cambridge University) where he undertook studies of mathematics, logic and the classics. His first tutor in Cambridge was the English mathematician George Peacock (then Cambridges Lowndean Professor of Astronomy {{and a friend}} of Charles Babbage). Among Boultons earliest accomplishments was earning the Eton Prize in February 1839 for his essay, The Decline and Fall of the Persian Empire, and an award for his collection of witty epigrams at Cambridge University in 1841. He also won two of Cambridges Sir William Browne Medals for Latin and Greek poetry. Dr. Chris Upton of Birmhinghams Newman University wrote on Boultons 1841 Latin poem Vehicula vi vaporis impulsa, roughly meaning [...] "Vehicles driven by the power of steam". Describing Boultons poem in an English rendering, Upton wrote: [...] "Devilish" [...] he calls the machine, cutting through the middle of mountains, slicing through the countryside. Faster than a thunderbolt it speeds... until..:"But ah! an axle <b>breaks,</b> and then <b>Off</b> <b>line</b> the train goes crashing With dire destruction, men on men, Noses on noses dashing[...] [...]""Of such mere trifles, who complains?
