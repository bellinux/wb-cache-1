30|$|At present, {{the effects}} of {{tensioning}} on the dynamic stability of the blades have been mainly focused [6 – 16]. The generation of tensioning stress during tensioning processes has been studied by a few researchers. A theoretical model for roll tensioning process was established by Szymani and Mote [2]. A model for roll tensioning process was established by Nicoletti based on the finite element method [17]. A finite element model (FEM) for roll tensioning process, which allowed for the investigation of various roll tensioning parameters, was developed by Heisel [18]. A mathematical model of tangential tensioning stress in {{the edge of a}} circular saw <b>blade</b> <b>tensioned</b> by multi-spot pressure was established for the quality control of circular saw blades by Li [19].|$|R

30|$|The multi-spot {{pressure}} tensioning {{process of}} {{circular saw blade}} was built by dynamic/explicit solution module of the finite element software called ABAQUS for avoiding non-convergence and improving the computational efficiency. The stress field of circular saw blade during loading process was calculated based on the finite element model. The model which could both meet the requirement of computational efficiency and accuracy was established by adjusting the step time and density of circular saw blade. The unloading process of circular saw blade was built by static/general solution module of ABAQUS using the stress field of loading process calculated by dynamic/explicit finite element method as initial conditions. The tangential tensioning stress field of circular saw <b>blade</b> <b>tensioned</b> by multi-spot pressure which showed the same trend with the measured result was calculated based on the two above-mentioned models.

50|$|A hacksaw is a fine-toothed saw, {{originally}} and principally {{made for}} cutting metal. They can also cut various other materials, such as plastic and wood; for example, plumbers and electricians often cut plastic pipe and plastic conduit with them. There are hand saw versions and powered versions (power hacksaws). Most hacksaws are hand saws with a C-shaped frame that holds a <b>blade</b> under <b>tension.</b> Such hacksaws have a handle, usually a pistol grip, with pins for attaching a narrow disposable blade. The frames {{may also be}} adjustable to accommodate blades of different sizes. A screw or other mechanism is used to put the thin <b>blade</b> under <b>tension.</b> Panel hacksaws forgo the frame and instead have a sheet metal body; they can cut into a sheet metal panel further than a frame would allow. These saws are no longer commonly available, but hacksaw blade holders enable standard hacksaw blades to be used similarly to a keyhole saw or pad saw. Power tools including nibblers, jigsaws, and angle grinders fitted with metal-cutting blades and discs are now used for longer cuts in sheet metals.|$|R
30|$|The {{material}} {{model of}} {{circular saw blade}} was set as linear strengthening elastic–plastic model (bilinear model) because the plastic deformation of circular saw <b>blade</b> during roll <b>tensioning</b> process was very little.

30|$|In this study, a 2 -D and 3 -D FEM {{model of}} roll {{tensioning}} process {{was established by}} theoretical analysis and calculation. The effects of yield strength of circular saw <b>blade</b> on the <b>tensioning</b> stress distribution and rolling force were studied by these two models.|$|R
30|$|In step 1, {{the roll}} moved slowly down and elastic–plastic {{deformation}} was produced to the saw blade. In step 2, the roll slowly raised and the saw blade {{was no longer}} under any load. The residual stress of saw <b>blade</b> was the <b>tensioning</b> stress.|$|R
30|$|The {{tensioning}} {{stress distribution}} of circular saw <b>blade</b> after roll <b>tensioning</b> {{was described by}} Szymani [2]. In the inner loop of the tensioned region, the tangential tensioning stress is compressive, and its value increases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to inside. In the exterior loop of the tensioned region, the tangential tensioning stress is tensile, and its value decreases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to outside. This distribution of tangential tensioning stress is not very ideal relatively. The tangential tensioning stresses of circular saw <b>blades</b> <b>tensioned</b> by three levels of hammering were measured by X-ray stress meter [3, 4]. The tangential tensioning stress outside hammer region increases with radius, which is an ideal distribution. This phenomenon indicates that the distribution of tangential tensioning stress produced by hammering is more reasonable than that produced by roll tensioning. However, hammer tensioning has its limitations because the hammer tensioning creates a very irregular surface and produce localized, non-axisymmetric stresses because the force and position of spots are controlled by workers and its reproducibility and controllability {{are very difficult to}} be mastered, and it depends heavily on the experience and skills of saw repairing workers. The precision of hammer tensioning is relatively poor. Multi-spot pressure tensioning process is one kind of tensioning methods and a quasi-static process. The fixed areas of circular saw blade are pressed by spherical or cylindrical surface during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. The force and position of spots are controlled precisely by automated machinery during the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. A cyclic symmetry stress distribution and appropriate macroscopic deformation can be obtained by the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. Therefore, a more ideal distribution of tangential tensioning stress is produced during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. This tensioning approach is conducive to the realization of the automatic tensioning operation, especially in the production of ultra-thin circular saw blades.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{aerodynamic}} performance of a semi-flexible membrane blade, fluid–structure interaction simulations have been performed for a non-rotating blade under steady inflow condition. The studied concept blade has a length of about 5  m. It consists of a rigid mast at the leading edge, ribs along the <b>blade,</b> <b>tensioned</b> edge cables at the trailing edge and membranes forming {{the upper and lower}} surface of the blade. Equilibrium shape of membrane structures in the absence of external loading depends on the location of the supports and the prestresses in the membranes and the supporting edge cables. Form-finding analysis is used to find the equilibrium shape. The exact form of a membrane structure for the service conditions depends on the internal forces and also on the external loads, which in turn depend on the actual shape. As a result, two-way coupled fluid–structure interaction (FSI) analysis is necessary to study this class of structures. The fluid problem has been modelled using two different approaches, which are the vortex panel method and the numerical solution of the Navier–Stokes equations. Nonlinear analysis of the structural problem is performed using the finite-element method. The goal of the current study is twofold: first, to make a comparison between the converged FSI results obtained from the two different methods to solve the fluid problem. This investigation is a prerequisite for the development of an efficient and accurate multi-fidelity simulation concept for different design stages of the flexible blade. The second goal is {{to study the}} aerodynamic performance of the membrane blade in terms of lift and drag coefficient as well as lift-to-drag ratio and to compare them with those of the equivalent conventional rigid blade. The blade configuration from the NASA-Ames Phase VI rotor is taken as the baseline rigid-blade configuration.

Models of saws have been found in many contexts throughout Egyptian history. Particularly useful are tomb wall illustrations of carpenters at work that show sizes and the use of different types. Egyptian saws were at first serrated, hardened copper which cut on both pull and push strokes. As the saw developed, teeth were raked to cut only on the pull stroke and set with the teeth projecting only on one side, rather than in the modern fashion with an alternating set. Saws were also made of bronze and later iron.

PreComp computes these properties {{with a novel}} approach that integrates a modified classic laminate theory with a shear-flow approach. The computed properties include cross-coupled stiffness properties, inertia properties, and offsets of the <b>blade</b> shear center, <b>tension</b> center, and center of mass {{with respect to the}} blade pitch axis. Analysts need these properties to properly model the major flexible components of a wind turbine—blades, tower, and drivetrain shaft. Almost every aeroelastic code (FAST, ADAMS, BLADED, etc.) requires these properties as inputs. Designers need these properties to rapidly evaluate alternate composite layouts and their effects on blade properties and material strains. Structural properties are difficult to extract from 3 -D finite element models (FEMs), which are primarily suited to obtaining detailed stress and displacement distributions. Such models also take time and effort to develop and are typically used during the final design stage. Salient features of PreComp are accurate computation of blade torsion stiffness and cross-stiffness properties.

40|$|Abstract Circular {{saw blades}} are very {{widespread}} in wood machining. They {{are used in}} different batches and sizes and in large quantities from hand tools to large machining centers. Because of this huge range of applications the circular saws have gained great importance in the industry. The rising request to improve the cutting quality, reduce the noise emission and increase the life time requires improvement of the dynamic behavior of the circular saw <b>blade.</b> The roll <b>tensioning</b> of the circular saw blade has been empirically established {{as a solution to}} improve the static and dynamic properties of the circular saw blade. However, there are several influencing parameters for this process that have not yet been studied scientifically accurate. A scientific and economical solution for the study of various roll tensioning parameters is a simulation model based on finite elements method (FEM) that analyzes the effects on the dynamic behavior of circular saw blade. A simulation model for roll tensioning of circular saw blades was developed in this study. With this simulation model, the residual stresses induced by the roll tensioning can be calculated. The induced residual stresses are actually responsible for the changing of dynamic properties of the circular saw blade, such as the shifting of eigenvalues and reduction of side run out. Furthermore, this simulation model allows the investigation of various roll tensioning parameters.

40|$|A {{new method}} of turbine blade cooling, the Return Flow Cascade, has been {{developed}} in which vaporization of a liquid metal such as potassium is used to maintain the blade surface at a nearly uniform temperature. Turbine blades cooled using this technology have lower blade temperature levels compared to that available with conventional air cooling, potentially resulting in higher firing temperatures or a choice of {{a wider range of}} materials for the hot gas path. The detailed operation of the Return Flow Cascade is described including fluid mechanic and heat transfer phenomena that occur at high heat flux and gravitational acceleration levels characteristic of modern gas turbine engines. The performance limits of the Return Flow Cascade are identified by the development of a theoretical model that estimates the performance of the system for a range of operating conditions found in the experimental test rig and in an actual gas turbine engine. These limits include vapor choking in the internal blade passages, pool boiling limits in the <b>blade,</b> and surface <b>tension</b> restriction of liquid flow. Experimental results are presented from testing in the Rotating Heat Transfer Rig at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. An infrared detector capable of high scan rates was used to fully map the temperature distribution of a single, heated, rotating turbine blade. The blade surface temperature maps show that the Return Flow Cascade works as designed by enforcing a nearly constant temperature over the surface of the blade. Cascade initiation limits predicted by the internal vapor choking model are in good agreement with the test data. by Jessica L. Townsend. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|A heliogyro {{spacecraft}} is {{a specific}} type of solar sail that generates thrust from the reflection of solar photons. It consists of multiple long (200 to 600 meters), thin blades, similar to a helicopter. The heliogyro 2 ̆ 7 s <b>blades</b> remain in <b>tension</b> by spinning around the central hub of the spacecraft. The individual blades are pitched collectively or cyclically to produce the desired maneuver profile. The propellant-free heliogyro is a long-duration sustainable spacecraft whose maneuverability allows it to attain previously inaccessible orbits for traditional spacecraft. The blades are constructed from thin Mylar sheets, approximately 2. 5 μm thick, which have very little inherent damping making it necessary to include some other way of attenuating blade vibration caused by maneuvering. The most common approach is to incorporate damping through the root pitch actuator. However, due to the small root pitch control torques required, on the order of 2 μNm, compared to the large friction torques associated with a root pitch actuator, it is challenging to design a root control system that takes friction into account and can still add damping to the blade. The purpose of this research is to address the limitations of current control designs for a heliogyro spacecraft and to develop a physically realizable root pitch controller that effectively damps the torsional structural modes of a single heliogyro blade. Classical control theory in conjunction with impedance control techniques are used to design a position-source root pitch controller to dominate friction with high gains, wrapped with an outer loop that adds damping to the blade by sensing differential twist outboard of the blade root. First, modal parameter characterization experiments were performed on a small-scale heliogyro blade in a high vacuum chamber to determine a how much inherent damping is present in the blade, which drove the selection of the damping constant used in the membrane ladder finite element model of the blade. The experimental damping ratio of the lowest frequency torsional mode is on the order of 0. 005...|$|R
40|$|Within the RIMRES project, a modular {{reconfigurable}} multi-robot {{system is}} being developed, which should demonstrate key technologies {{required for the}} exploration of challenging and difficult planetary terrain, as it is found at the lunar south pole. For this purpose, key technologies {{in the area of}} autonomy, navigation and locomotion are being investigated and hardware engineered with the overall aim of having a system with interchangeable but compatible components, connected via unique mechanical and electrical interfaces. This thesis was written in close collaboration with the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) at the Institute of Space Systems in Bremen and deals with the concept development and design of a flexible metal wheel with an adaptive mechanism for soft planetary soils. The concept presented here builds upon the DLR wheel design developed for the ESA ExoMars mission, which incorporated flexible metal spokes to enlarge the wheels ground contact area. The new wheel design will be equipped with an intelligent sensor system to monitor and characterise soil properties. Dependent upon whether the rover is rolling over a hard or soft soil area, an integrated adaptable stiffness mechanism will then actively adjust the wheels flexibility. Equivalent to the inflation of a rubber tyre, by increasing the stiffness of the wheel the rolling resistance can be minimised when running on hard ground, whilst decreasing the wheels stiffness will maximise the tractive force when running over soft ground. The work of this thesis in particular, deals with the concept development of such an adaptable system. The previous investigated ideas have been analysed in detail leading {{to a better understanding of}} their working principles. Subsequently, a new flexible wheel design was proposed based on the tensioned spoke wheel (bicycle wheel). With the help of computer based finite element analysis the non-linear deformation behaviour of the flexible elements was then evaluated. It has been shown, that the new wheel design, with near-parabolic shaped <b>tension</b> <b>blades,</b> permits large deflections above 10 % of the wheels diameter with low stress levels by maintaining a relatively harmonic oval shape of the wheels tread. Also simulated were cases of high torques and side skid (driving across slopes). In each load case the wheels deformation behaviour was analysed and cross checked from a structural mechanics point of view. The results found with the simulation, achieving the best performance in terms of deflection distance and applied load, were then used to design and construct a new breadboard demonstrator wheel, which is now used for extensive testing at DLR test facilities.

One of thefactor which has an {{important}} influence on mechanicaldewatering, i. e. in both forming and pressing, is thestress-strain behaviour of the fibre network. The focus of this thesis is {{on the development of}} improvedmathematical descriptions of the stress-strain behaviourexhibited by fibre networks in the forming and press sections. The first part of the thesis presents a physically based modelof the forming and densification of fibre mats in twin-wireformers. The model can calculate the ecect of the applicationof a varied load through the forming section. It was developedfrom mass and momentum balances of the fibre and liquid phases,the fibre mat stress-porosity relation and an expression forthe permeability {{as a function of the}} porosity. The fibre-matstress-porosity relation used is rate-independent and presentshysteresis. Simulations have been conducted to study theeffects of roll pressure, <b>blade</b> pulses, wire <b>tension</b> andbeating. The effect of sequential blade pressure pulses afterthe forming roll on the dewatering and the concentrationgradients could be characterised. The simulations alsoexhibited rewetting by expansion when the fibre mats left theforming roll. Increasing wire tension resulted in increaseddewatering, but the rate of increase diminished rapidly withincreasing tension. The simulation results also indicated thatbeating has a large influence on dewatering. The second part of the thesis presents two models of therate-dependent stress-strain behaviour of the fibre networkthat is observed in wet pressing. The first model was based onthe approach pioneered by Perzyna (1966) for strain-ratedependent plasticity and was quite satisfactory for calculatingthe stress-strain behaviour of the fibre network in singlepress nips. It was successfully applied for studyingdensification and dewatering in both normal wet pressing andhigh temperature wet pressing. However, the first model onlyincludes rate dependence in the compression phase of thecompressionexpansion cycle; the expansion phase is treated asbeing rate independent The second model of the stress-strain behaviour of the fibrenetwork treats both compression and expansion as being ratedependent, according to experimental observations. It is basedon the idea that the wet fibre web may be conceived as alayered network of restricted swelling gels. A swollen fibre isa restricted gel, the inner swelling pressure in a swollenfibre wall being balanced by the stresses in the fibre wallstructure. The observed rate dependence of wet webs in bothcompression and expansion phases was attributed to the flow ofwater out of and into the fibre walls. The second model gavepredictions that are in good agreement with results fromuniaxial experiments using pressure pulses of arbitrary shapefor both a single pulse and a sequence of pulses. It maytherefore be used as a general model for the rheologicalbehaviour of the wet fibre network in wet pressing, providedthe model parameters are estimated from experimental data withsmall experimental error.
