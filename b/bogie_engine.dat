50|$|Most diesel and electric, which rest on bogies, can be {{converted}} by replacing those <b>bogies.</b> <b>Engines</b> with fixed wheelbases are problematic.|$|R
50|$|In 1900/01, {{and being}} {{impressed}} with the <b>bogie</b> <b>engines</b> introduced by the Great Southern and Western Railway, the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the MGWR, Martin Atcock, decided on a similar experiment. Six of the 2-4-0s were converted to 4-4-0s, and redesignated D-bogie class. They were originally planned for use on the Mullingar to Sligo mail trains, however they were poor steamers and proved to be underpowered for this work being transferred soon afterwards to the Westport - Achill branch line in western County Mayo — a highly scenic line which passed through {{the small town of}} Newport and the village of Mallaranny before reaching the western seaboard at Achill Sound.|$|R
5000|$|Spare power <b>bogies,</b> {{frames and}} <b>engines</b> for the railcar are {{currently}} in outside storage.|$|R
5000|$|Four <b>bogie</b> <b>engines</b> {{were built}} for the opening which could cope with the steep {{gradients}} and curves. This type of engine was normally used in factories and other confined spaces. Special four wheeled carriages were also built. In 1899 12 locomotives were specially {{built for the}} line. These became known as Balerno Pugs. From 1934 standard tank engines were gradually brought into service replacing the pug engines. Engine number CR419 {{was one of those}} used and is now in the possession of The Scottish Railway Preservation Society having been restored by them in 1971 and again in 2009. Railway enthusiasts were enthralled to see these little trains weaving along in such delightful rural surroundings yet so close to the heart of Edinburgh.|$|R
5000|$|WDS 2: o-C-o <b>bogies.</b> 8 {{cylinder}} <b>engine.</b> Based at Central Railway. Maximum speed 54 km/h. Built by Kraus Maffei in 1954-55[...] 15,420 kgf of {{tractive effort}} ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{was a risk}} of the <b>engine</b> <b>bogies</b> {{swinging}} {{right around}} {{in the event of}} a derailment and safety chains should be fitted to prevent that from happening.|$|R
5000|$|The British did {{not expect}} their light tanks to be used against {{anything}} except other light tanks at most and as such armament was a machine gun only—Vickers machine guns firing either a [...]303 inch or [...]0.5 inch (12.7 mm) round. Suspension was Horstmann coil spring on <b>bogies.</b> The <b>engine</b> was a Meadows 6-cylinder petrol. Up until the Mk V, they were crewed by a driver-commander and gunner. The Mk V had a driver, a gunner and the commander helping on the gun.|$|R
50|$|The {{groundbreaking}} ceremony {{took place}} in March 2005. The depot was constructed on the 10 acre site over 13 months, being completed 3 April 2006, {{at a cost of}} about £30M. The designers were Burks Green; Taylor Woodrow the main contractors; NG Bailey and Atkins Rail subcontractors. The main shed was a 6000 m2 building capable of holding eight trains (a four road shed with two three-23 m-car trains per road.), with facilities including wheel lathe, train jacks, and <b>bogie</b> and <b>engine</b> drops. The depot was officially opened on 16 May 2006 by Transport Secretary Douglas Alexander.|$|R
5000|$|ET41 {{are mainly}} used for coal {{transport}} from Upper Silesia to the ports of Gdańsk, Gdynia and Szczecin. Seldom are those locomotives used for hauling passenger trains. In 2016, PKP Cargo {{decided to send}} some of ET41 locomotives for major repair and modernization to Ostrów Wielkopolski. Electric part, <b>bogies</b> and traction <b>engines</b> were modernized. Driver cabs were rebuild, reducing the noise level in the cab.|$|R
50|$|The {{vertical}} boiler of {{the engine}} was located {{to the rear of}} the front driving compartment and had an outer cylindrical shell and an inner firebox, with the middle portion of the firebox pressed into a square cross-section. The coal bunker and water tank were mounted on the power bogie and the bunker part was separate from the coach body to enable it to swivel with the power <b>bogie.</b> The <b>engine</b> unit had two cylinders with piston valves which drove a spur gear on the driving axle, while the two axles of the power bogie were connected with coupling rods. For bi-directional operation, the railmotor had a second driving cab at the rear end of the coach.|$|R
50|$|A {{design for}} a small {{multi-service}} Bo-Bo locomotive, with speed up to 90 km/h, had been devised by Giuseppe Bianchi as early as in the 1930s, but the project had been halted {{by the introduction of}} the E.326 and E.428. After the realization of the 6-axle E.636, it was however decided to revamp the project by adapting to it some solutions already in use on the E.636 (<b>engines,</b> <b>bogies,</b> suspension etc.).|$|R
50|$|The MMTB {{commenced}} {{operations on}} 1 November 1919, {{taking over the}} cable tram network with 44 route miles of track, 539 grips cars, 485 four wheel trailer cars, 58 double <b>bogie</b> trailers, 11 <b>engine</b> sheds and 15 carriage sheds. On 2 February 1920, it took over the six suburban electric tramway trusts, which were dissolved later that month. The MMTB also succeeded the Cable Tramway Board and the Royal Park Horse Tramway.|$|R
50|$|The {{third and}} newest of the IC3's {{offspring}} is {{specifically designed for}} use in the regional traffic in areas surrounding the Oresund Bridge. The train is operated by both DSB and Veolia Transdev. Its formation is ET-FT-ET. The train is electrically powered, and can run on both Danish power (25 kV, 50 Hz) and Swedish power (15kV, 16 Hz). It is called Contessa by its manufacturer, and designated Litra ET in Denmark and X31K in Sweden. Only the front and the cabin are similar to IC3. The wheels, <b>bogies</b> and <b>engines</b> are more similar to Bombardier Regina and each carriage has two bogies. It is used for the regional cross-border traffic called Øresundståg, and the train type is also often called that, these trains are used for some other traffic also.|$|R
50|$|Current revenue {{operations}} {{are carried out}} in the eastern section of the workshops by Downer Rail, who carry out work including locomotive and carriage maintenance, and diesel <b>engine,</b> <b>bogie</b> and wheelset overhauls; for customers including Pacific National and V/Line. The workshop also has the only broad gauge underfloor wheel lathe in Victoria. From 2018, it will build the High Capacity Metro Trains. A section of the workshops is leased to Siemens for maintenance of their Siemens Nexas trains.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was capable}} of speeds of 57 mph, but it {{was found to be}} unsteady at high speed due to the absence of a leading <b>bogie</b> on each <b>engine</b> unit. It could handle a load of 1245 lt t on 1 in 80 (1¼%) gradients and hauled 340 lt t up the 15 mi of 1 in 40 (2½%) gradient of the Hex River Railpass in sixty-two minutes without the help of the usual banking locomotive.|$|R
50|$|The outside {{frames of}} the Dukes were curved upwards over {{each pair of}} driving wheels. Inner and outer frames were 3/4 in thick. The first 40 {{members of the class}} were fitted with Mansell pattern bogie wheels with wooden centres. The first 25 tenders built also had Mansell pattern wheels, and a shorter than normal {{wheelbase}} of 11 ft so that the locomotives would fit on the smaller turntables then in use west of Newton Abbot. The <b>engine</b> <b>bogie</b> was of a centre-less type designed by Dean.|$|R
5000|$|The initial {{designs of}} the Class GM Garratt were {{rejected}} by the Chief Civil Engineer, however, since the weight on the leading and trailing <b>bogies</b> of each <b>engine</b> unit would exceed the acceptable limit for the [...] rail of the Mafeking line. To overcome the axle load objections, the water capacity of the front water tank was reduced to 1600 imp gal while the rear bunker was redesigned to carry no water and with a coal capacity of 10 lt t. The meagre water supply, which would really only be sufficient for shunting purposes, would be augmented by semi-permanently coupling a purpose-built auxiliary water tender to the locomotive.|$|R
50|$|A {{large number}} of {{locomotive}} classes were used on the Waverley Route, {{many of which were}} not designed for the line. Among the earliest locomotives to be used on the line were Hawthorn double-framed 0-6-0 mineral engines ordered on 28 October 1845 whose principal task was to haul coal on the E&DR. Known as Dalkeith Coal engines, these were spartan machines without weather boards or sideboards to protect the crew against inclement conditions, although whistles were provided, one of which stood against the driver's ear. These were supplemented by eight Hawthorn passenger 2-4-0s in 1847 upon the opening of the Hawick extension. In 1873, Thomas Wheatley, the NBR's Locomotive Superintendent, introduced the 420 class. Four engines were built at Cowlairs railway works which were capable for handling light trains but inadequate for the heavier rolling stock used by the Midland Railway on its Anglo-Scottish expresses once the Settle-Carlisle line opened. A more capable locomotive was introduced in 1875 by Wheatley's successor Dugald Drummond whose 4-4-0 476 class was the largest and most powerful locomotive in Great Britain at the time, as well as {{one of the very few}} satisfactory four-coupled <b>bogie</b> express <b>engines</b> on the network on the 1870s. The new locomotives were known as the Abbotsford Class after no. 479 which bore that name.|$|R
50|$|Various petrol engines were used, an 85 hp Napier {{engine was}} the first to be installed, but these were found unsatisfactory, so were {{replaced}} in 1904 by Wolseley engines. These flat-four engines produced 92 bhp at their normal rated speed of 400rpm, and well over 100 bhp when run at 480rpm. The cylinders were 8.5 inch diameter with 10 inch stroke. The engine had a 3-foot diameter flywheel, and was coupled directly to a Westinghouse multi-polar dynamo. A small dynamo driven by belt from the flywheel provided charge for the accumulators which enabled electric starting of the engine, lighting for the carriage, and the exciting current for the field coils in the main dynamo, controlled by rheostats {{at either end of the}} railcar. The engine speed could likewise be controlled via a throttle from either end of the railcar. The output from the main dynamo was sent to two electric motors, both mounted on the <b>bogie</b> underneath the <b>engine</b> room.|$|R
5000|$|During 1938 and 1939, the SAR placed sixteen Class GM Garratt {{articulated}} steam locomotives with a 4-8-2+2-8-4 Double Mountain {{type wheel}} arrangement in goods train {{service on the}} Mafeking line out of Johannesburg. The locomotives were built by Beyer, Peacock and Company. The initial designs of the Class GM Garratt by W.A.J. Day, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR from 1936 to 1939, were rejected by the Chief Civil Engineer, since the weight on the leading and trailing <b>bogies</b> of each <b>engine</b> unit would exceed the acceptable limit for the [...] rail of the Mafeking line. To overcome the axle load objections, the water capacity of the front water tank was reduced to 1600 imp gal while the rear bunker was redesigned to carry no water and with a coal capacity of 10 lt t. The meagre water supply, which would really only be sufficient for shunting purposes, would be augmented by semi-permanently coupling a purpose-built auxiliary water tender to the locomotive.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} the class, JA 1249 and 1272 were not {{withdrawn}} until March 1968, in distinct contrast to the types J, JB and North British JA cousins. In 1966, 12 JA class members (and four J class) received a full overhaul, six in 1967 and two in 1968. Use of steam on freight on the East Coast of the South Island finished in March 1969, and 15 JAs and the three Js rebuilt with North Island JA tenders and trailing <b>engine</b> <b>bogies</b> were maintained for service. JA 1267 was the last steam engine given an A grade overhaul by NZR in November 1968, and with the last three Js provided {{one of the last}} high speed steam services in the world, between Christchurch and Oamaru. The JA class lasted in front-line duty until the end of steam in New Zealand; the South Island Limited was then worked by steam locomotives until replaced by the diesel Southerner in November 1970. It was also planned to dieselise the overnight Friday Sunday express with surplus steam heat vans when the North Island Limited was replaced by the Silver Star, but late delivery of the new train from Japan meant the services were steam hauled for another year until 26 October 1971. The locomotives remained ready for service into November but were never called upon.|$|R
5000|$|The first 4 locomotives, {{produced}} by the Voroshilovgrad Locomotive Factory (in today's Lugansk, Ukraine), were delivered to Poland in September 1965. Deliveries continued until 1988, with 1,191 locomotives delivered in total (1,114 for PKP, 68 for LHS and 9 for industry). One of the locomotives (ST44-1500 - producer’s designation M63) had <b>bogies</b> and traction <b>engines</b> exchanged with newer types which allowed it to achieve a higher top speed. The series, with numbers between 2001 and 2068 was imported to run on the LHS broad gauge line. In addition to a different gauge, this series was equipped with an automatic coupling system.There were several reasons for importing M62 locomotives to Poland, and today’s views on this decision are quite ambiguous. The locomotive was more powerful than even the strongest of the Polish steam locomotives used for freight transport in those days, yet it could not haul passenger trains (due to lack of carriage heating devices) and caused huge damage to the railway tracks. Another important weakness of the M62 locomotive was with its vast fuel consumption. The advantages of this machine though are a fairly simple construction coupled with a largely reliable diesel-electric transmission. Intensive electrification of Polish railways caused the relatively new ST44 locomotives to be mothballed into reserve stock. Many machines withdrawn from PKP found their place among industrial and private railways, where they only bore the producer’s M62 designation ...|$|R
