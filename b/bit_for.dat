5|$|In September 1929 Casey was {{assigned}} to the Rivers and Harbors Section of the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington, DC. This job involved reviewing the project studies, plans and specifications of all river and harbor projects throughout the United States, including flood control and hydroelectric power projects. He also had responsibility for correspondence with U.S. senators and congressmen. During this time he co-designed and patented the Kingman-Casey Floating Mooring <b>Bit</b> <b>for</b> navigation locks. He was promoted to the substantive rank of captain on 1 May 1933.|$|E
25|$|While {{the term}} drill may refer {{to either a}} {{drilling}} machine or a drill <b>bit</b> <b>for</b> use in a drilling machine, in this article, for clarity, drill bit or bit is used throughout {{to refer to a}} <b>bit</b> <b>for</b> use in a drilling machine, and drill refers always to a drilling machine.|$|E

25|$|Two {{styles of}} auger bit are {{commonly}} used in hand braces: the Jennings or Jennings-pattern bit has a self-feeding screw tip, two spurs and two radial cutting edges. This bit has a double flute starting from the cutting edges, and extending several inches up the shank of the <b>bit,</b> <b>for</b> waste removal. This pattern of bit was developed by Russell Jennings in the mid-19th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{geometry}} and sharpening of the cutting edges {{is crucial to}} the performance of the bit. Small bits that become blunt are often discarded because sharpening them correctly is difficult and they are cheap to replace. For larger bits, special grinding jigs are available. A special tool grinder is available for sharpening or reshaping cutting surfaces on twist drill bits in order to optimize the <b>bit</b> <b>for</b> a particular material.|$|E
2500|$|... 8 {{bits per pixel}} – Sometimes palette mode, {{where each}} value is an index in a table with the real color value {{specified}} {{in one of the}} other formats. Sometimes three <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> red, three <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> green, and two <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> blue.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to two accumulators, the DASK had three index registers, {{which could be}} used to modify the address of most instructions. An instruction word consisted of 11 <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> an address, two <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> index register selection, and 7 <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> the operation code and its modifiers.|$|R
5000|$|Each 48-bit word {{contained}} two 24-bit instructions. The {{instruction format}} was 6-3-15: six <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> the operation code, three <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> a [...] "designator" [...] (index register for memory access instructions, condition for jump (branch) instructions) and fifteen <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> a memory address (or shift count, for shift instructions).|$|R
25|$|These bits are {{available}} both in a version similar to an auger bit or brace bit, designed for low speed, high torque use with a brace or other hand drill (pictured to the right), or {{as a high}} speed, low torque bit meant for a power drill. While {{the shape of the}} cutting edges is different, and one uses screw threads and the other a twist <b>bit</b> <b>for</b> the pilot, the method of adjusting them remains the same.|$|E
25|$|Installer bits are {{a type of}} {{twist drill}} <b>bit</b> <b>for</b> use with a hand-portable power tool. Installer bits are also known as bell-hanger bits or fishing bits. The key {{distinguishing}} feature of an installer bit is a transverse hole drilled through the web of the bit near the tip. Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through this transverse hole, and the bit pulled back through the drilled hole. The installer bit was invented and patented by Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn, New York in 1898.|$|E
25|$|Prepaid SIM {{cards are}} {{available}} {{from a variety of}} different outlets and sometimes appear on auction sites such as eBay. Their values range from 50 to 5,000 minutes; the 50 minute cards have no validity and the 75 minute vouchers are valid for only a month, but the 5,000 minute cards stay valid for two years. Since Iridium charges quite a <b>bit</b> <b>for</b> merely accessing their network without making calls it is possible to extend the validity of such an account by a month for around US$45. It is also possible to refill such an account without purchasing a new SIM card.|$|E

25|$|Engine offerings were shuffled a <b>bit</b> <b>for</b> 1980 {{with the}} {{standard}} Buick 231 V6 and optional 350 V8 carried over from 1979, with the Buick 350 making its last appearance this year. New options included a larger Buick-built 252 V6, an Oldsmobile-built 307 V8 and a 350 Diesel V8, also built by Oldsmobile. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the four-barrel turbocharged 231 V6 as its standard and only available powerplant. The Sport Coupe was dropped from the line after 1980 along with the Turbo V6 engine due to slow sales, with the Turbo V6 continued on the Regal and Riviera.|$|E
25|$|The {{center of}} the bit is a tapered screw thread. This screws into the wood as the bit is turned, and pulls the bit into the wood. There {{is no need for}} any force to push the bit into the workpiece, only the torque to turn the bit. This is ideal for a <b>bit</b> <b>for</b> a hand tool. The radial cutting edges remove a slice of wood of {{thickness}} equal to the pitch of the central screw for each rotation of the bit. To pull the bit from the hole, either the female thread in the wood workpiece must be stripped, or the rotation of the bit must be reversed.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Daytona, Johnson started 12th and led 35 laps before {{finishing}} {{second to}} Dale Earnhardt, Jr., in {{a repeat of}} the Talladega race. At Kentucky, Johnson started sixth and ran inside the top ten for most of the night, finishing ninth. At the second stop in Pocono, Johnson, along with two of his Hendrick teammates, Jeff Gordon, and Dale Earnhardt, Jr, took advantage of several cars running out of fuel to finish in the Top 6 (Gordon finished 3rd, Dale Jr. took 4th, Johnson grabbed 6th). At Watkins Glen, despite suffering two penalties (lap 3: Overshooting the entrance to the inner loop, and caution No. 1 (lap 26-28): Speeding through pit road) Johnson rallied to finish 10th. He wasn't so lucky at Michigan; late in the race, he got loose and spun in turn 3, and damaged the splitter on his car, resulting in a 39th-place finish (10 laps down). He rebounded at Bristol by finishing 4th, but had bad luck once more at Darlington. He spun out on lap 134 in turn 4, bringing out the 7th caution, and was never a real threat. He ended up 19th. He was able to recover a <b>bit</b> <b>for</b> a 9th-place finish at Richmond, and started 1st in the Chase in a three-way-tie between him, Kyle Busch, and Matt Kenseth.|$|E
50|$|This {{means that}} for the nine tables with both rooks home, {{and at least one}} on each side having castling rights, you always save 38 <b>bits</b> (20 <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> four rooks, 12 <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> two kings and 2 <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> the queens and, as in all cases, 4 <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> the castling rights). At the other extreme, with no rooks home, you only save the 4 castling bits. So the gains are much higher for an opening data base than for end games.|$|R

[...] Steven Tyler described Sanchez's performance as [...] "great" [...] while Randy Jackson noted that it was [...] "unbelievable, sensational". James Montgomery of MTV News graded her performance with a B, and called the cover [...] "a bit of an odd choice, and yet also a supremely confident one". He added, [...] "For once, she pulled things back, and maybe suffered a <b>bit</b> <b>for</b> doing so, but there were still plenty of subtly great moments, particularly in the verses.

CHS addressing with 24 bits always uses 6 <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> up to 63 sectors per track (1…63), and INT 13h disk access generally uses 8 <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> up to 256 heads (0…255), leaving 10 <b>bits</b> <b>for</b> up to 1024 cylinders (0…1023).
