5|$|A {{popular and}} more recent {{explanation}} for the Loch Ness monster among believers is that it belongs to a line of long-surviving plesiosaurs, but the kelpie myth still survives in children's <b>books</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Mollie Hunter's The Kelpie's Pearls (1966) and Dick King-Smith's The Water Horse (1990).|$|E
5|$|In {{literary}} works, Samuel Rogers' poem The Great Saint Bernard {{is sometimes}} referred to as Barry, The Great St. Bernard. Henry Bordeaux praised Barry's work in his 1911 novel La Neige sur les pas. Walt Disney Productions made a telemovie entitled Barry of the Great St. Bernard in 1977, and Barry's story has been featured in children's <b>books</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Barry: The Bravest Saint Bernard published by Random House Books for Young Readers.|$|E
5|$|In stamp {{collecting}} circles, the word forerunner usually describes {{a postage stamp}} used during the time period before a region or territory issues stamps of its own. However, in Irish reference <b>books,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Handbook of Irish Philately, the term forerunners usually refers to political and propaganda labels. These often resemble stamps, but few of them were used on Irish mail {{and they had no}} legal standing for mail in Ireland.|$|E

5|$|It was {{received}} positively by reviewers, with praise for its material for Dungeon Masters and its illustrations, but received criticism for its weak player-oriented content. The book {{was the second}} in the series of books about specific monster types, the first being Draconomicon. Similar books published since include Lords of Madness. Libris Mortis included content from older <b>books,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Tome and Blood and the Book of Vile Darkness, that had been reworked.|$|E
5|$|John Day (or Daye) (c. 1522 – 23 July 1584) was an English Protestant printer. He {{specialised}} in {{printing and}} distributing Protestant literature and pamphlets, and produced many small-format religious <b>books,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> ABCs, sermons, and translations of psalms. He found fame, however, as {{the publisher of}} John Foxe's Actes and Monuments, {{also known as the}} Book of Martyrs, the largest and most technologically accomplished book printed in sixteenth-century England.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the topics}} his {{research}} focused on was the discussion of fashion and femininity in the French fin-de-siècle.

5|$|The ACLU lost an {{important}} press censorship case when, in 1957, the Supreme Court upheld the obscenity conviction of publisher Samuel Roth for distributing adult magazines. As late as 1953, <b>books</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Tropic of Cancer and From Here to Eternity were still banned. But public standards rapidly became more liberal though the 1960s, and obscenity was notoriously difficult to define, so by 1971 prosecutions for obscenity had halted.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{influenced}} by works that Chahi liked at the time. The art and atmosphere were influenced by science fiction <b>books</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Dune, artists such as Michael Whelan, and comic illustrators such as Richard Corben.

5|$|As with film, {{the rivalry}} between the clubs' {{hooligan}} firms has been covered in <b>books</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Congratulations You Have Just Met the ICF by Cass Pennant, {{leader of the}} Inter City Firm. No One Likes Us, We Don't Care: True Stories from Millwall, Britain's Most Notorious Football Hooligans by Andrew Woods focuses on the fights between the two firms, {{from the perspective of}} Millwall's Bushwackers. Sunday Mirror columnist Michael Calvin spent the 2009–10 season covering Millwall, writing the book Family: Life, Death and Football. The beginning extensively features the rivalry and the stabbing of a Millwall supporter before the 2009 Upton Park riot game.|$|E
5|$|At the age of16, Buxton was illiterate, {{but with}} the aid of The Common Spelling Book he taught himself to read. He was unable to {{understand}} or pronounce all words correctly and so procured a copy of Jones Pronouncing Dictionary. He read more <b>books,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> A History of England and Goldsmith's History of Greece and Rome. Reading occupied all his spare time, although when trade was good he had to work from 6:00am until 9:00pm. He earned about 14 to 15 shillings (70p-75p) a week, a good wage for the time, but as cloth was superseding leather in making the tops of children shoes, this did not last.|$|E

5|$|Because of his {{willingness}} to tackle such issues as prostitution, extramarital sex and lesbianism, Moore's novels were initially met with disapproval. However, as the public's taste for realist fiction grew, this subsided. Moore began to find success as an art critic {{with the publication of}} <b>books</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Impressions and Opinions (1891) and Modern Painting (1893)—which was the first significant attempt to introduce the Impressionists to an English audience. By this time Moore was first able to live from the proceeds of his literary work.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain's {{reputation}} remains controversial among historians, {{with the}} initial high regard for him being entirely eroded by <b>books</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Guilty Men, published in July 1940, which blamed Chamberlain and his associates for the Munich accord and for allegedly failing to prepare the country for war. Most historians in the generation following Chamberlain's death held similar views, led by Churchill in The Gathering Storm. Some recent historians have taken a more favourable perspective of Chamberlain and his policies, citing government papers released under the Thirty Year Rule and arguing that {{going to war with}} Germany in 1938 would have been disastrous as the UK was not ready. Nevertheless, Chamberlain is still unfavourably ranked amongst British Prime Ministers.|$|E
5|$|Gould became {{widely known}} through his popular essays on {{evolution}} in the Natural History magazine.

Many of his essays were reprinted in collected volumes that became bestselling <b>books</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Ever Since Darwin and The Panda's Thumb, Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, and The Flamingo's Smile.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} to what extent, if any, the Hell Fire Club made use of the building. The author Michael Fewer has {{suggested}} that the remoteness of Mount Pelier's location is why there are almost no verifiable accounts of the activities that went on there. However, numerous (and very doubtful) stories surrounding the building have become part of local folklore, some of which have spread to a wider audience through publication in the nineteenth century in <b>books</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Robert Chambers' Book of Days (1864) and in The Gentleman's Magazine (1731–1922).|$|E
