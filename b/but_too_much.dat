25|$|The grape {{requires}} a long growing season, as it buds early and is slow to ripen. The grape requires sufficient warmth to ripen fully, <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> warmth and its flavours can become diluted. Harvests in Italy have traditionally begun after September 29, with modern harvest often {{taking place in}} mid-late October. A longer growing season gives the grapes time to develop richness and potential body. However, in cool vintages this can result in the grapes having high levels of acidity and harsh, unripened tannins. In regions (like some areas of Tuscany) that are prone to rainfall in October, {{there is a risk}} for rot due to the Sangiovese grape's thin skin. In other areas, such as the dry conditions of the Columbia Valley AVA of Washington State, the grape has good resistance to drought conditions and often requires little irrigation.|$|E
25|$|Grenache {{is often}} used as a {{blending}} component, adding body and sweet fruitiness to a wine. The grape can be troublesome for the winemaker due to tendency to oxidize easily and lose color. To compensate for the grape's naturally low tannins and phenolic compounds, some producers will use excessively harsh pressing and hot fermentation with stems to extract the maximal amount of color and phenols from the skins. This can backfire to produce green, herbaceous flavors and coarse, astringent wine lacking the grape's characteristic vibrant fruitiness. To maintain those character traits, Grenache responds best to a long, slow fermentation at cooler temperatures followed by a maceration period. To curb against oxidation, the wine should be racked as little as possible. The use of new oak barrels can help with retaining color and preventing oxidation <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> oak influence can cover up the fruitiness of Grenache.|$|E
25|$|The {{role that}} climate plays in {{influencing}} the ripening process cannot be overstated, {{but it is}} not the only factor. Vineyard management such as pruning and canopy management can also play a significant role as it not only influences the physiological processes of the grapevine but also how the vine responds in sharing its limited resources of energy and nutrients. The leaves of a grapevine produce energy via the process of photosynthesis. A certain amount of foliage is needed to ensure that the grapevine can produce enough energy to support all its physiological functions, <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> leaf cover will shade the grape clusters, limiting the direct exposure of sunlight and warmth needed for some chemical components of the grapes to develop. An excessive amount of foliage and shading may also promote the development of various vine diseases and ailments such as bunch rot and powdery mildew which can hamper the ripening process. A very vigorous vine with many clusters and vine shoots will have several parties competing for the same resources, with the overall development of an individual clusters thus slowed. Through the process of canopy management, viticulturists try to balance not only the amount of clusters and vine shoots on the vine but also try to achieve an optimal balance of needed foliage for photosynthesis without excessive shading that could hamper the ripening process.|$|E

500|$|Because {{there are}} both mutual and {{conflicting}} interests in most animal signalling systems, a central problem in signalling theory is dishonesty or cheating. [...] For example, if foraging birds are safer when {{they give a}} warning call, cheats could give false alarms at random, just in case a predator is nearby. [...] <b>But</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> cheating could cause the signalling system to collapse. Every dishonest signal weakens {{the integrity of the}} signalling system, and so reduces the fitness of the group. An example of dishonest signalling comes from Fiddler crabs such as Uca lactea mjoebergi, which have been shown to bluff (no conscious intention being implied) about their fighting ability. When a claw is lost, a crab occasionally regrows a weaker claw that nevertheless intimidates crabs with smaller but stronger claws. The proportion of dishonest signals is low enough for it not to be worthwhile for crabs to test the honesty of every signal through combat.|$|E

500|$|The {{broadcast}} media industry is {{at a critical}} turning point in its development, with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts. This move is {{made possible by the}} production of cheaper, faster and more capable integrated circuits. The chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts. For television, this includes the elimination of problems such as snowy pictures, ghosting and other distortion. These occur {{because of the nature of}} analog transmission, which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final output. Digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the final output. In a simplified example, if a binary message 1011 was transmitted with signal amplitudes [...] and received with signal amplitudes [...] it would still decode to the binary message 1011 — a perfect reproduction of what was sent. From this example, a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message. Using forward error correction a receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission.|$|E

This, I discovered, is why some are calling for Putin to stay on for a third term. Not because they admire him—privately, many say that he and his cronies are just as corrupt and disdainful of others as their communist predecessors were—but because they mistrust the idea of democracy, resent the West for pushing it, and fear what might happen as a result of next year's elections.

2500|$|However, Entertainment Weeklys Brad Wete complimented its {{themes and}} stated [...] "Simply put, Lasers beams".

Carrie Battan of The Boston Globe viewed that [...] "the album’s real sweet spots lie somewhere in the brief, breezy middle ground" [...] between [...] "angsty rap-metal crossover tracks" [...] and [...] "clubby, bass-thumping radio-rap jams". The A.V. Clubs Kyle Ryan gave the album a B- and commented that its synthesizers [...] " [...] it an au courant hip-hop sound", but criticized its lyrics and called it [...] "schizophrenic". Steve Jones of USA Today gave the album {{three out of four}} stars and wrote that it [...] "has several shining moments but falls short of the overall excellence" [...] of his previous albums. Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot gave the album two-and-half out of four stars and stated [...] "Its best music shows what it might have been. The rest feels more like an obligation reluctantly met, a difficult bridge to the next phase of Lupe Fiasco’s career". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times expressed a mixed response towards its music and called Lasers [...] "a chaotic album full of gummy rhymes that look better on the page than they sound to the ear, delivered with a tone of tragic bombast". Slant Magazine's Matthew Cole perceived [...] "no bridging the gap between Laserss radical message and its utterly conventional sound", commenting that [...] "In moments of dazzling clarity, Lupe spits hip-hop prophecy, <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of Lasers is given over to self-serious jeremiads on race, rap, and politics, or pop-rap pandering".|$|E
2500|$|As well as {{resulting}} trusts, {{where the}} courts have presumed that the transferor would have intended the property return, there are resulting trusts which arise by automatic operation of the law. A key example is where property is transferred to a trustee, <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> is handed over. The surplus will be held by the recipient on a resulting trust. For example, in the Privy Council case of Air Jamaica Ltd v Charlton an airline's pension plan was overfunded, so that all employees could be paid the benefits that they were due under their employment contracts, but a surplus remained. The company argued that it should receive the money, because it had attempted to amend the scheme's terms, and the Jamaican government argued that it should receive the money, as bona vacantia because the scheme's original terms had stated money was not {{to return to the}} company, and the employees had all received their entitlements. However, the Privy Council advised both were wrong and the money should return to those who had made contributions to the fund: half the company and half the employees, on resulting trust. This was in response, according to Lord Millett, [...] "to the absence of any intention on his part to pass a beneficial interest to the recipient." [...] In a similar pattern, it was held in Vandervell v Inland Revenue Commissioners that an option to repurchase shares in a company was held on resulting trust for Mr Vandervell when he declared the option to be held by his family trustees, but did not say who he meant the option to be held on trust for. Mr Vandervell had been trying to make a gift of £250,000 to the Royal College of Surgeons without paying any transfer tax, and thought that he could do it if he transferred the College some shares in his company, let the company pay out enough dividends, and then bought the shares back. However, the Income Tax Act 1952 section 415(2), applied a tax to a settlor of a trust for any income made out of trusts, if the settlor retained any interest whatsoever. Because Mr Vandervell did not say who the option was meant to be for, the House of Lords concluded the option was held on trust for him, and therefore he was taxed. It has also been said, that trusts which arise when one person gives property to another for a reason, but then the reason fails, as in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd are resulting in nature. However, Lord Millett in his judgment in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley' ',(dissenting on the knowing receipt point, leading on the Quistclose point) recategorised the trust which arises as an immediate express trust {{for the benefit of the}} transferor, albeit with a mandate upon the recipient to apply the assets for a purpose stated in the contract.|$|E
