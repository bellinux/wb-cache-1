They {{live out}} in the Southwest, {{in one of the}} most {{wonderful}} places in all this great land, a place called the Grand Canyon. One is called the Abert Squirrel and the other the Kaibab Squirrel. They are about the size of Happy Jack and Rusty but have broader, handsomer tails and their ears have long tufts of hair. The Abert Squirrel has black ears, a brown <b>back,</b> <b>gray</b> sides and white underneath. Kaibab has brown ears with black tips, and his tail is mostly white. Both are very lovely, but their families are small and so they are little known." ...|$|E
60|$|And at {{last day}} did come <b>back,</b> <b>gray</b> and drear. He saw {{suddenly}} once more. I think {{he must have}} been wandering the glen with his eyes shut, as one does shut them involuntarily against the hidden dangers of black night. How different was daylight from what he had expected! He looked, and then shut his dazed eyes again, for the darkness was less horrible than the day. Had he indeed seen, or only dreamed that he saw? Once more he looked to see what the world was like; and the sight that met his eyes was so mournful that he who had fought through the long night now sank hopeless and helpless among the heather. The dog was not far away, and it, too, lost heart. Gavin held out his hand, and Snap crept timidly toward him. He unloosened his coat, and the dog nestled against him, cowed and shivering, hiding its head from the day, Thus they lay, and the rain beat upon them.|$|E

50|$|His {{performance}} on the wing earned the famous tribute from Revie that when he plays on snow, he doesn't leave any footprints.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1279994/THE-LIST-Top-50-managerial-quotes-time-Nos-10-1.html Gray played in the team which reached the 1975 European Cup Final in Paris, featuring in the home victory against the Spanish champions Barcelona in the semi final, during which Gray would torment his marking full back de la Cruz and push Barcelona on the back foot, allowing Leeds to dominate. However, he was left from the starting line up for the final by manager Jimmy Armfield, which Leeds {{would go on to}} lose controversially to Bayern Munich. Also featuring in this campaign was his younger brother Frank, who had likewise come through the ranks at Elland Road. This was the swansong of the great Don Revie team (Revie himself had left a year earlier to take over as England manager) and Gray's teammates started to leave the club. By the early 1980s, Gray was the only player from any part of the Revie era still at the club (although Peter Lorimer and David Harvey would later make comebacks). Converted to left <b>back,</b> <b>Gray</b> prolonged his career and was in the side which was relegated under former teammate Allan Clarke in 1982.|$|E
