Its initial strength was 7 officers and 196 enlisted men; by December 1946 it had 9 officers and 486 men, and was manning 44 guard posts 24 hours a day. The Provisional Engineer Detachment (PED), 4817th Service Command Unit, was activated at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana, on 10 April 1943. These men performed jobs around the post such as working in the <b>boiler</b> <b>plant,</b> the motor pool and the mess halls. They also maintained the buildings and roads.

The construction contract was terminated on 15 February, and the remaining insulation and electrical work was assigned to other firms in the Oak Ridge area. They also completed the auxiliary buildings, including the new steam plant. The plant became fully operational in March 1945. Construction of the new <b>boiler</b> <b>plant</b> was approved on 16 February 1945. The first boiler was started on 5 July 1945, and operations commenced on 13 July.

500|$|The Thermal Diffusion Process Building (F01) {{was a black}} {{structure}} [...] long, [...] feet wide, and [...] high. There was one {{control room}} and one transfer room for each pair of racks, except for the final one, which had its own control and transfer rooms for training purposes. Four pumps drew [...] per minute of cooling water from the Clinch River. Steam pumps were specially designed by Pacific Pumps Inc. The plant was designed to use the entire output of the K-25 powerhouse, but as K-25 stages came online there was competition for this. It was decided {{to build a new}} <b>boiler</b> <b>plant.</b> Twelve surplus [...] boilers originally intended for destroyer escorts were acquired from the navy.

In addition to the Thermal Diffusion Process Building (F01) and the new steam plant (F06) buildings, structures in the S-50 area included the pumping station (F02), laboratories, a cafeteria, machine shop (F10), warehouses, a gas station, and a water treatment plant (F03).|$|E

[...] The program was designed with a payback period of 13 years based upon projected electricity and water savings. The university also completed a study to install a cogeneration unit, which utilizes the heat given off by the natural gas power unit to heat the steam that is piped into campus buildings for climate control. This model replaces the current model ("business as usual" [...] alternative), which uses a utility power plant that exhausts heat to the atmosphere and a separate <b>boiler</b> <b>plant</b> to generate the steam, while also increasing efficiency of both processes.|$|E
