50|$|While a <b>basic</b> <b>coding</b> {{existed for}} most of the new objects {{introduced}} by the GML/G-XML agreement, and for some introduced by Galdos within the OGC process (notably coverages), it soon became apparent that few of these encodings were compliant with the abstract specifications developed by the ISO TC/211, specifications which were increasingly becoming the basis for all OGC specifications. GML geometry, for example, had been based on an earlier and only partly documented geometry model (Simple Features Geometry) and this was insufficient to support the more extensive and complex geometries described in TC/211. The management of GML development was also altered in this time frame with the participation of many more individuals.

During the pre-production of Dredd, while going through a book by Murray Shanahan about consciousness and embodiment, Garland had an [...] "epiphany." [...] The idea was written down and put aside till later. Shanahan, along with Adam Rutherford, became a consultant for the film, and the ISBN of his book is referred to as an easter egg in the film.

Wanting total creative freedom, without having to add conventional action sequences, he made the film on as small a budget as possible.|$|E

40|$|For {{any given}} short code (referred {{to as the}} <b>basic</b> <b>code),</b> block Markov {{superposition}} transmission (BMST) provides {{a simple way to}} obtain predictable extra coding gain by spatial coupling the generator matrix of the <b>basic</b> <b>code.</b> This paper presents a systematic design methodology for BMST systems to approach the channel capacity at any given target bit-error-rate (BER) of interest. To simplify the design, we choose the <b>basic</b> <b>code</b> as the Cartesian product of a short block code. The encoding memory is then inferred from the genie-aided lower bound according to the performance gap of the short block code to the corresponding Shannon limit at the target BER. In addition to the sliding-window decoding algorithm, we propose to perform one more phase decoding to remove residual (rare) errors. A new technique that assumes a noisy genie is proposed to upper bound the performance. Under some mild assumptions, these genie-aided bounds can be used to predict the performance of the proposed two-phase decoding algorithm in the extremely low BER region. Using the Cartesian product of a repetition <b>code</b> as the <b>basic</b> <b>code,</b> we construct a BMST system with an encoding memory 30 whose performance at the BER of $ 10 ^{- 15 }$ can be predicted within one dB away from the Shannon limit over the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channel (BI-AWGNC) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Regenerating code is a {{class of}} storage codes that achieve the optimal {{trade-off}} between storage capacity and repair bandwidth, which are two important performance metrics in data storage systems. However, existing constructions of regenerating codes rely on expensive computational operations such as finite field multiplication. The high coding and repair complexity limit their applications in large-scale practical storage systems. In this paper, we show {{that it is possible}} to achieve the full potential of regenerating codes with low computational complexity. In particular, we propose a new class of regenerating <b>codes,</b> called <b>BASIC</b> <b>codes,</b> that can achieve two specific points (i. e., minimum-bandwidth and minimum-storage regenerating points) on the storage and repair bandwidth trade-off curve, using only binary addition and shift operations in the coding and repair processes. Although in this paper we focus on constructing and analyzing <b>BASIC</b> <b>codes</b> for two specific exact-repair settings, our framework can be generalized to develop <b>BASIC</b> <b>codes</b> for more general exact- and functional-repair regenerating codes.
