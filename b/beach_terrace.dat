5000|$|Although Niebla arenaria was {{described}} in 1996, it had been known earlier as a chemical variant of Niebla pulchribarbara that was distinguished from Niebla homalea by containing depsidones instead of depsides, and from Niebla josecuervoi {{by the lack of}} central basal attachment point and without apothecia. [...] These two groups of lichen substances could be separated by the medulla reaction to para-phenylenediamine, depsidones (pd+), depsides (pd-).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of dating fossil solitary corals from Pleistocene marine strandlines outside tropical latitudes using the recently developed high sensitivity, high-precision U-series technique based on thermal-ionization mass-spectrometry (TIMS). The TIMS technique is much more efficient than conventional a spectrometry and, as a result, multiple samples of an individual coral skeleton, or different specimens from the same bed can be analyzed. Detached and well-rounded fossil specimens of the solitary coral Balanophyllia elegans were collected from relict littoral deposits on emergent marine terraces along the California coast at Cayucos terrace (elevation 8 m, previously dated at 124 and 117 Ky by α counting), Shell <b>Beach</b> <b>terrace</b> (elevation about 25 m, previously undated), Nestor terrace, San Diego (elevation 23 m, previously dated at 131 to 109 Ky), Bird Rock terrace, San Diego (elevation 8 m, previously dated at 81 Ky). Attached living specimens were collected from the intertidal zone on the modern terrace at Moss Beach. Concentrations of ^(232) Th in both living and fossil specimens are much higher than in reef-building corals (12 to 624 pmol/g vs. 0. 1 to 1. 6 pmol/g, respectively). However, because ^(230) Th/^(232) Th in Balanophyllia elegans are very low (2. 22 × 10 ^(− 3) to 4. 33 × 10 ^(− 4)), the high ^(232) Th concentrations have negligible effect on the ^(230) Th-^(234) U dates. The high ^(232) Th concentration in the living specimen (33. 1 pmol/g) indicates that a significant amount of ^(232) Th is incorporated in the aragonitic skeleton during growth, or attached to clay-sized silicates trapped in the skeletal material. The calculated initial ^(234) U activities in the fossil specimens of Balanophyllia elegans are higher than the ^(234) U activity in modern seawater or in the modern specimen. The higher initial activities could possibly reflect the influx of ^(234) U-enriched continental water into Pleistocene coastal waters, or it could reflect minor diagenetic alteration, a persistent and fundamental problem in dating all corals. Samples from a compound specimen from the Cayucos terrace were subjected to different preparation procedures. Samples prepared by a standard acid washing procedure yielded ^(230) Th-^(234) U ages of 125, 123, and 122 Ky, whereas samples prepared by an abbreviated procedure without acid washing yield significantly lower ages of 113 and 112 Ky. Two other specimens from the same bed yielded ^(230) Th-^(234) U ages of 118 and 115 Ky. Also, two specimens from a stratigraphically higher bed yielded ages of 120 and 117 Ky, and three specimens from a lower bed yield ages of 115, 113, and 101 Ky. Nine of the twelve ages of the treated samples from the Cayucos terrace range from 125 to 113 Ky. However, the ages do not follow the stratigraphie order. Two possible interpretations are (1) the age of the terrace deposit is 125 Ky and all younger ages reflect variable diagenetic alteration or (2) the age of the terrace is 125 to 113 Ky and the ages reflect sediment reworking over a period of 12 Ky. Three specimens from a single bed on the Shell <b>Beach</b> <b>terrace</b> yield ages of 126, 122, and 121 Ky, similar to the older ages from Cayucos. The ages of solitary corals from the Cayucos and Shell Beach terraces are similar to ages of reef-building corals from terraces at numerous tropical localities. These are correlated with the last interglacial sea-level highstand, which probably stood 2 to 10 m above present sea level. The youngest ages and present elevations of the Cayucos and Shell Beach terraces yield tectonic uplift rates of 0. 01 and 0. 15 m/Ky, respectively, assuming the original elevation of each terrace was 7 m. Four specimens from the basal gravel on the Nestor terrace yielded ages of 145, 143, 137, and 133 Ky. The three oldest ages, however, are older than that associated with the last interglacial. The possible explanations for these older ages are (1) diagenic alteration or (2) the Nestor terrace deposits reflect in some way a poorly documented early phase of the last interglacial sea level high stand...|$|E
40|$|The coastal landforms {{along the}} south west coast of Kanyakumari have {{undergone}} remarkable change in terms of shape and disposition due to both natural and anthropogenic interference. An attempt is made here to map the coastal landforms along the coast using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Spatial data sources, such as, topographical map published by Survey of India, Landsat ETM+ (30  m) image, IKONOS image (0. 82  m), SRTM and ASTER DEM datasets have been comprehensively analyzed for extracting coastal landforms. Change detection methods, such as, (i) topographical change detection, (ii) cross-shore profile analysis, (iii) Geomorphic Change Detection (GCD) using DEM of Difference (DoD) were adopted for assessment of volumetric changes of coastal landforms for the period between 2000 and 2011. The GCD analysis uses ASTER and SRTM DEM datasets by resampling them into common scale (pixel size) using pixel-by-pixel based Wavelet Transform and Pan-Sharpening techniques in ERDAS Imagine software. Volumetric changes of coastal landforms were validated with data derived from GPS-based field survey. Coastal landform units were mapped based on process of their evolution such as beach landforms including sandy beach, cusp, berm, scarp, <b>beach</b> <b>terrace,</b> upland, rockyshore, cliffs, wave-cut notches and wave-cut platforms; and the fluvial landforms. Comprising of alluvial plain, flood plains, and other shallow marshes in estuaries. The topographical change analysis reveals that the beach landforms have reduced their elevation ranging from 1 to 3  m probably due to sediment removal or flattening. Analysis of cross-shore profiles for twelve locations indicate varying degrees of loss or gain of coastal landforms. For example, the K 3 -K 3 ′ profile across the Kovalam coast has shown significant erosion (− 0. 26 to − 0. 76  m) of the sandy beaches resulting {{in the formation of}} beach cusps and beach scarps within a distance of 300  m from the shoreline. The volumetric change of sediment load estimated based on DoD model depict a loss of 241. 69  m 3 /km 2 for 62. 82  km 2 of the area and land gain of 6. 96  m 3 /km 2 for 202. 80  km 2 of the area during 2000 – 2011.

40|$|The {{reproductive}} periodicity, {{recruitment and}} population {{studies of the}} intertidal Indo-Pacific echinoid, Arachnoides placenta (Linnaeus), were investigated from April 2001 to September 2002 at sites along 650 km of the north Queensland coast, Australia. Three locations were sampled, comprising Mission Beach; Pallarenda Beach Townsville; and the Mackay region. A. placenta is a dominant macro-organism at all sites sampled, individuals of all sizes are found across the entire stretch of the <b>beach</b> <b>terrace</b> but are rarely evenly distributed, displaying a preference for pools and ripples containing wet sand. Despite patchiness {{a significant decrease in}} density downshore was observed in 11 / 17 transects laid at Pallarenda Beach, 2001 (p = < 0. 05). Significant differences in density were observed between all sites (p = 0. 000) and even over distances of metres (p = 0. 006). A maximum density of 88 individuals m- 2 was recorded at Mackay in 2002. There was also clear temporal and spatial variation in the size-frequency of the population at Pallarenda Beach and significant differences in test diameter between sites (p = 0. 000) which clearly shows no effect of latitude on test diameter. At Pallarenda Beach test diameter was observed to increase with distance downshore in 13 / 17 transects. Test diameter at Bucasia Beach, Mackay on the contrary decreased with distance downshore. No relationship between test diameter and population size was observed. Significant differences in population density and size-frequency data even over scales of just metres suggest that discrete differences in abiotic or biotic factors, particularly sediment grain size, moisture and protection from wave action, between sites are enough to produce significant variations between populations. Growth of A. placenta from settlement demonstrates an s-shaped growth curve that is typical of a number of echinoid species. From a size of approximately 10 mm growth assumes a linear phase which slows at a size of 25 mm, at which size individuals are estimated to be 3 or 4 years old. The reproductive periodicity of Arachnoides placenta exhibited an overall seasonal cycle with a period of gamete growth and accumulation from December to February culminating in a March to May main spawning period. Gametogenic patterns at Pallarenda Beach indicate the breeding season of A. placenta coincides with the start of a decline in sea water temperatures that occurs from March (26 – 28 oC) which reaches a minimum over the months of June – August (22 – 24 oC). Partial spawning was observed in some individuals to June/July with a few spawning until September at Pallarenda Beach, indicating the continuation of spawning until temperatures reached a minimum. Over the range studied, A. placenta experienced similar annual air/sea water cycles and relatively comparable rainfall cycles. Air temperatures varied a maximum of ± 8 oC from those of Townsville, possibly accounting for minimal differences in gametogenesis between sites. Spawning was only synchronous between males and females during months of the major spawning period (March to July), during which female gonads returned to the recovering condition within a month or less of spawning. From July to November no female gonads were in the late mature stage and a very slow rate of gametogenesis was observed. In males, 30 - 100...|$|E
