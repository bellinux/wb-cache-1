5|$|Initially, forecasters {{believed}} Alex {{would remain}} weak, {{and on the}} first advisory the storm was predicted to make landfall as a minimal tropical storm. However, when strengthening <b>became</b> <b>evident,</b> the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning from Cape Lookout to Oregon Inlet about 20hours before hurricane conditions were experienced. In addition, a tropical storm warning existed {{for much of the}} North Carolina coastline as Alex paralleled the state.|$|E
5|$|The administration's new vigorously anti-Soviet policy also <b>became</b> <b>evident</b> when, at Kennan's suggestion, the U.S. {{changed its}} hostility to Francisco Franco's anti-communists regime in Spain {{in order to}} secure U.S. {{influence}} in the Mediterranean. Kennan had observed during 1947 that the Truman Doctrine implied a new consideration of Franco. His suggestion soon helped begin a new phase of U.S.–Spanish relations, which ended with military cooperation after 1950.|$|E

5|$|A {{small number}} of Ju 87s were also {{retained}} for anti-shipping operations in the Black Sea, a role it had proved so successful in when operating in the Mediterranean. In October 1943, this <b>became</b> <b>evident</b> again when StG 3 carried out several attacks against the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. On 6 October 1943 the most powerful flotilla in the fleet comprising the Leningrad class destroyers Kharkov, Besposhchadny and Sposobny were caught and sunk by dive -bombing. After the disaster, Josef Stalin decreed that no more ships were to pass within range of German aircraft without his personal permission.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on November5. It tracked steadily west across the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Its forward motion slowed after it passed the Lesser Antilles on November12. A large well-defined anticyclone persisted across much of the Caribbean Sea, providing a favorable environment for the system. A low-level circulation gradually <b>became</b> <b>evident</b> on satellite imagery within the disturbance. Based on ship observations, the National Hurricane Center estimated that the system organized into a tropical depression on November17, about 280miles (450km) south of the western tip of Haiti.|$|E

Thus the total {{defeat of the}} PZPR and its {{satellite}} parties {{came as a surprise}} to all involved: after the first round of elections, it <b>became</b> <b>evident</b> that Solidarity had fared extremely well, capturing 160 of 161 contested Sejm seats, and 92 of 100 Senate seats. After the second round, it had won virtually every seat—all 161 in the Sejm, and 99 in the Senate.|$|E

Whether the governor actually could connect the Princeps {{to the death of}} Germanicus is unknown; rather than continuing to stand trial when it <b>became</b> <b>evident</b> that the Senate was against him, Piso committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|The {{disagreements}} {{between the}} leading barons {{involved in the}} revolt soon <b>became</b> <b>evident.</b> De Montfort championed radical reforms that would place further limitations on the authority {{and power of the}} major barons as well as the Crown; others, such as Hugh Bigod, promoted only moderate change, while the conservative barons, such as de Clare, expressed concerns about the existing limitations on the King's powers. Henry's son, Edward, initially opposed the revolution, but then allied himself with de Montfort, helping him to pass the radical Provisions of Westminster in 1259, which introduced further limits on the major barons and local royal officials.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Neki {{were from a}} surface trough that persisted near the equator in the central Pacific Ocean {{in the middle of}} October 2009. A weak {{tropical}} disturbance <b>became</b> <b>evident</b> in the trough on October15, and three days later the system began developing curved bands of convection on its northern and southern periphery. This created an unusually large gyre for the region. Following the formation of a well-defined circulation, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Three-C late on October18, about 730mi (1175km) south of Ka Lae, Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|This first <b>became</b> <b>evident</b> in {{the great}} {{campaign}} to re-elect Gladstone. Known today as the Midlothian campaign, it was masterminded by the Roseberys. Rosebery used his influence to have Gladstone invited to stand as parliamentary candidate for Midlothian, near to Rosebery's Dalmeny estate. Gladstone had nominally retired from politics after losing his Greenwich seat in 1874, when Disraeli had been swept to power. The campaign was based at Dalmeny where Lady Rosebery hosted a series of large political house parties throughout the long campaign. The Tories were later to claim that Rosebery had paid for Gladstone's campaign. Rosebery later admitted to spending £50,000.|$|E

On 16 November, Mitterrand met with Gaddafi on Crete, {{under the auspices}} of the Greek prime minister Papandreou. Despite Gaddafi's declaration that all Libyan forces had been withdrawn, the next day Mitterrand admitted that this was not true. However, he did not order French troops back to Chad.|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} in the Indian Ocean {{intertropical convergence zone}} <b>became</b> <b>evident</b> southeast of the Chagos Archipelago on March16 after two cyclones {{moved away from the}} region. Based on analysis from MF, the system slowly organized while moving westward, its movement influenced by a subtropical ridge to the south. On March17, the JTWC also began tracking the system. Due to cool, dry air, the system initially did not intensify, although its passage over warmer sea surface temperatures on March19 allowed for strengthening. On March19, MF classified the disturbance as Tropical Storm Nadia after rainbands developed. A day later, the JTWC designated Nadia as Tropical Cyclone 23S.|$|E
5|$|After being named, Gamede quickly intensified, and the JTWC {{classified}} it with {{winds of}} 120km/h (75mph) early on February 22. As it turned west-southwestward, an eye feature <b>became</b> <b>evident</b> on satellite imagery, and the JTWC upgraded Gamede to tropical cyclone status, or the equivalence of a minimal hurricane. Subsequently, its intensification rate slowed somewhat, due to restricted outflow. At 0000UTC on February 23 the MFR upgraded the storm to Tropical Cyclone Gamede, and shortly thereafter it passed over St. Brandon island. Subsequently, outflow became better established, and the JTWC unofficially estimated the cyclone attained winds of 185km/h (115mph) late on February 23 about 250km (400mi) north-northeast of Mauritius island. Initially it was forecast to strengthen further, though slight weakening occurred when a nearby upper-level trough restricted outflow.|$|E
