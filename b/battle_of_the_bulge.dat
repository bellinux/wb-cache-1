5|$|All {{who were}} wounded and {{captured}} recovered {{to return home}} after the war. In 1965, the U.S. Army published a multi-volume history of World War II, including one on The Ardennes: The <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge.</b> Author Hugh M. Cole only briefly mentioned Bouck's platoon, which upset former platoon member William James (who had changed his name from Tsakanikas). James contacted Bouck and encouraged him to get his men proper recognition.|$|E
5|$|Despite its name, the 6th Airborne Division {{was one of}} {{only two}} {{airborne}} divisions raised by the British Army during the Second World War. Before being deployed to Palestine, the division had served only in Europe. It had participated in the Normandy landings in June 1944 and later the <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge</b> in December. After the Rhine crossing in March 1945, it spent six weeks advancing across Germany to the Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{determined}} {{resistance of}} the 99th Division, which was composed of relatively inexperienced troops, along with the experienced 2nd and 30th Divisions, the northern shoulder of the <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge</b> was a sticking point for the entire offensive operation. Had the Americans given way, the German advance would have overrun the vast supply depots around Liège and Spa and possibly have changed {{the outcome of the}} Battle of Bulge.|$|E

5|$|In August 1944, it was {{the first}} Allied unit to enter Belgium when it was {{deployed}} to the Ardennes and Limburg. The small team, mounted in armed Jeeps, managed to kill more than 300 German soldiers and destroy over 100 vehicles during the mission. Later, the unit fought in the Netherlands and also served as a reconnaissance unit in the Ardennes during the <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge</b> in the winter of 1944.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of December, under bad weather conditions, the Nazis {{launched}} an offensive in the Ardennes. The Luftwaffe caught many squadrons off guard. No.410 Squadron enjoyed a number of successes during this period, some of them even on Christmas Day. During the <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge,</b> the entire RAF Second Tactical Air Force, including No.410 Squadron, was on 48-hour alert.|$|E
5|$|After the 1942 season, Lavelli {{was drafted}} by the U.S. Army as American {{involvement}} in World War II intensified. After basic training {{and a number of}} other specialized courses on land-sea assaults, he was sent with the 28th Infantry Division to fight in the European Theatre of World War II. There his division landed on Omaha Beach, part of the Allied invasion of Germany-occupied France in 1944. He was involved with American forces in Germany's <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge</b> offensive and in the Siege of Bastogne later the same year. One in five members of his division was killed in battle.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Moscow, {{he was one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{leaders in}} {{building}} defenses on the approaches to Moscow and engineer support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West front offensive. From April 1942, he was commander of engineer troops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Army. Headed <b>the</b> building <b>of</b> defenses near Stalingrad, coordinated actions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engineer troops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Leningrad and Volkhov fronts in lifting the Leningrad blockade; did {{a great amount of}} work in preparing defenses in <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kursk <b>Bulge</b> and made a tangible contribution to engineering support in crossing major water obstacles, especially the Dnieper. He left his position in 1952.|$|R
5|$|The unit {{subsequently}} {{moved back}} to the Naktong River, and was involved in the subsequent Pusan Perimeter campaign during August and September 1950. During <b>the</b> First <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Naktong <b>Bulge,</b> <b>the</b> 19th Infantry was moved up from reserve positions in to combat the NK 4th Division, which was attempting to break through their lines. Having been badly mauled in these fights, the division was moved into reserve along the Pusan Perimeter on 23 September. It was replaced by units <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Infantry Division. In the subsequent Great Naktong Offensive, the 19th Infantry served as a reserve force to help units under attack in <b>the</b> Second <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Naktong <b>Bulge.</b> <b>The</b> 19th Infantry would later participate in <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Kyongju, assisting troops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic <b>of</b> Korea Army to help push back North Korean troops from the Kyongju area. During these battles, Red Cloud's experience as a combat veteran made him a valued member of his unit for leading the less experienced troops.|$|R
5|$|During <b>the</b> nearby Second <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Naktong <b>Bulge,</b> <b>the</b> North Korean People's Army {{broke through}} the US Army's 2nd Infantry Division lines along the Naktong River. Exploiting this weakness, the NK 9th Division and NK 4th Division {{attacked}} to Yongsan, a village east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river and the gateway to <b>the</b> UN lines <b>of</b> supply and reinforcement for the Pusan Perimeter. What followed was a fight between North Korean and US forces for Yongsan.|$|R
5|$|In 1940 Johnson had an {{operation}} to reset his collarbone, and began flying regularly. He {{took part in}} the offensive sweeps over German-occupied Europe from 1941 to 1944, almost without rest. Johnson was involved in heavy aerial fighting during this period. His combat tour included participation in the Dieppe Raid, Combined Bomber Offensive, Battle of Normandy, Operation Market Garden,the <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge</b> and the Western Allied invasion of Germany. Johnson progressed to the rank of group captain {{by the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944, the Luftwaffe Operation Bodenplatte {{with the}} aim of {{crippling}} Allied tactical air forces based in the Low Countries, and thus reviving the bogged-down progress of the Wehrmacht during the <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge.</b> The operation was launched on New Year's Day, 1945. JG 1 participated in this action with orders to destroy as many enemy aircraft on the ground as possible. Although a large number of allied aircraft were destroyed, the Luftwaffe lost a large number of pilots that were irreplaceable.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the war, {{large numbers of}} public memorials were erected {{around the country in}} memory of Belgian soldiers who had died fighting for the Allied cause during the conflict. There are numerous monuments and streets dedicated to Allied politicians and generals, including Franklin Roosevelt and Bernard Montgomery in Brussels. The large numbers of British and American cemeteries and memorials, particularly in the Ardennes region associated with the <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge,</b> meant that the legacy of the war was very visible.|$|E
50|$|In {{the extreme}} south, Brandenberger's three {{infantry}} divisions were checked by divisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. VIII Corps after an advance of 4 mi; that front was then firmly held. Only the 5th Parachute Division of Brandenberger's command {{was able to}} thrust forward 12 mi on the inner flank to partially fulfill its assigned role. Eisenhower and his principal commanders realized by 17 December that the fighting in the Ardennes was a major offensive and not a local counterattack, and they ordered vast reinforcements to the area. Within a week 250,000 troops had been sent. General Gavin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 82nd Airborne Division {{arrived on the scene}} first and ordered the 101st to hold Bastogne while the 82nd would take the more difficult task <b>of</b> facing <b>the</b> SS Panzer Divisions; it was also thrown into <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulge,</b> near Elsenborn Ridge.|$|R
50|$|Two regiments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> KPA 10th Division, the 29th to {{the south}} and the 25th to the north, were to make the assault {{crossing}} with the 27th Regiment in reserve. The 2nd Battalion, 29th Regiment, was <b>the</b> first unit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> division to cross the river. Its troops waded across undetected during <b>the</b> night <b>of</b> August 11/12, west of Hyongp'ung. It then occupied Hill 265, a northern spur of Hill 409, 2 mi southwest of Hyongp'ung, and set up machine gun positions. The other two battalions followed it and occupied Hill 409. The North Koreans on Hill 409 soon ambushed a patrol from the 21st Infantry Regiment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 24th Infantry Division, which was moving north and trying to establish contact with the 7th Cavalry Regiment during <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Naktong <b>Bulge</b> occurring simultaneously {{to the south}}.|$|R
5|$|After <b>the</b> First <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Naktong <b>Bulge,</b> <b>the</b> US Army's 2nd Infantry Division {{was moved}} to defend the Naktong River line. The division, which was untried in combat, was struck with a strong attack by several {{divisions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Korean People's Army which crossed the river and struck all along the division's line. <b>The</b> force <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack split the US 2nd Infantry Division in half, and the North Koreans were able to penetrate to Yongsan, promoting a fight there.|$|R
5|$|Lieutenant General Troy Houston Middleton (12 October 1889 – 9 October 1976) was a {{distinguished}} educator and senior {{officer of the}} United States Army {{who served as a}} corps commander in the European Theatre during World War II and later as president of Louisiana State University (LSU). He {{is best known for his}} decision to hold Bastogne during the <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge,</b> contrary to the recommendation of Lieutenant General George S. Patton, Jr., Commanding General (CG) of the United States Third Army.|$|E
5|$|Model {{first came}} to Hitler's {{attention}} before World War II, but their relationship did not become especially close until 1942. His tenacious style of fighting and dedication to the Nazi cause won him plaudits from Hitler, who considered him {{one of his best}} field commanders and repeatedly tasked him with retrieving desperate situations. However, their relationship had broken down {{by the end of the}} war after Model was defeated at the <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge.</b> In April 1945, with the Third Reich's defeat imminent, Model committed suicide rather than be captured and stand trial for war crimes.|$|E
5|$|Operation Bodenplatte (Baseplate), {{launched}} on 1 January 1945, {{was an attempt}} by the Luftwaffe to cripple Allied air forces in the Low Countries during the Second World War. The goal of Bodenplatte was to gain air superiority during the stagnant stage of the <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge</b> so that the German Army and Waffen-SS forces could resume their advance. The operation was planned for 16 December 1944, but was delayed repeatedly due to bad weather until New Year’s Day, the first day that happened to be suitable.|$|E
500|$|At 03:00, 1 September, the 9th Infantry Regiment ordered {{its only}} reserve, E Company, to move west along the Yongsan-Naktong River road {{and take a}} {{blocking}} position at the pass between Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni Ridge, [...] from the river and [...] from Yongsan. This was the critical terrain where so much heavy fighting {{had taken place in}} <b>the</b> first <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Naktong <b>Bulge.</b> Fighting began at the pass at 02:30. A strong North Korean force surprised and delivered heavy automatic fire at 03:30 from positions astride <b>the</b> road east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pass. With <b>the</b> critical parts <b>of</b> Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni Ridge, the best defensive terrain between Yongsan and the river, the North Koreans controlled the high ground. The US 2nd Infantry Division now had to base its defense of Yongsan on relatively poor defensive terrain, the low hills at <b>the</b> western edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town.|$|R
5|$|That morning, September 5, after a 10-minute {{artillery}} preparation, the American troops {{moved out}} in their third day of counterattack. It was a day <b>of</b> rain. As <b>the</b> attack progressed, the marines approached Obong-ni Ridge and the 9th Infantry neared Cloverleaf Hill where they had fought tenaciously during <b>the</b> First <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Naktong <b>Bulge</b> <b>the</b> month before. There, at midmorning, on the high ground ahead, they could see North Korean troops digging in. The marines approached the pass between the two hills and took positions in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Korean-held high ground.|$|R
5|$|By this time, the US 2nd Infantry Division {{suffered}} 1,120 killed, 2,563 wounded, 67 {{captured and}} 69 missing during its time at Pusan Perimeter. This included about 180 casualties it suffered during <b>the</b> First <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Naktong <b>Bulge</b> <b>the</b> previous month. American forces were continually repulsed but {{able to prevent}} the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter. The division had numbered 17,498 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Pusan Perimeter, most of which probably occurred at Yongsan.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge,</b> a German counteroffensive during World War II, {{starting}} December 16, 1944, {{was marked}} by heavy snowstorms that hampered allied air support for ground troops, but also impaired German attempts to supply their front lines. On the Eastern Front with the Nazi invasion of Russia in 1941, Operation Barbarossa, both Russian and German soldiers had to endure terrible conditions during the Russian winter. While use of ski infantry was common in the Red Army, Germany formed only one division for movement on skis.|$|E
5|$|The M21 {{served on}} the Western Front, seeing action in Normandy and in {{southern}} France, before later being used during the <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge,</b> the Battle of Belgium, Operation Market Garden, and the invasion of Germany from the west. The M21 served with the US 3rd, 1st, and 7th Armies during the campaign in France, and the 2nd Armored Division, which developed it. In addition, 57 examples were leased to Free French forces. By 1945, it was declared obsolete, due to the insufficient power of the 81mm mortar as an artillery piece.|$|E
5|$|Under Patton, the Third Army {{landed in}} Normandy during July 1944 and {{would go on}} to play an {{integral}} role in the last months of the war in Europe, closing the Falaise Pocket in mid-August, and playing the key role in relieving the siege of Bastogne during the <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge</b> in December, a feat {{regarded as one of the}} most notable achievements in the war. The rapid offensive action and speed that Patton called for in the speech became actions which brought the Third Army wide acclaim in the campaign.|$|E
50|$|After World War II the 108th FA Battalion was reorganized with {{elements}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 108th FA Battalion and HHB 193rd FA Group in November 1946. The 193rd FA Battalion (former 1st Battalion 108th FA) was redsignated as the 235th FA Observation Battalion. Once again however, peace was shattered when in early June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea. The 28th Infantry Division and the 108th {{were sent to}} Camp Atterbury, Indiana, and later, Germany. The 235th was activated and sent to Fort Sill OK prior to shipping to Korea. The 235th arrived in Korea during <b>the</b> winter <b>of</b> 1953 and {{was assigned to the}} Eighth Army. The 235th served with II Corps, Republic of Korea's army during <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Komsung <b>Bulge.</b> For its actions Battery C earned a letter <b>of</b> commendation from <b>the</b> commander <b>of</b> II Corps ROK and the ROK Army Chief of Staff. They were also awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation by General Taylor, Commander of UN Forces in Korea, and two campaign streamers.|$|R
50|$|When the North Koreans {{approached}} the Pusan Perimeter on 5 August, they attempted the same frontal assault technique {{on the four}} main avenues <b>of</b> approach into <b>the</b> perimeter. Throughout August, their military conducted direct assaults resulting in <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Masan, <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Battle</b> Mountain, <b>the</b> First <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Naktong <b>Bulge,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Taegu, and <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bowling Alley. On <b>the</b> east coast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Korean Peninsula, the South Koreans repulsed three North Korean divisions at <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> P'ohang-dong. <b>The</b> North Korean attacks stalled as U.N. forces, well equipped and with large reserve units to draw upon, repeatedly repelled them. All along the front, the North Korean troops reeled from these defeats, {{the first time in}} the war North Korean tactics had failed.|$|R
5000|$|On 24 October 1944, Priess succeeded Georg Keppler as {{commander}} of I SS Panzer Corps. He led this formation, as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 6th Panzer Army, in the failed Ardennenoffensive, which was dubbed <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bulge.</b> <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> offensive was {{to split the}} British and American line in half, so the Germans could then proceed to encircle and destroy four Allied armies, forcing the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty with the Axis Powers. Subordinated to I SS Panzer Corps was Kampfgruppe [...] "Peiper", led by Joachim Peiper. Peiper's command {{was responsible for the}} Malmedy massacre, a war crime in which 84 American prisoners of war were murdered by their German captors near Malmedy, Belgium.|$|R
