5|$|Despite {{his success}} in winning the war, William had far less success in {{restoring}} royal power following the peace. In part, this was because William was unable to offer significant patronage, despite the expectations from the loyalist barons {{that they would be}} rewarded. William attempted to enforce the traditional rights of the Crown to approve marriages and wardships, but with little success. Nonetheless, William was able to reconstitute the royal <b>bench</b> <b>of</b> <b>judges</b> and reopen the royal exchequer. The government issued the Charter of the Forest, which attempted to reform the royal governance of the forests. The regency and Llywelyn came to agreement on the Treaty of Worcester in 1218, but its generous terms – Llywelyn became effectively Henry's justiciar across Wales – underlined the weakness of the English Crown.|$|E

500|$|On 22 July 2015 the Supreme Court of Pakistan {{suspended}} Bibi's {{death sentence}} {{for the duration}} of the appeals process. In November 2015, Bibi's lead attorney, Naeem Shakir, announced that, after two postponements in 2015, the Lahore High Court would hear an appeal in Bibi's case on 26 March 2016. The hearing was rescheduled for 13 October 2016, but on that morning when it was the turn of the case [...] "Asia Bibi against the state", one of the three members of the <b>bench</b> <b>of</b> <b>judges</b> of that section -Iqbal Hameedur Rehman- refused to be part of the bench, which led to the postponement of the hearing to an undetermined date. The Judge later resigned in a handwritten letter addressed to Mamnoon Hussain, the President of Pakistan, without stating any specific reasons for his resignation. On 26 April 2017, chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar declined a request for the hearing of the case of Asia Bibi in the first week of June made by her Muslim lawyer Saiful Malook.|$|E

60|$|Burlington, {{home of the}} {{sparkling}} Burdette, is another hill city; and also a beautiful one; unquestionably so; a fine and flourishing city, {{with a population of}} twenty-five thousand, and belted with busy factories of nearly every imaginable description. It was a very sober city, too--for the moment--for a most sobering bill was pending; a bill to forbid the manufacture, exportation, importation, purchase, sale, borrowing, lending, stealing, drinking, smelling, or possession, by conquest, inheritance, intent, accident, or otherwise, in the State of Iowa, of each and every deleterious beverage known to the human race, except water. This measure was approved by all the rational people in the State; but not by the <b>bench</b> <b>of</b> <b>Judges.</b>|$|E
60|$|How many a man {{lives and}} dies without giving any sign whether he be an arrant coward, or a true-hearted, brave hero! One {{would have said}} of this man, a year since, that he was brave enough. He would stand up before a <b>bench</b> <b>of</b> <b>judges,</b> with the bar of England round him, and shout forth, with brazen trumpet, things that were true, or things that were not true; {{striking}} down a foe here to the right, and slaughtering another there to the left, in a manner which, for so young a man, filled beholders with admiration. He could talk by the hour among the Commons of England, and no touch of modesty would ever encumber his speech. He could make himself great, by making others little, with a glance. But, for all that, he was a coward. Misfortune had come upon him, and he was conquered at once.|$|E
60|$|He had now fully made up {{his mind}} to go into the church. While yet {{thinking}} of high academical honours, and the brighter paths of ambition, he also had dreamed of the bar. All young men I believe do, who have high abilities, a taste for labour, and scanty fortune. Senior wranglers and double-firsts, when not possessed of means for political life, usually find their way to the bar. It is on the <b>bench</b> <b>of</b> <b>judges,</b> not on the bench of bishops, that we must look for them in after life. Arthur, therefore, had thought of the joys of a Chancery wig, and had looked forward eagerly to fourteen hours' daily labour in the purlieus of Lincoln's Inn. But when, like many another, he found himself disappointed in his earliest hopes, he consoled himself by thinking that after all the church was the safer haven. And when he walked down to West Putford there was one there who told him that it was so.|$|E

6000|$|This trial was, as {{has been}} said, a [...] "causa publica," [...] a {{criminal}} accusation of such importance as to demand {{that it should be}} tried before a full <b>bench</b> <b>of</b> <b>judges.</b> Of these the number would be uncertain, but they were probably above fifty. The Prætor of the day--the Prætor to whom by lot had fallen for that year that peculiar duty--presided, and the judges all sat round him. Their duty seems to have consisted in listening to the pleadings, and then in voting. Each judge could vote[74] [...] "guilty," [...] "acquitted," [...] or [...] "not proven," [...] as they do in Scotland. They were, in fact, jurymen rather than judges. It does not seem that any amount of legal lore was looked for specially in the judges, who at different periods had been taken from various orders of the citizens, but who at this moment, by a special law enacted by Sulla, were selected only from the Senators. We have ample evidence that at this period the judges in Rome were most corrupt. They were tainted by a double corruption: that of standing by their order instead of standing by the public--each man among them feeling that his turn to be accused might come--and that also of taking direct bribes. Cicero on various occasions--on this, for instance, and notably in the trial of Verres, to which we shall come soon--felt very strongly that his only means of getting a true verdict from the majority of judges was to frighten them into temporary honesty by the magnitude of the occasion. If a trial could be slurred through with indifferent advocates, with nothing to create public notice, with no efforts of genius to attract admiration, and a large attendance and consequent sympathy the judgment would, as a matter of course, be bought. In such a case as this of Sextus Roscius, the poor wretch would be condemned, sewed up in his bag, and thrown into the sea, a portion of the plunder would be divided among the judges, and nothing further would be said about it. But if an orator could achieve for himself such a reputation that the world would come and listen to him, if he could so speak that Rome should be made to talk about the trial, then might the judges be frightened into a true verdict. It may be understood, therefore, of what importance it was to obtain the services of a Cicero, or of a Hortensius, who was unrivalled at the Roman bar when Cicero began to plead.|$|E
