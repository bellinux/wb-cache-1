2500|$|The {{result of}} the trip to Las Vegas became the 1972 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which first {{appeared}} in the November 1971 issues of Rolling Stone as a two-part series. It is written as a first-person account by a journalist named Raoul Duke on a trip to Las Vegas with Dr. Gonzo, his [...] "300-pound Samoan attorney", to cover a narcotics officers' convention and the [...] "fabulous Mint 400". During the trip, Duke and his companion (always referred to as [...] "my attorney") become sidetracked by a search for the American Dream, with [...] "two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered <b>blotter</b> <b>acid,</b> a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls." ...|$|E
50|$|We had {{two bags}} of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered <b>blotter</b> <b>acid,</b> a salt shaker half full of cocaine, {{and a whole}} galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls.... Not that we needed all that for the trip, {{but once you get}} locked into a serious drug collection, the {{tendency}} is to push it as far as you can.The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge.|$|E

5000|$|Holland Cotter, {{art critic}} for the New York Times wrote in 2002, [...] "Alex Grey's art, with its New Age {{symbolism}} and medical-illustration finesse, {{might be described as}} psychedelic realism, a kind of clinical approach to cosmic consciousness. In it, the human figure is rendered transparently with X-ray or CAT-scan eyes, the way Aldous Huxley saw a leaf when he was on mescaline. Every bone, organ and vein is detailed in refulgent color; objects and space are knitted together in dense, decorative linear webs." [...] Grey's paintings have been featured in venues as diverse as the album art of Tool, The String Cheese Incident, Meshuggah, the Beastie Boys and Nirvana, Newsweek magazine, the Discovery Channel, Rave flyers and sheets of <b>blotter</b> <b>acid.</b> His work has been exhibited worldwide, including Feature Inc., Tibet House, Stux Gallery, P.S. 1, The Outsider Art Fair and the New Museum in NYC, the Grand Palais in Paris, the Sao Paulo Biennial in Brazil.|$|E
50|$|After auditioning {{at least}} a dozen {{potential}} bass players, they finally found Joe Raposo through an advertisement. An audition was set up for Raposo by a friend. Raposo became the bass player for RKL in time for touring support of RocK 'n Roll Nightmare. In 1988, RKL toured Europe in support of the new album where it was particularly well received. A live album was recorded in West Berlin at Quartier Latin (now Wintergarten Variet√©) on July 9, 1988. It was entitled Greatest Hits Double Live and released on Destiny Records. It was the first RKL album on CD in addition to the common vinyl and cassette formats. The artwork of the album is a collection of <b>blotter</b> <b>acid</b> paper of varying size, image, and age contributed by Mark McCloud, famous for his extensive collection which he calls the Institute of Illegal Images. Due to Raposo's status as a minor (he was only seventeen), his parents, though less than enthusiastic, gave permission for him to leave the country. Ward was named temporary guardian for the European tour. The signed guardianship papers are included in the Greatest Hits Double Live artwork.|$|E
5000|$|Led by Tad Doyle (b. Thomas Andrew Doyle) on vocals and guitar, Tad {{was formed}} in early 1988 by Doyle, a drummer turned guitar player/singer, who asked bassist Kurt Danielson to play bass for the band. Danielson's band Bundle of Hiss played with Doyle's {{previous}} band (in which he played drums) H-Hour. Tad recruited drummer Steve Wied (formerly of Skin Yard and Death and Taxes) and guitarist Gary Thorstensen (ex-Treeclimbers) to complete the original lineup. Tad {{was among the first}} bands to be signed to the independent label Sub Pop Records. In 1988, Doyle had released the [...] "Daisy/Ritual Device" [...] single on Sub Pop, produced by seminal Seattle producer Jack Endino, for which Doyle wrote and performed all music. Tad's debut album God's Balls appeared in early 1989 and was also produced by Endino. In March 1990 the band released the Salt Lick EP, recorded by Steve Albini. The single [...] "Wood Goblins" [...] was released in the same year, but was apparently banned by MTV. After a European tour with Nirvana, Tad returned to Seattle and recorded their second album 8-Way Santa (1991), named after a type of <b>blotter</b> <b>acid.</b> Produced by famed '90s grunge and alternative producer Butch Vig (better known for Nirvana's Nevermind, Smashing Pumpkins's Siamese Dream and as drummer for the band Garbage), the album was far more pop-oriented than its predecessors, featuring such songs as [...] "Jinx," [...] "Stumblin' Man" [...] and [...] "Jack Pepsi." ...|$|E
