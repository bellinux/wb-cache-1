5000|$|An osteotome is an {{instrument}} used for cutting or preparing bone. Osteotomes {{are similar to}} a chisel but <b>bevelled</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> sides. They are used today in plastic surgery, orthopedic surgery and dental implantation.|$|R
50|$|Stone chisels {{are used}} to carve or cut stone, bricks or {{concrete}} slabs. To cut, as opposed to carve, a brick bolster is used; this has a wide, flat blade that is tapped along the cut line to produce a groove, then hit hard in the centre to crack the stone. Sculptors use a spoon chisel, which is bent, with the <b>bevel</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> sides. To increase the force, stone chisels are often hit with club hammers, a heavier type of hammer.|$|R
50|$|Leaves are opposite, simple, entire wavy margins, smooth, lanceolate, pointed, {{gradually}} tapering to the base. 8 to 15 cm long, 2 to 4 cm broad.

40|$|The impact {{dynamics}} of water droplets on an artificial dual-scaled superhydrophobic surface was studied and {{compared with that}} of a lotus leaf with impact velocity V up to 3 m/s. The lower critical impact velocity for the bouncing of droplets was about 0. 08 m/s <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>surfaces.</b> At relatively low impact velocities, regular rebound of droplets and air bubble trapping and flow jetting <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>surfaces</b> were observed as V was increased. For intermediate V, partial pinning and rebound of droplets were found on the artificial dual-scaled surface due to the penetration of the droplets into the micro- and nano-scale roughness. On the lotus leaf, however, the droplets bounced off with intensive vibrations instead of being partially pinned on the surface because of the irregular distribution of microbumps on the leaf. As the impact velocity was sufficiently high, droplet splashing occurred <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The contact time and restitution coefficient of the impinging droplets were also measured and discussed.
