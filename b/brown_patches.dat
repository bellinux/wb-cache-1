5|$|The floury baker's {{distinctive}} {{appearance and}} loud call make it popular with children. Both the common and genus name {{are derived from}} the white, flour-like filaments covering the adult body. Its body and eyes are generally brown with pale patterns including a light-coloured line along the midline of the pronotum. Its forewings have distinctive dark <b>brown</b> <b>patches</b> {{at the base of}} two of their apical cells. The female is larger than the male, although species size overall varies geographically, with larger animals associated with regions of higher rainfall. The male has distinctive genitalia and a loud and complex call generated by the frequent buckling of ribbed tymbals and amplified by abdominal air sacs.|$|E
5|$|Dying {{stands of}} B. coccinea were {{observed}} in 1989, and the fungus Cryptodiaporthe melanocraspedia isolated as the cause in 1995. The disease, a form of aerial canker, manifested initially as dead dry brown leaves and the tips of new growth. Plants would die from the top downwards, with larger branches affected over time. Under the outer bark, orange and <b>brown</b> <b>patches</b> of necrosis spread out from leaf nodes until they encircle the stem, which then dies. Flower spikes may be affected during flowering season. In humid spells during warm weather, white or pink spore tendrils are produced on dead wood. One affected stand monitored over three years from October 1989 to June 1992 showed a 97% mortality of plants (compared with a baseline 40%). Investigators Bryan Shearer and colleagues isolated another virulent pathogen that they identified as a species of Zythiostroma, however it appeared to invoke an immune response in the plant. This immune response, coupled {{with the fact that}} it had not been observed in the wild, led them to believe it was not a major pathogen of the species. This species has since been reclassified and named as Luteocirrhus shearii.|$|E
25|$|In the A. ischnosoma species group, {{variation}} in colouration {{is restricted to}} the dorsal surface of the head, which ranges from light to chocolate brown. The body colouration is less variable. In A. ischnosoma, a series of longitudinal chocolate <b>brown</b> <b>patches</b> arranged to form a faintly reticulate pattern is present in all specimens observed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>patch</b> is a turfgrass {{disease that}} {{is caused by}} the Rhizoctonia species fungus. This turfgrass disease is most common <b>Brown</b> <b>patch</b> can be found in all of the cool season turfgrasses found in the United States. <b>Brown</b> <b>patch</b> is most devastating to: Bentgrass (Agrostis sp.), {{ryegrass}} (Lolium sp.), Annual bluegrass (Poa annua), and Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea). [...] <b>Brown</b> <b>patch</b> is also found in Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) and Fine fescue (Festuca sp.) but this is rare or does minimal damage. <b>Brown</b> <b>patch</b> is known as a foliar disease, so it does not have any effect on the crown or roots of the turf plant.|$|R
40|$|This NebGuide {{describes}} the symptoms and disease cycle of <b>brown</b> <b>patch</b> and gives recommendations for its prevention and control through management, including use of fungicides. <b>Brown</b> <b>patch</b> of turfgrass {{is caused by}} the fungus Rhizoctonia solani Kuehn. All commonly cultivated turfgrasses in Nebraska are affected by this disease, but differences in susceptibility exist within cultivars of the various turfgrass species. Primary hosts are bentgrass, perennial ryegrass, tall fescue and annual bluegrass. Certain species of Rhizoctonia are capable of attacking turfgrass plants from seedling stage to mature plants and are pathogenic over a wide range of environmental conditions.

25|$|An initial {{batch of}} desert BDUs {{in the new}} {{camouflage}} scheme was {{en route to the}} Middle East when hostilities ceased. The pattern, officially issued with the newer Desert Camouflage Uniform (DCU) in the early 1990s, consisted of a subtle blend of large pastel green and light tan shapes, with sparsely placed, narrow, reddish <b>brown</b> <b>patches,</b> leading the design to be unofficially nicknamed the “Coffee Stain” pattern.|$|E

25|$|A. guttatus {{is easily}} {{differentiated}} from {{other members of}} the A. ischnosoma group by a slender (vs. moderately thick) humeral process (maximum width 10.011.8% its length vs. 13.218.4). A. mahakamensis is differentiated from other members of its group by a rounded (vs. angular) anterior margin of the anal fin, and a more slender body. A. septentrionalis can be differentiated by members of the A. ischnoma group by a smaller dorsal to adipose distance (4.45.7% standard length vs. 6.29.8), fewer branchiostegal rays (4 vs. 56) and an almost uniformly cream colour pattern with few very small brown spots (vs. a variegated colour pattern with numerous <b>brown</b> <b>patches).</b> A. strigosus can be differentiated from members of the A. ischnosoma species group by a rounded (vs. angular) posterior margin of the adipose fin and a more slender body; the genital papilla in male A. strigosus is also morphologically different from other members of its species group (short and thick vs. long and thin). A. ischnosoma is distinguished from {{other members of the}} A. ischnosoma group by a greater distance between the dorsal fin and adipose fin (9.010.1% SL vs. 4.48.7) and a greater exposure of the premaxillary teeth when the mouth is closed (one-third vs. less than one-fifth to none). A. gyrinus can be distinguished from its congeners by a concave posterior margin of the pectoral fin.|$|E

500|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} {{measures}} [...] {{in length}} and weighs [...] The adult male has white underparts with a black throat, face and flanks. The upperparts are deep blue. The immature male is similar, but with greener upperparts. The female has olive-brown upperparts and light yellow underparts with darker wings and tail, gray crown and <b>brown</b> <b>patches</b> on the cheek. Both sexes have a thin pointed bill and small white wing patches which are not always visible. Like many other warbler species, it has colorful plumage during the spring and summer. However, outside the breeding season its plumage is drab and less distinctive. In the fall, the black-throated blue warbler can be distinguished by its small white wing patches. Juveniles have brown upperparts with a creamy supercilium and brownish spots on the throat, the breast and the belly.|$|E
2500|$|Jim Martell, {{a hunter}} from Idaho, found and shot a grizzly–polar bear hybrid near Sachs Harbour on Banks Island, Northwest Territories {{reportedly}} on 16 April 2006. Martell had been hunting for polar bears with an official license and a guide, {{at a cost}} of $45,450, and killed the animal believing it to be a normal polar bear. Officials took interest in the creature after noticing that while it had thick, creamy white fur typical of polar bears, it also had long claws, a humped back, a shallow face, and <b>brown</b> <b>patches</b> around its eyes, nose, back, and foot, which are all traits of grizzly bears. [...] If the bear had been adjudicated to be a grizzly, the hunter would have faced a possible CAN$1,000 fine and up to a year in jail.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2014, the Army unofficially {{announced}} that the Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP) would replace UCP on the Army Combat Uniform. The original [...] "Scorpion" [...] pattern was developed at United States Army Soldier Systems Center by Crye Precision in 2002 for the Objective Force Warrior program. Crye later modified and trademarked their version of the pattern as MultiCam, which was selected for use by U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan in 2010. After talks to officially adopt MultiCam broke down over costs in late 2013, the Army began experimenting with the original Scorpion pattern, creating a variant code named [...] "Scorpion W2", noting that while a pattern can be copyrighted, a color palette cannot and that beyond 50 meters the actual pattern is [...] "not that relevant." [...] The pattern resembles MultiCam with muted greens, light beige, and dark brown colors, but uses fewer beige and <b>brown</b> <b>patches</b> and no vertical twig and branch elements. On 31 July 2014, the Army formally {{announced that}} the pattern would begin being issued in uniforms in summer 2015. The official name is intended to emphasize its use beyond Afghanistan to all combatant commands, with a family of versions including a dark jungle-woodland variant and a lighter pattern for deserts to follow. The UCP pattern is planned to be fully replaced by the OCP on the ACU by 1 October 2019. ACUs printed in OCP first became available for purchase on 1 July 2015, with deployed soldiers already being issued uniforms and equipment in the new pattern.|$|E

60|$|The dog {{heard his}} name {{pronounced}} {{through the open}} door. The next moment he trotted into the drawing-room with Isabel's pocketbook in his mouth.

As he reached {{the middle of the}} room, and looked from one to another of the persons present, the fine sympathy of his race told him that there was trouble among his human friends. His tail dropped; he whined softly as he approached Isabel, and laid her pocketbook at her feet.|$|E
60|$|Wondering {{what this}} might mean, I sat very still, and then stared blankly, as a snow-whitened object came softly into the room. For {{a few seconds}} I could almost have fancied it was a supernatural visitant rather than a {{creature}} of flesh and blood, for the man's face was ghastly, and he brought {{the chill of the}} grave with him. He was bareheaded, his cheeks ashy gray, and clotted <b>brown</b> <b>patches</b> streaked the rag bound round his forehead, while the snow was in his hair; but as he moved forward I had no difficulty in recognizing him. I heard Lucille Haldane draw in her breath with a gasp, and it was that which roused me to action, but the intruder broke the silence first.|$|E

60|$|That gradual {{passage of}} town into country through an {{extensive}} sponge of suburbs, {{which was so}} characteristic {{a feature of the}} great cities of the nineteenth century, existed no longer.

60|$|With a long {{sweep of}} the paddle she ran the canoe {{alongside}} a stone beneath a great tree which spread its long branches over the creek and shaded the pool. It was a grand old tree and must have guarded that sylvan spot for centuries. The gnarled and knotted trunk was scarred and seamed with the ravages of time. The upper part was dead. Long limbs extended skyward, gaunt and bare, like the masts of a storm beaten vessel. The lower branches were white and shining, relieved here and there by <b>brown</b> <b>patches</b> of bark which curled up like old parchment as they shelled away from the inner bark. The ground beneath the tree was carpeted with a velvety moss with little plots of grass and clusters of maiden-hair fern growing on it.

June, and the desert found its analogy only in the sweep and reach! A thousand hills billowing away toward that blue haze of mountain range where rolled the Oregon. Acreage and mileage seemed insignificant. All was green--green, the fresh and hopeful color, strangely serene and sweet and endless under the azure sky. Beautiful and lonely hills they were, eloquent of toil, expressive with the brown squares in the green, the lowly homes of men, the long lines of roads running everywhither, overwhelmingly pregnant with meaning--wheat--wheat--wheat--nothing but wheat, a staggering visual manifestation of vital need, of noble promise.|$|E
