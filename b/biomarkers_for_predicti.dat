Although various recommendations, such as identifying cases based on clinical symptoms, keeping biomarker tests simple, and adjusting for postscreening noise, have been made previously, they are not widely known.

40|$|Biomarkers {{have been}} sought after {{in the field}} of {{schizophrenia}} research for decades. In this paper, we discuss some of the concepts around developing biomarkers in an effort to understand why the use of <b>biomarkers</b> <b>for</b> schizophrenia has not been realized. In particular, we address the following 4 questions. Why would we need a diagnostic <b>biomarker</b> <b>for</b> schizophrenia? How is a biomarker typically defined and how does that influence the discovery of biomarkers in schizophrenia? What is the best use of biomarkers in schizophrenia? Do any <b>biomarkers</b> <b>for</b> schizophrenia currently exist? Thus, while we suggest that no <b>biomarker</b> currently exists <b>for</b> schizophrenia, the heterogeneity associated with schizophrenia will most likely need {{to be taken into account}} which will result in multiple biomarkers that identify the multiple underlying pathophysiological processes involved in schizophrenia. Therefore, much additional work will be required prior to obtaining any well-established <b>biomarkers</b> <b>for</b> schizophrenia...|$|R

40|$|Background: Current diagnostic, {{prognostic}} {{and risk}} stratification tools are inadequate for effective ischaemic stroke management. Hypothesising that –omics approaches {{can be used}} to detect novel candidate <b>biomarkers</b> <b>for</b> ischaemic stroke, this thesis aimed to evaluate the current status of <b>biomarkers</b> <b>for</b> ischaemic stroke and develop strategies <b>for</b> <b>biomarker</b> discovery. Methods: Systematic literature review and individual patient data meta-analyses were performed to assess current candidate biomarkers associated with ischaemic stroke. Proteomic SELDI-TOF MS profiling was undertaken to identify novel blood-based protein <b>biomarkers</b> <b>for</b> the diagnosis of acute ischaemic stroke, consisting of a pilot study and a subsequent well-powered discovery study of 104 patients. In an integrative genomics study, transcriptomics data from carotid endarterectomy samples was combined with a genome-wide association study meta-analysis and subjected to functional enrichment analysis to detect differential gene expression or alternative splicing profiles that may be under the control of a genetic variant. Results: Systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that no current candidate biomarkers could be recommended for routine clinical practice, supporting the pursuit of novel <b>biomarkers</b> <b>for</b> ischaemic stroke and informing the design of subsequent experimental studies. SELDI-TOF MS detected two plasma protein ions, m/z 3699 and m/z 6640, which could differentiate between acute cerebral ischaemia and stroke mimics. Protein ion m/z 6640, identified as ApoC 1, highlighted the role of lipid dysregulation and was postulated to be a novel candidate <b>biomarker</b> <b>for</b> acute cerebral ischaemia. Integrative genomics provided evidence for the genetic regulation of cytoskeletal organisation and extracellular matrix remodelling processes in carotid disease. The LTBP 4 gene was found to be a candidate risk <b>biomarker</b> <b>for</b> ischaemic stroke by predicting plaque instability and rupture. Conclusions: This work provides workflows <b>for</b> successful <b>biomarker</b> discovery using innovative –omics approaches, highlights key pathogenic pathways and identifies novel candidate <b>biomarkers</b> <b>for</b> ischaemic stroke diagnosis and risk stratification.
