40|$|Abstract Draw beads {{are used}} in sheet metal forming {{processes}} to regulate material flow and achieve higher quality in the parts. The draw beads impose draw restraining force on the blank which eliminates defects such as wrinkling, tearing and reduces springback. In a draw-bend test, the draw restraining force is imitated by the <b>back</b> <b>force</b> applied through a hydraulic ram. As the <b>back</b> <b>force</b> increases, large strain is induced which reduces springback tendency. This study evaluates the influence of <b>back</b> <b>force</b> on the springback behavior in advanced high strength steel (AHSS). Three grades of dual-phase steel, namely DP 600, DP 800, DP 980, are used with normalized back forces ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 1. The springback decreases as the <b>back</b> <b>force</b> increases.

The BUT has been extensively applied, in the literature, to relatively thin (1 mm and thinner) sheet metals for automotive applications; the applicability of several guidelines from the literature was investigated in this work in the context of thick advanced high strength steel (AHSS) sheets and using a sample width of 12 mm. The monotonic decrease of springback as <b>back</b> <b>force</b> increased was confirmed for this category of sheet steels, and a general trend for the non-linear influence of the tool radius was observed.

40|$|Abstract—The {{inhibiting}} eect of vacancies on {{the very}} process {{in which they are}} generated is considered from a thermodynamic viewpoint. Examples of such processes treated here in some detail are grain growth and pore dissolution. It is shown that these processes are inhibited due to vacancy generation. A particular scenario discussed implies intermittent ‘‘locking’’. After a period of uninhibited kinetics the process comes to a halt due to a thermodynamic <b>back</b> <b>force</b> ‘‘locking’ ’ it. It can only re-start once the vacancies produced are removed by diusion. This repetitive cycle leads to an overall reduction in the rate of the kinetic pro-cess in question. Specific predictions with regard to grain growth in fine-grained (particularly nanocrystal-line) materials and void dissolution kinetics in sintering are made. A third example considered is vacancy drag on a moving individual grain boundary. The magnitude of the drag is re-assessed by taking int...|$|E
40|$|A {{new concept}} of {{incremental}} equal channel angular pressing (I-ECAP) with converging billets is proposed and simulated numerically. It follows a recently introduced process of ECAP with converging billets, {{in which the}} contact surface between converging billets plays the same role as a movable die wall in the output channel of classical ECAP and thus reduces friction and the process force. The process productivity is doubled and material pickup, especially problematic in the output channel, avoided. However, ECAP with converging billets, as any ECAP-based process, suffers from a limited length of the billets it can process. This paper proposes an incremental version of ECAP with converging billets, which enables processing very long billets. Additionally, a new option for ECAP or I-ECAP with converging billets is considered, which assumes their separation with a movable tool. This tool {{can also be used}} to apply a <b>back</b> <b>force.</b> FEM simulations of all these processes enable their comparison in terms of strain distribution and the force required...|$|E

The treatment was associated with an immediate sustained increase in seat belt compliance to 100 %. Occasionally, drivers initially did not buckle during a trip and encountered the force. In all instances, they buckled within less than 25  s. These results suggest that the increased force was sufficient to set up an establishing operation to reinforce seat belt buckling negatively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to assess the {{pressure}} distribution responses to three hour seating bouts in a standard car seat condition compared to a Comfort Motion Technology (CMT) car seat condition. Twelve males participated in the study. Subjects came in for two separate sessions no more than one week apart. Pressure distribution on the backrest and seat pan was assessed in a three hour seating bout. Pressure variables associated with increased seating comfort were collected across six distinct 28 minute cycles and then averaged across these six cycles. The pressure variables were contact area, peak contact pressure, and force. The CMT car seat condition exhibited greater back contact area (p=. 003) and less back peak pressure (p=. 003) than the standard car seat condition. In addition, the CMT car seat condition had greater seat peak pressure (p<. 001) and greater <b>back</b> <b>force</b> (p<. 001) than the standard car seat condition.

40|$|The {{pull back}} {{operation}} {{is the most}} important stage of horizontal directional drilling (HDD). The cost of jammed pipelines, damaged pipelines and the costs for additional measures during and after the pull back operation can be considerable. Recently in the Netherlands several problems occurred during the pull back operation at some locations where relatively large diameter pipelines where installed. The objective of the Delft Cluster Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) project, is to find a detailed method for modelling the pulling of pipelines through a borehole created using HDD’s. The main objective is to get {{a better understanding of the}} behaviour of the pipeline in the borehole. Penetration of the borehole wall during the pullback operation and friction in between the pipe and the borehole are important parameters. The current Dutch method for calculating the pull <b>back</b> <b>force</b> on the product pipe was developed more then 10 years ago. For global design purposes and global engineering practice it is a quick and relative simple method which gives a reasonable estimate of the maximum pull <b>back</b> <b>force.</b> But large differences with field measurements have also been observed, hence a more detailed analysis of the processes occurring in the soil-pipe interaction during the pullback operation is required. Such analysis has been made from which a new model for the pull back operation is developed. In this report first the various processes occurring during pull back are described in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3 the model is presented, what elements are included in the model, what processes they describe. Chapter 4 presents pull back simulation results for a variety of cases, from simple to extensive. Simple cases are used to compare the model to analytical solutions, and to compare geometrically linear to nonlinear behaviour. More detailed cases include more and more phenomena and processes. The complexity is increased gradually to better understand the influence of various parameters. Chapter 5 presents conclusions that can be drawn from the simulations. In Chapter 6 a study is presented that investigates the soil-pipe interaction behaviour for various combinations of pipe dimensions and soil types. From this study a better understanding is obtained for the behaviour of soil springs in pipe-soil interaction contact as used in the model. Chapter 7 gives some general conclusions about the model and the project, including suggestions for future research...|$|E

However, {{the way these}} processes affect the calving rate and glacier dynamics remains uncertain. In this study, we used a finite element-based model that solves the full Stokes equations to simulate {{the impact of these}} forcings on two-dimensional theoretical flow line glacier configurations. The model, which includes calving processes, suggests that frontal melting affects the position of the terminus only slightly (less than a few hundred metres) and does not affect the multiannual glacier mass balance at all. However, the ice mélange has a greater impact on the advance and retreat cycles of the glacier front (more than several kilometres) and its consequences for the mass balance are not completely negligible, stressing the need for better characterization of forcing properties. We also show that ice mélange forcing against the calving face can mechanically prevent crevasse propagation at sea level and hence prevent calving.

It is important to assess abdomen injury risk using a biofidelic crash test dummy, especially under seatbelt loading. A lumped element model has been used to simulate seatbelt and impactor loading cases on Post Mortem Human Subjects (PMHS) subject and on the THOR dummy. The model consists of two blocks of one spring and one damper with a mass between the blocks and a mass {{at the front of the}} model. The front block has the spring and damper in series, whereas they are in parallel for the rear block, to reproduce the abdomen and <b>back</b> <b>force</b> respectively. The mechanical parameters of the model have been optimised to fit the forcepenetration response of PMHS and of the dummy. The results show that the PMHS response is more damperdependent, whereas the dummy response is more springdependent. Moreover, unlike the PMHS, the THOR dummy model needs a nonlinear spring in order to fit the impactor test data. The conclusions are that the dummy abdomen should be modified to make it more viscously deformable and to include pelvis design modifications in order to prevent a too stiff response...|$|E
