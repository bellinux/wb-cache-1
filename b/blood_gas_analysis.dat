METHODS:This was an exploratory, descriptive and cross-sectional study with 26 newborns submitted to <b>blood</b> <b>gases</b> <b>analysis</b> and admitted to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Data were collected in April and May 2010, by means of an identification form and physiological changes presented by newborns before and during the procedure. RESULTS:There have been newborn facial manifestations of pain (100 %), heart rate changes (50 %) and decreased oxygen saturation (34. 7 %). CONCLUSION:When physiological parameters were compared before and during arterial puncture, there have been pain facial manifestations in all newborns as well as physiological changes such as decreased oxygen saturation levels and increased heart rate, according to the Neonatal Facial Activity Coding scale, showing that, although unable to verbalize, newborns are able to show changes expressing the pain felt at arterial puncture. The application of this scale was especially important for favoring sensitization and a holistic nursing care for painful newborns...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effects of {{pulmonary}} rehabilitation (PR) on six-minute walk test (6 mWT) between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with moderate or severe carbon monoxide diffusion defects. We also evaluated dyspnea sensation, pulmonary functions, <b>blood</b> <b>gases</b> <b>analysis,</b> quality of life parameters and psychological symptoms in both groups before and after pulmonary rehabilitation. MethodsPatients with COPD underwent a comprehensive 8 -week out-patient PR program participated in this study. Patients grouped according to diffusion capacity as moderate or severe. Outcome measures were exercise capacity (6 mWT), dyspnea sensation, pulmonary function tests, <b>blood</b> <b>gases</b> <b>analysis,</b> quality of life (QoL) and psychological symptoms. ResultsA total of 68 patients enrolled in the study. Thirty-two (47 %) of them had moderate diffusion defect [TlCO; 52 (47 – 61) mmol/kPa] and 36 (53 %) of them had severe diffusion defect [TlCO; 29 (22 – 34) mmol/kPa]. At the end of the program, PaO 2 (p= 0. 001), Modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (p= 0. 001), 6 mWT (p< 0. 001) and quality of life parameters improved significantly in both groups (p< 0. 05). Also the improvement in DlCO (p= 0. 04) value and FEV 1 % (p= 0. 01) reached a statistically significant level in patients with severe diffusion defect. When comparing changes between groups, dyspnea reduced significantly in patients with severe diffusion defect (p= 0. 04). ConclusionPulmonary rehabilitation improves oxygenation, severity of dyspnea, exercise capacity and quality of life independent of level of carbon monoxide diffusion capacity in patents with COPD.

30|$|Methods: We {{studied the}} {{cerebral}} perfusion during various modes of mechanical ventilation in 70 patients with STBI. Mean age was 32 [*]±[*] 5. The general status in admission was severe, Glasgow coma score was 7 [*]±[*] 3. All patients had traditional intensive care with different modes of respiratory support: {{controlled mechanical ventilation}} - CMV (n[*]=[*] 10); synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation - SIMV (n[*]=[*] 20); HFJV (n[*]=[*] 40). The efficacy of all modes were assessed by arterial <b>blood</b> <b>gases</b> <b>analysis</b> (SaO 2 - 96 - 99  %, pCO 2 - 34.7 - 35.2  mmHg). Intracranial pressure were measured invasively and was 20 [*]±[*] 5  mmHg. All patients regularly had clinical and neurological examination, control of laboratory tests (common blood count, arterial <b>blood</b> <b>gases,</b> arteriovenous gradient of O 2 (AVDO 2) and oxygen saturation in jugular vein (SjO 2). Cerebral hemodynamics was studied by transcranial dopplerography. The registered parameters were mean linear velocity of cerebral blood flow (Vm), pulsatile index (Pi) and overshoot coefficient (OC).|$|R
30|$|On {{arrival at}} the {{operating}} room, standard monitoring was applied consisting of ECG, pulse oximetry and temperature. Intravenous midazolam 0.03  mg/kg was administered. After Allen test and local anesthetic infiltration, a cannula was placed to the radial artery and arterial pressure was monitorized. Blood sampling was made for baseline arterial <b>blood</b> <b>gases</b> (ABG) <b>analysis</b> and for cortisol, insulin and glucose levels to assess the systemic stress response.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. In this paper, we {{aimed to}} present five Papaver rhoeas {{intoxication}} cases, {{which is very}} rare in the literature. Case 1. A 35 -year-old female patient was admitted to our emergency room with the complaints of nausea, restlessness, and dyspnea developing 3 hours after eating Papaver rhoeas. On physical examination, her general condition was moderate; she was conscious and the vital findings were normal. The pupils were myotic. She {{was transferred to the}} toxicology intensive care unit as she experienced a generalized tonic clonic seizure lasting for three minutes. Case 2. A 41 -year-old female patient was brought to our emergency room by 112 ambulance as she had contractions in her arms and legs, unconsciousness, and foam coming from her mouth two hours after Papaver rhoeas ingestion. On physical examination, she was confused, the pupils were myotic, and she was tachycardic. Arterial <b>blood</b> <b>gases</b> <b>analysis</b> revealed lactic acidosis. Case 3. A 38 -year-old female patient was admitted to our emergency room with complaints of nausea and vomiting two hours after ingestion of Papaver rhoeas. Her physical examination and tests were normal. Case 4. A 34 -year-old male patient was admitted to our emergency room with complaints of numbness and loss of power in his arms and legs one hour after Papaver rhoeas ingestion. He was hospitalized at the toxicology intensive care unit for follow-up and treatment. Dyspnea and bradycardia developed on the follow-up. The oxygen saturation without oxygen support was 90 %. ECG revealed sinus bradycardia. The cardiac enzymes did not increase. Case 5. A 42 -year-old female patient was brought to our emergency room by 112 ambulance with contractions in her arms and legs and unconsciousness two hours after Papaver rhoeas ingestion. On her physical examination, she was confused and the pupils were myotic. Arterial <b>blood</b> <b>gases</b> <b>analysis</b> revealed lactic acidosis. Conclusion. All patients were followed up for a few days and then discharged from the hospital with recovery. Unconscious consumption of Papaver rhoeas leads to a clinical condition resembling morphine intoxication, CNS depression, and epileptic seizures...|$|R
