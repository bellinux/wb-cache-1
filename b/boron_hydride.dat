These hydrides have an upper theoretical hydrogen yield limited to about 8.5% by weight. Amongst the compounds that contain only B, N, and H (both {{positive and negative}} ions), representative examples include: amine boranes, <b>boron</b> <b>hydride</b> ammoniates, hydrazine-borane complexes, and ammonium octahydrotriborates or tetrahydroborates. Of these, amine boranes (and especially ammonia borane) have been extensively investigated as hydrogen carriers. During the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. Army and Navy funded efforts aimed at developing hydrogen/deuterium gas-generating compounds {{for use in the}} HF/DF and HCl chemical lasers, and gas dynamic lasers. Earlier hydrogen gas-generating formulations used amine boranes and their derivatives. Ignition of the amine borane(s) forms boron nitride (BN) and hydrogen gas. In addition to ammonia borane ...|$|E

50|$|Stock began {{studying}} the <b>boron</b> <b>hydrides</b> - the <b>boron</b> hydrogen chemical compounds with general formula BxHy - since 1909 at Breslau. Due to their extreme reactivity and flammability in air, <b>boron</b> <b>hydrides</b> {{could not be}} purified until his development of methods for separation using high-vacuum manifolds around 1912. He performed similar work on the hydrides of silicon. The <b>hydrides</b> of <b>boron</b> and silicon represented the first family of binary compounds to approach the richness of hydrocarbons in terms of structural diversity. Not only did the <b>boron</b> <b>hydrides</b> exhibit challenging properties, their structures were also unusual. Elucidation of the structures and the associated bonding models dramatically expanded the scope of inorganic chemistry. <b>Boron</b> <b>hydrides</b> such as diborane later developed into a range of reagents for organic synthesis {{as well as a}} source of diverse ligands and building blocks for researchers.

We report a new strategy that is illustrated {{for the formation of}} magnesium <b>boron</b> <b>hydrides,</b> relevant compounds for instance for reversible solid state hydrogen storage. We started with small (5 - 10 nm) MgH 2 nanoparticles inside the ∼ 10 nm pores of a carbon scaffold, and larger MgH 2 crystallites on the exterior surface of the scaffold. The large difference in reactivity between the two types of MgH 2 is used to selective react the small MgH 2 particles inside the pores with B 2 H 6 to form magnesium <b>boron</b> <b>hydrides</b> under mild conditions. In this way pore-confined magnesium <b>boron</b> <b>hydrides</b> are formed with MgB 12 H 12 as the major phase. Hydrogen release from the confined magnesium <b>boron</b> <b>hydrides</b> starts just above the synthesis temperature of 120 °C. The addition of Ni brings about the reaction to proceed readily at temperatures as low as 30 °C. Furthermore, by Ni addition and tuning the synthesis temperature, the product distribution can be steered toward Mg(BH 4) 2 and other magnesium <b>boron</b> <b>hydrides.</b> This shows the suitability of our method to selectively form pore-confined complex metal hydrides, such as MgB 12 H 12 for which no synthesis strategy had been reported until now. This strategy might also be relevant for other novel energy storage and conversion materials, which are difficult to nanostructure in a controlled manner by conventional methods...|$|R

5000|$|In chemistry, boranes {{comprise}} {{a large group}} of the group 13 hydride compounds with the generic formula of BxHy.

The class is named after the parent chemical called [...] "borane" [...] itself, chemical formula BH3. This compound is only known to exist as a transient intermediate since it dimerises to form diborane, B2H6. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral. In addition to the charge-neutral boranes, a large number of anionic <b>boron</b> <b>hydrides</b> are known. The most important boranes are diborane B2H6 and two of its pyrolysis products, pentaborane B5H9 and decaborane B10H14.
