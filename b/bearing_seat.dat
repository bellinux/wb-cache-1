The pitting and partial broken teeth of gears are artificially made respectively as fault statuses, and the differences of acoustic images among normal and fault working states under the idling condition are analyzed. It can be found that the acoustic images of gearbox in three different situations change regularly, and the main sound sources can be recognized from the acoustic images which also contain rich diagnosis information.

40|$|An Assaying Balance {{from the}} First Halfof the 19 th Century at the University ofTartu History MuseumThe University of Tartu History Museum’s {{collection}} of older analytical balances also includes an assaying balance probably {{from the first}} half of the 19 th century. The balance belonged to the Tartu State University department of inorganic chemistry and was handed over to the historymuseum in 1982, where it was first displayed in the same year during the exhibition of science history commemorating the 350 th anniversary of the University of Tartu. According to the lore of the department the assaying balance had once belonged to Carl Ernst Heinrich Schmidt (1822 – 1894), who was once a chemistry professor at the University ofTartu and had worked for the University in 1847 – 1892. The balance is placed inside a birch wood box finished with red lacquer and with the measurements of 14. 0 x 24. 5 x 2. 7 cm. The balance is complete and in working order. Six of the lighter weights are missing from the set of milligram weights that should consist of 16 pieces by regulation. The largest weight is 1, 000 milligrams, the smallest was 0. 1 mg. Two small separate and gilded balance pans have alsosurvived. The balance is assembled on top of the box of the balance. The balance beam is 17. 8 cm long, the pointer of the balance is 8. 0 cm long. The steel knife-edge bearing of the balance beam is supported by the steel <b>bearing</b> <b>seat.</b> The pointer of the balance faces upward and reaches the dioptric needle. The back of the vane is covered with milk glass. The balance beam is made of brass, the pointer of steel. The diameter of the balance pans is 3. 3 cm and depth 0. 3 cm. The balance pans are suspended from three silk threads. The length of the silk thread from the balancepan to the fastening hook is 11. 0 cm. The balance is suspended from a lifting mechanism that enables to lift the balance up for the time of weighing. The  balance may be lifted and lowered with the aid of a string; one end of it is attached to the coil fastened to the top of the balance box from whence the string runs through two sheaves, whilethe other end is fastened to the lifting mechanism holding the balance. The balance is equipped with a damper that reduces vibration. The balance has been measured in detail so that it would be possible to compare it with other similar balances elsewhere. The forerunner of this balance type is W. F. Lingke, master at the Freiberg Mining Institute’s portable assaying balance made in 1827 (Harkort’s scale). The balance belongs to Harkort’s blowpipe kit along with other items necessary for analyses. A balance made somewhat later by the same master which is nearly identical but equipped with abalance damper is called Plattner’s scale and it is placed in a separate balance box. Both balances have a pointer and a vane with a needle facing upwards. The description and drawing of a scale with a balance damper were published in the first volume of K. F. Plattner’s monograph published in 1835 (Die Probierkunst mit dem Lötrohre). The third andcomplemented issue of Plattner’s monograph (1853) includes a drawing of a balance made by the same master, which shows that a significant change has been made to the construction of the balance: the scale pointer and vane with the needle are facing downwards. Balances made later by the same company (see Burchard, The History and Apparatusof Blowpipe Analysis) have downward-facing scale pointer and the needle of the vane is replaced with a scale with divisions. Proceeding from the changes in the construction of balances we may presume that our assaying balance, the pointer of which faces upwards and which has a vane, could have been made before 1853. The dimensions of our balance and Plattner’s scale practically coincide. This article provides an overview of the developmental history of assaying balances, using a selection of contemporary overviews on that subject as well as available and more important original sources pertaining to assaying balances for that purpose. The drawings, descriptions and other information on scales are based on Georgius Agricola’s De re metallica libri XII (seventh volume of the 1974 German publication); Lazarus Ercker’s Der grosse Probierbuch von 1580 and Johann Andrea Cramer’s Anfangsgründe der Probierkunst published in 1746 and 1794.

40|$|A {{recent study}} {{sponsored}} by the Association of American Railroads indicates that generally accepted practices for railroad bridge design produce structures that perform well in earthquakes. Shaking typically {{has not been a}} problem for railroad bridges in past earthquakes. Ground movements have caused most of the damage. Design elements such as massive rigid piers and stiff structures combined with simple spans, large <b>bearing</b> <b>seats,</b> and minimal skew have provided good performance in earthquakes. Some of these elements contrast with present highway bridge design practice. High live load design requirements compared to highway bridges, along with sound detailing practices help to provide earthquake resistant structures and explain why some design elements perform well for railroad bridges but are not used for highway bridges. Researchers constructed a database containing information about 3, 500 railway structures located in areas affected by earthquakes. The database includes structure data and estimated ground motion characteristics at structure locations based on earthquake ground motion records and other available data. In addition to quantifying damage sustained by railroad bridges (usually minimal), significant effort was placed on quantifying the number of bridges and the magnitude of the ground motion they sustained without damage. From these records, trends can be identified to note details that performed particularly well or poorly, which can be useful in the development of bridge seismic design and evaluation guidelines. This paper presents a summary of statistics and a review of bridge and detail performance under various seismic and soil conditions, along with recommendations for good seismic performance.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} controlling the vibration of rotating machines using active bearing seatings. Contributions have been in seven areas: test rig development, rotating machinery modelling, developing appropriate control laws, updating method for piezoelectric actuators, determining specifications for the actuators from FE models, modal correlation methods (with and without frequency weighting) and modal expansion. A rotating machine test rig has been designed and constructed. In this rig, an active <b>bearing</b> <b>seating</b> {{has been designed to}} accommodate two actuators, located orthogonally and exerting control forces at each of two bearings. The rig is a versatile unit- the first one {{of its kind in the}} UK having a rotor whose bearings are supported on active seatings. Determining the requirements for force, stroke and bandwidth of the actuators for bearing seatings begins with an accurate numerical model of the system. A displacement-based FE model incorporating the active <b>bearing</b> <b>seating</b> has been developed and applied for predicting the dynamic behaviour of a rotating machine. Both steady-state responses and transient responses (run-up / run-down) are considered. The model has been validated experimentally by performing an experimental modal analysis of the test rig. A third area is in the development of suitable control laws. The same numerical model developed for assessing the actuator specifications has been employed to develop the control strategy. A control algorithm has been developed for vibration suppression. In this, the core ideas of classical optimal control are adopted (namely trading-off control effort against tracking performance). The "Simplex" (Nelder- Mead) method has been applied. The optimisation study is carried out for collocated actuation and sensing and for the general case, non-collocated control. Synchronous vibration is minimized in a root mean squares sense. Numerical simulations have shown that the proposed optimal closed-loop control strategy is very effective in reducing the amplitude of the forced vibration under different operating conditions. This controller is easy to implement in practical applications. A complete experimental and computational characterisation has been carried out on the piezoelectric actuators. An experimental arrangement has been established to measure two frequency- response functions. From these the complete dynamic properties of the piezoelectric stack actuators can be determined. Based on the measurements and the basic equations of the actuator, a computational model written in MA TLAB has been developed by which the parameters can be extracted. The experiment is simple to do with standard vibration-laboratory equipment and is very effective in characterising the actuator. The tests have been performed on four nominally-identical actuators and different parameters are obtained in each case. Obtaining accurate values for these parameters is an essential step towards having a reliable model for the complete closed-loop system. A set of novel modal correlation measures for generally-damped systems has been developed. In each case, a dimensionless (n x n) modal-matching array is produced whose entries indicate which pairs of modes from the first system best correlate with any particular pair of modes from the second system. This modal-matching array exhibits 2 nd -order behaviour with respect to any scalar measure of that discrepancy. The work was motivated originally by the application of developing Campbell diagrams for rotating machines as continuous curves - rather than simply plotting large set of discrete points. There are several possible motivations for the proposed procedures. The most important is probably the model updating application where a vital first step is to ensure that modes have been correctly paired. The methods have been illustrated in two examples and comparisons with the established Modal Assurance Criterion methods show the new method in a good light. Two frequency dependent operations for generally-damped systems are presented in this thesis. The first operation involves developing a new frequency dependent modal expansion while the second operation generalises a previously-proposed modal correlation approach for these systems such that particular frequencies are targeted. The two suggested methods are illustrated using numerical examples. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
