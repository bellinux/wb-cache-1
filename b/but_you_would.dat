500|$|The {{scenes with}} Sansa Stark were also noted. According to Elio Garcia from westeros.org, [...] "Sophie Turner really shines in her scenes. There {{are a lot}} of people out there who judge Sansa very harshly, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have to have a heart of stone not to sympathize with her plight in this episode." [...] Many reviewers agreed with this sentiment, commenting on the {{transition}} from a [...] "spoiled brat" [...] to a young, confused, but courageous teenager were noted by several reviewers positively. Times reviewer James Poniewozik emphasized the growth of Robb Stark's character, praising both Martin's writing and Richard Madden's acting. Maureen Ryan highlighted the scene where Syrio Forel confronts the Lannister men to allow Arya's escape, which she considered masterfully staged.|$|E
2500|$|Dennett makes a {{distinction}} between the presence of representation, and the representation of presence. The example he gives regarding this distinction is this: if you were to walk into a room covered in identical portraits of Marilyn Monroe, you would see that there are many of them, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not really be seeing them all at once. There would be no detailed representation of each individual portrait just the knowledge that they are present. Dennet's theory raises two relevant questions: 1) How does the visual system detect change in the environment? 2) How much information is retained in each saccade? The proposed answer to these questions lies in several mechanisms that support a high sensitivity to change in each visual fixation. These mechanisms are: retinal adaptation, [...] "pop-out" [...] systems, and motion detectors. The implication of this view is that little information is needed to be retained between each saccade.|$|E
2500|$|A {{review of}} the book by The Economist was {{critical}} of the advice imparted in the work, [...] "This latest tome from The Donald offers shocking revelations (Lee Iacocca, a legendary tough guy and former boss of Chrysler, is a cry-baby), invaluable advice on when to get even (always) and reasons to get a prenuptial agreement ('Look at Paul McCartney, the poor bastard')." [...] A second review in The Economist wrote, [...] "Donald Trump is a Wharton alumni, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not guess it from his new bestseller, 'Think Big and Kick Ass in Business and Life', with its street-fighter's advice to always get even and never marry without a prenuptial agreement." [...] University of Hawaii business history professor Robert R. Locke wrote in Real-World Economics Review in an article on Trumponomics, [...] "The management principles Trump evokes in Think Big and Kick Ass are those for self-enrichment reminiscent of robber barons during the Gilded Age." [...] Carlos Lozada wrote for The Washington Post, [...] "I'm no billionaire, {{but much of the}} advice usually falls between obvious and useless. Stay focused, he says. Hire a great assistant. Think big." ...|$|E

[...] According to Joe D'Angelo of MTV News, Lee's [...] "...teetering on a ledge" [...] in the video shows a [...] "...distressed and emotionally wrought heroine." [...] Corey Moss of MTV wrote: [...] "...certainly as intense as a superhero movie, the sequence also gives a nice visual to the song's most memorable lyric, 'Save me.'" [...] MTV's Gil Kaufman wrote that [...] "...singer Amy Lee dreams that she has super Spidey powers, climbs up the outside of a building, spies on her creepy neighbors, then plunges into the abyss" [...] and added, [...] "...even if your boyfriend is a buff rap-rocker guy, he {{might not be able to}} save you from falling off a 20-story building to your death.
