25|$|This {{was part}} of a broader fear of spirits that might flit into dwellings. Witch bottles were common {{throughout}} Europe – bottles or glass spheres containing a mass of threads, often with charms entangled in them. Its purpose was to draw in and trap evil and negative energy directed at its owner. Folk magic contends that the witch <b>bottle</b> <b>protects</b> against evil spirits and magical attack, and counteracts spells cast by witches, also forestalling the passage into habitations of witches flying about at night. A witch ball was much the same; however, a more light-hearted belief was that the witch saw her distorted face in the curved glass and was frightened away. The term witch ball is probably a corruption of watch ball because it was used as a guard against evil spirits.|$|R

40|$|Besides {{the basic}} {{nutritional}} compounds the human diet contains {{a series of}} natural essences, that without having specific nutritional characteristics show biological activity, and can therefore be referred as phytochemical compounds. The red wine is a discrete source of phytochemical compounds positively interacting with the human organism. Among them, quercetin together with t r a n s-resveratrol are the most represented. In particular wine represents {{the main source of}} resveratrol, being fruits and vegetables the most relevant source of quercetin. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine phytoestrogens quercetin and trans-resveratrol in samples of Tuscany red wine. In order to do this, 13 wine samples from 7 producers of the area of Morellino di Scansano (Grosseto, Italy) and 13 wine samples obtained from the Chianti area (Siena, Italy) were analysed and c o m p a r e d. All the analysed samples were directly picked up from the <b>bottle,</b> <b>protected</b> from the sunlight and injected in HPLC system with diode array scan system, without any purification, extraction or filtration procedure of the wine samples. The data we obtained showed that quercetin is highly present in all the samples, with a mean value almost always above 10 mg/L and with a peak of about 20 mg/L. Similarly, the results obtained in the trans-resveratrol assays showed that the values found in samples of the Morellino and Chianti wines were, on the average, slightly higher than those reported in the international literature. In conclusion, from our analyses we observed that the phytoestrogens (quercetin and resveratrol) in the studied Tuscany red wines are well represented and correlate with grapevine variety and the soi...|$|R

50|$|From infancy, {{the only}} oral motor pattern {{appreciated}} is suck-swallow-breathe. This reflexive way of eating allows infants to feed from birth (from a breast or <b>bottle)</b> while <b>protecting</b> their airway and meeting their nutritional needs (Case-Smith & Humphry, in Case-Smith, 2005). The oral motor patterns required for eating and swallowing solids include tongue lateralization, tongue elevation, and munching/chewing, {{and unlike the}} suck-swallow-breathe sequence, coordination of these oral motor patterns is learned, not reflexive (Morris & Dunn Klein, 2000). When an infant is offered a spoon of puree, the practiced or familiar oral motor pattern is sucking. As purees are thicker than formula or breastmilk, puree is sucked off of a presented spoon and moved in the mouth {{in a similar fashion}} as liquid. This is generally looked at {{as a part of the}} process of introducing solid foods and parents are often encouraged to push past this. Conversely, current research supports that early negative experiences with eating leads to poor food acceptance in later years (Courtland, Harris, & Emmett,2009). Through playful exploration, BLW provides an opportunity for infants to practice new oral motor patterns. Through this method, infants gradually develop the oral motor patterns required for mature bolus manipulation, chewing, and swallowing, as well as allow the infant to be in charge of what goes in their mouth, how it goes in, and when. (Case-Smith, 2005, Rapley & Murkett, 2008).|$|R
30|$|The {{second phase}} {{occurred}} in the closing decades {{of the nineteenth century}} and into the twentieth century. In this phase, the primary factors that contributed to the secular reduction in mortality were revolutionary improvements in sanitation and developments in public health policy (e.g., filtering and chlorinating water supplies, building sanitation systems, draining swamps, and pasteurizing milk). Public health did not fully come into its own until the acceptance of the germ theory of disease in the 1880 s and 1890 s, which led to a wave of new public health initiatives and the conveyance of safe health practices such as boiling <b>bottles</b> of milk, <b>protecting</b> food from insects, washing hands, and ventilating rooms, among others. The dramatic subsequent reduction in water- and food-borne diseases (typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and nonrespiratory tuberculosis) highlighted the role of public health (Cutler et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{purpose of}} the present study was to assess the effect of the {{presence}} of surfactants over time on free available chlorine (FAC), pH, viscosity, and surface tension of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) preparations. Methods Three preparations containing surfactant (Chlor-XTRA 6 % [Vista Dental Products, Racine, WI], Hypocelle 4 % Forte [Dentalife, Ringwood, Australia], and White King Lemon [Pental, Shepparton, Australia]) and 2 without, Vista 6 % (Vista Dental Products) and Hypocelle 4 % Forte plain (Dentalife), were tested. The solutions were stored in closed plastic <b>bottles</b> and <b>protected</b> from light at a constant 20 °C for 213 days. FAC was measured using iodometric titration, whereas pH, surface tension, and viscosity were measured using a pH meter, pendant drop method, and rheometer, respectively. The influence of the type of solution and the presence of surfactant over time on FAC was compared with the aid of linear regression models. Two-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate the effect of passage of time and the type of solution on surface tension and the effect of the presence or absence of surfactant on the solutions. The Bonferroni test was used for multiple comparisons (post hoc) and to evaluate the effect of the presence of surfactant between solutions from the same manufacturer (α = 0. 05). Results Degradation of available chlorine was faster in the presence of surfactant when comparing solutions from the same manufacturer [Chlor-XTRA versus Vista (...|$|R

40|$|An amino-epoxy-silane based {{coating system}} (GAMAL) for glass {{surfaces}} was developed, which can efficiently <b>protect</b> <b>bottles</b> from the damages of a bottling plant. Testing bottles with a ramp pressure tester show an identical value of about (40 ± 4) bar for conventionally hot- and cold-end coated bottles and bottles coated with the developed organic-inorganic composite (GAMAL) system. After already 2 min of wet line-simulation testing, all species of a conventionally coated probe {{fall short of}} the critical limit of 16 bar, whereas bottles coated with GAMAL (thickness about 7 µm) show a value of (21 ± 3) bar. Coating is possible by dip and spray application on cold or hot (80 °C) substrates, the coating is cured at 120 °C for 5 to 10 min. Additional functions such as colour or UV protection can be added easily, without reduction of the protection potential. The low content of carbon (about 0. 5 g per 11 soft drink bottle) should not disturb the recycling process of such coated bottles...|$|R
50|$|One such {{element is}} the donor who gives the hero magical assistance, often after testing him. In The Golden Bird, the talking fox tests the hero by warning him against {{entering}} an inn and, after he succeeds, helps him find {{the object of}} his quest; in The Boy Who Drew Cats, the priest advised the hero to stay in small places at night, which protects him from an evil spirit; in Cinderella, the fairy godmother gives Cinderella the dresses she needs to attend the ball, as their mothers' spirits do in Bawang Putih Bawang Merah and The Wonderful Birch; in The Fox Sister, a Buddhist monk gives the brothers magical <b>bottles</b> to <b>protect</b> against the fox spirit. The roles can be more complicated. In The Red Ettin, the role is split into the motherwho offers the hero the whole of a journey cake with her curse or half with her blessingand when he takes the half, a fairy who gives him advice; in Mr Simigdáli, the sun, the moon, and the stars all give the heroine a magical gift. Characters who are not always the donor can act like the donor. In Kallo and the Goblins, the villain goblins also give the heroine gifts, because they are tricked; in Schippeitaro, the evil cats betray their secret to the hero, giving him the means to defeat them. Other fairy tales, such as The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was, do not feature the donor.|$|R

40|$|Thirty-four {{species of}} pocket gophers, {{represented}} by five genera, occupy the western hemisphere. In the United States there are 13 species and three genera. The major features differentiating these genera are {{the size of}} their forefeet, claws, and front surfaces of their chisel-like incisors. Thomomys have smooth-faced incisors and small forefeet with small claws. Northern pocket gophers (Thomomys talpoides) are typically from 6 1 / 2 to 10 inches (17 to 25 cm) long. Their fur is variable in color but is often yellowish brown with pale underparts. Botta’s (or valley) pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae) are extremely variable in size and color. Botta’s pocket gophers are 5 inches to about 13 1 / 2 inches (13 to 34 cm) long. Their color varies from almost white to black. Geomys have two grooves on each upper incisor and large forefeet and claws. Plains pocket gophers (Geomys bursarius) vary in length from almost 7 1 / 2 to 14 inches (18 to 36 cm). Their fur is typically brown but may vary to black. Desert pocket gophers (Geomys arenarius) are always brown and vary from nearly 8 3 / 4 to 11 inches (22 to 28 cm) long. Texas pocket gophers (Geomys personatus) are also brown and are from slightly larger than 8 3 / 4 to nearly 13 inches (22 to 34 cm) long. Southeastern pocket gophers (Geomys pinetis) are of various shades of brown, depending on soil color, and are from 9 to 13 1 / 4 inches (23 to 34 cm) long. Pappogeomys have a single groove on each upper incisor and, like Geomys, have large forefeet with large claws. Yellow-faced pocket gophers (Pappogeomys castanops) vary in length from slightly more than 5 1 / 2 to just less than 7 1 / 2 inches (14 to 19 cm). Their fur color varies from pale yellow to dark reddish brown. The underparts vary from whitish to bright yellowish buff. Some hairs on the back and top of the head are dark-tipped. Range: Pocket gophers are found only in the Western Hemisphere. They range from Panama in the south to Alberta in the north. With the exception of the southeastern pocket gopher, they occur throughout the western two-thirds of the United States. Exclusion: Generally not practical. Small mesh wire fence may provide protection for ornamental trees and shrubs or flower beds. Plastic netting protects seedlings. Cultural Methods: Damage resistant varieties of alfalfa. Crop rotation. Grain buffer strips. Control of tap-rooted forbs. Flood irrigation. Plant naturally resistant varieties of seedlings. Repellents: Synthetic predator odors are all of questionable benefit. Toxicants: Baits: Strychnine alkaloid. Zinc phosphide. Chlorophacinone. Diphacinone. Fumigants: Carbon monoxide from engine exhaust. Others are not considered very effective, but some are used: Aluminum phosphide. Gas cartridges. Trapping: Various specialized gopher kill traps. Common spring or pan trap (sizes No. 0 and No. 1). Shooting: Not practical. Other: Buried irrigation pipe or electrical cables can be <b>protected</b> with <b>cylindrical</b> pipe having an outside diameter of at least 2. 9 inches (7. 4 cm).
