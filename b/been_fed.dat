5|$|During Princess Elizabeth's 1950 tour of Canada, she {{was promised}} a Dominion gift of trumpeter swans, the {{arrangements}} {{to be made}} by Peter Scott. Canadian officials discovered the only swans tame enough to capture were at Lonesome Lake in British Columbia as they had <b>been</b> <b>fed</b> for decades by conservationist Ralph Edwards. In 1952, with the help of Ralph and his daughter Trudy, five were captured and flown to England, the first time trumpeter swans had ever flown across the Atlantic (although in the 19th century swans had been brought by ship to European zoos). One unfortunately died, but the remaining four thrived at WWT Slimbridge for many years.|$|E
5|$|By {{the close}} of 1961, the Food for Peace program was {{operating}} in a dozen countries, and 10 million more people had <b>been</b> <b>fed</b> with American surplus than the year before. In February 1962, McGovern visited India and oversaw a greatly expanded school lunch program thanks to Food for Peace; subsequently one in five Indian schoolchildren would be fed from it, and by mid-1962, 35 million children around the world. During an audience in Rome, Pope John XXIII warmly praised McGovern's work, and the distribution program was also popular among South Dakota's wheat farmers. In addition, McGovern {{was instrumental in the}} creation of the United Nations-run World Food Programme in December 1961; it started distributing food to stricken regions of the world the following year and would go on to become the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.|$|E

5|$|On Sunday, March 3, Maria Freitta, {{the owner}} of the dog and the playmate of Barker, went with her mother to a vacant, newly built ranch house next door to her home. It was on 433 2nd Ave, owned by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Vecchia. Maria managed to open a 3 ft × 5 ft bedroom closet's door, and her missing dog bounded out of the closet and leaped happily at her. Also in the closet was Barker, dead, in a seated position, the hood of her blue coat {{partially}} covering her blonde hair. She was found in the same clothes she had on when she disappeared. Bits of fur from her hat were rubbed off. Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed in the closet as the puppy had <b>been</b> <b>fed</b> recently, and there was no animal waste in the closet despite the dog not being housebroken.|$|E
5|$|At the {{old lady}}'s house, Gary has <b>been</b> <b>fed</b> a lot. The old lady puts out fresh sheets of flyers {{given to her}} by Patrick. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to feed him again, Gary finds that the old lady most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he saw before, which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, but then he turns around to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E
5|$|The female {{may begin}} feeding by biting off the male's head (as {{they do with}} regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's {{movements}} may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior {{appeared to be an}} artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had <b>been</b> <b>fed</b> ad libitum (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating. Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs.|$|E

5|$|On {{the extreme}} {{south of the}} Grebbe Line, the Grebbeberg, the Germans were now {{deploying}} three SS battalions including support troops and three fresh infantry battalions of IR.322; two of IR.374 laid in immediate reserve. During the evening and night of 12–13 May the Dutch had assembled in this sector about a dozen battalions. These forces consisted of the reserve battalions of several army corps, divisions and brigades, and the independent Brigade B, which had been freed when the Main Defence Line in the Land van Maas en Waal had been abandoned {{as part of the}} withdrawal of III Army Corps from North Brabant. However, not all of these units would be concentrated into a single effort for a counterattack to retake the main line. Some battalions had <b>been</b> <b>fed</b> immediately into the battle at the Stop Line and others were kept in reserve, mainly behind the fall-back line near the Rhenen railroad. Furthermore, most battalions were a quarter below strength. Four were to be used, under command of Brigade B, for the flanking attack from the north. This attack was delayed for several hours; when it finally started late in the morning of 13 May, it ran right into a comparable advance by two battalions of Der Fuehrer. This brigade, unaware of Dutch intentions, had shifted its attack axis to the north to roll up the Grebbe Line from behind. A confused encounter battle followed in which the vanguard of the Dutch troops, poorly supported by their artillery, began to give way at around 12:30 to the encroaching SS troops. Soon this resulted in a general withdrawal of the brigade, which turned into a rout when, at about 13:30, the Grebbeberg area was bombed by 27 Ju 87 Stukas.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} with 141 multiparous pregnant sows {{was conducted to}} investigate whether the supply of glucogenic energy {{at the end of}} pregnancy may be insufficient for an optimal growth of the foetuses in sows that <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> a diet {{with a high level of}} non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and low level of starch. Sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> one of three diets from day 85 of pregnancy until parturition: : :Sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> a high NSP low starch diet. The daily intake of starch and sugar was 500 g. : :Sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the same diet in the same amount as the sows in treatment 1 plus an extra daily amount of 500 g starch from wheat starch (is glucogenic energy). This means that the sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> 0. 58 kg/d extra wheat starch (is 6. 73 MJ glucogenic NE) during the last month of pregnancy. : :Sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the same diet in the same amount as the sows in treatment 1 plus an extra daily amount of 200 g soya oil (is 6. 73 MJ lipogenic NE). This treatment was added because otherwise it will not be clear whether energy or glucogenic energy is thelimiting factor. : :From day 1 of day 85 of pregnancy all sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the high NSP low starch diet. During lactation all sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the same lactation diet. Effects on litter performance, on changes in body weight and backfat thickness of the sows, and on feed intakeduring lactation were studied. The supply of extra dietary starch or extra dietary fat in late-pregnant sows that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> a high NSP low starch diet did not increase litter weight at birth. This suggests that sows that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the high NSP low starch diet received sufficient glucogenic energy for foetal development. : :The number of stillborn piglets was numerically higher in sows that received extra dietary fat at the end of pregnancy. Sows that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> extra dietary starch or extra dietary fat increased more in weight and backfat thickness during late pregnancy than sows that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the high NSP low starch diet. Decreases in weight and backfat thickness during lactation were similar for the three experimental treatments. Voluntary feed intake during lactation was slightly decreased in sows that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> extra starch or extra fat in late pregnancy. :The present study shows that late-pregnant sows can <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> a high NSP low starch diet without adverse effects on litter weight at birth. A daily intake of 500 to 600 g starch and sugar in latepregnant sows seems sufficient for optimal growth of the foetuses...|$|R

40|$|CONSOL {{completed}} {{characterization of}} 64 samples from five run conditions of HTI Run ALC- 1 (227 - 94), in which raw and cleaned (oil-agglomerated at low pH) Black Thunder Mine subbituminous coal <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> and processed using only dispersed catalysts in the liquefaction reactors. Extraction of THF-soluble resid from the pressure-filter cakes was more complete when agglomerates <b>were</b> <b>fed,</b> leaving only 5 % or less THF solubles in the extracted cakes. When raw coal <b>was</b> <b>fed,</b> the extracted cakes contained 9 - 34 % THF solubles. HTI also observed improved filtration during the periods that agglomerates <b>were</b> <b>fed.</b> Improved operability, if verified by additional work, {{could be an}} economically significant benefit of coal cleaning by oil agglomeration at low pH. An apparently higher Mo addition rate (see fourth bullet) {{may have contributed to}} the benefits of using oil-agglomerated coal.
