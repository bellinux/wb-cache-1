40|$|High by-pass {{turbofan}} engines {{have fewer}} fan blades and lower rotation speeds than their predecessors. Consequently, the noise suppression {{at the low}} frequency end of the noise spectra has become an increasing concern. This {{has led to a}} renewed emphasis on improving noise suppression efficiency of passive, duct liner treatments at the lower frequencies. For a variety of reasons, passive liners are comprised of locally-reacting, resonant absorbers. One reason for this design choice is to satisfy operational and economic requirements. The simplest liner design consists of a single layer of honeycomb core sandwiched between a porous facesheet and an impervious backing plate. These resonant absorbing structures are integrated into the nacelle wall and are very ef- ficient over a limited bandwidth centered on their resonance frequency. Increased noise suppression bandwidth and greater suppression at lower frequencies is typically achieved for conventional liners by increasing the liner depth and incorporating thin porous septa into the honeycomb core. However, constraints on liner depth in modern high <b>by-pass</b> <b>engine</b> nacelles severely limit the suppression bandwidth extension to lower frequencies. Also, current honeycomb core liners may not be suitable for irregular geometric volumes heretofore not considered. It is of interest, therefore, to find ways to circumvent liner depth restrictions and resonator cavity shape constraints. One way to increase effective liner depth is to skew the honeycomb core axis relative to the porous facesheet surface. Other possibilities are to alter resonator cavity shape, e. g. high aspect ratio, narrow channels that possibly include right angle bends, 180. channel fold-backs, and splayed channel walls to conform to irregular geometric constraints. These possibilities constitute the practical motivation for expanding impedance modeling capability to include unconventional resonator orientations and shapes. The work reported in this paper is in the nature of a progress report and is limited to examining the implications of resonator axis skew on the composite normal incidence impedance of an array of resonator channels. Specifically, experimental results are compared with a modified impedance prediction model for highaspect- ratio, rectangular, resonator channels with varying amounts of skew relative to the incident particle velocity. It is shown that for resonator channel widths of 1 to 2 mm, aspect ratios of 25 to 50, and skew angles of zero to sixty degrees, the surface impedance of test models can be predicted with good accuracy. Predicted resistances and reactances are particularly well correlated through the first resonance and first anti-resonance for all six test models investigated. Beyond the first anti-resonance, the impedance prediction model loses the ability to predict details of resistance and reactance but still predicts the mean trends very well...|$|E

Attention was then focused on methodology for the partitioned analysis of {{the interaction of the}} gas flow with a flexible structure and with the fluid mesh motion driven by these structural displacements.

This work shows a computation procedure to assess how this noise suppression devices impact on both fluid dynamics and acoustics of single isothermal jets.

The air transportation for the new millennium will require revolutionary solutions to meeting public demand for improving safety, reliability, environmental compatibility, and affordability. The objective of this research is to assess the trade-off between operating costs and environmental requirements of the future aero engines for short range commercial aircrafts. This involves optimising the engines' design point to minimise the block fuel and evaluating the economic and environmental impact.

40|$|The {{performance}} diagnostics of any {{engine model}} {{is accomplished by}} estimating a set of internal engine health parameters from available sensor measurements. These sensors which comprises {{of a variety of}} gas path measurements e. g. pressures, temperatures, fuel flow and spool speeds provide information regarding the health of the engine. No physical measurement, however, elaborate or precise, or how often repeated, can ever completely eliminate the universal presence of measurement uncertainties. Instrument measurements are often distorted by noise and bias, thereby masking the true condition of the engine leads to incorrect estimation results. Measurement uncertainties encourage the inaccurate fault diagnosis, and in order to improve the reliability of diagnostic results, it is important to statistically analyse the data scattering caused by sensor noise. Leakage analysis is a key factor in determining energy losses from a gas turbine. Once the components assembly fails, air leakage through the opening increases resulting in a performance loss. Therefore, the performance efficiency of the engine cannot be reliably determined, without good estimates and analysis of leakage faults. Specifically, for energy calculations it is the air flow leaking around the components at operating conditions that is required. Consequently the implementation of a leakage fault within a gas turbine engine model is necessary for any diagnostic technique that can expand its diagnostics capabilities for more accurate predictions. The simulating methods should either, precisely measure the size of leaks or measure the air flow along gas path with sufficient accuracy. In this research, the diagnostic tool that used to deals with the statistical analysis of measurement noise and leakage fault diagnostics is a model-based method utilizing non-linear GPA. For the purpose of diagnostic, the simulation code used in this study is TURBOMATCH and the engine model Trent 500.

40|$|The {{future of}} the civil {{aeronautics}} industry {{will be determined by}} the decreasing oil supplies around the world and by more environmentally friendly aircraft designs. Future Gas Turbine engines are being designed focusing on the fuel economy reducing emissions and noise. This project is on the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques to the computation and parametric analysis of drag produced by the nacelle of Very High <b>By-pass</b> Ratio (VHBR) <b>engines</b> as integrated into the airframe. Engines based on VHBR concept are consistent with the objectives of VITAL which is an EU project for creating environmentally friendly engine without SFC penalties or impairing other benefits. Three main architectures for the fan were considered for the task, a geared turbofan, contra rotating turbofan and direct drive turbofan. The long range geared turbofan is the one considered in this project. Increasing the BPR for turbofan engines {{is one of the best}} options for decreasing the SFC and noise produced by the power plant, unfortunately there are some issues to be considered. One of the major drawbacks when the BPR reaches very high values (VHBR) is the integration to the airframe because of the very large size of the fan. The drag produced by the nacelle has to be countered with propulsive force and therefore decreasing the propulsive efficiency and increasing the SFC. CFD can be used for parametric analysis of drag produced by turbofan nacelles. The analysis was carried out in 3 basic stages. 2 D geometry analyses of the afterbody and forebody are the first stage. Small changes to the basic geometry parameters were made in order to form conclusions about which parameters are more significant for drag generation in each section of the nacelle. In the second stage of the project a 3 D geometric analysis was carried out with the whole nacelle. The important parameters from the 2 D simulations and some of the parameters required for 3 D geometry were varied in the analysis. Conclusions were made about the influence of each of the parameters in drag generation and their influence on the interaction between forebody and afterbody. In the third stage of the project, the influence on drag of the positioning of the engine relative to the wing is analyzed. No geometry changes were made and no pylon was used. Conclusions were made from the changes of pressure distribution and supersonic zones and their impact on the drag. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Typical modem fighter aircraft use two-spool, low <b>by-pass</b> ratio, turbojet <b>engines</b> to provide the thrust needed {{to carry out the}} combat manoeuvres required by present-day air warfare tactics. The dynamic characteristics of such aircraft engines are complex and non-linear. The need for fast, accurate control of the engine throughout the flight envelope is of paramount importance and this research was concerned with the study of such problems and subsequent design of an optimal linear control which would improve the engine's dynamic response and provide the required correspondence between the output from the engine and the values commanded by a pilot. A detailed mathematical model was derived which, in accuracy and complexity of representation, was a large improvement upon existing analytical models, which assume linear operation over a very small region of the state space, and which was simpler than the large non-analytic representations, which are based on matching operational data. The non-linear model used in this work was based upon information obtained from DYNGEN, a computer program which is used to calculate the steady-state and transient responses of turbojet and turbofan engines. It is a model of fifth order which, it is shown, correctly models the qualitative behaviour of a representative jet engine. A number of operating points were selected to define the boundaries used for the flight envelope. For each point a performance investigation was carried out and a related linear model was established. By posing the problem of engine control as a linear quadratic problem, in which the constraint was the state equation of the linear model, control laws appropriate for each operating point were obtained. A single control was effective with the linear model at every point. The same control laws were then applied to the non-linear mathematical model adjusted for each operating point, and the resulting responses were carefully studied to determine if one single control law could be used with all operating points. Such a law was established. This led, naturally, to the determination of an optimal linear tracking control law, and a further investigation to determine whether there existed an optimal non-linear control law for the non-linear model. In the work presented in this dissertation these points are fully discussed and the reasons for choosing to find an optimal linear control law for the non-linear model by solving the related two-point, boundary value problem using the method of quasilinearisation are presented. A comparison of the effectiveness of the respective optimal control laws, based upon digital simulation, is made before suggestions and recommendations for further work are presented...|$|R
