5|$|In North America {{and most}} of Europe, voles predominate in the diet and shrews are {{the second most common}} food choice. Mice and rats form the main {{foodstuffs}} in the Mediterranean region, the tropics, sub-tropics and Australia. Barn owls are usually more specialist feeders in productive areas and generalists in drier areas. On the Cape Verde Islands, geckos are the mainstay of the diet, supplemented by birds such as plovers, godwits, turnstones, weavers and pratincoles, and on a rocky islet off the coast of California, a clutch of four young were being reared on a diet of Leach's storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa). In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the <b>bank</b> <b>vole</b> in the 1950s led to a major shift in the barn owl's diet: where their ranges overlap, the vole is now by far the largest prey item. Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual usually make up the single largest proportion of prey. In the United States, rodents and other small mammals usually make up ninety-five percent of the diet and worldwide, over ninety percent of the prey caught.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to test whether <b>bank</b> <b>voles</b> develop type 1 diabetes in association with Ljungan virus. Two groups of <b>bank</b> <b>voles</b> were analyzed for diabetes, pancreas histology, autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD 65), IA- 2, and insulin by standardized radioligand-binding assays as well as antibodies to in vitro transcribed and translated Ljungan virus antigens.

Group B represented 67 <b>bank</b> <b>voles,</b> which were trapped and kept in the laboratory for 1 month before being euthanized. Group A <b>bank</b> <b>voles</b> did not have diabetes. <b>Bank</b> <b>voles</b> in group B (22 / 67; 33 %) developed diabetes due to specific lysis of pancreatic islet beta cells. Compared to nondiabetic group B <b>bank</b> <b>voles,</b> diabetic animals had increased levels of GAD 65 (P <. 0001), IA- 2 (P <. 0001), and insulin (P =. 03) autoantibodies. Affected islets stained positive for Ljungan virus, a novel picorna virus isolated from <b>bank</b> <b>voles.</b> Ljungan virus inoculation of nondiabetic wild <b>bank</b> <b>voles</b> induced beta-cell lysis.

40|$|Olfaction mediates {{many aspects}} of the <b>bank</b> <b>vole’s</b> life. However, all the {{mechanisms}} are far from being fully understood. In the present context of habitat fragmentation, to study how olfactory cues can mediate its social processes, influence its active search for biotic resources and elicit its movements appears to be of major interest and is the main objective of this PhD-thesis. The research started with three behavioural experiments, performed under laboratory conditions. <b>Bank</b> <b>voles</b> were found to behave differently to scent marks according to the population of origin of the marker. They react more to odours from OPO conspecifics (i. e. members of an Other Population of Origin) than to odours from conspecifics belonging to their own population. A field enclosure experiment was then set up in order to study the ability of <b>bank</b> <b>voles</b> to distinguish between different artificial odours (i. e. extracted with methanol) sprayed on food. The results confirmed the attractiveness of OPO conspecific odours even extracted with methanol and tested in outdoor conditions. On the other hand, odours from terrestrial predators (i. e. weasel and red fox) were found to be strongly repulsive. The most attractive artificial olfactory marker (i. e. from OPO conspecific) and the most repulsive one (i. e. from weasel) were then tested on the spatial behaviour of voles. Both were used in a complex maze with attractive markers placed in pathways leading to the goal and repulsive markers placed in pathways to be avoided. Results obtained were inconclusive, none of the artificial marker showed an influence on movements of <b>bank</b> <b>voles.</b> As voles did not take heed of artificial markers while moving, we hypothesised that natural scented trails created by conspecifics, should direct the <b>bank</b> <b>voles</b> to the goal more efficiently than artificial markers did. However, the overall movements of <b>bank</b> <b>voles</b> were not significantly influenced by the presence of natural odours of conspecifics either. Original and convincing results were found on the use of olfaction in social and foraging contexts in <b>bank</b> <b>voles.</b> However, this four-year research did not come up with findings on whether and how olfactory cues can influence their spatial behaviour. The idea is worthwhile pursuing as proposed in the perspectives, and there is hope that in the future we may understand which elements elicit movements of <b>bank</b> <b>voles</b> for helping to counteract the impacts of habitat fragmentation on populations.

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} {{concluded}} that the development of polydipsia (PD, a daily water intake $ 21 ml) among captive Danish <b>bank</b> <b>voles,</b> is associated with the development of a type 1 diabetes (T 1 D), based on findings of hyperglycaemia, glucosuria, ketonuria/-emia, lipemia, destroyed beta cells, and presence of autoantibodies against GAD 65, IA- 2, and insulin. Aim and Methods: We retrospectively analysed data from two separate colonies of Danish <b>bank</b> <b>voles</b> in order to 1) estimate survivorship after onset of PD, 2) evaluate whether the weight of PD voles differed from non-PD voles, and, 3), evaluate a state of PD as a practical and non-invasive tool to screen for voles with a high probability of hypeglycaemia. In addition, we discuss regional differences related to the development of diabetes in Scandinavian <b>bank</b> <b>voles</b> and the relevance of the Ljungan virus as proposed etiological agent. Results: We found that median survival after onset of PD is at least 91 days (lower/upper quartiles = 57 / 134 days) with a maximum recording of at least 404 days survivorship. The development of PD did not influence the weight of Danish <b>bank</b> <b>voles.</b> The measures of accuracy when using PD as predictor of hyperglycaemia, i. e. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, equalled 69 %, 97 %, 89 %, and 89 %, respectively.

40|$|Cowpox virus (CPXV) is a {{zoonotic}} {{virus and}} endemic in wild rodent populations in Eurasia.

All <b>bank</b> <b>voles,</b> independently of lineage, sex and age, were resistant to clinical signs following CPXV inoculation, and no virus shedding was detected in nasal or buccal swabs. In-contact control animals became only rarely infected. However, depending on the CPXV strain used, inoculated animals seroconverted and viral DNA could be detected preferentially in the upper respiratory tract. The highest antibody titers and virus DNA loads in the lungs were detected after inoculation with two strains from Britain and Finland. We conclude from our experiments {{that the role of}} <b>bank</b> <b>voles</b> as an efficient and exclusive CPXV reservoir seems questionable, and that CPXV may be maintained in most regions by other hosts, including other vole species.
