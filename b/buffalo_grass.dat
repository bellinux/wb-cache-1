5|$|Webs are {{typically}} established in low-growing dune plants and other vegetation {{such as the}} native Pingao (Desmoschoenus spiralis) or the introduced marram grass (Ammophila arenaria). They may also build their webs under driftwood, stones, or other debris such as empty tin cans or bottles. Webs are almost always constructed over open sand and near the ground so as to catch crawling insects for food. Spiders inhabiting dune grasses construct their webs in open spaces between the grass tufts, while spiders inhabiting areas of shrubbery do so {{on the underside of}} a plant overhanging open sand. It has been found that these patches of open sand are necessary for katipo to build their webs as plants that envelop sand dunes in dense cover, such as exotic plants like kikuyu or <b>buffalo</b> <b>grass,</b> create an environment unsuitable for web construction. The katipo therefore prefers to spin its web amongst pingao plants as this plants growth pattern leaves patches of sand between each plant. The wind can then blow insects and other prey through these gaps and into the web. Marram grass has been extensively planted in New Zealand to help stabilise sand dunes and has largely replaced pingao in many areas. Because marram grass grows in a very tight formation only leaving small gaps between tuffs, this makes it difficult for the katipo to construct a suitable web for capturing prey.|$|E

25|$|Historical {{habitats}} of the {{black-footed ferret}} included shortgrass prairie, mixed-grass prairie, desert grassland, shrub steppe, sagebrush steppe, mountain grassland, and semi-arid grassland. Black-footed ferrets use prairie dog burrows for raising young, avoiding predators, and thermal cover.

Black-tailed prairie dog colonies contain a greater burrow density per acre than white-tailed prairie dog colonies, and may be more suitable for the recovery of black-footed ferrets. The type of prairie dog burrow may be important for occupancy by black-footed ferrets. Black-footed ferret litters near Meeteetse, Wyoming, were associated with mounded white-tailed prairie dog burrows, which are less common than non-mounded burrows. Mounded burrows contain multiple entrances and probably have a deep and extensive burrow system that protects kits. However, black-footed ferrets used non-mounded prairie dog burrows (64%) more often than mounded burrows (30%) near Meeteetse, Wyoming.|$|E

40|$|Kansas {{is legendary}} for {{geographical}} monotony, for a landscape allegedly so absent {{of trees and}} relief {{that the state has}} become the butt of national jokes and a cultural synonym for flat. Kansas is not really flat; tilted might be a better description, for the state rises some 3, 300 feet in elevation along the 400 -mile stretch between Kansas City and Kanorado. Kansas is lacking in substantial tree cover, though, especially in its western third. US Forest Service researchers noted in 1999 that forests covered slightly less than 3 percent of the state, concentrated mostly in the northeast and southeast corners. Such treelessness {{is due in part to}} the needs of the state 2 ̆ 7 s agricultural empire, but botanists, biologists, and ecologists tell us that environmental conditions play a more fundamental role. Basic ecology textbooks place most of the state in North America 2 ̆ 7 s temperate grassland biome, whose characteristic vegetation consists of great expanses of bluestem, <b>buffalo,</b> and grama <b>grasses,</b> and whose native trees are few and far between, confined mostly to riverbanks and isolated ridges. 1 So prevalent is the idea of a treeless Kansas that few people are aware of the many concerted attempts, during its first seventy years, to forest the state artificially. The first white settlers in Kansas were as shocked by its lack of timber as any modern Easterner driving down Interstate 70. Yet those settlers were typical nineteenth-century Americans as well, steeped in contemporary beliefs about nature, agriculture, and progress, and so they attacked the treeless expanses with the devotion of crusaders. For five decades in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as they dreamed about making a garden of the prairie, Kansans made serious attempts at forestry, trying to cover their state with the large and leafy groves that, to them, were an integral part of civilized life. They planted extensively on their farms and around their homes, formed their own state horticultural society in 1868, established two forestry experiment stations in 1887, and eventually attempted the creation of their own national forest from 1905 to 1915. All the while, information and advice about trees and tree planting circulated in agricultural bulletins, horticultural society reports, newspaper columns, and so on, as forestry became an obsession on the Kansas grasslands. 2 That their efforts were generally unsuccessful is no surprise. Although trees can be grown on the Great Plains, its ecological character makes large-scale forestry in much of Kansas impossible, and the treeless spaces across the state 2 ̆ 7 s western third bear witness to the failure. Indeed, there is a temptation to snicker at the thought of Kansas forestry, and at anyone who would entertain such a concept in a land so ill-suited to it. A mote serious consideration of this effort, however, tells us much about settlers 2 ̆ 7 views of the Great Plains environment. What motivated their grand forestry ideas and efforts in the face of such daunting environmental odds? Elliott West writes that whites came to the Great Plains with an idealized 2 ̆ 2 vision 2 ̆ 2 of a land civilized by towns, farms, and markets. Forestry efforts in Kansas reveal that the landscape itself was also an important part of this vision. For the state 2 ̆ 7 s settlers, trees and forests went hand in hand with towns, farms, and markets; a 2 ̆ 2 civilized 2 ̆ 2 natural environment was inseparable from civilization. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{conservation}} of biodiversity {{and natural resources}} relies {{to a large extent}} on the establishment of protected areas. However, protected areas often fail to meet the objectives that lead to their establishment, due to poor control over the manifold, legal and illegal human activities within protected areas, insufficient knowledge about system characteristics, in particular with respect to disturbance regimes, and due to inappropriate management strategies and means of implementation. The study investigates the responses of large herbivores to anthropogenic disturbances in Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP), Uganda. Unique features of QENP are high human population densities within and outside the park and a high degree of habitat fragmentation, resulting from natural (topography, lakes, channel) and anthropogenic (villages, roads, cattle pastures) factors. Outstanding disturbances are man-made fires that frequently devastate large parts of the park. Fire frequency and severity have increased over the last decades, leading to widespread and long-lasting loss of herbivore feeding grounds. The study {{is based on the assumption}} that the present fire regime, in combination with other anthropogenic disturbances adversely affects the population development of the abundant large grazers in QENP under the local geo-ecological conditions. The main goals of this study are (1) to establish spatial and temporal habitat utilisation patterns of buffalo (Syncerus caffer), Uganda kob (Kobus kob thomasi) and hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) in relation to the prevailing fire regime and other anthropogenic disturbances, and (2) to provide baseline data for the elaboration of a fire management plan. The study area is dominated by grassland in the central parts and bush-land with variable densities of bushes towards the water. Most of the study area is surrounded by water. Point surveys were conducted to estimate the distribution and abundance of the focal species, using Distance sampling. Environmental and anthropogenic factors were quantified by distances from each observation point using a Geographic Information System (GIS). All geo-referenced data were subject to multiple regression analyses. Regression models for several stages of vegetation development before and after burning were used to evaluate the spatial and temporal relationship between different disturbance factors and large herbivore abundance. The effects of increasingly frequent fires over the last decades in the study area are the spread of fire climax plant species such as Acacia sieberiana and shrubs of Acacia hockii, the spread of Imperata cylindrica, a widely indigestible grass species, and species-poor overgrazed grasslands in the main distribution area of Uganda kob. The distribution of Uganda kob is generally restricted to open grasslands and near to water in the North and East of the study area. Their movements in postfire-periods largely depend on the locality of burnt areas. Fresh pasture after burns is highly attractive to Uganda kob in all stages of postfire-development. However, adult males can suffer from food shortage after burns due to their strong attachment to their mating grounds (leks). Uganda kob does not show significant avoidance with regard to human activities, villages and roads. They are mostly affected by the decrease of suitable pasture in parts of the study area due to the encroachment of Imperata cylindrica. The data collected show that density of Uganda kob has significantly reduced in the western part of the study area where they were widely distributed two decades ago. In addition, the combination of frequent fires and heavy grazing after burns led to a loss of high quality grass species in their main distribution areas. The distribution patterns of buffalo are characterised by an accumulation of large herds in the central grasslands of the study area, while smaller herds occupy bush-land closer to the water. In postfireperiods <b>buffaloes</b> prefer tall <b>grass</b> savanna in the southern part of the study area. They utilise postfire pasture in burnt areas only in advanced stages of vegetation development. Buffaloes are affected by all quantified anthropogenic disturbances. They clearly avoid the vicinity of villages. The main road through the park restricts the movements of buffalo herds. Adverse effects of the habitat fragmentation become evident when home ranges of buffalo herds are burnt to a large extent. One of the outstanding threats to buffalo is, however, competition with life-stock. Over the last decades buffaloes have nearly disappeared in areas with live-stock occupancy. Furthermore, inter-specific competition is probable between buffalo and hippopotamus in their feeding grounds along the water in postfire-periods. Hippopotamuses are still abundant in large numbers in the study area. At present, they seem not to be affected by anthropogenic disturbances, apart from poaching. The equilibrium of population sizes of the mega-herbivores hippopotamus and elephant (Loxodonta africana) is important for maintaining the savanna structure in the study area, and in consequence for the viability of other herbivores. Since elephants are not abundant in high numbers, the spread of bushes is one of the aspects to be monitored with respect to habitat availability (open grasslands) for other large herbivores. Appropriate fire management strategies could regulate the grassland-bushland mosaic in the study area. Fire management is a tool to avoid adverse and amplify advantageous effects of fire on the habitats of herbivores. Recommendations for fire management in terms of controlled burning and protection from fires are given on the base of habitat classification that specifies temporal, spatial and functional aspects of the habitat use of large herbivores in time and space. The dynamic interrelations of anthropogenic and natural factors described may additionally contribute to adaptive strategies for the protection of wildlife in QENP...|$|R
