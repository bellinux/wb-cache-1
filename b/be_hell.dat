500|$|On January 5, 1996, a new {{development}} thrust the travel office matter again to the forefront. A two-year-old memo from White House director of administration David Watkins surfaced that identified First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton as the motivating force behind the firings, with the additional involvement of Vince Foster and Harry Thomason. [...] "Foster regularly informed me that the First Lady was concerned and desired action. The action desired was the firing of the Travel Office staff." [...] Written in fall 1993, apparently intended for McLarty, the Watkins memo also said [...] "we both know that there would <b>be</b> <b>hell</b> to pay" [...] if [...] "we failed to take swift and decisive action in conformity with the First Lady's wishes." [...] This memo contradicted the First Lady's previous statements in the GAO investigation, that she had played {{no role in the}} firings and had not consulted with Thomason beforehand; the White House also found it difficult to explain why the memo was so late in surfacing when all the previous investigations had requested all relevant materials. [...] House committee chair Clinger charged a cover-up was taking place and vowed to pursue new material.|$|E
500|$|Within {{weeks the}} Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George C. Marshall, {{implemented}} sweeping {{changes to the}} War Department designed {{to reduce the number}} of people reporting to him so as to free his time for planning and conducting a global war. Three huge new commands were created by Executive Order Number 9082 of 28 February 1942, [...] "Reorganizing the Army and the War Department": the Army Air Forces under Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold, the Army Ground Forces under Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair and the Services of Supply, under Somervell. As such, he was not only promoted to the rank of lieutenant general over the heads of many more senior officers, but some of them, including Reybold, now found themselves his subordinates. He was answerable to two men: Marshall, and Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson. Somervell built up a good working relationship with both. Senator Harry S. Truman of the Truman Committee disapproved of Somervell's cost overruns, declaring: [...] "I will say this for General Somervell, he will get the stuff, but it is going to <b>be</b> <b>hell</b> on the taxpayer. He has a WPA attitude on the expenditure of money." [...] The Services of Supply were renamed the Army Service Forces in March 1943, as the term [...] "supply" [...] was felt to be too narrow a description of the broad range of logistic activities carried out by the organization. As head of Army Service Forces, Somervell became responsible for the implementation of the Army Supply Program.|$|E

Keats then convinces everyone else except Alex to accept a [...] "transfer" [...] to his own department - implied to <b>be</b> <b>Hell</b> with Keats being the Devil - but with Alex's help Hunt persuades them to return.|$|E
