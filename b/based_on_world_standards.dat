Karazin Kharkiv National University in Software Engineering training, especially in organizing students ’ practical work so that they gain competences required by modern software industry <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>world</b> <b>standards.</b> As software development became now comprehensive industry there is strong demand for highly qualified specialists all over the world. As any industry it is based on standards for products as well as for processes. So any university graduate planning to work in this industry should know these standards and be able to work with them including tailoring to the concrete situation. It is especially true for the graduates majoring in Computer Science (CS). Usually these knowledge and skills are taught in the course of Software Engineering (SE) which is adjourned to the senior years when all the fundamental concepts of CS and technological skills have been already gained. Unfortunately all manuals on SE studies including Computing Curricula present only core topics to discuss and learn but no hints on how to organize practice with visible results of students...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of esophageal adenocarcinoma was increasing in the Western Europe and United States, {{but not in}} East Asian countries. Population <b>based</b> study <b>on</b> the trend of esophageal adenocarcinoma in Hong Kong was not available. Materials and Methods: Population-based data of Hong Kong Cancer Registry from 1984 to 2003 were used. Cases were grouped into four 5 -year periods. Average age standardized rate (WSR) of each period was calculated by averaging the WSR of the 5 years in each period, <b>basing</b> <b>on</b> the <b>world</b> <b>standard</b> population, with adjustment made for cases with missing histology. Results: 10, 751 newcases of esophageal neoplasm were studied (8, 637 males and 2, 114 females). Esophageal adenocarcinoma declined among both males and females, with the total number decreased from 224 in 1984 to 1988 to 131 in 1998 to 2003. WSR decreased from 1. 10 of 100, 000 in 1984 to 1988 to 0. 34 of 100, 000 in 1998 to 2003. The decline was faster than that for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma so that the relative ratio of esophageal adenocarcinoma decreased from 11. 7 % in 1984 to 1988 to 6. 4 % in 1998 to 2003. Conclusions: The {{incidence of}} esophageal adenocarcinoma and ratio of esophageal adenocarcinoma versus esophageal squamous cell carcinoma decreased in Hong Kong.

40|$|Objective: Given {{the trends}} in aging worldwide, in Mexico, we {{determined}} trends in adjusted mortality rates due to cancer and 11 cancer subtypes in older individuals (> 65 years) from 2000 to 2010. Methods: For this retrospective study, we collected data on mortality due to cancer from the registries of the National Institute of Statistics and Geography. Adjusted rates were calculated with a direct method <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the <b>world</b> <b>standard</b> population. Trend {{analysis was performed}} with a linear regression of the natural logarithm of the adjusted rate, and trends were evaluated with the Student´s t test. Results: During the studied period, the cancer mortality rates significantly declined from 630. 21 to 573. 03 (per 100, 000 inhabitants) in the overall population. Similar declines were observed in women (from 548. 81 to 490. 09) and men (from 726. 03 to 672. 94). Significant declines in mortality rates were observed across several cancer subtypes, including esophageal, gastric, colorectal-anal, liver-biliary, pancreatic, and tracheal-bronchial-lung cancers. Significant increases in mortality rates were observed in colorectal and breast cancer, but no changes were observed in mortality rates due to prostate, ovarian, bladder, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma cancers. Conclusion: Mortality due to cancer in older Mexicans was lower than that observed in developed countries, and it significantly declined over the study period. Men had higher mortality rates than women. The highest mortality rates were due to breast and prostate cancer subtypes in older individuals...|$|R

Cardiac myxoma (CM) {{is the most common}} primary benign tumor of the heart, but the true age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) has remained unknown. We therefore used nationwide registries in Iceland to study CM and establish its incidence rate. This was a retrospective study involving all patients diagnosed with CM in Iceland between 1986 and 2010. Cases were identified through three different registries, and hospital charts and histology results reviewed. An ASR was estimated <b>based</b> <b>on</b> a <b>world</b> <b>standard</b> population (w). Nine cases of CM (six women) were identified {{with a mean age of}} 62. 8 years (range: 37 - 85), giving an ASR of 0. 11 (95 % CI: 0. 05 - 0. 22) per 100, 000. The mean tumor size was 4. 4 cm (range: 1. 5 - 8. 0) with all the tumors located in the left atrium. Dyspnea (n = 6) and ischemic stroke (n = 2) were the most common symptoms. All patients underwent complete resection of the tumor and there were no postoperative deaths or CM-related deaths at follow-up (mean 85 months). The ASR of CM in Iceland was 0. 11 per 100, 000. To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine the incidence of CM in an entire population. In Iceland, the presenting symptoms and mode of detection of CM are similar to those in other series...|$|R

40|$|The {{real-time}} {{estimation of}} ambient particulate matter with diameter no greater than 2. 5 μm (PM 2. 5) is currently quite limited in China. A semi-physical geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was adopted to estimate PM 2. 5 mass concentrations at national scale using the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aerosol Optical Depth product fused by the Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) algorithms, combined with meteorological parameters. The fitting results could explain over 80 % {{of the variability}} in the corresponding PM 2. 5 mass concentrations, and the estimation tends to overestimate when measurement is low and tends to underestimate when measurement is high. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>World</b> Health Organization <b>standards,</b> results indicate that most regions in China suffered severe PM 2. 5 pollution during winter. Seasonal average mass concentrations of PM 2. 5 predicted by the model indicate that residential regions, namely Jing-Jin-Ji Region and Central China, were faced with challenge from fine particles. Moreover, estimation deviation caused primarily by the spatially uneven distribution of monitoring sites and the changes of elevation in a relatively small region has been discussed. In summary, real-time PM 2. 5 was estimated effectively by the satellite-based semi-physical GWR model, and the results could provide reasonable references for assessing health impacts and offer guidance on air quality management in China...|$|R

30|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of economic activities in coastal parts of Nigeria has triggered an uncoordinated development of groundwater leading to stress on the resource. Hence a {{study was conducted to}} assess the hydrogeological characteristics of the shallow coastal aquifer of southern Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. Emphasis was on the hydraulic characteristics, quality with respect to domestic and irrigation purposes and influence of seawater. The study result revealed that the aquifer consist of intercalations of clayey sand and sand. The aquifer is characterized by high hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity values. The groundwater flow direction is southwards with higher groundwater depletion in the dry season. Groundwater samples from hand dug wells and boreholes were evaluated <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>World</b> Health Organization <b>standard</b> and some indices, respectively, for drinking and irrigation uses. The groundwaters are fit for drinking and domestic uses. However, more than 70  % of the pH values are not within the allowable limits of between 6.5 and 9.2 for drinking and domestic use. Therefore, it is recommended that neutralizing filter containing calcite or ground limestone should be applied to raise the pH of the groundwater. Of the 10 parameters used to assess the water for irrigation use, only sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), magnesium hazard (MH) and magnesium ratio indicated the excellent quality of these waters. Na+-K+-HCO 3 − constitute the dominant water type. Total dissolved solids and ratios of Na+/Cl−, Mg 2 +/Cl−, and Ca 2 +/SO 4 2 − and saltwater mixing index (SMI) suggest some level of seawater intrusion in the area.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} recent and long term occupational lead exposure on indicators of male reproductive health. METHODS: In a cross sectional study of male employees of a lead smelter (n = 2469), blood samples were obtained from 152 workers including 119 who also provided semen samples. Semen analysis and serum concentrations of testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone, and luteinising hormone were used as indicators of reproductive health. Semen and hormone variables were examined in relation to measures of current and long term body lead burden estimated from current blood lead concentrations and historical blood lead monitoring data. RESULTS: For current blood lead concentration groups of 40 micrograms/dl, the geometric mean sperm concentrations were, respectively, 79. 1, 56. 5, 62. 7, and 44. 4 million cells/ml and geometric mean total sperm counts were 186, 153, 137, and 89 million cells (P for trend 0. 04). Compared with workers with blood lead concentrations less than 15 micrograms/dl, workers with current blood lead concentrations of 40 micrograms/dl or more had {{an increased risk of}} below normal sperm concentration (odds ratio (OR) 8. 2, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 2 - 57. 9) and total sperm count (OR 2. 6, 95 % CI 0. 4 - 15. 7), <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>World</b> Health Organisation <b>standards.</b> Independent of current lead exposure, sperm concentration, total sperm count, and total motile sperm count were inversely related to measures of long term lead exposure. No association was found between lead exposure and measures of sperm motility, sperm morphology, or serum concentrations of reproductive hormones.

40|$|Background Concurrent {{with the}} {{dramatic}} {{cultural and economic}} shifts occurring as mainland China becomes increasingly “Westernized,” the weight perceptions, ideal body weight, and weight management goals and practices of Chinese females have also undergone significant changes. Objective To investigate relationships between overweight status, weight perception patterns, and weight management goals and practices in Chinese female college students. Design/participants/setting A cross-sectional analysis was conducted with data from 902 female subjects aged 18 to 25 years participating in the China Seven Cities Study, a health promotion and smoking prevention study conducted in mainland China in 2003. Main outcome measures/statistical analyses Logistic regression models were used to explore associations between overweight status, weight perception, specific weight management goals and practices, and current levels of vigorous-intensity physical activity and food consumption. Results <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>World</b> Health Organization <b>standards</b> for Asian adults, 16. 7 % of college females were overweight or obese, although 50. 8 % considered themselves to be “too heavy. ” Among participants perceiving themselves as overweight (n= 458), 69. 2 % (n= 371) were inaccurate and did not meet criteria for overweight or obese. The percentage of participants attempting weight loss was 48. 2 %, and 33. 1 % wanted to maintain their current weight. Attempts to lose or maintain weight were related to actual and perceived weight status, but not to increased vigorous-intensity physical activity or fruit and vegetable intake, nor to decreased consumption of sweets, soda, Western fast foods, and fried foods. Only 21. 5 % of participants desiring weight loss or maintenance reported {{using a combination of}} vigorous-intensity physical activity and a reduced-fat and -calorie diet, whereas 20. 2 % tried extreme methods such as fasting, using diet pills, vomiting, or smoking. Conclusions Our findings underscore the need to promote healthy weight management practices among Chinese female college students, with an emphasis on diet and physical activity strategies that encourage balance rather than extremes...|$|R
40|$|Type 2 (T 2 DM) is {{believed}} to be common in Saudi Arabia, but data are limited. In this population survey, we determined the prevalence of T 2 DM and prediabetes. A representative sample among residents aged ≥ 18 years of the city of Jeddah was obtained comprising both Saudi and non-Saudi families (N = 1420). Data on dietary, clinical and socio-demographic characteristics were collected and anthropometric measurements taken. Fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) were used to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes employing American Diabetes Association criteria. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with T 2 DM. Age and sex standardized prevalence of prediabetes was 9. 0 % (95 % CI 7. 5 - 10. 5); 9. 4 % (7. 1 - 11. 8) in men and 8. 6 % (6. 6 - 10. 6) in women. For DM it was 12. 1 % (10. 7 - 13. 5); 12. 9 % (10. 7 - 13. 5) in men and 11. 4 % (9. 5 - 13. 3) in women. The prevalence <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>World</b> Population as <b>standard</b> was 18. 3 % for DM and 11. 9 % for prediabetes. The prevalence of DM and prediabetes increased with age. Of people aged ≥ 50 years 46 % of men and 44 % of women had DM. Prediabetes and DM were associated with various measures of adiposity. DM was also associated with and family history of dyslipidemia in women, cardiovascular disease in men, and with hypertension, dyslipidemia and family history of diabetes in both sexes. Age was the strongest predictor of DM and prediabetes followed by obesity. Of people aged 50 years or over almost half had DM and another 10 - 15 % had prediabetes leaving only a small proportion of people in this age group with normoglycemia. Since we did not use an oral glucose tolerance test the true prevalence of DM and prediabetes is thus likely to be even higher than reported here. These results demonstrate the urgent need to develop primary prevention strategies for type 2 diabetes in Saudi Arabia...|$|R

The emergence of resistance to SP is a concern requiring monitoring the effectiveness of SP for IPTp. This was an in-vivo efficacy study to determine the parasitological treatment response and the duration of post-treatment prophylaxis among asymptomatic pregnant women receiving SP as part of IPTp in Mali and Burkina-Faso. The primary outcome was the PCR-unadjusted % of patients with parasites recurrence by day 42 defined as a positive diagnostic test by malaria smear at any visit between days 4 and 42. Treatment failure was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the <b>standard</b> <b>World</b> Health Organization criteria. The therapeutic response was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier curve. A total of 580 women were enrolled in Mali (N= 268) and Burkina-Faso (N= 312) and followed weekly for 42 days. Among these, 94. 3 % completed the follow-up. The PCR-unadjusted cumulative risk of recurrence by day 42 was 4. 9 % overall, and 3. 2 % and 6. 5 % in Mali and Burkina Faso respectively (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 2. 14, 95 %, CI [0. 93 - 4. 90]; P= 0. 070), and higher among the primi- and secundigravida (6. 4 %) than multigravida (2. 2 %, HR= 3. 01 [1. 04 - 8. 69]; P= 0. 042). The PCR-adjusted failure risk was 1. 1 % overall (Mali 0. 8 %, Burkina-Faso 1. 4 %). The frequencies (95 % CI) of the dhfr double and triple mutant and dhps 437 and 540 alleles mutant genotype at enrolment were 24. 2 % (23. 7 - 25. 0), 4. 7 % (4. 4 - 5. 0), and 21. 4 % (20. 8 - 22. 0) and 0. 37 % (0. 29 - 0. 44) in Mali, and 7. 1 % (6. 5 - 7. 7), 44. 9 % (43. 8 - 46. 0) and 75. 3 % (74. 5 - 76. 2) and 0 % in Burkina-Faso, respectively.
