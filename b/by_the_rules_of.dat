5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins is determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from {{a sequence}} of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> {{war of the}} period, {{the victor}} possessed {{absolute}} rights over the vanquished, whether they were soldiers or not. Enslavement, while not systematic, was common practice. Thucydides recalls that 7,000 inhabitants of Hyccara in Sicily were taken prisoner by Nicias and sold for 120 talents in the neighbouring village of Catania. Likewise in 348 BC the population of Olynthus was reduced to slavery, as was that of Thebes in 335 BC by Alexander the Great and that of Mantineia by the Achaean League.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of Nri was a religio-polity, {{a sort of}} theocratic state, that {{developed}} in the central heartland of the Igbo region. The Nri had a taboo symbolic code with six types. These included human (such as twins), animal, object, temporal, behavioral, speech and place taboos. The rules regarding these taboos were used to educate and govern Nri's subjects. This meant that, while certain Igbo may have lived under different formal administration, all followers of the Igbo religion had to abide <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> the faith and obey its representative on earth, the eze Nri.|$|E

5|$|Under the new charter, Philadelphians {{elected a}} seventeen-member city council in 1951, with ten members {{representing}} districts of the city, {{and the remaining}} seven being elected at-large. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each political party could nominate five candidates and voters could only vote for five, {{with the result that}} the majority party could only take five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party.

5|$|In 1955, Shepard ran for an at-large {{seat on the}} Philadelphia City Council. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> {{the limited}} voting system for the at-large seats, each {{political}} party could nominate five candidates and voters could only vote for five, with the result being that the majority party could only take {{five of the seven}} seats, leaving two for the minority party. Shepard won one of the five Democratic slots and was easily elected. On the council, he served as head of the public works committee. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Shepard initially opposed the change, but later voted in favor after party leaders promised him more black Democrats would get political appointments. The amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval but failed in a vote that April.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Jean Cadenat and Jacques Blache {{revisited}} {{the type}} specimens of S. tudes {{and found that}} the lectotype from Nice is likely not a smalleye hammerhead, but rather a fetal whitefin hammerhead (S. couardi, likely a synonym of the scalloped hammerhead, S. lewini). This would also explain the anomalous locality of the Nice specimen, as the smalleye hammerhead is not otherwise known outside of the Americas. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> binomial nomenclature, Sphyra tudes should then become the valid name for the whitefin hammerhead, taking precedence over S. couardi, and the smalleye hammerhead would revert to being Sphyrna bigelowi. Taxonomists, though, have been reluctant to change the names again, preferring to keep the smalleye hammerhead as S. tudes. For this solution to have official status would require a decision by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), to reject the Nice specimen as the lectotype and designate the Cayenne specimen in its place. The relevant petition to the ICZN has not yet been put forth.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Scleractinia is particularly challenging. Many species were described {{before the advent}} of scuba diving, with little realisation by the authors that coral species could have varying morphologies in different habitats. Collectors were mostly limited to observing corals on reef flats, and were unable to observe the changes in morphology that occurred in more turbid, deeper-water conditions. More than 2,000 nominal species were described in this era, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> nomenclature, the name given to the first described species has precedence over the rest, even when that description is poor, and the environment and even sometimes the country of the type specimen is unknown.|$|E

5|$|While Sawyer {{was serving}} overseas, the reform {{coalition}} swept the Democrats into power in Philadelphia {{for the first}} time in 67 years. When he returned to Philadelphia, Clark asked him to run for an at-large seat on City Council in 1955. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each political party could nominate five candidates and voters could only choose five. The result was that the majority party could take only five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. Sawyer was elected to one such seat and served a single four-year term. In that position, he sponsored legislation to establish the city's One Percent for Fine Arts program, which required one percent of the cost of construction projects in Center City to be spent on public art. He also worked for the creation of a Police Review Board. City Council did not pass that bill, but Mayor James Tate later created the board through an executive order.|$|E
