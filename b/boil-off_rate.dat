The USS Defiant was equipped with ablative armor in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual explains that it works in two stages: when the shields are hit by an energy or particle weapon, phaser or thermal energy from the ship is dissipated across the hull. This creates a <b>boil-off</b> <b>rate</b> that carries away most of the incoming beam's energy. Most of the time the boil-off creates a particle cloud that is dense enough to disperse the incoming beam. The USS Prometheus from Star Trek: Voyager was also equipped with ablative hull armor.|$|E

The liquid helium may be replenished as it boils away, at intervals between a few hours and several months, depending on the volume and construction of the cryostat. The <b>boil-off</b> <b>rate</b> is minimised by shielding the bath with either cold helium vapour, or vacuum shield with walls constructed from so-called super insulator material. The helium vapour which boils away from the bath very effectively cools thermal shields around {{the outside of the}} bath. In the older designs there may be additional liquid nitrogen bath, or several concentric layers of shielding, with gradually increasing temperatures. However, the invention of super insulator materials has made this technology obsolete.|$|E

The experiments are carried out in both DC and AC conditions and with and without an intermediate heat intercept. Current ranges are from 0 - 500 A for DC tests and 0 - 1, 000 A{sub rms} for AC tests. The leads are self-cooled.

An inside-tank process for scaled-up production of gelled liquid hydrogen was selected. No detectable gel structure degradation occurred during repeated shearing.

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} {{vent system}} for a cryogenic nitrogen tank was tested in a vacuum chamber simulating oxygen storage in low earth orbit. The nitrogen tank {{was surrounded by a}} cryo-shroud at - 40 F. The tank was insulated with two layers of multi-layer insulation. Heat transfer into cryogenic tanks causes phase change and increases tank pressure which must be controlled. A thermodynamic vent system was used to control pressure as the location of vapor is unknown in low gravity and direct venting would be wasteful. The thermodynamic vent system consists of a Joule-Thomson valve and heat exchanger installed on the inlet side of the tank mixer-pump. The combination is used to extract thermal energy from the tank fluid, reducing temperature and ullage pressure. The system was sized so that the tank mixer-pump operated {{a small fraction of the}} time to limit motor heating. Initially the mixer used sub-cooled liquid to cool the liquid-vapor interface inducing condensation and pressure reduction. Later, the thermodynamic vent system was used. Pressure cycles were performed until steady-state operation was demonstrated. Three test runs were conducted at tank fills of 97, 80, and 63 percent. Each test was begun with a boil-off test to determine heat transfer into the tank. The lower tank fills had time averaged vent rates very close to steady-state <b>boil-off</b> <b>rates</b> showing the thermodynamic vent system was nearly as efficient as direct venting in normal gravity...|$|R

40|$|Fluid network {{modeling}} with conjugate heat transfer has many applications in Aerospace engineering. In modeling unsteady flow with heat transfer, {{it is important}} to know the variation of wall temperature in time and space to calculate heat transfer between solid to fluid. Since wall temperature is a function of flow, a coupled analysis of temperature of solid and fluid is necessary. In cryogenic applications, modeling of conjugate heat transfer is of great importance to correctly predict <b>boil-off</b> <b>rate</b> in propellant tanks and chill down of transfer lines. In TFAWS 2003, the present author delivered a paper to describe a general-purpose computer program, GFSSP (Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program). GFSSP calculates flow distribution in complex flow circuit for compressible/incompressible, with or without heat transfer or phase change in all real fluids or mixtures. The flow circuit constitutes of fluid nodes and branches. The mass, energy and specie conservation equations are solved at the nodes where as momentum conservation equations are solved at the branches. The proposed paper describes the extension of GFSSP to model conjugate heat transfer. The network also includes solid nodes and conductors in addition to fluid nodes and branches. The energy conservation equations for solid nodes solves to determine the temperatures of the solid nodes simultaneously with all conservation equations governing fluid flow. The numerical scheme accounts for conduction, convection and radiation heat transfer. The paper will also describe the applications of the code to predict chill down of cryogenic transfer line and <b>boil-off</b> <b>rate</b> of cryogenic propellant storage tank...|$|E

The test apparatus is a fluid boil-off calorimeter system for calibrated measurement of the apparent thermal conductivity (k-value) of a specimen material at a fixed vacuum level.

Handling tools attach to the cold mass assembly for convenient manipulation of the assembly and for the installation or wrapping of insulation test materials. Liquid nitrogen is typically supplied to the inner vessel using a fill tube with funnel. A single port through the top of the vacuum chamber facilitates both filling and venting. Aerogel composite stacks with reflective films are fastened to the top and the bottom of the inner vessel as thermal guards.

40|$|This report uses readily {{available}} historical information to better define the volume, chemical composition, and Cs- 137 /Sr- 90 amounts for leaks {{that have occurred}} in the past for tanks SX- 108, SX- 109, SX- 111, and SX- 112. In particular a Historical Leak Model (HLM) is developed that is a month by month reconciliation of tank levels, fill records, and calculated <b>boil-off</b> <b>rates</b> for these tanks. The HLM analysis is an independent leak estimate that reconstructs the tank thermal histories thereby deriving each tank`s evaporative volume loss and by difference, its unaccounted losses as well. The HLM analysis was meant to demonstrate the viability of its approach, not necessarily to establish the HLM leak estimates as being definitive. Past leak estimates for these tanks have invariably resorted to soil wetting arguments but the extent of soil contaminated by each leak has always been highly uncertain. There is also a great deal of uncertainty with the HLM that was not quantified in this report, but will be addressed later. These four tanks (among others) were used from 1956 to 1975 for storage of high-level waste from the Redox process at Hanford. During their operation, tank waste temperatures were often as high as 150 C (300 F), but were more typically around 130 C. The primary tank cooling was by evaporation of tank waste and therefore periodic replacement of lost volume with water was necessary to maintain each tank`s inventory. This active reflux of waste resulted in very substantial turnovers in tank inventory as well as significant structural degradation of these tanks. As a result of the loss of structural integrity, each of these tanks leaked during their active periods of operation. Unfortunately, the large turnover in tank volume associated with their reflux cooling has made a determination of leak volumes very difficult. During much of these tanks operational histories, inventory losses because of evaporative cooling could have effectively masked any volume loss due to leak. However, careful comparison with reported tank levels during certain periods clearly show unaccounted volume losses for many tanks. As a result of the HLM analysis, SX- 108, SX- 109, SX- 111, and SX- 112 all show clear evidence of unaccounted volume losses during the period 1958 to 1975. Likewise, the HLM does not show similar unaccounted volume losses for tank SX- 105, a tank with no reported leak history, verifying that the HLM is consistent with SX- 105 not leaking. These unaccounted volume losses establish the leak start date and rate, and when propagated over time show that SX- 108 lost 203 kgal followed by SX- 109 at 111. SX- 111 at 55, and SX- 112 at 44 kgal. 0664 These leak volumes represent maximum or upper bounds estimates of each leak and are in total volume about six times the previous leak estimates...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the power}} draw, the mass transfer and the liquid mixing behaviour of boiling and hot sparged stirred tank reactors (STRs) were investigated. The power draw characteristics of six different impellers were studied under varying operating conditions and {{expressed in terms}} of the relative power draw, RPD. Generally the impellers showed considerably higher power draw in hot gassed than in comparable cold conditions. The main phenomenon in hot systems, the evaporation of liquid into a gas bubble suddenly exposed to it, was investigated experimentally. The growth of nitrogen and air bubbles in hot water was found to be very fast and be completed typically within milliseconds after their exposure to the liquid. This was confirmed by studies applying acoustic bubble sizing techniques which were carried out together with Richard Manasseh from CSIRO, Melbourne, Australia. Experimental studies of the gas-liquid mass transfer in hot sparged STRs were carried out using a tank of 450 mm in diameter agitated by a 180 mm Rushton turbine. Experiments involving the temperature kinetics in an air-water system and absorption and desorption of ammonia were used to determine gas and also some liquid side mass transfer coefficients. The gas side coefficients kga were found to be typically in the order of 0. 01 s- 1. An enhancement of the liquid side mass transfer was also observed. Both Fick and Stefan-Maxwell models were employed to express gas side mass transfer coefficients. The models predict there will be a decrease of the coefficients at high concentrations. In the hot sparged tank the temperature is essentially uniform throughout the STR.

40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{has been}} developed to implement an improved method of testing flat-plate specimens of thermal-insulation materials for cryogenic application. The method includes testing under realistic use conditions that could include vacuum and mechanical loading at a pressure up to 70 psi (= 0. 48 MPa). The apparatus can accommodate a rigid or flexible specimen having thickness up to 1. 25 in. (= 3. 2 cm) and diameters between 6 and 10 in. (about 15. 2 and 25. 4 cm, respectively). Typical test conditions include boundary temperatures between 77 K and 373 K and vacuum/interstitial gas filling at a pressure between 10 (exp - 6) torr (= 1. 3 x 10 (exp - 4) Pa) and 760 torr (atmospheric pressure = 0. 1 MPa). The interstitial gas could be N 2, He, CO 2, or any other suitable gas to which the insulation {{is expected to be}} exposed in use. Relative to prior apparatuses and testing methods, this apparatus and the testing method that it implements offer advantages of relative simplicity and ease of use. The basic principle of operation of the apparatus is that of boil-off calorimetry, using liquid nitrogen or any other suitable liquid that boils at a desired temperature below ambient temperature. Comparative rates of flow of heat through the thicknesses of the specimens (heat-leak rates) and apparent-thermal-conductivity values are obtained from tests of specimens. Absolute values of heat-leak rates and apparent thermal conductivities are computed from a combination of (1) the aforementioned comparative values and (2) calibration factors obtained by testing reference specimens of materials that have known thermal-insulation properties. The apparatus includes a full complement of temperature sensors, a vacuum pump and chamber, a monitoring and control system, and tools and fixtures that enable rapid and reliable installation and removal of specimens. A specimen is installed {{at the bottom of the}} vacuum chamber, and a cold-mass assembly that includes a tank is lowered into position above and around the specimen (see figure). A spring-based compensating fixture helps to ensure adequate thermal contact with possibly irregular specimen surfaces. For a high-compression test, the springs can be replaced with spacers. A flat circular load cell at the bottom of the chamber measures the compressive load on the specimen. Once the desired compressive-load, temperature, and vacuum/gas-filling conditions are established, testing begins. During a test, all measurements are recorded by use of a portable data-acquisition system and a computer. The total heat-leak rate is measured and calculated as the <b>boil-off</b> flow <b>rate</b> multiplied by the latent heat of vaporization. The parasitic heat leak (to the side of the specimen and to the top and side of the cold-mass tank) is reduced to a small fraction of the total heat leak by use of a combination of multilayer-insulation (MLI) shield rings, reflective film, a fiberglass/epoxy centering ring, and a bulk fill of aerogel beads. This combination eliminates the need for a cryogenic guard chamber used in a typical prior apparatus to reduce the parasitic heat leak...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA simple {{modeling}} {{of the heat}} transfer through insulating bilayers of cryogenic reservoir subjected to surrounding environment or aerothermal flux is presented. The model permits to determine the instantaneous evolution of maximum fuel temperatures and the <b>boil-off</b> <b>rate</b> {{as well as the}} possible insulation ablation. To get a realistic estimation of the maximum fuel temperature and boil-off loss, the good knowledge of the internal convection coefficient, taking into account the possible fuel ebullition, is indispensable. The aerothermal flux provokes the insulation degradation and its ablation. Because of the ablation, the reservoir becomes less and less thermally protected, which may cause an important fuel boil-off. Compared to classical insulations with uniform density, those with spatially graded densities appear as potential insulations permitting to meet both light-weight and low boil-off requirements.

Assuming that the recovery rate of BOG (r) is 0.7, the volume of gas losses (L t) for tanker transport can be calculated using Eq. (9). The L t,NG (Table  16) is the sum of the L t for pipeline transport and the L t for tanker transport.|$|E
40|$|The Soft Xray Spectrometer (SXS) {{instrument}} on-board the ASTRO-H X-ray {{mission is}} based on microcalorimeters operating at 50 mK. Low temperature is achieved by use of an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) cyclically operating up to a heat sink at either 1. 2 K or 4. 5 K. The 1. 2 K heat sink is provided by a 40 liter superfluid helium dewar. The parasitic heat to the helium from supports, plumbing, wires, and radiation, and the cyclic heat dumped by the ADR operation determine the liquid helium lifetime. To measure this lifetime we have used various techniques to rapidly achieve thermal equilibrium and then measure the <b>boil-off</b> <b>rate</b> of the helium. We have measured a parasitic heat of 650 microwatts and a cyclic heat of 100 microwatts {{for a total of}} 750 microwatts. This closely matches the predicted heat load. Starting with a fill level at launch of more than 33 liters results in a lifetime of greater than 4 years for the liquid helium. The techniques and accuracy for this measurement will be explained in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{bumpy torus}} {{facility}} consists of 12 superconducting coils, each 19 cm i. d. {{and capable of}} 3. 0 teslas on their axes. The coils are equally spaced around a toroidal array with a major diameter of 1. 52 m, and are mounted with the major axis of the torus vertical in a single vacuum tank 2. 6 m in diameter. Final shakedown tests of the facility mapped out its magnetic, cryogenic, vacuum, mechanical, and electrical performance. The facility is now ready {{for use as a}} plasma physics research facility. A maximum magnetic field on the magnetic axis of 3. 23 teslas was held for a period of more than sixty minutes without a coil normalcy. The design field was 3. 00 teslas. The steady-state liquid helium <b>boil-off</b> <b>rate</b> was 87 liters per hour of liquid helium without the coils charged. The coil array was stable when subjected to an impulsive loading, even with the magnets fully charged. When the coils were charged to a maximum magnetic field of 3. 35 teslas, the system was driven normal without damage...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} model to predict boil-off of stored propellant in large spherical cryogenic tanks has been developed. Accurate prediction of tank boil-off rates for different thermal insulation systems was {{the goal of}} this collaboration effort. The Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program, integrating flow analysis and conjugate heat transfer for solving complex fluid system problems, was used to create the model. Calculation of tank <b>boil-off</b> <b>rate</b> requires simultaneous simulation of heat transfer processes among liquid propellant, vapor ullage space, and tank structure. The reference tank for the boil-off model was the 850, 000 gallon liquid hydrogen tank at Launch Complex 39 B (LC- 39 B) at Kennedy Space Center, which is under study for future infrastructure improvements to support the Constellation program. The methodology employed in the {{numerical model}} was validated using a sub-scale model and tank. Experimental test data from a 1 / 15 th scale version of the LC- 39 B tank using both liquid hydrogen and liquid nitrogen were used to anchor the analytical predictions of the sub-scale model. Favorable correlations between sub-scale model and experimental test data have provided confidence in full-scale tank boil-off predictions. These methods are now being used in the preliminary design for other cases including future launch vehicle...|$|E
40|$|Long {{endurance}} flight, on {{the order}} of days, is a leading flight performance characteristic for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Liquid hydrogen (LH 2) is well suited to providing multi-day flight times with a specific energy 2. 8 times that of conventional kerosene based fuels. However, no such system of LH 2 storage, delivery, and use is currently available for commercial UAVs. In this paper, we develop a light weight LH 2 dewar for integration and testing in the proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell powered, student designed and constructed, Genii UAV. The fuel tank design is general for scaling to suit various UAV platforms. A cylindrical vacuum-jacketed design with removable end caps was chosen to incorporate various fuel level gauging, pressurizing, and slosh mitigation systems. Heat and mechanical loadings were modeled to compare with experimental results. Mass performance of the fuel tank is characterized by the fraction of liquid hydrogen to full tank mass, and the insulation performance was characterized by effective thermal conductivity and <b>boil-off</b> <b>rate.</b> P.

40|$|Liquid {{hydrogen}} (LH 2) {{takes up}} less storage volume than gas but requires cryogenic vessels. State-of-the-art applications for passenger vehicles consist of double-wall cylindrical tanks that hold a hydrogen storage mass {{of up to}} 10 kg. The preferred shell material of the tanks is stainless steel, since it is very resistant against hydrogen brittleness and shows negligible hydrogen permeation. Therefore, {{the weight of the}} whole tank system including valves and heat exchanger is more than 100 kg. The space between the inner and outer vessel is mainly used for thermal super-insulation purposes. Several layers of insulation foils and high vacuums of 10 - 3 Pa reduce the heat entry. The support structures, which keep the inner tank in position to the outer tank, are made of materials with low thermal conductivity, e. g. glass or carbon fiber reinforced plastics. The remaining heat inleak leads to a <b>boil-off</b> <b>rate</b> of 1 to 3 percent per day. Active cooling systems to increase the stand-by time before evaporation losses occur are being studied. Currently, the production of several liquid hydrogen tanks that fulfill the draft of regulations of the European Integrated Hydrogen Project (EIHP) is being prepared. New concepts of lightweight liquid hydrogen storage tanks will be investigated...|$|E
