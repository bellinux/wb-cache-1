5|$|Just as {{with other}} waves, moving into shallow water causes the tsunami to slow but grow in height. Either the trough or {{the crest of the}} tsunami can arrive at the coast first. In the former case, the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas unusually exposed. When the crest arrives, it does not usually break but rushes inland, {{flooding}} all in its path. Much of the disaster's destruction can be produced by these flood waters, which drain back into the sea while pulling people and debris along. Several tsunamis can be caused by a single geological event. In such cases, it is common for the later waves to arrive between eight minutes and two hours after the first, which may not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> or most destructive. Occasionally, in a shallow bay or estuary, a tsunami may transform into a bore.|$|E
5|$|Media {{attention}} was also {{directed at the}} teams' offensive capabilities. Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year in the week {{leading up to the}} game. In {{the first half of the}} 2007 season, Ryan had been prominently mentioned in candidate lists for the Heisman Trophy, college football's highest individual award. Although Ryan's late-game comeback in their previous game against Virginia Tech had made him a front-runner, the team's two subsequent losses to unranked teams dropped him from contention for the Heisman. Excellent performances in a division-clinching win at Clemson and against Miami seemed to return Ryan to Heisman-candidate form, however, and heading into the ACC Championship Game, Ryan appeared to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> offensive threat for Boston College.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began on}} 18 September 1967 {{with a budget}} of £83,000. Thirty-two {{thousand}} pounds was provided by AIP, with £12,000 for Price's expenditures and fees, and £20,000 for production costs. Philip Waddilove, a former BBC radio and record producer, contributed £5,000 in return for associate producer billing. Although the film would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> budgeted title in Tigon's history, for AIP their part of the budget represented a relatively small expenditure of money. Not much in terms of real quality was expected by AIP heads Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson, and the movie {{was intended to be}} nothing more than a tax write-off.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{combine to}} create the dump months, most of them {{circumstances}} particular to the United States and Canada, the primary market for most major Hollywood releases. Both periods immediately follow the times of {{year in which the}} distributors concentrate films they expect to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> critical and/or commercial successes, periods of increased spending on entertainment generally. While this often means that moviegoers have less disposable income afterwards, economics alone does not explain the dump months. The weather and competition from other forms of mass entertainment, especially professional sports, also play a part; the winter dump months are further affected by the Academy Awards eligibility rules.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} Munro, an {{excellent}} observer who spent years on Lānai, only saw the bird three times implies {{that it was}} already very rare by the 1910s. From 1900 to 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields. This conversion reduced {{the area of the}} hookbill's potential habitat, and is believed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> contributor to the species' extinction. It has also been suggested that avian malaria, which began affecting Lānai's birds in the 1920s, {{may have contributed to the}} species' decline. Likewise, the introduction of feral cats and rats to Lānai may have led to a decline in the hookbill's population. The extinction of local snails through human intervention could also have led to the Lānai hookbill's extinction.|$|E
5|$|Then the Colts faced their arch-rival New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. New England {{jumped to}} an early 21–3 lead, but Indianapolis stormed {{back in the second}} half, outscoring the Patriots 32–13 with an {{additional}} field goal late in the first half. With 2:22 left in the game, the Colts had the ball on their own 20-yard line trailing 34–31. On the first four plays of the drive, Manning completed three passes, moving the ball 69yards to the Patriots 11-yard line in just 24 seconds. Three plays later, Addai scored a 3-yard touchdown run to put them in the lead, 38–34 with only 60 seconds left in regulation. The Patriots responded with a drive to the Colts 45-yard line, but defensive back Marlin Jackson ended the drive with an interception to give Indianapolis the win. This happened to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> comeback in AFC-NFC Conference Championship history.|$|E

5|$|On 22 August 1958, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{announced}} a one-year moratorium on nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958, if the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom {{also agreed to}} suspend testing. Britain had already indicated that it would do so, and the Soviet Union agreed on 30 August. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, all three all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline. The British scientists needed to gather as much data as possible {{to allow them to}} design production nuclear weapons. Moreover, as the prospect of increased American cooperation grew after October 1957, they knew that {{the quality and quantity of}} what the Americans would share would depend on what they had to offer. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies such as the use of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride permitted a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices.
