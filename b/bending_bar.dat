40|$|Although {{the steel}} slit dampers {{commonly}} utilized for aseismic design approach can dissipate considerable energy {{created by the}} yielding of base materials, large residual deformation may happen in the entire frame structure. After strong external excitation, repair costs will be incurred in restoring a structure to its original condition and to replace broken components. For this reason, alternative recentering devices characterized by smart structures, which mitigate the damage for such steel energy dissipation slit dampers, are developed in this study. These devices, feasibly functioning as seismic restrainers, can be improved by implementing superelastic shape memory alloy (SMA) <b>bending</b> <b>bars</b> in a parallel motion with the steel energy-dissipating damper. The <b>bending</b> <b>bars</b> fabricated with superelastic SMAs provide self-centering forces upon unloading, and accordingly contribute to reducing permanent deformation in the integrated slit damper system. The steel slit dampers combined with the superelastic SMA <b>bending</b> <b>bars</b> are evaluated with respect to inelastic behavior as simulated by refined finite element (FE) analyses. The FE slit damper models subjected to cyclic loads are calibrated to existing test results {{in an effort to}} predict behavior accurately. The responses of the proposed slit damper systems are compared to those of the conventionally used slit damper systems. From the analysis results, it is concluded that innovative steel slit dampers combined with superelastic SMA <b>bending</b> <b>bars</b> generate remarkable performance improvements in terms of post-yield strength, energy dissipation, and recentering capability...|$|R
40|$|This paper mainly {{treats the}} seismic {{behavior}} of lead-rubber bearing (LRB) isolation systems with superealstic {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) <b>bending</b> <b>bars</b> functioning as damper and self-centering devices. The conventional LRB isolators that are usually installed at the column bases supply extra flexibility to the centrically braced frame (CBF) building {{with a view to}} elongate its vibration period, and thus make a contribution to mitigating seismic acceleration transferred from ground to structure. However, these base isolation systems are somehow susceptible to shear failure {{due to the lack of}} lateral resistance. In the construction site, they have been used to be integrated with displacement control dampers additionally withstanding lateral seismic forces. For this motivation, LRB isolation systems equipped with superelastic SMA <b>bending</b> <b>bars,</b> which possess not only excellent energy dissipation but also outstanding recentering capability, are proposed in this study. These reinforced and recentering LRB base isolators are modeled as nonlinear component springs, and then assigned into the bases of 2 D frame models used for numerical simulation. Their seismic performance and capacity in the base-isolated frame building can be evaluated through nonlinear dynamic analyses conducted with historic ground motion data. After comparative study with analyses results, it is clearly shown that 2 D frame models with proposed LRB isolators generally have smaller maximum displacements than those with conventional LRB isolators. Furthermore, the LRB isolation systems with superelastic SMA <b>bending</b> <b>bars</b> effectively reduce residual displacement as compared to those with steel <b>bending</b> <b>bars</b> because they provide more flexibility and recentering force to the entire building structure...|$|R

50|$|Amphiphysin is a brain-enriched protein with an N-terminal lipid interaction, {{dimerisation}} and membrane <b>bending</b> <b>BAR</b> domain, {{a middle}} clathrin and adaptor binding domain and a C-terminal SH3 domain.

A ubiquitous splice form of amphiphysin 2 that does not contain clathrin or adaptor interactions is highly expressed in muscle tissue and is involved in the formation and stabilization of the T-tubule network. In other tissues amphiphysin is likely involved in other membrane bending and curvature stabilization events.|$|E

Additionally, crack depth analyses on beveled samples depending on the crystal orientation of the investigated grains have been done by means of XRD measurements.

The tension straightening process mainly consisted of the elastic loading-I and unloading stage, the elastic loading-II and unloading stage, and the elastic–plastic loading stage, which {{were based on the}} stretch force change during straightening. The circular bar straightening under one-dimensional bending was investigated and assumed to be linear strain-hardening elastic–plastic material. According to the elastic–plastic mechanics theory, the mathematical displacement–force model of a tension straightening process established, on which was based, the predicted displacement of tension straightening for various original deflection was calculated. The tension straightening experiment for AZ 31 magnesium was conducted under the guidance of the predicted displacement.

40|$|The {{deformation}} behaviour of {{the highly}} textured Mg base wrought alloy AZ 31 subjected to tensile and compressive elasto plastic loading was characterized by means of synchrotron radiation. In former publications it was shown that there exists an asymmetry in the deformation behaviour of the investigated alloy, which {{can be related to}} the deformation mechanism of the hexagonal structure due to the crystallographic texture relative to the loading direction. A local X ray stress analysis was carried out on highly textured metal sheets for different hkil planes of the hexagonal crystal structure. The load transfer was investigated within in situ loading experiments in order to account for suitable XEC s, thus ensuring accurate stress evaluations. An X ray imaging method was applied in order to provide bending stress distributions with a high local resolution using synchrotron radiation beamline G 3, Hasylab DESY. Stress analyses were carried out on the side face of a <b>bending</b> <b>bar</b> being subjected to elasto plastic bending up to total strains in the outer layers of approximately 2. It is distinguished between loading stress distributions measured in in situ loading experiments as well as residual stress distributions monitored after unloading of elasto plastically bended bars.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. According to real-life crash data, {{one of the}} most harmful events among all side impacts is when the driverhead hits the {{far-side}} door when the car is hit from the far side. There is currently no established test method to simulate a crash where such an event is at risk of occurring. In order to assess real life injuries and develop countermeasures for far side crashes, standardized cost-effective test methods are needed. This paper presents a <b>bending</b> <b>bar</b> sled-test set-up simulating a full-scale 3 o’clock far side crash. In the full scale crash-test a deformable barrier with a speed of 65 km/h struck the passenger side of a passenger car with a BioSID in the driver seat. The intrusion of the vehicle was over when the dummy hit the far side door and therefore there was no requirement to simulate intrusion rate and extent in the sled test. The remaining part of the deformed vehicle was chopped in front of the instrument panel and behind the front seats and was then fastened transversely onto a sled. The intruded passenger side was fixed and reinforced. The mid-console, the passenger door-trim and the belt system were replaced. A BioSID was placed in the driver seat according to the full scale crash and the sled impacted the chosen set of iron bars with a resulting Δv of 24 km/h. As a result, the kinematics, accelerations and loading of the dummy were essentially the same as in the corresponding full scale crash. In conclusion, a sled test set-up can be used to assess real life injuries and in the development of dummies and countermeasures for far side crashes of similar types as considered in the paper...|$|E
40|$|In this STM study, {{nanostructures}} on metallic single crystals {{are observed}} under UHV conditions. The {{aim of the}} work at the Au(100) -surface is to evaluate an energetic quantity, namely the step free energy, from a topographic structure information. Adatom and vacancy islands are produced on the tempered reconstructed Au(100) -surface by evaporation of submonolayer quantities of gold and sputtering with Argon ions, respectively. As noted before, these islands have a rectangular shape with the long side oriented along the parallel reconstruction lines. The initial (aspect) ratio of the long to the short side is about 10. The decay of these islands is correlated with a decrease of the aspect ratio to approximately 1. After that the aspect ratio varies merely stochastically around this mean value. We could observe adatom islands at T = 353 K, which neither grow nor decay {{over a long period}} of time and whose aspect ratio varies stochastically around the mean value of 1. In conclusion, we assume that these islands are in a thermodynamic equilibrium situation or at least close to it. By averaging over these island shapes, we obtain the equilibrium shape for this temperature. From island shape fluctuations we make a quantitative determination of the mean step free energy to 170 meV per atom. In completely separated experiments from the described ones above, the formation of the so-called (2 x 1) oxygen stripe phase on Cu(110) is imaged in situ, and simultaneously a quantitative determination of the induced surface stress is accomplished. The <b>bending</b> <b>bar</b> technique is utilized with the bending measured by the STM. Due to the anisotropy of the Cu(110) surface, two experiments, one with the [1 (- 1) 0]- and a second one with the [001]-direction along the bar have to be carried out for a quantitative analysis of the induced surface stress. From the two experiments we calculate the induced stresses in both directions. We find that the difference of the surface stresses of the (2 x 1) O phase on Cu(110) and the clean Cu(110) surface is compressive for both directions, in accordance with the adsorption of oxygen on other surfaces. The stress depends significantly on the coverage. The data can be fitted with an exponential function. Furthermore the fit for the stress difference orthogonal to the stripes is used for a quantitative analysis of the periodicity of the oxygen stripes...|$|E

40|$|Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) {{manufactures}} {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT) ceramics for use in {{applications that}} {{take advantage of their}} unique electrical properties. Due to the low fracture toughness and failure strength of PZT ceramics, crack initiation and propagation during component fabrication (grinding and poling), storage, and acceptance testing can result in premature product failure. Recent research suggests that the mechanical properties of PZT can be enhanced by an exposure to a silicon carbide (SiC) nanopowder thermal treatment, potentially increasing production yield and decreasing production costs. In an effort to establish a SiC nanopowder thermal treatment/mechanical property enhancement relationship for PZT manufactured by SNL, <b>bend</b> <b>bars</b> with dimensions of 3 x 4 x 45 mm were thermally treated with SiC nanopowder at temperatures ranging from 650 °C to 900 °C for 2 hour intervals.

To begin developing an understanding of the potential strengthening mechanisms, diffusion depths of SiC into the PZT microstructure will be characterized using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy.

In this study, we aim at realizing ultrasonic linear motor with the diameter less than 10 mm {{as an alternative to}} small air cylinder actuators. We propose a new stator structure using two PZT elements between two parallel <b>bending</b> <b>bars.</b> The PZT elements are bonded at the position of several mm from the bar end. In this structure, both bar ends vibrate resonantly in a bending mode, and high vibration displacement amplitude can be obtained along the bars. The length between the PZT element and the bar end determines the optimum driving frequency. The slider simply consists of three metal plates, which sandwich the <b>bending</b> <b>bars,</b> and the preload can be controlled by springs. The conditions in which the traveling wave can be generated along the bars were investigated. When the bars vibrate in a symmetric mode and traveling waves are generated, the slider moves in the direction to the opposite of traveling wave. Traveling wave could be generated by controlling the driving phase difference between the two PZT elements. It was found that the phase differences depend on the distance between the two PZT elements. We experimentally achieved the stroke of 10 mm and the thrust of 78 mN at 23 kHz...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: For {{some years}} ceramic bearing balls based on silicon nitride have been {{routinely}} used in technical practice. An important property of bearing balls is their strength, but appropriate testing methods are still missing. In this paper four different methods for strength testing {{are applied to}} commercial bearing balls. Each of the tests needs {{a different type of}} specimen, their preparation needs a very different effort, and the stress state applied to the specimens is also very different. This causes pros and cons, which are discussed in detail. The conventional 4 -point bending test characterises the material in the interior of the balls. The applied stress state is uniaxial. The machining of the <b>bending</b> <b>bars</b> out of the balls is time intensive and costly. The ball on three balls test also characterises interior of the balls. The stress state is biaxial. The machining of the disc shaped specimens out of the balls is less expensive than the production of <b>bending</b> <b>bars,</b> but the finish of the tensile loaded surface needs special care. The data of both types of tests can be converted into each other using Weibull theory. The specimens in the triple ball crush test are as-received bearing balls, which are squeezed together. This causes some kind of contact loading, as will also occur in service. Failure is caused by the creation and growth of contact cracks, followed by a collapse of the compressed and cracke...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this work was to {{investigate}} and expand on previously carried out research into elastic-plastic crack tip fields using the first two terms of the Williams expansion to characterise the degree of crack tip constraint. As a precursor to this research a history of fracture mechanics is also presented. In the present work crack tip fields in small scale yielding have been detennined using modified boundary layer formulations {{in an attempt to}} model the influence of the second order term of the Williams expansion, the T -stress. The prime object of this thesis was to investigate and expand on previously carried out research into a two parameter characterisation of elastic-plastic crack tip fields using the second parameter of the Williams expansion(T), which attempts to characterise the degree of crack tip constraint. Modified Boundary Layer formulations in conditions of plane strain were implemented to derive a suitable reference solutions, against which the effects of out of plane strains can be compared and the validity of presently established reference fields can be gauged. The effect of out of plane non-singular stress, S, on the crack tip stress field were also considered, where constraint was largely determined by T. A wide range of analyses have been carried out, from the microstructural scale to complete engineering components in an attempt to characterise crack tip stress fields. The ability to apply two parameter fracture concepts to real engineering structures requires methods for calculating T for complex components with realistic semi-elliptical defects. A simple engineering method for achieving this was developed making use of linespring elements in the finite element package ABAQUS. This approach was validated by the calculation of T for semi-elliptical cracks at the chord-brace intersection of a tubular welded joint, modelled using the mesh generation program PATRAN. The micromechanics of cleavage, using the Ritchie-Knott-Rice model have also been constructed. This work relates the ratio of J for unconstrained and constrained geometries to critical microstructural distance, critical cleavage stress and the toughness ratio on the strainhardening effect. The elastic-plastic behaviour of short and deeply cracked <b>bend</b> <b>bars</b> has previously been described by Betegon and Hancock based on the first two terms of the Williams expansion. A local cleavage criterion has been applied to these fields to indicate the effect of loss of constraint on lower shelf toughness of shallow cracked <b>bend</b> <b>bars.</b> The work models the maximum temperature at which cleavage can occur in these geometries to show the effect of constraint and aJW ratio of cracked <b>bend</b> <b>bars</b> on the ductile-brittle transition temperature. This has also been backed by a significant experimental research program. Finally constraint dependent toughness has been considered in relation to failure assessment methodologies. A simple engineering method for modifying these Failure Assesssment Diagrams has been presented, this consists of considering the constraint matched toughness of the strucutre. This procedure recovers the original Failure Assessment Line and unifies the constraint dependent fracture toughness within defect assessment schemes which utilise Failure Assessment Diagrams...|$|R
