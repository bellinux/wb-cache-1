5000|$|As {{a result}} of this reshuffling, Graf Wassilko became Landeshauptmann, with Smal-Stotskyi as his lieutenant. Their arrival to power brought with the {{adoption}} of Straucher's democratic reform. There followed liberal and nationalist bills (including the establishment <b>of</b> a state <b>bank,</b> the <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> propination laws, {{and the creation of a}} Romanian History Chair at Francis Joseph University), but the more radical measures proposed by the PȚD were vetoed by Koerber. Soon after, the Fellowship began rupturing around ethnic lines. This had been a backup option for Onciul, who had vetoed Graf Wassilko's proposal to fuse the distinct Fellowship clubs into unitary, non-ethnic, sections.|$|R
50|$|When the {{aircraft}} <b>banks,</b> the <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> the wings no longer acts vertically, {{and so the}} force directly upwards is reduced (by the cosine <b>of</b> the <b>bank</b> angle). If left uncorrected this will result in {{the aircraft}} descending. The nose will also usually drop. In order to maintain level flight the pilot will apply back-pressure to the stick while the wings are banked. This will maintain level flight. The airspeed will usually decrease slightly as a result of this. For steeper bank angles an aircraft pilot will usually increase the power setting to keep the speed up.|$|R
40|$|Group lifting {{structures}} {{are introduced to}} provide an algebraic framework for studying <b>lifting</b> factorizations <b>of</b> two-channel perfect reconstruction finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter banks. The lifting factorizations generated by a group lifting structure are characterized by Abelian groups of lower and upper triangular lifting matrices, an Abelian group of unimodular gain scaling matrices, and a set <b>of</b> base filter <b>banks.</b> Examples <b>of</b> group <b>lifting</b> {{structures are}} given for linear phase <b>lifting</b> factorizations <b>of</b> the two nontrivial classes of two-channel linear phase FIR filter banks, the whole- and half-sample symmetric classes, including both the reversible and irreversible cases. This covers the lifting specifications for whole-sample symmetric filter banks in Parts 1 and 2 of the ISO/IEC JPEG 2000 still image coding standard. The theory is used to address the uniqueness <b>of</b> <b>lifting</b> factorizations. With no constraints on the lifting process, it is shown that lifting factorizations are highly nonunique. When certain hypotheses developed in the paper are satisfied, however, lifting factorizations generated by a group lifting structure are shown to be unique. A companion paper applies the uniqueness results proven in this paper to the linear phase group lifting structures for whole- and half-sample symmetric filter banks.

50|$|If {{the total}} lift is kept constant, the {{vertical}} component <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> will decrease. As {{the weight of}} the aircraft is unchanged, this would result in the aircraft descending if not countered. To maintain level flight requires increased positive (up) elevator to increase the angle of attack, increase the total lift generated and keep the vertical component <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> equal with {{the weight of the}} aircraft. This cannot continue indefinitely. The total load factor required to maintain level flight {{is directly related to the}} bank angle. This means that for a given airspeed, level flight can only be maintained up to a certain given angle <b>of</b> <b>bank.</b> Beyond this angle <b>of</b> <b>bank,</b> the aircraft will suffer an accelerated stall if the pilot attempts to generate enough lift to maintain level flight.|$|R
5000|$|A canal {{will often}} need some means to {{maintain}} a water level. A canal constantly consumes water due to leakage, evaporation, and the operation <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> locks. Nevertheless, excess water from storms or emptying locks [...] could cause problems eroding the <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> a canal, causing washouts, and flooding buildings or adjacent properties. Waste weirs were one of several items used to remove surplus water. The waste weir also functioned as an opening to drain the entire canal prism of water for repairs, or for winter (to avoid damage from freezing water), or in anticipation of flooding.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} fifteen years central banks have been taking steps towards greater {{monetary}} policy transparency. This paper uses a vector error correction model (VECM) to investigate the role transparency has had on changing the dynamics of the credit channel of the Australian monetary policy transmission mechanism. The Reserve <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> Australia (RBA) <b>lifted</b> all interest rate restrictions in 1986, and then started to announce changes in the cash rate in January 1990 giving the financial system a clearly defined indication of its monetary policy stance. Furthermore, the RBA formalised its inflation targeting operating objective in 1996. This paper gives a clear indication of how a more transparent framework has affected the setting <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> lending rates over three distinct periods. Our results show that responsiveness <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> lending rates to monetary policy changes improved in each period corresponding to an innovation in monetary policy transparency. Moreover, Anticipation effects in banking lending rates are evident only in the period after the RBA formalised its inflation targeting operating objective in 1996. This suggests that Banks only changed lending rates once they had learnt that the RBA was communicating a credible commitment to change the path of future short-term interest rates. However, other results show that price discrimination has been evident between the business and household sectors. To our knowledge, this analysis is the first study that looks at the issue <b>of</b> central <b>bank</b> transparency on bank lending rates.

Let the reader imagine himself for a moment withdrawn from the sounds and motion of the living world, and sent forth alone into this wild and wasted plain. The earth yields and crumbles beneath his foot, tread he never so lightly, for its substance is white, hollow, and carious, like the dusty wreck of the bones of men. The long knotted grass waves and tosses feebly in the evening wind, and the shadows of its motion shake feverishly along the <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> ruin that <b>lift</b> themselves to the sunlight. Hillocks of mouldering earth heave around him, as if the dead beneath were struggling in their sleep. Scattered blocks of black stone, four-square remnants of mighty edifices, not one left upon another, lie upon them to keep them down. A dull purple poisonous haze stretches level along the desert, veiling its spectral wrecks of massy ruins, on whose rents the red light rests, like dying fire on defiled altars; the blue ridge of the Alban Mount lifts itself against a solemn space of green, clear, quiet sky. Watch-towers of dark clouds stand steadfastly along the promontories of the Apennines. From the plain to the mountains, the shattered aqueducts, pier beyond pier, melt into the darkness, like shadowy and countless troops of funeral mourners, passing from a nation's grave.|$|R
