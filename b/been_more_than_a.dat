25|$|For the 1996 season, Oklahoma hired former player John Blake as head coach. Blake was the {{favorite}} to succeed Schnellenberger and {{was backed by}} Barry Switzer, Steve Owens, and former Oklahoma president George Lynn Cross. However, many were skeptical of Oklahoma's choice for the new coach. His coaching experience was very limited, especially compared to his predecessor. In his seven-year coaching career (four years at OU, three years with the Dallas Cowboys and one year at Tulsa), he had never <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> position coach. The skeptics were proven right. In Blake's first season, he went 3–8. It was the worst record, percentage wise, Oklahoma had experienced since 1895 and is tied for the most losses in one year (along with Blake's 1997 squad) to this very day. In his three years at Oklahoma, Blake went 3–8, 4–8, and 5–6 for a final record of 12–22. It {{was the first time}} since 1922–1924 that Oklahoma had three consecutive losing seasons. Blake's largest contribution to the team was his recruiting. He set the stage by recruiting several players that would help lead the program's resurgence, including J.T. Thatcher, Josh Norman, Roy Williams and Rocky Calmus. Many of them got a chance to play fairly quickly, since Blake's teams were often out of games early. Blake was fired after the 1998 season.|$|E

500|$|Isocrates {{claimed that}} [...] "not {{even the most}} {{worthless}} slave can {{be put to death}} without trial"; the master's power over his slave was not absolute. Draco's law apparently punished with death the murder of a slave; the underlying principle was: [...] "was the crime such that, if it became more widespread, it would do serious harm to society?" [...] The suit that could be brought against a slave's killer was not a suit for damages, as would be the case for the killing of cattle, but a [...] (dikē phonikē), demanding punishment for the religious pollution brought by the shedding of blood. In the 4th century BC, the suspect was judged by the Palladion, a court which had jurisdiction over unintentional homicide; the imposed penalty seems to have <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> fine but less than death—maybe exile, {{as was the case in}} the murder of a Metic.|$|E
500|$|Since 2002, {{the festival}} has <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> small setup of stalls. [...] It {{has grown to}} be a camp of up to 120stalls, where life in medieval times is enacted by {{participants}} of the battle and their families. [...] The beer tent is a regular fixture, and the stalls peddle herbs, sweets, and food. [...] Entertainers, such as acrobats, fire-eaters, and jugglers, wander the area, performing their arts. [...] Musicians and dancers also entertain visitors. [...] Re-enactors demonstrate pottery, yarn spinning, and other medieval craft. [...] These enthusiasts come from foreign countries, such as Belarus and Hungary. [...] The German Mittelalter rock band Schelmish has performed several times at the festival. [...] Short bouts of simulated duels are performed in the camp and a jousting tournament was also featured. [...] The festival has attracted visitors from as far as New Zealand and {{the west coast of}} the United States; the local tabloid quoted an estimate of 25,000visitors to the festival in 2003.|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} of crowds in Australia was slightly different. According to Justin Parkinson, {{in his book}} {{on the history of}} English legspin, they took to [...] "calling Bosanquet 'Elsie', a tribute to the elaborate, supposedly effeminate jumpers he wore." [...] They also named the googly delivery a [...] "Bosie". However, this may have <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> simple shortening of his name. According to Parkinson, it may have referred to the nickname ("Bosey") of Lord Alfred Douglas who was widely known to have had a homosexual affair, a criminal act at the time, with Oscar Wilde. This remained a topical subject, and the source of humour, in Australia. Parkinson suggests that the anonymous originator of the name [...] "Bosie" [...] for the googly must have been aware of the association. He also notes that the other common term in Australia for the googly was [...] "wrong 'un", which was slang for both [...] "criminal" [...] and [...] "homosexual". Parkinson suggests that these two terms for the googly, the nickname [...] "Elsie", were attempts to [...] "label the whole English ruling class as effete".|$|E

500|$|O'Mahoney and Winter {{began working}} on the film in 2006. Winter had watched a film called The Women's Story, about two Iraqi women who had journeyed {{around the country and}} filmed what they saw. They wanted to make a {{documentary}} about [...] "the people never seen on the evening news, [...] presidents, prime ministers, generals and militants ... claiming to know something of Iraq's future". Winter explained that [...] "all these documentaries coming out of Iraq were done for or by adults. Iraqi children had not <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> UN statistic about the dead, kidnapped or injured", so they decided to concentrate on what they viewed as the [...] "real source of Iraq's future" [...] – teenagers. [...] "I wanted {{to tell the story of}} Iraq in a different way. As journalists, we do stories about kids and teenagers, but we don't hear from them. If you go to the UN reports, they are just a number and that's it." [...] O'Mahoney was a little more reticent; he had recently worked in Iraq but did not wish to return due to the civil war and the deteriorating condition of the country. When it was decided to use a school as a backdrop to the story, which could also be used to provide a chronological narrative, O'Mahoney and Winter realised it would be too dangerous for the students to be seen with either a Western or Iraqi camera crew because it would draw too much attention to them, and so they decided that the students would film the documentary themselves.|$|E
500|$|Ceawlin is {{the second}} king in Bede's list. [...] All the {{subsequent}} bretwaldas followed more or less consecutively, {{but there is a}} long gap, perhaps fifty years, between Ælle of Sussex, the first bretwalda, and Ceawlin. [...] The lack of gaps between the overlordships of the later bretwaldas has been used to make an argument for Ceawlin's dates matching the later entries in the Chronicle with reasonable accuracy. [...] According to this analysis, the next bretwalda, Æthelberht of Kent, must have been already a dominant king by the time Pope Gregory the Great wrote to him in 601, since Gregory would have not written to an underking. [...] Ceawlin defeated Æthelberht in 568 according to the Chronicle. [...] Æthelberht's dates are a matter of debate, but recent scholarly consensus has his reign starting no earlier than 580. [...] The 568 date for the battle at Wibbandun is thought to be unlikely because of the assertion in various versions of the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List that Ceawlin's reign lasted either seven or seventeen years. [...] If this battle is placed near the year 590, before Æthelberht has established himself as a powerful king, then the subsequent annals relating to Ceawlin's defeat and death may be reasonably close to the correct date. [...] In any case, the battle with Æthelberht is unlikely to have <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> few years on either side of 590. [...] The gap between Ælle and Ceawlin, on the other hand, has been taken as supporting evidence for the story told by Gildas in De Excidio of a peace lasting a generation or more following a Briton victory at Mons Badonicus.|$|E

2500|$|Affectionately nicknamed [...] "Go" [...] and towering at {{a whopping}} five-foot [...] "ape", the Gorilla is the Phoenix Suns {{favorite}} primate. Most notably, fans {{are familiar with}} the Gorilla for his on the court antics where he raises the Phoenix Suns flag in the name of team-pride, performs notorious slam dunk routines and fires up the crowd. From his early days in the Banana Republic to his education at Fur-man University, the Gorilla has always had a passion for basketball. Before his debut with the Phoenix Suns, the Gorilla delivered singing telegrams. However, in 1980 the Gorilla's fate changed when he stepped onto the court during a game and surprised unsuspecting players and fans. His antics became an instant hit and the Gorilla {{has been a member of}} the Phoenix Suns ever since. Since then, the gorilla, has been known for his slapstick humor during the games such as his stadium stairs all to the sound of the Rocky Theme, and the fantastic dunks that are performed before each 4th quarter. The Gorilla would do a few push-ups on the court, then head off in a quest to climb the stairs of both the lower and upper level of the Coliseum to get to the top. When he reached the base of the upper level, he’d stop for a second to soak up the applause, then head to the top of the building. When he got there, the crowd would explode. It never failed. Also, one of his more beloved skits was at a Knicks home game where he came out to Frank Sinatra's Theme from New York, wearing a hat, with several pieces of garbage stuck to his leg. Halfway through the song, a group of [...] "muggers" [...] attacked him, and he staggered off the court afterwards. Give him credit, The Gorilla has always <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> slapstick comedian. In a way, though, that's what makes The Gorilla so much fun. He's not really there just to cheer on the Suns – although he does so with great enthusiasm. The Gorilla just wants to have fun, and wants the rest of us to have fun with him.|$|E

2500|$|The 20th century Reform Rabbi Gunther Plaut {{noted the}} {{difficulty}} that [...] {{says that it}} is , YHVH, who guarantees the covenant made with the ancestors, although they did not know God by this Name, but this contradicts the frequent occurrence of the name , YHVH, in Genesis, implying that the forefathers knew the Name. Plaut reports that Biblical scholars have attempted to solve this contradiction in various ways, many positing that [...] belongs to the Priestly source, which held that the Patriarchs knew God only as Elohim or El Shaddai, and that God first disclosed the Name , YHVH, to Moses. According to this theory, the passages in Genesis that use the Name , YHVH, and the passages in [...] that refer to , YHVH, are assigned to the J tradition. Adherents of this theory argue that in [...] the P school connected , YHVH, with Moses to establish the legitimacy of the priestly hierarchy. Acknowledging that this explanation does not address the text as it is now, Plaut presented the alternative explanation (which Plaut attributed to the Israeli scholar Yehezkel Kaufmann) that Moses and the people had since patriarchal time known the Name , YHVH, as God's name, but this knowledge had hardly <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> “customary appellation.” In [...] however, after his first trials and failures, Moses confronted God again, and this time God revealed the Name more fully, {{which is to say that}} Moses saw God more clearly than before, in a new light. Turning to the etymology of the Name, Plaut reported that the most widely accepted explanation connects the Name with the word hayah, [...] "to be", a causative form of which could be Yahveh, “one who causes to be.” Another form could be Yahuah, “he who indeed will (show himself to) be,” or “he who proves himself.” Plaut reported a different theory holds that the name was read Yahuh, a version of Yehu, a form that occurs several times independently in the Bible as [...] and frequently as a prefix or suffix to proper names. According to Martin Buber, Yahu was a kind of “primitive sound,” an exclamation denoting awe, recognition, and affirmation: “Oh is the one!” or “Yah is the one!” or “Yah is!” or “Yah exists!” Finally, Plaut related yet another approach, seeing , YHVH, as having developed from a cultic name connected with El, perhaps El du Yahwi – “El who creates” – and that in time the Name Yahwi split off from El, ousting the Name El from preeminence.|$|E
