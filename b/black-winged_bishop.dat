50|$|The <b>black-winged</b> red <b>bishop</b> is a {{gregarious species}} which feeds on seed, grain and some insects.|$|R
50|$|The <b>black-winged</b> red <b>bishop</b> (Euplectes hordeaceus), {{formerly}} known in southern Africa as the fire-crowned bishop, is a resident breeding bird species in tropical Africa from Senegal to Sudan and south to Angola, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.|$|R
50|$|The <b>black-winged</b> red <b>bishop</b> is {{a stocky}} 13-15 cm bird. The {{breeding}} male is scarlet {{apart from his}} black face, belly and wings and brown tail. The conical bill is thick and black. He displays prominently, singing high-pitched twitters from tall grass, puffing out his feathers or performing a slow hovering display flight.|$|R
50|$|A {{study of}} the {{molecular}} phylogeny of bishops and widowbirds published in 2008 found that it formed part of a clade along with the fire-fronted <b>bishop</b> (E. diadematus), <b>black-winged</b> red <b>bishop</b> (E. hordeaceus), northern red bishop (E. franciscanus), southern red bishop (E. orix), Zanzibar red bishop (E. nigroventris) and red-collared widowbird (E. ardens). An alternate common name is Gierow's bishop.|$|R
50|$|The {{yellow-crowned bishop}} was first {{described}} by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789. It and the fire-fronted bishop have occasionally been placed in the separate genus Taha but DNA places it in Euplectes, without close relatives however. In captivity it has interbred with the northern red bishop. Alternate common names include: Golden bishop, Napoleon <b>bishop,</b> Napoleon weaver, <b>black-winged</b> golden <b>bishop,</b> goudgeelvink (in Afrikaans), Napoleonwever (in Dutch), euplecte vorab√© (in French), Napoleonweber (in German), and obispo coronigualdo (in Spanish).|$|R
50|$|When Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert first {{described}} the red-collared widowbird from a South African specimen in 1783, he named it Fringilla ardens, assigning it to a genus of Old World finches. In 1829, William John Swainson created Euplectes, {{and moved the}} widowbirds and bishops from Fringilla into this new genus. Traditionally, Euplectes is thought to contain two clades, with the bishops in one clade and the widowbirds in another. However, molecular {{evidence suggests that the}} red-collared widowbird is actually a long-tailed bishop rather than a true widowbird. In captivity, they have been successfully bred with southern red bishop, yellow-mantled widowbird, fan-tailed widowbird, and <b>black-winged</b> red <b>bishop.</b>|$|R
