500|$|Gehry {{publicly}} blamed Dworsky: [...] "The executive architect {{was incapable}} of doing drawings that had this complexity. We helped select that firm. I went to Daniel, supposedly a friend, and I said, 'This is going to fail and {{we now have the}} capability to do it, so let us ghost-write it.'" [...] Dworsky refused. Gehry was also quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying: [...] "We had the wrong executive architect doing the drawings. I helped pick him, I'm partly responsible. It brought us to a stop."" [...] Gehry told Los Angeles magazine in 1996 that he [...] "no longer speaks to his former friend (Dworsky)". Gehry continued his public attacks on Dworsky: [...] "He (Dworsky) made a lot of money. He <b>begged</b> <b>me</b> for the job. I'd like to shoot him." ...|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky {{played the}} finale of his Second Symphony, subtitled the Little Russian, at a {{gathering}} at Rimsky-Korsakov's house in Saint Petersburg on January 7, 1873, before the official {{premiere of the}} entire work. To his brother Modest, he wrote, [...] "he whole company almost tore me to pieces with rapture—and Madame Rimskaya-Korsakova <b>begged</b> <b>me</b> in tears to let her arrange it for piano duet". Rimskaya-Korsakova was a noted pianist, composer and arranger in her own right, transcribing works by {{other members of the}} kuchka {{as well as those of}} her husband and Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet. Borodin was present and may have approved of the work himself. Also present was Vladimir Stasov. Impressed by what he had heard, Stasov asked Tchaikovsky what he would consider writing next, and would soon influence the composer in writing the symphonic poem The Tempest.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of this day I was taking a walk with the steward of the convent in the neighbourhood, and as we returned, towards sunset, he <b>begged</b> <b>me</b> to take some refreshment {{with him in his}} cell. Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming our former subject of conversation, he said: [...] "And I, too, have read a Septuagint" [...] – i.e. a copy of the Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from {{the corner of the room}} a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out of the basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.|$|E

2500|$|Her next play, The Drag, {{dealt with}} homosexuality, and was what West {{called one of}} her [...] "comedy-dramas of life". After a series of try-outs in Connecticut and New Jersey, West {{announced}} she would open the play in New York. However, The Drag never opened on Broadway due to efforts by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice to ban any attempt by West to stage it. West explained,"the city fathers <b>begged</b> <b>me</b> not to bring the show to New York {{because they were not}} equipped to handle the commotion it would cause." [...] West was an early supporter of the women's liberation movement, but said she was not a [...] "burn your bra" [...] type feminist. Since the 1920s, she was also an early supporter of gay rights.|$|E
2500|$|In early June, {{while he}} was still only 17, Grace made his first visit to Sheffield, {{deputising}} for his brother E. M. Grace who was busy with his medical duties. The match was the last one recorded at the old Hyde Park Ground. As Grace later recalled, the ground [...] "stood {{on the top of a}} high hill, and I began to despair of the cab ever getting to the top". He captained eighteen Colts of Nottinghamshire and Sheffield against the All-England Eleven, his team losing by an innings. Grace scored 9 in the first innings and 36 (out of 91) in the second. He said in his memoir that [...] "the All-England team were anxious to catch the train to get away to some other part of the country and they <b>begged</b> <b>me</b> to get out", but he would not throw away his wicket. Simon Rae wrote that the game was [...] "an important test of character which he undoubtedly passed".|$|E

Among the most enthusiastic of these was Mr Frank Miles, the artist. I learned afterwards that he saw me one evening at the theatre, and {{tried in vain to}} discover who I was. He went to his clubs and among his artist friends declaring he had seen a beauty, and he described me to everybody he knew, until one day one of his friends met me and he was duly introduced. Then Mr Miles came and <b>begged</b> <b>me</b> to sit for my portrait. I consented, and when the portrait was finished he sold it to Prince Leopold. From that time I was invited everywhere and made a great deal of by many {{members of the royal family}} and nobility. After Frank Miles I sat for portraits to Millais and Burne-Jones and now Frith is putting my face in one of his great pictures." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 56, {{he married}} Li Shuxian, a {{hospital}} nurse, on 30 April 1962, in a ceremony held at the Banquet Hall of the Consultative Conference. From 1964 until his death he worked as an editor for the literary department of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, where his monthly salary was around 100 yuan. One yuan in the 1960s was equivalent to about 40 cents USD. Li recalled in a 1995 interview that: [...] "I found Pu Yi a honest man, a man who desperately needed my love {{and was ready to}} give me as much love as he could. When I was having even a slight case of flu, he was so worried I would die, that he refused to sleep at night and sat by my bedside until dawn so he could attend to my needs". Li also noted like everybody else who knew him that Puyi was an incredibly clumsy man, leading her to say: [...] "Once in a boiling rage at his clumsiness, I threatened to divorce him. On hearing this, he got down on his knees and, with tears in his eyes, he <b>begged</b> <b>me</b> to forgive him. I shall never forget what he said to me: 'I have nothing in this world except you, and you are my life. If you go, I will die'. But apart from him, what did I ever have in the world?".|$|E
2500|$|On 20 April 1932, the Lytton Commission {{arrived in}} Manchuria to begin its {{investigation}} to establish if Japan had committed aggression or not. Puyi {{was interviewed by}} Lord Lytton, and recalled thinking {{that at the time}} that he desperately wanted to ask Lytton for political asylum in Britain, but as General Itagaki was sitting right next to him at the meeting, he told Lytton that [...] "the masses of the people had <b>begged</b> <b>me</b> to come, that my stay here was absolutely voluntary and free". After the interview, Itagaki told Puyi: [...] "Your Excellency's manner was perfect; you spoke beautifully". The diplomat Wellington Koo, who was attached to the Lytton Commission as its Chinese assessor received a secret message saying that [...] "...a representative of the imperial household in Changchun wanted to see me and had a confidential message for me". The representative, posing as an antique dealer, who [...] "...told me he was sent by the Empress: She wanted me to help her escape from Changchun. He said she found life miserable there because she was surrounded in her house by Japanese maids. Every movement of hers was watched and reported". Koo said he was [...] "touched", but he could do nothing to help Wanrong escape, which her brother Rong Qi said was the [...] "final blow" [...] to her, leading her into a downward spiral. Right from the start, the Japanese occupation had sparked much resistance by guerrillas, whom the Kwantung Army called [...] "bandits". General Doihara was able for in exchange for a multi-million bribe to get one of the more prominent guerrilla leaders, the Hui Muslim general Ma Zhanshan to accept Japanese rule, and had Puyi appoint him Defense Minister. Much to the intense chagrin of Puyi and his Japanese masters, Ma's defection turned to be ruse, and only months after Puyi appointed him Defense Minister, Ma took his troops over the border to the Soviet Union to continue the struggle against the Japanese.|$|E
