40|$|The {{employment}} of viscoelastic {{materials for the}} passive control of noise and vibration transmitted through panels made of composite material is widely considered as an effective solution in the aerospace field. In the following paper a modelling technique based on the finite elements method able to describe the dynamic properties of a typical fuselage panel is implemented and numerically validated: natural frequencies and damping properties of a panel treated by viscoelastic layer are evaluated. This technique is essentially based on: proper choice of structural elements for the model of panel, proper link of the different elements and a correct description of the boundary conditions. Different models {{have been developed for}} a long panel with high width over thickness ratio such to be considered infinite: a 2 D model; a 3 D model consisting in all brick elements and a 3 D model consisting in shell elements for the structural top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> and in <b>brick</b> elements for the damping layer. In this last case much care has been paid for the description of the boundary conditions. Once validated the technique for infinite panels, a finite element model of a panel supported on the four sides with a damping layer integrated in the mid plane has been developed and the results have been compared with an analytical solution available in literature. The comparison showed a good agreement between the dynamic properties predicted by the technique herein presented and the ones provided by the analytical model and confirmed the care that should be paid for a proper choice of the constraints well representing the structural behaviour of the pane...|$|R
40|$|A WIG(Wing-In-Ground effect) craft flies {{close to}} the water surface by {{utilizing}} a cushion of relatively high pressurized air between its wing and water surface. This implies that when one designs such craft {{it is important to}} have lightweight structures with adequate strength to resist external loads with some margins. To investigate this requirement, this paper deals with the structural analysis of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> of small WIG craft having a design landing weight of 1. 2 -ton. As building materials for the WIG craft, pre-preg carbon/epoxy composites are considered. The strength information of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> is obtained using the first-ply-failure analysis in conjunction with a mid-plane symmetric laminated plate theory. As a result, the first-ply-failure location, load and deflection of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> are obtained. The calculated strength information is compared with the water reaction load for the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> of seaplanes considered when they land on the water surface –the same fluid-structure interaction mechanism as that of WIG craft. In the calculation of seaplane water reaction load information, the rules shown in FAR(Federal Aviation Regulations) Part 25 are used.

The aims of the use of the cross-corrugated absorbing <b>plate</b> and <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> is to enhance the turbulence and the heat-transfer rate inside the air flow channel, which are crucial to the improvement of efficiencies of solar air-heaters. To quantify the achievable improvements with the cross-corrugated absorbing and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates,</b> flat-plate solar air-heaters which have both a flat absorbing plate and a flat <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> are also considered. The thermal performance of these three types of solar air-heaters are analyzed, measured and compared under several configurations and operating conditions. All the analytical and experimental results show that, although the thermal performance of the type 2 heater is just slightly superior to that of the type 1 heater, both of these cross-corrugated solar air-heaters have a much superior thermal performances to that of the flat-plate one. It is also found that the use of selected coatings on the absorbing plates of all the heaters considered can substantially enhance the thermal performances of the heaters, whereas such a selected coating on the <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> or/and the glass covers does not have such a significant effect on the thermal performances of the heaters.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} parametric {{study has}} been carried out in this paper on the thermal performance of cross-corrugated solar air collectors. These collectors consists of a wavelike absorbing plate and a wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> which are crosswise positioned to form the air flow channel. Two types of these collectors are considered. For the Type 1 collector, the wavelike shape of the absorbing plate is along the flow direction and that of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> is perpendicular to the flow direction, while for the Type 2 collector it is the wavelike shape of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> that is along the flow direction and that of the absorbing plate is perpendicular to the flow direction. The aim of the use of the cross-corrugated absorbing <b>plate</b> and <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> is to enhance the turbulence and the heat transfer rate inside the air flow channel which are crucial to the improvement of efficiencies of solar air collectors. To quantify the achievable improvements with the cross-corrugated absorbing and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates,</b> a flat-plate solar air collector which has both a flat absorbing plate and a flat <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> is also considered. The thermal performance of these three types of solar air collector are analyzed and compared under various configurations and operating conditions.

It is also found that to achieve a higher collector efficiency, it is essential to construct the collectors having slender configurations along the air flow direction, to maintain a small mean gap between the absorbing <b>plate</b> and <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> to use selected coatings on the absorbing plate and glass cover, to maintain a higher air mass flow rate, and to operate the collectors with the inlet fluid temperature close to that of the ambient fluid...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the thermal}} {{performance}} of cross-corrugated and v-groove solar air collectors {{has been compared}} under {{a wide range of}} configuration and operating conditions. For cross-corrugated collectors, the air flow channel is formed by the wavelike absorbing plate and the wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> which are transversely positioned, whereas for v-groove collectors it is formed by the v-groove absorbing plate and the flat <b>bottom</b> <b>plate.</b> The use of the transversely positioned wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> in cross-corrugated collectors is to achieve better thermal performance by enhancing the heat transfer rate inside the air flow channel via augmented turbulence. It is found that cross-corrugated collectors are superior to v-groove ones for all the configurations and operating conditions considered, confirming that the use of the transversely positioned wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> in cross-corrugated collectors improves the thermal performance. The results also show that a slender configuration along the air flow direction, a small gap between the absorbing <b>plate</b> and the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> a selected coating on the absorbing plate and the glass cover that has a very high absorptivity of solar radiation but quite a small emissivity of thermal radiation, an air mass flow rate per unit area of collector above 0. 1 kg/m 2 ·s, and maintaining the inlet fluid temperature close to that of the ambient fluid, will lead to improved thermal performance for both collectors. However, it is found that the mean gap between the cover and the absorbing plates, thexemissivity of thermal radiation of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> the solar insolation, and the inclination of the collectors have negligible effects on the efficiencies of both collectors...|$|R
40|$|A single film (typical {{of a film}} in a foam) {{moving in}} a {{confined}} geometry (i. e. confined between closely spaced top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates)</b> is analysed via the viscous froth model. In the first instance the film {{is considered to be}} straight (as viewed from above the top plate) but is not flat. Instead it is curved (with a circular arc cross-section) in the direction across the confining plates. This curvature leads to a maximal possible steady propagation velocity for the film, which is characterised by the curved film meeting the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> tangentially. Next the film is considered to propagate in a channel (i. e. between top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> and sidewalls, with the sidewall separation exceeding that of the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates).</b> The film is now curved along as well as across the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates.</b> Curvature along the plates arises from viscous drag forces on the channel sidewall boundaries. The maximum steady propagation velocity is unchanged, but can now also be associated with films meeting channel sidewalls tangentially, a situation which should be readily observable if the film is viewed from above the top plate. Observed from above, however, the film need not appear as an arc of a circle. Instead the film may be relatively straight along much of its length, with curvature pushed into boundary layers at the sidewalls...|$|R

40|$|Water {{infiltration}} in wood frame walls {{leads to}} different water transport phenomena: water runoff and spreading {{of water on}} the sheathing, water infiltration into the insulation, water flow on the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> and into the bottom plate-sheathing joint, water uptake by sheathing, stud and <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> and leakage of water from the joint sheathing-bottom plate. A laboratory test was designed to quantify the different transport flows. For the water infiltration rates and duration tested, water infiltration into the insulation and leakage are found likely to occur. Water uptake and spreading {{of water on the}} sheathing can lower these flows. OSB and fibreboard show no spreading. The spreading of plywood depends on the surface characteristics and fiber direction. Leakage will more likely occur at high infiltration rates. The amounts of water flowing on the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> and taken up by the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> are more limited. Water infiltrating at the stud and flowing down the stud into the stud-bottom plate joint, will be substantially taken up by the stud in longitudinal direction...|$|R

In {{order to be able to}} easily test components with basic designs a modular fixture has also been designed, manufactured and evaluated within the scope of this thesis. Implementation of the proposed guidelines for fixture design is most importantly argued to enable power transfer between the component and fixture during testing that as far as possible resembles the power transfer that takes place when the component is mounted on/in an actual vehicle. Using the standardized <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> and producing new fixtures to fit the same hole pattern is argued to decrease the work load for each vibration test considerably.

40|$|Using a new phase-contrast microscopy-based {{method of}} analysis, {{sedimentation}} {{has recently been}} demonstrated to be the major mass transport mechanism of bacteria towards substratum surfaces in a parallel plate flow chamber (J. Li, H. J. Busscher, W. Norde, J. Sjollema, Colloid Surf. B. 84 (2011) 76). Here we describe a novel method for enumerating adhesion of fluorescent bacteria in a parallel plate flow chamber that allows direct imaging of the bacterial distribution {{along the length of}} the flow chamber, as caused by sedimentation. Imaging of fluorescence was done using macroscopic bio-optical imaging of the entire flow chamber, including top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> as well as of the flowing suspension in between. An algorithm is forwarded that allows to separate the fluorescence arising from the suspension and <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> and at the same time determines the single cell fluorescence from which the bacterial distribution over the entire <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> can be visualized. Enumeration of the numbers of bacteria adhering to the center of the glass <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> for a fluorescent Staphylococcus aureus strain was found to coincide with enumerations using phase-contrast microscopy. Moreover, due to the use of macroscopic bio-optical imaging, it was found that the number of adhering staphylococci increases linearly with distance from the inlet of the flow chamber, which could be explained from a simplified mass balance of convection, sedimentation and blocking near the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> of the flow chamber.
