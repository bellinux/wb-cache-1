The most important exceptions — i.e. state laws that survive {{despite the fact that}} they may relate to an employee <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> — are state insurance, banking, or securities laws, generally applicable criminal laws, and domestic relations orders that meet ERISA's qualification requirements.|$|E

25|$|ERISA {{does not}} require that an {{employer}} provide health insurance to its employees or retirees, but it regulates the operation of a health <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> if an employer chooses to establish one.|$|E
25|$|The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibits {{a health}} <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> from refusing to cover an employee's {{pre-existing}} medical conditions in some circumstances.

40|$|Due to {{the recent}} {{economic}} decline {{and the desire to}} enact large-scale health reform, the current federal regulation of pension plans, health plans, and other employee <b>benefit</b> <b>plans</b> has received considerable congressional attention. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) provides a comprehensive federal scheme for the regulation of employee pension and welfare <b>benefit</b> <b>plans</b> offered by private-sector employers. ERISA contains various provisions intended {{to protect the rights of}} plan participants and beneficiaries in employee <b>benefit</b> <b>plans.</b> This report provides background on the pension laws prior to ERISA, discusses various types of employee <b>benefit</b> <b>plans</b> governed by ERISA, provides an overview of ERISA’s requirements, and includes a glossary of commonly used terms...|$|R

25|$|Consumer {{satisfaction}} {{results have}} been mixed. While a 2005 survey by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association found widespread satisfaction among HSA customers, a survey published in 2007 by employee benefits consultants Towers Perrin came to the opposite conclusion; it found that employees currently enrolled in such plans were significantly less satisfied with many elements of the health <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> compared to those enrolled in traditional health benefit plans.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s and 2000s, many {{employers}} who promised lifetime health coverage to their retirees limited or eliminated those benefits. ERISA {{does not provide}} for vesting of health care benefits {{in the way that}} employees become vested in their accrued pension benefits. Employees and retirees who were promised lifetime health coverage may be able to enforce those promises by suing the employer for breach of contract, or by challenging the right of the health <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> to change its plan documents to eliminate promised benefits.|$|E

Increases in the plan's liabilities due to benefit improvements, changes in actuarial assumptions, and any other reasons were amortized and charged to the account; decreases in the plan's liabilities were amortized and credited to the account. Every year, the employer was required to contribute the amount necessary to keep the funding standard account from falling below $0 at year-end.|$|E

The plea was the response to a criminal complaint filed two days earlier, which stated {{that over the past}} 20 years, Madoff had defrauded his clients of almost $65 billion in the largest Ponzi scheme in history. Madoff insisted he was solely responsible for the fraud. Madoff did not plea bargain with the government. Rather, he {{pleaded guilty to}} all charges. It has been speculated that Madoff pleaded guilty instead of cooperating with the authorities in order to avoid naming any associates and co-conspirators who were involved with him in the scheme.|$|E
2500|$|A three-part {{analysis}} {{is used to}} decide whether ERISA preempts state law. [...] First, preemption is presumed if the state law “relates to” any employee <b>benefit</b> <b>plan.</b> [...] Second, a state law relating to an employee <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> may be protected from preemption under ERISA if it regulates insurance, banking, or securities. [...] The third step of the ERISA preemption analysis concerns the “deemer” clause. [...] State insurance regulation may be saved {{only to the extent}} that it regulates genuine insurance companies or insurance contracts. [...] As a result, a state may not “deem” that an employee <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> is an insurance plan in an effort to sidestep preemption if the <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> would not otherwise meet the requirements as an insurance company or contract. [...] The “deemer” clause therefore restricts the use of the “savings” clause to conventionally insured employee benefit plans.|$|E
50|$|The IRS {{monitors}} defined <b>benefit</b> <b>plans</b> such as 401(k)s {{to determine}} if they are top-heavy, or weighted too heavily in providing benefits to key employees. If the plans are too top-heavy, the company must remedy this by allocating funds to the other employees' (known as non-key employees) <b>benefit</b> <b>plans.</b>|$|R
50|$|For pension <b>plan</b> sponsors, target <b>benefits</b> <b>plan</b> {{provide more}} {{flexibility}} than traditional defined benefit or defined contribution <b>plans.</b> Defined <b>benefit</b> <b>plans</b> provide {{a high degree}} of benefit certainty for members, but for plan sponsors contribution rates are more uncertain and funding costs can be high. Defined <b>benefit</b> <b>plans</b> can also contribute to intergeneration inequality, as retired members continue to receive benefits, whether or not those benefits were adequately pre-funded. The reverse is true for defined contribution plans where the contribution certainty comes at the cost of complete benefit uncertainty.|$|R
50|$|ERISA is {{a federal}} law that sets minimum {{standards}} for employee <b>benefit</b> <b>plans,</b> including pension <b>plans</b> and health <b>benefit</b> <b>plans,</b> in private industry within the United States. ERISA neither requires an employer to establish a pension plan, with few exceptions, nor dictates what benefits must be offered; instead, it requires that employers who establish plans meet certain minimum standards. The law is designed {{for the protection of}} plan participants, and to ensure a uniform statutory body of law regulating applicable <b>benefit</b> <b>plans,</b> throughout every jurisdiction in the country.|$|R
