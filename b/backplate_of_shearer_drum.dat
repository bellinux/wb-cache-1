40|$|Longwall shearers usually {{suffer from}} {{excessive}} pick and pickholder consumptions and severe wear <b>of</b> the <b>backplate</b> <b>of</b> the clearance ring section <b>of</b> <b>shearer</b> <b>drums.</b> In practice, {{most of the}} drums were seen to be withdrawn from the face due to the abovementioned problems, while vane picks and their holders were intact due to the improper lacing design of the clearance ring picks. However, few underground investigations and their results {{on the effect of}} lacing arrangement of clearance picks on the service life <b>of</b> <b>shearer</b> <b>drums</b> have been published. Nevertheless, the pick consumption characteristics <b>of</b> <b>shearer</b> <b>drums</b> were not investigated in detail, since these are fewer pick consumptions with shearers when compared to roadheaders. This paper is concerned with the comprehensive in situ trials on the effect of lacing of clearance ring picks on the lifespan <b>of</b> <b>shearer</b> <b>drums,</b> and the pick consumption characteristics of longwall shearers at Cayirhan Coal Mine in Turkey. The lifespan <b>of</b> <b>shearer</b> <b>drums</b> employed with shearers in this mine increased 70 per cent, while the consumption rate of clearance ring picks decreased three fold through using an alternative lacing for clearance picks, indicating the significance of utilizing proper design techniques for clearance ring picks for the service life <b>of</b> <b>shearer</b> <b>drums.</b> Statistical analyses carried out, using the raw pick consumption data, implied that the clearance ring picks experienced much higher loads than vane picks, revealing that special attention must be paid to designing clearance ring picks. An average maximum consumption value of 41 was determined for clearance ring picks, with corner-cutting picks having the most replacements, while it was 35 for vane picks, on three-day based pick replacements...|$|R

40|$|The {{poor coal}} loading {{performance}} <b>of</b> a <b>shearer</b> <b>drum</b> primarily restricts the widespread application <b>of</b> the <b>shearer</b> and affects the mining efficiency in thin seam mining.

And then, the cutting tests were carried out on the cutting testbed of coal and rock for the new <b>shearer</b> <b>drum</b> and an existed drum. To understand both {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the two drums, test parameters such as the cutting specific consumption, the load fluctuation, and the lump coal percentage of the drums were compared based on the same rotary speed and the initial haulage speed. And the two drums had the same vane starts, the same pick arrangement, and the number of total picks. The results indicate that the cutting lump coal percentage of the new drum is better than the existed drum and the lump percentage of the new drum increases by 3 % over the existed drum. At the same time, the cutting specific consumption of the drums is nearly the same, but the load fluctuation of the new drum is bigger...|$|R

40|$|The {{effective}} {{production of}} high-quality anthracite has attracted increasing global attention. Based on the coal occurrence in Yongxia Mining Area and mining conditions of a coalface in Xinqiao Coal Mine, {{we proposed a}} systematic study on the technical support {{for the production of}} high-quality anthracite. Six key steps were explored, including coal falling at the coalface, transport, underground bunker storage, main shaft hoisting, coal preparation on the ground, and railway wagon loading. The study resulted in optimized running parameters for the shearers, and the rotating patterns <b>of</b> the <b>shearer</b> <b>drums</b> was altered (one-way cutting was employed). Mining height and roof supporting intensity were reduced. Besides, loose presplitting millisecond blasting and mechanized mining were applied to upgrade the coal quantity and the lump coal production rate. Additionally, the coalface end transloading, coalface crush, transport systems, underground storage, and main shaft skip unloading processes were improved, and fragmentation-prevention techniques were used in the washing and railway wagon loading processes. As a result, the lump coal production rate was maintained at a high level and fragmentation was significantly reduced. Because of using the parameters and techniques determined in this research, high-quality coal production and increased profits were achieved. The research results could provide theoretical guidance and methodology for other anthracite production bases...|$|R
