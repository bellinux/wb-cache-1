40|$|The {{discipline}} of pathology plays {{a crucial role}} in the process of identifying and defining the health effects of exposure to compounds. The characterization of morphological alterations of laboratory animals after exposure is a significant step in this process. Histology of lymphoid organs has been found quite sensitive in a number of studies, including interlaboratory validation studies, although it did not flag every model immunotoxic substance. This is related to two aspects. First, the immune system <b>by</b> <b>its</b> <b>very</b> dynamic <b>nature</b> manifest a bandwidth in its morphological picture, hence the ‘normal’ state can be quite variable. Second, more subtle interferences of toxic compounds, for example, in cell traffic, specific actions on cell subsets with a distinct function, transmembrane signaling, and cell activation are often not detectable by conventional histological assessments. In the interpretation of quantitative changes, it should be noted that particular components of the lymphoid organs may be decreased in number (suppressed–involuted) or increased (stimulated–expanded), but that does not necessarily reflect the overall effects on the immune system. For proper hazard identification, interspecies- and intrastrain-dependent differences in the histophysiology of lymphoid organs should be taken into account, as well as the functional and morphological changes in lymphoid organs during life.

The concept is largely avoided in contemporary legal and political theory.

An adequate {{analysis of}} a Central European ex-communist social system will probably find within it the following four layers of social interaction: the state, society, civil society and various communities ranging from families to religious communities. The state, far from being omnipotent, has <b>by</b> <b>its</b> <b>nature</b> <b>very</b> limited powers to regulate religious matters.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the fictionalisation of reality {{as a creative}} response to the human condition in novels selected from the prewar writings of Jean Giono where, through an emerging portrait of the artist/poet as healer, the author explores the contention {{that the power of}} the creative mind has the strength to master reality. Across these early works, we will identify the permanence of an inner tension between "reality" and the "dream" within the human mind, as Giono' s characters struggle with the uniqueness of their position in a seemingly alien universe. The dream arises from a desire for unification {{with the rest of the}} natural world, while reality must acknowledge that humankind is excluded from such a union on account of its specificity. The analysis will uncover Giono's ongoing attempt at achieving a solution to the existential problem facing humankind through a marriage of human creativity with the power of the cosmic forces, expressed through the spoken/written word. Through the subjective imagination of his emerging poet-protagonists, the author celebrates and endeavours to sustain an illusory external world of contrasts which challenge everyday perspectives but which are also striking in their interdependence. The inherent duality of the poetic metaphor, with its two domains of reference, makes it the keystone of a cosmos which is composed of a series of binary oppositions. <b>By</b> <b>its</b> <b>very</b> analogous <b>nature,</b> metaphor reveals an underlying interconnectedness to the vastness of the universe which is a persistent theme in all art - the revelation of universals. For Giono, the strength of the natural life force correlates to a force of poetry that is capable of releasing humans from the servitude of ordinary life by introducing them to a universal world that holds more ontological truth than the restrictions of an immediate, apparent reality...|$|R

6000|$|These remarks {{are almost}} the {{necessary}} preface to {{a consideration of}} the existence of Shelley and Landor at Oxford--the Oxford of 1793- 1810. Whatever the effects may be on Shelleyan commentators, it must be said that, to the donnish eye, Percy Bysshe Shelley was nothing more or less than the ordinary Oxford poet, of the quieter type. In Walter Savage Landor, authority recognised a noisier and rowdier specimen of the same class. People who have to do with hundreds of young men at a time are unavoidably compelled to generalise. No don, that was a don, could have seen Shelley or Landor as they are described to us without hastily classing them in the category of poets who would come to no good and do little credit to the college. Landor went up to Trinity College in 1793. It was the dreadful year of the Terror, when good Englishmen hated the cruel murderers of kings and queens. Landor was a good Englishman, of course, and he never forgave the French the public assassination of Marie Antoinette. But he must needs be a Jacobin, and wear his own unpowdered hair--the Poet thus declaring himself at once in the regular recognised fashion. [...] "For a portion of the time he certainly read hard, but the results he kept to himself; for here, as at Rugby, he declined everything in the shape of competition." [...] (Now competition is the essence of modern University study.) [...] "Though I wrote better Latin verses than any undergraduate or graduate in the University," [...] says Landor, [...] "I could never be persuaded by my tutor or friends to contend for any prize whatever." [...] The pleasantest and most profitable hours that Landor could remember at Oxford [...] "were passed with Walter Birch in the Magdalen Walk, by the half-hidden Cherwell." [...] Hours like these are indeed the pleasantest and most profitable that any of us pass at Oxford. The one duty which that University, <b>by</b> virtue of <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature,</b> has never neglected, is the assembling of young men together from all over England, and giving them three years of liberty of life, of leisure, and of discussion, in scenes which are classical and peaceful. For these hours, the most fruitful of our lives, we are grateful to Oxford, as long as friendship lives; that is, as long as life and memory remain with us. And, [...] "if anything endure, if hope there be," [...] our conscious existence in the after-world would ask for no better companions than those who walked with us by the Isis and the Cherwell.|$|R

40|$|Successfully {{developing}} a software product from the scratch until launching {{to the market}} is not simple. This is the day-by-day of many startups, whose existence is based on building and selling scalable products. But what if a company built on a business model that is, <b>by</b> <b>its</b> <b>nature,</b> <b>very</b> different from startups, decided to venture into product development? This study analyzes a consulting firm that decided to develop and commercialize a Software as a Service (SaaS). Results show that, although the business drive is clear, several challenges must to be overcome for a consulting firm to operate closer to how a startup would. According to theory, consulting firms have high variable costs bound to consultants’ wages, causing the operating expenses to increase {{at the same rate}} as the revenue. In comparison, technology startups have higher fixed costs typically linked to licenses and developers’ salaries, operating with low variable costs, what creates potential to scale revenue faster than the operating expenses. By analyzing the financial figures of a real consulting firm, this theory was proven to be valid, and therefore, despite of achieving outstanding growth, scaling in the consultancy model is limited. Thus, this work explores well-consolidated theoretical frameworks for startups to successfully develop and launch products to the market, and in parallel, it dives deep into a real consulting firm’s processes, practices, and challenges for {{developing a}} SaaS. The analysis within this firm is done by first looking into project documents for elements that communicate the steps for developing the case product. To complement the analysis and discover the underlying practices and challenges in this process, members of the development team were surveyed and observed during a workshop to co-create the value proposition of the case product. Findings show that, even though the process is found to be closer to the traditional product development, an iterative approach with continuous learning was in use. Also, the team pointed out a lack of understanding on the potential customers, and the feeling that an internal competition for resources was compromising the workforce of the development team. Finally, discussions about the value proposition revealed difficulties for the company to detach itself from a consulting mindset towards a startup-oriented thinking. Although there are challenges, there are also ways to systematically overcome them, uncovering a better track to successfully accomplish such endeavor...|$|R

If a beneficiary cannot be found despite strenuous steps to find one, the trustees can apply for a Benjamin Order, named after the case of Re Benjamin, which authorises them to distribute the property as if the beneficiary is dead. The final type of uncertainty is administrative unworkability — where the trust is, <b>by</b> <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature,</b> so impractical that the trustees cannot carry out their duties.
