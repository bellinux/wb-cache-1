5|$|I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> large {{statue in}} ceramic, the Tueuse ("The Murderess"), is an {{exceptional}} piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, {{it would look}} very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money.|$|E

2500|$|Six {{months after}} the {{establishment}} of Israel, the Bergson Group was dissolved, followed by a dinner in New York City where former Irgun commander Menachem Begin appeared, saying, [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> people, liberated and re-assembled in its country, will contribute its full share toward the progress of all mankind ... that all of Palestine eventually would be free, and that peace and brotherhood would prevail among Arabs and Jews alike." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I wait but {{for your}} forgiveness," [...] said the knight, still kneeling, [...] "for <b>my</b> {{presumption}} in <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> poor services {{could have been}} required or valued by you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Five o'clock.--I was {{not mistaken}} in <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> nerves were all unstrung. Trifles {{that would not}} have cost me a second thought at other times weigh heavily on my mind now.|$|R
2500|$|... "Lee {{seemed to}} delight in {{making fun of}} a suicidal 16-year-old who was treated for {{depression}} with electroshock treatments", Turnipseed recalled. [...] "In fact, my struggle with depression as a student was no secret. I had talked {{about it in a}} widely-covered news conference as early as 1977, when I was in the South Carolina State Senate. Since then, I have often shared with appropriate groups the full story of my recovery to responsible adulthood as a professional, political and civic leader, husband and father. Teenage depression and suicide are major problems in the United States, and I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> life story offers hope to young people who are suffering with a constant fear of the future".|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the editors}} had a {{difficult}} time finding someone to write the series, with Tim Hunter proving a tricky character to get right: although he already appeared in a mini-series, the character's main function had been to bear witness to the past, present and future of magic in the DC universe and so did not offer a writer much detail to work with. [...] Karen Berger eventually settled on writer John Ney Rieber to continue Tim's story, who expanded Tim's character using his own memories of being fourteen, later saying, [...] "I don't <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> soul is likely to be shuffled off to Purgatory after I die. [...] What would be the point? I've been fourteen already." [...] Rieber utilized his own teenage confusion and delight in writing Tim, while introducing his first girlfriend Molly as a counterpoint: Molly was the opposite of Tim in nearly every way, someone [...] "who'd already figured out the best thing you could possibly do with your life was live it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Quicksilver {{is searching}} for his sister in Wundagore when Magneto and the Young Avengers go to find the Scarlet Witch. After trying to abduct his nephew Wiccan so he can assist him in finding his sister, he is stopped by {{his father and his}} other nephew, Speed. After Wiccan {{suggests}} that maybe Magneto actually did want to make up for his past, he became angry and said, [...] "Nephew the last time I allowed myself to <b>believe</b> <b>that.....</b> <b>My</b> father tried to kill me". Quicksilver prepares to fight his father but when debris from his rampage strikes his sister it is found that the Scarlet Witch there is actually a Doombot in disguise.

2500|$|Jeff Koons rose to {{prominence}} in the mid-1980s {{as part of a}} generation of artists who explored the meaning of art in a media-saturated era. He gained recognition in the 1980s and subsequently set up a factory-like studio in a SoHo loft on the corner of Houston Street and Broadway in New York. It was staffed with over 30 assistants, each assigned to a different aspect of producing his workin a similar mode as Andy Warhol's Factory (notable because all of his work is produced using a method known as art fabrication). Today, he has a [...] factory near the old Hudson rail yards in Chelsea, working with 90 to 120 regular assistants. Koons developed a color-by-numbers system, so that each of his assistants could execute his canvases and sculptures {{as if they had been}} done [...] "by a single hand". [...] "I think art takes you outside yourself, takes you past yourself. I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> journey has really been to remove my own anxiety. That's the key. The more anxiety you can remove, the more free you are to make that gesture, whatever the gesture is. The dialogue is first with the artist, but then it goes outward, and is shared with other people. And if the anxiety is removed everything is so close, everything is available, and it's just this little bit of confidence, or trust, that people have to delve into." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That is my affair," [...] she {{answered}} simply. [...] "First of all, though, I {{should go to}} Mr. Deane, and I should ask him to help me. Any man of common sense would agree with me at once in <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> uncle was robbed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{but with}} the consent of the Bishop, who, I think, <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> locum got on better in the parish than I do, as no doubt was the case, I, too, have volunteered for the Front, and been {{accepted}} as a chaplain of the 201st Division." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She remembers not the sorrows {{which have}} befallen us," [...] the Doña Maria would say with tearful eyes, that each day grew larger as the rings of sorrow deepened beneath them.

5000|$|In February 2005, Daley denied {{complicity}} in the unfolding scandal saying, [...] "Anyone who <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> interest in public life is in enriching my family, friends or political supporters doesn't know or understand me at all.

6000|$|Courthorne {{nodded as}} if in comprehension. [...] "Well, I'm {{probably}} not consistent, but one rarely quite loses touch with everything, and if I <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> kinswoman was growing fond of a beggarly farmer, I'd venture to put a sudden stop to your love-making. This, at least, is perfectly bona fide, Witham." ...|$|R
6000|$|MABEL. [Staring at him] How {{can you do}} it? What do you want? What's your motive? You can't {{possibly}} <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{husband is}} a thief! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Really, Miss Harmer," [...] the Doctor said, [...] "you alarmed me for {{a moment}} into <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> old friend had met his end by foul play. Sophy's conduct is inexcusable, and I do not wish to enter into any defence of it; but still she can hardly be termed a murderess." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1951, Albert Schweitzer gave AWI {{permission}} {{to strike a}} medal in his honor, to be presented for outstanding achievement in the advancement of animal welfare.
