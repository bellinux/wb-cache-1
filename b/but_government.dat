5|$|In July 1994 {{one of his}} sons, Norodom Chakrapong, led {{a failed}} coup attempt to topple the government. Following the coup attempt, Chakrapong took refuge in a hotel in Phnom Penh, <b>but</b> <b>government</b> troops soon {{discovered}} his hideout and surrounded the hotel. Chakrapong called Sihanouk, who negotiated with government representatives {{to allow him to}} go into exile in Malaysia. The following November, Sirivudh was accused of plotting to assassinate Hun Sen and imprisoned. Sihanouk intervened to have Sirivudh detained at the interior ministry's headquarters, convinced that there was a secret plan to kill the latter if he were to remain in prison. After Sirivudh was relocated to the safer location, Sihanouk appealed to Hun Sen that Sirivudh be allowed to go into exile in France together with his family. Subsequently, Hun Sen accepted his offer.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} coin {{shortages}} beginning in 1959, and the United States Bureau of the Mint expanded production {{to try to}} meet demand. The early 1960s {{was a time of}} increased use of silver both in the coinage and in industry, putting pressure on the price of silver, which was capped at just over $1.29 per ounce by government sales at that price. The silver in a dollar's worth of quarters would be worth more as bullion than as money if the price of the metal rose past $1.38 per ounce, and there was widespread hoarding of silver coins. Demand for the Kennedy half dollar as a collectable drove it from circulation after its debut in 1964. The Bureau of the Mint increased production, helping reduce the coin shortages by May 1965, <b>but</b> <b>government</b> stocks of silver were being rapidly reduced, and threatened to run out by 1968. After extensive study by the Treasury Department, President Lyndon B. Johnson in June 1965 recommended that Congress pass legislation to allow for silverless dimes and quarters, and debased silver half dollars. Although there was some opposition, mainly from legislators representing Western mining states, the bill progressed rapidly through Congress, and was enacted with Johnson's signature on July 23, 1965.|$|E

25|$|Records {{show that}} Irish lands {{exported}} food {{even during the}} worst years of the Famine. When Ireland had experienced a famine in 1782–83, ports were closed to keep Irish-grown food in Ireland to feed the Irish. Local food prices promptly dropped. Merchants lobbied against the export ban, <b>but</b> <b>government</b> in the 1780s overrode their protests. No such export ban happened in the 1840s.|$|E

25|$|During the Famine, Ireland {{produced}} enough food, flax, {{and wool}} {{to feed and}} clothe double its nine million people.

Merchants lobbied against the export ban, <b>but</b> <b>government</b> in the 1780s overrode their protests. There was no such export ban in the 1840s. Some historians have argued that in this sense the famine was artificial, caused by the British government's choice not to stop exports.|$|E
25|$|The notable {{exception}} was the Fox Chase/Newtown branch. With {{the aid of}} public funding {{from the city of}} Philadelphia, the line was electrified as far as Fox Chase (the last station within city limits) in September 1966. Electrification was to be completed through to Newtown in the 1970s, <b>but</b> <b>government</b> subsidies were not readily available, leaving the Fox Chase-Newtown section as the lone non-electrified suburban commuter route on the Reading system. Passenger service between Fox Chase and Newtown was terminated on January 14, 1983 under the auspices of SEPTA.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, the British, French and German governments {{agreed to}} start {{development}} of the 300-seat Airbus A300. BAC argued against the proposal in favour of their BAC Three-Eleven project, intended as a large wide-bodied airliner like the Airbus A300, Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed TriStar. Like the One-Eleven, it would have carried two Rolls-Royce turbofan engines, mounted near the tail. The British national airline BEA wanted to order the type, <b>but</b> <b>government</b> intervention prevented it in favour of the Airbus development. BAC was refused development funds and Hawker Siddeley was awarded the contract to build the Airbus wings.|$|E
25|$|The Board of the Company in Saint Petersburg {{received}} the first {{news of the}} Hawaiian affair {{in the spring of}} 1817 and on March 22 (April 3) instructions were sent to Baranov to dismiss Schäffer as soon as he completed his mission. The board openly distrusted the German and feared the international complications that could hurt the core business. Schäffer's victorious reports of his treaty with Kuamualii were delivered to Saint Petersburg in August, and around the same time European newspapers picked up rumors of Russian expansion in the Pacific. The directors of the Company now considered supporting Schäffer, <b>but</b> <b>government</b> approval depended on the opinion of foreign minister Karl Nesselrode who in turn relied on the opinion of Count von Liven, the ambassador in London.|$|E

25|$|With ocean {{access and}} vast tracts of forest, the South {{is home to}} a good deal of industry. Timber is a {{substantial}} part of the region's economy, and various logging companies have operations in the area. However, because the largest trees within the South itself have mostly been harvested, the region is increasingly being used as a transport network for logging vehicles from Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Congo {{on their way to the}} ports of Kribi and Douala. Kribi is also the site of sawmills, and a palm oil mill operates in Lobé. Ebolowa was in past years an important ivory-working center, <b>but</b> <b>government</b> regulations and the scarcity of elephants in modern times have dampened this part of the economy. Much of the South's electricity is produced in hydroelectric power stations on the Ntem and Ma'an rivers.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrary}} to economic reasons described by India and Pakistan, common fishermen {{of both countries}} get trapped in conflict and their economic rights of earning get affected. It has seen that government of India and Pakistan regularly arrest fishermen of each other for crossing the boundary, however for a common fisherman, {{it is always a}} wonder to know where the boundary starts and ends in sea. This unawareness are added with wind flow, waves and turbulence that push the boat in sea. While UN law advocates for minimum penalty for this offence and release of boats, <b>but</b> <b>government</b> of India and Pakistan catch these prisoners and keep them in prisons for long time. It is more unfortunate that their release happens through land boundary of India and Pakistan (Wagha border) and these poor fishermen come to their home country without their boats.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s jazz {{split into}} two fields. Dance bands like the Elite Swingsters were popular, while avant-garde jazz {{inspired}} {{by the work of}} John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins was also common. The latter field of musicians included prominent activists and thinkers, including Hugh Masekela, Abdullah Ibrahim (formerly known as 'Dollar Brand'), Kippie Moeketsi, Sathima Bea Benjamin, Chris McGregor, Johnny Dyani and Jonas Gwangwa. In 1959, American pianist John Mehegan organised a recording session using many of the most prominent South African jazz musicians, resulting in the first two African jazz LPs. The following year saw the Cold Castle National Jazz Festival, which brought additional attention to South African jazz. Cold Castle became an annual event for a few years, and brought out more musicians, especially Dudu Pukwana, Gideon Nxumalo and Chris McGregor. The 1963 festival produced a LP called Jazz The African Sound, <b>but</b> <b>government</b> oppression soon ended the jazz scene. Again, many musicians emigrated or went into exile in the UK or other countries.|$|E

25|$|There {{were many}} {{concerns}} expressed by local residents and historic preservationists by the successful Trump bid. Preservationists believed Trump would not respect the historic {{nature of the}} building and had almost no experience renovating historic properties <b>but</b> <b>government</b> officials said any redesign would need to be approved by the Commission of Fine Arts (whose secretary signaled heavy scrutiny for any changes). Trump dismissed concerns that he lacked experience with historic buildings, pointing to his redevelopment of Grand Central Terminal in New York City and the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Some city residents worried that Trump would block access to the clock tower. However, the National Park Service said it will retain control over the clock tower and observation deck and it will keep them open for tours. Washington Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein questioned the financial wisdom of selecting Trump/Colony Capital, given Trump's extensive problems with bankruptcy and Colony Capital's current problems keeping its hotel properties out of receivership. Pearlstein and local hoteliers argued that the market would not support the room rates Trump wished to charge, and therefore {{would not be able to}} support the excessive amount of redevelopment money and rent Trump was paying for the property. Robert Peck, Commissioner of the General Services Administration, defended the selection, arguing that the Trump/Colony Capital bid was by far the best in terms of financial commitment, experience in renovating and managing properties, and quality of design. Peck dismissed criticism about Trump's numerous past bankruptcies, noting that these mostly concerned casinos rather than hotels.|$|E

In my head, of course, I knew it was special effects, but I still wasn't prepared for how tactile it was." [...] Filming began June 27, 1997, and lasted for two months. Some shooting was done in Normandy, for the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer and Calvados.
