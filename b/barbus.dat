25|$|The {{fish fauna}} in Lake Kivu is {{relatively}} poor with 28 described species, including four introduced species. The natives are the Lake Rukwa minnow (Raiamas moorii), four species of barb (Ripon barbel, <b>Barbus</b> altianalis, East African red-finned barb, Enteromius. apleurogramma, Redspot barb, Enteromius kerstenii and Pellegrin's barb, Enteromius pellegrini), an Amphilius catfish, two Clarias catfish (C. liocephalus and C. gariepinus), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and 15 endemic Haplochromis cichlids. Another c. 20 possibly undescribed species of cichlids are {{known from the}} lake. The introduced species are three cichlids, the longfin tilapia (Oreochromis macrochir), O. leucostictus and redbreast tilapia (Coptodon rendalli), and a clupeid, the Lake Tanganyika sardine, Limnothrissa miodon.|$|E
25|$|An average 1200 tonnes of {{fish and}} {{crustaceans}} are harvested annually, of which prawns constitute 60%, followed by mullets. Seafood exports of white and tiger prawns, jellyfish, finfish and live lagoon green crabs are also economic benefits from the lagoon. 168 total fish species are reported. The frequently found ones are the mullets: M. cunnesius, M. jerdoni, M. dussumieri, M. cephalus, M. bornensis and blowfish T. nigropunctatus, T. leopardus, <b>Barbus</b> dorsalis, catfish Macrones vittatus, sardines, Sardinella fimbriata and milk fish. Finfish, green crabs, clams and prawns are the most commercially exploited fishes of the lagoon. Endangered green sea turtles are found on the beaches of Sriharikota beach. Apart from prawns, salt is also produced from the lagoon.|$|E
25|$|Some of the animals, which live in Rila, are {{in danger}} as well. 24 of the species that inhabit Rila {{are listed in the}} IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. There are 172 types of {{vertebrates}} living in Rila and 121 of them are registered in the Bulgarian Red List of Threatened Species, 15 are recorded in the European Red List of Threatened Species, 24 are listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature and 158 of 172 are included in the Bern Convention lists. Such animals are <b>Barbus</b> cyclolepis (which is rare because of the habitat loss and the river pollution), Triturus alpestris, Spermophilus citellus (European Ground Squirrel) and others.|$|E
25|$|There are {{concerns}} about the ecological impact of introducing the wels catfish to non-native regions. These concerns {{take into account the}} situation in Lake Victoria in Africa, where Nile perch were introduced and rapidly caused the extinction of numerous indigenous species. This severely impacted the entire lake, destroying much of the original ecosystem. The introduction of foreign species is almost always a burden on the affected ecosystem. Following the introduction of wels catfish, some fishes' numbers are in clear and rapid decline. Since its introduction in the Mequinenza Reservoir in 1974, it has spread {{to other parts of the}} Ebro basin, including its tributaries, especially the Segre River. Some endemic species of Iberian barbels, genus <b>Barbus</b> in the Cyprinidae, were once abundant especially in the Ebro river but due to competition from and predation by wels catfish have since disappeared in the middle channel Ebro. The ecology of the river has also changed, as there is now a major growth in aquatic vegetation such as algae. Barbel species from mountain stream tributaries of the Ebro that wels catfish have not colonized are not affected.|$|E
2500|$|The entirely paraphyletic [...] "Barbinae" [...] and {{the disputed}} Labeoninae {{might be better}} treated {{as part of the}} Cyprininae, forming a close-knit group whose {{internal}} relationships are still little known. The small African [...] "barbs" [...] do not belong in <b>Barbus</b> sensu stricto [...] indeed, they are as distant from the typical barbels and the typical carps (Cyprinus) as these are from Garra (which is placed in the Labeoninae by most who accept the latter as distinct) and thus might form another as yet unnamed subfamily. However, as noted above, how various minor lineages tie into this has not yet been resolved; therefore, such a radical move, though reasonable, is probably premature.|$|E
2500|$|Reptiles and {{amphibians}} {{are only}} an occasionally {{contributor to the}} diet in many regions. Most of the 30 or so species recorded have been taken as supplemental prey in Spain, i.e. several lizards (including geckos), frogs and toads, snakes and, to a lesser degree, turtles. One species widely and commonly reported in Europe outside of the Iberian region is the [...] common frog (Rana temporaria). It was the leading prey, making up 45% of the prey found at nests in Rogaland, Norway. Also, the common frog was the second most abundant prey species in studies from southern Sweden, Valais and Engadin in Switzerland, Verbano-Cusi-Ossola, Italy and an enormous study from Slovakia, in the latter 10,476 frogs recorded making up 28.2% of the prey. There are no records of vicious fights between snakes and Eurasian eagle-owls as there are with the great horned owl, with the horned owl sometimes losing its life after attacking a snake. Perhaps with their larger size and greater power, the eagle-owl can more easily overpower any snakes they encounter, although most snakes in Europe and temperate Asia are not particularly large. Like the golden eagle, the eagle-owl may attack spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca). In Lebanon, a “large adult” tortoise, which {{would be at least}} as heavy as the eagle-owl itself, was among their food items, although how they handle and eat this large, hard-shelled prey is not clear. Eurasian eagle-owls also opportunistically prey on fish, although never in large numbers, as fish are likely to be taken incidentally while hunting for other prey such as water birds. This species is known to take a greater diversity of fish (more than 30 species verified) and is more widely reported to hunt them than the great horned owl. Most of the fish recorded are medium-sized, with at least 10 each of various kinds of carp or cod, but several species averaging more than [...] in mature mass have been taken, including common barbell (<b>Barbus</b> <b>barbus),</b> common carp (Cyprinus carpio), northern pike (Esox lucius) and a few species of trout, even bigger marine predators like the anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) and European conger (Conger conger). However, in many cases small, young specimens may be caught of these large fish species rather than full-grown adults. Several species of insect and invertebrate have been identified in eagle-owl pellets. In some cases, these may be undigested insects in the stomachs of birds eaten by the eagle-owl but Eurasian eagle-owls have been verified as actively hunting insects and aquatic invertebrates such as snails and crabs before. Especially diverse in the diet are ground-based beetles, at least 20 species have been identified mainly those in the Carabus (ground beetle) genus.|$|E
