5|$|King was {{influential}} in deciding who would play Flagg {{in the television}} adaptation of The Stand. He felt {{he was the best}} villain he had ever created, and wanted the actor playing him to <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the part. Director Mick Garris and the studios wanted to give the role to an established star such as Christopher Walken, James Woods, Willem Dafoe or Jeff Goldblum. King himself had suggested Robert Duvall in his introduction to the novel. Miguel Ferrer, who played Flagg's henchman in the film, was interested in playing the villain.|$|E
5|$|The commentaries of Ramayana {{suggest that}} it would <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> Sugriva to marry the widowed Tara. Amritakataka of Kataka Madhava Yogindra says that this was right as they were animals. The Tilaka by Nahesh Bhatt(Ramavarma) justifies Sugriva's {{marriage}} to Tara since Sugriva was her dead husband's brother. It further states that Tara should remarry as she {{did not belong to}} the first three castes and was young. Tara's action of taking Sugriva as her husband after Vali's death is seen as her attempt to secure the futures of Angada and the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Actress Jennifer Ehle {{was chosen}} out {{of half a}} dozen serious {{candidates}} to play Elizabeth, the second Bennet daughter, the brightest girl, and her father's favourite. At the time in her mid-20s, Ehle had first read Pride and Prejudice at the age of 12 and was the only actor to be present throughout the whole filming schedule. Sue Birtwistle particularly wanted Colin Firth, a relatively unknown British actor in his mid-30s at the time, to play the wealthy and aloof Mr. Darcy. Birtwistle had worked with him on the mid-1980s comedy film Dutch Girls, but he repeatedly turned down her offer as he neither felt attracted to Austen's feminine perspective nor believed himself to <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the role. Birtwistle's persistent coaxing and his deeper looks into the Darcy character finally convinced him to accept the role. Firth and Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series, which only received media attention after the couple's separation.|$|E

5|$|Babbit {{recruited}} Clea DuVall, who had {{starred in}} her short film Sleeping Beauties, {{to play the}} role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short Sleeping Beauties and was eager to work with the director. She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster. Babbit briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the All-American character.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} September 2010, {{the actor}} {{acquired}} the rights to Stephen Elliott's The Adderall Diaries, with the intention to adapt, direct, and star in the film. It was announced in January 2011 that the actor has planned to not only star in, but direct himself in The Night Stalker, a film version of author Philip Carlo's book about the 1980s serial killer, Richard Ramirez. Co-screenwriter of the screenplay, Nicholas Constantine, was initially unconvinced that Franco would <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the movie, until he learned of Franco's {{desire to be a}} director and later watched three of his short films, one of which featured a serial killer, ultimately confirming to the writer that the actor had a darker side. The actor also has plans to direct a film version of William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying. Dec. 2010: 286–88 The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. In late 2013 Franco starred in This Is the End as a fictionalized version of himself stuck in a house with Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, and Danny McBride, also fictionalized versions of themselves, when the Apocalypse happens.|$|E

500|$|Barnes played {{carefully}} on the still suspect pitch the following day and {{late in the afternoon}} Bradman, lower in the order than usual due to a leg injury, joined Barnes with the score at 4/159. Over six and a half hours later, Bradman was out for 234. Barnes was dismissed just four balls later, also for 234, having batted for over ten hours. In his autobiography, Barnes stated that the coincidence of scores was intended. [...] "Lots of people have asked me whether I deliberately threw my wicket away at 234. The answer is yes." [...] He confirmed to an interviewer many years later that [...] "it wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> someone to make more runs than Sir Donald Bradman".|$|E
500|$|On 4 November 2012, it was {{announced}} that McGregor would be returning to Neighbours for one month. TV Week's Erin Miller stated, [...] "Fans of Scott's character, Detective Mark Brennan, will be overjoyed to discover he didn't die in witness protection as they'd been led to believe – and his return could potentially see him reunite with ex-girlfriend Kate". Brewer revealed that Mark's return scenes had to be filmed within a week because McGregor was only in Australia for a brief time. The actress explained that they had to film five weeks worth of episodes in one week, before McGregor flew back to Los Angeles. McGregor told a reporter for The Newcastle Herald that he had a feeling {{he was going to be}} asked back eventually, but it still came as a surprise to him.

500|$|Controversy {{emerged on}} the first day of the First Test at Brisbane. After {{compiling}} an uneasy 28 runs, Bradman hit a ball to the gully fieldsman, Jack Ikin. [...] "An appeal for a catch was denied in the umpire's contentious ruling that it was a bump ball". At the end of the over, England captain Wally Hammond spoke with Bradman and criticised him for not [...] "walking"; [...] "from then on the series was a cricketing war just when most people desired peace", Whitington wrote. Bradman regained his finest pre-war form in making 187, followed by 234 during the Second Test at Sydney (Sid Barnes also scored 234 during the innings, many in a still standing 405 run 5th Wicket partnership with Bradman. Barnes later recalled that he purposely got out on 234 because [...] "it wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> someone to make more runs than Bradman"). Australia won both matches by an innings. Jack Fingleton speculated that had the decision at Brisbane gone against him, Bradman would have retired, such were his fitness problems. In the remainder of the series, Bradman made three half-centuries in six innings, but was unable to make another century; nevertheless, his team won handsomely, 3–0. He was the leading batsman on either side, with an average of 97.14. Nearly 850,000 spectators watched the Tests, which helped lift public spirits after the war.|$|E
500|$|Sense and Sensibility {{was shot}} entirely on {{location}} within England, {{mostly in the}} counties of Berkshire, Surrey, Buckinghamshire, and Devon. Filming began in April 2007 and lasted until early June. Blackpool Mill, a fifteenth-century cottage in north Devon, was turned into Barton Cottage, {{the home of the}} Dashwood girls. The art director for the series, James Merifield, had walked past the cottage in 2006 and thought it would be an ideal setting for a film. He was later sent back to the cottage by the location manager for Sense and Sensibility, and he decided the place would <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the production. The owners of Blackpool Mill, Sir Hugh and Lady Stucley, were contacted in February 2007 by the BBC who inquired about the possibility of filming there. Caroline Gammell from The Daily Telegraph reported that [...] "camera crews, production assistants, directors and actors swarmed over Blackpool Mill, turning the rustic four-bedroom home into the romantic hub of Jane Austen's novel. Set designers took the cottage more firmly into the 19th century, adding a porch at the front as well as dormer windows, fake shutters and an extra chimney." [...] The interior of cottage was [...] "a little scruffy" [...] for Mrs Dashwood's status, so scenes featuring the inside of the cottage were filmed in a studio. Filming took place at the cottage over eight days in May.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} few pages of the script, the {{character}} of Sarah Connor is written as [...] "19, small and delicate features. Pretty in a flawed, accessible way. She doesn't stop the party when she walks in, but you'd like {{to get to know}} her. Her vulnerable quality masks a strength even she doesn't know exists." [...] For the role, Cameron chose Linda Hamilton, who had just finished filming Children of the Corn. Rosanna Arquette had previously auditioned. Cameron found a role for Lance Henriksen as Detective Hal Vukovich, as Henriksen had been essential to finding finances for the film. For the special effects shots in the film, Cameron wanted Dick Smith who had previously worked on The Godfather and Taxi Driver. Smith did not take Cameron's offer and suggested his friend Stan Winston for the job. Brad Fiedel was with the Gorfaine/Schwartz Agency where a new agent named Beth Donahue found that Cameron was working on The Terminator and sent him a cassette of Fiedel's music. Fiedel was then invited to a screening of the film with Cameron and Hurd. Hurd was not certain on having Fiedel compose the score as he had only worked in television music previously, and not theatrical films. Fiedel convinced the two that he would <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the job by showing them an experimental piece he had worked on, thinking that [...] "You know, I'm going to play this for him because it’s really dark and I think it’s interesting for him."
