5|$|Hurricane Sandy A similar {{storm in}} 2012 {{with an unusual}} and {{complicated}} track due to <b>baroclinic</b> interactions.|$|E
5|$|In particular, {{the role}} of downdrafts, {{particularly}} the rear-flank downdraft, and {{the role of}} <b>baroclinic</b> boundaries, are intense areas of study.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are classified}} mainly as <b>baroclinic,</b> because they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient known as frontal zones. They can become barotropic late {{in their life}} cycle, when the distribution of heat around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with its radius.|$|E
5|$|In all {{tropical}} basins, {{except the}} Northern Indian Ocean, the extratropical transition of a tropical cyclone {{may result in}} reintensification into a warm seclusion. For example, Hurricane Maria of 2005 reintensified into a strong <b>baroclinic</b> system and achieved warm seclusion status at maturity (or lowest pressure).|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} often {{transform into}} extratropical cyclones {{at the end}} of their tropical existence, usually between 30° and 40° latitude, where there is sufficient forcing from upper-level troughs or shortwaves riding the Westerlies for the process of extratropical transition to begin. During this process, a cyclone in extratropical transition (known across the eastern North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans as the post-tropical stage), will invariably form or connect with nearby fronts and/or troughs consistent with a <b>baroclinic</b> system. Due to this, the size of the system will usually appear to increase, while the core weakens. However, after transition is complete, the storm may re-strengthen due to <b>baroclinic</b> energy, depending on the environmental conditions surrounding the system. The cyclone will also distort in shape, becoming less symmetric with time.|$|E
5|$|During extratropical transition, the cyclone {{begins to}} tilt {{back into the}} colder airmass with height, and the cyclone's primary energy source {{converts}} from the release of latent heat from condensation (from thunderstorms near the center) to <b>baroclinic</b> processes. The low pressure system eventually loses its warm core and becomes a cold-core system.|$|E
5|$|Once {{north of}} Bermuda, Igor began to undergo an extratropical {{transition}} {{as it turned}} northeastward. Though deep convection was no longer consistently over its center, data from Hurricane Hunters continued to support hurricane intensity. Accelerating along {{the leading edge of}} a trough over the Canadian Maritimes, the storm intensified within a <b>baroclinic</b> zone as it neared Newfoundland. The interaction between these two systems allowed the hurricane to strengthen despite moving over decreasing sea surface temperatures. Around 1500UTC on September21, Igor made landfall near Cape Race, with winds of 85mph (140km/h), slightly higher than several hours earlier. Shortly thereafter, the storm completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone, as it became fully embedded within the <b>baroclinic</b> zone. After turning northwestward between Labrador and Greenland, the remnants of Igor were absorbed by another extratropical cyclone on September23, within the Labrador Sea.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{also began}} to merge with a {{low-level}} frontal boundary associated with the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Zita. The strong shear left the center of circulation partially exposed, with deep convection persisting in only the southeastern quadrant. In addition to the shear, dry air began to enter the system, causing it to weaken further. While continuing to move at a quick pace, the storm began to turn towards the southeast along a <b>baroclinic</b> zone. Early on January26, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the cyclone as it lost most of its tropical characteristics. Arthur re-intensified shortly after and the JTWC reissued advisories on the storm around 2100UTC. The brief re-strengthening {{was the result of}} a breakdown in the <b>baroclinic</b> zone which allowed convection to redevelop around the center. Around the same time, Arthur left RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility (AoR) and entered the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre Wellington's AoR. The storm completed its extratropical transition around 1200UTC on January27, leading to the final advisory being issued on the storm.|$|E
5|$|The storm rapidly {{weakened}} as {{it continued}} northward, and degenerated into a tropical depression by July 20. The weak depression moved through Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, maintaining a well-defined cloud signature. Due to a front behind the system, Danny unusually strengthened to {{a tropical storm}} over North Carolina on July 24. This rare phenomenon occurred due to interaction with a developing trough and its associated <b>baroclinic</b> zone.|$|E
5|$|Warm seclusions {{may have}} cloud-free, eye-like {{features}} at their center (reminiscent of tropical cyclones), significant pressure falls, hurricane-force winds, and moderate to strong convection. The most intense warm seclusions often attain pressures less than 950millibars (28.05inHg) with a definitive lower to mid-level warm core structure. A warm seclusion, {{the result of}} a <b>baroclinic</b> lifecycle, occurs at latitudes well poleward of the tropics.|$|E
5|$|Although extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are almost}} always classified as <b>baroclinic</b> since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient within the westerlies, they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius. An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters sufficient to warm its core, {{and as a result}} develops central convection. A particularly intense type of extratropical cyclone that strikes during winter is known colloquially as a nor'easter.|$|E
5|$|Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from {{convective}} clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus). It falls as showers with {{rapidly changing}} intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain {{area for a}} relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, {{it has been suggested}} that stratiform precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with <b>baroclinic</b> boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.|$|E
5|$|Cyclogenesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called <b>baroclinic</b> zones. These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided {{over the course of}} its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream.|$|E
5|$|During its {{weakening}} stage, deep convection {{existed only}} in the northwestern quadrant of the circulation. On August 19, cold cloud tops reappeared, although this brief revival {{has been attributed to}} non-tropical <b>baroclinic</b> instability. At 1200 UTC, the depression was declared extratropical, and it continued northward until dissipating near California a day later. Moisture from the system persisted as it passed through the state and the Pacific Northwest, ultimately merging with a larger extratropical cyclone involving the remnants of Hurricane Guillermo.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 24, Karl {{continued}} its north-northeast track over the open north-central Atlantic {{and continued to}} gradually weaken. It started to {{come in contact with}} the <b>baroclinic</b> zone and began to lose tropical characteristics, while still a Category1 hurricane. Karl became extratropical shortly afterward over the northern Atlantic at about 47°N, with its winds dropping below hurricane strength shortly thereafter. The extratropical storm made landfall on the Faroe Islands with hurricane-force wind gusts. As an extratropical low, the cyclone moved northeastward and eastward across the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, eventually reaching Norway before it was absorbed into another extratropical low late on September 28.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Emily {{continued}} tracking northeast throughout September25 {{into the}} following day with increasing speed. By late on September25, the forward motion of the storm had reached 50mph (85km/h). The storm now began to undergo an extratropical transition with forward speed peaking at 65mph (100km/h), the third highest forward motion ever recorded in a tropical cyclone. Interacting with a <b>baroclinic</b> zone, the hurricane completed its transition at 1800UTC on September26, resulting in the issuance of the final advisory on the storm.|$|E
5|$|Typically, {{tropical}} cyclones do {{not form}} in the South Atlantic Ocean, due to strong upper level shear, cool water temperatures, {{and the lack of}} a convergence zone of convection. Occasionally though, as seen in 1991 and early 2004, conditions can become slightly more favorable. For Catarina, {{it was a combination of}} climatic and atmospheric anomalies. Water temperatures on Catarina's path ranged from 24 to 25°C, slightly less than the 26.5°C temperature of a normal tropical cyclone, but sufficient for a storm of <b>baroclinic</b> origin.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} extratropical, Charley re-intensified under <b>baroclinic</b> instability. The resulting {{storm was}} a very large and fairly strong gale that gradually moved across the northern Atlantic Ocean. As an extratropical cyclone, Charley attained an atmospheric pressure of 980 mbar, which was lower than its pressure as a tropical cyclone. On August 24, it spawned a separate extratropical cyclone, which initially moved northeastward before turning and dissipating near Spain. The remnants of Charley accelerated as it approached the British Isles, and after passing south of Ireland it moved across Great Britain on August 27. While in the North Sea, the cyclone weakened as it executed a counter-clockwise loop, and on August 30 the remnants of Charley dissipated near Denmark as a new circulation developed to its southwest.|$|E
5|$|Early on September2, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} again and was downgraded to a Category1 hurricane. At 0600UTC on September3, Danielle reached its minimum barometric pressure of 960mb (hPa; 28.35inHg), although sustained winds were only 80mph (130km/h) at the time. As late as 1500UTC on September3, satellite imagery indicated that Danielle was retaining tropical characteristics. The National Hurricane Center did not forecast any further weakening before the extratropical transition, but instead mentioned {{the possibility of}} <b>baroclinic</b> strengthening. Late on September3, the final advisory was issued on the transitioning storm. Danielle officially transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 0000UTC on September4 according to a post-season report from the NHC, while located east-southeast of Newfoundland. The remnants of Danielle traversed east and eventually northeastward across the Atlantic Ocean. It produced rough seas in the British Isles on September6 before merging with an extratropical low pressure area north of Ireland on September8.|$|E
5|$|Late on January 1, 2009, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{reported}} that {{an area of}} deep atmospheric convection had persisted for the last 48hours about 730km (455mi), to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. Deep convection was developing over the northern quadrant of a weak low level circulation center. A subtropical ridge of pressure was helping to guide the disturbance and was providing good outflow as well as low to moderate vertical wind shear. However, as the disturbance was moving into {{a higher level of}} vertical wind shear the depression was not expected to develop into a significant tropical cyclone within 48 hours. During the next 48 hours the disturbance gradually developed, with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) reporting early on January 3 that it had become the first tropical depression of the season, with the name Auring being assigned to the depression by PAGASA whilst it was located about 140km (85mi) east of Surigao City on the Philippine island of Mindanao. This came after the low level circulation center had started to consolidate as deep convection was being fueled by a poleward diffluence despite being in an area of strong vertical wind shear. Over {{the next couple of days}} as Auring moved towards the east, dry air started to wrap in to its low level circulation center which started to weaken the depression after it had peaked with winds of 45km/h, (30mph) 10-min sustained and a peak pressure of 1006 hPa/Mbar. As the <b>baroclinic</b> zone approached the depression late on January 5, PAGASA downgraded the depression to an area of low pressure as the <b>baroclinic</b> zone was approaching the depression, as vertical wind shear had increased and outflow became hindered. However the JMA continued to issue warnings on the depression until early the next morning when the depression was declared dissipated by the JTWC and the JMA.|$|E
5|$|The JTWC issued {{advisories}} on Faxai, designating it as 20W; {{however, they}} classified it as a tropical depression. Several hours later, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition, with convection persisting {{mainly in the}} northwestern portion of the storm and cold, dry air entering into the southwestern portion. At 1200UTC, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Tropical Storm Juaning as it moved out of their area of responsibility. The JTWC reported that Tropical Depression 20W (Faxai) had become extratropical around this time as it merged with a <b>baroclinic</b> zone. A cold front developed along the southern portion of Faxai, a feature of extratropical cyclones. Around that time, the JMA upgraded Faxai to a severe tropical storm with winds of 95km/h (60mph 10-minute sustained).|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of tropical cyclones in the Mediterranean Sea can usually only occur under somewhat unusual circumstances. Low wind shear and atmospheric instability induced by incursions {{of cold air}} are often required. A majority of medicanes are also accompanied by upper-level troughs, providing energy required for intensifying atmospheric convection—thunderstorms—and heavy precipitation. The <b>baroclinic</b> properties of the Mediterranean region, with high temperature gradients, also provides necessary instability {{for the formation of}} tropical cyclones. Another factor, rising cool air, provides necessary moisture as well. Warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are mostly unnecessary, however, as most medicanes' energy is derived from warmer air temperatures. When these favorable circumstances coincide, the genesis of warm-core Mediterranean tropical cyclones, often from within existing cut-off cold-core lows, is possible in a conducive environment for formation.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Auring {{formed as}} a {{tropical}} disturbance late on December 30, 2008, to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. Over {{the next few days}} the disturbance gradually developed before early on January 3, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), reported that the disturbance had intensified into the first tropical depression of the season with PAGASA assigning the name Auring to the depression. As the Depression was moving into a high level of vertical wind shear, it did not develop any further and late on January 5 as the <b>baroclinic</b> zone approached Auring, it was downgraded to an area of low pressure by PAGASA before the JMA followed suit the next day as it was declared as dissipated by the JTWC.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Klaus {{was located in}} an area of 29mph (47km/h) of wind shear, although concurrently it was located over warm water temperatures of 83.1°F (28.4°C). Tracking through a highly <b>baroclinic</b> environment, the storm became better organized, and at 1200UTC on October 5 Klaus attained hurricane status about 30miles (50km) east of Antigua; shortly thereafter, it passed 12miles (19km) east of Barbuda, its closest point of approach to the Lesser Antilles. Klaus reached peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum central pressure of , though most of its deep convection and strong winds remained to its northeast due to wind shear. At the time the hurricane was forecast to continue tracking to the north-northwest. However, after weakening to a tropical storm on October 6, Klaus turned westward.|$|E
5|$|During February 1, as Cyclone Gene {{was moving}} to the west, Gene {{recurved}} and started moving towards the south and missed Vanuatu. The next day cyclone Gene started to temporarily weaken again by becoming a category two cyclone with winds speeds of 95km/h (60mph 10 min). This came as cyclone Gene approached 25°S which marks the edge of RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility, {{to the south of}} 25°S the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand, monitors tropical cyclones, south of 25°S. As Gene crossed in to TCWC Wellington's area of responsibility, Cyclone Gene started to re-intensify becoming a severe tropical cyclone again with peak winds of 120km/h (105mph 10 min) however this re-intensification only lasted for 12 hours before Gene began to weaken for the final time by becoming a tropical cyclone that day. Gene slowly weakened {{over the next couple of}} days as it moved towards the south east. The JTWC then issued its final warning on February 6 as Cyclone Gene was finishing its extratropical transition, and had also become fully embedded within the <b>baroclinic</b> zone. TCWC Wellington continued to monitor the extratropical remnants of Gene until February 9, after the sustained windspeeds had dropped to below 65km/h (40mph).|$|E
5|$|Factors {{required}} {{for the formation of}} medicanes are somewhat different than that normally expected of tropical cyclones; known to emerge over regions with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) below , Mediterranean tropical cyclones often require incursions of colder air to induce atmospheric instability. A majority of medicanes develop above regions of the Mediterranean with SSTs of , with the upper bound only found in the southernmost reaches of the sea. Despite the low sea surface temperatures, the instability incited by cold atmospheric air within a <b>baroclinic</b> zone—regions with high differences in temperature and pressure—permits the formation of medicanes, in contrast to tropical areas lacking high baroclinity, where raised SSTs are needed. While significant deviations in air temperature have been noted around the time of Mediterranean tropical cyclones' formation, few anomalies in sea surface temperature coincide with their development, indicating that the formation of medicanes is primarily controlled by higher air temperatures, not by anomalous SSTs. Similar to tropical cyclones, minimal wind shear—difference in wind speed and direction over a region—as well as abundant moisture and vorticity encourages the genesis of tropical cyclone-like systems in the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|On September3, another trough {{exited the}} coast of the United States, {{allowing}} the hurricane to accelerate toward the northeast through the diminished ridge. By that time, the winds had decreased to 80mph (130km/h), although forecasters expected <b>baroclinic</b> instability to maintain much of the cyclone's remaining force. Instead of continued weakening, the hurricane began to significantly re-intensify. Early on September4, Ella again reached major hurricane status, and later that day it peaked with winds of 140mph (220km/h); {{at the time it was}} about 335miles (540km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and its peak winds were measured by Hurricane Hunters. This made it the strongest hurricane ever recorded in Canadian waters. Weakening began immediately after peak intensity due to cooler water temperatures. Early on September5, Ella passed very near Cape Race, although the strongest winds were south and east of the center. Associated convection became completely removed from the center, and the hurricane became extratropical as it was absorbed by a larger mid-latitude system.|$|E
5|$|Several {{hours later}} on August8, the JTWC also {{declared}} the system a tropical depression, classifying it at 10W. Later that day, convection {{associated with the}} depression became disorganized, preventing intensification of the system. The depression generally tracked towards the northwest during the day in response a subtropical ridge to the north. By August9, the center of circulation became more defined as convection wrapped around it. Around 1200UTC, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Etau. The JTWC, however, did not upgrade the system to a tropical storm for several more hours. On August10, the JTWC briefly downgraded the storm to a tropical depression. By this time, the system had re-curved to the east around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge. Etau also became slightly disorganized as it began {{to interact with the}} <b>baroclinic</b> zone near Japan. Early on August11, the JMA reported that the storm winds had peaked at 75km/h (45mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 992hPa (mbar). Later that day, the storm once more became slightly disorganized due to increased wind shear; however, the JTWC reported that the storm intensified based on satellite intensity estimates and weather radar imagery from Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{strengthening}} was {{the result}} of Conson passing over the warm waters of the Kuroshio Current. The forward motion on the typhoon also began to increase as it interacted with a <b>baroclinic</b> zone. Shortly after, the JMA assessed the storm to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 150km/h (90mph 10-minute winds) and a minimum pressure of 960hPa (mbar). Later that day, the storm passed over Okinawa as it weakened. By June10, Conson began to undergo an extratropical transition. Continuing increase in forward speed caused the low to become exposed from shower and thunderstorm activity on the southern edge of the circulation. Around 1200UTC, the center of circulation became separated from deep convection, leading to the typhoon being downgraded to a tropical storm by both agencies several hours later. Early on June11, the JTWC reported that the storm had completed its extratropical transition just south of Japan. However, the JMA kept Conson has a tropical cyclone through its landfall in Kōchi Prefecture as a minimal tropical storm. Shortly after landfall, it was classified as an extratropical cyclone. Continuing towards the northeast, the storm remained weak and was last mentioned as it crossed the international date line on June14 near the Aleutian Islands.|$|E
5|$|While {{continuing}} {{generally to}} the west, {{the eye of}} Pongsona gradually became better organized. A <b>baroclinic</b> cyclone east of Japan weakened the ridge, which caused the typhoon to turn more to the northwest. By late on December 7, Pongsona developed a well-defined 55km (35mi) wide eye as it approached Guam. After the typhoon underwent rapid deepening, the JTWC estimated that Pongsona reached peak winds of 240km/h (150mph 1-min sustained), making it a supertyphoon. At 0500UTC on December 8, the eyewall made landfall on Guam, and two hours later the northern portion of the eyewall crossed over nearby Rota. Around that time, the JMA estimated Pongsona attained a peak intensity of 175km/h (110mph 10-min winds) just {{to the north of}} Guam. The typhoon turned to the north-northwest through a weakness in the subtropical ridge a short distance west of the Northern Mariana Islands. On December 9, convection began to weaken as Pongsona began interacting with a mid-latitude system to its north. Dry air became entrained in the southwestern portion of the circulation, and the circulation became exposed from the diminishing convection. As a result, both the JTWC and the JMA declared Pongsona as an extratropical cyclone on December 11 about 1400km (865mi) northwest of Wake Island.|$|E
5|$|As the cyclone {{reached the}} western {{periphery}} of the ridge that steered it across the Atlantic for much of its existence, it began yet another period of intensification, and once again attained a peak intensity as a Category2 hurricane. Passing northwest of Bermuda, Danielle weakened to Category1 hurricane strength, but for a final time intensified into a 105mph (165km/h) tropical cyclone thereafter. As the cyclone passed over increasingly cool sea surface temperatures and became intertwined in a <b>baroclinic</b> zone, it began to undergo an extratropical transition. At 0000UTC on September4, Danielle was no longer considered a tropical cyclone, despite retaining hurricane-force winds. Several days later, the remnants of Danielle merged with a larger extratropical low and became indistinguishable. As a tropical cyclone, it produced heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, leading to flooding. Tropical storm-force winds were observed in Bermuda even though the cyclone passed well northwest of the island. During Danielle's transition to an extratropical cyclone, it produced light rain and led to minor beach erosion in Newfoundland. The larger extratropical low that merged with the system resulted in large waves {{off the coast of}} the United Kingdom, leading to major beach erosion and coastal flooding. Overall, no fatalities were reported with the system and it caused an estimated $50,000 (1998 USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} moved northward over the Yellow Sea, {{atmospheric}} conditions became increasingly hostile, with significantly lower sea surface temperatures and high wind shear. During the overnight of August2728, the typhoon brushed South Korea as a weakening cyclone. Convection {{on the west}} side of the storm diminished and its feeder bands began to collapse. Increasing shear started taking its toll early on August28 as convection became displaced from the center of circulation, leaving part of the southwestern quadrant exposed. This also indicated that Bolaven had begun to undergo an extratropical transition as it approached the Korean Peninsula. Following structural weakening, the JMA and JTWC downgraded Bolaven to a severe tropical storm and tropical storm, respectively. Hours before moving onshore in North Korea, the majority of the convection had moved over land while the circulation and the center itself had only stratocumulus clouds covering it. Around 1500UTC on August28, Bolaven made landfall in North Korea with winds of 100km/h (65mph). Rapidly moving towards the northeast, the storm became fully embedded within a <b>baroclinic</b> zone near the ChinaNorth Korea border later that day. The JMA continued to monitor Bolaven as a tropical cyclone until early on August29, at which time the system was situated over the southern region of the Russian Far East. The extratropical remnants later turned eastward and were last noted on September1 crossing the International Dateline.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form along linear {{bands of}} temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear, {{and are thus}} classified as <b>baroclinic</b> cyclones. Initially, cyclogenesis, or low pressure formation, occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak. The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants, where divergence ensues. The divergence causes air to rush out {{from the top of}} the air column. As mass in the column is reduced, atmospheric pressure at surface level (the weight of the air column) is reduced. The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone (a low pressure system). The lowered pressure acts to draw in air, creating convergence in the low-level wind field. Low-level convergence and upper-level divergence imply upward motion within the column, making cyclones tend to be cloudy. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves around the back of the cyclone. Meanwhile, its associated warm front progresses more slowly, as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser, and therefore more difficult to dislodge. Later, the cyclones occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front, forcing a tongue, or trowal, of warm air aloft. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters {{originally}} believed Fay to {{have only}} briefly been a hurricane, but post-season reanalysis revealed that the system had actually strengthened into a Category1 hurricane by early on October12 and maintained that strength for 12 hours. The upgrade was confirmed by buoy and land observations and weather radar data. At 08:10UTC, the cyclone made landfall on Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h), the hurricane's peak intensity. Fay was the first hurricane to make landfall on the island since Emily in 1987. Its satellite presentation improved as a mid-level eye feature formed, though the system remained lopsided. Fay then accelerated toward the east-northeast ahead of a shortwave trough to the north, which also acted to further enhance shear in the area. The hurricane finally succumbed to the persistent wind shear when the low-level center decoupled from the mid-level low and became elongated. By {{the early morning hours}} of October13, Fay started transitioning into an extratropical cyclone as it entered a <b>baroclinic</b> environment and ingested colder, drier air. The circulation rapidly deteriorated; consequently, the NHC issued its last operational advisory on the system at 21:00UTC on October12. Early the following day, the storm degenerated into an open trough, ending its existence as a tropical cyclone. Shortly after, the system became reestablished as a frontal cyclone, which lost its definition over the northeastern Atlantic on October 15.|$|E
5|$|Now a {{tropical}} depression, Gilda remained nearly stationary for another 24 hours before accelerating northeastward, {{under the influence}} of an upper-level trough exiting the east coast of the United States. Cold air from the trough interacted with Gilda, providing a <b>baroclinic</b> environment for intensifying, and on October 24 the storm transitioned into a subtropical storm about halfway between Hispaniola and North Carolina. This made Gilda the first tropical storm on record to transition into a subtropical cyclone. Operationally, tropical storm advisories were still issued on Gilda while it was subtropical, due to the need to maintain consistency and the possibility it could again become tropical. The circulation of the storm became very large, at one point stretching from New England to the Bahamas, and eastward beyond Bermuda, or a diameter of more than 1300 mi (2100 km). On October 25, Gilda passed about halfway between Bermuda and Cape Hatteras, when it reached peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). Subsequently it turned northeastward, and on October 27 attained a minimum pressure of 984 mbar, the lowest of its duration while tropical or subtropical. Later that day, Gilda became an extratropical cyclone southeast of the Canadian Maritimes as it moved over colder waters. After passing just southeast of Newfoundland, the storm continued northeastward, becoming nearly stationary off the coast of Greenland before dissipating on October 30.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>baroclinic</b> atmosphere, where {{density is}} a {{function}} of both pressure and temperature, such horizontal temperature gradients can exist. The difference in horizontal wind speed with height that results is a vertical wind shear, traditionally called the thermal wind.|$|E
