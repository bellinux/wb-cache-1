5|$|In roughly 1 out {{of every}} 100200people, the right {{inferior}} laryngeal nerve is nonrecurrent, branching off the vagus nerve around {{the level of the}} cricoid cartilage. Typically, such a configuration is accompanied by variation in the arrangement of the major arteries in the chest; most commonly, the right subclavian artery arises from {{the left side of the}} aorta and crosses behind the esophagus. A left nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve is even more uncommon, requiring the aortic arch <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> side, accompanied by an arterial variant which prevents the nerve from being drawn into the chest by the left subclavian.|$|E
5|$|When {{the flag}} is {{displayed}} on a platform or stage, it must be above all decorations and be behind and above any person speaking from the platform or stage. If it is displayed from a staff standing on the platform or stage, it must <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> side of the person speaking from the platform or stage. Finally, when the flag is hung, it must be hung against a vertical wall or other vertical flat surface, with the crescent and stars on the top left position as seen by any spectator facing the flag and the wall or surface.|$|E
5|$|Whenever {{the flag}} is {{displayed}} indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it should always <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> (observers' left), {{as this is}} the position of authority. So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting place, it must {{be placed on the}} speaker's right hand. When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be {{to the right of the}} audience. The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on top. If hung vertically on the wall behind the podium, the saffron stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top.|$|E

The laundresses paid the owners a fee {{for the use of}} the boat. There were some eighty of them in 1714; groups of six, moored two by two, were anchored across from Notre Dame, near the Pont Saint-Michel, and near the rue de l'Hôtel-Colbert. They preferred to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> bank, so the sunshine could dry the laundry.|$|E
25|$|Clegg was {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of the Liberal Party and {{was associated with the}} Liberal League. He was opposed to socialism and was hostile to the Labour Party. From 1909, he began co-operating closely with the Conservative Party group on the council, and in 1920 the two parties formed the Citizens' Association, Clegg being its first leader. He pursued low-tax policies at the expense of cutting services and running up debts. He was an opponent of David Lloyd George's policies. The Association lost control of the council to Labour in 1926, who removed him from the aldermanic bench.|$|E

25|$|Dave Wrobel {{has taught}} {{construction}} and carpentry at Mohawk College {{and worked as}} an accident benefits claims representative. Considered to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> wing of the political spectrum, {{he was a member}} of the Reform Party of Canada and the Canadian Alliance before winning election himself. He first ran for Brantford City Council in the 1997 municipal election; thirty-one years old during the campaign, he finished a relatively close third. He was elected in his second attempt in 2000; in this campaign, he called for Brantford casino revenues to be put in a reserve to reduce taxes and opposed using public funds to save private buildings. After the election, he emerged as a frequent opponent of Mayor Chris Friel and a regular ally of his ward-mate Richard Carpenter. In 2002, he offered support to Marguerite Ceschi-Smith's campaign for reclaiming brownfield sites. Wrobel supported Progressive Conservative candidate Alayne Sokoloski in the 2003 provincial election. He was himself re-elected in the 2003 municipal election. Wrobel was given a leave of absence for health reasons in early 2005. He joined with Carpenter and Ceschi-Smith in November 2005, refusing to attend a closed-door session on boundary adjustments and ethanol production; he said the issues were too important to be dealt with in private. He resigned his seat in February 2006 following continued health issues. With his health situation improved, he was re-elected to council in 2010.|$|E
25|$|When {{the group}} of flags of the European Union are flown, the {{sequence}} is alphabetical, based on the first letter of the country's name. The flags should be flown {{from left to right}} with the European Union flag flown from the first flagstaff before the group. An alternative order of flags is to begin on the left with the national flag and place the European Union flag on the far right of the group, as seen by an observer. With regard to international flags; where either an even or an odd number of flags are flown in line on staffs of equal height, the national flag should be first on the right of the line— that is on the observer's left as he or she faces the flags. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be flown on the immediate left of the national flag, or as seen by an observer, on the immediate right of the national flag. Where, however, an odd number of flags are displayed from staffs grouped so that there is one staff in the centre and higher than the others, the national flag should be displayed from the staff so placed. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be flown from the first flagstaff on the right, or as seen by an observer, on the first flagstaff on the left. Only one national flag should be displayed in each group of flags or at each location. In all cases, the national flag should be in the place of honour. When the national flag is displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall or other background, the green should <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> (an observer's left) in the horizontal position or uppermost in the vertical position. When displayed on a platform, the national flag should be above and behind the speaker's desk. While being carried, the flag should not be dipped by way of salute or compliment except to the dead during memorial ceremonies.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} David Robert Jones is {{a reference}} to English musician David Bowie, who was born with that name. [...] "In Which We Meet Mr. Jones" [...] was the first appearance of the character. When actor Jared Harris was first cast for the part, he was told Jones was [...] "possibly a major, important character", {{as indicated by the}} episode's title. Whether his character would make a reappearance later in the season depended on how well received Jones was by the show's audience, Harris' performance, and if the writers felt they had more to tell about the character. [...] Harris later described Jones in a May 2009 interview, [...] "I think you could sense that there was a great bit of ambiguity about the character which was useful. He's a bad guy that might <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> side. He just might be fighting for the good guys. Those guys are always great parts because you leave the audience guessing about what side he's really on. He's one of those guys that if he's fighting for the right cause, he's a tremendous ally. But if he's fighting on the wrong cause, he's a formidable opponent. He's an anti-hero who is fighting for the just cause". Harris asserted in a February 2009 interview that he did not sign a recurring contract, meaning that the character was not meant to be permanent. He affirmed this by believing the character's personality rendered Jones incapable of joining the regular cast, [...] "You'd have to keep [...] chained like a dog. You couldn't let him loose. You certainly couldn't let him use his hands. You know what the f--k he'd do".|$|E

2500|$|In publishing, [...] "recto" [...] and [...] "verso" [...] {{are used}} for {{the front and back}} of pages in books, {{especially}} manuscripts, meaning the first side of a leaf encountered by a reader, which will <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of an opening for Western manuscripts, but on the left of an opening for those in many Asian and Middle Eastern languages such as Chinese and Arabic.

[...] This will <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> hand side of the opening of any book composed in a script that is read from left-to-right, such as Latin (as used in English), Cyrillic, or Greek, and will be opposite for books composed in a script that is read from right-to-left, such as Hebrew and Arabic.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the plug}} is polarised, CEE7 does not define the {{placement}} of the line and neutral and there is no universally-observed standard.

However, the socket may not necessarily be installed with the earth pin at the top. Packaging in France of sockets is normally marked with correct connection of the cables.

An offensive in the north through Belgium and the Netherlands would lead to an invasion of France and a decisive victory. Even with the windfall of the Russian defeat in the Far East and belief in the superiority of German military thinking, Schlieffen had reservations about the strategy and research published by Ritter (1956, English edition in 1958) showed that the memorandum went through six drafts. Schlieffen considered other possibilities in 1905, using war games to model a Russian invasion of east Germany, against a smaller German army.|$|E
2500|$|Ted Morton {{was first}} elected to the Alberta {{legislature}} in the Alberta general election, 2004.

[...] Morton served a six-year term as a [...] "senator in waiting" [...] between 1998 and 2004 after he was elected by Albertans in the Alberta Senate nominee election, 1998 and used this position to advocate for democratic reform. [...] Although Ted Morton was a backbencher, he was considered a strong contender for the leadership because of his high profile in the former Reform Party and Canadian Alliance. Morton was considered to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of the political spectrum, and supported allowing people to pay for non-emergency health care services such as hip and knee replacements. Ted Morton also presented a private members bill in the Alberta legislature which would have allowed marriage commissioners who objected to same-sex marriage to opt out of performing same-sex marriages. Morton became one of two Senators-in-Waiting chosen by Albertans in a 1998 election.|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly noted [...] "As on his first two efforts, he spends L.A.X. barking gleefully ignorant gangsta fantasies over hard-knocking drums. And while the 19-track disc could use a good trimming, The Game's routine is just as entertaining the third time around." [...] The Guardians Angus Batey stated [...] "LAX is an intense and remarkably focused record - almost every syllable concerns Compton, gangsta rap and (as one song title has it)." [...] Pitchfork Media stated that [...] "Relatively, he's won Round 3 by making his third straight album that's better than it has any right to be-- {{but the fact that the}} Game can make perfectly uncompelling competence sound like victory is proof that he's a master thespian of hip-hop theater." [...] Jordan Sargent of PopMatters complimented The Game stating that [...] "On LAX, Game hasn’t changed, but he’s picked a group of beats that get him closer to extricating himself from both his West Coast Messiah complex and the post-G-Unit narrative.
