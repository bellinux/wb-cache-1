2500|$|Gratin (...) is a {{widespread}} culinary technique in which an ingredient is topped with a browned crust, often using breadcrumbs, grated cheese, egg and/or butter. Gratin originated in French cuisine and is usually prepared {{in a shallow dish}} of some kind. A gratin is baked or cooked under an overhead grill or broiler to form a golden crust on top and is traditionally served in its <b>baking</b> <b>dish.</b>|$|E
2500|$|To make pommes de terre gratinées, or [...] "potatoes with cheese", {{according}} to the recipe of Marcel Boulestin, large floury potatoes are baked in the oven, then halved and the flesh scooped from the skins. The flesh is then mashed together with butter, cream, grated cheese and seasoning(s). The mix is then scooped back into the skins, arranged in a <b>baking</b> <b>dish,</b> sprinkled with grated cheese and browned in the oven or under the grill. This preparation is also called twice-baked potatoes.|$|E
2500|$|Salkuuyaq or Sal'kuuyaq (Yup'ik), Cal'kuuyaq (Cup'ik) (also, {{casserole}} of meat or {{fish with}} potatoes, onions, etc.) is fresh fish baked whole or filleted after the entrails are removed. The meat of fish baked whole is slit {{in the middle}} lengthwise on the other side. Fish are placed in a <b>baking</b> <b>dish,</b> seasoned, oiled, and baked. Younger people seem to prefer this over the plainer boiled fish. It is often eaten with boiled rice. It is derived from Russian [...] (zharkóe) ‘roast’.|$|E

50|$|Patinas {{can also}} be found in woks or other metal <b>baking</b> <b>dishes,</b> which form when {{properly}} seasoned. The patina on a wok is a dark coating of oils that have been burned onto it to prevent food sticking and to enhance the flavor of the foods cooked in it. Steaming foods or using soap on a wok or other dishware could damage the patina and possibly allow rust.|$|R

5000|$|In {{place of}} a pastry casing {{enclosing}} the pie, a topping of mashed potatoes (sometimes with cheese or vegetables such as onions and leeks added) is used to cover the fish during <b>baking.</b> The <b>dish</b> is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "fisherman's pie" [...] because the topping {{is similar to that of}} shepherd's pie, in that it uses mashed potatoes.|$|R
5000|$|Most bare {{cast-iron}} {{pots and}} pans are cast as {{a single piece of}} metal, including the handle. This allows them to be used on both the stovetop and in the oven. Many recipes call for the use of a cast-iron skillet or pot, especially so that the dish can be initially seared or fried on the stovetop then transferred into the oven, pan and all, to finish baking. Likewise, cast-iron skillets can double as <b>baking</b> <b>dishes.</b> Cornbread in particular is seen as a food item that is best prepared in a cast-iron skillet: the iron pan is heated beforehand in the oven, the ingredients are first combined and mixed in a mixing bowl, then added to the heated pan, and the dish is then placed directly into the oven for fast baking. This differs from many other cooking pots, which have varying components that may be damaged by the excessive temperatures of [...] or more.|$|R

50|$|A hotdish is a {{casserole}} which typically contains a starch, a meat, and a canned or frozen vegetable mixed with canned soup. The dish originates from the Upper Midwest {{region of the}} United States, where it remains popular, particularly in Minnesota and North Dakota. Hotdish is cooked in a single <b>baking</b> <b>dish,</b> and served hot (per its name). It commonly appears at communal gatherings such as family reunions, potlucks and church suppers.|$|E
50|$|The baked {{dumpling}} {{is popular}} in American cuisine. These sweet dumplings {{are made by}} wrapping fruit, frequently a whole tart apple, in pastry, then baking until the pastry is browned and the filling is tender. As an alternative to simply baking them, these dumplings are surrounded by a sweet sauce in the <b>baking</b> <b>dish,</b> and may be basted during cooking. Popular flavours for apple dumplings include brown sugar, caramel, or cinnamon sauces.|$|E
5|$|Cooking in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} frying, simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and frying. The only form of cooking that was slow to develop was <b>baking.</b> Typical <b>dishes</b> among the upper classes were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and sometimes {{a good amount of}} claret. Common food among the lower classes was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.|$|R
60|$|However, we lads {{have not}} had good success in <b>baking</b> this last <b>dish,</b> because of the ashes which fly out of the fire when the wind blows ever so slightly. Captain Smith {{declares}} that he would rather have the ashes without the meal and sweet potato, if indeed he must eat any, but of course when he speaks thus, {{it is only in}} the way of making sport.|$|R
50|$|Stuffed {{mushrooms}} are typically {{placed on a}} cooking pan or dish and baked or broiled to cook the dish. They can also be cooked on skewers, and can be cooked on a rotisserie. The mushrooms shrink during the <b>baking</b> process. The <b>dish</b> is typically served hot or at room temperature, and can also be served cold. The dish can be served as an hors d'oeuvre, as a side dish, and as a snack.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally in Bulgaria {{the filling}} {{is made of}} rice steamed in advance, onions, minced meat and spices, {{heat-treated}} and crammed into pre-cleaned, washed and riddled with needle peppers. After filling of peppers, they are put in a <b>baking</b> <b>dish,</b> water is added and the dish is baked in the oven.

50|$|A {{slightly}} different variety, cooked {{in a simple}} <b>baking</b> <b>dish,</b> is associated with northern U.S. cuisine; {{it tends to be}} sweeter and lighter than southern-style cornbread; the batter for northern-style cornbread is very similar to and sometimes interchangeable with that of a corn muffin. A typical contemporary northern U.S. cornbread recipe contains half wheat flour, half cornmeal, milk or buttermilk, eggs, leavening agent, salt, and usually sugar, resulting in a bread that is somewhat lighter and sweeter than the traditional southern version.|$|E
50|$|Eve's pudding, {{also known}} as Mother Eve's pudding, {{is a type of}} {{traditional}} British pudding now made from apples and Victoria sponge cake mixture. The apples are allowed to stew {{at the bottom of the}} <b>baking</b> <b>dish</b> while the cake mixture cooks on top. The name is a reference to the biblical Eve. It is a simplified version of Duke of Cumberland's pudding. The earliest known version dates from 1824, predating baking powder, and therefore uses grated bread and shredded suet.|$|E
40|$|To perform real-word {{information}} processing, such as intelligent robotics, {{multimodal dialogue}} system and video processing, {{it is essential}} to integrate several media processing technique such as natural language processing, speech recognition and image analysis. From the viewpoint of natural language processing, since language in the real world is strongly depends on the scene, {{it is important to understand}} utterances in accordance with the scene. This thesis focuses on handling video contents. Among several types of videos, in which instruction videos (how-to videos) about sports, cooking, D. I. Y., and others are the most valuable, we focus on cooking TV programs. In realizing flexible utilization/access of video contents, the crucial point is the structural understanding of their contents, which requires the interpretation of utterances based on wider contexts including the scene. Chapter 2 describes basic linguistic analysis of cooking instruction utterances (closed caption texts). First, we perform anaphora resolution, which is inevitable to detect the discourse structure or correspond linguistic information to visual information. We build an anaphora resolution system based on the large-scale case frame. Next, we detect utterance-type of a clause of each utterance. In cooking instruction utterances, while explanations of actions are dominant, there are several types of utterances such as declaration of beginning of series of actions, tips of actions, notes, etc. We classify cooking instruction utterance and recognize utterance-type by clause-end patterns. Then, we analyze the discourse structure of instruction utterances. This analysis is performed by integrating the anaphora resolution result, utterance-type and generic discourse structure rules, which consider cue phrases and word chaining. Chapter 3 proposes an unsupervised topic identification method integrating linguistic and visual information based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Identified topics lead to video segmentation/summarization and are used for automatically acquiring the object models described in Chapter 4. We employ HMMs for topic identification, wherein a state corresponds to a topic and various features including linguistic, visual and audio information are observed. This study considers a clause as an unit of analysis and the following eight topics as a set of states: preparation, sauteing, frying, <b>baking,</b> simmering, boiling, <b>dishing</b> up, steaming. The basic linguistic feature is a case frame, which is a generalization of utterances referring to an action, such as ``ireru(add) ''and ``kiru(cut) ''. Furthermore, we incorporate domain-independent discourse features such as cue phrases, noun/verb chaining, which indicate topic change/persistence, into the case frame. We utilize visual and audio information to achieve robust topic identification. As for visual information, we can utilize background color distribution of the image. As for audio information, silence can be utilized as a clue to a topic shift. Chapter 4 presents a method for automatically acquiring object models from large amounts of video for performing object recognition. We first collect pairs of a close-up image and a keyword. Close-up images are extracted with edge detection and, in the close-up image, region segmentation is performed and the salient region is determined considering the following points: area, center of gravity and variance of pixels in a region. A keyword is extracted from instructor's utterances when the close-up image appears. In case of cooking, objects (i. e. ingredient) change their shape/color along with the progress of cooking. Consequently, good examples for object acquisition cannot be collected from video segments whose topic is sauteing or dishing up. Therefore, a keyword is extracted only from segments whose topic, which is identified by the proposed method, is preparation. The important score of each word is calculated according to the linguistic analysis result, such as the discourse structure analysis and utterance-type detection, and the word that has the maximum score is extracted as a keyword. After collecting pairs of a close-up image and a keyword, for each keyword, its object model is acquired by summing RGB histograms in the salient region. Next, we perform object recognition based on the acquired object model and the discourse structure. We can acquire the object model of around 100 foods and its accuracy is 0. 778, and the accuracy of object recognition is 0. 727. Chapter 5 describes our video retrieval system. In this system, a user can ask a query in natural language and can enjoy the search result, which is similar to the user's query. To present the accessible mean to the video, we generate a summary of the video. This analysis is based on topic segmentation, important utterances extraction, topic identification result, object recognition result. 報告番号: 甲 22808; 学位授与年月日: 2007 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(情報理工学); 学位記番号: 博情第 138 号; 研究科・専攻: 情報理工学系研究科電子情報学専...|$|R
