5|$|Lithium {{reacts with}} water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The {{reaction}} forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually {{stored in a}} hydrocarbon sealant, often petroleum jelly. Though the heavier alkali metals {{can be stored in}} more dense substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a <b>black</b> <b>coating</b> of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).|$|E

2500|$|The centrepiece of the Memorial is {{a seated}} figure of Prince Albert. [...] Following restoration, {{this is now}} covered in gold leaf. [...] For eighty years the statue had been covered in black paint. [...] Various {{theories}} had existed that it was deliberately blackened during World War I to prevent it becoming a target for Zeppelin bombing raids or domestic anti-German sentiment. [...] However, English Heritage's research prior to the restoration suggests that the <b>black</b> <b>coating</b> pre-dates 1914 {{and may have been}} a response to atmospheric pollution that had destroyed the original gold leaf surface. Further restoration work, including re-pointing the steps surrounding the memorial, commenced in the summer of 2006.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{divergence}} of standards.

50|$|In {{the modern}} {{thermopile}} pyranometers the active (hot) junctions of the thermopile are located beneath the <b>black</b> <b>coating</b> surface and are heated by the radiation absorbed from the <b>black</b> <b>coating.</b> The passive (cold) junctions of the thermopile are fully protected from solar radiation and in thermal {{contact with the}} pyranometer housing, {{which serves as a}} heat-sink. This prevents any alteration from yellowing or decay when measuring the temperature in the shade, thus impairing the measure of the solar irradiance.|$|E
