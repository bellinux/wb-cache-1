Detailed measurements of fine particles with sizes below 2.5micrometres (PM2.5) were performed on three of the incinerators: One incinerator equipped with an ESP for particle filtration emitted 5.3g/GJ fine particles, while two incinerators equipped with <b>baghouse</b> filters emitted 0.002 and 0.013g/GJ PM2.5. For ultra fine particles (PM1.0), the numbers were 4.889g/GJ PM1.0 from the ESP plant, while emissions of 0.000 and 0.008g/GJ PM1.0 were measured from the plants equipped with <b>baghouse</b> filters. | first1 = Malene | last1 = Nielsen | first2 = Jytte Boll | last2 = Illerup | first3 = Christian Lange | last3 = Fogh | first4 = Lars Peter | last4 = Johansen | publisher = National Environmental Research Institute of Denmark | format = DOC}} ...|$|E

50|$|An {{understanding}} of the term air-to-cloth ratio is vital to understand the mechanics of any <b>baghouse</b> system regardless of the exact type used.

50|$|In reverse-pulse-jet baghouses, {{individual}} {{bags are}} supported by a metal cage (filter cage), which is fastened onto a cell plate {{at the top of}} the <b>baghouse.</b> Dirty gas enters from the bottom of the <b>baghouse</b> and flows from outside to inside the bags.

50|$|In {{spray drying}} and dry {{injection}} systems, the flue gas {{must first be}} cooled to about 10-20 °C above adiabatic saturation to avoid wet solids deposition on downstream equipment and plugging of <b>baghouses.</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>Baghouses</b> Designed {{to handle}} heavy dust loads, a dust {{collector}} {{consists of a}} blower, dust filter, a filter-cleaning system, and a dust receptacle or dust removal system (distinguished from air cleaners which utilize disposable filters to remove the dust).|$|R
50|$|In cocurrent systems, the {{purge gas}} is 50 °F to 100 °F hotter than the soil {{discharge}} temperature. The {{result is that}} the purge gas exit temperature may range from 400 °F to 1,000 °F and cannot go directly to the <b>baghouse.</b> Purge gas first enters an afterburner to decontaminate the fine particles, then goes into a cooling unit prior to introduction into the <b>baghouse.</b> Because of the higher temperature and volume of the purge gas, the <b>baghouse</b> and all other downstream processing equipment must be larger than in a countercurrent system. Cocurrent systems do have several advantages over countercurrent systems: The afterburner is located upstream of the <b>baghouse</b> ensuring that fine particles are decontaminated; and because the heated purge gas is introduced at the same end of the drum as the feed soil, the soil is heated faster, resulting in a longer residence time. Higher temperatures and longer residence time mean that cocurrent systems can be used to treat soils contaminated with heavier petroleum products. Cocurrent systems are effective for light and heavy petroleum products including No. 6 fuel oil, crude oil, motor oil, and lubricating oil.|$|E

50|$|Most baghouses use long, {{cylindrical}} bags (or tubes) made of woven or {{felted fabric}} as a filter medium. (For applications {{where there is}} relatively low dust loading and gas temperatures are 250 °F or less, pleated, nonwoven cartridges are sometimes used as filtering media instead of bags.) Dust-laden gas or air enters the <b>baghouse</b> through hoppers (large funnel-shaped containers used for storing and dispensing particulate) and is directed into the <b>baghouse</b> compartment. The gas is drawn through the bags, either on the inside or the outside depending on cleaning method, and a layer of dust accumulates on the filter media surface until air can no longer move through it. When sufficient pressure drop (delta P) occurs, the cleaning process begins. Cleaning can take place while the <b>baghouse</b> is online (filtering) or is offline (in isolation). When the compartment is clean, normal filtering resumes.|$|E
