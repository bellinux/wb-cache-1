40|$|International audienceThe active {{selection}} of recent volcanic habitats by juvenile fish following a cyclone {{could explain the}} unusual mass-settlement of the Indian Ocean <b>blacktip</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus oceanicus observed on 25 May 2006, few weeks after tropical storm Diwa on the latest lava flows of the Piton de la Fournaise volcano at Reunion Island. Following a cyclonic depression, shallow underwater habitats are devoid of resident fishes, including predators, favouring juvenile fish survival. Otherwise, the recent origin of the volcanic habitats, which vary in age, could facilitate the spatial segregation of adult and juvenile fish on the lava flows, reducing intraspecific competition and adult aggression toward juveniles. Regional characteristics of larval recruitment could {{also contribute to the}} infrequency of the described event; the isolated situation of the island would be expected to result in an average density of fish postlarvae 0. 25 % to 1 % of that seen on some reefs in the Pacific. The supposed origin of juvenile groupers in the neighbouring island of Mauritius should encourage Reunionese managers to look beyond their own jurisdictions to adopt a collaborative approach to conservation of the entire connected network...|$|E
40|$|International audienceShark feeding is {{widespread}} throughout tropical, subtropical and temperate marine ecosystems and {{gives rise to}} controversy because there is little consensus regarding its management. There are few comprehensive reports that consider how shark feeding with bait might impact local fishes, despite {{the development of this}} practice during the last few decades. Although shark feeding might theoretically have parasitological effects on local non-target fish species in the vicinity of feeding areas, this aspect has never been investigated. During an extensive parasitological survey conducted between 2005 and 2007, a total of 1117 fish belonging to six common grouper and snapper species were sampled throughout the entire north coast of Moorea Island (French Polynesia), encompassing three localities where feeding has occurred frequently since the 1990 s. Parasites exhibited no spatial patterns except for the infections on the <b>blacktip</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus fasciatus). On this species, the prevalence of larval cestodes that parasitise sharks as adults and the intensity of their infestation were significantly higher around shark-feeding localities compared with non-shark-feeding localities. Our results suggest {{for the first time that}} although long-term shark feeding has parasitological implications, the impacts appear limited, only involve cestode larvae from one host species and do not seem to affect the health of the fish we studied...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Two new, one {{known and}} three {{unidentified}} {{species of the}} nematode family Camallanidae are reported and described from the intestines of marine perciform fishes off the southwestern coast of New Caledonia, South Pacific: Camallanus carangis Olsen, 1952 from the forked-tailed threadfin bream Nemipterus furcosus (Nemipteridae), the yellowstriped goatfish Upeneus vittatus and the whitesaddle goatfish Parupeneus ciliatus (both Mullidae) (new host records); Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) variolae sp. n. from the white-edged lyretail Variola albimarginata (type host) and the <b>blacktip</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus fasciatus (both Serranidae); Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) longus sp. n. from the twotone tang Zebrasoma scopas (Acanthuridae); Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) sp. 1 (female tail with 2 terminal spikes on a digit-like projection) from the speckled sand-perch Parapercis hexophtalma (Pinguipedidae); Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) sp. 2 (female tail with 1 spike on a digit-like projection) from the drab emperor Lethrinus ravus (Lethrinidae) and Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) sp. 3 (female tail with a smooth digit-like protrusion) from the two-lined monocle bream Scolopsis bilineata (Nemipteridae). Camallanus paracarangis Velasquez, 1980 is synonymized with C. carangis. Several additional species of Camallanus from marine fish of the Indo-Pacific region may be synonymous with C. carangis as it has a poorly sclerotized left spicule and 3 small caudal projections on the tail of young (i. e., non-gravid) females. The fourth-stage larva of C. carangis is described for the first time. P. (S.) variolae differ...|$|E
40|$|Assessing {{patterns}} of connectivity {{at the community}} and population levels is relevant to marine resource management and conservation. The present study reviews this issue {{with a focus on}} the western Indian Ocean (WIO) biogeographic province. This part of the Indian Ocean holds more species than expected from current models of global reef fish species richness. In this study, checklists of reef fish species were examined to determine levels of endemism in each of 10 biogeographic provinces of the Indian Ocean. Results showed that the number of endemic species was higher in the WIO than in any other region of the Indian Ocean. Endemic species from the WIO on the average had a larger body size than elsewhere in the tropical Indian Ocean. This suggests an effect of peripheral speciation, as previously documented in the Hawaiian reef fish fauna, relative to other sites in the tropical western Pacific. To explore evolutionary dynamics of species across biogeographic provinces and infer mechanisms of speciation, we present and compare the results of phylogeographic surveys based on compilations of published and unpublished mitochondrial DNA sequences for 19 Indo-Pacific reef-associated fishes (rainbow grouper Cephalopholis argus, scrawled butterflyfish Chaetodon meyeri, bluespot mullet Crenimugil sp. A, humbug damselfish Dascyllus abudafur/Dascyllus aruanus, areolate grouper Epinephelus areolatus, <b>blacktip</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus fasciatus, honeycomb grouper Epinephelus merra, bluespotted cornetfish Fistularia commersonii, cleaner wrasse Labroides sp. 1, longface emperor Lethrinus sp.

Heterogeneous and often unbalanced sampling design, paucity of data in a number of cases, and among-species discrepancy in phylogeographic structure precluded any generalization regarding phylogeographic patterns. Nevertheless, the WIO might have been a source of haplotypes in some cases and it also harboured an endemic clade in at least one case. The present survey also highlighted likely cryptic species. This may eventually affect the accuracy of the current checklists of species, which form the basis of some of the recent advances in Indo-West Pacific marine ecology and biogeography...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examined}} {{the biology of}} some commercially exploited reef fishes {{with a view to}} better understanding their life histories and potential vulnerability to fishing or other threats. The focus of this research was comparative age-based demographics of tropical epinepheline serranids (or groupers) from two geographic areas: Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in the western Pacific; and the Seychelles Islands in the western Indian Ocean. The overall aim was to investigate age-based demographics and assemblage structure of tropical epinepheline serranids at multiple scales. The epinepheline fauna in the study areas was partitioned for some analyses into three behavioural groupings based on foraging pattern, crypticity and body size. The behavioural groups are cryptic serranids, roving serranids, and large mobile serranids (Chapter 1). Less is known about cryptic and large mobile serranids than roving serranids in the study areas, so candidate species from those two groups were the focus of the detailed age-based demographic analyses. A comprehensive account of epinepheline assemblages from the GBR and the Seychelles was presented (Chapter 3) using a modified visual survey technique tailored to epinepheline serranids (Chapter 2). I described and compared characteristics of epinepheline serranid faunas at a range of spatial scales from < 1 to 1000 ’s km along natural environmental and geographic gradients on the GBR and the Seychelles Islands, and provided abundance estimates for all three behavioural groups and for the almost 40 species they represent. The typical shallow-water, tropical epinepheline assemblages comprised a handful of abundant species from the cryptic or roving serranid behavioural groups, plus numerous species found only in low densities locally (i. e. rare species, less than 1 fish per 1000 m 2) from each behavioural group. All five characteristics used to describe assemblage structure (i. e. total density of epinepheline serranids; density of each behavioural group; species richness; size structure; and species distribution and abundance) varied at broad spatial scales (100 ’s to 1000 ’s km) and some at finer spatial scales (1 to 100 km). Three approaches were used to explore possible effects of fishing on densities: 1) incorporating the CRC Reef Research Centre’s Effects of Line Fishing Experiment treatments, manipulating fishing level and Marine Park zone status for GBR reefs, into the GBR regional comparison; 2) comparing reefs open and closed to fishing for Lizard outer shelf reefs; and 3) exploring abundance patterns in relation to presumed gradients of historical fishing pressure. Each approach indicated some effects of fishing on epinepheline serranids, but patterns were complex. Comparative demographic analyses were conducted for three species of cryptic serranids, E. fasciatus (<b>blacktip</b> <b>grouper),</b> E. polyphekadion (camouflage grouper) and C. argus (peacock grouper), from the GBR and the Seychelles based on age estimates derived from thin sectioned otoliths (Chapter 4). I described size and age characteristics, longevity, and patterns of growth for each species, and explored broad-scale spatial patterns in demography and the nature of size-age-density relationships for each species in the GBR and the Seychelles. Comparative analyses revealed substantial spatial variation in demographics within and among species. Hence, our ability to generalise about the demography of the cryptic serranids appears to be limited. Linking information on abundance and demography revealed that different combinations of processes may influence local populations of the three species, with the possibility of broad-scale compensatory demographic trade-offs dependent on density noted for two of the three species. Further, lifespans tended to be shorter in the Seychelles than the GBR, suggesting higher recruitment levels and predictability of environmental conditions and resources in the Seychelles than the GBR. I investigated age-specific demographic and reproductive characteristics of E. fuscoguttatus from the GBR and examined implications for resource management (Chapters 5 & 6). Epinephelus fuscoguttatus (brown-marbled grouper or flowery cod) {{is an example of a}} large mobile serranid that is widespread throughout the Indo-Pacific and features strongly in the live reef food fish trade and other reef fisheries. E. fuscoguttatus had an extended lifespan (42 yrs) and unusual reproductive ecology, such as large old females with a reproductive lifespan that may exceed 30 yrs and limited spawning in smaller, younger females until about 9 yrs and 566 mm FL. The spawning period of E. fuscoguttatus in the GBR was relatively narrow (November, December and January). Combined evidence from histological analyses and age-based demographics suggested monandric protogynous hermaphroditism, although confirmation awaits direct evidence of sex change, such as identification of transitional individuals. The two biogeographic-scale studies (Chapters 3 & 4) provided support for the idea that there are fundamental differences in the ecology and population dynamics of reef fish assemblages over biogeographic scales. The contribution of fishing to the observed patterns could not, however, be resolved categorically. While the four aged serranids shared some characteristics associated with high vulnerability to fishing, e. g. relatively slow growth and moderate to long lifespans (20 – 40 yrs), differences among them in abundance, demography and body size, and perhaps in population dynamics, suggested vulnerabilities to fishing may vary. We still lack information on many Indo-Pacific species of epinepheline serranids, and this thesis indicates at least some of these, particularly larger bodied species, may be highly vulnerable to over-fishing or other threat...|$|E
