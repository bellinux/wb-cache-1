5|$|Commenting on {{the usage}} of Tantrism, The New Indian Express Kruthi Grover found {{the death of the}} sorcerer similar to the story of Bhasmasur, a demon in Indian mythology to whom Shiva gives the power to reduce a person to ashes <b>by</b> <b>touching</b> her or his head. When Bhasmasur tries to touch Shiva's head, Vishnu assumes the form of Mohini and makes Bhasmasur touch his own head, killing him. According to Malathi Rangarajan, the film's themes of Tantrism and black magic are {{reminiscent}} of the use of the occult as a plot device in films directed by B. Vittalacharya.|$|E

He could also levitate, {{and he was able}} to defeat the Vision in an aerial conflict between the two.|$|E
5|$|In the {{wilderness}} {{of the dance}} floor, Gaga recognizes the wolf-woman she has become and refuses to misrepresent herself any longer. She notes that in the quiet of the night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction <b>by</b> <b>touching</b> herself. By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that {{it will be difficult to}} maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that she is so content that she would welcome death. These words appear to foreshadow the end of , as the singer alludes to a calm acceptance of her spiritual/ghostly side.|$|E

When the Kindred refuse to allow Scully to treat Brother Aaron, a sick participant at the table, Brother Andrew states that the Kindred take care of their own. Meanwhile, in another nightclub, a man convinces a girl to dance with him <b>by</b> <b>touching</b> her hand.|$|E

5|$|Sabre Wulf is an action-adventure game by Ultimate Play the Game, {{initially}} released for the ZX Spectrum {{home computer}} in 1984. The player navigates the pith-helmeted Sabreman through a 2D jungle maze while collecting amulet pieces {{to bypass the}} guardian at its exit. The player does not receive explicit guidance on how to play and is left to decipher the game's objectives through trial and error. Sabreman moves between the maze's 256 connected screens <b>by</b> <b>touching</b> the border where one screen ends and another begins. Each screen is filled with colourful flora, enemies that spawn at random, and occasional collectibles.|$|E
5|$|Tactile ASL (TASL) is {{a variety}} of ASL used {{throughout}} the United States by and with the deaf-blind. It is particularly common among those with Usher's syndrome. This syndrome results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often {{grow up in the}} Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL. TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced <b>by</b> <b>touching</b> the palms, and there are some grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of non-manual signing.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{a remake}} of the {{original}} NES Mega Man title and has similar gameplay and level designs. The game moves on a 2D plane and players are given control of the game's eponymous hero Mega Man. Unlike the original's 8-bit graphics, the game uses 3D character models with super deformed designs. Mega Man's primary abilities include jumping and shooting and he is given both a health meter and a life meter. Mega Man can lose health <b>by</b> <b>touching</b> enemies or their projectiles, while lives will be lost when Lives will be consumed if Mega Man touches certain spikes, or falls into a pit. Lives and health can be found either dropped by enemies or in fixed locations.|$|E

5|$|Three {{types of}} {{influenza}} viruses affect people, called Type A, Type B, and Type C. Usually, {{the virus is}} spread through the air from coughs or sneezes. This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances. It can also be spread <b>by</b> <b>touching</b> surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. A person may be infectious to others both {{before and during the}} time they are showing symptoms. The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat, sputum, or nose for the virus. A number of rapid tests are available; however, people may still have the infection if the results are negative. A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the virus's RNA is more accurate.|$|E
5|$|Aquaria is a 2D sidescrolling action-adventure game, heavily {{focused on}} {{exploration}} and puzzle-solving, with non-linear gameplay. The player controls Naija, a lone underwater dweller; although {{similar to a}} human woman, Naija also has several fish-like qualities, {{such as the ability}} to breathe underwater and propel herself quickly with webbed feet. The game, originally only available for personal computers, was designed to be primarily controlled solely through the mouse, though it can also be controlled with a keyboard or Xbox 360 controller. The player directs Naija through an underwater world composed of several distinct regions, ranging from caves to underwater ruins to sunlit oases. These areas are filled with plant and animal life, which can be hostile, friendly, or neutral towards her. Hostile plants and animals can hurt Naija, reducing her health meter, <b>by</b> <b>touching</b> her or firing projectiles at her.|$|E
5|$|The {{kings and}} queens regnant of England and the kings of France were the only Christian rulers who claimed the divine gift (divinitus) to cure <b>by</b> <b>touching</b> or {{stroking}} the diseased. This special aptitude {{was thought to be}} evidence of God's high esteem of the two monarchies, though they never agreed upon whose predecessors the ability was first conferred. In England, Saint Edward the Confessor (r. 1042–1066) was said to be the first monarch to possess the healing power of the royal touch. The French, who normally traced the origins of their monarchs' divine gift back to Philip I (r. 1059–1108) or even Robert II (r. 987–1031), denied that Saint Edward used the royal touch. They insisted that the first English monarch to claim the ability was Henry I (r. 1100–1135), and that his touching was a politically influenced imitation of the gift granted exclusively to French monarchs.|$|E

5|$|The mode {{begins as}} Mario and Kirby {{face each other}} on a stadium located in the Smash Bros. world. In this world, when a fighter is defeated, they turn into a trophy form, which can be revived <b>by</b> <b>touching</b> the base. Suddenly, smoke pours from {{the sky and the}} Battleship Halberd flies over. It {{releases}} a stream of black purple-clouded bugs called Shadow Bugs that form the soldiers of the Subspace Army. The Ancient Minister, a cloak-clad, mysterious hovering General of the Subspace Army, arrives with his Army and detonates a Subspace Bomb, which can only be detonated by the sacrifice of two R.O.B.s, and which transports the stadium into Subspace, an alternate dimension where the Subspace Army resides. The Ancient Minister's advance prompts the heroes to progressively team up and attempt to repel the enemy, while villains harvest the power of the allied characters by using dark cannons to convert them into trophies, and using shadow bugs on some of them to fight the protagonists during their adventure.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of charge {{gives rise to}} an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity. A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged <b>by</b> <b>touching</b> it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is charged by the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated {{in the late eighteenth}} century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract.|$|E
5|$|The two try to {{convince}} Sheila to stop the projection, but as she is inexperienced with the device, she instead ends up projecting Steiner to somewhere else. He ends up at a construction site, the hideout of a band of thieves who are attempting to break into a bank. It is learned that an error in the projection has given Steiner the ability to kill people <b>by</b> <b>touching</b> them, and has mutilated one half of his body. Steiner kills the criminals, and then enters a store, where he steals a pair of rubber gloves and a coat. He then breaks into the institute, where he finds Latham and kills him. He also destroys the building's power supply, alerting Hill and Mitchell that something is wrong. By this time, Inspector Davis (Derek Farr) has discovered {{the bodies of the}} criminals and is determined to stop Steiner.|$|E
