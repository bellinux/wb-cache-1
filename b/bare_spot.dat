5|$|This sturdily built {{antelope}} has {{a yellow}} to grayish brown coat. Generally, the bohor reedbuck is yellower than other reedbucks. The large and diffuse sebaceous glands {{present on the}} coat make the coat greasy {{and give it a}} strong odour. Juveniles are darker than the adults as well as long-haired. While R. r. bohor appears yellowish gray, R. r. wardi is richly tinted. The undersides are white in color. A few distinct markings can be observed—such as a dark stripe on the front of each foreleg; white markings under the tail; and a pale ring of hair around the eyes and along the lips, lower jaw, and upper throat. However, R. r. redunca lacks dark stripes on its forelegs. The males have thicker necks. Its large, oval-shaped ears distinguish it from other antelopes. There is a round <b>bare</b> <b>spot</b> below each ear. Apart from sebaceous glands, bohor reedbuck have a pair of inguinal glands and vestigial foot glands, and four nipples. A bohor reedbuck can survive for at least ten years. The tracks of the bohor reedbuck are slightly smaller than those of the southern reedbuck.|$|E

60|$|My breakfast finished, I again {{set out to}} {{see what}} had become of the remains of the deer. In two or three places the sharp hoofs had cut lines in the soft earth, and there were tufts of whitish-gray hair elsewhere.

40|$|<b>Bare</b> <b>spots</b> {{associated}} with vegetation die-off along a tidal channel and adjacent marsh platform in the "Gut" in Wellfleet, MA area are {{a direct result}} of winter storms and increased crab herbivory. Sediment transport from <b>bare</b> <b>spots</b> and channel banks over a two-year time period are captured with the aid of repeat high-definition surveys using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) techniques. Cross-sectional and morphometric analysis of the tidal channel reveal a statistically significant change in channel size and shape with reference to the amount of elevation change from erosion and deposition. Greater than sixty percent of the topographic changes in the marsh channel are the result of erosional processes. Cellular statistics across the marsh platform revealed less change than the channel. Depositional hotspots occur in areas of sudden wetland dieback, while erosion occurs in small depressions adjacent to the tidal channel. More than fifty percent of the marsh platform displays no change over the two-year measurement period...|$|R

60|$|Feeling {{sure that}} Mr. Faulkner was dead he started up, {{and without a}} moment's {{hesitation}} ran into the wood again, in the direction where he had {{thought that he had}} seen a figure. A minute later he came upon some footprints on a <b>bare</b> <b>spot</b> between the trees, where the snow had fallen lightly. Noting the direction they took, he followed at once. He saw no more signs of footprints, but followed the direction as nearly as he could until he came to the farthest side of the wood; then he leaped out into the field beyond, and followed the edge of the wood until he again reached the road. He then turned and went back again, and fifty yards from the point where he had first run out he came upon the footprints again.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{a lovely}} golden day and as I stood {{watching}} the friendly flame clearing the ground for me, I was filled with satisfaction. Suddenly I observed that the line of red was moving steadily against the wind and toward the stacks. My satisfaction changed to alarm.

I tore at the ground in desperation, hoping to make a <b>bare</b> <b>spot</b> which the flame could not leap. I trampled the fire with my bare feet. I beat at it with my hat.

40|$|Abstract: Focusing on {{improving}} the galvanizability {{of the third}} generation automotive steel, the effect of surface oxides morphologies on the galvanizability was studied. The {{results show that the}} surface oxide types of sample steels by XPS analysis after annealing in different conditions are the same, only MnO and Cr 2 O 3 were detected and no complex oxides exist on the surface. Morphologies of surface oxides can greatly influence the galvanizability of the third generation automotive steel, nodule-like oxides surface can contribute to better wettability and inhibition layer than vitreous film-like oxides surface. Galvanizing panels of nodule-like oxides surface steels only show pinhole-sized <b>bare</b> <b>spots,</b> while panels galvanized from vitreous film-like oxide surface steels reveal larger areas of <b>bare</b> <b>spots</b> and uncoated areas. Inhibition layer observed in galvanizing panels of nodule-like oxides surface steels are compact but not homogeneous, some inhibition layer grains are fine, and others are coarse. While the inhibition layer grains of panels galvanized from vitreous film-like oxide surface steels have a non-compact morphology with some particularly fine equiaxed crystals which developed deficiently...|$|R

60|$|One day I {{fortunately}} chanced {{to witness}} a migration from one nest to another, {{and it was a}} most interesting spectacle to behold the masters carefully carrying, as Huber has described, their slaves in their jaws. Another day my attention was struck by about a score of the slave-makers haunting the same spot, and evidently not in search of food; they approached and were vigorously repulsed by an independent community of the slave species (F. fusca); sometimes as many as three of these ants clinging to the legs of the slave-making F. sanguinea. The latter ruthlessly killed their small opponents, and carried their dead bodies as food to their nest, twenty-nine yards distant; but they were prevented from getting any pupae to rear as slaves. I then dug up a small parcel of the pupae of F. fusca from another nest, and put them down on a <b>bare</b> <b>spot</b> near the place of combat; they were eagerly seized, and carried off by the tyrants, who perhaps fancied that, after all, they had been victorious in their late combat.|$|E

60|$|Neil Paraday {{had dropped}} on the garden-bench and sat there at once {{detached}} and confounded; he looked hard at a <b>bare</b> <b>spot</b> in the lawn, as if with an anxiety that had suddenly made him grave. His movement had been interpreted by his visitor as an invitation to sink sympathetically into a wicker chair that stood hard by, and while Mr. Morrow so settled himself I felt he had taken official possession {{and that there was}} no undoing it. One had heard of unfortunate people’s having “a man in the house,” and this was just what we had. There was a silence of a moment, during which we seemed to acknowledge in the only way that was possible the presence of universal fate; the sunny stillness took no pity, and my thought, as I was sure Paraday’s was doing, performed within the minute a great distant revolution. I saw just how emphatic I should make my rejoinder to Mr. Pinhorn, and that having come, like Mr. Morrow, to betray, I must remain as long as possible to save. Not because I had brought my mind back, but because our visitors last words were in my ear, I presently enquired with gloomy irrelevance if Guy Walsingham were a woman.|$|E

Far into the night she lay wide awake, dry-eyed, watching the lamp-lit streets of the little towns they passed, or staring at the cornfields and pastures in the darkness; thinking of the home she had left, perhaps forever, and wondering whether they were sleeping there; picturing them to-morrow at breakfast without her, and Uncle Tom leaving for the bank, Aunt Mary going through the silent rooms alone, and dear old Catherine haunting the little chamber where she had slept for seventeen years--almost her lifetime.
