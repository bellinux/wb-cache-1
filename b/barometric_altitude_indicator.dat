40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{was analyzed}} of the barometric altimeters onboard {{the space shuttle}} orbiter. Altitude estimates from the air data systems including the operational instrumentation and the developmental flight instrumentation were obtained {{for each of the}} approach and landing test flights. By comparing the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> estimates to altitudes derived from radar tracking data filtered through a Kalman filter and fully corrected for atmospheric refraction, the errors in the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitudes</b> were shown to be 4 to 5 percent of the Kalman altitudes. By comparing the altitude determined from the true atmosphere derived from weather balloon data to the altitude determined from the U. S. Standard Atmosphere of 1962, it was determined that the assumption of the Standard Atmosphere equations contributes roughly 75 percent of the total error in the baro estimates. After correcting the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> estimates using an average summer model atmosphere computed for the average latitude of the space shuttle landing sites, the residual error in the altitude estimates was reduced to less than 373 feet. This corresponds to an error of less than 1. 5 percent for altitudes above 4000 feet for all flights...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{barometric}} altimetry is to {{some extent}} a limiting factor on safety, predictability and efficiency of aircraft operations, and reduces {{the potential of the}} trajectory based operations capabilities. However, geometric altimetry could be used to improve all of these aspects. Nowadays aircraft altitude is estimated by applying the International Standard Atmosphere which differs from real altitude. At different temperatures for an assigned <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude,</b> aerodynamic forces are different and this has a direct relationship with time, fuel consumption and range of the flight. The study explores the feasibility of using sensors providing geometric reference altitude, in particular, to supply capabilities for the optimization of vertical profiles and also, their impact on the vertical Air Traffic Management separation assurance processes. One of the aims of the thesis is to assess if geometric altitude fulfils the aeronautical requirements through existing sensors. Also the thesis will elaborate on the advantages of geometric <b>altitude</b> over the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> in terms of efficiency for vertical navigation. The evidence that geometric altitude is the best choice to improve the efficiency in vertical profile and aircraft capacity by reducing vertical uncertainties will also be shown. In this paper, an atmospheric study is presented, as well as the impact of temperature deviation from International Standard Atmosphere model is analyzed in order to obtain relationship between geometric and <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude.</b> Furthermore, an aircraft model to study aircraft vertical profile is provided to analyse trajectories based on geometric altitudes...|$|R

However, a concurrent decifit in heading maintenance was observed only when the <b>altitude</b> <b>indicator</b> was proximal to the path information. These results did not support a model of the concurrent processing deficit based on an inability to attend to multiple locations in parallel. They are consistent with previous claims that the deficit is the product of attentional limits on subjects' ability to process two separate objects (HUD symbology and terrain information) concurrently. The absence of a performance tradeoff when the HUD and the path information were less proximal is attributed to a breaking of attentional tunneling on the HUD, possibly due to eye movements...|$|R

During that transmission, a trainee controller had also transmitted an incorrect QNH (barometric altimeter setting) that was 9 hPa too high. The approach instructions were not fully heard since the pilot had re-keyed his microphone to acknowledge the new QNH, and likely did not hear the second repeat of the 3,000 ft safe altitude, declaring: [...] "We’re re-cleared to 2,000 feet..."

They are located shortly downstream the radome in an area which is significantly influenced by the local flow field. One of the air data parameters provided by this system is the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude.</b> The Bundeswehr Technical and Airworthiness Center for Aircraft (WTD 61) sought a deeper insight into the calibration of the air data system {{and the performance of}} the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> measurement. Therefore, flight tests were initiated in cooperation with the German Aero-space Center (DLR). While initial data was gained by a relatively small joint WTD 61 and DLR team, the results necessitated to extend the program and with it the number of involved partners. The key factor for success was now a common understanding of what could be done to improve the ADS performance. Apart from the technical aspects, the project {{is a good example of}} a successful cooperation among several and changing partners from different organizations and nations in one test team. This paper provides an overview of the results and their consequences, different approaches for the validation of the findings and the evolving need to cooperate in order to improve the performance of the ADS.

40|$|In {{the age of}} {{information}} the ability to navigate persons and equipment has become increasingly important. A rising number of applications and services depend on the precise positioning that is provided by global satellite positioning systems such as the GPS. However, most people using satellite-based positioning services {{are living in the}} most challenging surroundings for the satellite positioning systems - densely populated cities. Fundamentally, satellite navigation is based on distance measurements from the receiver to satellite vehicles in orbit of the Earth. The receiver determines its location - latitude, longitude, and elevation - and the system time using the satellite positioning system. The determined location is only an estimate: residual errors induce inaccuracies to the determination process. At worst, the receiver {{may not be able to}} determine its position if not enough signals could be acquired. The performance of the receiver could be greatly improved if one or more of the geographic coordinates or the precise time could be obtained from another source with smaller error. One such source is Earth's atmospheric pressure which is relative to the altitude and from which a receiver can deduce its altitude if a reference pressure level is known. To address the problem of unavailability and inaccuracy of positioning in urban environment, a barometric assistance service was designed and a respective software application was implemented. The implemented assistance service generates continuously time and location-dependent reference pressure data from high resolution weather forecasts that are calculated by the Finnish Meteorological Institute. Receivers with the barometric sensor can download the assistance data from the service and utilize it to determine the current <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> consistently and more accurately than a conventional receiver. <b>Barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> measurements improve the availability of the positioning service and reduce the time required for the first position estimate by decreasing the number of required satellite measurements...|$|R
50|$|To {{the left}} and right of the {{attitude}} indicator are usually the airspeed and <b>altitude</b> <b>indicators,</b> respectively. The airspeed indicator displays the speed of the aircraft in knots, while the <b>altitude</b> <b>indicator</b> displays the aircraft's altitude above mean sea level (AMSL). These measurements are conducted through the aircraft's pitot system, which tracks air pressure measurements. As in the PFD's attitude indicator, these systems are merely displayed data from the underlying mechanical systems, and do not contain any mechanical parts (unlike an aircraft's airspeed indicator and altimeter). Both of these indicators are usually presented as vertical “tapes”, which scroll up and down as altitude and airspeed change. Both indicators may often have “bugs”, that is, indicators that show various important speeds and altitudes, such as V speeds calculated by a flight management system, do-not-exceed speeds for the current configuration, stall speeds, selected altitudes and airspeeds for the autopilot, and so on.|$|R

The first section after an introduction and a motivation for the possible benefits introduces the proposed method which follows mainly the idea of <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> aiding. After an initial positioning solution the radar altimeter measurement and digital terrain elevation data are used to create additional ranging information in vertical direction. The next section discusses the uncertainties in this additional measurement. Apart from the obvious measurement noise, special focus is put on the look-up of terrain elevation data, since this is the most critical step in the process. Finally this method is tested with flight trial data from late 2009. The results clearly show the potential but also the remaining issues of the proposed method...|$|R

50|$|Label {{guidelines}} are provided {{as part of}} the ARINC 429 specification, for various equipment types. Each aircraft will contain a number of different systems, such as flight management computers, inertial reference systems, air data computers, radar altimeters, radios, and GPS sensors. For each type of equipment, a set of standard parameters is defined, which is common across all manufacturers and models. For example, any air data computer will provide the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> of the aircraft as label 203. This allows some degree of interchangeability of parts, as all air data computers behave, for the most part, in the same way. There are {{only a limited number of}} labels, though, and so label 203 may have some completely different meaning if sent by a GPS sensor, for example. Very commonly needed aircraft parameters, however, use the same label regardless of source.

40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to flight testing phase of unmanned air vehicle "Pegas", designed for large-scale aerial photographs, but the technique {{can be used for}} testing and other aircraft. Flight tests {{are an important part of}} the process of developing new types of the aircraft. According to the results, the accuracy of the selected parameters of the aircraft and the congruence of the real machine parameters to the mathematical model calculation were checked. To verify the flight characteristics of the results of the tests it was necessary to obtain the true values of flight parameters, but their measurement was complicated by the presence of errors and other factors that affect to results. In this article the method of processing the objective data was considered to determine the aerodynamic flight characteristics of the aircraft, the magnitude of errors of onboard measuring devices, the direction and the speed of the wind at the <b>altitude.</b> The <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> and speed sensors and GPS sensor were used for noting the flight parameters. The accuracy of data sensors was unknown. The barometric altimeter data and GPS altitude were compared and analyzed to determine the true altitude. Despite the specific of characteristics of GPS sensor, some data were excluded from proceedings. The schedule of the difference between <b>barometric</b> and GPS <b>altitude</b> depending on the <b>barometric</b> relative <b>altitude</b> was constructed and totally analyzed. From these data specifying factor to determine the true relative <b>altitude</b> according to <b>barometric</b> sensor was derived. The next step was to define the true speed. This analysis was consisted on the dependence of the difference between the barometric and GPS speed according to the course of flight. The schedule had the sinusoidal dependence. Midline shift corresponded the accuracy level of the barometric speed sensor. The dimension of half amplitude of the schedule corresponded to the force of wind and the position of the largest difference corresponded to the rate of wind. Therefore, using this schedule the direction and the speed of the wind and accuracy of barometric airspeed sensor were quickly determined. In real example there were defined the true flight options and derived qualifying ratios. We have proved the feasibility and validity of the developed method. ?????? ????????? ????? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ???????????? ????????. ? ?????? ??????????????? ???????? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????? ? ????? ??????????? ???????????????? ?????? ????????????? ????????, ??????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????, ??????????? ??????????? ? ???????? ????? ?? ???????. ??????????? ? ????????????????? ??????????? ???????? ????????????? ???????? ? ??????? ????????????? ???? ????????????. ?? ???????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ? ????????????? ?????? ??????, ??????????? ? ???????? ?????, ??????????? ????????, ??????? ??????????????...|$|R
