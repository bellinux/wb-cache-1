5|$|The menu at the White House Passover Seder {{featured}} traditional American Jewish Passover cuisine such as gefilte fish, charoset, {{chicken soup}} with matzah balls, <b>brisket,</b> potato kugel, and macaroons. Salads and vegetable side dishes completed the menu. Lesser brought handmade shmurah matzah from the Chabad-Lubavitch center in Springfield, Massachusetts. Family recipes were emphasized: in 2015, these recipes included matzo ball soup from Ziskend's grandmother, carrot soufflé from Lesser's mother, and Raspberry Ganache Marjolaine from Chaudhary's mother. Recipes covered foods {{from both the}} Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions. The food was not strictly kosher, but kosher style. In 2014, the White House Passover Seder began inviting a guest chef to coordinate the menu with the White House executive chef.|$|E
5|$|Without {{ultrasound}} {{or other}} special tools, determining if a sheep is pregnant is difficult. Ewes only begin to visibly show a pregnancy {{about six weeks}} before giving birth, so shepherds often rely {{on the assumption that}} a ram will impregnate all the ewes in a flock. However, by fitting a ram with a chest harness called a marking harness that holds a special crayon (or raddle, sometimes spelled reddle), ewes that have been mounted are marked with a color. Dye may also be directly applied to the ram's <b>brisket.</b> This measure is not used in flocks where wool is important, since the color of a raddle contaminates it.|$|E
60|$|As to {{the good}} sense of Mr. <b>Brisket's</b> remarks, there was no {{difference}} of opinion between him and his intended wife. Miss Brown would at that time have been quite contented to enter into partnership for life on those terms. And though these memoirs are written with the express view of advocating a theory of trade founded on quite a different basis, nevertheless, it may be admitted that Mr. <b>Brisket's</b> view of commerce has its charms, presuming that a man has the wherewithal. But such a view is apt to lose its charms in female eyes if it be insisted on too often, or too violently. Maryanne had long since given in her adhesion to Mr. <b>Brisket's</b> theory; but now, weary with repetition of the lesson, she was disposed to rebel.|$|R

5|$|The {{stock is}} {{typically}} made by boiling meat, bones, or both. Beef, pork {{or a combination}} of both are most commonly used, with <b>brisket,</b> ribs, shank and chuck considered to give the most flavorful results, especially if cooked on a high flame. Marrow bones are considered best for the bone stock. Meat stock is usually cooked for about two hours, whereas bone stock takes four to six hours to prepare. Meat and bones are usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10–15 minutes before the borscht is done. Some recipes call for smoked meats, resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht, while others use poultry or mutton stock. Fasting varieties are typically made with fish stock to avoid the use of meat, while purely vegetarian recipes often substitute forest mushroom broth for the stock.|$|E
25|$|The broth for {{the dish}} {{can be either}} a mixture of two broths, made from beef tripe and <b>brisket,</b> respectively, or gomtang, a thin soup with a rich flavor made by {{simmering}} beef bones for a long time. If choosing the first type, the beef tripe and <b>brisket</b> have to be boiled separately because beef tripe has strong flavor that can affect the <b>brisket</b> broth and the meat. To make the beef tripe broth, cleaned beef tripe, onions, scallions, garlic, and ginger are placed {{in a large pot}} with a large amount of water and boiled until thoroughly cooked. Likewise, the <b>brisket</b> broth is prepared using the same method, using the same secondary ingredients to remove any bad odors that might persist. After that, both broths are chilled, and any fat floating on the surface is skimmed off. The cooked <b>brisket</b> is cut into bite-sized pieces, while the yang and gopchang are cut into long, diagonal strips. The boiled beef tripe and <b>brisket</b> are marinated with seasonings and kneaded for a long time.|$|E
25|$|Kansas City-style {{barbecue}} {{is characterized}} by its use {{of different types of}} meat, including pulled pork, pork ribs, burnt ends, smoked sausage, beef <b>brisket,</b> beef ribs, smoked/grilled chicken, smoked turkey, and sometimes fish—a variety attributable to Kansas City's history as a center for meat packing. Hickory is the primary wood used for smoking in Kansas City, while the sauces are typically tomato based with sweet, spicy, and tangy flavors.|$|E

25|$|In a pan, the {{remaining}} vegetables {{are placed on}} the bottom, and the marinated beef tripe and <b>brisket</b> are placed over them in a circular fashion. The shredded mushrooms and sliced vegetables are arranged between the tripe and meat. The prepared broths are mixed together, seasoned with salt, and poured little by little into the pan. When the dish is cooked, any floating foam is skimmed off and the gopchang jeongol is served.|$|E
25|$|Pho {{is served}} in a bowl with a {{specific}} cut of white rice noodles in clear beef broth, with thin cuts of beef (steak, fatty flank, lean flank, <b>brisket).</b> Variations feature tendon, tripe, or meatballs in southern Vietnam. Chicken pho is made using the same spices as beef, but the broth is made using only chicken bones and meat, {{as well as some}} internal organs of the chicken, such as the heart, the undeveloped eggs and the gizzard.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} recipes for cholent. Ingredients vary {{according}} to the geographic areas of Europe where the Jews lived and especially the personal preferences of the cook. The core ingredient of a traditional cholent is beef, usually shoulder, <b>brisket,</b> flanken, or any other cut that becomes tender and flavorful in long slow cooking. The meat is placed in a pot with peeled potatoes, any type or size of beans, and grains (barley, hulled wheat, rice). The mixture is lightly seasoned, mainly salt and pepper, and water is added to the pot to create a stew-like consistency during slow cooking.|$|E

25|$|Cheese, pepperoni, veggie, or combo pizza is also {{available}} in most locations, and can usually be ordered to go, making Costco arguably the 14th largest pizza chain in the US in 2010. Frozen yogurt is also served in chocolate, vanilla, or swirl. Costco also offers berry smoothies, latte freeze (without chocolate), mocha freeze (with chocolate), beef bake, chicken bake, turkey provolone sandwiches, twisted churros, chicken Caesar salads, beef <b>brisket</b> sandwiches, beef chili with beans, and in some locations, gelato. French fries are also offered in some locations. Some of the food court items are only available in certain countries. For example, the bulgogi bake is only available in Korea and Japan and poutine is only available in Canada. The nutrition data for the Costco Food Court items is posted online.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{barbecue}} restaurants {{may offer}} dishes that are slow-smoked or barbecued over a grill. Fare includes barbecue sandwiches, <b>brisket,</b> barbecue chicken, pulled pork, pork shoulder, pork ribs, beef ribs, beefsteak and other foods. Various side dishes are typically available, such as baked beans, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw and {{corn on the}} cob, among others. A variety of barbecue sauces may be available, and some barbecue restaurants bottle their own sauces for customer purchase. Some barbecue restaurants prepare their foods without any sauces, and may not offer any as condiments. This may occur per a preference for {{the flavor of the}} meats to stand on their own, rather than being accentuated with flavors from sauces. Some barbecue restaurants use a dry spice rub to flavor meats.|$|E
25|$|Two {{important}} staples in {{the diet}} are seafood and beef, the latter playing {{a larger role in}} the cuisine of Sonora than in the rest of Mexico. Beef is often cooked over an open flame, and Sonorans prefer robust cuts such as <b>brisket</b> and skirt steak. Machaca, or carne seca, is still enjoyed, although refrigeration has eliminated the need to dry meat. Sonora also has a reputation for producing fine cuts of beef, but the lean Spanish cattle of the colonial period have been replaced by Angus, Herefords and Holsteins. Dishes based on or usually containing beef include carne desebrada, carne con rajas verdes, burritos, carne con chile colorado, beef chorizo, carne seca, machaca, menudo, gorditas and meatballs. Seafood is an important staple, especially along the coast as there is a large variety of fish and shellfish in the Gulf of California. Seafood is generally cooked in very simple dishes, such as fish tacos, seafood soups, rice with shrimp or squid and shrimp meatballs. Favored fish include cabrilla, flounder, marlin, sardines, manta rays and various types of jacks.|$|E
50|$|Warm Montreal {{smoked meat}} is always sliced by hand {{in order to}} {{maintain}} its form since doing so with a meat slicer would cause the tender meat to disintegrate. Whole <b>briskets</b> are kept steaming and sliced up on demand when ordered in the restaurant.|$|R

500|$|Esparza's Tex Mex Cafe, {{or simply}} Esparza's, was a Tex-Mex {{restaurant}} in Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Opened by Martha and Joe Esparza in 1990, the restaurant operated {{for more than}} 24 years before closing in January 2014. Its unusual menu included buffalo tostadas, ground ostrich and nopalitos, several varieties of tongue, beef <b>brisket,</b> and more traditional options such as enchiladas, quesadillas, tacos and tamales. Esparza's was one of Portland's most popular restaurants during the 1990s and was named [...] "Restaurant of the Year" [...] by The Oregonian in 1992.|$|E
500|$|Esparza's, {{located at}} the {{intersection}} of SE 28th Avenue and SE Ankeny Street in Portland's Buckman neighborhood, served Tex-Mex cuisine. Opening in 1990, it became one of Portland's most popular restaurants. The Portland Mercury described Esparza's as a [...] "quaint little cafe" [...] with [...] "interesting" [...] menu options, including buffalo tostadas, ground ostrich and nopalitos (cactus deep-fried in cornmeal batter). It served several varieties of tongue, including beef, buffalo, calf, lamb, pork and venison. The menu also included beef <b>brisket</b> ("Smiley Burnette") and more traditional options such as enchiladas, quesadillas, tacos and tamales, with most entrees ranging from $9–11. The most expensive entree on the menu cost $12.95, making Esparza's known for its reasonable pricing.|$|E
500|$|Ashkenazi Jews {{living in}} Eastern Europe adopted {{beetroot}} borscht from their Slavic neighbors and adapted {{it to their}} taste and religious requirements. As combining meat with milk is proscribed by kosher dietary laws, Jews have developed two variants of the soup: meat (...) and dairy (...) [...] The meat variant is typically made from beef <b>brisket</b> (pork is never used) and cabbage, while the dairy one is vegetarian, blended with sour cream or a mixture of milk and egg yolks. Both variants typically contain beetroots and onions, and are flavored with beet sour, vinegar or citric acid for tartness and beet sugar for sweetness. Galician Jews traditionally liked their borscht particularly sweet. Jewish borscht may be served either hot or cold, typically with a hot boiled potato on the side. In prewar Eastern Europe it was traditionally put up to ferment around Purim {{so that it would}} be ready four weeks later for the Passover holiday.|$|E
50|$|Lamb {{and goat}} meat is also {{preserved}} as samarella, made very salty {{to prevent the}} fatty lamb meat from going rancid. Very popular amongst both communities is preserved beef. The whole silversides and <b>briskets</b> are salted and spiced quite powerfully to make pastourma/bastirma. The same meat and some fat is chopped finely and made into pastourma-loukaniko sausages.|$|R

500|$|The {{restaurant}} did {{not receive}} universal acclaim, however. In a negative review for The Portland Mercury in 2000, Robin Rosenberg wrote: ... one expects the food at Esparza's to be something special; You might think that the line trickling out the door on a Thursday night {{is an indication of}} exceptional Tex-Mex, worth a considerable sum. Well, certainly, Esparza's dècor, an amalgam of Western nostalgia, Texan brawn, and Tijuana cheese is executed with flair. Unfortunately though, no thematic coup can compensate for the fact that Esparza's food rarely exceeds mediocre, and never lives up to its price... The bulk of the clientele resides in a comfortable economic bracket and come down to the gritty Eastside to quaff top shelf margaritas and feast on manic kitsch. The hot corn chips and fresh salsa, which come fast and free, are the height of the meal. Smoked salmon enchiladas are just wrong; No quantity of barbecue sauce (in this case, cloying and acrid) is going to improve a tough, dry <b>brisket.</b> The pork tacos are equally dry, but the ground buffalo enchiladas are very macho and spicy (though they will linger painfully)... The beans and rice that accompany most entrees are utterly flavorless, a gratuitous use of space on the plate. Some people like beans and rice; Esparza's doesn't seem to care. It's a troublesome adage, 'you get what you pay for,' when you've gorged on flash and formula—and yet, you're starved for a good meal.|$|E
