5|$|In the Robinson Crusoe economy, {{there is}} only one {{individual}} – Robinson Crusoe himself. He acts both as a producer to maximise profits, as well as consumer to maximise his utility. The possibility of trade can be introduced by adding another person to the economy. This person is Crusoe's friend, Man Friday. Although in the novel he plays the role of Crusoe's servant, in the Robinson Crusoe economy he is considered as another actor with equal decision making abilities as Crusoe. Along with this, conditions of Pareto Efficiency can be analysed <b>by</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> the concept of the Edgeworth box.|$|E

He {{took charge of}} the team for the home match against Crawley, which finished a 2–2 draw after Lewis Killeen scored the rebound from a Thomas Pinault penalty in the 90th minute. Former Port Vale manager Martin Foyle was appointed as manager, with Redfearn taking the role of assistant manager. Foyle made his first signing <b>by</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> winger Adam Smith on loan from Conference North club Gainsborough Trinity. Foyle's first match in charge was a 1–1 away draw against Salisbury City, which was earned following a Brodie goal in the 83rd minute.|$|E

50|$|The Joseph Brings House, {{also known}} as the Johan and Maria Magdalena Schilliger House, is a {{historical}} residence in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States, built of local limestone. Originally located at 314 Smith Avenue North, the home was built between 1859 and 1862 by John Schilliger and purchased <b>by</b> <b>Brings</b> <b>in</b> 1863.

5|$|After this success, which {{secured the}} Balkans, Maurice {{intended}} to consolidate Roman control <b>by</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> Armenian settlers {{who would be}} given land in exchange for military service. To this end, Priscus was sent to Armenia to recruit men and their families. His mission there, however, {{was interrupted by a}} large-scale military revolt that brought about the downfall of Maurice. In 602, Maurice again ordered his troops on the Danube frontier to winter north of the river. Again, this provoked widespread discontent, and when Peter, who had replaced Priscus, refused to bow down and rescind the order, an outright mutiny broke out. The army chose the officer Phocas as its new leader and marched down to Constantinople. Without any credible military forces of his own, Maurice had to flee, but was captured with his family and executed by Phocas, who now became emperor.|$|E
5|$|Different {{climatic factors}} {{influence}} {{the climate of}} Buenos Aires. The semi–permanent South Atlantic High influences its climate throughout the year <b>by</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> moist winds from the northeast, which bring most of the precipitation to {{the city in the}} form of frontal systems during winter or storms produced by cyclogenesis in autumn and winter. The hot temperatures and high insolation in the summer months form a low pressure system called the Chaco Low over northern Argentina, generating a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the city – because of this, summer is the rainiest season. In contrast, this low pressure system weakens in the winter, which combined with strong southerly winds results in a drier season due to weaker easterly winds. Being located in the Pampas, Buenos Aires has variable weather due to the passage of contrasting air mass – the cold, dry Pampero from the south and warm, humid tropical air from the north. The coastal location results in a strong maritime influence, causing extreme temperatures (hot or cold) to be rare.|$|E
5|$|Stockport County's {{traditional}} kit colours {{are blue}} and white, {{although they have}} played in other colours throughout their history. Originally competing in blue and white striped jerseys and white shorts, they experimented with red and white stripes in the early 1900s, and from the mid-1930s to mid-1960s played in white jerseys and black shorts. No set pattern has been established for the club's use of blue and white as main colours, as they have played at various times in a white jersey with a blue band and blue shorts and a blue jersey with white pin stripes and white shorts. They made a short experiment with an Argentina-style kit, light blue and white stripes with black shorts, after the 1978 World Cup. This was abandoned after {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War, and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s. County marked their 125th anniversary during 2008 <b>by</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> a third kit – a gold colour with black trim. The kit was worn on 17 occasions, all away trips. The strip was retired 'undefeated' {{at the end of the}} year, having been worn for 13 victories and 4 draws. The kit was also worn during a match against Chester City which was abandoned after 59 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Tennessee {{was ranked}} No. 13 in the Associated Press preseason poll {{at the start}} of the season, but won just one game in its first four of the season, causing the Volunteers to drop out of the top 25 for the first time since 1989, {{breaking}} a streak of 84 consecutive weeks in the poll. To make matters worse, Tennessee's two starting quarterbacks suffered season-ending injuries during that four-game span. In the Volunteers' season-opener against UCLA, Jerry Colquitt suffered a knee injury. Backup quarterback Todd Helton was hurt in the fourth game of the season, a loss to Mississippi State. In response to the poor start, Fulmer overhauled his defense and coped with the loss of his first- and second-string quarterbacks <b>by</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> acclaimed freshman Peyton Manning, son of National Football League star Archie Manning.|$|E
5|$|Smith made {{a return}} to {{management}} with Oxford on 10 September 1993, and the following day led them to a 4–2 victory over his former club Bristol City. A victory over another former club, Stoke, took Oxford off {{the bottom of the}} Second Division, but a sequence of just 2 wins in 17 matches left them in great danger of relegation. He signed goalkeeper Phil Whitehead on loan from Barnsley, signed striker John Byrne (£50,000 from Millwall) {{for the third time in}} his career, and then made what he later said was the best signing of his career <b>by</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> defender Matt Elliott from Scunthorpe United for £170,000. Oxford were boosted by these arrivals and briefly exited the relegation zone, also claiming an FA Cup giant-killing over Leeds at Elland Road after Jim Magilton scored the winning goal in extra time. However, after the match Magilton moved to Southampton for a £600,000 fee. Oxford had struggled in the league during their FA Cup run and were 15 points short of safety with 16 matches to play, but were aided by £60,000 signing Paul Moody, who, despite arriving in February 1994, managed to finish as the club's top-scorer with 12 goals in 15 appearances. His arrival kick-started the club's fightback, and Oxford closed the 15 points gap in just 9 matches. However, a difficult run-in left Oxford needing to beat Notts County on the last day of the season and hope results elsewhere went their way, and though they beat County their relegation rivals also claimed victories and Oxford were relegated.|$|E
