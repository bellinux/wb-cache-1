5|$|At the 1932 occasion, Tesla {{claimed he}} had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays. In 1933, at age 77, Tesla told reporters that, after thirty-five years of work, {{he was on the}} verge of {{producing}} proof of a new form of energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was “violently opposed” to Einsteinian physics, and could be tapped with an apparatus that would <b>be</b> <b>cheap</b> to run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.|$|E
25|$|The third {{step from}} {{political}} economy to economics was {{the introduction of}} marginalism and the proposition that economic actors made decisions based on margins. For example, a person decides to buy a second sandwich based on how full {{he or she is}} after the first one, a firm hires a new employee based on the expected increase in profits the employee will bring. This differs from the aggregate decision making of classical political economy in that it explains how vital goods such as water can <b>be</b> <b>cheap,</b> while luxuries can be expensive.|$|E

25|$|Efficiency of pollination: {{the rewards}} given to pollinators (commonly nectar or pollen or both, but {{sometimes}} oil, scents, resins, or wax) may be costly to produce. Nectar can <b>be</b> <b>cheap,</b> but pollen is generally expensive {{as it is}} relatively high in nitrogen compounds. Plants have evolved to obtain the maximum pollen transfer for the minimum reward delivered. Different pollinators, because of their size, shape, or behaviour, have different efficiencies of transfer of pollen. And the floral traits affect efficiency of transfer: columbine flowers were experimentally altered and presented to hawkmoths, and flower orientation, shape, and colour were found to affect visitation rates or pollen removal.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s {{private housing}} was {{developed}} in Docklands which with some minor exceptions {{were the first to}} be built in the area. Soon many people from outside the area saw the opportunity of buying a house close to the city at what appeared to <b>be</b> <b>cheap</b> prices. On many of the developments, local council tenants were given first opportunities to buy at discounted prices, but this led to a number of abuses. Then again in the late 1990s, London had a huge house-price boom. By encouraging the development of attractive waterside apartments along the River Thames and the old docks, the LDDC brought new, middle-class residents into the area, closely followed by shops, restaurants and bars.|$|E
25|$|Canadian refineries, {{outside of}} the major oil {{producing}} provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, were originally built {{on the assumption that}} light and medium crude oil would continue to <b>be</b> <b>cheap</b> in the long term, and that imported oil would be cheaper than oil sands production. With new oil sands production coming on production at lower prices than international oil, market price imbalances have ruined the economics of refineries which could not process it. Most of the Canadian oil refineries which closed were in the oil deficient regions of Quebec, the Atlantic Provinces, and British Columbia where they had no access to cheaper domestic Canadian production. They also were not designed to refine the heavier grades which comprised most new Canadian production. These refinery closures were part of an international trend, since about a dozen refineries in Europe, the Caribbean and along the US east coast have shut down recent years due to sharp increases in the cost of imported oil and declining domestic demand for fuel.|$|E

25|$|According to Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder {{from the}} Center for Responsible Nanotechnology {{as well as}} Anders Sandberg from the Future of Humanity Institute {{molecular}} manufacturing is the application of nanotechnology that poses the most significant global catastrophic risk. Several nanotechnology researchers state {{that the bulk of}} risk from nanotechnology comes from the potential to lead to war, arms races and destructive global government. Several reasons have been suggested why the availability of nanotech weaponry may with significant likelihood lead to unstable arms races (compared to e.g. nuclear arms races): (1) A large number of players may be tempted to enter the race since the threshold for doing so is low; (2) the ability to make weapons with molecular manufacturing will <b>be</b> <b>cheap</b> and easy to hide; (3) therefore lack of insight into the other parties' capabilities can tempt players to arm out of caution or to launch preemptive strikes; (4) molecular manufacturing may reduce dependency on international trade, a potential peace-promoting factor; (5) wars of aggression may pose a smaller economic threat to the aggressor since manufacturing is cheap and humans may not be needed on the battlefield.|$|E
500|$|Hanna quickly {{realized}} that the currency issue struck an emotional chord in many Americans, and decided on a campaign to persuade the voter that [...] "sound money", the gold standard unless modified by international agreement, was much preferable to bimetallism. Such propaganda would not <b>be</b> <b>cheap,</b> as {{before the age of}} television and radio, the most effective way of reaching the electorate was through the written word, and through public speakers who would address meetings on behalf of the candidate. This would take money, and Hanna undertook to secure it from his corporate connections. As Hanna began his fundraising efforts in late July, the Populists met in St. Louis. Faced with splitting the silver vote, they chose to endorse Bryan, beginning their dissolution as a party.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} other two primary races, the Zerg are the subject of a full {{campaign}} in each of the series' real-time strategy video games. Zerg units are designed to <b>be</b> <b>cheap</b> and fast to produce, encouraging players to overwhelm their opponents with sheer numerical advantage. Since the release of StarCraft the Zerg have become a video gaming icon, described by PC Gamer UK as [...] "the best race in strategy history". The term [...] "Zerg Rush" [...] or [...] "zerging" [...] has entered video gaming lexicon to describe sacrificing economic development in favour of using many low-cost fast/weak units to rush and overwhelm an enemy by attrition or sheer numbers. The tactic is infamous, with most experienced real-time strategy players being familiar with the tactic in one form or another.|$|E

2500|$|After all-jet {{training}} program trials during the 1950s, {{a variety of}} propeller-driven aircraft was used for pilot training during the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1970s, oil prices rapidly increased {{with the price of}} a crude oil barrel having risen from $3 in 1973 to $36 by 1980, deflating the Brazilian economy. At that time, the Brazilian Air Force operated the J69-powerered Cessna T-37C, which was a 1950s design and following the 1970s energy crisis, became expensive to operate. [...] In 1977, the Brazilian Air Force expressed a desire to replace the T-37, specifying that the replacement would need to <b>be</b> <b>cheap</b> to operate, designed to closely imitate the characteristics of jet aircraft and should have ejection seats.|$|E
2500|$|The Chilton D.W.1 was {{designed}} and built on the Chilton Lodge estate at Leverton near Hungerford in Berkshire in early 1937 by two ex de Havilland Technical School students who formed Chilton Aircraft Limited for the purpose. The aircraft was intended to <b>be</b> <b>cheap</b> to build and operate, yet have an exceptional performance on low power. This was derived from its aerodynamically clean design with an all-wood airframe with plywood skin. Only the control surfaces and {{the trailing edge of}} the wing behind the rear spar were fabric covered. [...] The wing also carried trailing edge split flaps. [...] The undercarriage was enclosed in trouser fairings and a cabin top could be fitted.|$|E

[...] The initial costs would be high in order to produce the manufacturing processes, but after that they should <b>be</b> <b>cheap.</b> [...] The way third generation solar cells will be able to improve efficiency is to absorb a wider range of frequencies. [...] The current thin film technology has been limited to one frequency due to the use of single band gap devices.|$|E

2500|$|Rover's U.S. Willys Jeep-inspired Land Rover 4x4 {{launched}} in 1948 {{proved to be}} a worldwide success. Although only intended to be a post-war stopgap, within two years it was vastly outselling the company's principal line of semi-luxury cars. The Land Rover had been designed to <b>be</b> <b>cheap,</b> simple to manufacture, and suitable for hard work in rural terrain, with minimal concessions toward comfort. [...] On early vehicles, the canvas hood, passenger seats and even doors were optional extras. Rover shortly realized that a market existed for an off-road capable vehicle with more amenities. In 1949 the Land Rover station wagon was released, with a coach-built wood-framed body by Tickford. However, the high price of adding such car-like features as seven seats, floor carpets, a heater, a one-piece windscreen sresulted in fewer than 700 being sold before being dropped in 1951.|$|E
2500|$|Secondary gliders {{were meant}} to be used by student pilots after an {{introduction}} to flight on very simple primary gliders. [...] Both types needed to <b>be</b> <b>cheap</b> to build, given the difficult financial position of many Germans after World War I and also simple enough that skilled amateur builders, both within and without gliding clubs, could successfully construct them from plans. [...] The primary/secondary glider concept took shape shortly after the absorption of the Martens gliding school on the Wasserkuppe into Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft (RRG) at the end of 1925. Martens chief instructor Fritz Stamer and Alexander Lippisch were brought together to produce two such gliders and within a few days the Zögling (...) and the Prufling designs were complete. Some parts, for example the wings {{and to a lesser extent}} the horizontal tails, of the two aircraft were similar.|$|E

For inspiration, Hensleigh and cinematographer Conrad W. Hall looked at dozens of action films from the 1960s and 1970s, such as the Dirty Harry series, The Getaway, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, The Godfather and Bonnie and Clyde. In an interview, Hensleigh also stated the film pays homage to Mad Max and William Shakespeare's Othello, though while he was inspired by Othello, the characters were reversed for the film, making the Punisher the instigator of the jealousy which leads to Howard Saint murdering his best friend and wife.|$|E
