5|$|At Khe Sanh, the U.S. Marines {{held the}} high ground, and their {{artillery}} forced the North Vietnamese {{to use their}} own artillery from a much greater distance. By contrast, at Điện Biên Phủ, the French artillery (six 105mm <b>batteries</b> <b>and</b> one battery of four 155mm howitzers and mortars) was only sporadically effective;Furthermore, by 1968, the American military presence in Vietnam dwarfed that of the French, and included numerous technological advances such as effective helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Beginning around 1 pm, Union {{artillery}} fired first, initially upon infantry in the woods, {{and later}} upon any Confederate artillery that attempted {{to move into}} firing position. On the Confederate left flank, two batteries from Whiting's division and one from Jackson's soon began firing from their position upon Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, who were {{near the center of}} the Union line. This began a fierce firefight, with the Union's eight <b>batteries</b> <b>and</b> 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate <b>batteries</b> <b>and</b> sixteen guns. The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery and made their position untenable. The other two Confederate batteries, placed by Jackson himself, were in somewhat better positions, and managed to keep firing. Over a period of more than three hours, a total of six or eight Confederate batteries engaged the Union Army from the Confederate left flank, but they were usually engaged only one at a time.|$|E

5|$|By January 1917 the 3rd Division's {{artillery}} {{had been}} reorganised {{so that it}} consisted of two field artillery brigades, each of which consisted of three six-gun 18-pounder <b>batteries</b> <b>and</b> twelve 4.5inch howitzers. These brigades were the 7th (consisting of the 25th, 26th, 27th and 107th <b>Batteries)</b> <b>and</b> the 8th (29th, 30th, 31st and 108th Batteries). In April 1917 the division {{was moved to the}} Messines–Wytschaete Ridge section of the line in Belgium, taking up a position on the extreme right of II ANZAC Corps, with the New Zealand Division to its left. It was here, in early June 1917, that the division undertook its first major engagement of the war when it was committed to the fighting during the Battle of Messines. Monash tasked the 9th and 10th Brigades to provide the assault force for the 3rd Division's part of the operation, while the 11th Brigade was to act as the divisional reserve.|$|E
5|$|Fort Ricasoli {{was built}} between 1670 and 1698 {{commanding}} the eastern {{arm of the}} Grand Harbour. It has an irregular plan following the coastline, with bastions, curtains and ravelins.

Fort Saint Angelo was also extensively modified in the 1690s, when it was upgraded with the building of various <b>batteries</b> <b>and</b> other defences.|$|E
5|$|In {{some unusual}} ionic compounds: fast ion conductors, and ionic glasses, {{one or more}} of the ionic {{components}} has a significant mobility, allowing conductivity even while the material as a whole remains solid. This is often highly temperature dependant, and may be the result of either a phase change or a high defect concentration. These materials are used in all solid-state supercapacitors, <b>batteries,</b> <b>and</b> fuel cells, and in various kinds of chemical sensors.|$|E

5|$|The uses {{of carbon}} and its {{compounds}} are extremely varied. It can form alloys with iron, of which the most common is carbon steel. Graphite is combined with clays to form the 'lead' used in pencils used for writing and drawing. It is also used as a lubricant and a pigment, as a molding material in glass manufacture, in electrodes for dry <b>batteries</b> <b>and</b> in electroplating and electroforming, in brushes for electric motors and as a neutron moderator in nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{possible}} sources for natural promethium: rare decays of natural europium-151 (producing promethium-147), and uranium (various isotopes). Practical applications exist only for chemical compounds of promethium-147, {{which are used}} in luminous paint, atomic <b>batteries</b> <b>and</b> thickness measurement devices, even though promethium-145 is the most stable promethium isotope. Because natural promethium is exceedingly scarce, it is typically synthesized by bombarding uranium-235 (enriched uranium) with thermal neutrons to produce promethium-147 as a fission product.|$|E

5|$|Various {{modifications}} {{were made}} to Valletta's fortifications during British rule. The most significant of these was the construction of Fort Lascaris between 1854 and 1856. Other alterations included the addition of <b>batteries</b> <b>and</b> concrete gun emplacements, changes to parapets and their embrasures, {{and the construction of}} gunpowder magazines. All three original Hospitaller gateways to Valletta were demolished, and two of them were replaced by larger gates.|$|E
5|$|A {{detachment}} of the British landing force then {{separated from the}} main body and seized a third battery named laNeuf, routing a force of local militia that attempted to block their advance with artillery assistance from the British squadron in the bay. The militia had come down from their garrisons in the surrounding hills and been joined by 110 French soldiers who had disembarked from Caroline, but the small French force was easily brushed aside by the British landing party. Keating and Willoughby then destroyed the guns {{in the first two}} captured <b>batteries</b> <b>and</b> stormed the remaining two fortifications, once again capturing them and using their own cannon to fire on the shipping in the harbour.|$|E

She continued to serve in a training role at the submarine base on Brioni, but was at Pola {{at the end of}} the war. She was awarded to Italy as a war reparation in 1920 and scrapped at Pola.
