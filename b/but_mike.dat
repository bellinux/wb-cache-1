5|$|In {{the five}} years that take place between seasons four and five, Susan and Mike are {{involved}} in a car crash that kills a mother and her daughter. Although Susan was driving, Mike takes the blame, as Susan did not have her license with her at the time. Susan feels incredibly guilty for taking the lives of Lila (Marie Caldare) and Paige Dash (Madeleine Michelle Dunn), <b>but</b> <b>Mike</b> insists it was not their fault. The argument over the topic becomes so great that it results in divorce. Giving up on love, Susan engages in a casual relationship with her house painter, Jackson Braddock (Gale Harold).|$|E

60|$|This {{was said}} {{with so much}} nature and truth, that the captain had not the heart to repeat the question, though Joyce's more drilled {{feelings}} were less moved. The first even felt a tear springing to his eye, and he no longer distrusted the Irishman's fidelity, as unaccountable as his conduct did and must seem to his cooler judgment. <b>But</b> <b>Mike's</b> sensitiveness had taken the alarm, {{and it was only}} to be appeased by explanations.|$|R
5000|$|Mike panics, {{and calls}} Carrie, and the police. Carrie {{does not believe}} Mike's story, and the 911 {{operator}} is doubtful as well, <b>but</b> promises <b>Mike</b> he will send a unit to his apartment. Back home, Mike's television is on, and is showing Andromeda molesting an unconscious Carrie, and slitting her throat. Mike destroys the DVD and unplugs the television, {{but it will not}} turn off. Andromeda then appears in the room, and seduces Mike, who asks [...] "Do I have to die? I don't want this to end". Andromeda responds with [...] "You're already dead" [...] as it is revealed the two are on Mike's television, and Mike's mutilated body is lying on his couch. The officers called by Mike arrive at his apartment, <b>but</b> <b>Mike's</b> body is gone. Two detectives find Andromeda's DVD and magazine, and take them as evidence.|$|R

25|$|Minnesota scored {{first on}} a 38-yard field goal by Rich Karlis, but then Montana {{completed}} four unanswered scores: a 72-yard {{touchdown pass to}} wide receiver Jerry Rice, an 8-yarder to tight end Brent Jones, an 8-yarder to wide receiver John Taylor, and a 13-yarder to Rice. In the fourth quarter, defensive back Ronnie Lott returned an interception 58 yards for a touchdown, and Tim McKyer's 41-yard interception return set up their final score on Roger Craig's 4-yard run. The 49ers could have had an even bigger lead, <b>but</b> <b>Mike</b> Cofer missed two fields goals from distances of 31 and 32 yards, along with an extra point, while Craig lost an early fumble on the Minnesota 9-yard line.|$|E
25|$|Jacksonville {{was forced}} to punt on their opening drive, and Russell Copeland {{returned}} the ball 16 yards to the Jags 43-yard line, setting up Kelly's 7-yard touchdown pass to running back Thurman Thomas. But later in the quarter, Jacksonville defensive end Clyde Simmons intercepted a shovel pass intended for Thomas and returned it 20 {{yards for a touchdown}} to tie the game. Buffalo stormed right back with a 10-play, 68-yard drive that ended with Thomas' 2-yard touchdown run, making the score 14–7. However, Jacksonville running back Natrone Means' 62-yard carry on their next drive moved the ball to the Bills 5-yard line.

Aware of his need for a study group, Abe invited Mike to join his, where Mike met Grant Linowitz, Deirdre Bennett, and Peter Balcovske. At first, Mike got off to a bad start with the group with his apparent lack of preparation, and nervous habit of clowning around. <b>But</b> <b>Mike's</b> medical skill was soon made evident when he quickly came to the aid of Belkovske, the study group leader, who was having an epileptic attack and eventually dropped out of medical school.|$|R
25|$|In the 2001 draft, the Twins also {{selected}} Joe's {{older brother}} Jake as the 677th overall {{pick in the}} 23rd round. Jake played at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul. Some observers concluded {{that this was an}} attempt to induce Joe to sign a contract, <b>but</b> <b>Mike</b> Radcliff, the scouting director of the Twins, denied this. Jake Mauer ended his playing career after the 2005 season but went on to manage the Gulf Coast League Twins (Rookie Level). After winning the GCL South with the Twins in 2009, Jake moved up to the High-A Fort Myers Miracle and managed the team for two seasons. Following the Twins' agreement to add the Cedar Rapids Kernels as the team's Low-A affiliate in November 2012, Mauer was named the team's manager.|$|E
25|$|Gloucestershire Gladiators crashed {{back into}} the relegation zone with a defeat against Glamorgan Dragons at Sophia Gardens, succumbing to medium pace bowler David Harrison, who bowled four maiden overs to end with bowling figures of 9-4-16-2. Despite half-centuries from Kabir Ali and Alex Gidman, who looked to give the {{visitors}} a comfortable target after moving to 103 for 3, Dean Cosker ripped out three quick wickets, and Gidman was forced to consolidate. He did top score with 62, but Glamorgan were set a rather modest target of 195 to win. Jon Lewis made inroads with his medium pace early on, taking three wickets as Glamorgan stuttered to 40 for 4, <b>but</b> <b>Mike</b> Powell and Dan Cherry put Glamorgan back in it with a 79-run stand, and Gloucestershire's bowlers were made to rue their 15 wides, as they helped Glamorgan to reach their target with two overs remaining.|$|E

He produced two recordings with Eden Records, [...] "Grace (and Other Stuff)" [...] and [...] "Life With a View." [...] <b>But</b> <b>Mike’s</b> first musical love has been children’s music—or as Mike calls it, “family music.” He incorporated his “family music” {{in all of}} his gospel concerts until soon those songs became his most requested. Concert-goers were disappointed when those fun, zany songs were not available on CDs or cassettes.

25|$|When Mickey visits {{his sister}} Dawn in France in 2005, he was {{surprised}} to discover that she is living with their biological father, Mike. Mickey is unimpressed with his father's sudden return; he refuses to forgive Mike for his prior neglect, and they fight when Mike makes derogatory comments about Rosie. Mike tries to make excuses for his absence, but Mickey refuses to believe him. They eventually call an uneasy truce, <b>but</b> <b>Mike</b> alienates his son further when he tries to con his friend Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi) out of his life savings. Mickey enters into a relationship with Li Chong (Elizabeth Tan) in 2007, and they eventually both move into Gus Smith's (Mohammed George) flat. Li often tests the relationship, infuriating Mickey by growing cannabis in their closet, and then involving him in a money-making scam by advertising him as a male escort without his consent. With persuasion, Mickey agrees to do the male escorting, but Li proves too jealous of his flirtations with other women, so their scam soon ends. Li abruptly ends the relationship when Mickey starts getting too serious for her.|$|E

The maps were commended by some, being called [...] "useful right out of the box" [...] <b>but</b> <b>Mike</b> MacKenzie, of RPGnet, said they were [...] "basically a Book of Lairs for undead. Nothing terribly remarkable here." [...] The section includes statistics and back-stories for alternatives classic undead monsters, including ten different ghosts, six liches, 19 skeletons, ten vampires, and fifteen zombies.|$|E
500|$|According to Charles' autobiography, [...] "What'd I Say" [...] was {{accidental}} when he improvised it to {{fill time}} {{at the end of}} a concert in December 1958. He asserts that he never tested songs on audiences before recording them, but [...] "What'd I Say" [...] is an exception. Charles himself does not recall where the concert took place, <b>but</b> <b>Mike</b> Evans in Ray Charles: The Birth of Soul places the show in Brownsville, Pennsylvania. Shows were played at [...] "meal dances" [...] which typically ran four hours with a half-hour break, and would end around 1 or 2 in the morning. Charles and his orchestra had exhausted their set list after midnight, but had 12 minutes left to fill. He told the Raelettes, [...] "Listen, I'm going to fool around and y'all just follow me".|$|E

500|$|Wanting {{to prove}} himself, Mike enters the university's [...] "Scare Games", {{and makes a}} wager with Hardscrabble to {{reinstate}} him and his team to the scare program if they win, <b>but</b> <b>Mike</b> must leave the university if they lose. He joins a group of misfits named Oozma Kappa, the weakest fraternity on campus, but they are denied entry to the Games for being one team member short. Sulley subsequently joins them, seeing the competition as his ticket back into the scare program. Oozma Kappa finish last in the first challenge, but are saved from elimination after another team is disqualified for cheating. Oozma Kappa improve gradually due to Mike's training, intricate knowledge of scaring, and they advance through each following challenge, finishing just behind competition favorites, Roar Omega Roar. In the final round, they defeat Roar Omega Roar with a decisive final scare by Mike in the simulation bedroom. However, Mike soon discovers that he only won because Sulley changed the machine's difficulty to the easiest setting.|$|E
500|$|When they smuggle {{her back}} into the factory {{disguised}} as a baby monster in an attempt to send her home, Randall discovers her and tries to kidnap her, but he mistakenly kidnaps Mike instead. He straps Mike to a large machine called [...] "The Scream Extractor," [...] which he intends to use to revolutionize the scaring industry and solve the monster world's energy problems by forcefully extracting screams from kidnapped human children. Before Randall can use the machine on Mike, Sulley intervenes and reports Randall to Waternoose. Waternoose, secretly in league with Randall, instead exiles Mike and Sulley to the Himalayas. The two are taken in by a Yeti, who tells them about a nearby village which Sulley realizes he can use to return to the factory. Sulley prepares to leave, <b>but</b> <b>Mike</b> refuses to go with him. Meanwhile, Randall is preparing to use the Scream Extractor on Boo, but Sulley arrives and saves her. Randall and Sulley fight, and after Mike returns and the two reconcile, they overpower Randall, take Boo, and flee.|$|E
500|$|Throughout 1969 and 1970, Cooper and Senator Frank Church co-sponsored the Cooper–Church Amendments, {{aimed at}} curbing further {{escalation}} of the Vietnam War. Congressional approval {{of one of these}} amendments on December 15, 1969, de-funded the use of U.S. troops in Laos and Thailand. Cooper had wanted to include a restriction on forces entering Cambodia as well, <b>but</b> <b>Mike</b> Mansfield, who helped Cooper write the amendment, feared that Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was officially neutral in the conflict, might be offended. When Sihanouk was deposed in 1970, Cambodia's new leader, Lon Nol, appealed to President Nixon for help in stabilizing his rule. Nixon agreed to send troops to Cambodia, despite protests from Cooper and others that this violated his stated goal of de-escalation in the region. Cooper and Church then drafted another amendment to de-fund U.S. operations in Cambodia; after negotiations with Nixon that continued funding until July 1970 so that the troops already in the country could be evacuated, the amendment passed 58–37. The House of Representatives later stripped the amendment from the legislation to which it was attached, and it did not go into effect. The amendment was nevertheless hailed by The Washington Post as [...] "the first time in our history that Congress has attempted to limit the deployment of American troops in the course of an ongoing war." [...] The fight over the Cooper–Church Amendments took its toll on Cooper's health, and he was briefly hospitalized to regain his strength. In 1971, Church, Mansfield, and George Aiken convinced Cooper to help them write an amendment to end U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia altogether, but ultimately, the measure did not have the support to pass and was abandoned.|$|E

50|$|To help Mike recover, Trent coaxes {{him into}} an impromptu trip to Las Vegas. Trent succeeds in picking up two waitresses, <b>but</b> <b>Mike's</b> {{obsession}} with Michelle ruins Trent's plans. Back in Los Angeles, Mike, Rob and other friends go bar hopping, stopping at party, and later an after-hours spot, where Trent demonstrates his prowess in handling the opposite sex. Inspired by this, Mike meets a girl named Nikki and gets her phone number. Back at his apartment, however, he leaves a series of increasingly anxious and desperate messages on her answering machine until she calls back and disgustedly orders him not to call her again. Missing Michelle more than ever, he contemplates moving back to New York until Rob comes over and consoles him.|$|R
2500|$|Minnesota {{finally managed}} to get rolling in the second quarter, with a 50-yard {{completion}} from Tarkenton to running back Oscar Reed setting up Fred Cox's 19-yard field goal. But with 3:30 left in the half, Vikings defensive back Bobby Bryant fumbled a punt return that was recovered by Redskins running back Bob Brunet on the Minnesota 21-yard line. [...] Billy Kilmer then completed a 17-yard pass to Charley Taylor before Larry Brown scored on a 3-yard touchdown run to give the Redskins a 7–3 lead.

2500|$|Upon {{reaching}} his hundred, Sehwag did not {{do anything}} excessive, by his standards, instead, lofted MacGill for six and then continued his belligerent display by hitting Brad Williams for two fours and then, in the last over before tea, which was bowled by Waugh, Sehwag clubbed a six to move to 130 from 170 balls, complete with nineteen boundaries and two sixes. Australia were distinctly unlucky, as Sehwag's knock could have been nipped in the bud, {{had it not been}} for the missed run-out chance and a dropped catch when he was on 66. <b>But</b> <b>Mike</b> Coward, writing for Wisden's test match report commented on the aggressiveness in Sehwag's innings.

2500|$|Colts {{returner}} Jim Duncan fumbled {{the opening}} kickoff {{of the second}} half and Dallas recovered. Then the Cowboys drove to the Colts' 1-yard line, <b>but</b> <b>Mike</b> Curtis punched the ball loose from Cowboys running back Duane Thomas before crossing the end zone, and the Colts took over at the 1 as Duncan was credited with the recovery–-a controversial call because when the resulting pile-up was sorted out, Dallas center Dave Manders was holding the ball. The energized Colts then drove to the Cowboys' 44-yard line but came up empty when O'Brien's 52-yard field goal attempt fell short of the goal posts. However, instead of attempting to return the missed field goal, Renfro allowed it to bounce inside their own 1-yard line where it was downed by center Tom Goode (NFL rules prior to 1974 allowed a field goal that fell short of the goal posts to be downed just like a punt; that rule is still in effect in high school football). [...] "I thought it would carry into the end zone", Renfro explained after the game.|$|E
