Although various human cell types may have the same genome, these cells have different methylomes. The systematic identification and characterization of methylation marks across cell types are crucial to understanding the complex regulatory network for cell fate determination. Hongbo Liu et al. proposed an entropy-based framework termed SMART to integrate the whole genome <b>bisulfite</b> <b>sequencing</b> methylomes across 42 human tissues/cells and identified 757,887 genome segments. Nearly 75% of the segments showed uniform methylation across all cell types. From the remaining 25% of the segments, they identified cell type-specific hypo/hypermethylation marks that were specifically hypo/hypermethylated in a minority of cell types using a statistical approach and presented an atlas of the human methylation marks. Further analysis revealed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks were enriched through H3K27ac and transcription factor binding sites in cell type-specific manner.

The function of body methylation is not known, {{but it may}} either prevent aberrant expression from intragenic promoters or enhance the accuracy of splicing.

To test these hypotheses, we reanalyzed single-base resolution <b>bisulfite</b> <b>sequence</b> data from Arabidopsis thaliana to differentiate body-methylated genes from unmethylated genes using a probabilistic approach. Contrasting genic characteristics between the two groups, we found that body-methylated genes tend to be longer and to be more functionally important, as measured by phenotypic effects of insertional mutants and by gene expression, than unmethylated genes. We also found that methylated genes evolve more slowly than unmethylated genes, despite the potential for increased mutation rates in methylated CpG dinucleotides. We propose that slower rates in body-methylated genes are a function of higher selective constraint, lower nucleosome occupancy, and a lower proportion of CpG dinucleotides...|$|R

Therefore, the longer the desired PCR amplicon, the more limited the number of intact template molecules will likely be. This could lead to the failure of the PCR amplification, or the loss of quantitatively accurate information on methylation levels resulting from the limited sampling of template molecules.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported loss of expression of p 27 Kip 1 (p 27) protein in rat GH 3 and mouse GHRH-CL 1 pituitary tumor cells compared with normal pituitary (NP). The molecular {{basis for the}} loss of expression of p 27 protein in GH 3 and GHRH-CL 1 cells is unknown. To determine the role of p 27 gene methylation in the regulation of the expression of this cell cycle protein, the methylation patterns of p 27 in normal and neoplastic pituitary cells was analyzed. Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase (DNA-MTase) with 5 -aza- 2 ′-deoxycytidine (AZAdC) induced expression of both p 27 protein and mRNA when GH 3 and GHRH-CL 1 cells were treated for 7 days in vitro. DNA methylation correlated inversely with the expression of p 27 gene products in NP and pituitary tumor cell lines. <b>Bisulfite</b> genomic <b>sequencing</b> analysis showed that the normally unmethylated cytosines in exon 1 in NP and AtT 20 cells were extensively methylated in GH 3 and GHRH-CL 1 cells. After treatment of GH 3 and GHRH-CL 1 cells with 10 μmol/L AZAdC, there were decreased numbers of methylated cytosines (by 60 % to 90 %) with variable methylation patterns observed by <b>bisulfite</b> genomic <b>sequencing.</b> Analysis of genomic DNA with methylation-sensitive enzymes showed that all SmaI, HhaI, and AvaI enzyme sites of the p 27 gene in exon 1 were methylated in GH 3 cells but not in NP, confirming the <b>bisulfite</b> genomic <b>sequencing</b> results. AtT 20 cells and a human pituitary null cell adenoma cell line (HP 75), which expressed abundant p 27, had a methylation pattern similar to the NP. DNA-MTase activity was elevated fourfold in GH 3 cells and twofold in GHRH-CL 1 cells compared with DNA-MTase activity in NP and AtT 20 cells.

To date, however, the evidence from plant systems is mixed as to whether patterns of DNA methylation vary significantly among tissues and, if so, whether these differences affect tissue-specific gene expression. To address these questions, we analyzed both <b>bisulfite</b> <b>sequence</b> (BSseq) and transcriptomic sequence data from three biological replicates of two tissues (leaf and floral bud) from the model grass species Brachypodium distachyon. Our first goal was to determine whether tissues were more differentiated in DNA methylation than explained by variation among biological replicates. Tissues were more differentiated than biological replicates, but the analysis of replicated data revealed high (> 50 %) false positive rates for the inference of differentially methylated sites (DMSs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Comparing methylation to gene expression, we found that differential CG methylation consistently covaried negatively with gene expression, regardless as to whether methylation was within genes, within their promoters or even within their closest transposable element. The relationship between gene expression and either CHG or CHH methylation was less consistent.

However, the mechanistic links between genetic variation and methylation remain unclear. To begin addressing this gap, we collected methylation data at ∼ 300, 000 loci in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 64 HapMap Yoruba individuals, and genome-wide <b>bisulfite</b> <b>sequence</b> data in ten of these individuals. We identified (at an FDR of 10 %) 13, 915 cis methylation QTLs (meQTLs) -i. e., CpG sites in which changes in DNA methylation are associated with genetic variation at proximal loci. We found that meQTLs are frequently associated with changes in methylation at multiple CpGs across regions of up to 3 kb. Interestingly, meQTLs are also frequently associated with variation in other properties of gene regulation, including histone modifications, DNase I accessibility, chromatin accessibility, and expression levels of nearby genes. These observations suggest that genetic variants may lead to coordinated molecular changes {{in all of these}} regulatory phenotypes.

Results: Among the 28 H. pylori - infected subjects (median age, 44. 5 years), 15 (53. 6 %) had E-cadherin methylation detected in stomach at baseline. Discordant methylation patterns between the antrum and corpus were noted in six patients.
