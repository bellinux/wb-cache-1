40|$|The Opd Unit of the Pogonip Group is a slope-forming {{carbonate}} {{sequence that}} crops {{out in the}} Arrow Canyon Range 75 miles north of Las Vegas, Nevada. It is composed mainly of grainstones, packstones, and intraformational conglomerates and also contains Calathium-bearing bioherms composed dominantly of wackestones. These rocks were deposited in a shallow-water, high-energy, subtidal, tropical marine environment. Nuia and Nuia-crinoid shoals developed on this shallow ramp and the area was frequently disturbed by storms. Calathium-dominated carbonate mudmounds emerged on the Nuia and Nuia-crinoid shoals. Although Calathium dominated the mounds on a macroscopic scale, the mounds were build by unpreserved microorganisms. Calathium simply lived in the mounds and may have acted as sediment <b>bafflers.</b> Other mound dwellers included trilobites, crinoids, gastropods, nautiloids, brachiopods, and bryozoa. The bioherms of the Opd Unit represent the transition from bioconstructions dominated by microorganisms during the Middle and Late Cambrian to those dominated by sessile benthonic macroorganisms during the Middle Ordovician...|$|R

40|$|Seagrass {{habitats}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} productive ecosystems in the biosphere. They serve as soil stabilizers, wave <b>bafflers,</b> nutrient cyclers, food source, protection, nursery habitat for fauna, and habitat for epiphytic flora. Impacts on seagrass beds from human disturbances, such as boating and coastal development, are becoming more prevalent as urban coastal areas grow in population. As populations increase in these areas, so does the use of the shallow coastal waters where seagrass grow. Mechanical disturbances, such as those from boat propellers, anchoring, mooring buoys, trawling and dredging, all disrupt or remove seagrass vegetation from their locations. Impacts such as habitat fragmentation, which decrease the size of once continuous beds and increase the perimeter (edge) of patches, can have differing effects on the fauna that utilize seagrass beds. Consequently, epifauna, infauna and nekton have varying responses to changes in the landscape structure of seagrass beds. Conservation and management may be necessary to slow and prevent anthropogenic causes of habitat alteration...|$|R
40|$|Bivalve {{molluscs}} show a {{short and}} peculiar Early Jurassic evolutionary phase {{characterized by the}} Lithiotis sensu lato fauna, mainly represented by the three monospecific genera Lithiotis, Cochlearites and Lithioperna. These bivalves with stick-like or flattened large shells are mostly restricted to the Pliensbachian. They have a wide geographical distribution, occurring both in Tethyan and Panthalassian carbonate platforms, where considerable biogenic accumulations formed. They were common on the Trento Platform (Southern Alps), where they occur in the Rotzo Formation (Calcari Grigi Group). This formation was deposited in a tropical lagoon which was closed seawards by oolitic shoals and bars and bordered landwards by marshes. The Lithiotis s. l. fauna of the Trento Platform seems to be restricted to the upper Pliensbachian. It appeared after a eutrophic phasewith recurrent lowoxygen and brackish conditions and flourished in meso- to oligotrophic waters. The stratigraphic and geographic distributions of each genus are compared to the environmental development of the Rotzo Formation in order to highlight limiting environmental factors and ecological requirements. Lithioperna occurs throughout the whole formation; {{it is the most}} eurytopic genus, well adapted to dysaerobic habitats and with higher ecomorphic plasticity than the other two genera. It frequently occurs in the life position, giving rise to densely packed fan-like or book-like aggregates. Lithiotis required aerobic and euhaline marine conditions and is common in the middle part of the formation where mesotrophic conditions prevailed. This genus is rarely preserved in the theoretical vertical life position probably due to lower shell stability and a less effective attachment modality. Cochlearites is the most common genus of the Rotzo Formation. This genus inhabited euhaline to slightly hypersaline marine environments occurring in {{the upper part of the}} formation, prevailing in oligotrophic conditions. Lithiotis s. l. fauna gave rise to biogenic accumulations with an elevation of a few decimeters to several meters above the sea-bottom and with a lateral extension ranging from ten to several hundred meters. Therefore, these accumulations represent biological build-ups, which document four developmental phases: colonization, aggradation, progradation and demise. The colonization phase is represented by pioneering individuals which were cemented or byssally attached to a bioclastic, coarse-grained stormlayer, which constituted the hard substrate for larval attachment. The aggradation phase produced the core of the build-up and its elevation above the sea-bottom. The core ismostly represented by individuals which acted as <b>bafflers,</b> commonlywith an apparently chaotic fabric. The Lithiotis s. s. and Cochlearites cores are generallymud-supported and contain loosely packed to dispersed specimens, occasionally preserved in life position. The Lithiotis s. s. andCochlearites build-ups can be defined as bivalve mounds. The cores of the Lithioperna build-ups are skeletal-supported with shells mostly preserved in life position, which characterize the bivalve reefs. The prograding phase produced lateral additions to the build-up flanks of oblique and imbricated articulated individuals. The flanks grew centrifugally from the core and represent the most conspicuous part of the build-ups, ranging from 10 to 20 times the size of the core and occasionally extending over several hundred meters...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{different}} sensory modalities that {{play a role}} in sexual selection, acoustic communication plays an important one. Acoustic communication has been known to be used for male-male competition (territory maintenance, male aggression during mating),for advertisement to the opposite sex (mating status, body condition, genetic quality, nutritional status) and used by females to sample and choose conspecific preferred males. The use of acoustic communication for sexual display and information exchange has been extensively studied in multiple taxa, including insects, anurans, birds and mammals. Among insects, crickets have proven to be good model systems to study sexual selection based on acoustic communication as most species have an elaborate acoustic communication system, male advertisements, diverse types of mating incentives for females (such as glandular feeding) and a female dominated mating system. Generally, in crickets males produce species-specific calls which are used by females to localize conspecific males. Besides, calls show high levels of intraspecific variation and are energetically costly to produce. Moreover, as in crickets predominantly the females show phonotaxis towards male calls, calls also can {{play a role in}} mate sampling and choice by acting as indicators of preferred male quality. Despite being studied for many decades there are certain gaps in the studies examining mate choice in crickets. Some of them are, lack of understanding of the variation of male calling traits in nature and its role in signal evolution, lack of understanding regarding the ecological context of mate sampling and the evolution of alternative mating strategies. Hence, the tree cricket Oecanthus henryi was chosen as a study system to address these gaps in the understanding of female choice based on acoustic signals. In the tree cricket Oecanthus henryi, males call and females use calls to localize conspecific males and hence potentially females can choose males based on acoustic cues. To understand the evolution of female preference for male acoustic cues {{it is important to understand}} the variation in the calling songs in the field and identify repeatable call features that are reliable indicators of preferred male traits (morphological, developmental or genetic). I measured repeatability of male call traits in the field to understand their variation, reliability and consistency. Carrier frequency was the only call trait that was highly repeatable and hence was reliable and consistent. Following this I examined whether any of these call traits were indicators of male morphological traits (such as male size and fluctuating asymmetry) which are known to be preferred by females. It was found that carrier frequency was negatively correlated with body size; hence carrier frequency was both reliable and indicated male size. I also found that females preferred larger males during mating, as revealed by the longer mating durations and longer spermatophore retention time. Interestingly, though this study indicated that females could in principle use lower call carrier frequency to localize preferred larger males, simultaneous choice experiments done in the laboratory revealed that the females do not use this cue. These contrasting results may be because females are incapable of discriminating small differences in frequency or because they use non-acoustic cues for mate choice. However, whichever cues the females use to discriminate between males in the laboratory conditions, often these preferences are not realized in the field. The main reason behind this is that searching for preferred mates in the field can be costly and this might force females to choose sub-optimal males. Theoretical models predict that male movement and spacing in the field should influence female sampling tactics and in turn, females should drive the evolution of male movement and spacing to sample them optimally. Moreover, simultaneous sampling of males using the best-of-n or comparative Bayes strategy should yield maximum mating benefits to females. Many of the theoretical mate sampling strategies involves recall of the quality and location of individual males, which in turn requires male positions to be stable within a night. Calling males of O. henryi showed high site fidelity within a night, potentially enabling female sampling strategies that require recall. To examine the possibility of simultaneous acoustic sampling of males, I estimated male acoustic active spaces using information on male spacing, call transmission and female phonotactic threshold. Males were found to be spaced far apart and active space overlap was rare. I then examined female sampling scenarios by studying female spacing relative to male acoustic active spaces. Only 15 % of sampled females could hear multiple males, suggesting that simultaneous mate sampling is rare in the field. Moreover, the relatively large distances between calling males suggest high search costs, which may favor threshold strategies that do not require memory. Using the insights gathered from these two studies I examined a unique calling behaviour from leaf holes, baffling, observed in this species. Baffling behaviour has been found in multiple species of the genus Oecanthus where the males call from selfmade holes in leaves rather than calling from leaf edges (their natural calling surface) thus increasing their loudness many fold. I started by examining the natural history of baffling and found that baffling is an extremely rare behaviour in the field. However field observations and laboratory experiments revealed that many males can baffle and hence it is not an obligatory behaviour shown only by a few males. It was hypothesized that one reason for the rarity of baffling could be resource limitation. It was found that baffling males prefer larger leaves possibly due to higher SPL gains achieved by baffling on the larger leaves, which is a limited resource in the field. However this alone was insufficient to explain extreme rarity of <b>bafflers</b> in the field. Hence I examined which males were using this behaviour in the field. Using field observations and laboratory experiments it was found that less preferred males (smaller and quieter) baffled more which provided them with higher calling SPL and greater sound-field volume and thus a higher number of potential mates. Moreover, baffling also increased the mating duration for the less preferred males thus providing more time to these males for sperm transfer. The females could not differentiate between an inherently loud caller and a caller whose SPL was increased artificially (as if it was baffling). Hence I concluded that baffling is probably a cheater strategy used by the less preferred males to fool the females into approaching them and mating for longer durations. To my knowledge, this is the first study that has estimated male call variation in the field to understand its role in female choice in tree crickets. Moreover this is also the first study to examine the ecological context of mate choice in tree crickets. This is also the first study to examine the advantages of baffling behaviour and its potential evolutionary implications. {{the different}} sensory modalities that play a role in sexual selection, acoustic communication plays an important one.
