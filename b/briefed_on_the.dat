5|$|On 22 May 1944, the 500th SS Parachute Battalion {{were transported}} to airfields at Nagy-Betskerek, Zagreb and Banja Luka, dressed in Wehrmacht uniforms for {{security}} reasons. However, {{the troops were}} not <b>briefed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> operation until {{a few hours before}} it was launched. They then linked up with their transport aircraft, including the ten-man gliders that would deliver the glider-borne troops onto their objectives. By 24 May, all preparations for the airborne assault were complete.|$|E
5|$|After {{five days}} and {{multiple}} attempts to rescue Hambleton, five aircraft {{had been shot}} down and another 16 seriously damaged, 10 service members had been killed or were missing in action, two were POWs, and two were behind front lines also waiting to be rescued. On April 8, Gen. Creighton Abrams was <b>briefed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high losses in the several failed attempts to rescue Hambleton and Clark. He ordered that no further air CSAR would be attempted, but that given Hambleton's Top Secret clearance and knowledge of missiles and counter-measure technology, that every effort {{should be made to}} bring him out.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} in Saigon on 13 March President Thiệu was <b>briefed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} situation by Trưởng and the new III Corps commander, Lieutenant General Nguyễn Văn Toàn. Thiệu then laid out his plan for national consolidation. As Trưởng understood it, {{he was free to}} redeploy his forces to hold the Da Nang area. Trưởng was shocked to discover, however, that the Airborne Division was to be removed to III Corps (unknown to Trưởng at the time, the Marine Division was also already slated for redeployment with both units then forming a new national reserve).|$|E

5|$|Captain Joseph Miceli, {{assigned}} by the Navy to lead the technical investigation into the explosion, had supervised the preparation of powder and shells used in Iowa's 16-inch guns. Thus, according to Thompson, Miceli had {{a conflict of interest}} in ensuring that the powder, ammunition, or guns were not at fault in the explosion. After being <b>briefed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NIS's focus on Hartwig, Miceli directed his investigative team to determine how Hartwig had initiated the explosion using an electrical or chemical detonator.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} part of the area of operations around Stolac, the situation was significantly calmer than around Nevesinje, although a group of 200 Ustaše at Berkovići were falsely claiming that they were being surrounded by rebels at night. Despite this claim, they had suffered no casualties. Regardless, Prpić sent them ammunition and a platoon of the 18th Battalion. At 19:00 on 26 June, Francetić arrived at Prpić's headquarters in Mostar to be <b>briefed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> situation. He resolved that he would travel to Berkovići the following day and take personal command of the Ustaše unit there.|$|E

Many of the soldiers had not slept for two nights, but the successful crossing was a morale booster, a tonic as he described it.|$|E

5|$|After the Spartans' first {{successful}} operation, John-117 is <b>briefed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{threat posed by}} the Covenant, a theocratic alliance of alien races, and witnesses the utter devastation wrought by a single ship. In 2552, the Chief and Spartans return to Reach, where the UNSC High Command has developed a last-ditch plan to capture a Covenant High Prophet, who they hope {{could be used in}} order to barter a truce. The Master Chief's armor is upgraded, and he first encounters the artificial intelligence (AI) Cortana during a training mission. The Covenant arrive and invade, despite the best efforts of the Spartans and other UNSC forces. Aboard the spaceship Pillar of Autumn, Cortana plots a random course of escape. Seemingly the last Spartan alive, the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep along with the Pillar of Autumns crew.|$|E
5|$|Although the Vice President Henry A. Wallace {{had been}} {{involved}} in the Manhattan Project since the beginning, his successor, Harry S. Truman, was not <b>briefed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> project by Stimson until April 23, 1945, eleven days after he became president on Roosevelt's death on April 12, 1945. On May 2, 1945, Truman approved the formation of the Interim Committee, an advisory group that would report on the atomic bomb. It consisted of Stimson, James F. Byrnes, George L. Harrison, Vannevar Bush, James Bryant Conant, Karl Taylor Compton, William L. Clayton, and Ralph Austin Bard, advised by scientists Robert Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi, Ernest Lawrence, and Arthur Compton. In a June 1 report, the Committee concluded that the bomb should be used as soon as possible against a war plant surrounded by workers' homes and that no warning or demonstration should be given.|$|E
5|$|Following her election, Collins {{donated the}} surplus $242,000 from her {{campaign}} coffers {{to the state}} Democratic Party. When Collins' husband was named state treasurer for the party– at an annual salary of $59,900– the state press charged that the move was a plot to funnel Collins' campaign funds into her personal account. (The previous Democratic state treasurer had received no salary during his tenure.) Following the media criticism, Dr. Collins resigned his post as treasurer. All of the involved individuals insisted that Governor Collins had not been <b>briefed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> details of her husband's appointment. The media's criticism of Collins continued {{as many of the}} appointments to her executive cabinet went to what they characterized as inexperienced personnel who had held key positions in her past campaigns. When newly appointed Insurance Commissioner Gilbert McCarty approved a 17% rate increase requested by Blue Cross Blue Shield– a request that his predecessor had denied a few days earlier– Collins quickly countermanded the approval pending a public hearing on the matter.|$|E

5|$|The Fleet Air Arm units {{selected}} for Operation Tungsten conducted intensive training from February 1944. A {{high proportion of}} the airmen were inexperienced, and the captain of Victorious estimated that 85 per cent of the aircrew embarked on his ship had not previously operated at sea. The training program was centred on Loch Eriboll in northern Scotland which, like Kaafjord, was surrounded by steep hills. Flying from RNAS Hatston in the Orkney Islands, the aircrew practised manoeuvring around this terrain to familiarise themselves with the tactics needed to avoid German anti-aircraft guns and successfully attack Tirpitz. The Royal Navy drew on intelligence on the defences of Kaafjord to make the exercise range as similar to the conditions around Tirpitz as was possible, and the aircrew were extensively <b>briefed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> locations of German positions. An {{area the size of}} the battleship was also marked out on an island in the centre of the loch and repeatedly bombed.|$|E
5|$|Upon hearing this, the Combined Fleet commanders relented and {{accepted}} the proposed plan. The ship's crews were <b>briefed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nature of the mission and {{given the opportunity to}} stay behind if desired — none did. However, approximately 80 crew members who were new, sick, or infirm, were ordered off the ships, including sixty-seven naval cadets of Etajima Naval Academy Class No. 74 who had arrived on the battleship three days earlier. The ships' crews now engaged in some last-minute intense drills to prepare for the mission, mostly practicing damage-control procedures. At midnight, the ships were fueled. Reportedly, in secret defiance of orders to provide the ships with only just enough fuel to reach Okinawa, the Tokuyama personnel actually gave Yamato and the other ships almost all of the remaining fuel in the port, although this probably still was not enough to allow the force to return to Japan from Okinawa. In a ceremonial farewell, officers and enlisted men drank sake together.|$|E
