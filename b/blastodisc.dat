50|$|Similar to mammals, {{fertilization}} of the avian ovum {{occurs in}} the oviduct. From there the <b>blastodisc,</b> a small cluster of cells in the animal pole of the egg, then undergoes discoidal meroblastic cleavage. The blastoderm develops into the epiblast and hypoblast and it is between these layers that the blastocoel will form. The shape and formation of the avian <b>blastodisc</b> differs from amphibian, fish, and echinoderm blastulas, but the overall spatial relationship of the blastocoel remains the same.|$|E

40|$|In birds, {{offspring}} {{sex ratio}} manipulation by mothers is now well established with potentially important consequences for evolution and animal breeding. In most studies on {{primary sex ratio}} of birds, eggs are sexed after incubation {{by the use of}} PCR methods targeted to the sex-linked CHD 1 genes. Sexing of unincubated eggs would be preferred, but as fertile and infertile <b>blastodiscs</b> cannot be distinguished macroscopically, errors could arise from PCR amplifications of parental DNA associated with the vitelline membrane of infertile eggs. In this study, we stained <b>blastodiscs</b> without the vitelline membrane with Hoechst 33342. This allowed unequivocal distinction between fertile and infertile <b>blastodiscs.</b> Fertile <b>blastodiscs</b> contained thousands of fluorescent nuclei, whereas no nuclei were seen in infertile eggs. In addition, after nucleic acid analysis, fertile <b>blastodiscs</b> yielded much stronger chromosomal DNA and CHD 1 -targeted PCR bands on agarose gels compared with infertile <b>blastodiscs.</b> These findings indicate that fertile <b>blastodiscs</b> contain much more embryonic DNA than parental DNA, allowing reliable sexing of the fertile eggs. The differences between fertile and infertile <b>blastodiscs</b> in chromosomal DNA and CHD 1 PCR banding intensities alone could also be used to distinguish fertile from infertile eggs without using Hoechst staining. We conclude that identifying fertile <b>blastodiscs</b> either by Hoechst staining or by analyzing the yield of chromosomal DNA and CHD 1 -PCR products, combined with CHD 1 -targeted PCR amplification, presents an easy and reliable method to sex unincubated eggs...|$|R

Romanoff and Cottrell (1939) have approached the problem {{from the point of view}} of bio-physics.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} culture system {{developed}} {{was capable of}} supporting recently ovulated chicken ova in a viable state for at least 24 hr. Utilizing this system, 8 out of 10 ova obtained from the body cavity or infundibulum of unmated White Leghorn hens, were successfully fertil-ized in vitro. Microscopic examination of the eight fertile <b>blastodiscs</b> revealed that five had proceeded to the blastula state of development during the 24 -hr culture period. The remaining three fertile ova, apparently retarded, had not progressed beyond the early cleavage stage of development. None of 10 ova recovered from unmated hens showed signs of development after culture under the same conditions but without incubation with spermatozoa. These observations afford direct evidence that avian spermatozoa do not require a period of capacitation within the hen’s reproductive tract in order to fertilize ova. Since the recognition by Austin (1951) and Chang (1951) that rabbit spermatozoa require {{a period of time}} within the female tract before they are capable of fertilizing ova, evidence has been presented suggesting a period of capacitation to be essential for the fertilizing spermatozoa in many othe...|$|R

50|$|Most bony {{fish eggs}} are {{referred}} to as telolecithal which means that most of the egg cell cytoplasm is yolk. The yolky end of the egg (the vegetal pole) remains homogenous while the other end (the animal pole) undergoes cell division.

The fish zygote is meroblastic, meaning the early cell divisions are not complete. This type of meroblastic cleavage is called discoidal because only the <b>blastodisc</b> becomes the embryo. In fish, waves of calcium released direct the process of cell division by coordinating the mitotic apparatus with the actin cytoskeleton, propagating cell division along the surface, assists in deepening the cleavage furrow, and finally heals the membrane after separation of blastomeres.|$|E
40|$|Recordings of fish sound {{production}} {{were made}} in Charlotte Harbor, Florida using Long Term Acoustic Recording Systems (LARS) programmed to record 10 seconds of sound every 10 minutes. Results demonstrated a strong circadian pattern in fish sound production that occurred {{within a few hours}} of dusk each evening. Sound production lasted on average 8. 7 hrs each evening during the peak spawning season. LARS were deployed when Hurricane Charley crossed Charlotte Harbor in August, 2004. The hurricane did not inhibit nightly chorusing events of spawning fish. Rather, sound levels produced by spawning fish on the night of and 3 days after the hurricane were higher and lasted longer than any of the 9 days recorded prior to the hurricane. Acoustic time series data recorded at multiple sites in Charlotte Harbor during 2005 revealed changes in the spatial distribution of fish sound production in response to increased freshwater inflow and consequent decreased bottom dissolved oxygen concentrations in early June. Fish sound production decreased rapidly over several days at study sites in the northern portion of the harbor most immediately affected by changes in environmental conditions. Meanwhile, fish sound production increased at the study site furthest seaward where normoxic levels were sustained. By August levels of fresh water inflow decreased substantially, bottom dissolved oxygen levels increased and sound production resumed at sites previously affected by these conditions. Fish sound production began intermittently in February and ended in November. Peak levels were reached by mid-late April / early May and continued throughout the summer time. Seasonal patterns of sound production match the reported spawning periods of estuarine sciaenid species recorded. Black drum sound production was measured in the canal systems of Cape Coral and Punta Gorda, Florida during the 2004 - 2006 spawning seasons. The circadian pattern of sound production was similar to other sciaenids documented in Charlotte Harbor. Seasonal patterns of black drum sound production occurred during October through April and peaked in February. This seasonal period of sound production also matched patterns of black drum reproductive readiness and spawning reported in the literature for the Gulf of Mexico. A hydrophone array was used in the Cape Coral canal system to localize calling black drum and measure source levels and propagation of calls. Source level estimates averaged 165 dBRMS re: 1 muPa SPL (SD= 1. 0) (n = 1, 025). Call energy was concentrated in the fundamental frequency (94 Hz) and first two harmonics (188 Hz and 282 Hz). A square root model best described propagation of the fundamental frequency and first harmonic and a log 10 model best described the second harmonic. Based on the mean RMS source level, signal propagation, background levels, and hearing sensitivity, the communication range of black drum at the study site was estimated at between 33 and 108 meters and was limited by background levels, not auditory sensitivity. The timing and levels of sound production and egg production were compared in black drum. Eggs were collected hourly from 1800 - 0400 by surface plankton tows on two consecutive evenings while black drum sound production was continuously recorded. This sampling effort was conducted five separate times from January through April, 2006. Evidence of the time of spawning was indicated by the collection of <b>blastodiscs</b> (fertilized single cell eggs) or back calculated early cleavage stage eggs. Neither the timing nor the quantity of sound production was positively correlated with egg production on a nightly basis and the greatest densities of eggs were collected on evenings which had the lowest levels of sound production. This may have been due to differences in the fecundity of individual females spawning on the evenings when sampling was conducted...|$|R
50|$|In amniote animal embryology, the epiblast {{is one of}} two {{distinct}} layers arising from the inner cell mass in the mammalian blastocyst or from the <b>blastodisc</b> in reptiles and birds.

Posterior to the node is the primitive pit, where {{the cells of the}} epiblast (the upper layer of embryonic cells) initially begin to invaginate. This invagination expands posteriorly into the primitive groove as the cells layers continue to move into the space between the embryonic cells and the yolk. This differentiates the embryo into the three germ layers - endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. The primitive knot migrates posteriorly as gastrulation proceeds, eventually being absorbed into the tail bud.|$|E

We have studied the effect of Myo 1 inhibitor PClP in 1 - 8 cell Zebrafish embryos. Our results indicate a unique involvement of Myo 1 in early development of Zebrafish embryos. Inhibition of Myo 1 (by PClP) and Myo 2 (by Blebbistatin) lead to arrest in cell division. While Myo 1 isoforms appears to be important for both the formation {{and the maintenance of}} cleavage furrows, Myo 2 is required only for the formation of furrows. We found that the <b>blastodisc</b> of the embryo, which contains a thick actin cortex (~ 13 μm), is loaded with cortical Myo 1. Myo 1 appears to be crucial for maintaining the <b>blastodisc</b> morphology and the actin cortex thickness. In addition to cell division and furrow formation, inhibition of Myo 1 has a drastic effect on the dynamics and distribution of lipid droplets (LDs) in the <b>blastodisc</b> near the cleavage furrow. All these results above are effects of Myo 1 inhibition exclusively; Myo 2 inhibition by blebbistatin does not show such phenotypes. Therefore, our results demonstrate a potential role for Myo 1 in the maintenance and formation of furrow, <b>blastodisc</b> morphology, cell-division and LD organization within the <b>blastodisc</b> during early embryogenesis...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: FGF 8 {{has been}} implicated in the {{transfer}} of left-right (L-R) asymmetry from the embryonic midline (node) to the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM). Surprisingly, opposite roles have been described in chick and mouse. In mouse, FGF 8 {{is required for the}} left-asymmetric expression of nodal, lefty 2, and Pitx 2. In chick, FGF 8 represses nodal and Pitx 2 on the right side. This discrepancy could reflect evolutionary differences between birds and mammals. Alternatively, the right-asymmetric expression of fgf 8, which is not found in mouse, at the chick node may be a prerequisite of right-sided function. Finally, chick (<b>blastodisc)</b> and mouse (egg cylinder) differ with respect to the topology of the early gastrula/neurula embryo. Results: The rabbit <b>blastodisc</b> was investigated as an additional mammalian L-R model system. While nodal, lefty, and Pitx 2 showed asymmetric expression in the left LPM, fgf 8 and all other midline marker genes were symmetrically expressed at the node like in mouse. Left-sided application of FGF 8 repressed the endogenous transcription of nodal as well as ectopic expression induced by the parallel administration of BMP 4. Right-sided inhibition of FGF 8 signaling induced bilateral marker gene expression, demonstrating that, in rabbit, FGF 8 acts as a right determinant like in chick. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the anatomy of the early embryo (<b>blastodisc</b> versus egg cylinder) rather than taxonomical differences or asymmetry in expression constitutes an important determinant of FGF 8 function in L-R axis formation. The rabbit may provide a useful model for early human embryogenesis, as human embryos develop via a <b>blastodisc</b> as well...|$|E
40|$|We report {{evidence}} to suggest that during the first few meroblastic cell divisions in zebrafish embryos a dynamic population of central-spindle microtubules serve a crucial function in positioning the cleavage furrow at the surface of the blastoderm. Originating from the mid-zone of the mitotic spindle they develop into what we term a mid-spindle `pre-furrowing microtubule array' that expands upward and outward from the spindle mid-zone towards the <b>blastodisc</b> surface. We suggest that this structure transmits positional information to the <b>blastodisc</b> cortex that results in the correctly positioned assembly of the cytokinetic contractile apparatus. We also propose that the pre-furrowing microtubule array then develops into a furrow-ingression microtubule array that helps direct and assemble the deepening furrow as it cuts its way through the <b>blastodisc.</b> Due to the location of its origin, the pre-furrowing microtubule array serves to successfully separate the daughter nuclei and thus equally divide the blastoderm. Furthermore, co-localization with elements of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum and their inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate receptors suggests that the pre-furrowing microtubule array may also play a role in organizing localized Ca 2 + transients that {{have been shown to be}} essential to the furrow positioning, propagation and deepening process during cytokinesis in zebrafish embryos...|$|E
40|$|We {{report that}} the first {{localized}} Ca 2 + transient visualized in the <b>blastodisc</b> cortex of post-mitotic zebrafish zygotes has unique features. We confirm that this initial `furrow positioning' Ca 2 + transient precedes the physical appearance of the first cleavage furrow at the <b>blastodisc</b> surface {{and that it has}} unique dynamics, which distinguish it from the subsequent furrow propagation transients that develop from it. This initial transient displays a distinct rising phase that peaks prior to the initiation of the two linear, subsurface, self-propagating Ca 2 + waves that constitute the subsequent furrow propagation transient. Through the carefully timed introduction of the Ca 2 + buffer, dibromo-BAPTA, we also demonstrate the absolute requirement of this initial rising phase Ca 2 + transient in positioning the furrow at the <b>blastodisc</b> surface: no rising phase transient, no cleavage furrow. Likewise, the introduction of the inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate receptor (IP 3 R) antagonist, 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, eliminates both the rising phase transient and the appearance of the furrow at the cell surface. On the other hand, antagonists of the ryanodine receptor and NAADP-sensitive channels, or simply bathing the zygote in Ca 2 +-free medium, have no effect on the generation of the rising phase positioning transient or the appearance of the furrow at the surface. This suggests that like the subsequent propagation and deepening/zipping Ca 2 + transients, the rising phase furrow positioning transient is also generated specifically by Ca 2 + released via IP(3) Rs. We propose, however, that despite being generated by a similar Ca 2 + release mechanism, the unique features of this initial transient suggest that it might be a distinct signal with a specific function associated with positioning the cleavage furrow at the <b>blastodisc</b> surface...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} shown that localized elevations of free cytosolic calcium {{are associated with a}} morphological contraction in the forming <b>blastodisc</b> and animal hemisphere cortex during ooplasmic segregation in zebrafish zygotes. It was subsequently proposed, in a hypothetical model, that these calcium transients might be linked to the contraction of a cortically located actin microfilament network as a potential driving force for segregation. Here, by labeling single-cell embryos during the major phase of segregation with rhodamine- phalloidin, direct evidence is presented to indicate that the surface contraction was generated by an actin-based cortical network. Furthermore, while zygotes incubated with colchicine underwent normal ooplasmic segregation, those incubated with cytochalasin B did not generate a constriction band or segregate to form a <b>blastodisc.</b> During segregation at the single-cell stage, ooplasm simultaneously moved in two directions: toward the <b>blastodisc</b> within the so-called axial streamers, and toward the vegetal pole in the peripheral ooplasm. The velocities of both axial and peripheral streaming movements are reported. By injection of a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labeled 2000 kDa dextran into the peripheral ooplasm it was demonstrated that a portion of it feeds into the bases of the extending streamers, which helps to explain the lack of accumulation of ooplasm at the vegetal pole.

40|$|The {{large and}} {{optically}} clear embryos of the zebrafish provide an excellent model {{system in which}} to study the dynamic assembly of the essential contractile band components, actin and myosin, via double fluorescent labelling in combination with confocal microscopy. We report the rapid appearance (i. e. within < 2 min) of a restricted arc of F-actin patches along the prospective furrow plane in a central, apical region of the <b>blastodisc</b> cortex. These patches then fused with each other end-to-end forming multiple actin cables, which were subsequently bundled together forming an F-actin band. During this initial assembly phase, the F-actin-based structure did not elongate laterally, but was still restricted to an arc extending 15 degrees {{either side of the}} <b>blastodisc</b> apex. This initial assembly phase was then followed by an extension phase, where additional F-actin patches were added to each end of the original arc, thus extending it out to the edges of the <b>blastodisc.</b> The dynamics of phosphorylated myosin light chain 2 (MLC 2) recruitment to this F-actin scaffold also reflect the two-phase nature of the contractile apparatus assembly. MLC 2 was not associated with the initial F-actin arc, but MLC 2 clusters were recruited and assembled into the extending ends of the band. We propose that the MLC 2 -free central region of the contractile apparatus acts to position and then extend the cleavage furrow in the correct plane, while the actomyosin ends alone generate the force required for furrow ingression. This biphasic assembly strategy may be required to successfully divide the early cells of large embryos...|$|E
40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that four Ca 2 + transients, generated by release from intracellular stores, are associated with cytokinesis during the early cell division cycles of zebrafish embryos (Webb et al., 1997; Chang and Lu, 2000; Lee et al., 2003). These have been termed the furrow positioning, propagation, deepening and apposition transients. Here, I clearly demonstrate that the furrow positioning Ca 2 + transient precedes {{the appearance of the}} cleavage furrow {{on the surface of the}} <b>blastodisc,</b> suggesting, therefore, that it is a key component of the furrow positioning signal. Through the introduction of the Ca 2 + shuttle buffer, dibromo-BAPTA, at specific times to challenge the individual transients, I demonstrate the requirement of the four Ca 2 + transients in the furrow positioning, propagation, deepening and apposition processes. Pharmacological studies show that all four transients are generated by Ca 2 + released via inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) receptors and not via ryanodine receptors or NAADP-sensitive channels. In addition, microinjection of IP 3 results in the release of Ca 2 + via IP 3 -sensitive stores. Furthermore, by labeling the endoplasmic reticulum and IP 3 receptors by immunocytochemistry, I demonstrate that they are initially both localized in the <b>blastodisc</b> cortex at the specific position of the future cleavage furrow; i. e., they appear prior to the physical appearance of the furrow at the <b>blastodisc</b> surface. As the furrow ingresses, they are then localized on either side of the deepening furrow. These new data thus provide additional evidence that the ER and IP 3 receptors are the intracellular Ca 2 +-store and release mechanisms, respectively, for generating all the cytokinetic transients. I also report evidence to suggest that during the first few cell division cycles in zebrafish embryos, a dynamic population of central-spindle microtubules serve a major function in positioning the cleavage furrow at the blastoderm surface. Originating from the midzone of the mitotic spindle, they develop into a mid-spindle 'pre-furrowing microtubule array' (pf-MTA) that expands upward and outward from the spindle midzone to the <b>blastodisc</b> surface. I suggest that this pf-MTA transmits positional information from the mitotic spindle to the <b>blastodisc</b> cortex that results in the correctly positioned assembly of the cytokinetic contractile apparatus. It is proposed that the pf-MTA is also involved in localizing the corticular ER to the cleavage plane, thus providing a mechanistic link between the mitotic spindle and the series of cytokinetic Ca 2 + transients. I also suggest that the pf-MTA then develops into a furrow-ingression microtubule array that helps to direct and assemble the deepening furrow as it cuts its way through the <b>blastodisc.</b> It then also plays a role in transporting key components to facilitate furrow apposition. Finally, I provide evidence for some of the possible downstream targets of the cytokinetic Ca 2 + transients. I show that the furrow propagation Ca 2 + transient co-localizes with a region of actin, which suggests that this transient may be involved in the assembly of the actomyosin contractile arc. In addition, embryos treated with a myosin II ATPase inhibitor or inhibitors of exocytosis all exhibited normal cytokinetic Ca 2 + transients but abnormal cytokinesis with respect to the shape and apposition of the daughter blastomeres. These results suggest that the propagation and deepening Ca 2 + transients are upstream in the cytokinetic sequence of events from actomyosin contractile band assembly/contraction and vesicle exocytosis, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Females {{homozygous}} for a {{mutation in}} cellular island (cei) produce embryos with defects in cytokinesis during early development. Analysis of the cytoskeletal events associated with furrow formation reveal that these defects include a general delay in furrow initiation {{as well as}} a complete failure to form furrow-associated structures in distal regions of the <b>blastodisc.</b> A linkage mapping-based candidate gene approach, including transgenic rescue, shows that cei encodes the zebrafish Aurora B kinase homologue. Genetic complementation analysis between the cei mutation and aurB zygotic lethal mutations corroborate gene assignment and reveal a complex nature of the maternal-effect cei allele, which appears to preferentially affect a function important for cytokinesis in the early blastomeres. Surprisingly, in cei mutant embryos a short yet otherwise normal furrow forms {{in the center of the}} <b>blastodisc.</b> Furrow formation is absent throughout the width of the <b>blastodisc</b> in cei mutant embryos additionally mutant for futile cycle, which lack a spindle apparatus, showing that the residual furrow signal present in cei mutants is derived from the mitotic spindle. Our analysis suggests that partially redundant signals derived from the spindle and astral apparatus mediate furrow formation in medial and distal regions of the early embryonic blastomeres, respectively, possibly as a spatial specialization to achieve furrow formation in these large cells. In addition, our data also suggest a role for Cei/AurB function in the reorganization of the furrow-associated microtubules in both early cleavage- and somite-stage embryos. In accordance with the requirement for cei/aurB in furrow induction in the early cleavage embryo, germ plasm recruitment to the forming furrow is also affected in embryos lacking normal cei/aurB function...|$|E

The area affected by the DN-p 38 expression did not correlate with the initial cleavage plane, but coincided with the side where dharma/bozozok, a dorsal-specific zygotic gene, was expressed (Yamanaka et al., 1998). Furthermore, UV irradiation and removal of the vegetal yolk mass before the first cleavage, both of which inhibit the initiation of the dorsalizing signals, abolished the asymmetric p 38 activation. Our findings suggest that asymmetric p 38 activation is required for symmetric and synchronous cleavage, and may be regulated by the same machinery that controls the initiation of dorsalizing signals.

40|$|Eggs of the Southern Brazilian {{flounder}} Paralichthys orbignyanus {{were obtained}} through spawning induction and reared in laboratory. The eggs released were free-floating or pelagic. Other important characteristics were: spherical shape, smooth chorion, narrow perivitelline space, {{and a single}} oil globule. Egg and oil globule diameter were about 0. 792 ± 0. 008 mm and 0. 114 ± 0. 003 mm, respectively. The <b>blastodisc</b> was observed approximately 1 h after fertilization and followed by <b>blastodisc</b> cleavage. Blastula stage started after about 5 h and gastrula stage after 9 h. Approximately 20 h after fertilization, blastopore closure was observed. Neurula or early embryo occurred after 24 h. Cardiac beats and movements of the free embryonic tail were recorded after 40 h of incubation. Hatching occurred after an incubation period of 40 - 50 h at temperatures ranging from 18 to 20 ºC. Newly hatched larvae were about 2. 04 ± 0. 024 mm long and quite undeveloped, with a large yolk sac with a posterior oil globule and sparse pigmentation. These results were greatly similar to those obtained by previous studies regarding congener species. This {{is one of the}} first steps towards the artificial propagation of this species under controlled conditions...|$|E
40|$|The motions {{observed}} during avian gastrulation may be simply interpreted {{in terms of}} elasto-plastic flow of sheets. Such a model allows one to calculate the flow map inside the <b>blastodisc,</b> hence the evolution of its shape. In addition, the model predicts that there exists a region of high stress oriented radially from the caudal pole towards {{the center of the}} <b>blastodisc,</b> with a tensile component oriented orthoradially. If the stress generated by cellular motion is enough to provoke a crack in the extra cellular matrix, then mesoderm ingression proceeds through a “streak” (the primitive streak) oriented from the caudal pole inwards, which relieves the stress while it creates the three germ layers. The model predicts that crack opening is next followed by crack retreat (primitive streak retreat), as mesoderm ingression continues. As mesoderm ingression proceeds around the area pellucida, similar phenomena in the anterior pole may contribute to formation of the embryo. This gives a mechanical description of avian gastrulation which complements the biochemical approach. In addition, the model provides a simple explanation to the shape of the embryo at very early stages, and possibly an explanation of the entry point of the vitteline arteries into the mesoderm...|$|E
40|$|The micropylar {{region of}} the Rosy barb, Barbus concho-nius, egg {{consists}} of 7 - 10 grooves and ridges, which drain directly into a funnel-shaped vestibule, the only point on the chorion through which sperm-egg contact is achieved during fertilization. Results of time-lapse video microscope study and computer-aided analysis of sperm motility pattern in the micropylar region snowed that the fertilizing sperm, usually the first to enter the micropylar region, always travelled preferentially along the grooves into the micropylar pit. Subsequently, 86 % of sperm arriving the micropylar region within 30 s travelled preferentially along the grooves into the im-mediate vicinity of the micropylar pit. The sperm guidance role of the micropylar region was calculated to enhance chances of egg penetration/fertilization {{by as much as}} 99. 7 % once sperm were within the micropylar region, possibly in response to some form of chemo-attractant(s) from the egg. Sperm agglutination post-fertilization was also found to occur preferentially along the grooves. Results of our in vitro fertilization exper-iments showed association between point of sperm entry and <b>blastodisc</b> formation: the <b>blastodisc</b> formed directly beneath the micropyle in all undisturbed eggs...|$|E
40|$|Through the {{injection}} of f-aequorin (a calcium-specific luminescent reporter), {{and the use}} of a photon-imaging microscope, I have visualized transient localized elevations of free cytosolic calcium in the forming <b>blastodisc</b> and in the animal hemisphere cortex that correlate with ooplasmic segregation. The introduction of an appropriate concentration of the weak (KD = 1. 5 μM) calcium buffer 5, 5 '-dibromo-BAPTA results in the dissipation of these calcium domains, and inhibits ooplasmic streaming and the subsequent formation of a <b>blastodisc</b> at the animal pole. These inhibitory actions are dependent on the final cytosolic concentration of buffer within the egg: ≥ 1. 3 mM blocks ooplasmic streaming; < 1. 3 mM eggs segregate normally. Injection of 5, 5 '-dimethyl-BAPTA (KD = 0. 15 μM) to a final concentration of 1. 5 mM as a control has no effect on ooplasmic streaming. These results suggest that localized domains of elevated free cytosolic calcium are essential for ooplasmic segregation in zebrafish. I also present direct evidence, via staining with rhodamine-phalloidin indicating that a sub-surface contraction band is generated by an actin-based network located in the animal hemisphere cortex, which I suggest is modulated via the localized calcium elevation. Furthermore, zygotes incubated in the microfilament-disrupting agent cytochalasin B (20 μg/ml) do not generate a contraction band nor segregate to form a <b>blastodisc.</b> By observing the movements of both natural and introduced ooplasmic inclusions, I calculated bulk-streaming velocities of 30 - 40 μm/min toward the animal pole in the axial streamers, and 3 - 4 μm/min toward the vegetal pole in the peripheral ooplasm. I demonstrate that the peripheral counter-flow feeds into the base of the streamers, and as a result ooplasm does not accumulate at the vegetal pole. Furthermore, treatment with cytochalasin B clearly disrupts movement in both directions. From these results, a hypothetical model is presented that links the calcium transients observed to the contraction of a cortically located actin microfilament network in the animal hemisphere, as a possible mechanism for modulating and driving bipolar ooplasmic segregation in zebrafish zygotes...|$|E
30|$|Optic {{primordium}} was discernible. Embryonic keel/shield was thickened {{and more}} somite blocks were still forming. At the anteriodorso-cephalic {{region of the}} developing embryo, the otic placode developed into otic vesicles with the early emergence of two (2) tiny otoliths. The caudal end detached gradually and frees itself totally from the <b>blastodisc.</b> Somites blocks were more closely packed and well aligned. The end spot of cellular inward movement (where blastopore closed) was apparent at the antero-caudal region moving towards meta-ventral region of the embryo as development progressed (Figure  2 W).|$|E
