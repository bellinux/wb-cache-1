5|$|Hotchkiss driver Elliott Shepard, who {{finished}} {{the first day}} in fourth, less than four minutes behind Nazzaro, spent half-an-hour working on his car {{at the start of}} the second day, fitting new tyres and changing liquids. On the eighth lap, he ran off the wooden planking at Saint-Calais but was able to resume; a wheel failure later in the lap caused him to run into a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> and forced him to retire. Panhard driver Georges Teste crashed early in the day and retired, as did Claude Richez of Renault; the sole Gobron-Brillié of Rigolly suffered radiator damage on lap seven and was forced out of the race. After two laps' running on the second day, second-placed Clément had established a 23-minute lead over Nazzaro, but this was reduced to three minutes on the following lap. Despite Nazzaro passing Clément on lap ten, a refuelling stop for the FIAT soon after put Clément back in front. Nazzaro passed again, and led Clément into the last lap of the race by less than a minute.|$|E
5|$|Several earlier {{settlements}} {{were built}} near modern Southampton featuring protective town walls. Following the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43 the fortress settlement of Clausentum was established. It {{was an important}} trading port and a defensive outpost for the town of Winchester, located {{on the site of}} Bitterne Manor, today a suburb of modern Southampton. Clausentum was defended on its eastern, landwards side by a flint stone wall and two ditches. After the fall of the Roman Empire, in the 7th and 8th centuries the Anglo-Saxons built a planned settlement called Hamwic, close to the current location of Southampton, approximately on the location of the later St Mary's church. At least some parts of this burh town had a ditch dug around it, 3 m (10 feet) wide and 1.5 m (5 feet) deep, and possibly was defended by a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth.</b> In the 10th century, Viking raids prompted the settlement of Southampton to move to its current location.|$|E
25|$|Built {{either by}} Guðfrið or by Harald Bluetooth (if {{it is the}} work {{mentioned}} as newly made in the Frankish royal annals in 808, then Harald did not build it) it stretched from the RheideÅ about 7km to a southern extension of the Schlei bay which is now a lake called Selker Noor. Its palisade was about 3m high, and {{was a little more}} solid than that on the first ramparts. The <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> behind the palisade was about 2m high and 7m wide. It had a V-shaped moat, 4m wide and 3m deep.|$|E

25|$|From {{the line}} of the walls, there may have been another {{entrance}} on the west side, but this is uncertain. A <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> appears to have been erected some distance away {{to the north of the}} castle, either as a form of defence, or perhaps to obscure the castle from a former road that ran past it from that direction. The towers seem not to have had ground-floor entrances. Putlog holes suggest that they had upper floors. Putlog holes in the curtain walls suggest the presence of hoardings to protect defenders. This large, lime-washed, stone, moated castle would have been visually impressive.|$|E
500|$|The {{walls were}} {{typically}} [...] inches thick and built of flint and mortar, with some limited use of larger sandstone blocks. The height of these walls is uncertain, but sections have survived that {{are up to}} [...] high. The walls stood on a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> between [...] and [...] wide and at least [...] high, protected by a ditch, typically [...] wide and [...] deep, but in places up to [...] wide. A [...] wide cobbled berm ran between the ditch and the wall.|$|E
500|$|Cardiff Castle was a motte-and-bailey design. The old Roman walls had {{collapsed}} and the Normans used their remains {{as the basis}} for the outer castle perimeter, digging a defensive trench and throwing up a [...] high <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> over the Roman fortifications. The Normans further divided the castle with an internal wall to form an inner and an outer bailey. In the north-west corner of the castle a wooden keep was constructed on top of a [...] tall earth motte, surrounded by a [...] wide moat. The motte was the largest built in Wales. The overall area of the castle was around the inner bailey was around [...] in area. Mills were essential to local communities during this period, and the castle mill was located outside the west side of the castle, fed by the River Taff; under local feudal law, the residents of Cardiff were required to use this mill to grind their own grain.|$|E
60|$|After three days' battering, {{breaches}} of from {{thirty to}} fifty feet wide were effected in the walls. The Saxons {{had not been}} idle. Behind each of the threatened points they raised <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> ten feet high, and cut away the bank perpendicularly behind the shattered wall, so that the assailants as they poured in at the gaps would have to leap ten feet down.|$|R
50|$|At a {{very early}} date, {{probably}} dating to the original Roman settlements, <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> were erected along {{the south side of}} the Thames in order to keep out the tidal waters and to hold them in check. One of them near the river was called Narrow Wall whilst another binding the marsh to the east was called Broad Wall, an ancient raised road which followed the line of Lambeth Marsh.|$|R
50|$|Pardalotes are {{seasonal}} breeders in temperate {{areas of}} Australia but may breed year round in warmer areas. They are monogamous breeders, and both partners share nest construction, incubation and chick-rearing duties. All four species nest in deep horizontal tunnels drilled into <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth.</b> Externally {{about the size}} of a mouse-hole, they can be very deep, at a metre or more. Some species also nest in tree hollows.|$|R
500|$|The castle was {{positioned}} {{on the east}} side of the main part of the settlement at the time, at the opposite end of the village to the church, on a spur overlooking a nearby stream. Odo erected earthworks to enclose two large baileys of around [...] each, with a large raised motte positioned in between. The western bailey was around [...] by , protected by a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> [...] tall from the base of the [...] wide ditch. The top of the earthworks formed a rampart [...] across. The western bailey had an entrance on the west side and in the north-east corner. The eastern bailey stretched down the hill to the stream, and may have held two fishponds. Another fishpond called [...] "the Fishers", further along the stream to the south-east of the castle, was also probably linked to the castle site. Around this time, an [...] "L"-shaped stone hall was constructed near the motte, in the western bailey.|$|E
2500|$|Instead {{of sitting}} on a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> as most similar floral clocks do, the Frankfort clock is {{suspended}} above a pool of water. The pool is [...] in diameter and [...] deep. Visitors often use the pool as a wishing well. Until the early 1970s, coins thrown into the pool were used by Kentucky's child care agencies to purchase recreation and gym equipment and to fund Garden Club scholarships to the University of Kentucky for students studying horticulture or land design; now the money is used solely for scholarships. The coins are collected from the pool every three weeks. In {{the first three years}} following the clock's dedication, $6,000 in coins was collected from the pool.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was about}} three in the {{afternoon}} that Rupert, to his surprise, found that [...] "the sturdy sons of freedom", as the local historians Hutton and Guest called them, were determined to fight. This determination was opposed to {{the opinion of the}} Parliamentarians—not only of the military, but also of the civilians—the ministers of Birmingham, and the leading men of the town; but the [...] "middle and inferior sort" [...] of people, especially those that bore arms, insisted on resisting, so at last they all resolved to fight. Finding such was their case, Rupert gave the order to attack their defences at once. The defences were only a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth,</b> behind which the handful of musketeers was placed. As the Royalists advanced they received so heavy a fire that on reaching the works they could not stand up against it and had to retire. A second attempt met with a similar repulse.|$|E
60|$|Down {{and down}} the fugitives toiled. And now the stream-bed was bare of boulders, and the <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth.</b> The floods that had rolled down that cañon had here borne away every loose thing. All the floor was bare red and white stone, polished, glistening, slippery, affording treacherous foothold. And the time came when Nas Ta Bega {{abandoned}} the stream-bed {{to take to the}} rock-strewn and cactus-covered ledges above.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} often {{necessary}} to widen and deepen the ditch outside {{the walls to}} create a more effective barrier to frontal assault and mining. Engineers from the 1520s were also building massive, gently sloping <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> called glacis in front of ditches so that the walls were almost totally hidden from horizontal artillery fire. The main benefit of the glaces was to deny enemy artillery the ability to fire point blank. The lower the angle of elevation, the higher the stopping power.|$|R

60|$|Jumbo, lying {{very low}} behind a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> for safety, gave another low growl. Disco started and half raised his piece. Jumbo then threw a large stone towards a {{neighbouring}} bush, which it struck and caused to rustle.|$|E
60|$|Accompanied by Nat, Mr. Playford {{went up on}} to the <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> {{that had}} been thrown up against the palisade, {{and found that the}} negroes there were all in a state of excitement, {{pointing}} in various directions and shaking their pikes angrily.|$|E
60|$|Harry now set {{his men to}} work to make loopholes in the cottages and {{inclosure}} walls, and {{to connect}} the latter by <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth,</b> having thorn branches set on the top. Just at the ford itself stood a large water-mill, worked by a stream which here ran into the river. Harry placed sacks before all the windows, leaving only loopholes through which to fire. Some of the troop carried pistols only; others had carbines; and some, short, wide-mouthed guns, which carried large charges of buckshot. Pickets were sent forward a mile toward Reading.|$|R
5000|$|In a field {{just south}} of the village are the remains of a turf {{labyrinth}} or [...] "Miz Maze", an earthwork of uncertain origin that, centuries ago, may have been used for rituals and as a meeting place. The labyrinth was laid out on banks and in the 17th century was re-cut every year by the young men of the village. It was described in 1815 in the second edition of Hutchins' History of Dorset: [...] "On an eminence in the common, {{about a quarter of a}} mile south from the village, is a maze of circular form, surrounded by a bank and ditch, and occupying an eighth part of an acre. The <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> <b>of</b> which it is composed are set almost close together, and are somewhat more than one foot in width and about half a foot in height." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hereward and Martin came {{at last to}} {{a narrow}} gully, a murderous place enough. Huge fir-trees roofed it in, and made a night <b>of</b> noon. High <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> and great {{boulders}} walled it in right and left for twenty feet above. The track, what with pack-horses' feet, and what with {{the wear and tear}} of five hundred years' rain-fall, was a rut three feet deep and two feet broad, in which no horse could turn. Any other day Hereward would have cantered down it with merely a tightened rein. Today he turned to Martin and said,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{soon as the}} new {{palisade}} is finished, all who can {{be spared}} from its defence should set to work to throw up a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> against the wall; and upon this the fighting men can take their places, and {{should be able to}} defend the palace against any assault." ...|$|E
60|$|Helen {{seized a}} tuft of heather, and sliding down, reached a narrow shelf {{four or five}} feet below. Then a small mountain-ash gave her a fresh hold and she dropped {{to the top of}} a {{projecting}} stone. Below this there was another shelf and some boggy grass, after which a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> dropped nearly straight to the stream.|$|E
60|$|Having now great {{confidence}} in Harry's judgment, the rajah at once ordered a horn to be sounded and, {{in a short}} time, {{the whole of the}} men were assembled in their stronghold; and the entrance closed by bamboos, for which holes had been already dug, close together. Then short lengths were lashed across them, and they were further strengthened by a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> piled against them.|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} five o'clock {{when he told}} her. They {{were sitting on the}} <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> a stream, where the lip of turf hung over a hollow <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> yellow <b>earth,</b> and he was hacking away with a stick, as he did when he was perturbed and cruel.|$|R
50|$|In June 1919 the Highland Railway relaid {{the section}} to Aultmore from Crooksmill and resumed goods {{services}} {{at the request of}} the local authorities. In 1925 the station buildings were restored however they were never used for passenger services. In 1937 the track was simplified and realigned to provide a layout of just two sidings and by this time the platforms had been reduced to just <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth.</b> By 10 December 1937 the track between Aultmore and Buckie had once again been lifted. The Keith signal lineman made regular visits to Aultmore to maintain the ground lever frame and the Distillery Manager's Office had a railway telephone for the purposes of ordering the delivery of waggons.|$|R
60|$|A {{hundred yards}} to the left there was a battery of six guns, and another on a mound four or five hundred {{yards to the}} right. In the daytime their fire covered the village, and there was little chance of the Germans {{attempting}} an attack until after nightfall. The enemy occupied in force a village of some size five hundred yards away, and had covered it with strong earthworks. Their outposts faced those of the French with an interval of some two hundred yards between them. The sentries on duty were stationed at distances varying from ten to twenty paces apart, behind walls or <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth.</b> The enemies' outposts were similarly protected.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, Hubert de Byes {{took him}} into his house, gave him some refreshment, and {{provided}} him with a fresh horse, sending his three sons with him as guides, whilst he himself remained to misdirect the pursuers, William safely arrived at Falaise, and, in memory of his escape, {{is said to have}} caused his path to be traced out by a raised <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth,</b> part of which is still in existence.|$|E
60|$|So they stinted their {{fighting}} for that while and they sat {{them down to}} rest, each upon a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth.</b> And a page came to the Red Knight of the Red Lands and unlaced his helm and the dwarf Axatalese did the same for Sir Gareth, and the page and the dwarf took each the helm from off {{the head of his}} master, and so they two sat where the wind might blow cold upon their faces.|$|E
60|$|The {{room was}} small and dark, as the window was closed by a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> built against it on the outside. It was some {{fourteen}} feet by eight, and here, including the newcomers, eight men lived and slept. Here the Warreners, after a few words with those who were in future to be their comrades, threw themselves down on the ground, and, {{in spite of the}} din which raged around them, were soon fast asleep.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few moments}} he {{had arrived at the}} picket-line, the men on duty there lying in groups of two and four behind little <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> scooped out <b>of</b> the slight {{depression}} in which they lay, their rifles protruding from the green boughs with which they had masked their small defenses. The forest extended without a break toward the front, so solemn and silent that only by an effort of the imagination could it be conceived as populous with armed men, alert and vigilant--a forest formidable with possibilities of battle. Pausing a moment in one of these rifle-pits to apprise the men of his intention Searing crept stealthily forward {{on his hands and knees}} and was soon lost to view in a dense thicket of underbrush.|$|R
50|$|The Irish {{spelling}} of {{the name}} is Caiseal Mhanannán, which means Manannan’s Fort, referring to a deity from Irish mythology, Manannán mac Lir. These are the foundation remains of a trivallate oval stone fort, with three closely spaced concentric <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> and stone measuring an average of 1.5 m in width each. The internal diameter measures 40 m with the external measurements being 57 m north/south and 63 m east/west. Attached to the main enclosure on {{the north and east}} sides are two rectangular enclosures, each defined by a singular bank. The exact use of Cashelmanannan is unknown, as excavation has not taken place, but {{the fact that it is}} the only structure in the complex built of stone suggests a high-status building with good defensive features.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{conurbation}} {{consisting of}} the two medieval towns of Skanör and Falsterbo. Both towns are located on the elongated reef-like {{western part of the}} Falsterbo Peninsula, (Falsterbonäset), Falsterbo to the south and Skanör to the north. The towns are separated by a several kilometers long <b>bank</b> built <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> and seaweed, and have never geographically been considered the same town.|$|R
