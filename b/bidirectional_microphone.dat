50|$|This {{coincident}} technique {{employs a}} <b>bidirectional</b> <b>microphone</b> (with a Figure of 8 polar pattern) facing sideways and a cardioid (generally {{a variety of}} cardioid, although Alan Blumlein described the usage of an omnidirectional transducer in his original patent) facing the sound source. The capsules are stacked vertically and brought together as closely as possible, to minimize comb filtering caused by differences in arrival time.|$|E
5000|$|Concurrent with A-25 production, Dynaco {{introduced}} a speaker system whereby 4-channel sound {{could be easily}} derived from stereo material by using a rear channel speaker matrix. This [...] "Dynaco patent" [...] required a single resistor and a threeway potentiometer for the two rear speakers for generating sufficient phase difference signals for a feeling of ambience. The system worked best when the stereo sound had been recorded via two <b>bidirectional</b> <b>microphones</b> on the same spot. When microphone set-up changed {{to the use of}} multiple directional microphones and multitrack tape recording and postprocessing (i.c. in the CD era), the Dynaco patent lost its market value.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the improvement in}} speech intelligibility in noise obtained with an assistive real-time fixed endfire array of <b>bidirectional</b> <b>microphones</b> in comparison with an omnidirectional hearing aid microphone in a realistic environment. DESIGN: The microphone array was evaluated physically in anechoic and reverberant conditions. Perceptual tests of speech intelligibility in noise were carried out in a reverberant room, with two types of noise and six different noise scenarios with single and multiple noise sources. Ten normal-hearing subjects and 10 hearing aid users participated. The speech reception threshold for sentences was measured in each test setting for the omnidirectional microphone of the hearing aid and for the hearing aid {{in combination with the}} array with one and three active microphones. In addition, the extra improvement of five active array microphones, relative to three, was determined in another group of 10 normal-hearing listeners. RESULTS: Improvements in speech intelligibility in noise obtained with the array relative to an omnidirectional microphone depend on noise scenario and subject group. Improvements up to 12 dB for normal-hearing and 9 dB for hearing-impaired listeners were obtained with three active array microphones relative to an omnidirectional microphone for one noise source at 90 degrees. For three uncorrelated noise sources at 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees, improvements of approximately 9 dB and 6 dB were obtained for normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners, respectively. Even with a single noise source at 45 degrees, benefits of 4 dB were achieved in both subject groups. Five active microphones in the array can provide an additional improvement at 45 degrees of approximately 1 dB, relative to the three-microphone configuration for normal-hearing listeners. CONCLUSIONS: These improvements in signal-to-noise ratio can be of great benefit for hearing aid users, who have difficulties with speech understanding in noisy environments. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Recently, Meribout [24] {{proposed}} a secure wireless sensor network-based infrastructure {{for the detection}} of eventual leaks in multiphase pipelines, i.e., the pipelines which carry more than one fluid. This technique is based on having the pipeline which carries the fluid be surrounded by another pipeline which can hold the leak detection unit. It uses an air-ultrasonic sensor and a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>microphone</b> to determine the location of the leak. However, the need of two layers makes this solution uneconomical for long-distance pipelines, and also the localization may not be fairly accurate due to the amount of noise involved in communication. Moreover, this solution does not provide proactive monitoring of pipeline health and requires high topology maintenance cost (e.g., battery power).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a secure {{wireless}} sensor network-based infrastructure for fast and accurate detection of eventual leaks that might occur in multiphase pipelines (i. e., pipelines which carry simultaneously more than one fluid). The system is scalable to monitor long distances of pipelines. It consists of a newly designed low cost pipeline set which is composed of an inner pipe that carries the multiphase fluid, surrounded by a second outer pipe that holds the leak detection unit. This latest comprises an air-ultrasonic sensor which continuously senses the presence of the leak. The location of the leak is determined by a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>microphone.</b> Both these sensors are interfaced to a wireless sensor module which performs control, signal processing, and transmission tasks. Hence, the second contribution of the paper is to provide a new secure and reliable communication protocol that takes into consideration the nature of the network in terms of packets patterns and hardware constraints of the communicating nodes. Online tests in a laboratory scale flow loop indicate that the system is capable to accurately determine the location of the leak and its rate (in l/min) in fast response time for different scenarios of leaks. ...|$|E
