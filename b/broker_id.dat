40|$|Purpose: The paper {{examines}} {{the changes in}} the price impact of trades in the major Korean stock market following the introduction of disclosure to all traders of the top five brokers on the buy-side and the top five brokers on the sell-side of trades in real time for each stock in the KOSDAQ market. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses several alternative metrics for the price impact of trades. The study applies estimation methodology that accounts for the potential endogeneity of other market quality proxies, which are used as control variables in price impact regressions, by utilizing two-stage-least-square methods with fixed effect specification. Findings: This study finds that the permanent price impact (information effect) of both buyer- and seller-initiated trades increases, which indicates that information is disseminated quicker in a transparent market. Uninformed trades have a larger permanent price impact than informed trades on both the buy and sell sides. The liquidity price effects are found to be mixed for buys and sells. Research implications: The study supports the current policy of the Korean Exchange to publicly display the five most active broker IDs on both the buy and sell sides, as it attracts both informed and liquidity traders, leading to faster price discovery in a more transparent market. However, a future study which analyzes the change in the market quality in both local markets would provide a complete picture {{of the effects of the}} policy. Originality/value: Earlier studies documenting the effect of <b>broker</b> <b>ID</b> disclosure on market quality used effective spreads, market depth or order book imbalance as market quality measures. This study contributes to the existing literature by examining the changes in direct measures of the private information effect and liquidity effect of trades in a stock market – the Korean Stock Exchange – when the other part of the exchange (the KOSDAQ stock market) shifts to public <b>broker</b> <b>ID</b> transparency at the same transparency level.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{order flow}} competition and institutional trading in modern global financial markets. It {{consists of three}} essays addressing issues on the performance drivers of an alternative trading platform, the impact of HFT activity on institutional execution cost, and broker trading behaviour and market share in the primary market. The empirical findings in these essays provide valuable insights {{into a number of}} market participants, such as sophisticated and institutional investors, brokers, regulators, exchange market operators and academics. The first essay, presented in Chapter 4, examines the determinants of Chi-X’s market share in a global context. The introduction of alternative trading venues that compete with listing exchanges has been brought about by regulatory reform and technological advances over the past decade. This essay is the first study into the performance drivers of a prominent alterative trading venue (Chi-X) in an international context. The findings in this essay contribute to the understanding of factors that influence a trader’s order routing decision and ultimately a venue’s market share. The results indicate that Chi-X's market share is negatively related to trading fees and latency relative to the primary exchange, while differences in adverse selection risk have an immaterial effect. Chi-X's market share is found to be positively related to liquidity relative to the primary exchange, measured by bid-ask spread, depth and percentage time that it displays best bid or offer. Venue market share is negatively related to order-to-trade ratio and positively related to average trade size, which suggests a trader’s preference to interact with natural and accessible liquidity. Furthermore, trading tends to concentrate on the primary exchange during market downturns and when volatility is high, while tick constraint stocks tend to trade more on Chi-X to avoid queuing at the touch on the primary exchange. Moreover, there is an improvement in market liquidity in regions where Chi-X was introduced during relatively normal market conditions. The second essay, presented in Chapter 5, examines the presence of High Frequency Trading (HFT) around large institutional trades and their price impact on NASDAQ and NYSE. The findings contribute to the understanding of HFT around institutional trades and its effect on realised execution costs. The focus on institutional price impact adds to the current literature around HFT's impact on conventional market quality metrics, such as spreads and depth, while addressing concerns that HFT adds to the difficulty of executing institutional orders, despite its perceived association with liquidity provision. The results in this chapter indicate that the impact of HFT participation on institutional execution costs vary between buy trades and sell trades. This essay also documents that institutional buy trades present higher execution costs, when the level of HFT participation is high. In contrast, institutional sell trades could be executed at better prices {{with a high level of}} HFT participation. The contrasting results can be attributable to the difference in the nature of HFTs and their respective ability and costs to short sell. Moreover, there is no evidence that HFT activities are beneficial or detrimental for the largest five percent of institutional trades. The third essay, presented in Chapter 6, studies the trading volume and market shares of brokers surrounding Seasoned Equity Offerings (SEOs) in the Australian primary market based on a unique <b>broker</b> <b>ID</b> dataset provided by ASX. Further regression analysis is conducted in this essay to examine the key determinants of the behaviour of affiliated and unaffiliated brokers around SEOs. The findings contribute to the understanding of broker affiliation around SEOs as well as providing insights into the key factors that influence a broker’s market share. The results suggest that broker affiliation has a significant impact on broker trading volume and market share on both the announcement days and issuance days. However, there is no significant evidence showing that lead managers or co-managers outperform other underwriters. Rather, the results indicate that co-managers are not expected to gain any abnormal volume or market share. Moreover, broker reputation, market capitalisation and relative offer size of the offering firm are shown as the primary characteristics influencing broker performance.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} three {{essays on}} the order submissions of institutional and individual investors in a limit order book market, the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). In addition, the thesis examines {{the effect of the}} removal of <b>broker</b> identifications (<b>IDs)</b> on investors’ order submissions on the ASX. Using the concept of order aggressiveness, which reflects investors’ impatience for trading, the first essay investigates the decision of institutional and individual investors to demand liquidity (submit market orders) and supply it (place limit orders). The findings indicate that the order aggressiveness of institutional and individual investors is positively related to the same-side market depth and negatively related to the opposite-side market depth and the bid-ask spread. Institutional investors are also more aggressive in their order submissions when volatility increases in large capitalization (cap) stocks, whereas both institutional and individual investors are less aggressive when volatility increases in medium (mid) cap stocks. Institutions and individuals follow different order submission patterns throughout the trading day, with institutions being more aggressive early in the trading day and individuals becoming more aggressive as trading progresses. Finally, following the removal of <b>broker</b> <b>IDs</b> on the ASX, both institutional and individual investors become less aggressive and more willing to supply liquidity and display their orders in the central limit order book. The second essay focuses on the information content of the limit order book and examines how it is impacted by the removal of <b>broker</b> <b>IDs.</b> This essay documents a negative relation between future volatility and variations in the liquidity provision in the order book, as captured by the order book slope. This essay also shows that the slope of the limit order book on the demand (buy) side is more informative about future volatility than the slope of the limit order book on the supply (sell) side. Institutional investors’ limit orders are also more informative about future volatility than individual limit orders. Finally, institutional limit orders become more informative about future volatility after the removal of <b>broker</b> <b>IDs</b> on the ASX, whereas minimal impact is observed for the informativeness of individual limit orders. Overall, the results in the first and second essays imply that the removal of <b>broker</b> <b>IDs</b> on the ASX makes investors more willing to submit and expose their informative limit orders in the limit order book. Therefore, this thesis supports the ASX’s decision to stop disclosing broker identity information in the central limit order book. The third essay examines the volume-volatility relation and the roles of the number of trades and average trade size, institutional trading and individual trading, and order imbalance in the volume-volatility relation. This essay provides evidence supporting a positive relation between trading volume and volatility. In addition, the number of trades has a more significant effect on volatility than average trade size. When the number of trades is decomposed into the number of trades of different sizes, the number of trades in the medium size category often has the most significant impact on volatility. This essay also shows that institutional trading and individual trading are positively related to volatility and individual trading often has a more significant effect on volatility than institutional trading. Finally, the findings in this essay indicate that on the ASX, a limit order book market, order imbalance is not the main factor behind the volume-volatility relation...|$|R

We describe Cumulative Duality matrices, an instrument to deal with design criteria for such information <b>brokers.</b> <b>ID</b> is the synthesis of Information Retrieval and Information Filtering, where information brokers act as middle-agents. There are numerous design criteria for information brokers. Since these stem from ID, they exhibit a dual nature. The duality of the criteria is shown to be cumulative.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{identify}} systematic {{differences in the}} order placement of institutional and retail traders in the Australian market. With institutions exhibiting a greater awareness of market conditions, this analysis facilitates the comparison of informed and uninformed trading behaviour. Applying <b>broker</b> <b>IDs</b> {{as a proxy for}} trader type, the characteristics and the execution costs of institutional and retail orders are analysed to compare their order performance. Retail traders demand immediacy, accounting for a disproportionate volume of market orders and aggressive limit orders. Exposed to heightened execution risk, these traders also place a higher volume of limit orders behind the quoted spread. In comparison, institutional traders, concentrating order flow within the quoted spread. As passive investors, these traders exhibit a preference for limit orders priced at the best same side quote. Whilst institutional and retail traders exhibit distinct order placement strategies, no significant differences are observed in their order execution costs...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} impact a block {{trade in the}} underlying stock market has on options listed on that stock in the options market. There is significant debate in previous literature in regards to which market leads, and which market is preferred by informed traders. This thesis contributes to, and extends previous literature, by examining the relationship between stocks and options around block trades in a different geographical setting. Furthermore, by using a combined dataset provided by SIRCA and the Australian Securities Exchange, this dissertation is able to identify individual brokers executing block trades and analyse their activity in the options market. This unique dataset allows a direct test of the “inter-market front-running” hypothesis proposed by in prior literature. Results from this dissertation are consistent with previous literature, and indicate {{that the stock market}} leads the options market by as much as fifteen minutes. Analysis of <b>Broker</b> <b>ID’s</b> confirms that {{there is no evidence of}} any inter-market front-running...|$|R
40|$|Information Discovery (ID) is the {{synthesis}} of Information Retrieval (IR) and Information Filtering (IF). In <b>ID,</b> <b>broker</b> agents act as intermediaries between user agents and source agents. Information about user interests and documents in sources can be modeled by 2 -level hypermedia representations. These representations allow navigational mechanisms which have proven their effectiveness in IR applications. Broker agents should thus combine two 2 -level hypermedia representations to obtain an overall information structure necessary for {{the synthesis}} of IR and IF. For this, we propose the so called Association Index Architecture (AIA) which consists of two 2 -level hypermedia representations which are connected through a third level which is coined the association index. The AIA thus forms a 3 -level hypermedia representation. Broker agents can perform actions in the AIA to implement their IR and IF related tasks. The AIA is {{shown to be a}} general symbolic architecture for combining knowled [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Making {{pervasive}} computing reality is a challenging task mainly {{due to the}} multitude of functional requirements and technological constraints. In parallel to the honourable research progress in specific technologies, the Daidalos project assessed that in future {{there will be the}} need for a pervasive service platform with open interfaces in order to simplify service development and provisioning. The success of such a platform depends on the balance of different aspects, e. g. operational costs with revenue potentials, collection of personal data for context-awareness with privacy protection, manual control and transparency with enhanced user experience and simplicity. In this paper we show the Daidalos approach to privacy protection and identity management for a future pervasive service platform and its architecture. We show how user identities are structured to support dynamic context information while following regulations for privacy protection in Europe. Special focus is put on the trade-off between access control for privacy protection and user experience. This is achieved by automated identity selection, automatic derivation of fine-grained access control policies and their deployment. We also present gathered performance data and implementation details of our <b>ID</b> <b>Broker</b> concept...|$|R
