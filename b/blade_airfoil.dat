The rotor blades work under conditions of intense power loading, their airfoil being erosion-corrosion destructed {{by the action of}} the moist-steam flow. Repairing companies employ quite a number of technologies to restore some of erosion-worn rotor blades.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to present and test an {{optimization}} method for the design of turbo-machinery <b>blade</b> <b>airfoils</b> with optimal performance at given flow conditions and the additional requirement that this performance remains (almost) constant even in the presence of slight manufacturing–assembling errors or slight shape changes during the operation. The proposed method goes a step beyond standard design tools ensuring the robustness of the designed shapes under uncertainties related to the design vari-ables. The basic optimization tool is a multi–objective evolutionary algorithm, which cooperates with two kinds of evaluation tools. All <b>blade</b> <b>airfoils</b> are evaluated, at the nominal flow conditions, using an integral boundary layer method coupled with an inviscid flow solver. Changes in performance, due to changes in shape are quantified through the “massive ” use of inexpensive, surrogate evaluation models. The use of surrogate models requires an initial database of evaluated samples. The sampling is carried out by means of a new, kriging-based search algorithm aiming at minimizing the database size together with the relevant CPU cost. In the course of this incremental algorithm, the new database point is the one for which kriging yields the most uncertain prediction. The robust design of a compressor cascade airfoil is demonstrated. ...|$|R
