5|$|Once {{considered}} {{as having the}} largest angular diameter of any star in the sky after the Sun, <b>Betelgeuse</b> lost that distinction in 1997 {{when a group of}} astronomers measured R Doradus with a diameter of 57.0 ± 0.5mas, although R Doradus, being much closer to Earth at about 200ly, has a linear diameter roughly one-third that of <b>Betelgeuse.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{media outlets}} tied {{the fact that}} the red supergiant star <b>Betelgeuse</b> would undergo a {{supernova}} {{at some point in the}} future to the 2012 phenomenon. However, while <b>Betelgeuse</b> was certainly in the final stages of its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years. To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. <b>Betelgeuse</b> is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth. In December 2011, NASA's Francis Reddy issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Uncertainty in the star's surface temperature, diameter, and {{distance}} {{make it difficult}} to achieve a precise measurement of <b>Betelgeuse's</b> luminosity, but research from 2012 quotes a luminosity of around , assuming a distance of 200 pc.

5|$|<b>Betelgeuse</b> is {{travelling}} supersonically {{through the}} interstellar medium at a speed of 30km per second (i.e. ~6.3AU per year) creating a bow shock. The shock is not created by the star, but by its powerful stellar wind as it ejects vast amounts of gas into {{the interstellar medium}} at a speed of 17km/s, heating the material surrounding the star, thereby making it visible in infrared light. Because <b>Betelgeuse</b> is so bright, {{it was only in}} 1997 that the bow shock was first imaged. The cometary structure is estimated to be at least 1 parsec wide, assuming a distance of 643 light-years.|$|E
5|$|Due to misunderstandings {{caused by}} the 2009 {{publication}} of the star's 15% contraction, apparently of its outer atmosphere, <b>Betelgeuse</b> has frequently {{been the subject of}} scare stories and rumors suggesting that it will explode within a year, leading to exaggerated claims about the consequences of such an event. The timing and prevalence of these rumors have been linked to broader misconceptions of astronomy, particularly to doomsday predictions relating to the Mayan calendar. <b>Betelgeuse</b> is not likely to produce a gamma-ray burst and is not close enough for its x-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or ejected material to cause significant effects on Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, astronomers using {{computer}} simulations speculated {{that even if}} <b>Betelgeuse</b> is not rotating it might exhibit large-scale magnetic activity in its extended atmosphere, a factor where even moderately strong fields could have a meaningful influence over the star's dust, wind and mass-loss properties.

5|$|On 13 December 1920, <b>Betelgeuse</b> {{became the}} first star outside the Solar System to have the angular size of its {{photosphere}} measured. Although interferometry was still in its infancy, the experiment proved a success. The researchers, using a uniform disk model, determined that <b>Betelgeuse</b> had a diameter of 0.047arcseconds, although the stellar disk was likely 17% larger due to the limb darkening, resulting in an estimate for its angular diameter of about 0.055". Since then, other studies have produced angular diameters that range from 0.042 to 0.069arcseconds. Combining these data with historical distance estimates of 180 to 815ly yields a projected radius of the stellar disk of anywhere from 1.2 to 8.9AU. Using the Solar System for comparison, the orbit of Mars is about 1.5AU, Ceres in the asteroid belt 2.7AU, Jupiter 5.5AU—so, assuming <b>Betelgeuse</b> occupying {{the place of the}} Sun, its photosphere might extend beyond the Jovian orbit, not quite reaching Saturn at 9.5AU.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Spatially-resolved {{high-resolution}} long-slit {{spectra of}} <b>Betelgeuse’s</b> circumstellar shell are described for a spectral window {{centered on the}} 7699 ˚A resonance line of neutral potassium. The Ki emission from resonance fluorescent scattering of photospheric photons which is mapped out to 50 arcsec from the star is approximately spherically symmetric with a brightness decreasing as r − 2. 36 ± 0. 03, where r is the radial distance from the star. Our measurements together with the earlier theoretical interpretation by Rodgers & Glassgold suggest that the mass loss rate is about 2 × 10 − 6 M ⊙ y − 1. The Ki emission is far from homogeneous: intensity inhomogeneities are seen down to the seeing limit of about 1 arcsec and the velocity resolution of about 2 km s − 1.

40|$|We present {{modeling}} {{research work}} of the winds and circumstellar environments of prototypical hot and cool massive stars using advanced radiative transfer (RT) calculations. This research aims at unraveling the detailed physics of various mass-loss mechanisms of luminous stars in the upper H-R diagram. Very recent 3 -D RT calculations, combined with hydrodynamic simulations, show that radiatively-driven winds of OB supergiants are structured due to large-scale density- and velocity-fields caused by rotating bright spots. The mass-loss rates computed from matching DACs in HD 64760 (B Ib) do not reveal appreciable changes from the rates of smooth wind models. Intermediate yellow supergiants (such as Rho Cas, F-G Ia 0), on the other hand, show prominent spectroscopic signatures of strongly increased mass-loss rates during episodic outbursts. Long-term spectroscopic monitoring of hypergiants near the Yellow Evolutionary Void reveals that their mass-loss rates and wind-structure are dominated by photospheric eruptions and large-amplitude pulsations that impart mechanical momentum to the circumstellar environment by propagating shock waves. In massive red supergiants, however, clear evidence for mechanical wave propagation from the sub-photospheric convection zones is lacking. Recent spatially resolved HST-STIS observations inside <b>Betelgeuse's</b> (M Iab) very extended chromosphere and dust envelope show evidence of warm chromospheric gas far beyond the dust condensation radius of RT models. Models for these long-term spectroscopic observations demonstrate that the chromospheric pulsations are not spherically symmetric. The STIS observations point {{to the importance of}} mechanical wave propagation for heating and sustaining chromospheric conditions in the extended winds of red supergiants.

5|$|Classified as a red supergiant of {{spectral}} type M1-2, {{the star}} {{is one of the}} largest and most luminous stars visible to the naked eye. If <b>Betelgeuse</b> were at the center of the Solar System, its surface would extend past the asteroid belt, wholly engulfing the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and possibly Jupiter. Calculations of its mass range from slightly under ten to a little over twenty times that of the Sun. It is calculated to be 640 light-years away, yielding an absolute magnitude of about −6. Less than 10 million years old, <b>Betelgeuse</b> has evolved rapidly because of its high mass. Having been ejected from its birthplace in the Orion OB1 Association—which includes the stars in Orion's Belt—this runaway star has been observed moving through the interstellar medium at a speed of 30km/s, creating a bow shock over 4 light-years wide. Currently in a late stage of stellar evolution, the supergiant is expected to explode as a supernova within the next million years.|$|E
