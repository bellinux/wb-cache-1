40|$|A {{major problem}} {{faced by the}} U. S. Department of Energy is the {{remediation}} of <b>buried</b> <b>tank</b> waste. Exhumation of the sludge is currently the preferred remediation method. However, exhumation does not typically remove all the contaminated material from the tank. The best management practices for in-tank treatment of wastes require an integrated approach to develop appropriate treatment agents that can be safely delivered and uniformly mixed with the sludge. Ground Environmental Services, Inc., has developed and demonstrated a remotely controlled, high-velocity, jet-delivery system, which is termed Multi-Point-Injection (MPI{trademark}). This robust jet-delivery system {{has been used to}} create homogeneous monoliths containing shallow-buried miscellaneous waste in trenches [fiscal year (FY) 1995] and surrogate sludge in a cylindrical test tank (FY 1998). During the FY 1998 demonstration, the MPI process was able to successfully form a 32 -ton uniform monolith in about 8 min. Analytical data indicated that 10 tons of a zeolite-type physical surrogate were uniformly mixed within the 40 -inch-thick monolith without lifting the MPI jetting tools off the tank floor.

40|$|The USDOE has {{initiated}} an impact assessment of existing vadose zone contamination at the Hanford Site SX tank farm in southeastern Washington State. The assessment followed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Corrective Action process {{to address the}} impacts of past tank waste releases to the vadose zone at the single-shell tank farm. Numerical models were developed that consider the extent of contamination presently within the vadose zone and predict contaminant movement through the vadose zone to groundwater. The transport of representative mobile (technetium- 99) and immobile (cesium- 137) constituents was evaluated in modeling. The model considered the accelerated movement of moisture around and beneath single-shell tanks that is attributed to bare, gravel surfaces resulting from {{the construction of the}} underground storage tanks. Infiltration, possibly nearing 100 mm yr{sup - 1 }, is further amplified in the tank farm because of the umbrella effect created by percolating moisture being diverted by the impermeable, sloping surface of the large, 24 -m-diameter, <b>buried</b> <b>tank</b> domes. For both the base case (no-action alternative) simulation and a simulation that considered placement of an interim surface barrier to minimize infiltration, predicted, groundwater concentrations for technetium- 99 at the SX tank farm boundary were exceedingly high, on the order of 10 {sup 6 } pCi L{sup - 1 }. The predicted concentrations are, however, somewhat conservative because of our use of two-dimensional modeling for a three-dimensional problem. A series of simulations were performed, using recharge rates of 50, 30, and 10 mm yr{sup - 1 }, and compared to the basecase(100 mm yr{sup - 1 }) results.

40|$|AbstractIn Italy, since 2005, {{techniques}} {{based on}} Acoustic Emission {{have been introduced}} for testing of underground LPG tanks up to 13 m 3, according to the European standard EN 12818 : 2004. The testing procedure for these tanks plans to install one or more pairs of sensors inside the “dome” suited for the access to the valves and fittings of the tank, directly on the accessible metal shell. This methodology is not applicable for the underground LPG <b>buried</b> <b>tanks,</b> where {{it is necessary to}} install a larger number of AE sensors, in order to cover at 100 % the whole tank shell, even at very deep positions. Already in 2004, the European standard EN 12820 (Appendix C - Informative) give the possibility to use Acoustic Emission testing of LPG underground or <b>buried</b> <b>tanks</b> with a capacity exceeding 13 m 3, but no technique was specified for the application. In 2008, TÜV AUSTRIA ITALIA – BLU SOLUTIONS srl - Italian company of TÜV AUSTRIA Group - has developed a technique to get access at tank shell, where tank capacity is greater than 13 m 3 and its’ diameter greater than 3, 5 m. This methodology was fully in comply with the provisions of the European Standard EN 12819 : 2010, becoming an innovative solution widely appreciated and is used in Italy since this time. Currently, large companies and petrochemical plants, at the occurrence of the tank's requalification, have engaged TÜV AUSTRIA ITALIA – BLU SOLUTIONS to install such permanent predispositions, which allow access to the tank shell - test object – with diameters from 4 to 8 m. Through this access, you can install the AE sensors needed to cover at 100 % the tank surface and then to perform AE test. In an economic crisis period, this technique is proving a valid and practically applicable answer, in order to reduce inspection costs and downtime by offering a technically advanced solution (AT), increasing the safety of the involved operators, protecting natural resources and the environment...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The low {{reliability}} of evaporation estimates in reservoirs challenges {{the management of}} water resources, especially when drought occurs.

Department of Energy and Department of Defense {{facilities}} contain wastes with gamma radiation fields up to 1000 rad per hour, solution temperatures from 20 - 95 oC, and concentrations of caustic equivalent to 3 molar sodium hydroxide. Solids settling within these tanks is of interest, as decanting of liquids {{in a timely}} fashion creates additional solids storing space within the tanks. Remote sensing of solids characteristics is imperative to reduce or eliminate worker exposure. A robust, real-time monitor was developed to determine the density profile of the tank, which allows determination of liquid phase concentration, sludge-liquid interface, settling rate of solids, and point of diminishing returns for settling. A vertical array of pressure transducers was selected as the best alternative to achieve the project goals in an accurate and cost-effective manner. The array of transducers will be installed inside a waterproof column and lowered into the tank. Transducer readings are converted into density measurements with computer software developed for the equipment. Equipment, installation, operation, decontamination, and disposal costs for a single tank are $ 769, 000 for five years of operation.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{mechanical}} industry covers {{a broad range}} of materials and structures for applications varying from pressure equipment to a winch for lifting device. Necessity to know the integrity of these structures during their service life leads to the use of acoustic emission (AE) in order to detect and characterize damage occurring in the materials and structures. This paper describes a few examples, for which AE measurement is implemented. The first one concerns the detection of damage in fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) samples during static and dynamic loading. The objective is to predict the long-term behavior of the FRP samples by the analysis of AE results correlated with ultrasonic measurements. Another application is the control of inaccessible pressure equipment (i. e., <b>buried</b> <b>tanks)</b> that requires specific conditions for sensors mounting. Monitoring of stamping process is also an interesting possibility for using AE method to detect tool breakage and chip defect.

In traditional penetrometer applications, the instrumentation package located at the tip measures soil resistance. However, for environmental monitoring purposes, an array of environmental sensors is packed inside the penetrometer rods for in-situ sampling and analysis, or for collection of laboratory samples. At present, penetrometer applications are limited primarily to vertical pushes and because of their heavy weight, the use of penetrometer trucks over shallow <b>buried</b> storage <b>tanks</b> is restricted. To close the technology gap in the use of penetrometers for environmental purposes, UTD took the initiative by developing a new position location device referred to as POLO (short for POsition LOcator), which provides real-time position location without blocking downhole access for environmental sensors. The next step taken was the initiation of work to make penetrometers steerable and capable of greater penetration capabilities.
