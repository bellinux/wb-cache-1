500|$|According to {{engineer}} Ryan Hewitt, the track contains [...] "four distinct drum sounds created by old school tape editing." [...] The song was recorded [...] "part-by-part, committing to different sounds by changing relative levels, EQ, and compression throughout," [...] and the engineers would slightly move microphones used to record Barker's drum kit to tailor the natural ambience {{of the home}} it was recorded in. Upon playback of a rough mix of the song, the engineer automated the music to fade at the song's conclusion, but mistakenly forgot {{to do the same}} for the vocal tracks. Hoppus, who had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Beach Boys at the time, liked the a cappella interplay of their voices. All agreed to keep it in the final version of the song.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of April 4, 1958, after the Oscar {{telecast}} which she had attended without him, Stompanato arrived at Turner's rented house at 730 North Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills. The two began arguing heatedly in the bedroom, during which Stompanato threatened to kill Turner, her daughter, and her mother. Fearing that her mother's life was in danger, Turner's fourteen-year-old daughter, Cheryl, grabbed a kitchen knife and ran to Turner's defense. According to testimony provided by Turner at the coroner's inquest, Cheryl, who had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> couple's fight behind the closed door, stabbed Stompanato in the stomach when Turner attempted to usher {{him out of the}} bedroom. [...] " [...] I thought [...] hit him in the stomach," [...] Turner testified in court. The killing was ultimately deemed a justifiable homicide.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce {{said the}} episode {{included}} great lines, strong personality-driven comedy and good character moments, specially Tom's emotional {{reaction to his}} painting. Pierce said the Andy and Ron subplot was [...] "so well played that it threatens to usurp the mural storyline". Sandra Gonzalez particularly praised the [...] "murinal" [...] jokes about Jerry's mural, as well as Ron's claim that he ran a sheet metal factory when he was nine, and that [...] "Child labor laws are ruining this country." [...] Time magazine television critic James Poniewozik said make jokes connected in [...] "The Camel", including the Andy shoeshine plot and the [...] "unexpectedly glamorous" [...] sewage department. But he particularly praised the character development in the main plot, in which [...] "each {{in their own way}} sticks to the purity of their uniquely screwy ideas". Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student praised the entire cast, particularly Offerman and Pratt, who he said provide the show's two best characters. Sanders said the fact that the episode included a [...] "hilarious subplot" [...] involving both of them [...] "was more evidence that the writers have <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fans".|$|E

500|$|... "Time Will Crawl" [...] {{was written}} and {{recorded}} by Bowie in mid– to late–1986 at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland. He produced the recording alongside David Richards. Lyrically, the song addresses the pollution {{and destruction of}} the planet by industry. Bowie has cited hearing of the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986 as {{the genesis of the}} lyrics, and was in Switzerland {{at the time of the}} accident. He said, [...] "I was taking a break from recording [...] it was a beautiful day and we were outside on a small piece of lawn facing the Alps and the lake. Our engineer, who had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radio, shot out of the studio and shouted: 'There's a whole lot of shit going down in Russia.' The Swiss news had picked up a Norwegian radio station that was screaming – to anyone who would listen – that huge billowing clouds were moving over from the Motherland and they weren't rain clouds." [...] In another contemporary interview, Bowie said that the song [...] "deals with the idea that someone in one's own community could be the one responsible for blowing up the world." [...] At the time, he also stated that it was his favorite song from the album.|$|E
500|$|Jay Cocks of TIME {{magazine}} {{offered a}} mixed review, stating [...] "or all its sass, {{there is something}} a little too careful about this album: the rhythms are too studied and studiobound, the sexiness slightly forced. It's as if Jackson, aware that this was her premier effort under a new, $40 million record deal, felt weighed down by the burden of proving herself. When, however, she kicks loose on What'll I Do, a nifty, '60s-style soul stirrer, it's clear that Jackson's got nothing to prove to anyone, including herself." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times compares Jackson to her brother Michael and Madonna, stating [...] "Jackson's real strength, abetted by Jam and Lewis, is the way she tops dance-club rhythms with pop melodies. Less up-to-the-second than Madonna but still effective, the Jackson team has obviously <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> competition. Madonna's 'Justify My Love' echoes in 'That's the Way Love Goes,' and 'If' resembles Michael Jackson's 'Why You Wanna Trip on Me,' starting with screaming guitar and a chanted verse, rising to a sweet melody." [...] He also comments that despite its shortcomings, [...] "he album's not about being real; it's about seamlessness and ingenuity, about giving the public something it can use. For a superstar, Jackson is downright selfless, but she gets the job done." ...|$|E
500|$|In another interview, Ehrich {{expressed}} more of {{his opinions}} on the storyline, stating: [...] "It’s so relevant now and it’s such an epidemic. Just {{for it to be}} out there to show that it happens. This is a real issue that needs to be addressed. To be a part of that, and to spread awareness feels so nice because I’ve personally experience bullying and I know many friends who have. Whether people’s reason behind it are good or bad, nonetheless, it affects kids to such an extent especially young, vulnerable kids." [...] Of the character's [...] "dark side", Ehrich stated: [...] "I love playing dark, but justifiably dark. It's never coming from a psychopathic place. First, he got obsessed with Summer, and that caused the bullying storyline, and now he's dealing with his parents' problems and possible divorce. Fenmore's issues come from a place that makes sense. It's interesting, because everyone around him is pretty much lying, and Fen {{is supposed to be the}} crazy one. Yet he's actually the truthful one." [...] He also stated that [...] "as an actor, it's fun to go out of control", saying: [...] "As an actor, it’s fun when you’re out of control, and you don’t even know you’re acting. Like, literally, you just escape. And I got to feel that. And I’ve had numerous times on this show where I’ve gotten to be out of control, and it’s a really nice feeling. It’s exhilarating." [...] He also revealed that he had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> music of John Mayer and Bruno Mars to get into Fenmore's head space. Ehrich also conceded that he didn't want Fenmore to go [...] "too far", saying: [...] "He's a really troubled kid who is just trying to find his way in life. He's not evil. I don't think he's asking for too much except for some love and trust. He's on a journey—a long, long journey to find some peace." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} pair of jealous {{strippers}} applying lipstick and caddying back-and-forth between backstage, in a South of the Border strip zoo named [...] "La Jungla". Meanwhile, Mars' [...] "Money Make Her Smile" [...] can be heard from the room, the two of them are talking about a new girl who has been [...] "fooling around" [...] with someone else's man (Mr. Mars). The scene ends with one of the two women saying, [...] "Wait 'til I tell the boss what she's sleeping with". It is shown that the new girl, Isabella, has <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conversation and it's her time to dance as soon as the boss says so. The role of Isabella is portrayed by Indian actress Freida Pinto, who after an introduction by Guzmán, the zoo owner, starts to pull off [...] "gravity-defying spins on the pole" [...] as Mars and his mates, who serve as the house band, perform the song. On the following scene, Isabella sheds her clothes with such rage that sparks fall from the ceiling while Mars stares at her intensely singing [...] "You and me baby making love like gorillas". As the second verse starts, intermittent shots of Mars and Isabella [...] "heating up the backseat of a car" [...] along with shots of her [...] "grinding on customers" [...] and banging on Mars' chest as he sings the line [...] "Bang Bang, Gorilla". The former shots are shown throughout the video. As the video continues, Isabella is shown [...] "to drop on her knees and lick" [...] Mars' guitar. She grabs it and pours tequila over the same, before using a lighter to set it on fire. Afterwards, the roof sprinklers come on and Isabella lets the water shower her while she stands on her underwear. The video ends in a chase scene in which Mars runs down through a dimly lit aisle, and suddenly transforms into a giant gorilla, while Isabella is seen {{at the end of the}} pathway waiting for him. The video doesn't contain any of the teasers Mars released days before the video, including the iguana shot, the outer car scene and the one with Luis Guzman listening to the intro for Isabella.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with their}} prior records, all four band members {{contributed to the}} songwriting of Pummel. The album {{displayed}} a darker, angrier edge {{than most of the}} band's prior work. [...] "It could possibly be our least poppy-sounding", said Stevenson. [...] "It's very hard." [...] "If you've <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last All albums, you could tell that we were pointing in this direction anyhow," [...] said Alvarez, [...] "and I think there's some staggeringly un-commercial songs on this record—songs like `Uncle Critic' and `Hetero', which don't fit into the cutesy-pie-punk routine that the radio's so enamored with right now. But we've always done stuff that might be considered more commercial than a lot of our peers have done, because we have a certain regard for pop construction and harmonies and things like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, the Fitzgeralds were back at WOR with their radio program. The show survived various format changes until September 1983, when Fitzgerald {{received}} {{a telephone call}} from the station's program director. [...] At a face-to-face meeting with both the program director and general manager, Fitzgerald was told the program would have its last airing that evening and that this last show would be recorded for broadcast so station attorneys could review it prior to its airing. Angry {{to be thought of as}} unprofessional after fifty years in radio, Fitzgerald refused to tape a last broadcast. [...] The station began receiving angry letters from Fitzgerald's many listeners, some of whom had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shows for many years. [...] There was also a good deal of adverse publicity from newspaper articles which extended beyond the coverage area of WOR.|$|E

2500|$|The {{questionnaire}} {{was divided into}} three sections based on the final report of the 2014 assembly. [...] Catholics [...] "at all levels," [...] including [...] "particular churches and academic institutions, organizations, lay movement and other ecclesial associations," [...] were invited to participate. A {{few days before the}} {{questionnaire was}} released, Pope Francis had implored theologians to listen to the faithful, and to [...] "open their eyes and ears to the signs of the times.” [...] It has been said that Pope Francis [...] "has <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> faithful and trying to break through any ecclesiastical shells that can form around the curia. [...] His desire to consult with not just with bishops but also the lay faithful, on these important family matters on how we can support family life and reach out and show support, is quite striking." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{title of}} the show {{and the name of}} the fictional town where the series takes place are derived from the song [...] "One Tree Hill", which is named after the {{landmark}} in New Zealand. Most of the show's episodes are titles of songs, bands or albums. Schwahn named the town [...] "Tree Hill" [...] because, while he was writing the idea for the show, he had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> album The Joshua Tree by U2. In the early days, fans often asked Schwahn why the show was named One Tree Hill when the town was just called Tree Hill. The question is ostensibly answered when Karen tells Lucas in episode 1.22, [...] "There is only one Tree Hill... and it's your home." [...] The same sentence was said by Haley to Jamie on the roof of Karen's Cafe in episode 9.13, the series finale.|$|E

In addition to helping with fundraisers, Sosnovska was outspoken about gay marriage. [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> debate about gay marriage, she said.

Love also stated that [...] "half the fucking songs were written in the studio." [...] According to Love, the songwriting process for the album was [...] "really easy": [...] "We started at [...] Jabberjaw. I wrote [...] "Violet" [...] there. Then we moved to Seattle in the middle of that. [...] "Miss World" [...] was written in Seattle, if I remember correctly... We had this great rehearsal space : It was just perfect, up on Capitol Hill, near the Urban Outfitters. Everyone got really close. There was just a great flow."
