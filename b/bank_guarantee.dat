The BCCI claimed that it had sent several requests for payment to the franchise owners but received no response. On 19 September 2011, then BCCI president N.

25|$|The foreign {{borrowings}} of Irish banks {{rose from}} €15 billion to €110 billion in 2004-08. Much {{of this was}} borrowed on a three-month rollover basis to fund building projects {{that would not be}} sold for several years. When the properties could not be sold due to oversupply, the result was a classic asset–liability mismatch. At the time of the <b>bank</b> <b>guarantee</b> the banks were said to be illiquid (but not insolvent) by €4 billion; {{this turned out to be}} an enormous underestimate.|$|E

25|$|By 2009, {{suggestions}} of a rivalry between Modi and N. Srinivasan surfaced. During 2009–10, Lalit Modi oversaw the bidding process for induction {{of two new}} teams in the Indian Premier League. In December 2009, he inserted two new clauses in {{the invitation to tender}} (ITT): the bidder should have a net worth of at least USD 1 billion and must provide a <b>bank</b> <b>guarantee</b> of USD 100 million. Modi stated that these clauses protected BCCI's interests. However, other BCCI board members claimed that he was rigging bids to suit Adani Group and Videocon Group, as the new clauses would rule out most of the other prospective bidders. After the ITT was floated on 22 February 2010, some of the prospective bidders, including Sahara Group and Jagran Group, complained to the BCCI President Shashank Manohar that they were being deliberately kept out of the tendering process. After receiving only two bids, IPL changed the ITT, removing the net worth clause and reducing the guarantee amount to USD 10 million.|$|E
