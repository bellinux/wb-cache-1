He told her Cristina was very kind, but he wanted to be single and date other girls. Cisneros then called Fischer's father, <b>Buddy,</b> and asked him why his son had broken up with Cristina. Fischer was angry that Cristina did not return his ring, and wrote a letter to her saying that he wanted his ring in ten days, or he would take action. Cisneros then called <b>Buddy</b> and told him she wanted to talk about his son's ring and other things; both agreed to meet at a Burger King. Cisneros asked <b>Buddy</b> why Fischer broke up with Cristina, and <b>Buddy</b> said that was between his son and her. He said his son was old enough to make his own decisions, and that he would not get involved. Cisneros then asked him if he knew Fischer drank, and he responded that at his son's age it was not {{uncommon}} to drink. Cisneros then said she had seen Fischer drunk once before, but his father responded by saying if he had been drunk before, it was not in his presence. Sex never came up in the conversation. <b>Buddy</b> told Cisneros he would speak to his son about acting like a gentleman; Cisneros promised to return Fischer's ring. <b>Buddy</b> recalled the meeting was awkward but friendly.|$|E

5|$|Single {{cylinder}} with dual regulators {{consists of}} a single large back mounted cylinder, with two first-stage regulators, each with a second-stage regulator.

The advantage is that a regulator failure can be solved underwater to bring the dive to a controlled conclusion without <b>buddy</b> breathing or gas sharing. However, {{it is hard to}} reach the valves, so there may be some reliance on the dive <b>buddy</b> to help close the valve of the free-flowing regulator quickly.|$|E
