25|$|Peat {{is widely}} used in <b>balneotherapy</b> (the use of bathing to treat disease). Many {{traditional}} spa treatments include peat as part of peloids. Such health treatments have an enduring tradition in European countries including Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Austria. Some of these old spas {{date back to the}} 18th century and are still active today. The most common types of peat application in <b>balneotherapy</b> are peat muds, poultices, and suspension baths.|$|E
25|$|Various therapies used in {{the present-day}} {{hydrotherapy}} employ water jets, underwater massage and mineral baths (e.g. <b>balneotherapy,</b> Iodine-Grine therapy, Kneipp treatments, Scotch hose, Swiss shower, thalassotherapy) or whirlpool bath, hot Roman bath, hot tub, Jacuzzi, cold plunge and mineral bath.|$|E
25|$|In 1850, Fătu {{contributed a}} {{monograph}} on {{the prevention of}} malaria; he also focused his activity on obstretics, <b>balneotherapy</b> and dietetics, with Învățătură dietetică relativă la scrofule ("A Dietary Instruction against Scrofulae"), followed by Descrierea și întrebuințarea apeĭ simple și a apelor minerale din Moldova ("Description and Use of Plain and Mineral Water in Moldavia", 1851) and Manualu pentru învățĕtura móșelor ("A Textbook of Midwife Instructions", 1852). At the time, he insisted, against religious observance and popular superstition, that women wash themselves as often as possible; he also began advocating a government-sponsored program of spa tourism, but his proposal was casually ignored. Fătu's hypothesis that sulfur baths could work against syphilis was more reserved than other claims to the same effect from his contemporaries, but nonetheless contributed to a prevailing mythology in later folk medicine.|$|E
25|$|In Moldavia, Constantin {{became famous}} for his {{advocacy}} of <b>balneotherapy,</b> and also for his work during the 1848 cholera epidemic: {{he was the only}} doctor of Iași to have survived the calamity. This was particularly unusual, as he did not believe that cholera was contagious, and relied on folk medicine in his attempts to cure it. He shared some of Scarlat's views about modernization, publishing his plans to set up a sanitary service and medical schools. From 1844, he was also son-in-law of the Wallachian Prince Gheorghe Bibescu, a conservative figure. Nonetheless, the Students' Society revolutionary connections irritated Bibescu, and also caused concern in Russia, which, at the time, shared custody of the Principalities. Despite Lamartine's support, these developments also worried the French monarchy, which was transitioning to conservatism. The Guizot government chose not to give any recognition to the Society, pushing it into the underground.|$|E
25|$|Anastasie Fătu (originally Năstase Fêtu or Fĕtu, {{also known}} as Anastasius Fétul, Anastasie Fĕtul or Anastase Fătul; January 2, 1816 – March 15, 1886) was a Moldavian and Romanian physician, naturalist, philanthropist and {{political}} figure, a titular member of the Romanian Academy and founder of Iași's Botanical Garden. Of lowly origins, he benefited from the meritocratic program instituted by Moldavia's government in the 1830s, {{and went on to}} study law at the University of Vienna, with hopes of becoming a political economist. After graduating, he changed his professional path, and trained in medicine at the University of Paris. Recognized for pioneering contributions in cardiology, pediatrics, obstetrics and <b>balneotherapy,</b> he was also an early speaker for public health and social medicine, as well as an educational theorist and textbook author. Fătu's career as a professor of natural sciences took him to the Gregorian Institute, the Socola Monastery school, and ultimately Iași University, where he took steps to create a regional medical school.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{overcoming}} initial setbacks, the Academic Society {{was experiencing}} a financial impasse, which were felt especially {{hard by the}} science section. Partly in order to remedy this, in August 1872, Fătu donated 10,000 [...] "new lei" [...] {{for the creation of}} his eponymous fund, with prizes going to Romania's best scientific cartography, and also the entire collection of Revista Științifică. For a long time, however, no researcher applied to collect his prize. Also in August 1872, with Crețulescu replacing Laurian as Academy chairman, Fătu became its vice president, in succession to Massim. On September 19, he was also elected president of the scientific section (serving to 1876). On the occasion, his fund was split into prizes for botany, agronomy, geology, chemical engineering, and <b>balneotherapy.</b> Moreover, Fătu and Petru Poni insisted on sponsoring a meteorological sub-section, which became operational in September 1874 and employed Ionescu de la Brad as one of the main surveyors. Fătu also helped Ionescu de la Brad set up his own (since lost) botanical garden, at Negri.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Balneotherapy</b> (balneum [...] "bath") is the {{treatment}} of disease by bathing, usually practiced at spas. While it is considered distinct from hydrotherapy, there are some overlaps in practice and in underlying principles. <b>Balneotherapy</b> may involve hot or cold water, massage through moving water, relaxation, or stimulation. Many mineral waters at spas are rich in particular minerals such as silica, sulfur, selenium, and radium. Medicinal clays are also widely used, which practice is known as 'fangotherapy'.|$|E
