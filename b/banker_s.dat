50|$|The {{government}} of the grand duchy of Baden asked Chorin (on February 3, 1821), through the <b>banker</b> <b>S.</b> Haber, for his opinion about the duties of a rabbi, and about the reforms in the Austrian states. Chorin answered by writing Iggeret Elasaf, or Letter of an African Rabbi to His Colleagues in Europe, which was published by M. I. Landau (Prague, 1826). In it he stated that the Torah comprised religious truths and religious laws, the latter partly applicable only in Palestine, partly obligatory everywhere. These may be temporarily suspended, but not entirely abolished, by a competent authority, such as a synod. Only ordinances and precautionary laws which are of human origin may be abrogated in conformity with {{the circumstances of the}} time. As for mere customs and usages (minhagim), the government, after having consulted Jewish men of knowledge, may modify or abolish them; but in no other way may it interfere with religious affairs. Chorin also pleaded for the establishment of consistories, schools, a theological seminary, and for the promotion of agriculture and professions among the Jews. Some of these ideas he carried out in his own congregation, which included a great number of mechanics. He succeeded in founding a school, and introducing liturgical reforms into the synagogue; even an organ was installed at his instance. He permitted the eating of rice and pulse during the days of Passover.|$|E

A dataset of actual consumer loans is used for evaluating the algorithm. The experiments reported show that QLC performs better than other cost-sensitive algorithms on this dataset. 1.

The Impacts of Japanese Auction-Priced IPOs Many researchers suggest that investment <b>bankers</b> cause U. <b>S.</b> IPOs to be underpriced. In Japan, all IPOs are auctioned, reducing {{the role of}} underwriters. These price-competitive auctions do not result in significantly lower initial returns than those from U. S. underwriter-priced IPOs. However, initial returns from auctions do not react {{in the same manner}} to market movements, insider sales, and underwriter quality as underwriterpriced initial returns. Yet, initial returns from both auction-priced and underwriter-priced IPOs are significantly related to issue size and indicate the presence of a strong partial adjustment phenomenon. In sum, investors in auctions underpriced IPOs similar to underwriters. In the U. S., IPOs are priced by investment bankers after gaining knowledge of potential interest from investors, often called “book building. ” Various methods are used such as “road shows ” and direct solicitations to obtain indications of interests at various potential offer prices...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} has as main {{objective}} {{to reflect the}} state of literature regarding free cash flow, and to withdraw the main pro's and con's {{in order to create}} an objective image upon this indicator. The main idea generating this research was the growing interest on cash flow reporting. As many say, "Cash Flow is King", while in Anglo Saxon countries the interest of investors and analysts in concentrated on operating cash flow, as the most important indicator of the probability of bankruptcy. In this context, voluntary additional reporting, like free cash flow may come either as an aid in providing the fair view or as an opportunistically reported figure. Throughout the paper, the intention was to provide answers to three main research questions: "What are the definition and calculation method of free cash flow? Why is there an interest in free cash flow reporting? What is the impact of free cash flow on the agency theory?" In order to provide relevant conclusions, four international data basis were used, and related articles and studies were extracted. The results proved that there is no generally accepted definition and computing method, while the format depends on the end-user of the report (shareholders, investors, analysts, <b>bankers,</b> a. <b>s.</b> o.). As stated below, this aspect generates confusion and lack of comparability, giving room to creative accounting techniques. Moreover, the interest on free cash flow reporting is connected mainly to liquidity assessment, company valuation and investors' choice. Still, in the context of agency theory, results show that in presence of high free cash flow, managers tend to make investment choices that satisfy their personal interest and that generate low efficiency and profitability for the company. The contribution to current state of research is providing a literature review study, focused on a comparative approach, as well as on underlying an objective image upon a debatable financial indicator and accounting report. free cash flow, reporting, management, agency theory, creative accounting...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the progress of}} bank design {{against the background of}} the evolution of the banking profession, its constitutional distinctions, and national architectural trends. Beginning with the Bank of England and the premises of London private bankers, the enquiry broadens to provincial private banking. Chapter Two discusses the buildings of early jointstock banks, showing that new banking companies had the experience of Scotland to turn to, where joint-stock banks had long been legal. In the 1840 <b>s,</b> <b>bankers</b> and architects found the Italianate style increasingly appropriate. However, philanthropic savings banks, whose buildings are discussed in Chapter Three, often found Gothic or Tudor designs suitable. A dimension of parliamentary control, also arising from the banks' charitable status, allows a table to be attempted (as an Appendix) of all purpose-built savings banks by the end of 1852. A reorganization of banking, with London at its centre, began in the 1860 s. The rebuilding which this entailed is described in Chapter Four. The same period saw the first of many hundreds of mergers and the beginning of national branch networks. It was also the time when the Gothic Revival had some direct influence on banking, particularly in the Midlands and North. Chapter Five treats of the confusion of styles around 1900, the first signs of environmental concern, the influence of aesthetic movements, and the gradual evolution of a 'Queen Anne' style, which was to develop into the safe neo-Georgian of the 1920 s, a theme taken up in Chapter Six. A brief, harmonious interlude between the Wars is discussed in the context of informed, architectural criticism, led by C. H. Reilly. The period since 1945 is handled briefly in terms of the factors which channel the study of banking architecture into new areas. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 This {{dissertation}} is {{a history}} of the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis. It explores the cultural and material causes and consequences of the city’s near bankruptcy and subsequent social and fiscal restructuring. It argues that the cause of the crisis was a combination of a severe economic depression in the city’s real economy, and a market failure, the worst in the nation’s history, in the municipal bond market. The combination of these factors meant that the city was forced into deficit spending, and simultaneously frozen out of the credit markets. With the federal government taking no action, the city was forced to make severe, historic, cuts on its social programs, a move to austerity that has come to define our own era. This shift requires more than a fiscal explanation, as previous crises, when deficits were twice as large as those of the 1970 s, were successfully navigated without the resort to the kinds of austerity seen in 1975. Instead, we have to look to a cultural turn {{on the part of the}} city’s elites. Where in the 1960 <b>s,</b> <b>bankers,</b> state planners, and academics were willing to manage deficits as part of a larger social contract that included a commitment to the city’s poor, by 1975 that commitment was largely undone. The rejection was a reaction to the victories of the social movements of 1960 s, specifically those for civil rights and black liberation. City elites sought mechanisms to check the costs, and more, the power and the politics, of the movements. This was achieved through fiscal measures, which profoundly reshaped social life in New York. The result for working people, women, and people of color was a pervasive sense of hopelessness and despair, evident even decades later, the artistic work of figures like Notorious B. I. G. His 1994 album of lost opportunity and personal “everyday struggle” spoke for the generation born to austerity; Big and his generation were “Ready To Die. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} banks {{have had to}} operate in an {{increasingly}} competitive environment. How banks {{will be affected by}} the increased competitive pressures depends in part on how efficiently they are run. This paper uses the stochastic econometric cost frontier approach to study efficiency at banks in the Third Federal Reserve District. The paper looks at scale efficiency - whether banks are operating with the efficient level of outputs; scope efficiency - whether banks are operating with the efficient mix of outputs; and x-efficiency - whether banks are using their inputs efficiently. The cost model differs from previous studies in that it explicitly accounts for the quality of banks' assets and the probability of failure, which influences banks' costs in a number of ways. The paper also differs from previous studies in its treatment of financial capital as an input into the production process. In addition to providing a cushion against losses, financial capital can be used to fund loans as a substitute for deposits or borrowed funds. The paper differs in a third way in reporting confidence intervals for the bank- specific measures of efficiency. There {{do not seem to be}} many cost efficiency gains made from Third District banks' changing their sizes, and these results are much like those obtained in studies using U. S. samples. The model shows that there is no evidence of either scope economies or diseconomies at the average efficient bank in the Third District, nor at banks in different size categories. While the scope measures suggest there is no cost justification for joint production, the approach leaves open the possibility of revenue benefits. Average x-inefficiency at banks in the Third District is on the order of 6 % to 9 %. In competitive markets not all of this gain would be retained by the bank - the savings would be passed on to customers - increasing overall welfare. When compared to U. S. samples, Third District banks seem to be outperforming U. <b>S.</b> <b>bankers</b> on average in this regard. A simple correlation and regression results indicate that inefficient banks in the District tend to be younger. There is no statistically significant differences in efficiency across the three states. There is no evidence that larger banks are more or less x-efficient than smaller banks. Inefficient banks have a higher percentage of loans in construction and land development, and loans to individuals. One of the more interesting relationships is the negative relationship between inefficiency and the capital-asset ratio. It may indicate that higher capital may prevent moral hazard. In conclusion, inefficient banks may have more to fear from efficient producers than from banks producing particular volume or product mix. ...|$|R
