5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female mallards can become aggressive, driving off competitors to {{themselves or their}} mate by charging at them. Males tend to fight more than females, and attack each other by repeatedly pecking at their rival's chest, ripping out feathers and even skin on rare occasions.|$|E

5|$|A {{field study}} in Brisbane found that F. rubiginosa trees often bore <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female phase syconia {{at the same}} time, which could be {{beneficial}} for reproduction in isolated populations. The same study found that male phase syconia development persisted through the winter, showing that its wasp pollinator tolerated cooler weather than those of more tropical fig species.

5|$|A {{resistance}} movement developed in Belgium {{soon after the}} German occupation. The resistance took various forms. Although some sabotages by the resistance, notably {{the destruction of the}} Brussels-Aachen railway line, were celebrated at the time, armed resistance represented a minority of their acts. Around 300 separate resistance networks existed which often included <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female members.|$|E

5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{it is not}} only males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, {{although}} most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female, may be evicted.|$|E
5|$|Despite its disappointing box-office returns, in {{what was}} then {{considered}} a risky move, Warner Home Video shipped 320,000 rental video copies throughout the United States in 1995.

Positive recommendations and repeat customer viewings, and being well received by <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female audiences, were considered key to the film's rental success.|$|E
5|$|Pteranodon {{species are}} {{extremely}} well {{represented in the}} fossil record, allowing for detailed descriptions of their anatomy and analysis of their life history. Over 1,000 specimens have been identified, though less than half are complete enough to give researchers good information on the anatomy of the animal. Still, this is more fossil material than is known for any other pterosaur, and it includes <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female specimens of various age groups and, possibly, species.|$|E

5|$|A {{school was}} founded in Deir Ghassaneh in 1925. Prior to the British Mandate period, boys would {{normally}} receive education in a kuttab, an elementary-type school with Islamic law and tradition having {{a major influence on}} the curriculum. Today, there is one elementary school (Bani Zeid Elementary School) and one secondary school (Bashir al-Barghouti Secondary School) in the town of Bani Zeid, both run by the government. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education, in the 2010-2011 academic year there were 26 classes occupied by 691 students, <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female. There was 45 teaching staff. There are no kindergartens in Bani Zeid. The closest institution for higher learning is Birzeit University in the village of Bir Zeit to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all species}} are hermaphrodites, {{in other words}} each {{individual}} can function as <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time, while others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. The gonads {{are located in the}} parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. Fertilization is generally external, but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.|$|E
5|$|Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, may {{go through}} {{up to seven}} nymphal stages (instars), {{requiring}} a meal of blood each time. Their life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs {{over the course of}} her lifetime. Larvae feed very quickly and detach to molt into nymphs. <b>Both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process which is unique to argasid ticks.|$|E

5|$|At {{the edge}} of the Greenstead Parish {{boundary}} is Rovers Tye Farm, which has been documented as being established by 1353. A new causeway at this location had been built by 1429, by which point Ipswich Road ran on its current route. This road was turnpiked in 1725, when the road was predominantly rural in nature. In 1841, a prison, known as the House of Correction or County Gaol, was built on the road to alleviate pressure on Colchester Castle, but it only held about 25 or 30 prisoners, <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female, at any one time.|$|E
5|$|<b>Both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female mockingbirds sing, {{with the}} latter being {{generally}} quieter and less vocal. Male commencement of singing is in late January to February and continues into the summer and the establishing of territory into the fall. Frequency in female singing is more sporadic, as it sings less often {{in the summer and}} fall, and only sings when the male is away from the territory. The mockingbird also possesses a large song repertoire that ranges from 43 to 203 song types and the size varies by region. Repertoire sizes ranged from 14 to 150 types in Texas, and two studies of mockingbirds in Florida rounded estimates to 134 and 200, approximately. It continually expands its repertoire during its life, though it pales in comparison to mimids such as the brown thrasher.|$|E
5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} salvation is extended to all of mankind equally. Unusually, he suggests that Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. He is supportive of women playing {{an active role in the}} leadership of the church, and provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by Gnosticism. However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge , is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and come to know God.|$|E
