50|$|Silicon is unlike, e.g. aluminium, an inert anode. In result no ions drift out of {{the silicon}} into the glass during the <b>bond</b> <b>process.</b> This affects a {{positive}} volume charge in the silicon wafer on the opposite side. As a result a few micrometer thick high-impedance depletion region is developed at the bond barrier in the glass wafer. In the gap between silicon and glass the bond voltage drops.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this initial}} phase of work, two methods of {{backside}} wafer thinning using ICP plasma etching of two-inch SiC substrates have been considered. Plasma processes were optimized for non-bonded and bonded wafers. The non-bonded process {{was used to}} etch 250 µm thick substrates to a final thickness of 100 µm. The <b>bonded</b> <b>process</b> was used to etch glass bonded SiC substrates mechanically ground to 130 µm thick and plasma etched to a final thickness of 100 µm. Etch rate measurements and surface analysis were performed using a profilometer and white light interferometry. Etch rates of 3. 4 µm/min were achieved for the <b>bonded</b> <b>process</b> and 2. 0 µm/min for the non-bonded process. The surface morphology for the non-bonded process was {{three to four times}} lower than the <b>bonded</b> <b>process.</b> The part mechanically ground samples showed evidence of surface damage from the grinding process after plasma etching...|$|R
25|$|Nests may be {{built in}} a wide variety of places – on the ground, in dense {{floating}} vegetation, in bushes, or at any height in trees. They are bulky structures of rushes, sticks or other materials. Nest building is undertaken by the male initially, who will construct the nest in his territory prior to pair-bond formation. Unpaired females will visit a number of territories before settling on a male to breed with. Males may initially challenge and fight off prospective mates, and may not accept first-year females as mates. Pair-bond formation may take a few weeks. Courtship feeding is part of the <b>bonding</b> <b>process,</b> where males catch and process a snail and then feed it to the female.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} is explicitly {{told that he}} is reacting normally to extreme stress {{and is expected to}} recover and return to full duty in a few hours or days. A military leader is extremely effective in this area of treatment. Of all the things said to a Service member suffering from combat stress, the words of his small-unit leader have the greatest impact due to the positive <b>bonding</b> <b>process</b> that occurs during combat. Simple statements from the small-unit leader to the Service member that he is reacting normally to combat stress and is expected back soon have positive impact. Small-unit leaders should tell Service members that their comrades need and expect them to return. When they do return, the unit treats them as every other Service member and expects them to perform well. Service members suffering and recovering from combat stress disorder are no more likely to become overloaded again than are those who have not yet been overloaded. In fact, {{they are less likely to}} become overloaded than inexperienced replacements.|$|E
