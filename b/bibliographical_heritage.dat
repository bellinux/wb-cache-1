40|$|A propósito do valor histórico e da importância da Biblioteca do Mosteiro de São Bento de São Paulo pela conservação de um {{singular}} patrimônio bibliográfico, pretendemos compreender fragmentos de sua história a partir da bibliografia histórica e da cultura monástica entre livros, leituras e bibliotecas. Para tanto, a pesquisa se desenvolveu em três linhas de investigação: a primeira, a análise de obras e de documentos que nos permitiram resgatar aspectos históricos e culturais que proporcionaram a formação da Biblioteca- Livraria no contexto do monaquismo beneditino; a segunda, o estudo da bibliografia histórica e da cultura monástica de livros e de leitores em uma perspectiva de longa duração e dialética com a Biblioteca-Livraria e a sua Coleção de Livros Antigos; e a terceira, a elaboração do Catálogo da Coleção de Livros Antigos da Biblioteca-Livraria do Mosteiro e a identificação de alguns de seus objetos bibliográficos, assim como dos princípios de organização destes. A partir do estudo realizado, entendemos que entre os monges beneditinos sempre houve diversos sinais de uma reflexão e orientação profunda a respeito de bibliotecas e de livros e que a própria Biblioteca-Livraria é reflexo da mentalidade beneditina e emblema mesmo da instituição monástica, de modo que os aspectos espirituais, históricos e culturais do monaquismo beneditino constituem elementos configuradores das etapas de formação de sua identidade bibliográfica e informacional. Concerning {{the historical}} {{significance of the}} Library of Saint Benedicts Monastery of São Paulo in its conservation of a unique <b>bibliographical</b> <b>heritage</b> we intend to understand fragments of its history. Our approach is from {{a point of view}} of the historical bibliography and the monastic culture found in books, readings and libraries. Within that framework, the research was developed along three lines of investigation: the first one, the analysis of books and documents that allow us to rescue the cultural and historical aspects that provided for the formation of the Old Library in the context of Benedictine monasticism; the second, the study of the historical bibliography and the monastic culture of books and readers from a long term and dialectic perspective with the Old Library and its Old Books Collection; and the third, the elaboration of a Catalogue of the Old Books Collection of the Monasterys Old Library and the identification of some of its bibliographical objects, as well as the principles of their organization. We understand, from the research we conducted, that among the Benedictines there has always been various signs of reflection and profound orientation regarding libraries and books and that the Old Library itself is a consequence of the Benedictine mind-set and an emblem of the monastic institution, so that the spiritual, historical and cultural aspects of the Benedictine monasticism constitute elements of the phases of formation of its bibliographical and informational identity...|$|E

40|$|Document, collection, fonds, {{cultural}} <b>heritage</b> (<b>bibliographical,</b> archival, cultural [...] .), culture, {{knowledge and}} communication are undoubtedly {{the basis of}} a discourse rooted in Modernity that has come to increasingly include the vague, but highly fashionable, concept of Information. This concept transverses many sectors of activity and can be easily appropriated and used by any socio-professional group or by any anonymous individual, showing its exponential and potentially dangerous use, resulting from its semantic ambiguity. Therefore, a discussion of the ontological and epistemological issues becomes an absolute requirement for any scientific discipline endeavouring to establish a solid base, as well as openness to a challenging and inexorably progressive dynamic. This aim is naturally transposed to our field of work, Information Science. In this text, part of a tetralogy that began with an essay on ‘Knowledge and Information’ and which will be followed by two more (‘Culture and Cultural Heritage in the Information Age’ and ‘Information and Communication’), it is our aim to emphasize the human and social phenomenon underlying such common, yet insufficient, terms, as document/documentation, which, strictly speaking, only refer to an intermediate stage in the psychosomatic phenomenality of creation/assimilation of information (mentally encoded representations from language to image), to the communication processes with one or more interlocutors/receivers. Consequently, the document is the materialization of Information (registered on a physical medium), which advances communication. The latter, however, is only fully consummated when a complete adjustment and interaction between sender and receiver occurs...|$|R

Vietnamese <b>heritage</b> {{language}} learners (VHLLs) have rarely been researched {{even though they}} represent a growing percentage of language students in {{higher education in the}} United States. This research investigates some basic aspects of the VHLLs including their needs, wants, issues, and challenges. In addition, for the Vietnamese language in the U. S. there are pressures and preferences about dialect, which are also examined. To do so, a qualitative, 5 year crosssectional, case study approach was used to learn about the VHLLs in higher education, specifically the 2 nd-year VHLLs in Hawaii. The qualitative methods include: surveys (n = 59), student interviews (n = 13), 2 interviews with the language teacher, and classroom observations while utilizing language socialization and language ideology theoretical frameworks to view the data. This information allows other researchers to expand on these foundational aspects and creates the opportunity for a cross comparison with other heritage {{language learners}}. Finally, language instructors can use this information to better tailor their curriculum to the needs and wants for their VHLLs. Some results for the Vietnamese language classes include: the language instructor was the most liked aspect; classes early in the morning were the least liked aspect; speaking skills was the issue of importance; and grammar was the most challenging aspect. The VHLLs dialect change had a range of consequences with their communities from unproblematic to highly problematic. Additional research on the VHLLs is needed, but this research provides foundational elements to understanding a growing group of language learners...|$|R
