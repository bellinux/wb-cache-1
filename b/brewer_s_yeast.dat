In this research we studied the effect of hydrolysed yeast product (ProgutTM) on the microbial flora of a horse as determined in faeces. ProgutTM is hydrolysed yeast product manufactured from <b>brewer</b> <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Ten Finnhorse mares were fed basal diet of hay and oats for three weeks before first microbial samples were taken. After the first samples, yeast hydrolysate was added on the diet and after feeding period of another three weeks the second microbial sample was taken. Aerobic and anaerobic total bacteria, enterobacteria, Lactobacillus, lactate producing bacteria, bifidobacteria and Bacteroides- prevotella were determined from faeces. Volatile fatty acids (VFA) and pH were also determined. The total count of aerobic bacteria declined after the addition of the yeast product. The enterobacteria and Bacteroides-prevotella -group increased and bifidobacteria decreased. No change was observed in total anaerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria or Lactobacillus. VFAs were more homogenous between animals after yeast product addition. vo...|$|E

Brewer's yeast is also very rich in {{essential}} minerals and the B vitamins (except B12). However, baking and brewing yeasts typically belong to different strains, cultivated to favour different characteristics: baking yeast strains are more aggressive, to carbonate dough in the shortest amount of time possible; brewing yeast strains act slower but tend to produce fewer off-flavours and tolerate higher alcohol concentrations (with some strains, up to 22%).|$|R

Hot water extraction (100 ° C, 5 hours) and subsequently an alkaline extraction of sediment using 1  M NaOH at 90 ° C for 1 hour were used. β-glucan concentrate containing 59, 15 % of β-glucan had good functional properties (water binding capacity 13, 34 g water/ 1 g concentrate, fat binding capacity 6, 86 g fat/ 1 g concentrate) and indicated biological action too.   At concentration of 2 mg/ml DMSO (dimethylsulfoxid) was viability of murine L 1210 leukemic cells reduced to  76. 15 %. When observing the antioxidant activity it was identified, that the lipid peroxidation in linoleic acid samples was decreased during the presence of β-glucan concentrate. These results and good sensory properties like a bright colour and the pleasant taste and smell indicate, that prepared β-glucan concentrate has a potential {{to be used to}} improve the health – beneficial substances in the foods. doi: 10. 5219 / 258 <!

40|$|International audienceTorula yeast (Candida utilis) {{was found}} to metabolize {{selenium}} in a totally different way to <b>Brewer's</b> <b>yeast</b> (<b>S.</b> cerevisiae) leading to the biosynthesis of selenohomolanthionine (SeHLan), a major selenium compound accounting for 60 – 80 % of the total selenium.

Selenohomolanthionine escapes the current assays for the organic character of Se-rich yeast based on the protein-bound selenomethionine determination.

The activation of waste brewer's yeast resulted in the increased volume of developed gas in dough by 100 % compared to non-activated brewer's yeast, and the obtained bread is of more stable freshness compared to bread produced with baker's yeast. The activation of BY affects positively the quality of produced bread regarding bread volume. The volume of developed gas in dough prepared {{with the use of}} non-activated BY was not sufficient, therefore, it should not be used as fermentation agent, but only as an additive in bread production process for bread freshness preservation.

40|$|Chromium (Cr) nutriture was {{investigated}} in three related projects. A retrospective Cr assessment study was conducted utilizing dietary records, urine, and blood serum from young adults and pregnant adolescents. Average daily Cr intakes for all subjects was 37. 0 (mu) g. Differences in chromium status were not demonstrated in subjects from different geographic locations. Pregnant adolescents had marginal Cr intakes (48 (mu) g/day) and non-detectable levels of Cr in urine. Pregnancy may divert maternal Cr stores to the fetus. ^ Nortestosterone-derived oral contraceptive agents have the greatest capacity to alter glucose tolerance in women. Retired breeding female mice were fed either an oral contraceptive preparation or a Cr supplement in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. All mice gained weight regardless of experimental treatment. In addition, treatments did not affect percentage carcass fat or moisture. Glucose tolerance tests were conducted. Chromium supplementation appeared to moderate the glucose response at 40 minutes post-glucose injection as compared to non-Cr supplementation. ^ Organic Cr {{as a component of}} the glucose tolerance factor found in brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> is considered to be the most biologically available form of Cr. A five week study was employed to examine differences in bioavailability of inorganic and organic Cr supplements in midwestern women. Each woman serving as her own control randomly received the basal diet alone, basal diet + brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast,</b> and basal diet + chelated Cr. Mean urinary Cr excretion was similar for subjects consuming the basal diet alone or with the brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> supplement (0. 16 (mu) g/day). However, the pattern of urinary excretion was different. Brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> supplementation decreased variability in Cr excretion in comparison to values when either the basal diet was fed alone or supplemented with chelated Cr. Chelated Cr led to significantly higher urinary Cr excretion (P 3 ̆c 0. 03) than did either the basal diet alone or with brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> supplementation. This suggests that either the Cr supplied by chelated Cr was better absorbed than was that supplied by yeast, although both were apparently poorly absorbed in comparison to the Cr supplied by the diet, or that the absorbed chelated Cr was more poorly utilized than was the Cr from yeast. Blood serum Cr concentrations were not significantly changed throughout the experimental treatments, although the numerically highest mean blood serum Cr level was found when the brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> was fed. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{feedback}} optimization {{scheme for}} a fed-batch fermentation was developed. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{commonly known as}} baker 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast,</b> was chosen as a model system. ^ As {{the first part of}} the proposed feedback optimization scheme, open-loop optimization studies have been carried out for the fed-batch baker 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> culture. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed feedback optimization scheme could handle the situations in which there are uncertainties in initial conditions and system parameters. The feedback optimization scheme could even overcome the changes in substrate feed concentration. ^ A fully computerized fed-batch fermentation system has been built. It consisted of a 15 L fermentor equipped with a local controller; to which a microcomputer, on-line cell density measurement devices, and a feeding system were interfaced. A fermentor offgas line was connected to a mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was also interfaced to the microcomputer for control and data acquisition. ^ The feedback optimization scheme has been implemented in low and high cell density fed-batch baker 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> fermentations. The experimental results demonstrated the superiority of closed-loop implementation to the open-loop implementation for both low and high cell density runs. The performance indices in the closed-loop implementations were typically 10 - 20...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} approach to cycle-to-cycle optimization of fed-batch cultures {{for determining the}} optimal substrate feed strategies is developed. The proposed optimization strategy involves three key steps: developing a reliable mathematical model, computing the optimal control policy, and experimentally verifying {{the effectiveness of the}} optimal policy. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, more commonly known as baker 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast,</b> is chosen as a model system. ^ An unstructured model for aerobic growth of baker 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> is developed. An attractive feature of the model is that it accounts for three major metabolic pathways of yeast growth, yet it is simple enough to be used in optimization studies. The optimal glucose feed policy achieves a balance between the growth rate of yeast cells and the cellular yield on glucose. The optimal feed rate sequences are identified for four different initial culture conditions. ^ The optimal glucose feed policy is implemented in a computer controlled fermentor system. The parameters in the model are determined from the experimental data of one cycle. Then, the optimal glucose feed rate is computed and applied in the next cycle. The optimal results, obtained in two cycles of operation, show a 10 to 15...|$|R
