5|$|Following the {{scorched}} earth {{tactics of}} retreating Wehrmacht troops, large areas in Northern Norway {{needed to be}} rebuilt. In 1945, there was an overwhelming need for housing.

The resulting houses were Spartan and <b>broke</b> <b>with</b> building standards, but met an immediate need for shelter.|$|E
5|$|In his prime, Baxter {{was known}} for his ability to raise a team's morale, his good {{tactical}} vision, precise passing and ability to send opponents the wrong way – and for being a joker on the pitch.

5|$|The Welles Declaration linked U.S. {{policy towards}} the Baltic {{states with the}} Stimson Doctrine, which did not {{recognize}} Japanese, German and Italian occupations during the 1930s.

5|$|Before Wilhelm, the knuckleball was {{primarily}} mixed in to older pitchers' repertoires {{at the end}} of their careers to offset their slowing fastballs and to reduce stress on their arms, thereby extending their careers. Wilhelm <b>broke</b> <b>with</b> tradition when he began throwing the pitch as a teenager and threw it nearly every pitch. The New York Times linked his knuckleball with that of modern pitcher R.A. Dickey, as Wilhelm taught pitcher Charlie Hough the knuckleball in 1971, and Hough taught it to Dickey while coaching with the Texas Rangers.|$|E

The autonomists, an anarchist group associated with Josef Peukert, emphasized individual freedom. They feared the domination of the anarchist movement by a single individual and opposed the establishment of anarchist organizations. Consequently, the autonomists were opposed to Most. Soon, Berkman {{was working for the}} autonomists' publications, Der Anarchist and Die Autonomie, but he remained committed to the concept of violent action as a tool for inspiring revolutionary change.|$|E
5|$|Darejan and {{her party}} were resolutely opposed to George XII's renewed {{quest for the}} Russian protection.
