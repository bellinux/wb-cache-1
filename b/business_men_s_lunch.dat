5000|$|We say to {{you that}} you have made the {{definition}} of a <b>business</b> <b>man</b> too limited in its application. The man who is employed for wages is as much a <b>business</b> <b>man</b> as his employer; the attorney in a country town is as much a <b>business</b> <b>man</b> as the corporation counsel in a great metropolis; the merchant at the cross-roads store is as much a <b>business</b> <b>man</b> as the merchant of New York; the farmer who goes forth in the morning and toils all day, who begins in spring and toils all summer, and who by the application of brain and muscle to the natural resources of the country creates wealth, is as much a <b>business</b> <b>man</b> as the man who goes upon the Board of Trade and bets upon the price of grain; the miners who go down a thousand feet into the earth, or climb two thousand feet upon the cliffs, and bring forth from their hiding places the precious metals to be poured into the channels of trade are as much <b>business</b> <b>men</b> as the few financial magnates who, in a back room, corner the money of the world.
