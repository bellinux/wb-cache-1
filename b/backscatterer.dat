Another technique uses the time of arrival (TOA), when the time of transmission and speed of propagation are known. Combining TOA data from several receivers at different known locations (time difference of arrival, TDOA) can provide an estimate of position even in the absence of knowledge of the time of transmission. The angle of arrival (AOA) at a receiving station can be determined by the use of a directional antenna, or by differential time of arrival at an array of antennas with known location. AOA information may be combined with distance estimates from the techniques previously described to establish the location of a transmitter or <b>backscatterer.</b> Alternatively, the AOA at two receiving stations of known location establishes the position of the transmitter. The use of multiple receivers to locate a transmitter is known as multilateration.|$|E
40|$|Shot noise {{measurements}} were recently exploited {{to measure the}} charge of the quasiparticles in the Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) regime. For fractional filling factors nu= 1 / 3 and 2 / 5 of the first Landau level, fractional charges q=e/ 3 and e/ 5, respectively, were measured. We investigate here the interaction of e/ 3 quasiparticles with a strong <b>backscatterer</b> and find unexpected results. When a weak <b>backscatterer</b> is introduced {{in the path of}} an otherwise noiseless current of quasiparticles, stochastic partitioning of the quasiparticles takes place and shot noise proportional to their charge appears. Specifically, at nu= 1 / 3, noise corresponding to q=e/ 3 appears. However, the measured charge increases monotonically as backscattering becomes stronger, approaching asymptotically q=e. In other words, only electrons, or alternatively, three bunched quasiparticles, tunnel through high potential barriers when impinged by a noiseless current of quasiparticles. Here we show that such bunching of quasiparticles by a strong <b>backscatterer</b> depends on the average occupation (dilution) of the impinging quasiparticle current. For a very dilute impinging current, bunching ceases altogether and the transferred charge approaches q=e/ 3. These surprising results prove that a sparse beam of quasiparticles, each with charge e/ 3, tunnel through high potential barriers, originally thought to be opaque for them. Comment: 5 figure...|$|E

Detailed information about the exact interaction mechanisms including the structure and stoichiometry of the adsorption complexes is crucial to predict the retention behavior in diverse geochemical environments. Here, we investigated the structure of the neptunyl adsorption complex at the calcite-water interface at pH 8. 3 in equilibrium with air by means of low-temperature (15 K) EXAFS spectroscopy at the Np-L(III) edge. The coordination environment of neptunyl consists of two axial oxygen atoms at 1. 87 (± 0. 01) Å, and an equatorial oxygen shell of six atoms at 2. 51 (± 0. 01) Å. Two oxygen <b>backscatterers</b> at 3. 50 (± 0. 04) Å along with calcium <b>backscatterers</b> at 3. 95 (± 0. 03) Å suggest that neptunyl is linked to the calcite surface through two monodentate bonds towards carbonate groups of the calcite surface. Two additional carbon <b>backscatterers</b> at 2. 94 (± 0. 02) Å are attributed to two carbonate ions in bidentate coordination. This structural environment is conclusively interpreted as a ternary surface complex, where a neptunyl biscarbonato complex sorbs through two monodentate carbonate bonds to steps at the calcite (104) face, while the two bidentately coordinated carbonate groups point away from the surface. This structural information is further supported by Mixed Flow Reactor (MFR) experiments. They show a significant decrease of the calcite growth rate in the presence of neptunyl(V), in line with blockage of the most active crystal growth sites, step and kink sites, by adsorption of neptunyl.

Quantitative ultrasound techniques that relate lung tissue acoustic properties, i. e. acoustic velocity, attenuation, and scattering, to its physical properties, such as, elastic and structural properties, have been reviewed. B-mode techniques were equipment dependent and produced conflicting results. A-mode techniques are less dependent on the measuring equipment and could provide more accurate information about lung development. A-node techniques were applied {{to the study of}} regional differences within the fetal lung. The accuracy of these techniques could be instrumental to the eventual determination of lung maturation. To pursue this possibility, the alveolar regions across the upper, middle, and lower lobes of physiologically mature normal preterm lamb lungs were scanned to determine their acoustic properties within the frequency range of 1 - 15 MHz. Average speed of sound, attenuation and size of <b>backscatterers</b> were found to be independent of lung regions. Comparison between the lung mean size of <b>backscatterers</b> and mean alveolar sac diameter, histologically measured from the whole lung, showed that these data were not statistically different. This suggested that the collagen rich alveolar sac septal walls were the principal sources of scattering. Histological measurements on the size of alveolar sacs across different regions of the lung were also independent of the lung regions. The results of this study on the fetal lamb lungs suggested that A-mode ultrasound is sensitive to lung developmental changes. The ability of A-mode ultrasound to determine lung maturity appears promising.

We show that the QSH state persists in strong quantizing fields and is identified by counter-propagating (helical) edge channels with nonlinear dispersion inside the band gap. If the Fermi level is shifted into the Landau-quantized conduction or valence band, we find a transition between the QSH and QH regimes.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} theoretical investigation of transport through a {{single-walled carbon nanotube}} (SWNT) in good contact to metal leads where weak backscattering at the interfaces between SWNT and source and drain reservoirs gives rise to electronic Fabry-Perot (FP) oscillations in conductance and shot noise. We include the electron-electron interaction and the finite length of the SWNT within the inhomogeneous Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) model and treat the non-equilibrium effects due to an applied bias voltage within the Keldysh approach. In low-frequency transport properties, the TLL effect is apparent mainly via power-law characteristics {{as a function of}} bias voltage or temperature at energy scales above the finite level spacing of the SWNT. The FP-frequency is dominated by the non-interacting spin mode velocity due to two degenerate subbands rather than the interacting charge velocity. At higher frequencies, the excess noise is shown to be capable of resolving the splintering of the transported electrons arising from the mismatch of the TLL-parameter at the interface between metal reservoirs and SWNT. This dynamics leads to a periodic shot noise suppression as a function of frequency and with a period that is determined solely by the charge velocity. At large bias voltages, these oscillations are dominant over the ordinary FP-oscillations caused by two weak <b>backscatterers.</b> This makes shot noise an invaluable tool to distinguish the two mode velocities in the SWNT.

40|$|Calculations {{of light}} {{scattering}} by small particles {{are important in}} many diverse fields of science and engineering. In many cases of practical interest, scattering particles are nonspherical and are distributed over sizes and orientations. However, accurate light scattering computations for ensembles of nonspherical particles are difficult and time-consuming, and the literature in which such calculations are reported is rather scarce. In this paper, the T-matrix approach, as extended recently to randomly oriented particles, {{is used to calculate}} rigorously light scattering by size distributions of randomly oriented axially symmetric particles. To model the variation of particle sizes in real ensembles, we use a power law distribution typical of some terrestrial aerosols. Contour plots of intensity and degree of linear polarization for polydisperse prolate and oblate spheroids of different aspect ratios and effective equivalent-sphere size parameters from 0 to 10 are calculated and compared with calculations for equivalent spheres. The angular scattering behavior of nonspherical polydispersions is found to be greatly different from that of spheres, while the scattering properties of oblate and prolate spheroids of the same aspect ratio are similar. With increasing particle size, both intensity and polarization become more shape-dependent. In general, nonspherical particles are stronger side scatterers and weaker <b>backscatterers</b> than equivalent spheres. With increasing aspect ratio of nonspherical particles polarization tends to be predominantly positive.

40|$|In the {{processing}} of data acquired by conventional radar altimeters, algorithms designed to compute elevation of signal <b>backscatterers</b> assume that the point closest to the satellite antenna is the nadir point. While this is a valid assumption over the oceans, it is often not valid in non-oceanic surfaces. Radar altimetry data acquired over ice sheets, for instance, are dominated by multiple scatterers off-nadir to the satellite, which implies {{that more than one}} scattering surfaces in the radar footprint contribute to the received signal. A SAR/Interferometric Radar Altimeter, which is the primary payload of CryoSat, allows the geolocation of an off-nadir scatterer by recording the receiving signal in two distinct receiving antennae separated by a baseline of 1. 2 m. In recent studies on ice sheet elevation changes based on CryoSat data, however, only one scatterer is ‘tracked’. Hence, the full potential of the backscattered signal is not exploited. In this study, we design an algorithm that enables elevation estimation and geolocation of multiple off-nadir scatterers within the radar footprint from CryoSat Level 1 b waveforms. With the results obtained by our CryoSat level 2 data processor, we obtain elevation change measurements over a part of the Jakobshavn Isbræ (or the Jakobshavn drainage basin) at West-Greenland.

40|$|Studies on aerosol {{direct and}} {{indirect}} effects require a precise separation of cloud-free and cloudy air. However, separation between cloud-free and cloudy areas from remotely-sensed measurements is ambiguous. The transition zone in the regions around clouds often stretches out tens of km, which are neither precisely clear nor precisely cloudy. We study the transition zone between cloud-free and cloudy air using MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) measurements. Both instruments show enhanced clear-sky reflectance (MODIS) and clear-sky <b>backscatterer</b> (CALIPSO) near clouds, Analyzing a large dataset of MODIS observations we {{examine the effect of}} three-dimensional (3 D) radiative interactions between clouds and cloud-free areas, also known as a cloud adjacency effect. Comparing with CALIPSO clear-sky <b>backscatterer</b> measurements, we show that the cloud adjacency effect may be responsible for {{a large portion of the}} enhanced clear sky reflectance observed by MODIS. While aerosol particles are responsible for a large part of the near-cloud enhancements in CALIPSO observations, misidentified or undetected cloud particles are also likely to contribute. As a result, both the nature of these particles (cloud vs. aerosol) and the processes creating them need to be clarified using a quantitative assessment of remote sensing limitations in particle detection and identification. The width and ubiquity of the transition zone near clouds imply that studies of aerosol-cloud interactions and aerosol direct radiative effects need to account for aerosol changes near clouds. Not accounted, these changes can cause systematic biases toward smaller aerosol radiative forcing. On the other hand, including aerosol products near clouds despite their uncertainties may overestimate aerosol radiative forcing. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing methods that can assess and account for remote sensing challenges and thus allow for including the transition zone into the study. We describe a simple model that estimates the cloud-induced enhanced reflectances of cloud-free areas in the vicinity of clouds. The model assumes that the enhancement is due entirely to Rayleigh scattering and is therefore bigger at shorter wavelengths, thus creating a so-called apparent "bluing" of aerosols in remote sensing retrievals...|$|E

In high resolution SAR data of built-up areas, especially bright lines are a distinctive building feature. They are often caused by double reflection between ground and building wall. The appearance of such features depends on the illumination geometry, therefore the location of different building walls can be inferred from multi-aspect SAR imagery. Previous studies showed that especially the fusion of orthogonal viewing directions is beneficial with respect to the generation of rectangular building footprints. However, a comparison with cadastral data revealed that the footprints were often oversized. As a consequence, the building height estimates were too low, due to the presence of ground pixels inside the footprint hypotheses. This problem can be solved by investigation of interferometric phase profiles of layover and building roof areas. For this reason an algorithm was implemented to simulate interferometric phase data by taking into account that a mixture of several <b>backscatterers</b> may contribute to the phase value of a single range cell. These simulations are based on intermediate 3 D reconstruction results (i. e. building hypotheses). For this purpose, the geo-position of the building hypotheses and the sensor geometry have to be taken into account.

The well-documented integrated profiling technique (IPT), which uses a microwave profiler, a cloud radar, and a ceilometer to simultaneously retrieve vertical profiles of temperature, humidity, and liquid water content (LWC) of nonprecipitating clouds, is further developed toward an enhanced performance in the boundary layer and lower troposphere. For a more accurate temperature profile, this is accomplished by including an elevation scanning measurement modus of the microwave profiler. Height-dependent RMS accuracies of temperature (humidity) ranging from 0. 3 to 0. 9 K (0. 5 – 0. 8 g m− 3) in the boundary layer are derived from retrieval simulations and confirmed experimentally with measurements at distinct heights taken during the 2005 International Lindenberg Campaign for Assessment of Humidity and Cloud Profiling Systems and its Impact on High-Resolution Modeling (LAUNCH) of the German Weather Service. Temperature inversions, especially of the lower boundary layer, are captured in a very satisfactory way by using the elevation scanning mode.

As expected, the techniques suppressed the self-interference quite well (more than 70 dB) in an anechoic chamber, but scattering environments, the suppression was much less, (no more than 45 dB), {{due to the fact}} that passive techniques operate primarily on the direct path between the transmit and receive antennas, and do little to suppress paths that include an external <b>backscatterer.</b> The direct-path limitation of passive spatial isolation mechanisms raises the question of whether or not spatial isolation can be useful in a backscattering environment. Another class of spatial isolation techniques called “active” or “channel aware” spatial isolation [23] can indeed suppress both direct and backscattered self-interference. In particular, if multiple antennas are used and if the self-interference channel response can be estimated, then the radiation pattern can be shaped adaptively to mitigate both direct-path and backscattered self-interference. However, this pattern shaping (i.e., beamforming) will consume spatial degrees-of-freedom that could have otherwise been leveraged for spatial multiplexing. Thus, there is an important tradeoff between spatial self-interference isolation and achievable degrees of freedom.|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{algorithm}} for {{the reconstruction}} of elevation and material property maps of the seafloor using a sidescan sonar backscatter image and sparse bathymetric points co-registered within the image. Given a path for the sensor; the reconstruction is corrected for {{the movement of the}} fish during the image generation process. To perform reconstruction, an arbitrary but computable scattering model is assumed for the seapoor <b>backscatterer.</b> The algorithm uses the sparse bathymetric data to generate an initial estimate for the elevation map which is then iteratively refined to fit the backscatter image by minimizing a global error functional. Concurrently, the parameters of the scattering model are determined on a coarse grid in the image by fitting the assumed scattering model to the backscaner data. The elevation surface and the scattering parameter maps converge to their best fit shape and values given the backscatter data. The reconstruction is corrected for the movement of the sensor by initially doing local reconstructions in sensor coordinates and then transforming the local reconstructions to a global coordinate system and performing the reconstruction again. The algorithm supports different scattering models, so it can be applied to different underwater environments and sonar sensors. In addition to the elevation map of the seafloor, the parameters of the scattering model at every point in the image are generated. Since these parameters describe material properties of the seafloor; the maps of the scattering model parameters can be used to segment the seafloor by material type...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUltrasonic {{backscattered}} {{signals from}} blood contain frequency-dependent {{information that can}} be used to obtain quantitative parameters describing the aggregation state of red blood cells (RBCs). However the relation between the parameters describing the aggregation level and the <b>backscatterer</b> coefficient needs to be better clarified. For that purpose, numerical wave simulations were performed to generate backscattered signals that mimic the response of two-dimensional (2 D) RBC distributions to an ultrasound excitation. The simulated signals were computed with a time-domain method that has the advantages of requiring no physical approximations (within the framework of linear acoustics) and of limiting the numerical artefacts induced by the discretization of object interfaces. In the simple case of disaggregated RBCs, the relationship between the backscatter amplitude and scatterer concentration was studied. Backscatter coefficients (BSC) in the frequency range 10 to 20 MHz were calculated for weak scattering infinite cylinders (radius 2. 8 μm) at concentrations ranging from 6 to 36 %. At low concentration, the BSC increased with scatterer concentrations; at higher concentrations, the BSC reached a maximum and then decreased with increasing concentration, as it was noted by previous authors in in vitro blood experiments. In the case of aggregated RBCs, the relationship between the backscatter frequency dependence and level of aggregation at a concentration of 24 % was studied for a larger frequency band (10 - 50 MHz). All these results were compared with a weak scattering model based on the analytical computing of the structure factor...|$|E
40|$|Isoforms (1 - 4) {{of human}} {{tyrosine}} hydroxylase (TH) have been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as apoenzymes (metal-free). Apo-human TH binds 1. 0 atom Fe(II) /enzyme subunit, and iron binding {{is associated with}} an immediate and dramatic (40 -fold) increase in specific activity. For X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements the apoenzyme was reconstituted with 56 Fe and for Mossbauer measurements with 57 Fe. XAFS measurements at the Fe-K edge of human TH were performed on the native form [Fe(II) -human TH], as well as after addition of stoichiometric amounts of the substrate tetrahydropterin, the inhibitor dopamine and of H 2 O 2. The addition of dopamine or H 2 O 2 oxidizes the ferrous iron of the native human TH to the ferric state. In both redox states the iron is octahedrally coordinated by low-Z <b>backscatterers,</b> thus sulfur coordination can be excluded. From the multiple scattering analysis of the EXAFS region is was surmised {{that part of the}} iron coordination is due to (3 ± 1) imidazols. Addition of tetrahydropterin does not significantly change the iron coordination of the Fe(II) enzyme. The Mössbauer results confirm the valence states and the octahedral coordination of iron as well as the exclusion of sulfur ligation. Both the EPR spectra and the Mossbauer magnetic hyperfine pattern of dopamine- and H 2 O 2 -treated native human TH, were analyzed with the spin-Hamiltonian formalism. This analysis provides significantly different features for the two forms of human TH: the ferric iron (S= 5 / 2) of the H 2 O 2 -treated form exhibits a rhombic environment while that of the dopamine-treated form exhibits near-axial symmetry. The specific spectroscopic signature of dopamine-treated human TH, including that of an earlier resonance-Raman study [Michaud-Soret, I., Andersson, K. K., Que, L. Jr & Haavik, J. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 5504 – 5510] is most likely due to the Biolentate binding of dopamine to iron...|$|R

[...] Symposium on Integrating New Advances in Mediterranean Oceanography and Marine Biology, 26 - 29 November 2013, Institut de Ciències del Mar (CSIC), Barcelona, Catalunya, SpainA pilot {{experiment}} aiming at investigating the nepheloid and dynamical structures over the Barcelona continental slope in the Besòs submarine canyon {{was carried out}} by using the new moored profiler “Aqualog”. The mooring was deployed at the depth of 808 m at the canyon axis on 23 March 2012 and included also two current meters with turbidimeters at fixed depths. The profiler moved down and up along the line from 60 to 792 m every 4 hours at a speed of 0. 17 - 0. 18 m/s. The profiler carried an acoustic Doppler current meter, a CTD probe and a turbidimeter. Pressure, conductivity, temperature and turbidity were measured every second, while the vertical resolution of the current velocity and the acoustic backscatter was about 1. 05 m. The profiler operated until April 3. The profiling and fixed current meters data showed very good correlation both for speed and direction. The current speed usually differed by less than 0. 02 m/s within the subsurface layer at 40 - 80 m depth. At 4 - 5 m above the bottom, the flow often was 1. 5 - 2 times stronger than at 13 m above. No evidence of the bottom Ekman spiral was observed; at the depths of 790 - 792 m and 803 - 804 m, the currents were usually directed coherently either northwestward or southeastward. The nepheloid structure became evident in the acoustic backscatter profiles. The vertical distribution of acoustic backscatter was in agreement with the turbidity profile, being at minimum in the cold intermediate layer. The lower boundary of this layer underwent huge oscillations with amplitude of up to 250 m. The amount of the sound <b>backscatterers</b> suspended in the water was usually largest at 400 - 600 m depth. Several times the amount of the suspended sediments increased for 12 h or so at 600 - 800 m depth.

40|$|In this report, {{the authors}} {{summarize}} {{the research that}} has taken place during the second year of the 3 -year project. This project is being carried out at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory. The original intent in this project was to use high-energy EXAFS to obtain information on the chemical state of the {sup 137 }Ba in pollucite without opening the stainless steel capsules. Using this approach, the authors hoped to avoid changing the chemical state of the {sup 137 }Ba. To evaluate the extent to which high-energy EXAFS data can be interpreted, the authors analyzed a number of Cs and Ba standards in addition to Ba-doped pollucite samples. The standards included a variety of structures from simple oxides and halides to titanates and silicates. While the EXAFS signal from the simple oxides and halides were low in amplitude the analysis of the EXAFS and the Fourier transforms resulted in reasonable data. The authors obtained extremely weak EXAFS signals from the more complex silicates and titanates with distant first neighbor atoms. In addition, the amplitudes of the Cs K-edge EXAFS are about half as intense as the corresponding Ba K-edge EXAFS (Figure 1). Several factors {{may have contributed to the}} apparent differences between the Cs and Ba K-edge data, such as core-hole lifetime broadening, weak photoelectron backscatters, and low charge density of the large low-valence cations. Also, long interatomic distances appear as low frequency oscillations in the XAS and these features could have been inadvertently removed when they tried to extract the EXAFS. Artifacts that have no possible structural origin often dominated the Fourier transforms from these compounds. A number of signal processing techniques were employed in an attempt to minimize these artifacts but they generally resulted in severe distortions of the weak EXAFS signal. Regardless of the specific origin, these factors reduce the extent to which the Cs K-edge EXAFS data can be interpreted. The authors conclude that Cs and Ba K-edge EXAFS can be used successfully for materials where the structure is relatively simple and the material is well ordered. However, in materials with low atomic number <b>backscatterers</b> and low symmetry such as pollucite, it is not possible to determine the effects of {sup 137 }Cs beta decay and transmutation on the pollucite structure. However, one can reasonably hope to identify the presence of metallic Ba clusters or BaO, if either are the result of transmutation. To overcome the shortcomings with the high-energy EXAFS, they have explored the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to examine the local structure of the cesium in some laboratory-prepared pollucite. Small quantities, typical of what they expect to recover from the sealed capsules, proved to be sufficient material to obtain spectra with both magic-angle spinning and static NMR techniques (Figure 2). The chemical shift is expected to be sensitive to local structure and to disorder. They expect to prepare a sample from the {sup 137 }Cs pollucite when the authors open a capsule. ...|$|R
