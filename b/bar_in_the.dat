The potential impacts on the natural environment, regional economy, tourism, and resident population were considered, with particular concern for the crossing of the Hamersley Range.|$|E

40|$|We use {{a recent}} {{near-infrared}} imaging survey of samples of Seyfert and normal galaxies to study <b>the</b> role of <b>bars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fueling of nuclear activity. The active galaxy sample includes Seyfert galaxies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Revised Shapely-Ames (RSA) and Sandage & Tammann's (1987) extension to this catalog. The normal galaxies {{were selected to}} match <b>the</b> Seyfert sample <b>in</b> Hubble type, redshift, inclination and blue luminosity. All <b>the</b> galaxies <b>in</b> both samples classified as <b>barred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> RSA catalog are also <b>barred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near-infrared. <b>In</b> addition, ~ 55 % of the galaxies classified as non-barred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> RSA show evidence for bars at 2. 1 microns. Overall, ~ 70 % of the galaxies observed show evidence for bar structures. <b>The</b> incidence of <b>bars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Seyfert and normal galaxies is similar, suggesting Seyfert nuclei do not occur preferentially <b>in</b> <b>barred</b> systems. Furthermore, a slightly higher percentage of normal galaxies have multiple-bar structures. Comment: aastex 4. 0, accepted for publication <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Astrophysical Journal Letter...|$|R

5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said {{by some to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the <b>bar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him.|$|E

Gretta is a young and fiercely independent songwriter who has just broken up with her long-time boyfriend and songwriting partner Dave Kohl (Adam Levine), a newly successful musician who had an affair with one of his producers' assistants. Captivated by Gretta's music, Dan offers her to sign her to his former record label, and although she initially refuses she reconsiders the offer and agrees.|$|E

Although {{in more recent}} years Broad St has lost its popularity due to the closing of several clubs, the Arcadian now has more popularity in terms of nightlife.

The Medicine <b>Bar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Custard Factory, hmv Institute, Rainbow Pub and Air are large clubs and bars in Digbeth.

There are a number of late night pubs in the Irish Quarter. Outside the city centre is Star City entertainment complex on the former site of Nechells Power Station.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{the partial}} {{pressure}} of the inert gas component of the breathing mixture will accelerate decompression as the concentration gradient will be greater for a given depth. This is achieved by increasing the fraction of oxygen in the breathing gas used, whereas substitution of a different inert gas will not produce the desired effect. Any substitution may introduce counter-diffusion complications, owing to differing rates of diffusion of the inert gases, {{which can lead to}} a net gain in total dissolved gas tension in a tissue. This can lead to bubble formation and growth, with decompression sickness as a consequence. Partial pressure of oxygen is usually limited to 1.6 bar during in water decompression for scuba divers, but can be up to 1.9 bar in-water and 2.2 <b>bar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chamber when using the US Navy tables for surface decompression, and up to 2.8 bar for therapeutic decompression.|$|E

5|$|The player {{character}} {{is equipped with}} an energy shield which nullifies damage from weapons fire and forceful impacts. The shield's charge appears as a blue <b>bar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corner of the game's heads-up display, and it automatically recharges if no damage is sustained for a brief period. When the shield is fully depleted, the player is highly vulnerable, and further damage reduces the hit points of a secondary health meter. When this health meter reaches zero, the character dies and the game reloads from a saved checkpoint. Health can be replenished through the collection of health packs scattered around the game's levels, but the game's introduction of a regenerating shield mechanic represented a departure from FPS games of the time.|$|E
