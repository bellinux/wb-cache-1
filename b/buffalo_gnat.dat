50|$|The University of Georgia {{claims that}} {{there exists a}} biting kind of gnats, which is a black fly (<b>buffalo</b> <b>gnat).</b> The {{scientists}} compare the painful and vicious bite of the black fly with the fire ant bite. Meanwhile, the North Carolina State University entomologists explain that a widely spread type of biting flies, called biting midges, also belongs to the gnat species: “Biting midges (Culicoides sp.) are small, sometimes barely visible, blood-sucking flies more commonly known in many areas as biting gnats, sand flies, biting midges, punkies or “no-see-ums”.|$|E
50|$|A {{black fly}} (sometimes called a Blandford fly, <b>buffalo</b> <b>gnat,</b> turkey gnat, or white socks) is {{any member of}} the family Simuliidae of the Culicomorpha infraorder. They are related to the Ceratopogonidae, Chironomidae, and Thaumaleidae. Over 1,800 species of black flies are known (of which 11 are extinct). Most species belong to the immense genus Simulium. Most black flies gain {{nourishment}} by feeding on the blood of mammals, including humans, although the males feed mainly on nectar. They are usually small, black or gray, with short legs, and antennae. They are a common nuisance for humans, and many U.S. states have programs to suppress the black fly population. They spread several diseases, including river blindness in Africa (Simulium damnosum and S. neavei) and the Americas (S. callidum and S. metallicum in Central America, S. ochraceum in Central and South America).|$|E
60|$|Skirting {{along the}} north fork {{for a day or}} two, {{excessively}} annoyed by musquitoes and <b>buffalo</b> <b>gnats,</b> they reached, in the evening of the 17th, a small but beautiful grove, from which issued the confused notes of singing birds, the first they had heard since crossing the boundary of Missouri. After so many days of weary travelling through a naked, monotonous and silent country, it was delightful once more to hear the song of the bird, and to behold the verdure of the grove. It was a beautiful sunset, and a sight of the glowing rays, mantling the tree-tops and rustling branches, gladdened every heart. They pitched their camp in the grove, kindled their fires, partook merrily of their rude fare, and resigned themselves to the sweetest sleep they had enjoyed since their outset upon the prairies.|$|R
40|$|With {{a view to}} {{determining}} the mode of infection in Carrion's disease, {{a study of the}} blood-sucking insects found in the districts of Peru where the disease prevails has been carried out, through the cooperation of The Rockefeller Institute and the Rockefeller Foundation. The material studied included ticks, mites, midges, lice, fleas, bedbugs, mosquitoes, <b>buffalo</b> <b>gnats,</b> horse-flies, "sheep ticks," 3 species of Streblidae, and 3 species of Phlebotomus, including Phlebotomus verrucarum Townsend and two new species which have been named Phlebotomus noguchii and Phlebotomus peruensis. The insects were collected without the use of chemicals, were prepared for transportation in such a manner as to prevent drying, and were shipped under conditions of refrigeration to New York, where they were inoculated into monkeys. The plan followed was to inject saline suspensions of the crushed insects intradermally into rhesus monkeys and to make cultures of the blood of the animals at intervals of 1 to 6 weeks after inoculation. The only class of insects in which the presence of Bartonella bacilliformis could be detected were phlebotomi. No cutaneous lesions were induced in monkeys injected with the crushed insects, {{but in the case of}} four different lots of phlebotomi the blood of the animals so injected yielded cultures of Bartonella bacilliformis which produced typical verrucous lesions on inoculation into other monkeys. The morphology and cultural characteristics of the Bartonella strains obtained from phlebotomi proved identical with those of strains isolated from human blood and skin lesions. Monkeys which had recovered from infection with the phlebotomus strains resisted inoculation with a human strain of Bartonella bacilliformis, and, conversely, monkeys which had passed through an infection induced by the human strain resisted inoculation with the strains obtained from phlebotomi. The experimental observations described in this paper lead us to conclude that certain phlebotomi act as insect vectors of Oroya fever and verruga peruana. The phlebotomi which have been shown quite certainly to carry the Bartonella bacilliformis are those of the species Phlebotomus noguchii. Phlebotomus verrucarum is also probably a vector, while Phlebotomus peruensis remains doubtful in this respect...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Florida {{occasionally}} experiences {{outbreaks of}} black flies, {{though this is}} a rare occurance, and these large populations are caused by rainfall extremes. Common names for this pest include black flies and turkey gnats, {{as well as a}} number of new names applied by Floridians which are not repeatable here. Because of the hump visible behind their head when viewed in profile, black flies are also called <b>buffalo</b> <b>gnats.</b> Like eye gnats, they fly around people 2 ̆ 7 s heads, occasionally getting into eyes and ears as well as crawling in the hair. Because most of the specimens collected to date have been identified as Simulium slossonae Dyar 2 ̆ 6 Shannon, biological information given below will generally be for this species. Black flies are found in many parts of the US and Canada, including Florida. Populations in Florida normally are not present in numbers large enough to be noticed by humans. Simulium slossonae is found in Florida from Dade country north to Duval county, and west to Escambia county. In some areas it is present all year long. In South Carolina, population peaks have been recorded in late July, late September, and late October, but large numbers have been found in Florida between April and November. Overall, Florida has 18 different black fly species, the most common with populations present from August through July. Only female black flies feed on blood. Males feed mainly on nectar. Black flies can occur in enormous numbers. Immature stages develop in oxygenated water sources, therefore adults are usually associated with slow moving streams, creeks, or rivers where the immature stages develop. Flowing water does not necessarily imply white water rapids, but water must be moving. Water in lakes and ponds that is not flowing is unsuitable for black fly development. S. slossonae prefers fairly small, slow moving streams with an average velocity of 1. 5 ft per second. Water is often tea-colored, with ample vegetation, light shade, and a pH of 4. 4 to 4. 5. S. slossonae makes good use of temporary streams that flow seasonally...|$|R
