40|$|An important, yet poorly {{quantified}} {{mechanism to}} explain the failure of some exotic species to increase and spread is that indigenous natural enemies provide ecosystem resistance to invasiveness.

40|$|In recent years, {{agricultural}} producers and non-governmental organizations and agencies have restored thousands of hectares of cropland to grassland in the Great Plains of the United States. However, {{little is known}} about the relationships between richness and seeding density in these restorations and resistance to invasive plant species. We assessed the effects of richness and seeding density on resistance to invasive and other unseeded plant species in experimental tallgrass prairie plots in central Nebraska. In 2006, twenty-four 55 m × 55 m plots were planted with six replicates in each of four treatments: high richness (97 species typically planted by The Nature Conservancy), at low and high seeding densities, and low richness (15 species representing a typical Conservation Reserve Program mix, CP 25), at low and high seeding densities. There was a significant negative relationship between richness and basal cover of unseeded perennial forbs/legumes and unseeded perennial/annual grasses, abundance of <b>bull</b> <b>thistle</b> (Cirsium vulgare), and the number of inflorescences removed from smooth brome (Bromus inermis) transplants. Invasion resistance may have been higher in the high richness treatments because of the characteristics of the dominant species in these plots or because of greater interspecific competition for limiting resources among forbs/legumes with neighboring plants belonging to the same functional group. Seeding density was not important in affecting invasion resistance, except in the cover of unseeded grasses.

Please {{look for}} {{up-to-date}} {{information in the}} OSU Extension Catalog: [URL] thistle is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It probably was introduced in eastern North America during colonial times, as a contaminant in seed or ship ballast. It is now the most widespread of the thistles in the United States (Figure 3, next page) and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and burned or newly logged forests. It invades a variety of habitats where it displaces native plants by out competing them for water, nutrients, and space.

40|$|The <b>bull</b> <b>thistle,</b> Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten. {{is listed}} as a noxious weed in Ontario and in Australia. It is {{widespread}} and found in many disturbed habitats such as roadsides, quarries, construction sites and pastures. Successful weeds are considered to demonstrate, among others, the following features: {{the production of a}} large number of small seeds, long-lived seeds, the presence of an efficient dispersal mechanism, and self-compatibility. Although seed production is substantial and Cirsium vulgare is self-compatible, the species has several characteristics that should constrain its demographic success. Seed dispersal is limited and in past studies, this species had been dismissed as only having a persistent seed bank at depths of 15 cm. Furthermore, seeds do not show innate dormancy and are capable of germinating under light or dark conditions. I have shown that seeds can acquire an induced light requirement for germination under certain simulated overwintering conditions. Furthermore, this species is capable of forming a persistent seed bank at a depth of 3 cm or at the soil surface in highly vegetated areas. This is fortuitous, since the <b>bull</b> <b>thistle,</b> a monocarpic perennial, cannot reproduce in arable situations where the soil is cultivated on a yearly basis. Preliminary observations of unusually coloured (black) seeds from some populations in southwestern Ontario led to the development of the present investigation. Genetic polymorphism for seed colour is described for the first time. Most plants produce the typical seed as characterized in the literature, yellow or gray with longitudinal dark striae. Black-seeded plants were observed in three of the four populations surveyed in southwestern Ontario. The frequency in these three populations ranged from 1. 2 % to 8. 3 %. Chemical assays showed that the total phenolic content is not associated with seed colour, but only black seeds contain tannin. Black seeds may act as allelopathic agents. Preliminary experiments show that extracts from black seed coats may inhibit germination and reduce the germination rate in other plant species...|$|E
40|$|A current {{challenge}} in ecology is {{to better understand}} the magnitude, variation, and interaction in the factors that limit the invasiveness of exotic species. We conducted a factorial experiment involving herbivore manipulation (insecticide-in-water vs. water-only control) and seven densities of introduced nonnative Cirsium vulgare (<b>bull</b> <b>thistle)</b> seed. The experiment was repeated with two seed cohorts at eight grassland sites uninvaded by C. vulgare in the central Great Plains, USA. Herbivory by native insects significantly reduced thistle seedling density, causing the largest reductions in density at the highest propagule inputs. The magnitude of this herbivore effect varied widely among sites and between cohort years. The combination of herbivory and lower propagule pressure increased the rate at which new C. vulgare populations failed to establish during the initial stages of invasion. This experiment demonstrates that the interaction between biotic resistance by native insects, propagule pressure, and spatiotemporal variation in their effects were crucial to the initial invasion by this Eurasian plant in the western tallgrass prairie...|$|E
