5|$|On 24 November 1939, Hanbury Brown wrote a memo on Suggestions for Fighter Control by RDF {{calling for}} {{a new type of}} radar that would {{directly}} display both the target aircraft and the intercepting fighter, allowing ground controllers to directly control the fighter without need for interpretation. The solution was to mount a radar on a motorized platform so it rotated continually, sweeping the entire sky. A motor in the CRT display would rotate the <b>beam</b> <b>deflection</b> plates in synchronicity, so blips seen when the antenna was at a particular angle would be displayed at the same angle on the scope display. Using a phosphor that lasted at least one rotation, blips for all targets within range would be drawn on the display at their correct relative angles, producing a map-like image known as a PPI. With both the bombers and fighters now appearing on the same display, the radar operator could now direct an intercept directly, eliminating all of the delays.|$|E
25|$|They draw {{graphics}} point-to-point, {{rather than}} scanning a raster. Either monochrome or color CRTs {{can be used}} in vector displays, and the essential principles of CRT design and operation are the same for either type of display; the main difference is in the <b>beam</b> <b>deflection</b> patterns and circuits.|$|E
25|$|Some {{otherwise}} conventional tubes do {{not fall}} into standard categories; the 6AR8, 6JH8 and 6ME8 had several common grids, followed {{by a pair of}} <b>beam</b> <b>deflection</b> electrodes which deflected the current towards either of two anodes. It was sometimes known as the 'sheet beam' tube, and was used in some color TV sets for color demodulation. The similar 7360 was popular as a balanced SSB (de)modulator.|$|E

5000|$|Typically, {{for very}} small <b>beam</b> <b>deflections</b> {{electrostatic}} deflection [...] "lenses" [...] are used, larger <b>beam</b> <b>deflections</b> require electromagnetic scanning. Because of the inaccuracy {{and because of}} the finite number of steps in the exposure grid the writing field is of the order of 100 micrometre - 1 mm. Larger patterns require stage moves. An accurate stage is critical for stitching (tiling writing fields exactly against each other) and pattern overlay (aligning a pattern to a previously made one).|$|R
25|$|Dynamic color {{convergence}} and purity {{are one of}} {{the main}} reasons why until late in their history, CRTs were long-necked (deep) and had biaxially curved faces; these geometric design characteristics are necessary for intrinsic passive dynamic color convergence and purity. Only starting around the 1990s did sophisticated active dynamic convergence compensation circuits become available that made short-necked and flat-faced CRTs workable. These active compensation circuits use the deflection yoke to finely adjust <b>beam</b> <b>deflection</b> according to the beam target location. The same techniques (and major circuit components) also make possible the adjustment of display image rotation, skew, and other complex raster geometry parameters through electronics under user control.|$|E
2500|$|The {{solution}} to the static convergence and purity problems {{is a set of}} color alignment magnets installed around the neck of the CRT. These movable weak permanent magnets are usually mounted on the back end of the deflection yoke assembly and are set at the factory to compensate for any static purity and convergence errors that are intrinsic to the unadjusted tube. Typically there are two or three pairs of two magnets in the form of rings made of plastic impregnated with a magnetic material, with their magnetic fields parallel to the planes of the magnets, which are perpendicular to the electron gun axes. Each pair of magnetic rings forms a single effective magnet whose field vector can be fully and freely adjusted (in both direction and magnitude). By rotating a pair of magnets relative to each other, their relative field alignment can be varied, adjusting the effective field strength of the pair. (As they rotate relative to each other, each magnet's field can be considered to have two opposing components at right angles, and these four components [...] form two pairs, one pair reinforcing each other and the other pair opposing and canceling each other. Rotating away from alignment, the magnets' mutually reinforcing field components decrease as they are traded for increasing opposed, mutually cancelling components.) By rotating a pair of magnets together, preserving the relative angle between them, the direction of their collective magnetic field can be varied. Overall, adjusting all of the convergence/purity magnets allows a finely tuned slight electron <b>beam</b> <b>deflection</b> or lateral offset to be applied, which compensates for minor static convergence and purity errors intrinsic to the uncalibrated tube. Once set, these magnets are usually glued in place, but normally they can be freed and readjusted in the field (e.g. by a TV repair shop) if necessary.|$|E

40|$|Exact {{expressions}} {{are presented}} for the deflection of {{a laser beam}} passing parallel to and above {{the surface of a}} sample heated by a periodically modulated axisymmetric laser beam. The sample may consist of any number of planar films on a thick substrate. These exact expressions are derived from a local Green’s function treatment of the heat conduction equation, and contain an exact analytical treatment of the absorption of energy in the multilayered system from the heating laser. The method is based on calculation of the normal component of the heat fluxes across the layer boundaries, from which either the <b>beam</b> <b>deflections</b> or the temperature anywhere in space can be easily found. A central part of the calculation is a tridiagonal matrix equation for the N + 1 normal boundary fluxes, where N equals the number of films in the sample, with the <b>beam</b> <b>deflections</b> given as simple functions of the normal heat flux through the top surface of the sample. Even though any layer or layers in the sample (including the substrate) can be optically absorbing, the final results are remarkably simple both in form and ease of calculation, even for large numbers of layers. In the case of an infinitesimal probe <b>beam,</b> the <b>beam</b> <b>deflections</b> are given by an expression involving a single numerical integration which can be eliminated for data analysis by Fourier transforming the experimental data. A general expression for the measured signals for the case of four-quadrant detection is also presented and compared to previous calculations of detector response for finite probe beams...|$|R

The <b>beam</b> <b>deflections</b> were driven by magnetic coils, and those coils fought against rapid changes to their current. The screen flickered when filled with more than 800 inches of lines or more than 1200 characters, because the beam then needed more than 1/40th of a second to retrace everything.|$|R
30|$|Various models {{integrating}} the tension stiffening effect {{have been proposed}} to design RC structures. Among models, we can quote the model of Branson (1968), which represents the tension stiffening effect using an equivalent moment of inertia of the cracked section of the beam.
