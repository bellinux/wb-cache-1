5|$|Throughout {{the period}} {{following}} {{the collapse of}} the USSR, crews on Mir experienced occasional reminders of the economic chaos occurring in Russia. The initial cancellation of Spektr and Priroda was the first such sign, followed by the reduction in communications {{as a result of the}} fleet of tracking ships being withdrawn from service by Ukraine. The new Ukrainian government also vastly raised the price of the Kurs docking systems, manufactured in Kievthe Russians' attempts to reduce their dependence on Kurs would later lead to accidents during TORU tests in 1997. Various Progress spacecraft had parts of their cargoes missing, either because the consumable in question had been unavailable, or because the ground crews at Baikonur had, in desperation, looted them. The problems became particularly obvious during the launch of the EO-14 crew aboard Soyuz TM-17 in July; shortly before launch there was a <b>black-out</b> at the pad, and the entire power supply to the nearby city of Leninsk failed an hour after launch. Nevertheless, the spacecraft launched on time and arrived at the station two days later. All of Mirs ports were occupied, and so Soyuz TM-17 had to station-keep 200 metres away from the station for half an hour before docking whilst Progress M-18 vacated the core module's front port and departed.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War {{hundreds}} of Somerset soldiers were killed, and war memorials were {{put up in}} most of the towns and villages; only a few villages escaped casualties. There were also casualties– though much fewer– during the Second World War, who were added to the memorials. The county was a base for troops preparing for the 1944 D-Day landings, and some Somerset hospitals still date partly from that time. The Royal Ordnance Factory ROF Bridgwater was constructed early in World War II for the Ministry of Supply. It was designed as an Explosive ROF, to produce RDX, which was then a new experimental high-explosive. It obtained water supplies from two sources via the Somerset Levels: the artificial Huntspill River which was dug during the construction of the factory and also from the King's Sedgemoor Drain, which was widened at the same time. The Taunton Stop Line was set up to resist a potential German invasion, and the remains of its pill boxes can still be seen, as well as others along the coast. A decoy town was constructed on Black Down, intended to represent the blazing lights of a town which had neglected to follow the <b>black-out</b> regulations. Sites in the county housed Prisoner of War camps including: Norton Fitzwarren, Barwick, Brockley, Goathurst and Wells. Various airfields were built or converted from civilian use including: RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II), RAF Weston-super-Mare, RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron), Yeovil/Westland Airport, RAF Weston Zoyland, RAF Merryfield, RAF Culmhead and RAF Charmy Down.|$|E

25|$|When the Sun is active, strong solar flares {{can occur}} that {{will hit the}} sunlit side of Earth with hard X-rays. The X-rays will {{penetrate}} to the D-region, releasing electrons that will rapidly increase absorption, causing a high frequency (3–30nbsp&MHz) radio blackout. During this time very low frequency (3–30nbsp&kHz) signals will be reflected by the D layer instead of the E layer, where the increased atmospheric density will usually increase the absorption of the wave and thus dampen it. As soon as the X-rays end, the sudden ionospheric disturbance (SID) or radio <b>black-out</b> ends as the electrons in the D-region recombine rapidly and signal strengths return to normal.|$|E
25|$|At the Australian Open Li Na easily stormed {{through to}} the quarterfinals, where she faced world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwańska, who had not dropped a set during a 13-match winning streak. Li became {{the first player to}} defeat her this season and {{advanced}} to the semifinals where she ousted world No. 2 Maria Sharapova in straight sets, who had only dropped a record-low nine games in the tournament. This marked Li's second Australian Open final appearance in three years, finishing runner-up to Kim Clijsters in 2011. In the final, Li was hampered by injuries, falling over on two occasions. The first of which occurred at 1–3 in the second set, a fall that saw Li incur a 10-minute medical timeout. She fell over a second time after the Australia Day fireworks break, not only twisting her left ankle once more but also heavily knocking the rear of her head on the court, causing a momentary <b>black-out.</b> Despite being severely hindered in her movement, she continued playing but eventually lost the match in three sets to Victoria Azarenka.|$|E
25|$|State Guards were {{reformed}} {{for internal}} security duties {{to replace the}} National Guardsmen who were federalized and sent overseas. The Civil Air Patrol was established, which enrolled civilian spotters in air reconnaissance, search-and-rescue, and transport. Its Coast Guard counterpart, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, used civilian boats and crews in similar rescue roles. Towers were built in coastal and border towns, and spotters were trained to recognize enemy aircraft. Blackouts were practiced in every city, even those far from the coast. All exterior lighting had to be extinguished, and <b>black-out</b> curtains placed over windows. The main purpose was {{to remind people that}} there was a war on and to provide activities that would engage the civil spirit of millions of people not otherwise involved in the war effort. In large part, this effort was successful, sometimes almost to a fault, such as the Plains states where many dedicated aircraft spotters took up their posts night after night watching the skies in an area of the country that no enemy aircraft of that time could possibly hope to reach.|$|E

25|$|The {{operation}} H-Hour was set {{at midnight}} of the 11th. Led by Maj Sheonan Singh, the first stick of forty Paras were inserted in the first flight of two Mi-8s. The formation, led by Wg Cdr Sapre and Sqn Ldr Vinayraj as number two, approached the drop zone in low visibility observing complete <b>black-out.</b> The flights had only their formation lights—situated {{on top of the}} tail boom—switched on. These were turned off as the flight entered its short finals. Because of this complete blackout, the direction of approach of the first flights was missed by the Tigers. The two helicopters therefore entered the landing ground unopposed. However, as the commandos disgorged and moved to take defensive positions, they were pinned down by sustained fire from the Tiger positions. Both Sapre and Vinayraj's flight came under fire as they took off on full power, but did not suffer any hits. Under heavy fire, the paras were unable to mark the drop-zone in time for the next stick. As the second flight approached the dropzone, the pilots Flt Lt V Prakash and Sqn Ldr Duraiswami could identify the flashes of small arms fire and grenades. However, added to this, the tracers from the SLAF gunship detailed for the diversionary attack were also identified as groundfire. The pilots, unable to identify the dropzone after considerable efforts, aborted the mission. The paras on the ground were by this time nearly completely encircled by the Tigers.|$|E
500|$|Flying at , {{the pilot}} located his target through a bombsight {{window in the}} cockpit floor. The pilot moved the dive lever to the rear, {{limiting}} the [...] "throw" [...] of the control column. The dive brakes were activated automatically, the pilot set the trim tabs, reduced his throttle and closed the coolant flaps. The aircraft then rolled 180°, automatically nosing the aircraft into a dive. Red tabs protruded from the upper surfaces of the wing as a visual indicator to the pilot that, {{in case of a}} g-induced <b>black-out,</b> the automatic dive recovery system would be activated. The Stuka dived at a 60-90° angle, holding a constant speed of 500–600km/h (350-370mph) due to dive-brake deployment, which increased the accuracy of the Ju 87's aim.|$|E

500|$|Heffron also {{clashed with}} the Federal Government's {{imposition}} of National Emergency Services procedures, most notably over the imposition of brownouts {{for the city of}} Sydney. In the Legislative Assembly in November 1942, Heffron denounced the advisers of the Federal Government who continued to maintain the brown-out as an essential defence measure: [...] "The only conclusion I can come to, is that the brown-out was born of a form of panic when Japan entered the war and it has continued because of a few brass hats will not look at the facts and the evidence of the fighting men, but persist in sticking to their first conclusion. The position, therefore, is ludicrous." [...] Heffron later affirmed that the brown-out was completely unnecessary as a <b>black-out,</b> with short notice given, was a more effective and safer defensive measure.|$|E
500|$|Extensive {{tests were}} {{carried out by the}} Junkers works at their Dessau plant. It was {{discovered}} that the highest load a pilot could endure was 8.5 g for three seconds, when the aircraft was pushed to its limit by the centrifugal forces. At less than 4 g, no visual problems or loss of consciousness were experienced. Above 6 g, 50% of pilots suffered visual problems, or [...] "grey" [...] out. With 40%, vision vanished altogether from 7.5 g upwards and <b>black-out</b> sometimes occurred. Despite this blindness, the pilot could maintain consciousness and was capable of [...] "bodily reactions". However, after more than three seconds, half the subjects passed out. The pilot would regain consciousness two or three seconds after the centrifugal forces had dropped below 3 g and had lasted no longer than three seconds. In a crouched position, pilots could withstand 7.5 g and were able to remain functional for a short duration. In this position, Junkers concluded that ⅔ of pilots could withstand 8 g and perhaps 9 g for three to five seconds without vision defects which, under war conditions, was acceptable.|$|E
