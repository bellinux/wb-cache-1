40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between jet power and accretion for Fermi and non-Fermi <b>blazars,</b> respectively. We also compare the relevant parameter between them. Our main results are as follows. (i) Fermi and non-Fermi <b>blazars</b> have significant difference in redshift, black hole mass, and broad line luminosity. (ii) Fermi <b>blazars</b> have higher average core-dominance parameter than non-Fermi <b>blazars,</b> which suggests that Fermi <b>blazars</b> have strong beaming effect. (iii) We find significant correlation between broad line emission and jet power for Fermi and non-Fermi <b>blazars,</b> respectively, which suggests a direct tight connection between jet and accretion. (iv) The accretion and black hole mass may have a different contribution to jet power for Fermi and non-Fermi <b>blazars,</b> respectively.

40|$|Abstract We {{selected}} 457 <b>blazars</b> (193 flat spectrum radio quasars, 61 low-synchrotron peaked <b>blazars,</b> 69 intermediate-synchrotron peaked <b>blazars</b> and 134 high-synchrotron peaked <b>blazars)</b> {{from the}} second Fermi-LAT catalog (2 FGL) of γ-ray sources, which have X-ray observations. We calculated the lower limits for their Doppler factors, δγ, and compared the lower limits with the available Doppler factors and the apparent superluminal velocities in the literature...|$|R
40|$|In {{examining}} a select sample of over 200 <b>blazars</b> of known jet kinetic power (L_kin) and well-characterized SEDs, we found (Meyer et al., 2011) that Intermediate synchrotron-peaking (ISP) <b>blazars</b> may have lower gamma-ray output than high synchrotron-peaking (HSP) <b>blazars</b> of similar L_kin, {{consistent with our}} hypothesis that ISP <b>blazars</b> are less-beamed versions of HSP <b>blazars,</b> rather than a distinct population. Further, by using the radio core dominance {{as a measure of}} relative beaming, we find that gamma-ray luminosity depends on beaming in a consistent way for <b>blazars</b> ranging over all jet kinetic powers (10 ^ 42 - 10 ^ 46 ergs/s). We re-examine the gamma-ray properties of this core sample of <b>blazars</b> using the 1 -year LAT catalog (Abdo et al., 2010). We find that for weak jets, the ratio of inverse Compton to synchrotron emission remains constant with increased beaming, consistent with an SSC model for the jet emission, while the most powerful jets show a strong increase in Compton dominance with orientation, consistent with an external Compton (EC) emission model.

25|$|Gamma {{radiation}} in the TeV range {{emanating from}} the Crab Nebula was first detected in 1989 by the Whipple Observatory at Mt. Hopkins, in Arizona in the USA. Modern Cherenkov telescope experiments like H.E.S.S., VERITAS, MAGIC, and CANGAROO III can detect the Crab Nebula in a few minutes. The most energetic photons (up to 16 TeV) observed from an extragalactic object originate from the <b>blazar,</b> Markarian 501 (Mrk 501). These measurements were done by the High-Energy-Gamma-Ray Astronomy (HEGRA) air Cherenkov telescopes.|$|E
25|$|Historically, work on radio-loud {{unification}} has {{concentrated on}} high-luminosity radio-loud quasars. These can be unified with narrow-line radio galaxies {{in a manner}} directly analogous to the Seyfert 1/2 unification (but without the complication of {{much in the way}} of a reflection component: narrow-line radio galaxies show no nuclear optical continuum or reflected X-ray component, although they do occasionally show polarized broad-line emission). The large-scale radio structures of these objects provide compelling evidence that the orientation-based unified models really are true. X-ray evidence, where available, supports the unified picture: radio galaxies show evidence of obscuration from a torus, while quasars do not, although care must be taken since radio-loud objects also have a soft unabsorbed jet-related component, and high resolution is necessary to separate out thermal emission from the sources' large-scale hot-gas environment. At very small angles to the line of sight, relativistic beaming dominates, and we see a <b>blazar</b> of some variety.|$|E

However, some classes of <b>blazars</b> either do not show or show very little intra-day variability in a specific band of the electromagnetic spectrum. <b>Blazars</b> show rarely quasi-periodic oscillations in time series data in optical and X-ray bands.

We model the observed spectra of <b>blazars</b> from radio to optical frequencies using a synchrotron model that entails a log-parabolic distribution of electron energies. A significant correlation among the two fitted spectral parameters ($a$, $b$) of log-parabolic curves and a negative trend among the peak frequency and spectral curvature parameter, $b$, emphasize that the SEDs of <b>blazars</b> are fitted well by log-parabolic curves. On considering each model parameter that could be responsible for changes in the observed SEDs of these <b>blazars,</b> we find that changes in the jet Doppler factors are most important.

40|$|Almost {{the totality}} of the bright {{foreground}} sources in the WMAP CMB maps are <b>blazars,</b> a class of sources that show usually also X-ray emission. However, 23 objects in a flux-limited sample of 140 <b>blazars</b> of the WMAP catalog (first year) were never reported before as X-ray sources. We present here the results of 41 Swift observations which led to the detection of all these 23 <b>blazars</b> in the 0. 3 - 10 keV band. We conclude that all micro-wave selected <b>blazars</b> are X-ray emitters and that the distribution of the micro-wave to X-ray spectral slope α_mu x of LBL <b>blazars</b> is very narrow, confirming that the X-ray flux of most <b>blazars</b> is a very good estimator of their micro-wave emission. The X-ray spectral shape of all the objects that were observed long enough to allow spectral analysis is flat and consistent with inverse Compton emission within the commonly accepted view where the radiation from <b>blazars</b> is emitted in a Sychrotron-Inverse-Compton scenario. We predict that all <b>blazars</b> and most radio galaxies above the sensitivity limit of the WMAP and of the Planck CMB missions are X-ray sources detectable by the present generation of X-ray satellites. An hypothetical all-sky soft X-ray survey with sensitivity of approximately 10 ^- 15 erg/s would be crucial to locate and remove over 100, 000 <b>blazars</b> from CMB temperature and polarization maps and therefore accurately clean the primordial CMB signal from the largest population of extragalactic foreground contaminants.

40|$|<b>Blazars</b> are classically {{divided into}} the BL Lac (BLL) and Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) subclasses, {{corresponding}} to radiatively inefficient and efficient accretion regimes, respectively, {{largely based on}} the equivalent width (EW) of their optical broad emission lines (BEL). However, EW-based classification criteria are not physically motivated, and a few <b>blazars</b> have previously ‘transitioned’ from one subclass to the other. We present the first systematic search for these transition <b>blazars</b> {{in a sample of}} 602 unique pairs of repeat spectra of 354 <b>blazars</b> in SDSS, finding six clear cases. These transition <b>blazars</b> have bolometric Eddington ratios of ∼ 0. 3 and low-frequency synchrotron peaks, and are thus FSRQ-like. We show that the strong EW variability (up to an unprecedented factor of> 60) is due to swamping of the BELs from variability in jet continuum emission, which is stronger in amplitude and shorter in timescale than typical <b>blazars.</b> Although these transition <b>blazars</b> appear to switch between FSRQ and BLL according to the phenomenologically-based EW scheme, we show that they are most likely rare cases of FSRQs with radiatively efficient accretion flows and especially strongly-beamed jets. These results have implications for the decrease of the apparent BLL population at high-redshifts, and may add credence to claims of a negative BLL redshift evolution.

The GLAST can detect the correlation signal, if the <b>blazars</b> detected by GLAST trace the distribution of low-z quasars observed by optical galaxy surveys, which have the bias of unity. If the bias of <b>blazars</b> is greater than 1. 5, GLAST will detect the correlation signal unambiguously. We also find that GLAST may detect spatial clustering of clusters of galaxies in gamma-rays. The shape of the angular power spectrum is different for <b>blazars</b> and clusters of galaxies; thus, we can separate these two contributions {{on the basis of the}} shape of the power spectrum.

40|$|In paper 1 (Cheng et al. 2001) we {{have shown}} that the soft X-ray spectra of two types of Seyfert 1 galaxies {{statistically}} vary differently with increasing intensity. In order to understand how the spectrum of <b>blazars</b> changes, the spectral shape variability of 18 <b>blazars</b> observed by ROSAT/PSPC mode are studied by presenting the correlation of Hardness Ratio 1 versus Count Rates (HR 1 -CTs). According to our criteria, 10 <b>blazars</b> show a positive HR 1 -CTs relation, and only 2 <b>blazars</b> display an anti-correlation of HR 1 versus CTs. The rest 6 <b>blazars</b> do not indicate any clear correlation. From these we can see that most <b>blazars</b> of our sample statistically show a hardening spectrum during overall flux increase, though some vary randomly. By investigating the photon index of these objects and different radiation theories, we argue that the dominance of the synchrotron or inverse Compton emission in the soft X-ray band may interpret the dichotomy of spectral variability well, and that different spectral variations might represent a sequence of synchrotron peaked frequency.
