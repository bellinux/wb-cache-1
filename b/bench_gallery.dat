60|$|In shape, {{the chapel}} is an octagon, with {{galleries}} all round. It will seat, perhaps, four hundred people. Everything within is stained a tawny red; and there being but few windows, or rather embrasures, the dusky <b>benches</b> and <b>galleries,</b> and the tall spectre of a pulpit look anything but cheerful.|$|R
40|$|Today {{video art}} is inescapable and as {{ubiquitous}} as the LCD screen. Galleries {{have gone into}} a video frenzy. Suddenly projectors are cheap, freight and shipping of artworks non-existent and you can fill an entire gallery with one piece and a <b>bench.</b> <b>Galleries</b> have it made. Overheads have been reduced; artist fees turned to smoke and a bottomless pit of eager artists have backed up the s-bend ready to put out at all costs. Welcome to the video age. Just as painting had its day and assemblage saw more than it deserved, it 2 ̆ 7 s now time for video to take centre stage. But be warned. Just because it 2 ̆ 7 s video and {{happens to be in}} a gallery doesn 2 ̆ 7 t mean it 2 ̆ 7 s art [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Though it {{completely}} changed {{the appearance of}} the church, the rebuilding in 1865 seems in fact to have only marginally affected the structural parts of the 1788 church. The church has on the whole preserved its structure from 1865.In 1935, however, the choir was extended by four metres and a new sacristy was built. The choir was also extended with an office and other secondary rooms in 1968. The nave itself contains 44 <b>benches,</b> the <b>gallery</b> 14.|$|R
5000|$|Free public {{parking is}} {{extremely}} limited and is all on-street; {{there are also}} paid parking garages in the area. From the park {{at the top of}} the Cove, there are a few steps down on each side to a [...] "gallery" [...] area with a lot of <b>benches.</b> This <b>gallery</b> includes the entrance to the lifeguard station, where the lifeguard's chalkboard shows useful information updated throughout the day. From the gallery level there are two steep sets of concrete steps that lead down to the beach itself, although visitors often have to step on rocks to get all the way down to the sand.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{works by}} Gallaccio include Stroke (1993) in which <b>benches</b> in the <b>gallery</b> and {{cardboard}} panels {{attached to the}} walls were covered in chocolate, [...] "Two Hundred Kilos of Apples Tied to a Barren Apple Tree", Atelier Amden, Amden, Switzerland (1999) and Because Nothing has Changed (2000), a bronze sculpture of a tree adorned with porcelain apples. Because I Could Not Stop (2002) is a similar bronze tree but with real apples which are left to rot.|$|R
50|$|The building’s {{dominant}} {{feature is the}} fourth floor gallery which makes a bold and dramatic statement as it flies out from {{the core of the}} building, cantilevered and yet unsupported by an ornamental swelling column rising from the plaza below. Inside, Botta maintained a rigorous but elegant simplicity in the palette of materials which include steel, glass, terra cotta, black granite, polished concrete and wood. Botta also designed select pieces of furniture for the museum including the reception desk, café bar, <b>gallery</b> <b>benches</b> and hanging globe lights.|$|R
40|$|Old Jackson Theatre, Woodbine GA Tom Bruce {{set up his}} grocery/residence on {{this site}} in 1927; {{it is unclear whether}} he built it or if it was already there. Clarence Jackson bought the {{property}} and built the theater there. Early shows in the theatre were black and white silent movies. The seats were backless <b>benches</b> built up <b>gallery</b> style. There was no public restroom. In the 1950 ’s regular fold-up seats were installed and modern films were shown on the weekend. Cokes, candy and popcorn could be purchased in Mr. Jackson’s store next door. [URL]...|$|R
2500|$|In January 2014, the {{corporation}} announced a makeover of the 2.8-km stretch {{on the southern}} part of the beach from Lighthouse to Foreshore Estate, including development of walkways, <b>benches,</b> a <b>gallery,</b> bicycle tracks, concrete roads, service trenches, rainwater trenches and streetlight fittings at an estimated cost of [...] 400 million. The development would provide alternative accommodation to vendors of the existing market on the Marina Loop Road by commissioning of a modern fish market on the stretch. The loop road connecting the Lighthouse and Foreshore Estate, which is currently a 20-metre-wide road, will be converted to a four-lane concrete road barricaded on both sides with stainless steel pillared railings and will pass all along the Santhome coast of the Marina Beach. A 2.4-metre-wide bicycle track, a 3.3-metre-wide walkway and a 2.5-metre-wide gallery will be developed on the eastern side of the road. The western side of the road will have a fish market with cold storage facilities as well as a walkway.|$|R
2500|$|In 1851 Warfield parish {{changed for}} the first time on record to create a Parish of Bracknell with its own church, Holy Trinity. In 1860 William Cocks wrote an account of Warfield church. [...] He {{describes}} box pews, whitewashed ceiling, and a gallery across the back with a barrel organ given by Lady Jane Walsh. There was a two-deck pulpit, and the farm workers sat at the back on <b>benches.</b> The west <b>gallery</b> later to be known as the [...] "Ormathwaite gallery" [...] was entered by a stairway from inside the church, where his Lordship sat with his servant.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Portico, as we know, {{was always}} talking about going to Europe; but she had not yet--I mean {{a year after the}} {{incident}} I have just related--put her hand upon a youthful cicerone. Petticoats, of course, were required; it was necessary that her companion should be of the sex which sinks most naturally upon <b>benches,</b> in <b>galleries</b> and cathredrals, and pauses most frequently upon staircases that ascend to celebrated views. She was a widow, with a good fortune and several sons, all of whom were in Wall Street, and none of them capable of the relaxed pace at which she expected to take her foreign tour. They were all in a state of tension. They went through life standing. She was a short, broad, high-colored woman, with a loud voice, and superabundant black hair, arranged in a way peculiar to herself,--with so many combs and bands that it had the appearance of a national coiffure. There was an impression in New York, about 1845, that the style was Danish; some one had said something about having seen it in Schleswig-Holstein.|$|R
6000|$|As he rode {{into the}} {{courtyard}} he observed that it was also approached by another road, evidently nearer Los Gatos, and probably the older and shorter communication between the two ranchos. The fact was significantly demonstrated a moment later. He had given his horse to a servant, sent in his card to Clementina, and had dropped listlessly {{on one of the}} <b>benches</b> of the <b>gallery</b> surrounding the patio, when a horseman rode briskly into the opposite gateway, and dismounted with a familiar air. A waiting peon who recognized him informed him that the Dona was engaged with a visitor, but that they were both returning to the gallery for chocolate in a moment. The stranger was the man he had left only an hour before--Don Diego Fletcher! ...|$|R
5000|$|The chapel is {{constructed}} in colourwashed stone, {{and it has}} a tiled roof. At the rear is a brick chimney. On the front of the chapel facing the road is a central porch with a sash window on each side. At the rear there are two similar windows, and two more similar windows on both end walls at a higher level. The extension has a door and two casement windows. Inside the chapel are a <b>gallery,</b> <b>benches</b> and a pulpit, all of which are original, although the pulpit has been moved from its original position. [...] In front of the pulpit is a baptismal pool for full immersion. Also in the chapel is a fireplace, and simple memorials, most of which are painted.|$|R
50|$|The {{design was}} {{carefully}} evolved {{in response to}} a public competition for museum seating announced by the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology in 2009. Burt has now made over 20 benches utilising a subtly slender aerofoil cross-section matched to end grain blocked ends It is his most extensive museum project to date. The <b>benches</b> suit the <b>galleries</b> of the original building with as much grace and purpose as the modernist extension by Rick Mather, and the ability to tie together the public spaces was {{an important part of the}} commission. There is a new element to three benches commissioned in September 2011 for the Egyptian Galleries (and installed in November) with a subtle change of configuration of the seat to the leg, with its 'flare' as Burt says 'more referentially apposite' to the tenor and the subject of the spaces. These benches are made from Herefordshire oak.|$|R
6000|$|... "Our {{ambassador}} titles," [...] {{said the}} fervid Clootz, [...] "are not written on parchment, {{but on the}} living hearts of all men." [...] These whiskered Polacks, long-flowing turbaned Ishmaelites, astrological Chaldeans, who stand so mute here, let them plead with you, august Senators, more eloquently than eloquence could. They are the mute representatives of their tongue-tied, befettered, heavy-laden Nations; who from out of that dark bewilderment gaze wistful, amazed, with half-incredulous hope, towards you, and this your bright light of a French Federation: bright particular day-star, the herald of universal day. We claim to stand there, as mute monuments, pathetically adumbrative of much.--From <b>bench</b> and <b>gallery</b> comes 'repeated applause;' for what august Senator but is flattered even by the very shadow of Human Species depending on him? From President Sieyes, who presides this remarkable fortnight, {{in spite of his}} small voice, there comes eloquent though shrill reply. Anacharsis and the 'Foreigners Committee' shall have place at the Federation; on condition of telling their respective Peoples what they see there. In the mean time, we invite them to the 'honours of the sitting, honneur de la seance.' A long-flowing Turk, for rejoinder, bows with Eastern solemnity, and utters articulate sounds: but owing to his imperfect knowledge of the French dialect, (Moniteur, &c. (in Hist. Parl. xii. 283).) his words are like spilt water; the thought he had in him remains conjectural to this day.|$|R
60|$|But this functionary {{of the law}} {{reserved}} {{one important}} piece of intelligence, and kept it snugly to himself. When he had issued his instructions relative to every {{other part of the}} building, and the mob were dispersed from end to end, and busy at their work, he took a bundle of keys from a kind of cupboard in the wall, and going by a kind of passage near the chapel (it joined the governors house, and was then on fire), betook himself to the condemned cells, which were a series of small, strong, dismal rooms, opening on a low gallery, guarded, at the end at which he entered, by a strong iron wicket, and at its opposite extremity by two doors and a thick grate. Having double locked the wicket, and assured himself that the other entrances were well secured, he sat down on a <b>bench</b> in the <b>gallery,</b> and sucked the head of his stick with the utmost complacency, tranquillity, and contentment.|$|R
40|$|As {{the most}} {{extensive}} display of Audio Arts to date covering the period from 1973 to 2006, the exhibition explores the relationships between an artist’s practice, the changing concept of an archive, and includes the documents, tapes, images equipment and other related material of this ongoing research project. The underlying intention of the project is to foreground the artist’s account {{of his or her}} thinking, ideas and intentions in relation to practice. Furlong has always considered Audio Arts to be an integral and symbiotic part of his practice which he describes as ‘a recorded space for contemporary art’. The long term aim of the project is to explore if an archive of sound can act as a primary form of contemporary art history delivered directly from the artist without the ‘distancing filters’ of a ‘third hand’ printed version of events. Held in Room 38 as part of the Tate’s ‘re-hang’ in March 2007, 5 flat top vitrines containing elements of the archive along with 3 plinths and wall displays were included, as well as 4 x 80 minute CD’s containing up to 320 minutes of Audio Arts recordings drawn from 4 decades of activity. Visitors were able to make selections for listening on headphones positioned on 4 <b>benches</b> in the <b>Gallery.</b> The complete collection of Audio Arts cassettes and CD boxes were displayed. This process of foregrounding the artist's account of their thinking via an interview process is used by Furlong in the publication ‘Making Art Work’ by Patsy Craig, ISBN 1904563066 (Trolley Ltd, 2003) focusing on artists from the Mike Smith Studio, London...|$|R
50|$|The first festival, {{sponsored}} by Manchester School of Art {{and supported by}} G. F Smith and Design Week, took Longevity as its theme: “celebrating the importance of creativity in society in what can be challenging economic times… (discussing) sustainable design and its importance to our economic and environmental future; how to keep design fresh, new and creative in an ever-evolving world; and why print will never die.” Manchester creatives collaborated to create an exhibition, “10 x 10”, curated by John Owens and shown at <b>Bench</b> Self Made <b>Gallery</b> and Kosmonaut in the Northern Quarter. The contributing artists and designers were: Mark Kennedy and David Arnott (Pub of the week. Forever.), Dr John Cooper Clarke and John Owens (Things are gonna get worse), Dave Sedgwick aka Designbydave and Tim Denton (Don't sit still. Keep going.), Helen Musselwhite and Loz Ives aka Fieldwork (Save Yourself), Jon Bland and Mike Ash of Music (howfatisjonbland.com), Owt Creative (Diamonds aren’t forever), Matt Booth and Zelig Sound (VISUALISER), Percy Dean and Alan & Brenda (Alan and Brenda: Diptych: Percy Dean 2013), Katherine Beefheart and Buddha (Karma's a bitch), Liam Hopkins aka Lazerian and Daren Newman (Unknown Time). The first Design Manchester Conference took place at Manchester Town Hall on 31 October and was opened by the Deputy Leader of Manchester City Council, Councillor Sue Murphy. Hosted by Professor David Crow, the Conference heard from Mark Farrow RDI in conversation with Design Week editor Angus Montgomery; Kate Moross; Colophon Foundry; Nat Hunter and Mark Shayler of the RSA; Andrew Shoben and Peter Saville RDI. Other events included a D&AD Creative Brief-in, talks, workshops and a party at Kosmonaut. DM13 was attended by 1,000 visitors.|$|R
60|$|He went in {{and took}} his seat, and the chamber seemed to him to be mysteriously large, as though benches were crowded over <b>benches,</b> and <b>galleries</b> over galleries. He had been long enough in the House to have lost the {{original}} awe inspired by the Speaker and the clerks of the House, by the row of Ministers, and by the unequalled importance of the place. On ordinary occasions he could saunter in and out, and whisper at his ease to a neighbour. But on this occasion he went direct to the bench on which he ordinarily sat, and began at once to rehearse to himself his speech. He had in truth been doing this all day, {{in spite of the}} effort that he had made to rid himself of all memory of the occasion. He had been collecting the heads of his speech while Mr. Low had been talking to him, and refreshing his quotations in the presence of Lord Chiltern and the dumb-bells. He had taxed his memory and his intellect with various tasks, which, as he feared, would not adjust themselves one with another. He had learned the headings of his speech,--so that one heading might follow the other, and nothing be forgotten. And he had learned verbatim the words which he intended to utter under each heading,--with a hope that if any one compact part should be destroyed or injured in its compactness by treachery of memory, or by the course of the debate, each other compact part might be there in its entirety, ready for use;--or at least so many of the compact parts as treachery of memory and the accidents of the debate might leave to him; so that his speech might be like a vessel, watertight in its various compartments, that would float by the buoyancy of its stern and bow, even though the hold should be waterlogged. But this use of his composed words, even though {{he should be able to}} carry it through, would not complete his work;--for it would be his duty to answer in some sort those who had gone before him, and in order to do this he must be able to insert, without any prearrangement of words or ideas, little intercalatory parts between those compact masses of argument with which he had been occupying himself for many laborious hours. As he looked round upon the House and perceived that everything was dim before him, that all his original awe of the House had returned, and with it a present quaking fear that made him feel the pulsations of his own heart, he became painfully aware that the task he had prepared for himself was too great. He should, on this the occasion of his rising to his maiden legs, have either prepared for himself a short general speech, which could indeed have done little for his credit in the House, but which might have served to carry off the novelty of the thing, and have introduced him to the sound of his own voice within those walls,--or he should have trusted to what his wit and spirit would produce for him on the spur of the moment, and not have burdened himself with a huge exercise of memory. During the presentation of a few petitions he tried to repeat to himself the first of his compact parts,--a compact part on which, as it might certainly be brought into use let the debate have gone as it might, he had expended great care. He had flattered himself that there was something of real strength in his words as he repeated them to himself in the comfortable seclusion of his own room, and he had made them so ready to his tongue that he thought it to be impossible that he should forget even an intonation. Now he found that he could not remember the first phrases without unloosing and looking at a small roll of paper which he held furtively in his hand. What was the good of looking at it? He would forget it again in the next moment. He had intended to satisfy the most eager of his friends, and to astound his opponents. As it was, no one would be satisfied,--and none astounded but they who had trusted in him.|$|R
