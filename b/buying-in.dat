50|$|Rearing larvae {{through the}} early life stages is {{conducted}} in nurseries which are generally closely associated with hatcheries for fish culture whilst {{it is common for}} shellfish nurseries to exist separately. Nursery culture of larvae to rear juveniles of a size suitable for transferral to on-growing facilities can be performed in a variety of different systems which may be entirely land-based, or larvae may be later transferred to sea-based rearing systems which reduce the need to supply feed. Juvenile survival is dependent on very high quality water conditions.Feeding is {{an important component of the}} rearing process. Although many species are able to grow on maternal reserves alone (lecithotrophy), most commercially produced species require feeding to optimise survival, growth, yield and juvenile quality. Nutritional requirements are species specific and also vary with larval stage. Carnivorous fish are commonly fed with live prey; rotifers are usually offered to early larvae due to their small size, progressing to larger Artemia nauplii or zooplankton. The production of live feed on-site or <b>buying-in</b> is one of the biggest costs for hatchery facilities as it is a labour-intensive process. The development of artificial feeds is targeted to reduce the costs involved in live feed production and increase the consistency of nutrition, however decreased growth and survival has been found with these alternatives.|$|E
40|$|Over {{a period}} of fifteen years {{executive}} coaching {{being used as a}} support to leaders in their role has grown from a relatively unknown approach to a mainstream activity in organisations and is likely the fastest growing developmental method in Sweden. Its definition and purpose covers a wide spectrum and the activity is poorly defined. There are a number of questions about the contribution of the service to individual and organisational success and to effectiveness on both an individual and an organisational level. The overarching aim of this research is to explore, describe and acquire a deeper understanding of how executive coaching supports leaders in their role. The point of departure has been to investigate the interaction going on between the stakeholders involved, namely the executive coach, the coachee and the sponsoring organisation. The aim is to provide a research-informed Executive Coaching <b>Buying-in</b> Model to facilitate the <b>buying-in</b> process for the Swedish market. A qualitative research method based on a hermeneutic perspective was designed. 73 semi- structured individual interviews and four group interviews involving 12 persons were conducted. In total 85 respondents participated in the study. The respondents came from various types of companies including Global companies, Government authorities, Small entrepreneurial companies, Municipalities, Management consulting companies and Swedish coach companies. The theoretical perspectives used included psychological theories, leadership theories as well as other influences and roots of Executive Coaching. Some interesting conclusions can be drawn from the study. For example a distinct differentiation between executive coaching and other types of coaching is preferable for the outcome-process and also from an organisational perspective. The borders between executive coaching, counselling and psychotherapy are indistinct and today virtually anyone could claim to be an executive coach. The market calls for more research and those involved in the executive coaching assignment need to be more aware of the various processes going on during the <b>buying-in</b> process. Based on the findings a seven-stage Executive coaching <b>Buying-in</b> Model was constructed. When it comes to the Swedish market certain areas are defined for future research. One central issue is to further work in distinguishing and defining the concept of Executive Coaching in relation to other coaching services and activities. Another matter is to ascertain qualifications for an executive coach with a focus on special competencies, professional training and curriculum. Furthermore it seems necessary to establish clear borders between executive coaching and other developmental tools. It also would be of value to evaluate and find new systems to measure the effect of executive coaching and its outcome. Another desirable task is to investigate and clarify the activities of the main coaching bodies in terms of their similarities and divergences {{and to be able to}} create an overall standard and certification system that is mutually agreed. Finally applying, testing and implementing the Executive Coaching <b>Buying-in</b> Model constructed as a result of this research are seen as a part of future research activities.

This bachelor thesis analyzes development {{of renewable energy}} sources in Slovakia with focus on the utilization of landfill gas. It generally explains what the renewables are, which types are nowadays being used for the electricity production. It closely specifies the landfill gas, its creation, physical and chemical properties, composition, production and utilization for energy purposes. Moreover it characterizes the legislation of The European Union as well as Slovak one. The next part defines the problems and barriers that accrue from the development of renewables in Slovakia. The last analytical part expresses the criticism of constant changes in legislation (mostly in regulation of <b>buying-in</b> prices and fees) before and especially after the year 2009 which results in significant decrease of the available renewable energy sources utilization and their farther development (predominantly {{from the viewpoint of}} economic profitability) ...|$|E
40|$|A concise {{account that}} {{supplements}} topics only briefly mentioned in other {{contributions to the}} anthology Other Cinemas, this piece provides a factual overview of the establishment and early context surrounding the fourth British terrestrial television channel, Channel 4 (C 4), which started broadcasting in 1982. With its dedicated ‘Independent Film and Video Department’, C 4 opened air-time to more diverse content through its alternative model, which, rather than making programmes in-house, operated as a ‘publisher-broadcaster’ by <b>buying-in</b> and commissioning work. Developed following a series of interviews/conversations between Holdsworth and former deputy Commissioning Editor at the Channel, Professor Rod Stoneman (National University of Ireland, Galway) this co-authored overview (1, 300 words) observes how the Channel’s initial founding remit stemmed from an ethos towards innovation that owed much to the experimental ‘independent’ and ‘workshop’ artistic film and video sectors that emerged in 1970 s Britain. This chapter is supplemented by two contributions to the book (a chapter on the IFA and another short section on the Workshop Declaration) {{as well as a}} chronology (all written by Holdsworth) ...|$|E
40|$|Logistic regression, {{supported}} by other statistical analyses {{was used to}} explore the possible association of risk factors with the fluoroquinolone (FQ) -resistance status of 108 pig finisher farms in Great Britain. The farms were classified as 'affected' or 'not affected' by FQ-resistant E. coli or Campylobacter spp. {{on the basis of}} isolation of organisms from faecal samples on media containing 1 mg/l FQ. The use of FQ was the most important factor associated with finding resistant E. coli and/or Campylobacter, which were found on 79 % (FQ-resistant E. coli) and 86 % (FQ-resistant Campylobacter) of farms with a history of FQ use. However, resistant bacteria were also found on 19 % (FQ-resistant E. coli) and 54 % (FQ-resistant Campylobacter) of farms with no history of FQ use. For FQ-resistant E. coli, biosecurity measures may be protective and there was strong seasonal variation, with more farms found affected when sampled in the summer. For FQ-resistant Campylobacter, the <b>buying-in</b> of grower stock may increase risk and good on-farm hygiene may be protective. The findings suggest that resistant organisms, particularly Campylobacter, may spread between pig farms...|$|E
40|$|Service-learning {{is a form}} of knowledge-transfer-based, credit-bearing {{community}} service. It affords {{an opportunity}} for knowledge transfer in a two-way process: not only the community can learn and benefit from university-level knowledge but also, university students and academics can gain insights into the rich community based indigenous knowledge and gain many life skills. Universities neither around the globe nor those within South Africa offer academic programmes for service-learning per-se, but only service-learning modules as components of academic programmes. Quality assurance of service-learning modules is essential to attract both academics and students to service-learning as an acceptable component of academic programmes, to ensure adequate relevance and resonance to those programmes, to achieve the whole-hearted <b>buying-in</b> of the service-learning by the community collaborators/external stakeholders and to attract continued funding for service-learning initiatives. Assessments (measurements) which lead to evaluations (judgments) are necessary in order not only to facilitate review and assure the quality of service-learning modules but also to catalyse their development and sustenance. The purpose of the present paper is to look at some factors regarding the quality assurance of service-learning modules (components) in university-affiliated academic programmes which could assure their sustainability. The focus is on the minimum imperatives that are to be assessed in order to assess and finally evaluate service-learning programmes in a quality assurance perspective...|$|E
40|$|Biosecurity, {{defined as}} a series of {{measures}} aiming to stop disease-causing agents entering or leaving an area where farm animals are present, is very important for the continuing economic viability of the United Kingdom dairy sector, and for animal welfare. This study gathered expert opinion from farmers, veterinarians, consultants, academics, and government and industry representatives on the practicality and effectiveness of different biosecurity measures on dairy farms. The study used best-worst scaling, a technique that allows for greater discrimination between choices and avoids the variability in interpretation associated with other methods, such as Likert scales and ranking methods. Keeping a closed herd was rated as the most effective measure overall, and maintaining regular contact with the veterinarian was the most practical measure. Measures relating to knowledge, planning, and veterinary involvement; <b>buying-in</b> practices; and quarantine and treatment scored highly for effectiveness overall. Measures relating to visitors, equipment, pest control, and hygiene scored much lower for effectiveness. Overall, measures relating to direct animal-to-animal contact scored much higher for effectiveness than measures relating to indirect disease transmission. Some of the most effective measures were also rated as the least practical, such as keeping a closed herd and avoiding nose-to-nose contact between contiguous animals, suggesting that real barriers exist for farmers when implementing biosecurity measures on dairy farms. We observed heterogeneity in expert opinion on biosecurity measures; for example, veterinarians rated the effectiveness of consulting the veterinarian on biosecurity significantly more highly than dairy farmers, suggesting a greater need for veterinarians to promote their services on-farm. Still, both groups rated it as a practical measure, suggesting that the farmer-veterinarian relationship holds some advantages for the promotion of biosecurity...|$|E
40|$|Women in {{conservative}} welfare states {{continue to do}} more unpaid domestic labour than their partners. Many European countries subsidize the outsourcing of routine housework and care labor to market services through tax credits and other measures, {{with the aim of}} reducing women's unpaid work. Most research on the determinants of outsourcing replicate gendered exchange-bargaining models, and neglect market factors relevant to explaining the substitution of unpaid labour. The neglect of market factors however, is mainly due to data limitations. Drawing on a new data set in the German Socio-Economic Panel Innovation Study (SOEP-IS) develop models, which include market as well as resource factors in examining the determinants of outsourcing domestic labour. The analyses confirm previous research findings, that households with more resources are more likely to outsource. Thus, the availability of tax credits for household purchases does not seem to encourage households with lower incomes to shift unpaid domestic labour to the market. In contrast to previous research findings based on exchange-bargaining theory, relative resources of women are neither predictors of more or of less outsourcing. Models explaining the gendered division of labour are not necessarily transferable to the study of outsourcing unpaid labour to the market. Previous research in Germany finds that partners revert to traditional gendered divisions of labour when they become parents. We find that the presence of young children increases the probability of outsourcing, suggesting that <b>buying-in</b> services may be a way in which re-traditionalization is averted. Overall, market factors have a strong impact on whether households outsource or not, especially demand for eldercare and the availability of services. Yet most labour available to German households is not supplied by the service sector, but from the black market. The article concludes that future research needs to address the interaction of demand and supply side factors, ideally in cross-national household-level analyses...|$|E
40|$|The {{big data}} {{framework}} applied to smart meters offers an exception platform for data-driven forecasting {{and decision making}} to achieve sustainable energy efficiency. <b>Buying-in</b> consumer confidence through respecting occupants' energy consumption behavior and preferences towards improved participation in various energy programs is imperative but difficult to obtain. The key elements for understanding and predicting household energy consumption are activities occupants perform, appliances and the times that appliances are used, and inter-appliance dependencies. This information can be extracted from the context rich big data from smart meters, although this is challenging because: (1) it is not trivial to mine complex interdependencies between appliances from multiple concurrent data streams; (2) {{it is difficult to}} derive accurate relationships between interval based events, where multiple appliance usage persist; (3) continuous generation of the energy consumption data can trigger changes in appliance associations with time and appliances. To overcome these challenges, we propose an unsupervised progressive incremental data mining technique using frequent pattern mining (appliance-appliance associations) and cluster analysis (appliance-time associations) coupled with a Bayesian network based prediction model. The proposed technique addresses the need to analyze temporal energy consumption patterns at the appliance level, which directly reflect consumers' behaviors and provide a basis for generalizing household energy models. Extensive experiments were performed on the model with real-world datasets and strong associations were discovered. The accuracy of the proposed model for predicting multiple appliances usage outperformed support vector machine during every stage while attaining accuracy of 81. 65 %, 85. 90 %, 89. 58 % for 25 %, 50 % and 75 % of the training dataset size respectively. Moreover, accuracy results of 81. 89 %, 75. 88 %, 79. 23 %, 74. 74 %, and 72. 81 % were obtained for short-term (hours), and long-term (day, week, month, and season) energy consumption forecasts, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{upstream}} {{oil and gas}} industry suffers from inefficient performances in projects. On one hand, motivated by the facts that construction projects have achieved positive results by carrying out ongoing research on relationship-based contracting (partnering and alliancing) and implementing its performance measurement, this thesis aims to investigate the key elements (KEs) and key performance indicators (KPIs) of partnering and alliancing (P&A) that can be applied from construction projects to upstream O&G construction projects for benchmarking in order to handle complex procurements and improve efficiency of performances. The analysis of empirical data identifies that the KEs of P&A are (1) trust (2) effective communication (3) clear role and responsibility (4) cooperation and collaboration (5) mutual objectives and goals (6) risk and reward sharing mechanism (7) conflict and problem resolution and (8) continuous evaluation and improvement, and the KPIs of P&A are (1) health and safety (2) quality (3) trust and respect (4) effective communication (5) client s satisfaction (6) cost (7) time (8) schedule and (9) harmonious and cooperative working relationships. The similarities between the literature review and the findings indicate trust, effective communication, risk and reward sharing mechanism, cooperation and collaboration and continuous evaluation and improvement as defining features of KEs of P&A projects irrespective of industries. The notable differences illustrate that although both projects share common characteristics, certain elements of P&A can be difference in practices. The similarities in relation with the KPIs of P&A are found as health and safety, quality and additionally effective communication. On one hand, it is an interesting fact that client s satisfaction is identified in upstream O&G construction projects from the findings. Another remarkable difference is that harmonious and cooperative working relationships is appeared as the KPI of P&A, and moreover, trust and respect is ranked higher in upstream O&G construction projects compared to construction projects. The interview emphasizes the importance of carrying out a feasibility study and increasing understanding of P&A prior to its application. In addition, due to excessive competitiveness in most consortium projects, the win-win philosophy becomes <b>buying-in.</b> Also the leadership skills of a project director and manager and an establishment of a cooperative and collaborative culture are mentioned. Moreover, the power trip, egoism and opportunism behaviors are pointed out as the chronical problems in projects...|$|E
40|$|According to the Financial Sector (FS) Charter, in August 2002, at the NEDLAC Financial Sector Summit, "the {{financial}} sector {{committed itself to}} the development of a Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) charter. It made this commitment, noting that: "Despite significant progress since the establishment of a democratic government in 1994, South African society remains characterised by racially based income and social services inequalities. This is not only unjust, but inhibits the country's ability to achieve its full economic potential. BEE is a mechanism aimed at addressing inequalities and mobilising the energies of all South Africans. It will contribute towards sustained economic growth, development and social transformation in South Africa. Inequalities also manifest themselves in the country's {{financial sector}}. A positive and proactive response from the sector through the implementation of BEE will further unlock the sector's potential, promote its global competitiveness, and enhance its world class status". Parties of the Financial Sector Charter agreed on the seven pillars below: 1) Human resource management - provide resources to develop skills of black people with the aim of increasing black participation in all levels of management in the sector. 2) Procurement policies - implement a targeted procurement strategy to enhance BEE. 3) Enterprise development - improve the level of support provided to BEE companies in all sectors of the economy. This would be achieved through skills transfer, administration and technical support. 4) Access to financial services - provide affordable financial services to the previously disadvantaged groups and making sure financial services are accessible to these groups. 5) Empowerment financing - work closely with government and government financial institutions to increase resources for empowerment financing. 6) Ownership in the financial sector - 25 % of shares in each party of the FS Charter should be owned by black people by 2010. 7) Corporate social investrnent (CSI) - Each financial institution will have to spend 0. 5 % of their after-tax profit on corporate social investment projects. The projects should be targeted at black groups with a strong focus on transformation. The research evaluates the applicability of Lewin's Force Field Analysis (a change management model) in the implementation of the Financial Sector Charter at Standard Bank of South Africa. It attempts to achieve this by looking at how the Financial Sector Charter is being implemented at Standard Bank. The research looks at three main areas: 1) The "context" of the research problem, by seeking to understand Standard Bank's understanding of the FS Charter, the importance of implementing the FS Charter by the bank, the progress made thus far in the FS Charter implementation and comparison to the BEE scorecards of the other three main bank. 2) The "process", i. e. how the FS Charter is implemented in the bank, the driving and restraining forces of successful implementation of the FS Charter and the lessons learnt. 3) The "outcome", i. e. benefits of implementing the FS Charter and what could be done to ensure that change management processes are successfully implemented. Personal interviews were used to discover other valuable information which was not available on the bank's published documents, and other related sources such as the Financial Sector Charter document. The sample size for the study was ten Standard Bank employees from different areas of the bank who are either senior managers or directors, in the bank. Internal publications available on the Standard Bank intranet such as the bank's employment equity plans, and the bank's sustainability reports from 2004 to 2011 (Standard Bank, 2004 - 2011) were analysed for the purpose of the study. The researcher also analysed public documents such as the bank's annual financial reports, bank's equity reports and internal publications on related topics of the research question. Lewin's Forces Field Analysis (FFA) points out that in any environment where change is required; there are both driving and restraining forces that influence the implementation of a change programme. The FFA is a valuable change management tool at trying to transform the behaviour of an individual, and this will lead to transformation of groups and, ultimately the organisation. It also helps to establish the balance between the driving and restraining forces of the change programme. Lewin's (1951) theory put forward the idea that change occurs in three stages: the first stage of change is unfreezing; the second stage is moving and lastly, the third stage is refreezing. In the unfreezing stage, the bank's change management initiatives would need to be directed at giving the individuals a desire and motivation to be ready and open about a planned change initiative. This could be achieved by clearly communicating why change is important, benefits of change and the compelling reasons for change. In moving, the bank would need to give support and confidence to the people affected by change in order to start accepting and <b>buying-in</b> to new perspectives, which enable them to realise that change will improve the current situation. In the refreezing stage, the bank would need to ensure that new patterns of behaviour are reinforced. This will ensure that the changes are applied in everyday business, and this helps create a sense of stability, where those affected by change feel comfortable and confident with the new approach of doing things. The research concludes that managers should recognise the sensitivity around transformation, and should always try to ensure that change management initiatives directed at transformation are unifying, fair and transparent. This should be done to avoid a situation where an employee (or prospective employees) and other stakeholders feel under-appreciated or overlooked because of their gender or race. This demands a carefully crafted and implemented change management programme, whose results will not only unify the bank's employees, but also create a competitive edge for the bank. Lewin's Force Field Analysis (FFA) model is a change management tool that could be used to produce such results...|$|E
