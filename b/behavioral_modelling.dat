40|$|Objectives: Test {{the effect}} of deviant peer {{modeling}} on theft as conditioned by verbal support for theft and number of deviant models. Methods: Two related randomized experiments in which participants were {{given a chance to}} steal a gift card (ostensibly worth $ 15) from {{the table in front of}} them. Each experiment had a control group, a verbal prompting group in which confederate(s) endorsed stealing, a <b>behavioral</b> <b>modeling</b> group in which confederate(s) committed theft, and a verbal prompting plus <b>behavioral</b> <b>modeling</b> group in which confederate(s) did both. The first experiment used one confederate; the second experiment used two. The pooled sample consisted of 335 undergraduate students. Results: Participants in the verbal prompting plus <b>behavioral</b> <b>modeling</b> group were most likely to steal followed by the <b>behavioral</b> <b>modeling</b> group. Interestingly, <b>behavioral</b> <b>modeling</b> was only influential when two confederates were present. There were no thefts in either the control or verbal prompting groups regardless of the number of confederates. Conclusions: <b>Behavioral</b> <b>modeling</b> appears to be the key mechanism, though verbal support can strengthen {{the effect of}} <b>behavioral</b> <b>modeling.</b> UW/SSHRC Seed Gran...|$|R

A pure one-time-pad based protocol for securely computing the Hamming distance between binary sequences is developed and is shown, using the informationtheoretic security conditions, to be secure under both the active and passive <b>behavioral</b> <b>models.</b> In contrast, the general techniques of [1] and [2] require at least four parties when dealing with the active <b>behavioral</b> <b>model.</b> In particular, for the three-party problem considered herein, the BGW protocol that securely computes the squared l 2 distance between sequences under the passive <b>behavioral</b> <b>model</b> is demonstrated to be insecure under the active <b>behavioral</b> <b>model,</b> even for binary sequences when the squared l 2 distance coincides with the Hamming distance...|$|R

40|$|This work {{documents}} the important design considerations and high [...] level {{development of an}} efficient Continuous-Time DS A/D converter for given system requirements. Projecting characteristics is especially essential {{in the design of}} the option-versatile DS converter and involves both advanced control and signaling theory, in addition to circuit and system design. Thus, extensive simulations were carried out through synthesis and <b>behavioral</b> <b>modelling.</b> Synthesis was performed using R. Schreiers DS toolbox while modelling was done using the framework of Cadence with Virtuoso and Spectre. <b>Behavioral</b> <b>modelling</b> was based on the mixed-signaling language VerilogA. A list of candidates, meeting the performance requirements set, were formed from synthesis and two modulator architectures stood out; a multi-bit third order and a single-bit fifth order, both with an oversampling ratio of 32. Both feedback and feedforward loop filter structures were analyzed. A useful and powerful analysis was carried out to characterize and quantify the impact of location on nonidealities in DS modulators. The model was prepared for verification, helping to analyze, characterize and specify crucial parts of each structure. Decisive nonidealities, such as excess loop delay, finite DC gain, limited GBW, circuit noise and their influence on the overall modulator were included and examined. From this, a specification for the integrators as well as a preliminary noise and power budget was established. The final result ends in a realistic environment capable of analyzing different types of CTDS structures and making an informed decision on the most optimal and suitable configuration. Results from synthesis and <b>behavioral</b> <b>modelling</b> showed a great correspondance between the results obtained in each part. After an iterative process of evaluating performance among other metrics with nonideal effects, the best architecture was found to be the third order multi-bit feedback modulator, which achieved all of the requirements while consuming 3724 u...|$|E

40|$|Computer {{simulations}} and <b>behavioral</b> <b>modeling</b> {{are becoming}} increasingly important in product development processes.
