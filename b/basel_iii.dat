5|$|Countries {{sought to}} improve the {{sustainability}} and transparency of the global financial system in response to crises in the 1980s and 1990s. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was formed in 1974 by the G-10 members' central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation of banking practices. It is headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the Basel Accords. The first of these accords, known as Basel I, took place in 1988 and emphasized credit risk and the assessment of different asset classes. Basel I was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated, stemming from observations during the 1980s Latin American debt crisis. Following Basel I, the committee published recommendations on new capital requirements for banks, which the G-10 nations implemented four years later. In 1999, the G-10 established the Financial Stability Forum (reconstituted by the G-20 in 2009 as the Financial Stability Board) to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global financial system. The Forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof. The Basel II accord was set in 2004 and again emphasized capital requirements as a safeguard against systemic risk {{as well as the}} need for global consistency in banking regulations so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally. It was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks' risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies. Members were slow to implement it, with major efforts by the European Union and United States taking place as late as 2007 and 2008. In 2010, the Basel Committee revised the capital requirements in a set of enhancements to Basel II known as <b>Basel</b> <b>III,</b> which centered on a leverage ratio requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks. In addition to strengthening the ratio, <b>Basel</b> <b>III</b> modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings, concluding the capital threshold should be set at 7% of the value of a bank's risk-weighted assets.|$|E

40|$|Background and Problem: The {{occurrence}} of the latest financial crisis has revealed deficiencies within risk management in banks. There {{is a need for}} improvements in external as well as internal control in order to reinforce risk management in banking and thus prevent the emergence of another financial crisis. The Basel Accord represents the external control, which has great impact on banks’ risk management worldwide. A major lesson learned from the financial crisis is the importance of integrating risk management into top-level management decisions, however, problems may arise due to risk managers and decision makers having different point of reference. Aim of Study: The aim of this thesis is mainly to investigate how risk awareness manifests itself in top-level management in the Swedish universal banks and if the risk awareness has increased in Swedish universal banks in recent years. A further aim is to investigate how integrated risk management and top-level management is in Swedish universal banks and if they perceive this integration to be sufficient. Furthermore, the aim is to investigate what opinion Swedish universal banks have regarding Basel II’s current impact and <b>Basel</b> <b>III’s</b> future impact on risk management. We intend to further present a discussion in which we express our reflections and assessments regarding the subject of the thesis. Method: To answer the research question we have performed a qualitative interview study, hence conducted interviews in four Swedish universal banks. In order to gain a deeper understanding regarding the Basel Accord a major review of prior research and publications in the area of Basel has been carried out. In addition a thorough {{research in the area of}} risk management has been conducted. The empirical evidence is analyzed by means of the presented Frame of Reference. Analysis and Conclusion: The empirical findings indicate a rather highly developed risk management in the Swedish universal banks. The main perception among the banks is that there is no need to increase the level of risk awareness and the degree of consideration of risks in the Swedish universal banks. However, there is evidence showing increasing risk awareness during the past years, which is mainly a consequence of the financial crisis. There seems to be a consistent shortsightedness among the banks regarding risk assessment. Quantification of risks seems to facilitate a greater consideration of risk in top-level management, however problems arise due to an extensive trust in absolute risk figures. There seems to be a generally positive expressed opinion regarding the Basel Accord, where the framework of Basel II appears to have affected the banks’ risk management, whilst the perception is that the <b>Basel</b> <b>III’s</b> impact on risk management will be less comprehensive...|$|R

40|$|What {{factors and}} {{developments}} have fuelled the „cartelisation“ of capital markets? - {{to the extent}} of the rigging of EURIBOR and LIBOR rates? In what ways can EURIBOR and LIBOR rate rigging practices be addressed? How and why have offshore markets expanded to the degree and extent to which they exist today – this partly being explained through the multiplier effect, as well as the fact that onshore (national) regulations have boosted and facilitated the growth of offshore financial centers? This paper is not only aimed at addressing these issues and developments, but also highlights why (even though) the need for de regulation of national capital markets is justified, the converse appears to apply to the liberalisation of external capital markets. Furthermore, the liberalisation of global and external capital markets has provided the impetus and justification for the need to de regulate national capital markets. The need and concern for increased regulation of bond, equity markets, as well as other complex financial instruments which can be traded in OTC (Over- the-Counter) derivatives markets is evidenced by <b>Basel</b> <b>III's</b> focus. „Cartelisation“ and organised activities relating to rate rigging in global capital markets have been evidenced recently by sophisticated EURIBOR and LIBOR rate rigging practices and occurences. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 The 2008 global {{financial}} crisis revealed serious {{weaknesses in the}} worldwide banking system and financial regulatory regime. Concerns arose about the possible procyclical effects of risk-sensitive capital requirements that rely on Value-at-Risk (VaR) for managing market risks. The first chapter of this dissertation begins with {{a brief history of}} the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, its contribution in designing capital requirements, and some basic examples to illustrate how VaR contributes to the procyclicality of bank leverage and its amplification effects on financial markets. It then reviews the importance of financial factors, such as leverage and risk, on the business cycle and how the macroeconomic literature has attempted to account for these factors. The second and third chapters analyze how market risk-sensitive capital requirements can affect credit supply and amplify business cycles. These requirements effectively risk-constrain leveraged financial institutions and induce feedback effects on the macroeconomy when banks adjust their balance sheets to comply with these capital requirements. The second chapter analyzes the procyclical effects of Basel II's VaR-based capital requirements within a fully dynamic general equilibrium macroeconomic model with a financial sector. The model is calibrated to U. S. data and estimated with Bayesian techniques to pin down the dynamics and is able to capture four important business cycle correlations between financial factors and macroeconomic activity. The results suggest that when leveraged financial institutions are constrained by VaR-based capital requirements, increased financial market volatility forces banks to adjust their balance sheets to comply with higher capital charges by selling assets at reduced prices. This action depletes bank capital and deteriorates risk-weighted balance sheet positions, raising their perceived probability of default and interbank borrowing costs. Ultimately, these effects restrict the financial sector's ability to supply credit to the productive sectors to finance investment. Additionally, if financial markets become illiquid and banks are unable to sell assets and violate their risk constraints, the effects become amplified. These results provide some rationale for the Federal Reserve taking on the buyer of last resort role in the asset-backed securities market during the 2008 financial crisis. Thus, credit supply and market risk capital requirements are shown to be interdependent through risk constraints. The third chapter analyzes how <b>Basel</b> <b>III's</b> proposed switch from Value-at-Risk to stressed Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to measure market risks might affect the procyclicality of bank risk constraints on the macroeconomy. CVaR may reduce the spillover effects of market risk-sensitive capital requirements on credit supply and aggregate investment compared to the current VaR regime if regulation abandons the efficient markets hypothesis in favor of the fractal markets hypothesis and calibrates risks to stressed market conditions. Stressed CVaR can reduce banks' balance sheet response to increases in perceived volatility, which should reduce the risk-constrained feedback effects as banks are forced to comply with increased capital charges. However, because asset returns are generally non-normally distributed, if CVaR is locally calibrated to current market conditions it may amplify these effects in response to changes in perceived tail risks. These results provide some supporting evidence for <b>Basel</b> <b>III's</b> proposed stressed CVaR market risk regime...|$|R

It also addresses the concerns arising from high-leverage shadow bank lending practice and cautions against shadow banks operating in a black hole area that enables them to escape from regulatory purview.

What steps are necessary in ensuring that financial stability and recovery is facilitated? What kind of environment has the previous financial environment evolved to {{and what kind of}} financial products have also contributed to greater vulnerability in the triggering of systemic risks?

In highlighting the role and importance of various actors in post crises reforms and the huge impacts certain factors and products have contributed in exacerbating the magnitude and speed of transmission of financial contagion, it also provides an insight into why global financial crises have become more complicated to address than was previously the case. As well as considering and highlighting why matters related to pro cyclicality and capital measures should not constitute the sole focus of attention of the G 20 's initiatives, the book is aimed at identifying other important issues such as liquidity risks and requirements which have constituted, to a large extent, the focus of international standard setters and regulators. It also aims to direct regulators, central bank officials and supervisors, academics, business and legal professionals and other relevant interested parties in the field to current and previously ignored issues such as the "cartelisation" of capital markets.
