A parameter Sp {{was introduced to}} describe the intensity of a riverbed structure.

Field measurements on the bed load transportation, riverbed structure and hydraulic features were conducted in 15 tributaries of Xiaojiang River in the upper Yangtze River Basin in China. It has been found that the transport rate of bed load is affected by both the unit stream power and riverbed structure. In rivers or reaches with a similar unit stream power, the higher the riverbed structure intensity (the bigger the Sp), the lower the transport intensity of bed load, while the smaller the Sp, the higher the transport intensity of bed load. When the unit stream power is less than 50 kg/(m·s) and Sp larger than 0. 35, the transport rate of bed load would be 0...|$|E

Water Resources Research, 42 We assess how {{the size of}} the Helley-Smith (HS) <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>sampler</b> nozzle affects the accuracy of bed load sampling. Semitheoretical considerations show that the larger grains resident on the streambed can influence the sample either by blocking the sampler entrance or by causing the sampler to rest in a ??perched?? position. Probabilities for interference can be derived from the distribution of grain sizes but they do not capture the actual complexity of the influence of the bed on sampler performance. We therefore make an empirical comparison of sediment trapped by HS samplers with 76 - and 152 -mm intakes during floods in the gravel bed lower Ebro River. Most bed load rates appeared higher when sampled with the HS 152. The largest clasts collected by the HS 76 also tend to be smaller than those obtained with the HS 152 at the same flow. Analyzing paired bed load samples, we find the probability of a bed load sample collected with the HS 152 to be biased is around 43 % in the conditions of the present study, whereas 65 % of samples were biased when obtained with the HS 76. The analysis emphasizes the influence of bed material texture over sampler performance and demonstrates that the use of samplers with intake size much larger than bed grain size (i. e., 5 D) will increase the accuracy of bed load grain size distributions and the precision of annual load estimates in gravel bed rivers. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{estimates}} of a sediment {{budget for the}} regulated Snake River in Grand Teton National Park (GTNP) suggest that only in years with large dam releases are Snake River flows capable of remobilizing all the sediment delivered by tributaries. Our preliminary estimates were based on calibrated bed load transport relations developed for two major tributaries to the Snake River, Pacific Creek and Buffalo Fork, and an uncalibrated relation developed for the main-stem Snake River. Flows on the Snake River in GTNP have been regulated by operations of Jackson Lake Dam (JLD) since 1906, with a significant change to the flow regime occurring in 1958 that lowered peak flows and elevated late summer flows. The Snake River in GTNP is distinct from many other river systems impacted by dams in that JLD disrupts the flow of water, but not the flow of sediment to the Snake River. Alleged changes in the rate and frequency of channel avulsion and floodplain formation caused by operations of JLD are ultimately tied to the magnitude of bed material delivery from tributaries and transport by the main-stem Snake River. In an effort to better understand and assess changes in channel form and habitat impacts resulting from JLD operations, we are constructing a sediment budget for the Snake River in GTNP. This paper focuses on one component of this larger research effort: developing sediment transport relations for Pacific Creek and Buffalo Fork. We measured bed load transport rates on both tributaries over a range of discharges {{in the spring and}} summer, 2006, using a Toutle River <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>sampler.</b> We used these measurements to calibrate transport relations and estimated the flux of sediment entering the Snake River with these calibrated transport relations.

The protrusion of these grains {{is expected to have}} significant influence on the turbulent flow field and bed load transport. A field study was conducted to examine the turbulent properties of the flow around naturally formed protruding cobbles at mountain river reach namely Rasil River. The application of Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) was adopted in this study as to measure three-dimensional velocity components (stream-wise, vertical and span-wise) at high frequency measurement. Bed shear stress which is the fundamental variable to link flow conditions to bed load transport was used to characterize the turbulent flow field in this study. Overlay Analysis in GIS was used as a tool to graphically evaluate performance of bed shear stress in bed load transport study. The initial result from bed shear stress reveals that protruding cobble hadsignificantly modified the turbulent flow structure. High magnitude of bed shear stress that corresponds with the prevalent bed load transport activities was found to be concentrated on lower bed elevation zone. On the other hand, sheltering effect existed on the zone behind the protruding cobble thus result in weak or zero bed load transport actions. The derived critical bed load transport zones then were further confirmed by the zonation of sweeps and ejections event from turbulent bursting cycle. The most transported bed load was found to be coincided with high magnitude of sweeps and ejections events. It is evident that river hydraulic survey needs to be done first to identify the most transported bed load zones before deploying <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>sampler</b> to get an accurate measurement of bed load transport.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from July 12, 2016 - January 11, 2017 The spatial and temporal variability of sediment transport processes in Oak Creek, OR was investigated and used to explore two study questions: 1) How do sediment transport processes influence benthic algal communities?, and 2) Can fluvial-hydraulic models make accurate predictions of bed load transport rates? Our {{study was conducted in}} a 96 m reach of Oak Creek, OR – a small gravel bed stream in the Oregon Coast range. The study site is located in the same reach that was used to collect the historic Oak Creek bed load dataset of Milhous [1973]. To answer study question 1 we characterized the variability in sediment transport for a series of eight high flow events ranging from 0. 64 - 3. 4 m³/s using modeled shear stress (τ) from a field calibrated, high resolution (< 0. 1 m²) 2 - dimensional hydrodynamic model (FaSTMECH) coupled with detailed measurements of the channel substrate. The stream bed was then categorized into regions of high and low disturbance based on potential mobility of the median grain size using a Shield’s stress approach. High resolution (< 0. 25 m²), in-situ measurements benthic Chlorophyll-a (used as a metric of benthic algal production) were taken before and after high flow events in regions of contrasting disturbance to understand how benthic algal communities respond to sediment transport disturbance through both space and time. Growth factors including temperature, light, and nutrients were also measured. There was high spatial and temporal variability in both sediment transport and benthic Chl-a throughout the study period. We found significant differences (p< 0. 05) in benthic Chl-a concentrations between regions of high and low disturbance in half of the sampling events. The influence of sediment transport on benthic Chl-a was dependent on both the bed mobility and pre-disturbance Chl-a concentrations. There were also differences in benthic algal recovery rates in regions of contrasting disturbance following high flow events. The relationship between τ and Chl-a was highly variable, however the 95 th percentile quantile regression of Chl-a was consistent with the bell-curve shape of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis for 10 / 18 sampling events. This study shows that sediment transport processes do influence benthic algal growth dynamics however the magnitude of that influence is also dependent on pre-disturbance productivity. To answer study question 2 we made contemporary bed load measurements during 5 flow events ranging from 0. 24 bankfull (Q[subscript bf]) to 0. 52 Q[subscript bf] using a Helly-Smith <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>sampler</b> in order to confirm the stability of sediment transport dynamics in Oak Creek. The contemporary measurements were consistent with the historical dataset for total load however, they had a finer grain size distribution (GSD). A 2 - dimensional (2 -D) hydrodynamic model (FaSTMECH) was used to calculate spatial distributions of τ for 5 flow levels ranging from 0. 2 Qbf to Qbf (0. 64 - 3. 4 m³/s). Results indicate that τ is highly variable within the study reach and that mean normalized τ distributions are remarkably similar between flow levels. The τ distributions were then discretized and used to calculate bed load using surface and subsurface transport equations, and compared against the historical dataset for accuracy. Modeled bed load was consistently larger and coarser than the historical samples. Areas of τ greater than 2 times the mean comprised < 2. 5...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although {{previous}} studies have indicated the importance of flood events in the mobilization, transport and deposition of gold by streams, {{there have been no}} estimates of actual transport rates of sediment and gold as discharge varies both within and between years. Here, we use Helley–Smith <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>samples</b> from Harris Creek, a gold-rich gravel-cobble bed stream in British Columbia, to develop equations of the form Ri = aQ b that relate transport rates (Ri) of sediment, magnetite and gold to discharge (Q). These equations have then been used to estimate the amounts of sediment, magnetite and gold transported by Harris Creek in 1991, 1992 and 1993. Results show that the amount of material transported can vary by up to three orders of magnitude from year to year depending on the magnitude and duration of the snowmelt flood. Combined with the preferential deposition of Au at bar-head sites, it seems likely these large annual variations in the amount of Au transported result in similar year-to-year variations in the strength of stream sediment geochemical anomalies for Au...|$|R

The <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> data are related to a simultaneous record of average bed shear stress derived from the depth-slope product. The study reach is straight and includes a small, low-relief mid-channel bar which represents the divide between two zones of markedly different bed structure and stability. he bed of the left channel and bar tail is loose with an open framework, while that of the bar head and right channel is tightly interlocking and well imbricated. Bed surface grain size is similar throughout the reach. The two zones of contrasting bed structure have a strong influence {{on the threshold of}} sediment movement (τ c) and consequently the spatial pattern of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport. Entrainment thresholds for the tightly structured bed are up to seven times higher than those for the loosely structured bed. Sediment transport is therefore most frequent in the left channel and over the bar tail, where flows with excess shear stresses (τ > τc) peaking at 8 τc constitute 19 % of the flow record. This is in marked contrast to the right channel and bar head, where excess shear stresses of maximum 1. 4 τc total only 1. 3 % of the flow record. However, despite the marked difference in the magnitude and duration of competent flows between the two contrasting bed areas, little difference in <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> yield is observed between the nine traps when averaged over the 14 -month study period.

40|$|International audienceTo {{calculate}} <b>bed</b> <b>load,</b> engineers {{often use}} flow resistance equations that provide estimates of bed shear stress. In these equations, {{on the basis}} of the estimate of the appropriate hydraulic radius associated with the bed only, the bed roughness k s is commonly set as a constant, whatever the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> intensity. However, several studies have confirmed the existence of feedback mechanisms between flow resistance and <b>bed</b> <b>load,</b> suggesting that a flow-dependent bed roughness should be used. Therefore, using a data set composed of 2282 flume and field experimental values, this study investigated the importance of these feedback effects. New flow resistance equations were proposed for three flow domains: domain 1 corresponds to no <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> and a constant bed roughness k s = D (where D is a representative grain diameter), whereas domain 3 corresponds to a high <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate over a flat bed with a constant bed roughness k s = 2. 6 D. Between these two domains, a transitional domain 2 was identified, for which the bed roughness evolved from D to 2. 6 D with increasing flow conditions. In this domain, the Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficient f can be approximated using a constant for a given slope. The results using this new flow resistance equation proved to be more accurate than those using equations obtained from simple fittings of logarithmic laws to mean values. The data set indicates that distinguishing domains 2 and 3 is still relevant for <b>bed</b> <b>load.</b> In particular, the data indicate a slope dependence in domain 2 but not in domain 3. A <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> model, based on the tractive force concept, is proposed.

The data acquired were the distribution of flow speed {{and the spread of}} <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> along the estuary during dry season. Seventeen locations along the river estuary were selected started from about 1500 m upstream the coastline. The speed measurements were carried out in two points at each location, at 0. 6 of the river depth and on riverbed. The <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> measurements were done at points close to the riverbed (0. 4 to 0. 6 cm approaching the riverbed). The modeling of the river flow speed at the points near the riverbed {{as well as at the}} points 0. 6 of the depth during low tides showed a decrease in the speed distribution pattern with increasing distance up to the coastline. At the times of low tide, transports of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> takes place in the estuary region of Ranoyapo River. The increase of flow speed due to the increase of flow debit will result in the increase of flow velocity that may exceed the critical value. This allows the transportation of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> to increase. In the condition of high tide, the pattern of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> distribution showed <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport at locations one to eight. In the contrary, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> material at locations nine to seventeen were not transportable, meaning that the flow velocity at those locations was unable to transport <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> sediment towards the coast line.

And a climate change might lead to an increased frequency of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport and change in grain size trend in mountain river basins. The theme for this master thesis is of importance for the society, because possible effects of a climate change is more frequent flooding and landslide events that might cause the society unexpected stain. This master thesis {{is based on a}} comparison of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport and grain size trend between two locations situated upstream - and downstream for a dominating landslide in Vekveselva, Oppdal. The two locations and the dominating landslide are located in a 330 meter study rich which is dominated by a step – pool morphology.

In concrete terms, 68 measurements of stream discharge and <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate were carried out at a location, near the basin outlet.

The study conducted at 5 stations at Lebir River. The rainfall precipitation in December 2014 showed that the maximum rainfall event will cause the high amount of rainfall precipitation and will increase the production of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport. Therefore, the surface erosion also gives contribution to the increase of sediment transport and had become the one of main problem at Lebir River after flood in December 2014. The <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> pattern at each point were identified through the sedimentation process. The <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> pattern gave the variation of sediment transport modes at Lebir River. The <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> discharge were evaluated using three different formulas which were Meyer Peter and Muller, Schoklitsch and Duboys equation.

40|$|Bed load {{transport}} {{in mountain}} streams {{is very difficult}} to be determined since it strongly correlates to streambed structure (roughness structure). Based on a specially designed underwater observation and video-capturing system, experiments on <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> movement under three streambed structure development scenarios, i. e., well developed, partially developed, and no streambed structures (plane bed), was conducted in a mountain stream in southwest China. Dynamic features of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport (starting mode, trajectory, velocity, and acceleration velocity) under these three typical streambed conditions were observed and analyzed. The streambed structure development degree was measured by a specially manufactured instrument to analyze correlation between <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport and streambed structure development. Bed load movement strongly depends on streambed conditions of mountain streams. For channels with well-developed streambed structures, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> mainly move in intermittent saltation, and almost no other motion form occur, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate is often very low under this condition. For channels with partially-developed streambed structure, saltation motion is still the main motion form, and contact motion also occurs. When no streambed structure develops (plane bed), both saltation and contact motion occur, contact motion gradually become the main motion form, and if flow intensity and incoming sediment reach the critical high values, laminated load motion occur and will be the main part of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport. In essence, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport and streambed structures both form flow resistance (dissipate flow energy) and are inter-restricted. For a specific stream power, the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate is inversely proportional to the development degree of streambed structures in a logarithmic coordinate system for the same stream reach...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effects of}} boulder {{concentration}} on hydrodynamics and local and reach-averaged sediment transport properties with a flow over submerged boulder arrays are investigated. Four numerical simulations are performed in which the boulders' streamwise spacings are varied. Statistics of near-bed velocity, Reynolds shear stresses, and turbulent events are collected and used to predict <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rates. The results demonstrate {{that the presence of}} boulders at various interboulder spacings altered the flow field in their vicinity causing (1) flow deceleration, wake formation, and vortex shedding; (2) enhanced outward and inward interaction turbulence events downstream of the boulders; and (3) a redistribution of the local bed shear stress around the boulder consisting of pockets of high and low bed shear stresses. The spatial variety of the predicted <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate qs based on local bed shear stress is visualized and is shown to depend greatly on the boulder concentration. Quantitative <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport calculations demonstrate that the reach-averaged <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate may be overestimated by up to 25 times when including the form-drag-generated shear stress of the immobile boulders in the chosen <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> formula. Further, the reach-averaged <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate may be underestimated by 11 % if the local variability of the bed shear stress is not accounted for. Finally, it is shown that for the small-spaced boulder array, the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rates should no longer be predicted using a normal distribution with standard deviation of the shear stress distribution σ...|$|R

The wash load is almost entirely made up of grains that are not found in quantity in the <b>bed.</b> Wash <b>load</b> grains tend to be very small (mostly clays and silts, but also some fine sands) and therefore have a small settling velocity, being kept in suspension by the flow turbulence.

40|$|Tide-driven <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> {{transport}} is {{an important}} portion o f the net annual sediment transport rate in many shoreface and shelf environments. However, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport under waves cannot be measured {{in the field and}} <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport by currents without waves is barely measurable, even in spring tidal conditions. There is, consequently, a strong lack of field data and validated models. The present field site was on the shoreface and inner shelf at 2 to 8. 5 km offshore the central Dutch coast (far outside the surfzone), where tidal currents flow parallel to the coast. Bed load transports were carefully measured with a calibrated sampler in spring tidal conditions without waves at a water depth of 13 - 18 m with fine and medium sands. The near-bed flow was measured over nearly a year and used for integration to annual transport rates. An empirical <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> model was derived, which predicts <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transports that are a factor o f> 5 smaller than predicted by existing models. However, they agree with laboratory data of sand and gravel transport in currents near incipient motion. The damped transport rates may have been caused by cohesion of sediment or turbulence damping due to mud or biological activity. The annual <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate was calculated using a probability density function (pdf) derived from the near-bed current and orbital velocity data which represented the current and wave climate well when compared to 30 years o f data from a nearby wave station.

40|$|Bed {{forms of}} various kinds that evolve {{naturally}} {{on the bottom of}} sandy coasts and rivers are a result of the kinematics of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport. Based on the group motion of particles in the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> within the bottom layer, a study on the nonlinear dynamics of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport is presented in this paper. It is found that some development stages, such as the initiation, the equilibrium sediment transport, and the transition from a smooth bed to sand dunes, can be accounted for by different states in the nonlinear system of the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport. It is verified by comparison with experimental data reported by Laboratoire Nationae D'Hydraulique, Chatou, France, that the evolution from a smooth bed to sand dunes is determined by mutation in the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport.

Two sets of data from laboratory experiments on braided networks performed at the University of Trento (Italy) and at the University of Alberta (Canada) {{provide the basis for}} development of a dimensionless <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> function and for testing a simple predictive model. Measured total sediment transport rates (time-averaged) at equilibrium channel configuration collapse to a single dimensionless relationship based on dimensionless stream power. Bed load fluxes predicted by the Parker and Bagnold functions and cross-section average hydraulic parameters under-predict the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> flux, particularly at low shear stress. This is consistent with previous observation and theory demonstrating the significant influence of transverse variability of the hydraulic parameters in controlling and predicting <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> flux. A simple method for adjusting for this lateral variation is proposed for computing the sediment transport rate using topographic cross-sections of braided rivers. Results show good agreement with the measured values, suggesting that simple assumptions combined with the mean morphology of the channel may be sufficient to estimate mean <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> flux. Model predictions also highlight the significance of active bed width, rather than bed shear stress, as a fundamental ingredient in the prediction of the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> rate and therefore, as an important morphological property to be modelled.
