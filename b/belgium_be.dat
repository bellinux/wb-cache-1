40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed to}} explore {{clinical}} and care-related 'factors associated with fulfilling cancer patients' preference for home death across four countries: <b>Belgium</b> (<b>BE),</b> the Netherlands (NL), Italy (IT), and Spain (ES). Methods: A mortality follow-back study was undertaken from 2009 to 2011 via representative networks of general practitioners (GPs). The study included all patients aged 18 and over who had died of cancer and whose home death preference and place of death were known by the GP. Factors associated with meeting home death preference were tested using multivariable logistic regressions. Results: Among 2, 048 deceased patients, preferred and actual place of death was known in 42. 6 percent of cases. Home death preference met ranged from 65. 5 to 90. 9 percent. Country-specific factors included older age in BE, and decision-making capacity and being female in the NL. GPs' provision of palliative care was positively associated with meeting home death preference. Odds ratios (ORs) were: BE: 9. 9 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] 3. 7 - 26. 6); NL: 9. 7 (2. 4 - 39. 9); and IT: 2. 6 (1. 2 - 5. 5).

40|$|This study {{examines}} the pillarised and partitocratic nature of Belgian political parties via an empirical overview {{of their party}} on the ground. Two main research questions guide the study: To what extent can party membership figures in <b>Belgium</b> <b>be</b> considered as ideal-typical of pillarised or partitocratic parties? And how does {{the social and political}} profile of party members in Belgium correspond to what one might expect from pillarised or partitocratic parties? The study relies on two types of data set: party membership figures since WWII and membership survey data of the four ‘dominant’ relatives in each party family in Belgium. The article shows contradicting results. Although party membership figures have nuanced the idea of partitocratic and pillar parties, the analysis of the profile of party members has produced more conclusive results. The members of some parties (PS, CD&V) still display a strong encapsulation in their sociological world, report specific reasons for joining, as well as lower levels of activism than in other parties. The pillar parties in Belgium seem to have reached a paradoxical situation in which their anchorage in civil society is still very strong, yet it relies on a shrinking social basis. These results raise the question of the incentives that parties offer to their party on the ground to mobilise citizens for participation. They indicate a need to look more systematically and empirically at this neglected aspect of party organisation, as it provides important information for the debate on party declineinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Background/Objectives: A {{standardized}} methodology {{is important}} to enable consistent monitoring of dietary intake across European countries. For this reason, we evaluated the comparability of the assessment of usual food intake collected with two non-consecutive computerized 24 -h dietary recalls (24 -HDRs) and a food propensity questionnaire (FPQ) among five European centers. Subjects/Methods: Two 24 -HDRs using EPIC-Soft (the software developed to conduct 24 -HDRs in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Study) were performed to determine fish, fruit and vegetable (FV) consumed by 600 adults in <b>Belgium</b> (<b>BE),</b> the Czech Republic (CZ), France (FR), the Netherlands (NL) and Norway (NO) in a validation study. An FPQ was used to identify non-consumers. Information from the 24 -HDRs and FPQ were used to estimate individual usual food intake by the Multiple Source Method (MSM). Blood samples were drawn to determine fatty acids in phospholipids and serum carotenoids as biomarkers of fish, and FV intake, respectively. Results: The pooled correlation between usual fish intake and eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid in phospholipids was 0. 19 in men and 0. 31 in women (P for heterogeneity > 0. 50) and center-specific correlations ranged between 0. 08 (CZ) and 0. 28 (BE and NO) in men, and between 0. 19 (BE) and 0. 55 (FR) in women. For usual FV intake, the pooled correlation with serum carotenoids was 0. 31 in men and 0. 40 in women (P for heterogeneity > 0. 10); the center-specific correlations varied between 0. 07 (NO) and 0. 52 (FR) in men, and between 0. 25 (NL) and 0. 45 (NO) in women.

40|$|It is in {{the best}} {{interest}} of a society that its judiciary thrives, and vice versa. From that standpoint, the judicial image and the profile that are being cultivated by the competent authorities in <b>Belgium,</b> <b>be</b> it under the influence of international and supranational legal instruments, present some serious flaws. It would be inappropriate to intensify the existing New Public Management (NPM) approach in order to increase the Belgian judiciary’s accountability. At any rate, in all matters legal it has become more necessary than ever to reflect on human nature, since it seems to be in the “interest” of those advocating “big government” to cultivate anthropological pessimism and, doing so, to sow anxiety and restraint. Discipline however ideally amounts to self-discipline, and, as matters stand, the degree of individual and collective confidence on the part of the judiciary, as well as a willingness on the part of the other state authorities to play a more reticent role, are too little in evidence to justify an unqualified sense of optimism. To stake everything on the NPM model merely appears likely to worsen the situation, precisely because of its inadequate conception of human nature (‘homo economicus’). At a more fundamental level, there should be an awareness that, as the “public service par excellence”, the administration of justice remains vulnerable to political colonization, particularly in view of certain trends which are related to the evermore complex nature of our society. Unless judges remain sufficiently aware of their well-understood role in a democratic society based on the rule of law, and unless they are being genuinely empowered, Belgian judges may well end up being the pliant decision machines which individuals or groups harboring totalitarian aspirations already dream of. A virtue ethical correction of the existing framework may prove most valuable to help preventing such outcome. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Guidelines on {{pediatric}} {{palliative care}} underline that {{care at the}} end of life of chronically ill children should preferably be provided in the child’s home situation. Till present, no European data at population level are available for place of death of children. The aim of this study was to compare proportions of home death for children in six European countries and investigate relation between place of death and sociodemographic and clinical factors. Method: Data were collected from death certificates of all deceased children aged 1 - 17 in <b>Belgium</b> (<b>BE),</b> the Netherlands (NL), Norway (NO), England (E), Wales (W) (2003) and Italy (IT) (2002). Gender, cause (cancer, natural non-cancer and external) and place of death (home vs. outside home) and sociodemographic factors (socio-economic status (SES), degree of urbanization and number of hospital beds in the area) were included in the analyses. Data were analyzed using frequencies and multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 3. 187 deaths were included in the analyses, 534 (16, 8 %) died from cancer. The proportion of home deaths was 19, 6 % (IT), 20, 5 % (E), 20, 6 % (W), 21, 0 % (NO), 23, 8 % (BE) and 28, 6 % (NL). Home death was more likely for children dying from cancer in BE, NL, E and W, for children with high SES in BE, in areas with low number of hospital beds in IT, and for boys in NL. Conclusion: The proportion of home deaths for children differs between studied countries. In most, but not all, countries children dying from cancer had better odds of dying at home than those not dying from cancer. Although acknowledging the influence of culture in the differences, studying care provisions in countries with higher proportions of home deaths, particularly in chronically ill children, can be helpful to identify factors facilitating terminally ill children to die at home. Early involvement of palliative care and equal access to these services can be important in this context. Funding: IWT-Flanders...|$|E
40|$|The study {{objective}} was to compare the prevalence of alcohol and (il) licit drugs in seriously injured drivers in <b>Belgium</b> (<b>BE)</b> and the Netherlands (NL). Injured car and van drivers admitted to the emergency departments of five hospitals in Belgium and three in the Netherlands from January 2008 to May 2010 were included. Blood samples were taken and analysed for ethanol (with an enzymatic method) and 22 other psychoactive substances (UPLC—MS/MS or GC—MS). In total 535 injured drivers {{were included in the}} study (BE: 348; NL: 187). More drivers were found positive for alcohol and drugs in Belgium (52. 6 %) than in the Netherlands (33. 9 %). Alcohol ([more or equal]. 1 g/L) was the most prevalent substance in both countries (BE: 42. 5 %; NL: 29. 6 %). A similar prevalence was found for amphetamine (BE: 2. 6 %; NL: 2. 2 %) and cocaine (BE: 2. 3 %; NL: 2. 1 %). In the Netherlands almost no positive findings for cannabis were recorded (0. 5 %). No driver tested positive for benzodiazepines in the Netherlands compared to 7. 3 % in Belgium. More injured drivers tested positive for Z-drugs (BE: 1. 8 %; NL: 0. 5 %) and medicinal opioids (BE: 3. 3 %; NL: 0. 5 %) in Belgium. The prevalence of alcohol in seriously injured drivers was 12 % higher found in Belgium than in the Netherlands. The prevalence of drugs was similar in both countries except for THC and medicinal drugs, particularly benzodiazepines, with a much higher prevalence in Belgium. In comparison to previous survey there were differences in the prevalence of THC, benzodiazepines and combinations of drugs. Possible explanations are the different matrix used, a bias in study population, or in case of illicit opiates and benzodiazepines a different consumption pattern in the two countries. Alcohol is still the most prevalent substance among the injured driver population and this increased the last 15 years. (Author/publisher...|$|E
