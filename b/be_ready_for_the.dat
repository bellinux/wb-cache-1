5|$|Doom 3 {{was also}} {{intended}} to be more storyline focused than previous id titles, as was demonstrated by the developers' conscious effort to have more professional voice acting. Late in 2002, two employees at ATI Technologies leaked a development version of Doom 3 onto the Internet. One year later, a new trailer was shown at E3 2003 and soon afterwards id Software's website was updated to showcase Doom 3 as an upcoming project, although it was also announced that Doom 3 would not <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2003 holiday season. According to John Carmack, the development took longer than expected.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{contacts}} Flynn, {{telling him}} that anti-venom will <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the controls of the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane {{makes it to the}} terminal. The passengers leave the plane and anti-venom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a ballistic vest. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E
5|$|With a team {{in place}} and a stadium under construction, the Nashville Sounds were set to begin play in 1978 as an {{expansion}} team of the Southern League. As the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds, the Sounds played their first game on April 15, 1978, against the Memphis Chicks at Memphis' Tim McCarver Stadium, which they lost, 4–2. The Sounds recorded their first win the next evening, defeating Memphis, 3–0. Meanwhile, construction on Greer Stadium continued in order to <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> home opener. The team had requested to open the season {{on the road and}} had to swap a series with the Chattanooga Lookouts in order to have enough time to complete the stadium. On April 26, the Sounds played their first home game, a 12–4victory, against the Savannah Braves in front of a sellout crowd of 8,156fans. The Greer home opener was scheduled to take place the previous evening, but was rained out. Tractors and grading machines were still preparing the field on game day, and the electricity was turned on only five minutes before the gates opened. Much of the sod that been laid that winter died, and the replacement sod arrived late, leaving it to be laid the day before the scheduled opening game. The Sounds finished their inaugural 1978 season under manager Chuck Goggin with a 64–77 record and failed to win either half of the Southern League's split-season, leaving them out of the championship playoffs. Bruce Berenyi was selected as the league's Most Outstanding Pitcher.|$|E

5|$|In 1930 the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} the West Indies which included four Test matches—the first Tests to be played in the West Indies. The MCC side was not at full international strength; it included players who were either just beginning or just ending their international careers, and several star English bowlers were missing. The first Test was played in Barbados and St Hill was selected, making his debut for the West Indies on 11 February 1930. He scored 0 and 12 with the bat, took two for 110 from 35 overs in the first innings and was wicketless in the second. The match was drawn. The MCC then travelled to Trinidad and played the cricket team in two games. St Hill played in the first, taking four wickets, but was rested from the second. The Trinidad Sporting Chronicle stated that he was omitted specifically to <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second Test, also played in Trinidad, although he had not asked for a rest. The newspaper questioned why he had then been left out of the team for the Test match, and reported speculation that his omission was for political reasons to discredit the leadership of George Dewhurst, the Trinidad captain in the second game. It suggested that, given his ability with bat and ball, St Hill was worth a net 100 runs to any team in which he played. Having been omitted from the second Test, which West Indies lost, St Hill played in the third in British Guiana. West Indies won the game; St Hill batted at number eleven in the batting order in his first innings, at number five in the second and scored three runs in each innings. With the ball, he took only one wicket and did not play another Test. A review of the series in the Barbados Advocate suggested that St Hill bowled steadily during both his Test appearances, but that his economical bowling figures in British Guiana were slightly unrepresentative as the English batsmen had been concentrating entirely on defence. The article stated that St Hill was more effective on matting pitches than on turf, but that he had many supporters in Trinidad. It believed he warranted a place on the forthcoming West Indian tour of Australia, but that he needed to work on his fielding, which was weak.|$|E

The 1945–46 season was its only full campaign. Records from this time tend not to be included in official records.
