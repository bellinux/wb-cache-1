5|$|After Wallis had {{finished}} the initial manuscript for The Road to Total Freedom, he provided representatives of Scientology leadership with a copy. Wallis negotiated with the Scientology leaders, and it was agreed upon that certain sections of the book would <b>be</b> <b>edited.</b> In total, approximately 100 sections of the book were edited due to input from Scientology leaders. This fact was not made public {{at the time of}} the book's publication.|$|E

5|$|The series began {{broadcasting}} on 11 October 2004 on BBC One {{during the}} 9 to 10pm timeslot, {{and continued on}} every Monday night until 13 December 2004. The second to ninth episodes were pre-empted on Saturday nights, starting 16 October 2004, on digital channel BBC Three. In the United States the series began broadcast on the A Network, where it is known as MI-5, {{from the start of}} 2005. However, because each episode last approximately an hour, 15 minutes had to <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> out on each to accommodate for advert breaks. However, the DVD release of the series in the United States included the episodes unedited.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th {{century the}} ideals of the Western European Enlightenment and the French Revolution became widely known to the Greek scholars. They soon {{realized}} the potential of these new ideals, and especially of popular freedom and sovereignty for their own national struggle against Ottoman rule. Adamantios Korais, a humanist scholar and leading figure of the modern Greek Enlightenment, had stressed the desirability of a printed medium, written in the vernacular language, in order to spread these ideas to the Greek people, that lived in the Ottoman Empire and the Diaspora in Western Europe as well. Korais explained about the necessity of a periodical that would gather material from political and philological newspapers of the enlightened peoples of Europe and contain reports from Ottoman-ruled Greece. He also stressed that this should <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> by a man of learning, and proposed that his friend Anthimos Gazis, scholar and Orthodox priest in Vienna, would be the most suitable person.|$|E

5000|$|Best European Fiction is {{an annual}} {{anthology}} of European short stories published by Dalkey Archive Press since 2010.

5|$|Once {{the filming}} was completed, more than 20 two-hour Beta SP video tapes of footage had to <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> down {{to fit the}} actions of the game. The {{programming}} included editing the original video footage, and mixing the rendered images of doors, drawers, chairs and other objects into the footage frame-by-frame, which was necessary for more than 100 scenes. The game required more polishing and fine-tuning than most games of its time due to the many video components, and the programmers had to determine the desired frame rate, data transfer rate and desired resolution of the video elements. Another challenge for the game was CD resource management. Since many of the scenes in the game could be repeated in multiple chapters, some pieces of the code were written onto several different CDs {{to reduce the number of}} times the player had to swap discs in the middle of a chapter, an unusual practice for computer games at the time. The final game was on seven discs, a large number for a computer game, and more than the four or five discs originally expected.|$|E
5|$|Porter was {{interested}} in reforming the sport of horse racing, and expended much effort in the newspaper trying to bring together horsemen in the {{various parts of the}} country. Although the effort did not bear fruit, the Spirit became a repository for information of interest to those involved in horse racing, printing statistics and results of races. Porter was also involved in attempts to publish an American stud book for race horses in the United States, similar to the General Stud Book that was published in England documenting the pedigrees of Thoroughbred horses. In February 1837, Porter announced in the Spirit the projected coverage of the project, which was to <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> by Wiley Jones Stratton, who was secretary to the National Jockey Club in Washington, D. C. But this project never materialized, and Porter turned to Patrick Nesbitt Edgar in January 1838 to take over the project. But Edgar did not finish the work, and by 1842, the project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The {{engineering}} set {{did provide}} some challenges; a {{health and safety}} brief was required for the actors on it as it was still raised off the ground. Furthermore, {{the results of the}} bubbles being sent through water tubes that represented part of the engine core created noise issues for the sound technicians; they asked for it to be turned off whenever it wasn't placed in shot. One of the special effects went wrong, causing an actual explosion behind Jeri Ryan rather than simply creating sparks following the weapons fire which would <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> in during post-optical effects. The explosion remained in the final cut. The final day of the shoot took place on March 10; taking the filming period to eight days, a day longer than normal for Voyager episodes. It took place on the set of the Dauntless bridge, in the orange color scheme. The final full scene filmed was of the scene {{at the end of the}} episode where the Dauntless returns to Borg space and Arturis realises he is about to be assimilated, and after an hour of closeups for various scenes, the shoot ended at 12:50am on March 11.|$|E
5000|$|Hans Fredrik Dahl was the {{superior}} editor {{of all four}} volumes. The first volume, En samfunnsmakt blir til. 1660-1880 <b>was</b> <b>edited</b> by Martin Eide.

5|$|The film used Technicolor's Oz process during post-production. This is {{a partial}} silver {{retention}} on the interpositive, similar to bleach bypass, {{which will be}} used to lend to the sense of detachment from the modern world McG was looking for. Industrial Light & Magic developed shader programs to make the desaturated lighting of the CGI realistic and well-integrated to the on-set footage. The filmmakers consulted with many scientists about the effects of an abandoned world and nuclear winter. McG cited , the original Star Wars trilogy and Children of Men, as well as the novel The Road, as his visual influences. He instructed his cast to read the latter as well as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Like Children of Men, McG would storyboard scenes so that it would <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> together to resemble a seamless, continuous shot. It took two weeks to film a two-minute shot of Connor getting caught up in a bombing on the Skynet base where he discovers plans for the T-800.|$|E
5|$|The {{necessary}} use of heuristics {{for multiple}} alignment means that for an arbitrary set of proteins, {{there is always}} a good chance that an alignment will contain errors. For example, an evaluation of several leading alignment programs using the BAliBase benchmark found that at least 24% of all pairs of aligned amino acids were incorrectly aligned. These errors can arise because of unique insertions into one or more regions of sequences, or through some more complex evolutionary process leading to proteins that do not align easily by sequence alone. As the number of sequence and their divergence increases many more errors will be made simply because of the heuristic nature of MSA algorithms. Multiple sequence alignment viewers enable alignments to be visually reviewed, often by inspecting the quality of alignment for annotated functional sites on two or more sequences. Many also enable the alignment to <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> to correct these (usually minor) errors, in order to obtain an optimal 'curated' alignment suitable for use in phylogenetic analysis or comparative modeling.|$|E
5|$|Thomas enjoyed Fabian's {{performance}} in the episode, arguing {{that it was an}} example of the actor's scene stealer quality that led Thomas to initially cast him after his appearance in an episode of his earlier series Cupid. The scene in which Keith boards the ship on which Hank is located was difficult to film because there were limited daylight filming hours. The crew thought it was important for the audience to see the waves and the ocean. However, they were unable to finish filming the scene within the course of one day, so the crew made a quick decision to place a makeshift blue screen as part of the background for the interior of the boat. It was intended that the blue screen <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> in post-production in order to represent the ocean, but upon learning that this change would cost millions of dollars, the crew decided to forgo the alteration and instead pass off the blue screen as a tarpaulin.|$|E
