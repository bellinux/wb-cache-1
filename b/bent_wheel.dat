5000|$|Roland Stobbart {{was born}} at Aspatria, Cumberland, England in 1909; the eldest of two sons to an haulage contractor. Even before he reached {{maturity}} one Cumberland newspaper was describing him as, [...] "probably the finest racing motorcyclist in Cumberland. A clever, daring rider who does not {{know the meaning of}} the word fear." [...] He was at that time attached to the Workington Motor Cycling Club. By the age of twenty he had met with considerable success on Dirt tracks and Grasstracks throughout the north of England and had successfully taken part in sand races in Scotland. When they introduced grass track racing at Whitehaven he became the principal prize-winner. In 1930 he entered the senior Manx Grand Prix on the Isle of Man, formerly known as the Manx Amateur Motorcycle Road Race. Although he buckled his front wheel half-a-mile from the start he continued the race and the distance of over 200 miles with a soft tyre and a badly <b>bent</b> <b>wheel.</b> His average speed was 64.7 miles per hour, and he did the fastest lap at 68 miles per hour. Stobbart entered the race in the following two years but despite doing good times in the practice laps he failed to complete either of the races. In 1932 he retired after the first lap when he suffered a puncture.|$|E
40|$|International audienceEquipment {{includes}} planter, field management {{equipment and}} harvester for {{controlled traffic farming}} system is elaborated in the paper. And {{the analysis results shows}} that main problems of equipment for controlled traffic farming system contains poor ability to navigate, uneven and <b>bent</b> <b>wheel</b> lanes. To solve the problem, the thought that precision agriculture is introduced into equipment for controlled traffic farming system is put forward. For this purpose, the key technology of precision agriculture is introduced, and the feasibility of combination of precision agriculture and controlled traffic farming system is discussed, which provides theoretical support for the development of equipment for controlled traffic farming system...|$|E
50|$|The American Automobile Association {{estimated}} {{in the five}} years prior to 2016 that 16 million drivers in the United States have suffered damage from potholes to their vehicle including tire punctures, <b>bent</b> <b>wheels,</b> and damaged suspensions with a cost of $3 billion a year. In India, 3,000 people per year are killed in accidents involving potholes. Britain has estimated that the cost of fixing all roads with potholes in the country would cost £12 billion.|$|R
50|$|This British WWII Airborne BSA {{folding bicycle}} was rigged so that, when parachuted, the {{handlebars}} and seat {{were the first}} parts to hit the ground (as <b>bent</b> <b>wheels</b> would disable the bike). BSA abandoned the traditional diamond bicycle design as too weak for the shock and instead made an elliptical frame of twin parallel tubes, one forming the top tube and seat stays, and the other the chainstay and down tube. The hinges were {{in front of the}} bottom bracket and in the corresponding position in front of the saddle, fastened by wing nuts. The peg pedals could be pushed in to avoid snagging and further reduce the space occupied during transit.|$|R
50|$|Fatigue {{cracking}} of {{the tooth}} gullet {{is not as}} common as in band saws, as {{in the majority of}} cases it is a heavier plate gauge and is not <b>bent</b> around band <b>wheels</b> multiple thousands of times per run.|$|R
50|$|He was {{selected}} for the Australian team {{to compete in the}} 2012 International Six Days Enduro competition in Germany from 24 to 29 September, leading the Australian team to second place in the world. After the first couple of days, Price was leading the E3 class and was fifth overall, despite a <b>bent</b> front <b>wheel</b> from the first day. Near the halfway mark of the event, he suffered broken ribs in an incident. He continued despite the injuries, finishing second in the E3 class and tenth overall.|$|R
60|$|As {{the beam}} of {{moonlight}} widened, the figures of the toiling men grew clear. One was clinging {{to the top of}} a tall stanchion in a grotesque monkey-like attitude, trying to cut loose the awning, for a knife sparkled in his hand. Another crouched on the deck with folds of the canvas in his arms. Miguel was <b>bent</b> over the <b>wheel.</b> The tenseness of his pose and his hard-set face suggested heavy muscular strain.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{there was}} a slight commotion on deck. An order, issued from some {{invisible}} depth of the cabin, was so unexpected {{that it had to be}} repeated sternly and peremptorily. A bustle forward ensued, two or three other shadows sprang up by the bulwarks, then the two men <b>bent</b> over the <b>wheel,</b> the Excelsior slowly swung round on her heel, and, with a parting salutation to the coast, bore away to the northwest and the open sea again.|$|R
5000|$|Early models tend {{to offer}} a means of {{securing}} one wheel: these can be a grooved piece of concrete in the ground, a forked piece of metal into which a wheel of the bicycle is pushed, or a horizontal [...] "ladder" [...] providing positions for the front wheel of many bicycles. These are not very effective, since a thief need only detach the wheel in question from the bicycle to free {{the rest of the}} bicycle. They also do not offer much support, and a row of bicycles in this type of stand are susceptible to all being toppled in a domino effect. These types of stand are known as [...] "wheel benders" [...] among cyclists.A modern version is known as the [...] "Sheffield rack" [...] or [...] "Sheffield stand" [...] after the city of Sheffield in England where these were pioneered. These consist of a thick metal bar or tube bent into the shape of a square arch. The top part is about level with the top bar of the bicycle frame, and thus supports the bicycle and allows the frame to be secured. The origin of the racks was when the frugal citizens of Sheffield had {{to decide what to do}} with some old gas piping. Local cyclists suggested the cycle rack idea and two simple bends later, and a little concrete in the ground, the rack was born. At the time this was a revolution in a world of 'single-point holders' that <b>bent</b> <b>wheels</b> and offered little lockability for frames. A version of this design feature a second, lower horizontal bar to support smaller bikes (this version is also known as “A stand”), and are coated to reduce their surface hardness and to not scratch the bike's paintwork.Since 1984 the City of Toronto has installed post and ring bicycle racks consisting of a steel bollard or post topped by a cast aluminium ring. In August 2006, it became publicly known that these stands could be defeated by prying the ring off with a two-by-four.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason the}} War Office wanted such a {{lightweight}} motorcycle {{was to establish}} communications between troops that had been dropped by parachute and the front line forces, who could be some distance away or out of radio contact. The problem was {{how to make sure}} that the Enfield landed without too much damage. In the summer of 1942 experimentation therefore began to develop a protective cradle that would go right round the motorcycle. A number of different versions were tested by dropping them from the bomb racks of aircraft such as the Halifax and Lancaster bombers. As well as surviving the drop, the cradles also had to be easy to remove on landing. The prototypes met neither requirement as they were too light and <b>bent</b> the <b>wheels</b> on impact but eventually a design was developed that worked with heavier tubing and increased bracing and in December 1942, went into production at the Enfield's Calton Hill factory in Edinburgh.|$|R
60|$|She {{bowed to}} Senor Montes, and {{requested}} him {{to enter the}} car. Nels stowed some of the paraphernalia away, making room in the rear seat. Link <b>bent</b> over the <b>wheel.</b> The start was so sudden, with such crack and roar, that the crowd split in wild disorder. Out of the plaza the car ran, gathering headway; down a street lined by white and blue walls; across a square where rebels were building barricades; along a railroad track full of iron flat-cars that carried mounted pieces of artillery; through the outlying guards, who waved to the officer, Montes.|$|R
60|$|Madeline {{heard the}} buzz of the car. Link {{appeared}} driving up the slope. He made a short, sliding turn and stopped before the porch. Link had tied two long, heavy planks upon the car, one on each side, and in every available space he had strapped extra tires. A huge cask occupied one back seat, and another seat was full of tools and ropes. There was just room in this rear part of the car for Nels to squeeze in. Link put Madeline in front beside him, then <b>bent</b> over the <b>wheel.</b> Madeline waved her hand at the silent cowboys on the porch. Not an audible good-by was spoken.|$|R
500|$|During {{the ferocious}} night {{fighting}} that occurred as the High Seas Fleet forced {{its way through}} the British rear, the IV Scouting Group encountered the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron at close range in the darkness. As the two squadrons closed on each other, the Germans illuminated [...] and [...] and concentrated their fire on the two ships. The two ships were badly damaged and set on fire and forced to retreat, while the Germans also fell back in an attempt to bring the British closer to the battlecruisers [...] and [...] In the melee, the cruiser [...] was hit and sunk by a torpedo launched by Southampton, and München nearly collided with the sinking Frauenlob. She managed to evade the wreck, and she then fired a torpedo at Southampton, but it missed. München was hit another three times during this engagement; two of the hits exploded in the water, causing minor splinter damage. The third shell went through the second funnel and exploded on a funnel support on the other side; one of the shell splinters knocked out the starboard rangefinder. The erratic maneuvering <b>bent</b> a <b>wheel</b> shaft in the , forcing her crew to steer the ship from the steering gear compartment for {{about two and a half}} hours.|$|R
60|$|It so {{happened}} {{that there was}} no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on {{the eastern side of the}} harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first to climb aboard. The men working the searchlight, after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the <b>wheel,</b> <b>bent</b> over to examine it, and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run.|$|R
5|$|At that point, Garin was leading, with Émile Georget {{almost two}} hours behind. In the fifth stage, Georget had two flat tires, {{and fell asleep}} when {{he stopped at the}} side of the road to rest; he failed to finish. Thus Garin {{extended}} his lead by winning this stage, carrying nearly three hours' advantage into the final day's racing. Garin had requested other cyclists in the leading group to let him win the stage, but Fernand Augereau refused to do this. Garin then had Lucien Pothier throw down his bicycle in front of Augereau, who fell, and Garin then <b>bent</b> Augereau's rear <b>wheel.</b> Augereau quickly obtained a spare bike and continued to the finish, however Garin easily won the sprint. Augereau still received a prize of 100 francs from Velo-Sport Nantes for the fastest final kilometer of the stage in the Nantes velodrome.|$|R
