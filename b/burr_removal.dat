40|$|Abstract. Deburring {{is a major}} {{bottleneck}} {{in manufacturing}} organizations. Burrs on the milled surface need to be removed and the surface quality must be maintained. Abrasive waterjet (AWJ) {{has been used in}} various operation {{for a wide range of}} materials. But no detailed investigations are known to be carried out on AWJ deburring. An orthogonal experiment is designed to investigate the effects of the AWJ parameters on <b>burr</b> <b>removal</b> and on surface quality. The results show that AWJ can remove the burrs from the stainless-steel specimens effectively under the condition of proper parameters, and the parameters such as abrasive grit size and stand-off distance are important not only for <b>burr</b> <b>removal</b> but also for surface quality, and slurry concentration is another important factor for surface quality...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular stents are {{biomedical}} {{devices for}} the treatment of stenosis problem in the vascular system. Stenosis can be considered as the narrowing of the vessel in a way that creates a block or contraction to blood flow. In order to overcome such blockings, stents are placed and expanded in the narrowing location. Stent manufacturing is vastly done by laser beam machining and requires a good accuracy and control of the process to be successful. Recent studies have assessed nanosecond-pulsed lasers for efficient production in terms of productivity and quality. To achieve the required properties with regard to <b>burr</b> and dross <b>removal,</b> edge rounding and surface finishing, currently chemical etching followed by electrochemical polishing is applied after laser machining. Both from the perspective of process control, speed and repeatability as well as biocompatibility, these chemical finishing processes, using concentrated acids, are far from optimal. Plasma electrolytic polishing (PeP) can provide an alternative, using biocompatible, aqueous solutions and high DC voltages of u > 200 V to establish a vapour skin around the workpiece which leads to the generation of an atmospheric plasma. Here, electrochemical and electrothermal reactions take place which remove burr and dross and smoothen the workpieces' surface. Roughness values of Ra ≥ 0. 02 μm have been achieved. This work presents the study of a novel stent manufacturing route for producing permanent stents in AISI 316 L stainless steel. The stent mesh was microcut employing a ns-pulsed fiber laser. The stents were post-processed via traditional chemical etching and PeP. The results were compared in terms of geometrical integrity and surface roughness...|$|R

In this paper, a new approach for the control of active micromanipulators used for automated edge chamfering and deburring applications is presented. The approach implements a process model into the controller’s correlations and logic mod-ule to provide a basis for determining adjustments in the controlled force levels. Based on sensor data and system/process knowledge, the module makes decisions on what corrective action, if any, is required to ensure <b>burr</b> <b>removal</b> and production of the desired chamfer.

40|$|Deburring {{is a major}} {{bottleneck}} {{in manufacturing}} organisations. In recent years abrasive jet machining has been gaining increasing acceptability for deburring applications. The influence of abrasive jet deburring process parameters is not known clearly. An experimental investigation has been conducted to identify the abrasive jet deburring process parameters and the edge quality of abrasive jet deburred components. For these experiments, an experimental design based on a Taguchi orthogonal array was used to systematically measure {{the influence of the}} major cutting parameters on abrasive jet deburred specimens made of stainless steel. An additional parameter viz. ‘jet height ’ was identified, which latter significantly affects the deburring process. A profile projector was used to measure the edge quality and also visual inspection was conducted to ascertain the surface damage of the specimens. Results of the edge quality measurements supplemented with visual inspection were analyzed by the ANOVA method, as a result of which {{it was found that the}} <b>burr</b> <b>removal</b> was affected by the parameters jet height and angle of impingement. Also a statistical model was developed for the magnitude of the edge radius generated...|$|E
40|$|The burr {{formed in}} {{machining}} processes is an undesired irregularity of material, which has challenged industry and researchers {{up to the}} present. Hitherto, the focus has been put either on <b>burr</b> <b>removal</b> subsequent to the actual machining operation or on avoidance of burr formation during the process. Exemplified on drilling, this paper presents a different approach in which the burr formation is regarded as preventable process. Using laser technology, the surface material on the drill exit area is hardened prior to the drilling operation, whereby the material is being embrittled. In consequence, the burr formation is stopped {{at the point where}} the hardened material begins to deform. Experiments were carried out to identify the influence of key parameters on the drilling result, especially on the burr formation. Based on the experimental investigations, a theoretical model is provided from which feasible hardening parameters for a certain drilling task can be derived. The study is supplemented with a numeric simulation of the drilling process focussing upon the material behavior. Furthermore, a profitability assessment of this new approach is part of this paper...|$|E
40|$|For {{the face}} milling process, many {{algorithms}} {{have been developed}} to optimize the tool path with respect to the burr formation process, and to predict the occurrence of burrs. However, collecting data to create the factual knowledge base for face milling burr expert systems has long been seen as too costly and time consuming due to the many parameters that influence the burr formation process in the face milling operation. A suitably designed part that captures in essence the distinguishing mechanisms of burr formation can be very beneficial in reducing the number of experiments performed. This paper describes the geometry of a workpiece and the machining strategy employed to generate the distinct face milling burr formation mechanisms. Measurement is limited to burr size parameters that directly influence the functionality of the workpiece edge and the ease of <b>burr</b> <b>removal</b> in further processing. The burr data collected after machining the specially designed workpiece is stored in the database. The database is designed using an Entity-Relationship model. This high level conceptual model helps structure the data in a fashion that renders this database highly suitable for planning applications. The database is designed to handle the most important queries raised by a process planner. For example, identifying insert materials that generate the smallest burrs for a given workpiece material, and so forth. The database also directly interfaces with the optimization programs like burr prediction and tool path planning that were developed for burr minimization in face milling. In addition, this database {{can be used as a}} standalone system, i. e. a "burr expert", to recommend cutting parameters or tools for a specific material...|$|E
40|$|Removal of burrs at cross-drilled hole intersections {{is often}} tedious and {{expensive}} due to limited accessibility. Automated edge finishing of crossholes has been practiced successfully using robot-assisted, flexible abrasive brush deburring, and non-traditional, mass finishing {{methods such as}} electrochemical deburring (ECD), abrasive slurry, and thermal deburring. These methods are very efficient but most require specialized equipment and dedicated cleaning operations to remove chemicals or trapped brush bristles. The Orbitool is an on-line, localized deburring alternative to brushes recently developed by JWDone Company. The Orbitool is a mechanized cutting tool with carbide edges specifically designed for crosshole deburring. Mechanized cutting provides greater selectivity and control of dimensional specifications compared to brushing and mass finishing methods. Furthermore, it can be implemented using existing machine tool equipment and cleaning procedures. As with any deburring tool, its desired capability is <b>burr</b> <b>removal</b> in the shortest time possible while meeting dimensional and surface quality requirements. To this end, process maps of chamfer width and surface roughness of the deburred edges, plotted against process parameters, were developed in this study. Workpieces consisted of Al 6061 T 6 bars with zero-offset, perpendicular cross-holes with a diameter of 7. 94 mm (5 / 16 in.). The experiments were conducted using Orbitools with a diameter of 6. 35 mm (1 / 4 in.) and 36 cutting edges. The effect of the process inputs and their mutual interaction was assessed using Taguchi methods. The results show that proper selection of process parameters yield consistent and effective removal of burrs at cross-drilled intersections while achieving surface roughness values that range from 15 to 65 ?m at the chamfers...|$|E
40|$|In the {{aerospace}} industry, <b>burr</b> <b>removal</b> {{is a very}} important part of the manufacturing process. Stacks of material on sections of an aircraft are assembled and drilled by hand. Due to extensive burr formation the sheets must be destacked so that burrs can be removed and then the stacks are reassembled and fastened together. If burrs are minimized in the drilling process, this would reduce the necessity for the sheets to be destacked and deburred. One approach to minimizing burrs is to lower the thrust force in drilling through suitable modification of the drill geometry such as the use of a step drill. Although prior researchers have analyzed different drill geometries such as step drills and their effect on hole exit burr formation in the drilling process through experimentation, no work has been reported on modeling and analysis of step drilling forces and their relationship to burr formation as a function of the step drill geometry parameters. Consequently, this thesis focuses on the modeling of the thrust force and torque for step drills and analyzes their relationship with burr size as a function of the step drill geometry parameters. In the first step, a mechanistic model for thrust and torque in drilling is implemented for a standard twist drill. This mechanistic model is then adapted to predict the thrust and torque for a step drill. Subsequently, experiments are performed to validate the mechanistic model and to evaluate burr formation with standard and step drills. The influence of thrust and torque on hole exit burr formation is analyzed for different step drill geometries and experimental feeds and speeds. The results show that the predicted thrust and torque values for both drill geometries are in good agreement with measured values, although the torque model consistently underpredicts. For standard drill geometry in the calibration tests, the average error in the thrust prediction is 7. 09 % and the average error in the torque prediction is - 18. 05 %. In validation tests, the average error for predicted thrust is 2. 29 % and the average error for predicted torque is - 18. 46 %. For the step drill model the average error in thrust is 0. 72 % while the average error in torque is - 8. 72 %. In addition, a reduction in the predicted thrust force for a step drill relative to the standard twist drill is found to correlate well with a reduction in the measured burr size. However, further reduction in the thrust force by varying the step angle and diameter ratio do not correlate well with the measured burr size. Likely reasons for these results are presented in this thesis. MSCommittee Chair: Shreyes Melkote; Committee Member: Steven Danyluk; Committee Member: Steven Lian...|$|E
