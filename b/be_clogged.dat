25|$|The Burmese {{battle plan}} was greatly shaped by their {{experience}} in the 1759–1760 war. First, they would avoid a single pronged attack route along the narrow Gulf of Siam coastline, which they discovered, could easily <b>be</b> <b>clogged</b> up by more numerous Siamese forces. In 1760, the Burmese were forced to spend nearly three months (January–March) to fight {{their way out of}} the coastline. This time, they planned a multi-pronged attack from all sides to stretch out the numerically superior Siamese defences.|$|E

2500|$|... "Mini V-brakes" [...] (or [...] "mini V's") are V-brakes with shorter arms, {{typically}} between 8 and 9 centimeters. This {{reduces the}} required cable pull, making them compatible with brake levers intended for cantilever brakes. Mini V-brakes retain advantages specific to V-brakes such as not requiring extra cable stops. On the downside, their shorter arms provide very small tyre and wheel clearance and generally {{make for a}} less forgiving setup: they can only accommodate smaller tyre sizes compared to cantilever brakes, may pose problems for mounting fenders, can <b>be</b> <b>clogged</b> more easily by mud, and {{they can make it}} harder to change wheels.|$|E
2500|$|Improvements to {{the lake}} were carried out in 1786 under the {{direction}} of Mr Marson the estate manager. The 4th Duke of Newcastle built a cascade below the bridge in 1823, and a new one in 1835, when the work was completed by Mr Grey. The duke described the construction as [...] "ingenious and well managed." [...] There were problems in 1842, when the culvert feeding water from the lake to an engine which supplied water to the house was found to <b>be</b> <b>clogged</b> with fine tree roots. In spring 1845, 1846 and 1847, the duke drained the lake to make it wider and to improve the banks, which he felt looked [...] "neither natural nor handsome" [...] in places.|$|E

Stevens referred to the Internet as [...] "not a big truck," [...] but a [...] "series of tubes" [...] that could <b>be</b> <b>clogged</b> with information. Stevens also confused the terms Internet and e-mail. Soon after, Stevens's interpretation of how the Internet works became a topic of amusement and ridicule in the blogosphere.

Consider, And what comfort {{can such}} a man have who has, by his discontent and unruly carriages, brought himself, in this manner, to his end; he has brought himself to shame, his {{profession}} to shame, his friends to shame, and his name to contempt and scorn. Bad men rejoice at his fall; good men cannot own him, weak men stumble at him; besides, his cause will not bear him out; his heart will <b>be</b> <b>clogged</b> with guilt; innocency and boldness will take wings and fly from him. Though he talketh of religion upon the stage52 or ladder, that will blush to hear its name mentioned by them that suffer for evil-doing. Wherefore, my brethren, my friends, my enemies, and all men, what religion, profession, or opinion soever you hold, fear God, honour the king, and do that duty to both which is required of you by the Word and law of Christ, and then, to say no more, you shall not suffer by the power for evil-doing.|$|E
60|$|The lovely dawn: {{the lovely}} pure, wide {{morning in the}} mid-sea, so golden-aired and delighted, with the sea like sequins shaking, and the sky far, far, far above, unfathomably clear.

Ah if one could sail for ever, on a small quiet, lonely ship, from land to land and isle to isle, and saunter through the spaces of this lovely world, always through the spaces of this lovely world. Sweet it would be {{sometimes}} to come to the opaque earth, to block oneself against the stiff land, to annul the vibration of one's flight against the inertia of our terra firma! but life itself would be in the flight, the tremble of space. Ah the trembling of never-ended space, as one moves in flight! Space, and the frail vibration of space, the glad lonely wringing of the heart. Not to <b>be</b> <b>clogged</b> to the land any more. Not to be any more like a donkey with a log on its leg, fastened to weary earth that has no answer now. But to be off.|$|E

Should he do this and advance steadily for a while, he needs not fear any deviations from the truth which will be finally injurious to him. He will not long have his admiration fixed upon unworthy objects; he will neither <b>be</b> <b>clogged</b> nor drawn aside by the love of friends or kindred, betraying his understanding through his affections; he will neither be bowed down by conventional arrangements of manners producing too often a lifeless decency; nor will the rock of his spirit wear away in the endless beating of the waves of the world; neither will that portion of his own time, which he must surrender to labours by which his livelihood is to be earned or his social duties performed, be unprofitable to himself indirectly, while it is directly useful to others; for that time has been primarily surrendered through an act of obedience to a moral law established by himself, and therefore he moves them also along the orbit of perfect liberty.|$|E
