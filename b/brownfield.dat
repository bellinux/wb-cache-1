5|$|The New England Quarter is a mixed-use {{development}} {{in the city of}} Brighton and Hove, England. It was built between 2004 and 2008 on the largest <b>brownfield</b> site in the city, adjacent to Brighton railway station.

5|$|In April 2002, Specht Properties was {{selected}} as the developer of the project after scoring higher with the council appointed committee formed to rate each of three developer's proposals, with Gerding/Edlen Development and Trammell Crow Company losing out to Specht. Construction on the complex began in June 2003 when an old grain store at the site was demolished {{to make room for the}} center. A total of eight buildings were torn down to make room the complex as part of a redevelopment of a <b>brownfield</b> site.|$|E
5|$|The East End is {{the area}} closest to the {{original}} Port of London, known for its high immigrant population, {{as well as for}} being one of the poorest areas in London.

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the issue of <b>brownfields</b> in urban environments and is focused on <b>brownfields</b> in Brno. The {{potential}} of <b>brownfields</b> is presented on a concrete example of the revitalization. In a work was chosen <b>brownfields</b> located in the city of Brno. Then was created the project of its revitalization. This <b>brownfields</b> is located in the Pisárecké Valley between the Anthropos Pavilion and the recreation area of the Riviera. Project is made in two versions. The first variant deals only with area of this <b>brownfields,</b> the second variant deals with this <b>brownfields</b> and its closed areal. This area was also previously led as a <b>brownfields</b> area. The revitalization project is based on historical and qualitative dispositions of the com-plex. Also take into account the spatial plan of Brno and the results of the survey. A visual design of the <b>brownfields</b> revitalizations was created using AutoCAD software to compare the situation before and after the revitalizations.

5|$|Essex {{has one of}} {{the longest}} coastlines of any English county, with saltmarshes, lagoons, mudflats, grazing marshes, reedbeds and shingle. Its ancient forests were {{formerly}} important to the local economy, with wood being used for fuel, construction and bark in the tanning industry. Coppicing is being re-introduced by the EWT to encourage woodland grasses, flowers, invertebrates and birds. A few grasslands on the heavy clays of south- and mid-Essex are still grazed according to traditional methods, supporting a mixture of pasture and fen. Some <b>brownfield</b> sites, often on contaminated soil, have populations of nationally scarce species, particularly invertebrates.|$|E

40|$|Differences between <b>brownfields</b> and redeveloped {{sites in}} the Ostrava {{metropolitan}} area are subject to analysis in this paper. Environmental burden and former functional use were identified as statistically significant characteristics of such differences. In addition, relations between selected attributes of <b>brownfields</b> and redeveloped sites were analyzed using the "if-then" decision rules of the rough set method. In this way, the research demonstrated the significance of spatial aspects and identified two fundamental types of <b>brownfields</b> in the model area. The first type is represented by agricultural <b>brownfields</b> in the hinterland zone, that are characterized by a complicated ownership structure. <b>Brownfields</b> of the second type are located particularly {{in the inner city}} morphogenetic zone, and are characterized by potential problems with environmental burden. In this context, <b>brownfields</b> and redeveloped sites differ respectively in the combination of these characteristics...|$|R

5|$|Since Innogy plc {{was taken}} over by RWE in 2002, the site has been owned by RWE Npower. The only {{substantial}} structures remaining are the National Grid and NEDL substations. These buildings will continue to remain and there are plans to extend the National Grid substation. The rest of the power station site is unused <b>brownfield</b> land. The site of the main station buildings is currently covered in crushed concrete, left over from the demolition process. Underground workings, such as tunnels and culverts, also still exist on the site. The coal storage area to the north has been tarmaced and ash settling ponds have been filled with concrete. Some ash mounds are still situated to the east of the site.|$|E

The focal point is a piazza and landscaped park, which stretches to the ship canal around which the buildings are located. The piazza's two distinct areas, The Green and The Stage are capable of holding events for up to 6500 people. In front of The Studios there is a free-standing big screen, which is viewable from the piazza.|$|E

EPA realized that these brownfields-related jobs were being filled by environmental professionals from other cities, {{due to a lack of}} environmental training among local workforces. ...|$|R

This study examines how <b>brownfields</b> developers and community support organisations operating in socio-economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods work to increase awareness of projects in the community, build trust between stakeholders and create mechanisms for community members to participate in <b>brownfields</b> decision making. Analysis of case study data from <b>brownfields</b> sites in four US cities shows that developers and non-governmental organisations can play important roles in fashioning redevelopment outcomes which benefit both developers and communities. When standard required outreach efforts are combined with non-traditional community involvement mechanisms, the result is often long-term support for redevelopment projects. <b>brownfields,</b> public participation, environmental justice, stakeholders, VCP,...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the first}} part of our three-part study on the {{development}} of <b>brownfields</b> policy in Wisconsin, we examine the regulatory history of the <b>brownfields</b> policy. We start with the 1978 Hazardous Substance Spill Law, the antecedent to the <b>brownfields</b> regulatory reform of the 1990 s, and examine the interaction of policy entrepreneurs in both the public and the private sectors that has led to innovation. We follow this by exploring the response of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to reform efforts, looking at both how it anticipated and led some of the efforts and how it addressed demands placed on it by the state legislature and executive. We then discuss the central role that the state’s <b>Brownfields</b> Study Group has played in moving <b>brownfields</b> cleanup and redevelopment objectives into legislation and the field. We base our work on interviews with nearly 70 individuals from public, private for-profit, private nonprofit, and tribal organizations. <b>brownfields,</b> policy innovation, regulatory history...|$|R

40|$|The {{redevelopment}} of <b>Brownfields</b> {{has taken}} off in the 1990 s, supported by federal and state incentives, and largely accomplished by local initiatives. <b>Brownfields</b> redevelopment has several associated benefits. These include the revitalization of inner-city neighborhoods, creation of jobs, stimulation of tax revenues, greater protection {{of public health and}} natural resources, the renewal and reuse existing civil infrastructure and Greenfields protection. While these benefits are numerous, the obstacles to <b>Brownfields</b> redevelopment are also very much alive. Redevelopment issues typically embrace a host of financial and legal liability concerns, technical and economic constraints, competing objectives, and uncertainties arising from inadequate site information. Because the resources for <b>Brownfields</b> redevelopment are usually limited, local programs will require creativity in addressing these existing obstacles in a manner that extends their limited resources for returning <b>Brownfields</b> to productive uses. Such programs may benefit from a structured and defensible decision framework to prioritize sites for redevelopment: one that incorporates the desired objectives, corresponding variables and uncertainties associated with <b>Brownfields</b> redevelopment. This thesis demonstrates the use of a decision analytic tool, Bayesian Influence Diagrams, and related decision analytic tools in developing quantitative decision models to evaluate and rank <b>Brownfields</b> sites {{on the basis of their}} redevelopment potential...|$|R
