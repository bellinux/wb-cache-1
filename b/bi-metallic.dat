25|$|Water {{and steam}} based central heating systems have {{traditionally}} had overall control by wall-mounted <b>bi-metallic</b> strip thermostats. These sense the air temperature using the differential expansion of two metals to actuate an on/off switch. Typically the central {{system would be}} switched on when the temperature drops below the set point on the thermostat, and switched off when it rises above, with a few degrees of hysteresis to prevent excessive switching. <b>Bi-metallic</b> sensing is now being superseded by electronic sensors. A principal use of the <b>bi-metallic</b> thermostat today is in individual electric convection heaters, where control is on/off, based on the local air temperature and the set point desired by the user. These are also used on air-conditioners, where local control is required.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the Bank of the Republic of Colombia {{issued a}} new series of coins with the 500 and 1000 peso coins now struck as <b>Bi-metallic</b> coins.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, a <b>bi-metallic</b> 20-rupee coin {{was issued}} {{to commemorate the}} 40th anniversary of the Bank of Mauritius, and this {{has now become a}} coin in general circulation.|$|E
25|$|In 1847 Ward {{published}} Remarks on the Monetary Legislation of Great Britain (London), {{in which}} he condemned the act of 1816 establishing an exclusive gold standard, {{and called for a}} <b>bi-metallic</b> currency.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, {{aluminium-bronze}} 200-lira coins were introduced, {{followed in}} 1982 by the bimetallic 500 lire. This {{was the first}} <b>bi-metallic</b> coin to be produced for circulation, minted using a system patented by IPZS. It {{was also the first}} to feature the value in braille.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, a {{new series}} of coins was {{introduced}} consisting of , , 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 dinars. A 200 dinar <b>bi-metallic</b> coin was issued in 2012 to commemorate Algeria's 50th anniversary of independence. The 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 dinar coins are bimetallic.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1960s, four-pin thermal {{starters}} and manual switches were used. A mechanism then {{widely used}} for preheating, still in common use, is a glow switch starter (illustrated). It {{consists of a}} normally open <b>bi-metallic</b> switch in a small sealed gas-discharge lamp containing inert gas (neon or argon).|$|E
25|$|The coin was {{introduced}} on 15 June 1998 (coins minted 1997) after {{a review of}} the United Kingdom's coinage decided that a general-circulation £2 coin was needed. The new <b>Bi-metallic</b> coin design replaced a series of commemorative, uni-metallic coins which were issued between 1986 and 1996 to celebrate special occasions. Although legal tender, these coins have never been common in everyday circulation.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{thermostat}} control {{was developed in}} the 1830s by Andrew Ure (1778–1857), a Scottish chemist, who invented the <b>bi-metallic</b> thermostat. The textile mills of the time needed a constant and steady temperature to operate optimally, so to achieve this Ure designed the bimetallic thermostat, which would bend as one of the metals expanded in response to the increased temperature and cut off the energy supply.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} uses {{a combination}} filament–cathode {{at each end}} of the lamp in conjunction with a mechanical or automatic (<b>bi-metallic)</b> switch (see circuit diagram to the right) that initially connect the filaments in series with the ballast to preheat them; when the arc is struck the filaments are disconnected. This system is described as preheat in some countries and switchstart in others. These systems are standard equipment in 200–240V countries (and for 100–120V lamps up to about 30watts).|$|E
25|$|This was {{the first}} <b>bi-metallic</b> coin to be {{produced}} for circulation in Britain since the tin farthing with a copper plug produced in 1692, and is the highest denomination coin in common circulation in the UK. The coin consists of an outer yellow metal nickel-brass ring made from 76% copper, 20% zinc, and 4% nickel, and an inner steel-coloured cupro-nickel disc made from 75% copper, 25% nickel. The coin weighs 12 grams and is 28.4 millimetres in diameter.|$|E
25|$|When {{power is}} first {{applied to the}} circuit, {{there will be a}} glow {{discharge}} across the electrodes in the starter lamp. This heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the <b>bi-metallic</b> contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by thermionic emission. In the starter, the touching contacts short out the voltage sustaining the glow discharge, extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the <b>bi-metallic</b> switch, which opens within a second or two. The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an inductive kick which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect). A power factor correction (PFC) capacitor draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit.|$|E
25|$|Slovakia {{has offered}} to mint the coins, and has {{provided}} prototypes. The coins of up to 5 kopeks are struck in copper-plated steel; the 10, 20, 50 kopeks coins are struck in brass-plated steel; the 1 ruble coin in a nickel-plated steel composition and 2 rubles coin in a <b>bi-metallic</b> format (with a brass-plated steel ring and a nickel-plated steel center plug). All coins show the National emblem of Belarus, the inscription 'БЕЛАРУСЬ' (Belarus) and the year of minting on their obverse. The reverse shows {{the value of the}} coin accompanied by different ornaments with their own meanings.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1997, the two pound coin was minted in {{commemorative}} issues only – in 1986, 1989, 1994, 1995 and 1996. Commemorative £2 coins {{have been}} regularly issued since 1999, alongside the standard-issue <b>bi-metallic</b> coins which {{were introduced in}} 1997. One or two designs have been minted each year, {{with the exception of}} none in 2000, and four regional 2002 issues marking the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. As well as a distinct reverse design, these coins have an edge inscription relevant to the subject. The anniversary themes are continued until at least 2009, with two designs announced. For a complete list, see Two pounds (British decimal coin).|$|E
500|$|At the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the FIA {{banned the}} use of [...] "trick brake" [...] devices, which used a <b>bi-metallic</b> strip that changed shape when heated by the brakes to open or close off braking ducts and {{improving}} braking efficiency under certain conditions. This was deemed to be in breach of Article 11.4 of the Sporting Regulations, which states that the only permissible changes to the braking system while a car is moving must be directly controlled by the driver.|$|E
500|$|The Gold Rush stimulated economies {{around the}} world as well. Farmers in Chile, Australia, and Hawaii found a huge new market for their food; British {{manufactured}} goods were in high demand; clothing and even prefabricated houses arrived from China. The return of large amounts of California gold to pay for these goods raised prices and stimulated investment and the creation of jobs {{around the world}}. Australian prospector Edward Hargraves, noting similarities between the geography of California and his home country, returned to Australia to discover gold and spark the Australian gold rushes. [...] Preceding the Gold Rush, the United States was on a <b>bi-metallic</b> standard, but the sudden increase in physical gold supply increased the relative value of physical silver and drove silver money from circulation. [...] The increase in gold supply also created a monetary supply shock.|$|E
500|$|Congress {{passed the}} Coinage Act of 1853 in February of that year. The act lowered the silver {{weight of the}} coins ranging from the half dime to half dollar by 6.9%, though the dollar {{remained}} unaffected. The 1853 act eliminated the practice of depositing silver bullion to be struck into coin, except into the dollar for which a coining charge of [...]5% was imposed. [...] According to the Senate report filed with the bill which became the Coinage Act, these changes were intended as a temporary expedient, with the free coinage of silver to be restored when bullion prices became stable. Sources vary in their explanation as to why Congress chose to exempt the dollar from the silver coinage overhaul: numismatic historian R.W. Julian suggests that it was done due to its status as the [...] "flagship" [...] of American coins. [...] According to Don Taxay in his history of the Mint and coinage, [...] "the silver dollar, which it [...] left unchanged to preserve a <b>bi-metallic</b> currency, continued to be exported and was rarely used in commerce. [...] Without realizing it, the country had entered onto the gold standard." [...] Julian agreed, noting that the act instituted a de facto gold standard in the United States, because it required silver coinage {{to be paid for}} in gold. [...] The silver dollar continued to circulate little; quantities were sent west beginning in 1854 to serve as [...] "small change" [...] in California. [...] Silver prices remained high into the 1860s, and little silver bullion was presented for striking into dollars. [...] To serve collectors, individual specimens were made available to the public by the Mint at a cost of $1.08.|$|E
2500|$|Domestic {{water and}} steam based central heating systems have {{traditionally}} been controlled by <b>bi-metallic</b> strip thermostats, and this is dealt with later in this article. Purely mechanical control has been localised steam or hot-water radiator <b>bi-metallic</b> thermostats which [...] the individual flow. However, Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRV) are now being widely used.|$|E
2500|$|... †This coin was {{originally}} issued {{in a smaller}} size in a single metal in 1986 for special issues only. [...] It was redesigned as a <b>bi-metallic</b> issue for general circulation in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|... 10-baht coins {{are very}} similar to 2–euro coins in size, shape and weight, and are {{likewise}} <b>bi-metallic,</b> although they are worth only 25 eurocents. Vending machines not equipped with up-to-date coin detectors might therefore accept them as €2 coins.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "toonie", nicknamed {{after its}} one-dollar counterpart, {{features}} a <b>bi-metallic</b> locking mechanism, which was engineered and patented by the Royal Canadian Mint. The coin’s outer ring is nickel while the inner core is aluminum bronze (92% copper, 6% aluminum, 2% nickel). In 1996 alone, 375 million toonies were struck.|$|E
2500|$|The final [...] "round coins" [...] were minted in December 2015; the replacement, a new 12-sided design, was {{introduced}} in 2017. The coin has a 12-edged shape, similar to the pre-decimal brass threepence coin; it has roughly {{the same size as}} the previous £1 coin, and is <b>bi-metallic</b> like the current £2 coin. The new design is intended to make counterfeiting more difficult, and also has an undisclosed hidden security feature called [...] "iSIS" [...] (Integrated Secure Identification Systems).|$|E
2500|$|Arnold {{made another}} {{watch for the}} King around 1768, which was a gold and enamel pair cased watch with a {{movement}} that had every refinement, including minute repetition and centre seconds motion. In addition, Arnold fitted <b>bi-metallic</b> temperature compensation, and not only was every pivot hole jewelled but the escapement also had a stone cylinder made of ruby or sapphire. Arnold designated this watch [...] "Number 1", {{as he did with}} all watches he made that he regarded as significant, these numbering twenty in all.|$|E
2500|$|This {{technique}} uses {{a combination}} filament–cathode {{at each end}} of the lamp in conjunction with a mechanical or automatic (<b>bi-metallic</b> or electronic) switch that initially connect the filaments in series with the ballast to preheat them. When filaments are disconnected, an inductive pulse from the ballast starts the lamp. This system is described as [...] "Preheat" [...] in North America and [...] "Switch Start" [...] in the UK, and have no specific name in the rest part of the world. This systems is common in 200–240 V countries (and for 100–120 V lamps up to about 30 watts).|$|E
2500|$|The {{major change}} to Canadian coinage in the 1980s was the {{introduction}} of a circulating $1 coin, widely known as the loonie because of the common loon gracing its reverse. [...] A voyageur canoe had been planned initially, but the master reverse die was lost in shipment between Ottawa and Winnipeg, so a new design was necessary. [...] This coin was introduced in 1987, replacing the $1 banknote completely beginning in February 1989. In 1996, a $2 circulating coin (known widely as the toonie) was introduced, featuring a polar bear on the reverse, and the $2 banknote was withdrawn. The $2 coin was also a first for the mint in that it used a <b>bi-metallic</b> structure– the centre of the coin is bronze-coloured and the circumference is nickel-coloured.|$|E
2500|$|The design {{itself was}} first tried out in 1994 when the Royal Mint {{produced}} a short run of demonstration {{pieces to the}} new bi-metal standard. These pieces were not for circulation and were simply intended to test the manufacturing process. The coin was technically similar to the version which eventually entered circulation with the Maklouf effigy of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse {{and the image of}} a sailing ship similar to that previously used on the reverse of the pre-decimal halfpenny piece. The inscription on the reverse read ROYAL MINT TRIAL 1994 with an edge inscription based on the one pound coin which read DECUS ET TUTAMEN ANNO REGNI XLVI, meaning [...] "An ornament and a safeguard – in the 46th year of her reign". The 1994 pieces were never legal tender but were eventually released for sale as part of a presentation set in 1998. At the same time in 1994 the Royal Mint produced a mono-metallic trial two-pound coin, with the same ship reverse and inscription, but otherwise similar to the earlier commemorative coins. These were never issued in presentation sets, and so are much scarcer than the <b>bi-metallic</b> version.|$|E
5000|$|In recent times, {{the first}} {{circulating}} <b>bi-metallic</b> coin was the Italian 500 lire, first issued in 1982. Morocco, with a 5 dirhams coin in 1987; France, with a 10 franc coin in 1992; Monaco, with a 10 franc; Thailand, with a 10 baht, in 1988; and Hong Kong, with a $10 coin, in 1993; Hungary, with a 100 forint coin in 1996, issued <b>bi-metallic</b> coins for circulation {{all based on}} the Italian 500 lire's minting process. India introduced 10 rupee <b>bi-metallic</b> coins in 2009 that are dated 2006 (minted at Noida). Since 1996, Canada has also produced <b>bi-metallic</b> $2 coins (nicknamed [...] "Toonies"), Great Britain has issued a <b>bi-metallic</b> 2 pounds coin since 1997 and Singapore has issued a <b>bi-metallic</b> 1 dollar coin since 2013.|$|E
