5|$|Joe Kinnear took Luton <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the first}} time of asking, but was sacked by the club's new owners {{following}} a takeover in May 2003. Mike Newell was appointed as manager, and his side became League One champions in 2004–05. Internal troubles at the club started to intensify {{during the summer of}} 2006, as the club's chairman was revealed by Newell to be making illegal payments to agents—after writing a scathing letter to the board, Newell was sacked in March 2007. Kevin Blackwell was appointed in his stead, but was also sacked {{less than a year later}} on 16 January 2008; former player Mick Harford was made Luton Town's new manager the same day, and he was unable to prevent the club's relegation in 2007–08. After being deducted a total of 30 points by The Football League and The Football Association for 2008–09, Luton were relegated to the Conference Premier; however, the club claimed a Football League Trophy victory during the same season. After two months of the 2009–10 season, Harford left the club by mutual consent, to be replaced a month later by Richard Money. Money's assistant, Gary Brabin, replaced him in March 2011, and managed the club until he was sacked a year later. His replacement, Paul Buckle, took charge in April 2012, and was himself replaced in February 2013 by John Still. Still took Luton back into The Football League in his first full season as manager, breaking a number of club records in the process. Still guided Luton to a comfortable finish in their first season back in League Two, but was sacked by the club in December 2015 following a poor run of form. He was replaced by Nathan Jones in January 2016, who took on his first ever managerial role.|$|E
25|$|Alpha mounted <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 10:50am {{to drive}} back {{into town and}} try to assist Bravo Company. This request {{had come from the}} Ops Room and had been worded {{carefully}} so as not to sound like an order; only the commander on the ground could assess whether or not Alpha could be of any use. As they expected, they came under contact with heavy fire almost immediately and they had to de-bus from the DAF truck. An RPG was fired at the truck, but was deflected {{just in front of the}} vehicle by an electricity cable.|$|E
25|$|Midway {{through the}} third quarter, Allen lost a fumble {{that led to}} Franklin's field goal, tying the game <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 20. Then in {{what turned out to}} be the key play of the game, Raiders cornerback Sam Seale fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Bowman {{recovered}} in the end zone for a touchdown to give his team a 27–20 lead. There was still a full quarter left to play, but the Raiders would get no further in the game than the New England 41-yard line. Los Angeles' three fourth quarter drives would result in a punt, an interception by Fred Marion and a turnover on downs at their own 13.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the third}} quarter, the Bills {{advanced}} 69 yards in five plays, starting with Ferguson's 15-yard pass to Frank Lewis and ending with a 44-yard touchdown run by Cribbs to tie the game. Cincinnati's David Verser returned the ensuing kickoff 40 yards to their 35-yard line, and the team responded with a 7-play 65-yard drive, including a 13-yard scramble by Anderson, to retake the lead with a 20-yard touchdown run by Alexander. Buffalo struck right back with a 79-yard scoring drive. Cribbs was injured and knocked {{out of the game}} on the first play, but his replacement Roland Hooks rushed five times for 24 yards and caught a pass for 6, while Ferguson finished the drive with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Butler, tying the game <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 21 on the first play of the fourth quarter.|$|E
25|$|Joe Kinnear set out {{his plan}} for Luton – they were to go <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the first attempt. He oversaw a {{complete}} overhaul of the squad during the summer, building {{a team that was}} Luton's finest for some years. Midfielder Kevin Nicholls signed from Wigan Athletic for £25,000 and would go on to become a key figure in midfield, earning the club captaincy; a role he would hold for the next five years. Australian defender Chris Coyne signed from Dundee, again for a small fee of £50,000. Steve Howard ended the season by winning the Third Division golden boot award with 24 goals. Ending the season with a club-record 12 consecutive wins, Luton travelled to Swansea City at the end of March knowing that a win would guarantee them promotion back to the third tier at the first attempt. They duly won 3–1.|$|E
25|$|Millwall's spell {{in the top}} {{flight was}} not to last as they were relegated in the {{following}} season, finishing bottom of the Division after briefly topping the table again early in the season. Sheringham was again top scorer for Millwall with twelve goals, having missed ten league games through injury. The club {{had an opportunity to}} bounce straight <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the end of the 1990–91 season, reaching the semi-finals of the Division Two play-offs, but they were beaten by Brighton & Hove Albion and remained in the Second Division. Sheringham's outstanding form during the 1990–91 season saw him finish as the league's highest scorer with 37 goals, a haul which included four hat-tricks. With Millwall failing to return to the top flight, a departure for Sheringham looked inevitable. In his final season at Millwall, Sheringham broke all of the club's goalscoring records, scoring a total of 111 goals in all competitions in his eight years at the club. He was Millwall's all-time leading scorer until 2009.|$|E

500|$|Unlike 9413, other extras {{around him}} begin to find success. A woman (Adriane Marsh) {{with the number}} [...] "13" [...] on her head {{constantly}} kneels and stands <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the behest of a film director, and eventually succeeds in landing a part, greeted by a [...] "Casting Today" [...] sign. Another extra (Voya George) with the number [...] "15", who unlike 9413 has expressionless and unenthusiastic facial expressions, holds paper masks {{in front of his}} face, symbolizing his performances. He is greeted with enthusiasm by the cheering masses, all of whom speak in the same gibberish as 9413. His number 15 is replaced with a star and he achieves tremendous success. 9413 admires this new movie star and attempts to mimic him, presenting his own, much more impressive-looking mask. But the star is unimpressed and disregards 9413, who sadly cradles his mask like a baby, lamenting his inability to achieve success.|$|E
2500|$|Fry {{struggled}} to keep his homosexuality secret during his teenage years at public school, and by his own account did not engage in sexual activity for 16 years from 1979 until 1995. When asked when he first acknowledged his sexuality, Fry quipped: [...] "I suppose it all began when I {{came out of the}} womb. I looked <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> my mother and thought to myself, 'That's the last time I'm going up one of those'." [...] Fry was in a 15-year relationship with Daniel Cohen, which ended in 2010. In 2016, Fry was listed number 2 on the World Pride Power list.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the second}} verse, Eminem {{appears in a}} {{recording}} studio, rapping his verse in [...] "No Love." [...] American hip hop producers Just Blaze, The Alchemist and Denaun Porter make cameo appearances in the studio. When the boy arrives home from school, his parents see his injuries and begin arguing. The boy leaves to go skateboarding. After listening to Eminem and Lil Wayne, he is motivated and soon has the urge {{to stand up to}} the bullies. He arrives wearing a hoodie. At first the boy gets knocked down, but gets <b>back</b> <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> this moment, Eminem finishes his verse and starts singing the chorus. The scenario appears to play out in several ways where in one scene the boy appears to strike one of the bullies and then runs, only to be caught by them. In the next scene, he appears to be on top of one of the bullies and strikes him yet near the end it only appears he postures against the bullies and then walks away. Eminem also finishes his session and leaves to end the video.|$|E

2500|$|The LADWP, {{along with}} raw water {{deliveries}} and lake level management from the California Department of Water Resources, also operates the Castaic Power Plant as a pumped storage facility.

[...] About 1,600 megawatts, or 22% of the total capacity, is generated at this facility alone. The Los Angeles City Council voted in 2004 to direct the LADWP to generate 20% of its energy (excluding Hoover Dam) from clean sources by 2010, a goal which was met. The LADWP expects to achieve 25 percent renewables by 2016 and 33 percent by 2020. [...] As of 2014, [...] "green power" [...] sources account for 20% of the LADWP's capacity, including the 120 MW Pine Tree Wind Farm, the largest municipally-owned wind farm in the United States.

2500|$|While {{the first}} game of the series was a pitchers' duel, Game 2 was the exact opposite. The scoring opened up quickly, as the Red Sox put on a 2-out rally against Rays starter Scott Kazmir in the 1st inning from a Jason Bay double that scored Kevin Youkilis and David Ortiz to put the Red Sox up 2–0. The Rays {{answered}} in their half of the 1st inning off Red Sox starter Josh Beckett, with a 2-out home run by Evan Longoria which also brought in Carlos Peña, evening the game at 2–2. Dustin Pedroia hit a solo home run to Left Field in the 3rd inning, which was again answered by the Rays with B.J. Upton hitting a solo home run of his own to Left Field to tie the game <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 3–3. Carl Crawford would hit a single to score Evan Longoria, and the Rays took their first lead of the night at 4–3. Cliff Floyd went deep to Center Field in the 4th inning to give the Rays a 5–3 lead. The Red Sox would hit three solo home runs in the 5th inning, including Dustin Pedroia for his second long ball of the night, Kevin Youkilis, and Jason Bay, respectively, putting the Red Sox back on top at 6–5. [...] The Rays would also score three separate times in the 5th inning, off of a single from Carlos Peña, a double by Evan Longoria, and a single by Carl Crawford, retaking the lead at 8–6. The Red Sox would not go away quietly as Jason Bay hit a bases-loaded single to Center Field and cut the Rays' lead to 8–7. With Dan Wheeler in to pitch for the Rays in the 8th, a wild pitch would score Dustin Pedroia from 3rd base to again tie the game at 8–8. The game would need extra innings, where in the 11th inning, and Dan Wheeler still pitching for the Rays, walked a batter with one out, and rookie David Price came in for the Rays. Price would walk the first batter he faced but stuck out Mark Kotsay, and was able to get Coco Crisp to ground into a force out at 2nd base. For the Rays in the 11th inning, Dioner Navarro walked to lead off, and Fernando Perez came in to pinch run. Ben Zobrist then walked, and a ground out by Jason Bartlett advanced the runners. The Red Sox would intentionally walk Akinori Iwamura to set up a double play chance, but B.J. Upton would hit a fly ball to Right Field deep enough to score Fernando Perez from 3rd base on a sacrifice fly, ending the game in the Rays' favor 9–8, knotting the series at one game each as the series shifted to Fenway Park for the next three games. The time that the game took to complete was 5 hours and 27 minutes.|$|E
