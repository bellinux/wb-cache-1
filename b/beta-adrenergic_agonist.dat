40|$|Abstract: Catecholamines are {{produced}} by chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla and adrenergic and dopaminergic neurons from tyrosine. Catecholamines regulate many vital physiological and metabolic responses because of the location of receptors. The impact of catecholamines {{is not limited to}} mammals; direct effects of natural catecholamines on bacteria have been researched extensively to understand the potential impact of these compounds on bacterial infections in humans. Catecholamines have increased the growth of bacteria, virulence-associated factors, and adhesins and increased biofilm formation. <b>Beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonists</b> are similar in structure and pharmacological properties to natural catecholamines. <b>Beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonists</b> enhance performance of finishing cattle during the final days prior to harvest. Responses to <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonists</b> include increased average daily gain, improved feed efficiency, and increased carcass lean. These responses have been observed as a direct effect to the animal; however, {{a review of the literature}} suggests that the response to <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonists</b> also could be mediated by a direct or indirect effect on ruminal microorganisms. Ractopamine hydrochloride increased fermentation in vitro, particularly with increased amounts of degradable intake protein. Inclusion of ractopamine hydrochloride in vivo decreased ruminal concentrations of ammonia and amino acid. The rumen is host to a large population of diverse microorganisms, and a direct impact of a synthetic catecholamine on the microbial population could potentially alter fermentation and the ruminant performance. Reviewing literature on catecholamines and their direct impact on microorganisms could lead to improved decisions regarding dietary supplementation of <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonists,</b> threreby increasing the growth performance response in ruminants...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonists</b> on ATP {{utilization}} and adenine nucleotide breakdown in human adipocytes were examined. The catecholamine-induced increase in cAMP {{was associated with}} an enhancement of adenine nucleotide catabolism resulting {{in an increase in}} release of inosine and hypoxanthine which can not be reutilized for adenine nucleotide synthesis. Therefore, one-third of total cellular adenine nucleotides were irreversibly lost in the presence of 1 mumol/liter isoproterenol. The catecholamine-induced increase in purine release could be blocked by phosphodiesterase inhibitors, suggesting that cAMP is the main precursor of purines in the presence of <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonists.</b> However, epinephrine (in the simultaneous presence of the alpha 2 -adrenergic blocking agent, yohimbine) and isoproterenol were 10 times more potent in stimulating purine release than in elevating cAMP. In addition, purine release ceased when cAMP was still markedly increased, suggesting a compartmentation of the cyclic nucleotide and/or involvement of the hormone-sensitive, low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase.

40|$|A {{procedure}} for the functional reconstitution of beta-adrenergic receptors and the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G/F) of adenylate cyclase in phospholipid vesicles is described. beta-Adrenergic receptors were solubilized from turkey erythrocyte plasma membranes and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles {{by the addition}} of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine and removal of detergent by gel filtration. This procedure restored the ability to bind [125 I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol and [3 H]dihydroalprenolol. Purified rabbit hepatic G/F that was added to the receptor vesicles could be stably activated by guanosine 5 '-[3 -thio]triphosphate at a low rate, and this activation was increased up to 4 -fold in the presence of <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonists.</b> This stimulation of the activation of G/F was specific for <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonists</b> and could be specifically blocked by beta-adrenergic antagonists.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{family of}} A-kinase-anchoring proteins, AKAPs, {{constitutes}} {{a group of}} molecular scaffolds that act to catalyze dynamic interactions of protein kinase A, protein kinase C, tyrosine kinases, G-protein-coupled receptors and ion channels. AKAP 5 (MW ~ 47 kDa) and AKAP 12 (MW ~ 191 kDa) homo-oligomerize, {{but whether or not}} such AKAPs can hetero-oligomerize into supermolecular scaffolds of increased complexity is unknown. Results Affinity chromatography using immobilized AKAPs as "bait" demonstrates unequivocally that AKAP 5 and AKAP 12 do form minimally hetero-dimers. Steric-exclusion chromatography of AKAP 5 and AKAP 12 mixtures revealed the existence of very large, supermolecular complexes containing both AKAPs. Docking of AKAP 5 to AKAP 12 was increased 4 -fold by <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonist</b> stimulation.

40|$|Continuous {{incubation}} of {{cultured cells}} with <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonists</b> {{results in the}} desensitization of adrenergic responsiveness accompanied by the down-regulation of cell surface beta-adrenergic receptors (beta AR). Previous studies have relied on measurements of ligand binding activity {{for the detection of}} the beta AR in the cell.

This antibody was used to localize the beta AR in hamster smooth-muscle DDT- 1 cells by immunofluorescence, without regard for the ability of the receptor to bind ligands. The beta AR was found to be localized primarily at the plasma membrane of these cells, with a nonhomogeneous pattern of distribution. A rapid loss of beta AR-specific immunofluorescence, which paralleled receptor down-regulation as measured by ligand-binding activity, was seen with <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonists,</b> but not with antagonists. In addition, a transient increase in fluorescence was observed after short times of exposure of the cells to agonists.

40|$|The beta-adrenergic {{stimulation}} of adenylate cyclase in membranes from human lung {{was compared to}} that of adenylate cyclase in membranes with a majority of beta 2 -adrenergic receptors (from rat lung) and in membranes with a homogeneous population of beta 2 -adrenergic receptors (from rat erythrocytes and reticulocytes). In terms of adenylate cyclase stimulation, three full agonists (isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine), four partial agonists (procaterol, salbutamol, fenoterol and zinterol), and four antagonists (propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol and practolol) were tested. The potency (Kact or Ki) of the eleven beta-adrenergic agents, and the Hill coefficient (of 1) for the four antagonists tested indicated that the activation of human lung adenylate cyclase occurred through receptors of the beta 2 -subtype only. Partial <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonists</b> were efficiently discriminated by the human lung preparation, as shown by distinct intrinsic activities. The mediocre efficacy and the relatively low potency of all <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonists</b> on adenylate cyclase suggested a relatively low density of beta 2 -adrenergic receptors, as compared to the enzyme density.

The stimulation was stereospecific, dose-dependent, and inhibited by the <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonist</b> propranolol. The addition of GTP inside the resealed ghosts shifted the dose-response of phospholipid methylation by L-isoproterenol {{to the left}} by 2 orders of magnitude. Direct stimulation of adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4. 6. 1. 1] with sodium fluoride or cholera toxin did not increase the methylation of phospholipids. At a concentration of S-adenosyl-L-methionine that stimulates synthesis of phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine, the activity of isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase was increased 2 -fold without changes in the basal activity of adenylate cyclase {{and the number of}} beta-adrenergic receptors. The increase of phospholipid methylation by L-isoproterenol decreased membrane viscosity and increased translocation of methylated lipids.

40|$|The adipose-derived hormone, adiponectin (ApN), {{has a role}} in fuel homoeostasis, insulin {{action and}} atherosclerosis. Regulation of ApN by catecholamines has {{scarcely}} been investigated. We {{examined the effects of}} <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>agonists</b> (and their second messenger, cAMP) on ApN gene expression, production and secretion in mouse in vitro and in vivo; their effects in human fat were also briefly studied in vitro. <b>beta-Adrenergic</b> <b>agonists</b> and cAMP inhibited ApN gene expression in human visceral adipose tissue. Likewise, cAMP down-regulated ApN mRNAs in cultured mouse explants from visceral and subcutaneous regions. The amount of ApN released into the medium decreased concomitantly. cAMP also caused qualitative changes in ApN secretion. Under basal conditions, ApN was secreted as a single 32 kDa species. In the presence of cAMP, an additional and probably immature (not modified post-translationally) 30 kDa species was also sorted. This altered secretion resulted from cAMP-induced quantitative and qualitative changes of ApN within the adipocyte. Under basal conditions, the 32 kDa form of ApN was mainly associated with high-density microsomes (HDMs), while the 30 kDa species was confined to a pool recovered with the cytosol fraction. cAMP depleted intracellular ApN at the expense of both HDM and cytosol fractions, and abnormally targeted ApN species to the different subcellular compartments as a result of impaired maturation. <b>beta-Adrenergic</b> <b>agonists</b> mimicked the inhibitory effects of cAMP on ApN mRNA and secretion, the beta(3) -agonist BRL 37344 being the most potent. Administration of BRL 37344 to mice reduced ApN mRNAs in both adipose regions, and ApN levels in plasma. In conclusion, beta-agonists inhibited ApN production and maturation, and thus exerted a dual (pre- and post-translational) negative effect on ApN secretion by cultured mouse adipose explants. ApN inhibition by beta-agonists was reproduced in mouse in vivo and in humans in vitro. ApN down-regulation may have an important role in fuel homoeostasis, insulin resistance and stress-induced atherosclerosis...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} antiasthma drugs on asthmatic reactions and airway inflammation, we studied several groups of sensitized subjects treated with active drugs or placebo before and after exposure to toluene diisocyanate in the laboratory. We observed that the steroidal anti-inflammatory agent prednisone, but not the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent indomethacin, inhibits the late (but not the early) asthmatic reactions induced by TDI. Prednisone also inhibits the increase of bronchial responsiveness and the increase of neutrophils, eosinophils, and albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid that are associated with late asthmatic reactions induced by exposure to TDI. Beclomethasone has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on TDI-induced late asthmatic reactions, whereas theophylline has a partial inhibitory effect on both early and late asthmatic reactions, and verapamil, ketotifen, cromolyn. Beta 2 -adrenergic agonists have variable effects: salbutamol has no effect on early and late asthmatic reactions by itself, but it potentiates the inhibitory effect of low doses of beclomethasone.
