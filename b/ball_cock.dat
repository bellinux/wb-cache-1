[...] It was made of the highest grade metal with hardware bronze seat and was the only <b>ball</b> <b>cock</b> produced with adjustable refill tube and was designed to [...] "work equally well on high or low pressures." ...|$|E
50|$|T-Stoff: High test {{peroxide}} equipment {{consists of}} a pipe which runs along the starboard beam of the lifting frame from the trunnion end to the halfway point. The pipe is fitted at the upper end to the triple valve assembly, consisting of two flow valves and a three-way valve. The triple valve assembly connects to two tanks, a large measuring tank and a smaller overflow tank. The measuring tank can be filled to the rocket's required amount of T-stoff, after which any excess flows down a stand pipe to the overflow tank. The measuring tank is fitted with a ventilation stud, which vents displaced air as the tank is filled. The ventilation stud includes a <b>ball</b> <b>cock</b> fixed to a frustum stopper, which blocks the vent stud in case of accidental overfilling so that T-Stoff does not spray from the air vent. Both T-Stoff tanks are fitted with an inspection window.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is the {{seawater}} distillation process enhancement through integration of the solar vacuum tube into the system. Positive effects on the rate of distillated freshwater achieved by means of the enhanced system have been investigated experimentally. Experiments were done in the Turkish city of Samsun in the Black Sea region. A distillation pond setup having the volume of 0. 015 m 3 and a water surface area of 0. 24 m 2 was constructed. The distillation pond is covered with a condensation glass and also equipped with a 0. 15 m solar vacuum tube that is inclined at an angle of 30 o to the ground, a feed water tank connected with a <b>ball</b> <b>cock,</b> and distillated fresh water tank. Experimental results have shown that the rate of distilled fresh water was enhanced for about 62. 5 % by integrating the solar vacuum tube and the natural distillation pond. Isolation of the condensation glass not only prevents the light transmission to the pond but also heat loss from the pond; hence the rate of the distillated fresh water is increased for about 137. 5 % due to the natural distillation...|$|E

40|$|There the {{purposes}} are {{to develop the}} diamond honing process of unclosed spheric surfaces of plugs of <b>ball</b> <b>cocks</b> (by example of Du 15 Ru 160 cock), to increase the accuracy {{and the quality of}} surface of contacting pairs. The experiments were executed by the semicommercial plant. The theoretical and practical results are the development of mathematical simulator of kinematics of diamond honing process by the floating tool with the isolated grain, with the group of grains, which were placed in order and casually, the theoretical and experimental substantiation of correcting ability of process, the development of equipping process, the development of recommendations to choose the working modes. The diamond honing process has been accepted for use by the Joint-Stock Company "Tyazhpromarmatura" (Alexin) Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{oriented}} carboplastics {{and methods}} of their tribotechnical investigations have been considered in the paper. The aim {{is to increase the}} wear-resistance of materials for piston seals by a means of the composition optimization, selection of composition structure, components and their relation and also development of the effective lubricants possessing a metal-cladding action. The tribotechnical and experimental-production tests have been performed. The influence of orientation filler on the antifrictional, thermophysical, thermofrictional properties of carboplastic has been established. The composition of antifrictional material Htibolon-B has been optimized, the metal-cladding compositions to the lubricants have been developed. The carbofiber Htibolon-B and metal-cladding compositions to lubricants have been introduced. The economic effect is 27500 roubles.

40|$|The {{problem in}} this {{research}} is still lack of strength of arm and shoulder muscles when making a stroke, as a result a <b>ball</b> (<b>cock)</b> can not pass through the net in the Junior male athlete of PB club Tualang, Siak. Based on these problems, the researcher provided the exercise of Dumbell Raise Forward for 18 x meeting. The research aims {{to determine whether there}} is influence between Forward Raise Dumbell exercises through the strength of arm and shoulder muscle of athletes PB club Junior Tualang Siak, hence when making a strike, it might get the maximum result. The model of this research is the treatment trial (Experiment Research), with a population of it was PB club Junior athletes Tualang Siak, the data in this study was the entire population of 6 people. The instruments used in this research was Expanding Dynamometer test that aimed to measure the strength of the arm and shoulder muscles. After that, it was analyzed by the statistic data, to test for normality with lilifors test at significant level Î± (0. 05). The hypothesis proposed there was the effect of exercise Dumbell Raise Forward to the strength of the arm and shoulder muscles. Based on the analysis of statistic data, there was an average of the pre-test which was 16. 3 and the average post-test for T 20, 5, then the data was normal with an increase of 4. 2. Based on T test analysis produced Tcount 13, 45 and Ttable 1, 943, it means Tcount > Ttabel. In conclusion, there is effect of Forward Raise Dumbell Exercise on the arm and shoulder muscle strength at athletes of PB Junior Male Club Tualang, Siak Regency...|$|E
50|$|It was {{a preoccupation}} of the Greeks and Arabs (in {{the period between}} about 300 BC and about 1200 AD) to keep {{accurate}} track of time. In Ptolemaic Egypt, about 270 BC, Ctesibius described a float regulator for a water clock, a device not unlike the <b>ball</b> and <b>cock</b> in a modern flush toilet. The appearance of the mechanical clock in the 14th century made the water clock and its feedback control system obsolete.|$|R
5000|$|In comedy, a dick joke, penis joke, <b>balls</b> joke, <b>cock</b> joke or a knob joke is a {{joke that}} makes a direct or {{indirect}} reference to a human penis (known in slang parlance as a dick), also used as an umbrella term for dirty jokes. The famous quote from Mae West, [...] "Is that a gun in your pocket {{or are you just}} excited to see me?" [...] is cited {{as an example of a}} penis joke.

5000|$|Pace bowlers {{frequently}} dismiss batsmen through {{variation and}} deception. A batter {{who has been}} [...] "softened up" [...] {{by a series of}} bouncers, which pitch nearer the bowler than normal and reach the batsman around head height, or even hit the batsman, may tend to play the next ball on the back foot, and thus be susceptible to a full length yorker delivery that bounces at his toes. Many bowlers also develop a [...] "slower ball"; these are bowled with the same arm action as their normal delivery, but come slower from the hand, usually due the bowler gripping the <b>ball</b> differently or <b>cocking</b> his wrist at the last moment. With luck, the batsman will misread the pace, and will have finished his shot before the ball arrives. Other common variations include the leg cutter and off cutter, medium pace deliveries bowled with a spinner's wrist action, which can sometimes [...] "turn" [...] just like deliveries from a spinner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! but {{you have}} no idea how clever they are at it, and the Totties are just as bad, if not worse. On one {{occasion}} we had a nest of eggs in the field over there, which we had left to be hatched in the natural way by the hen-ostrich. One night it rained very hard--so hard that we feared the young ones would be drowned in the nest, so brother Johnny was sent to look after them. He took two Totties with him. It was very dark, but he found the nest with the cock bird sitting on it. You know the cock always sits at night. Well, Johnny took him by the nose and pulled him off the nest, and gave him to the two Totties to hold. It was hard work, but they kept his head well down, so that he couldn't kick. Johnny soon bagged all the little ones, leaped over the wall, and then called out to let go the cock. It was so dark that he couldn't see very well. He could only hear a scuffle, and then saw the two men bounding over the wall like indiarubber <b>balls</b> while the <b>cock</b> went bang against it like a battering-ram. We got the little ones home all safe, but, would you believe it? these rascally Totties had managed to pull out all the best wing-feathers while they were holding the cock--each feather worth, perhaps, twenty shillings or more--and got clear away with them to the canteen, where they can always sell stolen goods.|$|R
