50|$|The National Lighthouse Centre was {{a museum}} opened by Trinity House, an {{organisation}} {{with a history}} of building an maintaining lighthouses, in 1989. The museum building was converted from the Trinity House <b>buoy</b> <b>store,</b> part of the Penzance Depot, where buoys were stored and repaired. It featured an interactive experience of lighthouse keepers, as well has housing Trinity House's collection of lighthouse equipment. It also featured a recreation of a lighthouse keeper's bed room where visitors were able to touch the exhibits, a collection of optics, lighthouse keepers' uniforms and documentation The museum also traced the history of Trinity House, also featured a selection of buoys from the <b>buoy</b> <b>store.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1891, Congress {{appropriated}} $35,000 for {{the construction}} of a supply depot at St. Joseph's harbor. Plans for the depot were prepared by the ninth district engineer, Major William Ludlow of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Construction of the depot began in 1891, and work was eventually completed in early 1893 on the storehouse, keeper's house, and carpenter-lampist shop. A storehouse/shop building on the grounds was likely built in 1909/10. The depot was used for receiving, overhauling, and <b>storing</b> <b>buoys</b> and their appendages, and was charged with delivering supplies to the lighthouse keepers in the district.|$|R
50|$|Tuscana {{anchored}} at Garapan on 1 August, detached men {{and cargo}} {{for the operation}} of harbor and waterfront facilities, and on 7 August began net operations. Throughout {{the remainder of the}} month, Tuscanas crew labored to assemble and launch anti-torpedo nets which were towed into place and installed by the smaller net laying ships (ANs). On this, her first net laying assignment, Tuscana provided nets to protect Mutcho Point and Garapan harbor from submarine attack. After completing this vital task, Tuscana arrived at Pearl Harbor on 11 September and began loading <b>stores,</b> <b>buoys,</b> and net materials.|$|R

50|$|In 1853 the Royal National Lifeboat Institution {{stationed}} one {{of their}} boats in the town, the first since 1812, and maintained a station here until 1908 when the Watson Class Elizabeth Blanche was transferred to Newlyn {{as the first step}} towards setting up Penlee Lifeboat Station. The RNLI still use a boat house built on Jennings Street near the Promenade in 1884 to promote their activities. Penzance, with its dry dock and engineering facilities, was chosen as the western depot for Trinity House that serviced all the lighthouses and lightships from Start Point to Trevose Head. It was opened in October 1866 adjacent to the harbour and the <b>Buoy</b> <b>Store</b> became the Trinity House National Lighthouse Museum until 2005 when Trinity House closed the museum.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the environmental monitoring / regatta beacon buoy under {{development at the}} Laboratory of Autonomous Systems (LSA) of the Polytechnic Institute of Porto. On the one hand, environmentalmonitoring of open water bodies in real or deferred time is essential to assess and make sensible decisions and, on the other hand, the broadcast in real time of position, water and wind related parameters allows autonomous boats to optimise their regatta performance. This proposal, rather than restraining the boats autonomy, fosters the development of intelligent behaviour by allowing the boats to focus on regatta strategy and tactics. The Nautical and Telemetric Application (NAUTA) buoy is a dual mode reconfigurable system that includes communications, control, data logging, sensing, storage and power subsystems. In environmental monitoring mode, the <b>buoy</b> gathers and <b>stores</b> data from several underwater and above water sensors and, in regatta mode, the buoy becomes an active course mark for the autonomous sailing boats in the vicinity. During a race, the buoy broadcasts its position, together with {{the wind and the}} water current local conditions, allowing autonomous boats to navigate towards and round the mark successfully. This project started with the specification of the requirements of the dual mode operation, followed by the design and building of the buoy structure. The research is currently focussed {{on the development of the}} modular, reconfigurable, open source-based control system. The NAUTA buoy is innovative, extensible and optimises the on board platform resources...|$|R
40|$|The Porcupine Abyssal Plain Observatory is a sustained, {{multidisciplinary}} observatory in the North Atlantic {{coordinated by}} the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton. For over 20 years the observatory has provided key time-series datasets for analysing {{the effect of}} climate change on the open ocean and deep-sea ecosystems. As is normally the case during cruises which are needed to refurbish the observatory, {{a wide range of}} other activities were carried out during the cruise. The main mooring Ocean Data Acquisition System (ODAS) buoy had ceased transmitting data in March 2015, so a high priority was to recover the <b>buoy</b> and its <b>stored</b> data and this was successfully achieved. In addition, we recovered a set of sediment traps which had been collecting sinking material in {{the lower part of the}} water column for the previous 12 months and deployed a new set. These are the autonomous systems, but as is usually the case with our trips to PAP, we carried out various other activities and in this case we investigated the degradation of particles as they sink. Our colleagues from MIO in France carry out sophisticated interrogation using radiolabelling. The Bathysnap time-lapse camera system which had been taking photos of the seabed at 4800 m was recovered to give an assessment of the behaviour of the benthic animals and how the seabed appearance changes in response to deposition of material. A new module was deployed. Temporal variability of the water column and seabed fauna - a task which is difficult or impossible to do autonomously was assessed using nets and cores...|$|R
