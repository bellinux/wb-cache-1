25|$|As more {{information}} about the signal became available, its purpose as a radar signal became increasingly obvious. In particular, its signal contained a clearly recognizable structure in each pulse, which was eventually identified as a 31-bit pseudo-random <b>binary</b> <b>sequence,</b> with a bit-width of 100 μs resulting in a 3.1 ms pulse. This sequence is usable for a 100μs chirped pulse amplification system, giving a resolution of 15km (10mi) (the distance light travels in 50μs). When a second Woodpecker appeared, this one located in eastern Russia but also pointed toward the US and covering blank spots in the first system's pattern, this conclusion became inescapable.|$|E
