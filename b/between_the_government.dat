5|$|Although {{the scale}} of the phase 3 {{reclamation}} in Central was cut back from 32 to 18 hectares, the fate of the piers was sealed by the reclamation. The pier became the centre of a bitter struggle <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> and conservationists, who opposed either further destruction of the harbour or the further loss of historical buildings.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} years of the war, a degree of tension existed <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and the army, which divided its {{allegiance}} between government and King. The Free Belgian forces, particular the infantry who had been training since 1940, held the government responsible for not being allowed to fight. In November 1942, 12 Belgian soldiers mutinied, complaining about their inactivity. By 1943, the army's royalist stance had been moderated, allowing the government to re-gain the support of the military.|$|E

5|$|Hays' plan {{involved}} {{the creation of}} a subsidiary line from Winnipeg to Prince Rupert, with the government building the line from New Brunswick to Winnipeg. The cabinet became weary of Hays' demands for subsidies, but after negotiations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and Hays, aided by the railroad's president Rivers Wilson, the National Transcontinental Railway Act was passed in 1903. It enabled the incorporation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP). The government's portion of the line would be called the National Transcontinental Railway (NTR).|$|E
5|$|Lutosławski was at {{this time}} writing his Piano Concerto for Krystian Zimerman, {{commissioned}} by the Salzburg Festival. His earliest plans to write a piano concerto dated from 1938; he was himself in his younger days a virtuoso pianist. It was a performance of this work and the Third Symphony at the Warsaw Autumn Festival in 1988 that marked the composer's return to the conductor's podium in Poland, after substantive talks had been arranged <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and the opposition.|$|E
5|$|Outwardly, the {{destruction}} and removals for sale {{had changed the}} church forever. Many churches had concealed their vestments and their silver, and had buried their stone altars. There were many disputes <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and parishes over church property. Thus, when Edward died in July 1553 and the Duke of Northumberland attempted to have the Protestant Lady Jane Grey made Queen, the unpopularity of the confiscations gave Mary {{the opportunity to have}} herself proclaimed Queen, first in Suffolk, and then in London to the acclamation of the crowds.|$|E

5|$|Romano and Senior {{argue that}} Antara's {{relationship}} with the government puts the agency at risk of engaging in self-censorship in recent years. Internal reforms immediately after 1998 did not completely eliminate the culture of cronyism {{that had come to}} characterize the relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and the press. The two note, however, that Antara journalists were given greater rights to affiliate and organize into unions than their peers in other news organizations.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the railway introduced new tensions <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and the First Nations. The authorities wished to move the indigenous peoples to reservations north of the railway in order to cut them off from the United States border. For their part, the First Nations were unhappy about the railway being built through their lands, stole company horses and disrupted the construction work. The mounted police made arrests and the government reduced their rations: by 1883, the threat of starvation had forced the First Nations to relocate to the northern side of the line.|$|E

5|$|Baruch Kimmerling and Joel S. Migdal {{argue that}} the revolt was a {{formative}} event for the Palestinian sense of nationhood in that it brought together disparate groups against a common enemy. Moreover, they asserted that these groups reemerged later to constitute the Palestinian people. The revolt represented a moment of political unity in Palestine. However, the ultimate intention of the notables and rebel leaders was to force out the Egyptian army and reinstate Ottoman rule {{as a means of}} restoring the Ottoman-era standards that defined the relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and the governed. These standards were made up of the religious laws, administrative codes and local norms and traditions that were disrupted by Egyptian reforms.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, a {{combination}} of developments, from the Great Depression to the vicious spiral of OUN terrorist attacks and government pacifications, caused government relations with the national minorities to deteriorate. Unrest among national minorities was also related to foreign policy. Troubles followed repressions in largely Ukrainian-populated eastern Galicia, where nearly 1,800 persons were arrested. Tension also arose <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and Poland's German minority, particularly in Upper Silesia. The government did not yield to calls for antisemitic measures; but the Jews (8.6% of Poland's population) grew discontented for economic reasons that were connected with the depression. Overall, {{by the end of}} Piłsudski's life, his government's relations with national minorities were increasingly problematic.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, the British {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to integrate the}} princely states more closely with British India, in 1921 creating the Chamber of Princes as a consultative and advisory body, and in 1936 transferring {{the responsibility for the}} supervision of smaller states from the provinces to the centre and creating direct relations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> of India and the larger princely states, superseding political agents. A more ambitious aim was a scheme of federation contained in the Government of India Act 1935, which envisaged the princely states and British India being united under a federal government. This scheme came close to success, but was abandoned in 1939 {{as a result of the}} outbreak of the Second World War. As a result, in the 1940s the relationship between the princely states and the crown remained regulated by the principle of paramountcy and by the various treaties between the British crown and the states.|$|E

5|$|During the {{fighting}} in May 1940, the Pierlot government came into conflict with King Leopold III who had taken personal command of the Belgian Army. The first confrontation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and the King occurred on 10 May, when the King, against {{the wishes of the}} government, left for his military headquarters without addressing the Chamber of Representatives like his father, Albert I, had done in 1914. Contact between the King and the government became sporadic while the government feared that the King was acting beyond his constitutional powers. Like his father, Leopold was subject to Article 64 of the constitution which specified that no act of the King was valid unless counter-signed by a government minister, yet also given supreme power in military matters under Article 68. The two clauses appeared to contradict each other and gave all the king's acts in military-political matters an unclear constitutional footing.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong {{soon became}} a major entrepôt thanks to its free port status, {{attracting}} new immigrants to settle from both China and Europe. The society, however, remained racially segregated and polarised under early British colonial policies. Despite {{the rise of a}} British-educated Chinese upper-class by the late-19th century, race laws such as the Peak Reservation Ordinance prevented ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong from acquiring houses in reserved areas such as Victoria Peak. At this time, the majority of the Chinese population in Hong Kong had no political representation in the British colonial government. The British governors did rely, however, on a small number of Chinese elites, including Sir Kai Ho and Robert Hotung, who served as ambassadors and mediators <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and local population.|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights groups}} such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, {{as well as the}} United States Department of State and the European Union, have {{expressed}} concern about the state of human rights in Sri Lanka, and both the government of Sri Lanka and the rebel LTTE have been accused of human rights violations. Although Amnesty International in 2003 found considerable improvement in the human rights situation, attributed to a ceasefire and peace talks <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and the LTTE, by 2007 they reported an escalation in political killings, child recruitment, abductions, and armed clashes, which created a climate of fear in the north and east of the country.|$|E
