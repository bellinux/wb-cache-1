5|$|Belief in {{prenatal}} fetal awareness, mental communication <b>between</b> <b>mother</b> and unborn child, {{and emotional}} attachment of child to mother as a prenatal phenomenon, are concepts that connect easily to the unfounded assumption that all adopted children suffer emotional disorders. These beliefs are also congruent with CAM psychotherapies such as attachment therapy (not based on attachment theory), which purport {{to bring about}} age regression and to recapitulate early development to produce a better outcome.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, Conroy {{settled at}} his {{family home in}} Arborfield Hall near Reading, Berkshire and became a gentleman farmer, winning prizes for his pig breeding. He founded the Montgomery Regiment of Militia in 1849. Despite his {{pensions}} and ownership of properties and lead mines in Wales, Conroy was in substantial debt when he died on 2 March 1854 at Arborfield. His eldest son Edward succeeded him to the baronetcy. After his death, the Duchess of Kent finally agreed to open her financial accounts and acknowledged that significant funds were missing. She was moved to admit that Conroy had swindled her {{while at the same}} time hurting her relationship with Victoria for his own benefit.

40|$|The {{relationship}} <b>between</b> <b>mothers</b> {{and adolescents}} with less quality {{can be seen}} through adolescent’s attitude which tends to be non-open to speak of matters and it results conflicts <b>between</b> <b>mothers</b> and children. The goal {{of this research is}} to prove the effectiveness of communication skills training in improving the quality of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>mothers</b> and adolescents. The method that is used in the communication skills training is the lecturing method, roleplay, case study, and the imaging method. The quality <b>between</b> <b>mothers</b> and adolescents is measured using the quality scale of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>mothers</b> and children. The subject of this research has amount of 18 mothers which have Senior High School educational background and have children that are adolescents. The data is analyzed using Mann-Withney U Test and Wilcoxon T Test. The result of the research shows the quality of the experimental group that has been given the communication skills training has improved, while the control group has not. Therefore, it can be concluded that communication skills training is effective {{to improve the quality of}} the relationship <b>between</b> <b>mothers</b> and adolescents. The result of qualitative research shows the significant improvement of quality of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>mothers</b> and adolescents is on mothers who have female adolescents who are still in their early teenage years. The improvement of mothers’ skills in doing an open communication with adolescents makes the situation of communication become fun. In this case, adolescents feel comfortable to speak of problems with mothers and they also feel satisfied with the control which is done by mothers so that it can create the feeling of trusting each other, supporting each other, and appreciating each other <b>between</b> <b>mothers</b> and adolescents...|$|R

5|$|In {{all human}} {{cultures}} premastication/kiss-feeding or kissing <b>between</b> <b>mother</b> and infant {{has been observed}} in all with kissing {{believed to be a}} socially ritualized form of feeding premasticated food. There is high similarity in the execution of kiss-feeding and human kisses (e.g. French kiss); in the former, the tongue is used to push food from mother to child with the child receiving both the mother's food and tongue in sucking movements, and the latter simply forgoes the premasticated food. In fact, observations across various species and cultures confirms that the act of kissing and premastication have most likely evolved from the similar relationship-based feeding behaviours.|$|E

5|$|On 6 June 1930, Carol {{arrived in}} Bucharest {{and made his}} way into Parliament, where the Act of Succession 1927 was duly {{declared}} null. Thus, Carol usurped the throne from his son, becoming King Carol II. Upon hearing of Carol's return, Marie, who was abroad, was relieved. She had been growing anxious with the direction in which the country was heading and viewed Carol's return as the return of the Prodigal Son. However, as soon as she arrived in Bucharest, she became aware that things would not go well. Carol refused to accept his mother's advice to take Helen back and never sought Marie's counsel during his reign, thus making the already existing breach <b>between</b> <b>mother</b> and son complete.|$|E

5|$|Purring {{may have}} {{developed}} as an evolutionary advantage {{as a sign}}alling mechanism of reassurance <b>between</b> <b>mother</b> cats and nursing kittens. Post-nursing cats often purr {{as a sign of}} contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, or eating. The mechanism by which cats purr is elusive. The cat has no unique anatomical feature that is clearly responsible for the sound. It was, until recent times, believed that only the cats of the Felis genus could purr. However, felids of the Panthera genus (tiger, lion, jaguar, and leopard) also produce sounds similar to purring, but only when exhaling.|$|E
5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment <b>between</b> <b>mother</b> and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the birth mother and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E
5|$|In 1869 Dunford House was let. Catherine and {{her four}} younger daughters {{moved to a}} house in South Kensington—the eldest, Kate, had married in 1866. The ménage proved unsatisfactory; Ellen, Jane and Anne were now {{displaying}} considerable independence of spirit, and differences of opinion arose <b>between</b> <b>mother</b> and daughters. Catherine moved out, taking the youngest daughter Lucy, and went to Wales where she lived until her death in 1877. In South Kensington, Ellen, Jane and Anne, often joined by Kate, established a sisterhood determined both to preserve Richard Cobden's memory and works and to uphold his principles and radical causes by actions of their own. Together they stopped publication of a memoir of their father, sponsored by his former colleagues and compiled by a family friend, Julie Salis Schwabe. This caused some offence; Schwabe had given the family financial and emotional support after Richard's death. However, Jane in particular wanted a more substantial memorial, and secured the services of John Morley, whose biography of Richard Cobden was published in 1881.|$|E

40|$|Social {{capital has}} been shown to be {{positively}} associated with a range of health outcomes, yet few studies have explored the association between mothers’ social capital and child health. We examine the relationship between mothers' access to social capital via participations in community activities and their children's health. Instrumental variable estimator is used to deal with reverse causality. Data come from the Indonesian Family Life Surveys (IFLS) of 1997, 2000, and 2007. We find strong evidence for the association <b>between</b> <b>mother's</b> social capital and child health before and after the Asian financial crisis. In contrast, there is no relation <b>between</b> <b>mother's</b> social capital and child health during the crisis. The results suggest that the link <b>between</b> <b>mother's</b> social capital and child health is severely ruptured during the period of the crisis, possibly by reducing the number of available community activities and the ability of mothers to participate in such activities. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Parents have {{a control}} {{role in the}} {{development}} and treatment of eating disorders among teenagers. Aim: To compare attitudes, beliefs and behaviors <b>between</b> <b>mothers</b> of patients with eating disorders and mothers of teenagers without these disorders. Material and methods: Twenty one mother-sibling pairs of adolescents with eating disorders and 15 pairs of adolescents without this condition, but of similar age, were studied. The eating disorders inventory (EDI- 2), a self administered questionnaire that includes 91 items, was applied. Results: No differences in any of the subscales of EDI- 2 were observed <b>between</b> <b>mothers</b> of teenagers with or without eating disorders. No differences in perfectionism, maturity fears, impulsivity and interpersonal distrust were observed between adolescents with and without eating disorders. The latter had a lesser drive for thinness and inefficacy.
