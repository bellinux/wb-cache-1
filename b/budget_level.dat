40|$|We {{investigate}} how the <b>budget</b> <b>levels</b> embedded in budget-based contracts affect individual effort and risk-taking. We show that, from a wealth maximization perspective, a tradeoff exists between motivating effort and encouraging risk-taking. We illustrate an inverted-U relation between <b>budget</b> <b>levels</b> and effort. <b>Budget</b> <b>levels</b> and effort are positively correlated until budgets become very difficult, {{at which point}} individuals "give up. " We illustrate an opposing, U-shaped, relation between <b>budget</b> <b>levels</b> and risk-taking. Low budgets provide the flexibility to take greater risks, whereas high budgets induce individuals to "play it safe" to ensure budget attainment. Risky projects provide the greatest probability of reaching very high (stretch) budgets. We conduct a laboratory experiment to empirically test this economic proposition vis-à-vis extant psychology research. Consistent with security-potential/aspiration theory, we find that individuals are willing to sacrifice expected wealth to either meet the budget or increase their potential payoffs. Our {{results suggest that the}} effort-risk tradeoff is mitigated at low <b>budget</b> <b>levels,</b> thereby increasing firm welfare, but is exacerbated at high <b>budget</b> <b>levels,</b> reducing firm welfare. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of understanding how managerial accounting practices such as budgets affect the various determinants of performance and not just performance per se. Our results also help reconcile conflicting evidence regarding where <b>budget</b> difficulty <b>levels</b> should be set. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The Avahan {{programme}} {{has provided}} HIV prevention activities, including condom promotion, to female sex workers (FSWs) in southern India since 2004. Evidence suggests Avahan averted 202, 000 HIV infections over 4 years. For replicating this intervention elsewhere, {{it is essential}} to understand how the intervention’s impact could have been optimised for different <b>budget</b> <b>levels.</b> Methods: Behavioural data were used to determine how condom use varied for FSWs with different levels of intervention intensity. Cost data from 64 Avahan districts quantified how district-level costs related to intervention scale and intensity. A deterministic model for HIV transmission amongst FSWs and clients projected the impact and cost of intervention strategies for different scale and intensity, and identified the optimal strategies that maximise impact for different <b>budget</b> <b>levels.</b> Results: As <b>budget</b> <b>levels</b> increase, the optimal intervention strategy is to first increase intervention intensity which achieves little impact, then scale-up coverage to high levels for large increases in impact, and lastly increase intensity further for small additional gains. The cost-effectiveness of these optimal strategies generally improves with increasing resources, while straying from these strategies can triple costs for the same impact. Projections suggest Avahan was close to being optimal, and moderate budget reductions ($ 20 %) would have reduced impact considerably (. 40 %) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{experimentally}} {{investigate the}} effects of budget-based contracts and budget levels (performance targets) on group performance. We compare a group piece-rate contract with two different specifications of a group budget-based contract: (1) a group budget-fixed contract that provides no remuneration for performance below the budget and a fixed bonus for performance meeting or exceeding the budget, and (2) a group budget-linear contract that provides no remuneration for performance below the budget, a fixed bonus once the budget is attained, plus a piecerate for production {{in excess of the}} budget. We also assigned each group a <b>budget</b> <b>level,</b> set at 50 percent, 75 percent, or 100 percent of the group’s performance capability. The results indicate that the group budget-linear contract led to significantly higher group performance than both the group budget-fixed contract and the group piece-rate contract. Additionally, the 75 percent <b>budget</b> <b>level</b> led to significantly higher group performance than both the 50 percent <b>budget</b> <b>level</b> and the 100 percent <b>budget</b> <b>level.</b> Finally, the variability in group performance was lowest under the group budgetlinear contract and the 75 percent <b>budget</b> <b>level.</b> Collectively, these results demonstrate the efficacy of both certain types of budget-based contracts and ‘‘moderately’ ’ difficult budget goals in enhancing group performance. The results also suggest that both motivation and coordination (planning) can be enhanced by budget levels of moderate difficulty and group budget-linear contracts, as the group budget-linear contract and the 75 percent <b>budget</b> <b>level</b> not only led to the highest level of performance, but also led to the lowest variability in performance...|$|E
