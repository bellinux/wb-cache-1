5000|$|The Cray-1S, {{announced}} in 1979, was an improved Cray-1 that supported a larger main memory of 1, 2 or 4 million words. The larger main memory {{was made possible}} {{through the use of}} 4,096 x 1-bit <b>bipolar</b> <b>RAM</b> ICs with a 25 ns access time. The Data General minicomputers were optionally replaced with an in-house 16-bit design running at 80 MIPS. The I/O subsystem was separated from the main machine, connected to the main system via a 6 MB/s control channel and a 100 MB/s High Speed Data Channel. This separation made the 1S look like two [...] "half Crays" [...] separated by a few feet, which allowed the I/O system to be expanded as needed. Systems could be bought in a variety of configurations from the S/500 with no I/O and 0.5 million words of memory to the S/4400 with four I/O processors and 4 million words of memory.|$|E

These registers are implemented with 1 kilobit (Kbit) <b>bipolar</b> <b>RAM</b> integrated circuits (ICs) with a 4.5 ns access time. All models have eight 256-bit vector mask registers and 48 vector address registers. All models have three load pipelines and one load/store pipeline for accessing the main memory. The S-810/20 has two lanes, each with two add, one multiply followed by add, and one multiply or divide followed by add floating point pipelines, {{for a total of}} twelve. The S-810/10 has one lane with the same configuration as the S-810/20 and therefore a total of six pipelines. CPU logic is implemented with two emitter-coupled logic gate array IC types, a 550-gate part with a 250 picosecond (ps) gate delay and a 1,500-gate part with a 450 ps gate delay.|$|E

During the course of evaluating this model, physical and electrical variations were also evaluated indicating that the minimum internal signal level is the primary upset susceptibility indicator. Unfortunately, all of the physical and electrical variations expected during a normal product development cycle are in direct opposition to improved high-energy particle upset tolerance. Hence, a trade-off between highly susceptible, low power (medium speed) devices must be made against the less susceptible, higher power (high speed) equivalent device, {{taking into account the}} systems trade-off with respect to system power, software, error correction procedures and/or circuit redundancy...|$|R

5000|$|The first depletion-load nMOS {{circuits}} were pioneered {{and made}} by the DRAM manufacturer Mostek, which made depletion-mode transistors available {{for the design of}} the original Zilog Z80 in 1975-76. Mostek had the ion implantation equipment needed to create a doping profile more precise than possible with diffusion methods, so that the threshold voltage of the load transistors could be adjusted reliably. At Intel, depletion load was introduced in 1974 by Federico Faggin, an ex-Fairchild engineer and later the founder of Zilog. Depletion-load was first employed for a redesign of one of Intel's most important products at the time, a +5V-only 1Kbit nMOS SRAM called the 2102 (using more than 6000 transistors). The result of this redesign was the significantly faster 2102A, where the highest performing versions of the chip had access times of less than 100ns, taking MOS memories close to the speed of <b>bipolar</b> <b>RAMs</b> for the first time.|$|R

We can see that both the new and conventional structures have almost equal MTF, which is {{greater than that of}} the noncoated structure. Second Al layer. [...] Similarly, experiments were carried out to evaluate the MTF of the second A 1 layers. Test strips 15 ~m in width and 12, 000 A in thickness were subjected to a temperature of 100 ~ at various current densities. In order to compare the MTF of the new structure with others, three types of test structures B-l, B- 2, and B- 3 were fabricated as shown in Fig. 9 (a), where B- 1 is a conventional structure, B- 2 is the new structure, and B- 3 is a test structure without a first A 1 layer. Data for each structure of the MTF vs. current den-sity is presented in Fig. 9 (b). The thickness of the first A 1 layer is 3000 A, and that of the PSG film is 8000 A. It is noticed that the MTF for the new structure is about five times greater than that of the conven-tional structure.

30|$|The idea {{of using}} a {{floating}} gate (FG) device to obtain a nonvolatile memory device was suggested {{for the first time}} in 1967 by Kahng D and Sze SM at Bell Labs [1]. This was also the first time that the possibility of nonvolatile MOS memory device was recognized. From that day, semiconductor memory has made tremendous contributions to the revolutionary growth of digital electronics since a 64 -bit <b>bipolar</b> <b>RAM</b> chip to be used in the cache memory of an IBM computer was reported in 1969 [2]. Semiconductor memory has always been an indispensable component and backbone of modern electronic systems. All familiar computing platforms ranging from handheld devices to large supercomputers use storage systems for storing data temporarily or permanently [3]. Beginning with punch card which stores a few bytes of data, storage systems have reached to multiterabytes of capacities in comparatively less space and power consumption. Regarding application aspects, the speed of storage systems needs to be as fast as possible [4]. Since Flash memory has become a common component of solid-state disks (SSDs), the falling prices and increased densities have made it more cost-effective for many other applications [5]. Memory devices and most SSDs that use Flash memory are likely to serve very different markets and purposes. Each has a number of different attributes which are optimized and adjusted to best meet the needs of particular users. Because of natural inherent limitations, the long-established memory devices have been shorted out according to their inventions to match with portable electronic data storage systems. Today, the most prominent one is the limited capacity for continued scaling of the electronic device structure. Research is moving along the following paths for embedded Flash devices: (i) scaling down the cell size of device memory, (ii) lowering voltage operation, and (iii) increasing the density of state per memory cell by using a multilevel cell. To sustain the continuous scaling, conventional Flash devices may have to undergo revolutionary changes. Basically, it is expected that an entire DVD collection be in the palm of a hand. Novel device concepts with new physical operationing principles are needed. It is worthwhile to take a look at semiconductor memories against the background of digital systems. The way semiconductor devices are used in a systems environment determines what is required of them in terms of density, speed/power, and functions. It is also worthwhile to look into the economic significance of semiconductor memories and the relative importance of their various types. For the past three and a half decades in existence, the family of semiconductor memories has expanded greatly and achieved higher densities, higher speeds, lower power, more functionality, and lower costs [3, 6, 7]. At the same time, some of the limitations within each type of memory are also becoming more realized. As such, there are several emerging technologies aiming to go beyond those limitations and potentially replace all or most of the existing semiconductor memory technologies to become a universal semiconductor memory (USM). In addition, the rewards for achieving such a device would be to gain control of an enormous market, which has expanded from computer applications to all of consumer electronic products. Looking forward to the future, there are wide ranges of emerging memory applications for automation and information technology to health care. The specification of nonvolatile memory (NVM) is based on the floating gate configuration, which is the feature of an erased gate put into many cells to facilitate block erasure. Among them, designed Flash memories such as NOR and NAND Flash have been developed and then proposed as commercial products into bulk market. They have been considered as the most important products. NOR has high operation speed for both code and data storage applications; on the other hand, NAND has high density for large data storage applications [8]. Since the inception of Flash memory, there has been an exponential growth in its market driven primarily by cell phones and other types of consumer electronic equipment. While, today, integration of a silicon chip is not economical, toys, cards, labels, badges, value paper, and medical disposables could be imagined to be equipped with flexible electronics and memory. With growing demands for high-density digital information storage, memory density with arriving technology has been increased dramatically from the past couple of years. The main drive to develop organic nonvolatile memory is currently for applications of thin-film, flexible, or even printed electronics. One needs a technology to tag everything to electronic functionality which can be foreseen in a very large quantity and at a very low cost on substrates such as plastic and paper. Accessible popularization of roll-to-roll memory commercialization is a way to make an encounter interesting and challenging to have charge storage devices of choice for applications with enormous flexibility and strength. Recently, polymer (plastic memory) and organic memory devices have significant consideration because of their simple processes, fast operating speed, and excellent switching ability [9, 10]. One significant advantage polymer memory has over conventional memory designs is that it can be stacked vertically, yielding a three-dimensional (3 -D) use of space [11]. This means that in terabyte solid-state devices with extremely low transistor counts such as drives about the size of a matchbook, the data persists even after power is removed. The NAND Flash market is continually growing by the successive introduction of innovative devices and applications. To meet the market trend, 3 -D NVMs are expected to replace the planar ones, especially for 10 -nm nodes and beyond. Moreover, simple-structure organic bistable memory exhibiting superior memory features has been realized by employing various nanoparticles (NPs) blended into a single-layered organic material sandwiched between two metal electrodes [12, 13]. The NPs act as traps that can be charged and discharged by suitable voltage pulses. NP blends show promising data retention times, switching speed, and cycling endurance, but the on-state current is too low to permit scaling to nanometer dimensions [10, 14]. A lot of these great ideas tend to die before reaching this point of development, but that is not to say that we will be seeing plastic memory on store shelves next year. There are still many hurdles to get over; software alone is a big task, as is the manufacturing process, but it does bring this technology one step closer to reality [15]. It is not an exaggeration to say that the equivalent of 400, 000 CDs, 60, 000 DVDs, or 126  years of MPG music may be stored on a polymer memory chip the size of a credit card.|$|E

Memory error frequency will increase due {{to the use of}} larger memory system and higher density memory RAMs, which are more susceptible to soft errors because of their smaller memory cell geometry. The Error Detection and Correction AM 2960 allows correction of any single bit error and detection of all double and some triple bit errors. In this paper, the design of highly memory subsystem based on the use of AM 2960 is presented. Since the AM 2960 EDC unit improves the reliability of the overall system, diagnostic software is developed to check the operation of the EDC itself.
