5|$|Soon after Chandler took office, {{it became}} clear that he could not fund the social {{programs}} initiated by Clements and Wetherby, plus Chandler's own proposed programs, with the revenue presently being brought into the state treasury. He cut the popular Youth Authority, initiated by Wetherby to unify the state's children's welfare programs, but the savings were not enough to <b>balance</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b> <b>In</b> order to deliver on his campaign promises, Chandler ignored the budget during the regular legislative session in 1956, then called a special session during which he presented his budget proposal. The proposal called for spending in excess of $46million more than officials estimated would be brought into the state's coffers over the two-year budget. Chandler convinced legislators to pass the budget, promising to propose a tax plan to pay for the expenditures in a subsequent special session. The promised package added 150,000 citizens to the state's tax rolls, put a surtax on income taxes, and cut tax credits. It created a new 5 percent production tax on whisky, and added taxes to deeds and life insurance premiums. It increased the state gasoline tax for trucks by two cents per gallon and raised corporate taxes by half a percent. In addition, it transferred the assessment and collection of taxes on certain intangibles from local to state government. The plan also called for a $100million bond issue, allowing the allocation of generous budgets for state universities and colleges and improvements to the state highway system.|$|E

40|$|I {{examine a}} {{situation}} where a firm chooses to locate a new factory in one of several jurisdictions. The value of the factory may differ among jurisdictions and {{it depends on the}} private information held by each jurisdiction. Jurisdictions compete for the location of the new factory. This competition may take the form of expenditures already incurred on infrastructure, commitments to spend on infrastructure, tax incentives or even cash payments. The model combines two elements that are usually considered separately; competition is desirable because we want the factory to be located in the jurisdiction that values it the most, but competition in itself is wasteful. I show that the expected total amount paid to the firm under a large family of arrangements is the same. Moreover, I show that the ex-ante optimal mechanism - that is, the mechanism that guarantees that the firm chooses the jurisdiction with the highest value for the factory, minimizes the total expected payment to <b>the</b> firm, and <b>balances</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>in</b> an ex-ante sense - can be implemented by running a standard auction and subsidizing participation. ...|$|R

50|$|According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), tax {{expenditures}} dis-proportionally benefit {{those with}} high incomes. CBPP estimated that the top 1% of U.S. households by income received approximately 17% of the tax expenditure benefits in 2013, while the top 20% received 51%. The top 20% pay 84% of the federal income taxes; this figure does not include payroll taxes. For scale, 50% of the $1.5 trillion in tax expenditures in 2016 is $750 billion, while the U.S. budget deficit was approximately $600 billion. In other words, eliminating the tax expenditures for just the top 20% could theoretically <b>balance</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>in</b> the short-run, although economic effects from changing the incentives may reduce {{the impact on the}} deficit.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results from a {{laboratory}} experiment designed to study political distortions in the accumulation of public debt. A legislature bargains over the levels of a public good and of district specific transfers in two periods. The legislature can issue or purchase risk-free bonds {{in the first period}} and the level of public debt creates a dynamic linkage across policymaking periods. In line with the theoretical predictions, we find that public policies are inefficient and efficiency is increasing {{in the size of the}} majority requirement, with higher investment in public goods and lower debt associated with larger majority requirements. Also in line with the theory, we find that debt is lower when the probability of a negative shock to the economy in the second period is higher, evidence that legislators use debt to smooth consumption. The experiment also highlights two phenomena that are not predicted by standard theories and have not been previously documented. First, <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>in</b> each period appears to be a focal point for some legislators, leading to lower distortions than predicted. Second, higher majority requirements induce significant delays in reaching an agreement...|$|R
