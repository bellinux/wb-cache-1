Because if you say the king cannot be criticised, {{it means that the}} king is not human", he claimed. [...] "If the king can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong." [...] A widespread <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticisms</b> resulted, followed by a sharp rise in lèse-majesté prosecutions. Lèse-majesté cases rose from five or six a year pre-2005 to 478 in 2010.|$|E

5000|$|Despite Liang's {{contribution}} to designing national {{emblem of the}} People's Republic of China and helping with the reconstruction of Beijing, his theory of architecture, which emphasized the greatness of Chinese building tradition, was severely and publicly criticized; Liang was accused of [...] "thinking that the Communist Party did not understand architecture", and that his affinity to traditional designs was a [...] "phenomenon of waste in construction". In 1955, both Liang and his wife Lin Huiyin, already in precarious health, were both dealt a great emotional and spiritual blow by the <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticisms</b> for their efforts to revive China's traditional architecture, that their health both worsened. His wife, in particular, had succumbed to her long ailment in April 1955 after beaten their doctor's prognosis on the estimated time left in her life with tuberculosis by several years. In 1956 Liang was forced to self-criticize and admit {{that he had made}} [...] "mistakes"; which were deemed by the authorities as [...] "academic mistakes", rather than [...] "political mistakes". Although the open criticisms against Liang and his beleaguered ideals for a new China with a [...] "national character" [...] had already stopped, the new focus of open criticisms and calls for self-criticism had suddenly shifted against the academics of philosophy and social sciences represented by such scholars as Hu Shi, Hu Feng, and Liang Shuming.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Euro crisis in 2009 a succession of one “last chance” meeting after another has exposed deep rifts over the policies to implement in order to ensure the permanence of the Euro. From austerity measures to curb swelling public deficits put forward by Germany to European growth plans and solidarity mechanisms suggested by France disagreements have been deep and infighting widespread. The agreement of a new European treaty creating a tight fiscal pact, at the European Summit on 7 December 2011, brought these tensions to the fore, leading to a <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticisms</b> in France against Germany imposing its austerity agenda on the whole Eurozone. This article seeks to analyse how Germany has been portrayed in the French political discourse by focusing on the vast array of reactions to this new treaty. It will show a discursive struggle between three discourse types representing Germany as an evil force intent on dominating Europe, a virtuous ant unwittingly dominating Europe and an economic giant but a political dwarf. These discourses will show how Germany is trapped into past representations and how they reveal far more about France’s self-image in relation to its neighbour than about Germany itself...|$|E
40|$|Confusion, an {{in-depth}} psychotherapy was undertaken. The contract included: resolution of Theresa’s early affect confusion; how archaic conflicts effected conflicts in her {{relationships in the}} present; and to “find alternative ways of stabilizing herself other than raging or demanding attention for her helplessness”. What began as few memories in Theresa’s childhood progressed to more awareness within the therapeutic relationship. The methods of a phenomenological and historical inquiry, attunement to Theresa’s affect, her developmental levels, and relational needs, {{and the process of}} involvement that included acknowledgement, validation, and normalization of her attempts to resolve conflicts in her childhood were evident in Richard’s interactions with Theresa. A few illustrations of the methods of Inquiry, Attunement, and Involvement that appear in this case study follow. You may notice that under inquiry I have included “here-and-now ” inquiry since this is a critical component in Integrative Psychotherapy. In his responses, Richard uses the term “relational inquiry”. Inquiry – Phenomenological inquiry-“I regularly inquired about her body sensations and what she was feeling” Historical inquiry- “She was now able to talk about her teen-age years [...] ”; “With each exploration she began to remember humiliating school situations and eventually her mother’s constant <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticisms</b> and ridiculing comments”...|$|E

5000|$|Under a <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticism,</b> Arthur {{resigned}} from the Legislative Council and his reputation in Government circles as a voice of African interests was irreversibly damaged. The Kenya Government Department of Native Affairs were scathing in their assessment of the FGM controversy, describing Arthur as being [...] "fanatical" [...] in his views. [...] Arthur had misread the political mood of the Kikuyu. In adhering to his principles, he paid a heavy price. Nevertheless, he maintained the confidence of his missionary colleagues and many Kikuyu Christians.|$|R

This paper considers how the colony under Arthur struggled with the government’s responsibility to protect vulnerable children in its midst...|$|R
