5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons I have ever been privileged to hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} that if one sheep from a flock of 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically about that single sheep until it is safely found. There are too many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why do we not? I remain concerned in these turbulent times, <b>but</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> for your patience. It has been my privilege {{to be able to}} speak in your Lordships' House.|$|E
500|$|Berry {{received}} $12.5million for {{the title}} role in the film Catwoman, a $100million movie; it grossed $17million on its first weekend. She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, <b>but</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you.</b> When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner." [...] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a [...] "pet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{highlights}} of [...] "Going Crazy" [...] was the featured rapper Bang Yong-guk, whom fans praised his performance for his [...] "husky and fiery delivery". The song garnered him popularity {{as he was}} on top of major portal search rankings in South Korea after the song's release. Additionally, Yong Guk has been requested for multiple broadcast appearances as representatives expressed interest in his [...] "handsome looks and professional stage performances". However, TS Entertainment declined the offer and stated that “He’s still a trainee so he’s not set to appear in broadcasts other than for ‘Going Crazy’ promotions. However, thank you for giving your support to a new singer“. Representatives from TS Entertainment shared their views on Bang Yong-guk's performance and said, “Despite being a rookie, he received the opportunity to participate in Song Ji Eun’s solo album. He may be lacking, <b>but</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> for showing him your interest.” Through Naver, Yongguk shared his sentiments on promoting [...] "Going Crazy": ...|$|E

[...] "I have oft since thought what a foolish figure I should have cut had I met thee among the Badgers, after having given leg bail because I might not brook seeing thee wedded to her. For I was sore tempted--only thou wast free, and mine indenture held me fast." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Offended!" [...] said Martin, [...] "if she is I {{know nothing}} of women" [...] (as {{a matter of fact}} he didn't.) [...] "No, she will be very pleased; she'll take it away and read it by herself, and sleep with it under her pillow until she knows it by heart, and then I daresay she will ask you to come and see her.

6000|$|Corp {{tried to}} think. [...] "I said, 'This cows, Grizel, <b>but</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> kindly,'" [...] he answered, much {{pleased with his}} effort of memory, but the doctor {{interrupted}} him rudely. [...] "Nobody wants {{to hear what you}} said, you dottrel; what more did she say?" [...] And thus encouraged Corp remembered that she had said she hoped he would not forget her. [...] "What for should I forget her when I see her ilka day?" [...] he asked, and was probably about to divulge that this was his reply to her, but without waiting for more, McQueen turned his beast's head and drove to the entrance to the Double Dykes. Here he alighted and hastened up the path on foot, but before he reached the house he met Dite Deuchars taking his ease beneath a tree, and Dite could tell him that Grizel was not at home. [...] "But there's somebody in Double Dykes," [...] he said, [...] "though I kenna wha could be there unless it's the ghost of the Painted Lady hersel'. About an hour syne I saw Grizel come out o' the house, carrying a bundle, but she hadna gone many yards when she turned round and waved her hand to the east window. I couldna see wha was at it, but there maun have been somebody, for first the crittur waved to the window and next she kissed her hand to it, and syne she went on a bit, and syne she ran back close to the window and nodded and flung more kisses, and back and forrit she went a curran times as if she could hardly tear hersel' awa'. 'Wha's that you're so chief wi'?' I speired when she came by me at last, but she just said, 'I won't tell you,' in her dour wy, and she hasna come back yet." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{postal guide}} tells me, disobligingly, {{that there is}} no mail to you via San Francisco this month and that I must confide my few lines to the {{precarious}} and perfidious Hamburg. I do so, then, for the plain reason that I can no longer repress the enthusiasm that has surged within me ever since I read Catriona. I missed, just after doing so, last month's post, and I was infinitely vexed that it should not have conveyed to you the freshness of my rapture. For the said Catriona so reeks and hums with genius {{that there is no}} refuge for the desperate reader but in straightforward prostration. I'm not sure that it's magnanimous of you to succeed so inconsiderately--there is a modesty in easy triumph which your flushed muse perhaps a little neglects.--But forgive that lumbering image--I won't attempt to carry it out. Let me only say that I don't despatch these ineffectual words on their too watery way to do anything <b>but</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> for an exquisite pleasure. I hold that when a book has the high beauty of that one there's a poor indelicacy in what simple folk call criticism. The work lives by so absolute a law that it's grotesque to prattle about what might have been! I shall express to you the one point in which my sense was conscious of an unsatisfied desire, but only after saying first how rare an achievement I think the whole personality and tone of David and with how supremely happy a hand you have coloured the palpable women. They are quite too lovely and everyone is running after them. In David not an error, not a false note ever; he is all of an exasperating truth and rightness. The one thing I miss in the book is the note of visibility--it subjects my visual sense, my seeing imagination, to an almost painful underfeeding. The hearing imagination, as it were, is nourished like an alderman, and the loud audibility seems a slight the more on the baffled lust of the eyes--so that I seem to myself (I am speaking of course only {{from the point of view}} of the way, as I read, my impression longs to complete itself) in the presence of voices in the darkness--voices the more distinct and vivid, the more brave and sonorous, as voices always are--but also the more tormenting and confounding--by reason of these bandaged eyes. I utter a pleading moan when you, e.g., transport your characters, toward the end, in a line or two from Leyden to Dunkirk without the glint of a hint of all the ambient picture of the 18th century road. However, stick to your own system of evocation so long as what you positively achieve is so big. Life and letters and art all take joy in you.|$|E
5000|$|C. S. Lewis, in Book Five, chapter III (The Self-Sufficiency of Vertue) of {{his early}} autobiographical work The Pilgrims Regress (1933) {{included}} a quote from the last two lines (paraphrased by the character [...] "Vertue"): I cannot put myself under anyones orders. I must be the captain of my soul and the master of my fate. <b>But</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> for your offer..|$|E

Dave, I’ll not offer you a reward, for I know you won’t take it. <b>But</b> I <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> my boy, I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> most heartily!” And Mr. Wadsworth caught Dave by both hands, while tears of emotion stood in his eyes.|$|R

5000|$|According to his son, Leven died on December 17, 2007. He was 93. Mel leven was {{divorced}} {{and had two}} children, Bill Leven and a daughter Laurie Fondiler/Leven. His first wife was Vera and second wife' mother of Bill and Laurie was, Jeanie Francis. I, laurie leven fondiler, rewrote some of this. My dad was Jewish and was a atheist. I don't know who wrote this but many facts are wrong. <b>But,</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> for writing this. He was an amazing man. So smart, creative and complicated. We loved him very much. He had the best sense of humor. He made people laugh.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first person}} to top the 100 Sexiest list more than once was Jennifer Lopez, who was placed at number one in both 2000 and 2001. Speaking about being named the sexiest {{woman in the world}} for a second year running, Lopez said she was [...] "overwhelmed", and added: [...] "Any woman who says they don't like being called sexy, they're lying." [...] By 2002, the list was {{attracting}} over five million votes - that year, Russian tennis player Anna Kournikova was number one. A further five million votes were cast the following year, when the American actress Halle Berry was named as the world's sexiest. At 36 years old, Berry was the oldest woman ever to top the list. She responded: [...] "Wow, that's a pretty heady title. I'm not so sure I live up to it, <b>but</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> anyway." [...] The first British woman to top the listing was the model Kelly Brook, who was named the world's sexiest in 2005, the most successful poll to that point.|$|E
5000|$|Cahill's book, A Saint on Death Row: The Story of Dominique Green, is a {{departure}} from The Hinges of History series. It is both the story of Dominique Green, {{a young man from}} Houston who was on Death Row in Texas, and of the effect that knowing him had on Cahill. Arrested at age eighteen in the fatal shooting of a man during a robbery outside a Houston convenience store, Green acknowledged he took part in the robbery but insisted he did not pull the trigger. Cahill first heard about Green from Judge Sheila Murphy who was working on the appeal of the case. She requested that he visit Green, which he did in December 2003. So impressed was Cahill with Green that he joined the ultimately-unsuccessful fight for Green's life, even enlisting Green's hero, Desmond Tutu, to make a historic visit to Dominique and to plead publicly for mercy. Green was executed at the age of 30 on October 26, 2004, after spending twelve years on Death Row. Green made a final statement before he was killed: [...] "There was {{a lot of people that}} got me to this point and I can't thank them all. <b>But</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> for your love and support. They have allowed me to do a lot more than I could have on my own. I have overcome a lot. I am not angry but I am disappointed that I was denied justice. But I am happy that I was afforded you all as family and friends. I love you all. Please just keep the struggle going. I am just sorry and I am not as strong as I thought I was going to be. But I guess it only hurts for a little while. You are all my family. Please keep my memory alive." ...|$|E
