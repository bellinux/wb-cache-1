50|$|During the First World War the Steiger firm {{repaired}} aeroplanes and aeroplane engines. In 1917 {{the owner}} and his engineer, Paul Henze, began to work on motorized vehicles. Plans for the manufacture of tractors were abandoned in favour {{of the development of}} automobiles. Their first model, the Steiger 10/50 PS, was produced in 1920. This touring model with a 2.6 litre four cylinder engine (50 hp / 37 kW) became Steiger’s most significant product, and was still in production when the firm collapsed in 1926. Its modern OHC engine was distinctive because of an overhead camshaft driven by spiral-toothed <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> <b>wheels.</b> These cars, with ‘u’ shaped pressed steel frames, two axles with leaf spring suspension and a pointed radiator, were considered to be the most significant technical innovation of the early 1920s and the most progressive German serially-produced cars of their time.|$|R

40|$|Defining {{manufacturing}} tolerances {{is an important}} task for a process planner before starting production of a new product or introducing new processes. One of the more complex processes to handle is the heat treatment of gears. Press quenching is a heat treatment method where the gear is mechanically forced to keep or attain the desired geometry, with less geometrical distortions in comparison to oil bath quenching. The objective {{of this paper is}} to discover how design of experiments can be used to scrutinize press quenching of <b>bevel</b> <b>gears.</b> The first part of this investigation shows how different process parameter settings influence geometry of the <b>bevel</b> <b>gear.</b> Based on the results of the experiments, predictions and statistical simulations, the outcome of the press quenching process can be estimated. Estimations for the number of defect parts then form the basis for evaluating whether the proposed tolerances meet the quality requirements. The work is based on an industrial case where 55 <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> crown <b>wheels</b> for heavy trucks are carburized and then case hardened in a Gleason press quenching machine.

40|$|The {{subject is}} the {{aircraft}} <b>bevel</b> <b>gears,</b> which {{are part of}} the drive systems of gas turbine engines and helicopter transmissions. The article deals with defect specifics of the aircraft conical gears with a circular tooth as compared to the conical <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> of general engineering. The finite element method has been used to find by calculation that the main reason for destruction of aircraft <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> is a resonant vibration excitation of the <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> rim due to its nodal diameter eigenvibrations happened to be within the operating range of the transmission rotation frequencies. A parametric finite element model has been developed. It allows us to investigate the impact of modification parameters of the drive side of <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> on the function of the kinematic transmission error at different values of transmitted torque. Using the method of main coordinates, a reduced dynamic model of the <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> has been developed to allow simulating the vibration intensity of <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> with various parameters of the working profile modification. Within the framework of evaluation test of the dynamic model, amplitude-frequency characteristics have been constructed for the main parameters of transmission oscillations, including vibrational stresses in the teeth space. It is found that modification parameters of the transmission drive side {{have a significant effect on}} the vibration intensity of the <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> in the entire operating range. The main factor affecting the vibration stress amplitude in the <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> is the amplitude of the kinematic error function with the corresponding torque transmitted. The obtained research results can be used when designing the new aircraft drives and modernizing the existing ones. As part of the further development, it is expected to create a technique for recording the damage accumulation in the conical gears, taking into account the typical flight profile of a gas turbine engine or a helicopter. </p...|$|R
