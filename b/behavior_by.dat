5|$|Behaviorists {{focus on}} the {{acquisition}} and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping <b>behavior</b> <b>by</b> making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It {{is important to note}} that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant. Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.|$|E
5|$|Farmers exploit {{flocking}} {{behavior to}} keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as hill farming, {{and to move}} them more easily. For this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this effort, with a highly bred herding ability. Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food. Those who are moving sheep may exploit this <b>behavior</b> <b>by</b> leading sheep with buckets of feed.|$|E

Critics heavily panned the film citing substandard acting, heavy use of stereotypical characters, a hole-filled plot, unused subplots, and the use of a live tiger resulting in almost all attacks being implied rather than seen.|$|E

5|$|The Gypsy Restaurant and Velvet Lounge was a {{restaurant}} and nightclub established in 1947 and located along Northwest 21st Avenue in the Northwest District neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Popular with young adults, the restaurant was known for serving fishbowl alcoholic beverages, for its 1950s furnishings, and for hosting karaoke, trivia competitions and goldfish racing tournaments. The restaurant {{is said to have}} influenced local alcohol policies; noise complaints and signs of drunken <b>behavior</b> <b>by</b> patrons made the business a target for curfews and closure.

5|$|Manager Carrigan allowed Ruth {{to pitch}} two {{exhibition}} games in mid-August. Although Ruth won both against minor-league competition, {{he was not}} restored to the pitching rotation. It is uncertain why Carrigan did not give Ruth additional opportunities to pitch. There are legends—filmed for the screen in The Babe Ruth Story (1948)—that the young pitcher {{had a habit of}} signaling his intent to throw a curveball by sticking out his tongue slightly, and that he was easy to hit until this changed. Creamer pointed out that it is common for inexperienced pitchers to display such habits, and the need to break Ruth of his would not constitute a reason to not use him at all. The biographer suggested that Carrigan was unwilling to use Ruth due to poor <b>behavior</b> <b>by</b> the rookie.|$|E
5|$|Themes from Plato and his {{influence}} on Western political philosophy are also {{prevalent in the}} novel.

He argues that it is the ruler's role, as well as his duty and obligation, to bring about the good society, and this can only be done by the imposition of absolute order from above. The dictator’s job is to bring about the Good Society, to impose the needed order, and the people's job is to obey the dictator, thereby enjoying the fruits of the good society. The result of such <b>behavior</b> <b>by</b> both the ruler and the ruled will be good for everyone.|$|E
