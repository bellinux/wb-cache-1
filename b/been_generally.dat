The manner of determining the source of income <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> dependent {{on the nature of}} income.

5|$|Though {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} ungainly and awkward when on the ground, {{the anatomy of}} some pterosaurs (particularly pterodactyloids) suggests that they were competent walkers and runners. Early pterosaurs have long been considered particularly cumbersome locomotors due {{to the presence of}} large cruropatagia, but they too appear to have <b>been</b> <b>generally</b> efficient on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{under the}} Aros settlement's defences indicate {{the site was}} a town {{as early as the}} last quarter of the 8thcentury, considerably earlier than had <b>been</b> <b>generally</b> supposed. Discoveries after a 2003 archaeological dig unearthed half-buried longhouses, firepits, glass pearls and a road dated to the late 700s. Archaeologists have conducted several excavations in the inner city since the 1960s revealing wells, streets, homes and workshops. In the buildings and adjoining archaeological layers, everyday utensils like combs, jewellery and basic multi-purpose tools from approximately the year 900 have been found.|$|E

5|$|Commentary on {{the album}} has {{included}} discussion of its minimal instrumentation and the interjection of unexpected sounds. Reviewers have described the lyrics on the songs as unconventional and dark, and noted the prominence of vocal harmonies between the Deal sisters. The reception of Title TK has <b>been</b> <b>generally</b> positive; appraisal has included commendation for Albini's contributions {{to the sound of}} the album, and for how the recordings isolate individual instruments.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of Rapunzel has <b>been</b> <b>generally</b> positive, with critics complimenting her spirited, lively personality and independence. The tenth Disney Princess, Rapunzel was officially {{inducted into the}} line-up on October 2, 2011, becoming the franchise's first computer-animated member. Her physical appearance and personality have drawn much comparison between her and preceding Disney Princess Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989), by whom she was inspired.|$|E
5|$|Dot has <b>been</b> <b>generally</b> well {{received}} by critics; {{she has been}} referred to as a cultural archetype and Brown has won multiple awards for her portrayal. However, aspects of the character such as her smoking and her religious beliefs have been criticised, with religious groups suggesting Dot's faith is used in a pejorative manner. The character has also made an impact on popular culture; she has been spoofed, most notably by Alistair McGowan, and has been credited as inspiration for catwalk collections.|$|E

It has <b>been</b> <b>generally</b> well received by critics. Its season finale debuted on October 31, 2014.|$|E
5|$|He has <b>been</b> <b>generally</b> well-received by video-game critics. Tidus' cheerful {{personality}} and heroic traits make him an appealing protagonist, contrasting with previous male {{characters in the}} franchise. His character development and romantic relationship with Yuna are considered {{among the best in}} video games, although reviewers and fans were divided on Taylor's voicing. Tidus has been popular with fans, often ranking {{as one of the best}} Final Fantasy characters in polls. Action figures and Tidus-related jewelry have been produced, and he is a popular cosplay character.|$|E
5|$|Individually, {{each game}} in the series has <b>been</b> <b>generally</b> well received. In 1995, Dark Forces became LucasArts' highest sell-in with more than 300,000 copies {{accounted}} for at launch. Games in the series have achieved consistently favorable review scores from most publications, and hold high aggregate scores on both Metacritic and GameRankings. The only exceptions are the PlayStation version of Dark Forces, which was perceived to have graphical problems and the GameCube version of Jedi Outcast, which was seen as considerably inferior to the PC and Xbox versions.|$|E

5|$|Khmer Krom or Southern Khmer {{is spoken}} by the {{indigenous}} Khmer {{population of the}} Mekong Delta, formerly controlled by the Khmer Empire but part of Vietnam since 1698. Khmers are persecuted by the Vietnamese government for using their native language and, since the 1950s, {{have been forced to}} take Vietnamese names. Consequently, very little research has been published regarding this dialect. It has <b>been</b> <b>generally</b> influenced by Vietnamese for three centuries and accordingly displays a pronounced accent, tendency toward monosyllablic words and lexical differences from Standard Khmer.|$|E
5|$|Light {{guns were}} {{suppressed}} {{for a time}} in the United States after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre and its attendant controversy over video games and gun crime. Since the late 1980s light gun controllers have <b>been</b> <b>generally</b> manufactured to look like toys by painting them in bright colours. In Japan, which lacks the gun crime found in the United States and in which civilians cannot legally own guns, more realistic light guns are widely available.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a full-length opera, Twice was composed between 1994 and 1996, undergoing substantial reworking before Turnage found a form with which he was satisfied. It was first performed in 1997 when it was put on both in the concert hall and in the opera house. The critical reception has <b>been</b> <b>generally</b> favourable, with several authors commenting positively about the instrumental writing and emotional impact of the work, though some critics see limitations in the libretto, find the mood of the work too unrelenting or note the great demands that the vocal writing provides for the soloist.|$|E

5|$|Spanish {{botanist}} Antonio José Cavanilles described B.oblongifolia in 1800, {{though it}} was known as Banksia asplenifolia in New South Wales for many years. However, the latter name, originally coined by Richard Anthony Salisbury, proved invalid, and Banksia oblongifolia has been universally adopted as the correct scientific name since 1981. Two varieties were recognised in 1987, but these have not <b>been</b> <b>generally</b> accepted. A wide array of mammals, birds, and invertebrates visit the inflorescences. Though easily grown as a garden plant, it is not commonly seen in horticulture.|$|E
5|$|The Mercians, {{who participated}} in Edwin's defeat in 633, seem to have {{presented}} an obstacle to Oswald's authority south of the Humber, although it has <b>been</b> <b>generally</b> thought that Oswald dominated Mercia to some degree after Heavenfield. It may have been to appease Oswald that Penda had Eadfrith, a captured son of Edwin (and thus a dynastic rival of Oswald), killed, although {{it is also possible}} that Penda had his own motives for the killing.|$|E
5|$|The {{company has}} {{emphasized}} outreach to underprivileged schools in its business decisions. As of 2015, more than 35,000 schools use Flocabulary {{products in the}} classroom. Flocabulary has been praised by rapper Snoop Dogg, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, and historian Howard Zinn, and the company's products have <b>been</b> <b>generally</b> well received by educators and the press. However, the project {{has been criticized for}} perceived cultural inauthenticity and politically charged material in some song lyrics.|$|E
