5|$|Early enemy designs {{included}} tanks, combat planes, and battleships. Nishikado, however, was {{not satisfied}} with the enemy movements; technical limitations made it difficult to simulate flying. Humans would have <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> simulate, but Nishikado considered shooting them immoral. After seeing a magazine feature about Star Wars, he thought of using a space theme. Nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds—he had watched the 1953 film adaptation as a child—and created initial bitmap images after the octopus-like aliens. Other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs. The game was originally titled Space Monsters, inspired by a popular song in Japan at the time ("Monster"), but was changed to Space Invaders by Nishikado's superiors.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{remastering}} {{work was}} outsourced to the Shanghai-based studio Virtuos. Square Enix's internal staff was responsible for reassembling the original assets, and helped with a part of redoing the high-definition data. Among the returning original team members were Motomu Toriyama, Yusuke Naora, Toshitaka Matsuda and Masaki Kobayashi who supervised the production. X-2 art director Shintaro Takai remained in the same role for both remastered games. The Chinese side of development was headed by managing director Pan Feng. The team encountered problems in porting the games to PlayStation 3 and Vita as their graphics used many functionalities unique to the PlayStation 2 hardware. The loss and repair {{of some of the}} original assets posed another hurdle, with Kitase commenting that it might have <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> recreate the data from the ground up.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is famous}} for a New Year celebration where lighted tar barrels are carried on the heads of revellers called guisers. This {{tradition}} dates back to 1858. It appears to have originated from the lighting of a silver band that were carolling at New Year. They were unable to use candles to light their music due to the strong winds, so someone suggested a tar barrel be used. Having to move from place to place, it would have <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> carry the barrels upon the guisers' heads, rather than rolling them. There have been claims {{that it is a}} pagan festival, however, these claims are unfounded.|$|E

25|$|One of nine {{changes to}} the {{starting}} eleven, Redmond produced an outstanding performance as Birmingham outclassed Maribor in the last group stage fixture. Apart from Jovan Vidović's early header that went wide, the attacking play was all Birmingham's. After 24 minutes, Rooney scored his first European goal, a close-range header from a Redmond cross, then Žigić failed {{to take a couple}} of chances, Davies failed to make contact with a Redmond corner when it would have <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> score, and Redmond himself hit a half-volley against the post from distance. His marker, Arghus, was perhaps fortunate to escape a red card for a high tackle born of frustration. But ten-man Braga could only draw with Brugge, so Birmingham's ten points were not enough.|$|E
25|$|According to Pascal Lamy of the World Trade Organisation, all Post-Soviet {{states that}} buy gas from Gazprom should pay market prices {{to improve the}} {{efficiency}} of their economies. Lamy stated {{that it would have}} <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> resolve the conflict if both Russia and Ukraine had been WTO members. Moreover, he added that the problem had arisen in the first place because neither Russia nor Ukraine experience true market prices, producing inefficient energy uses amongst the states. He added that the incident would not influence Russia's acceptance into the WTO. Illarionov noted in this respect {{that there is no such}} thing as a market price for gas, because Russia offers different terms for analogous countries, e.g. gas price for Ukraine is not calculated in the same way as for Germany.|$|E
500|$|The myth of Myrrha {{is closely}} linked to that of her son, Adonis, which has <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> trace. Adonis is the Hellenized form of the Phoenician word [...] "adoni", meaning [...] "my lord". It is {{believed}} that the cult of Adonis was known to the Greeks from around the sixth century B.C., but it is unquestionable that they came to know it through contact with Cyprus. Around this time, the cult of Adonis is noted in the Book of Ezekiel in Jerusalem, though under the Babylonian name Tammuz.|$|E

500|$|The film's title {{came from}} the song [...] "Naan Paadum Mouna Ragam", from Ratnam's Idaya Kovil (1985). Although he began work on the script while making Pallavi Anu Pallavi, Mouna Ragam did not begin {{production}} until after Idaya Kovil release. Ratnam said that due to budgetary constraints it would have <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> send the female lead to Bangalore instead of Delhi, {{but he did not}} want her to be able to easily return to her parents because she could not adjust to her husband. The line [...] "Neenga thottaa kambilipoochi oorraa madhri irukku", spoken by Divya to Chandrakumar, expressed how she would feel on her wedding night.|$|E
500|$|Edge {{wrote that}} Titanfall major issue was the Xbox One, which {{performed}} less admirably {{compared to the}} PC version. GameSpot Chris Watters acknowledged that the PC's higher resolution was expected and that the Xbox 360 version had an even lower resolution, frame rate issues, and texture pop-in, though it still handled the game well. Peter Bright of Ars Technica wrote that the game's visuals were [...] "lacking", with flat lighting and static environments. OXM Mikel Reparaz thought that the title {{should have been a}} launch release, where it would have <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> overlook its sparse content. Minding the processing power behind the battles, the reviewers were not particularly impressed by the graphics. Eurogamer Dan Whitehead compared the game's aesthetics to Pacific Rim and District 9.|$|E

Nevertheless, the StargateSG-1 actors and producers complimented Corin Nemec and the character. Richard Dean Anderson was impressed with Nemec's performance in [...] "Meridian", saying [...] "he really struck me as a bright guy, very respectful of the dynamic of the set, but with an awareness of what he wanted to bring." [...] Don S. Davis (General Hammond) noted during the filming of season6 that [...] "Corin is a wonderful [...] young man with a tremendous personality and he's had a great deal of experience in the business", agreeing with writer Robert C. Cooper that Nemec had done a [...] "fine" [...] and [...] "wonderful" [...] job.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren {{performed}} at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival at Camber Sands in April 2001. The festival was curated by the band Tortoise, with whom Herren toured as the opening act in May 2001. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives was released on June 11, 2001 through Warp on vinyl, compact disc and download. It was Warp's second release by an American musician, following Richard Devine's Lipswitch which had been released in the previous January. The album did not chart in the United States or United Kingdom. Herren was not happy on how the album was promoted, saying: [...] "I couldn't understand why they were treating me like I was 10. They were ignoring all the cultural references that were to be found throughout that first record."

500|$|Tessa's death {{occurs in}} the fourth episode of the second season; [...] "The Darkness". The {{creative}} staff decided Tessa would die in a random carjacking incident. Tessa's death played {{no role in the}} episode's main storyline. It was not formulaic; the writers wanted to shock the audience. Abramowitz said that [...] "...it would have <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> kill her off in the episode," [...] but the writers [...] "...wanted it to be a surprise and show how shocking [...] was to [...]" [...] Horvath said that [...] "...losing a loved one to a random act of violence isn't something that only happens to television action heroes or Immortals or people in another type of life, it happens in the real world too- totally unexpectedly, at a moment that makes no sense dramatically." [...] Tessa's death scene shows MacLeod kneeling next to Tessa and holding her corpse, then Richie reviving as an Immortal and speaking with MacLeod.|$|E
500|$|The {{workforce}} {{consisted of}} a mixture of German specialists and forcibly conscripted Frenchmen from the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO). They were supplemented by Belgian, Dutch, French, Polish, Czech and Soviet prisoners of war and civilian conscripts, who were used as slave labour. The labour force also included many French political prisoners and Spanish Republicans who had fled to France after General Franco's victory in the Spanish Civil War but had then been interned by the invading Germans. The non-German workers lived in two camps officially known as Organisation Todt Watten Zwangsarbeitslager 62 (Forced Labour Camp 62) about [...] distant from the site, {{near the village of}} Éperlecques. The camps were guarded by the French civil police with the assistance of Belgian and Dutch Nazis and Russian POWs who had volunteered for guard duty. Although escape attempts were punished by immediate execution, there were up to three escapes daily with external assistance. The commandant of the camp is said to have complained that it would have <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> [...] "guard a sack of fleas". Over 35,000 foreign workers passed through the camps during the period in which they were operational.|$|E

500|$|Like {{most other}} {{starling}}s, the hoopoe starling was omnivorous, feeding on fruits, seeds, and insects. Its tongue—long, slender, sharp, and frayed—may {{have been able}} to move rapidly, helpful when feeding on fruit, nectar, pollen, and invertebrates. Its pelvic elements were robust and its feet and claws large, indicating that it foraged near the ground. Its jaws were strong; Morioka compared its skull to that of the hoopoe, and it may have foraged in a similar way, probing and opening holes in substrate by inserting and opening its beak. De Montbeillard was informed of the stomach contents of a dissected specimen, consisting of seeds and the berries of [...] "Pseudobuxus" [...] (possibly Eugenia buxifolia, a bush with sweet, orange berries). He noted that the bird weighed , and was fatter around June and July. Several accounts suggest that the hoopoe starling migrated on Réunion, spending six months in the lowlands and six months in the mountains. Food may have <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> obtain in the lowlands during winter, with the birds breeding in the mountain forests during summer. The hoopoe starling probably nested in tree cavities. Its song was described as a [...] "bright and cheerful whistle" [...] and [...] "clear notes", indicating a similarity to the songs of other starlings.|$|E
500|$|Wainwright {{observed}} {{while driving}} {{in his car}} that [...] "it [...] be funny to redo this as a song cycle". Soon afterwards, he took the idea to New York-based theatrical producer Jared Geller (who would later co-produce the tribute concert with David Foster), hoping to turn a dream into a reality. Geller initially thought the idea was [...] "insane", but he and Wainwright continued discussing options. Eventually, Geller agreed {{to assist with the}} production and the two found space in Wainwright's schedule to book Carnegie Hall a year in advance. Once the venue was booked, staging elements such as lighting, microphone location and amplification were discussed. Stephen Oremus signed on as the conductor of the 36-piece orchestra and Phil Ramone took charge of the recording. Rehearsals began in April 2006, and while it would have <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> practice in rehearsal rooms, large theaters such as the Lynch at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Museum of Jewish Heritage were utilized because [...] "Rufus wanted a feel for performing this material on a stage". As a result of financial restrictions, full orchestra rehearsals took place only two days before the show and the day of each performance (practice with smaller groups of instruments began a few months before the concerts).|$|E
500|$|During {{a period}} of {{aggressive}} acquisition intended to establish the international prestige of Britain's collection, it was acquired for the National Gallery in 1860 in Milan from the Guicciardi family by Charles Lock Eastlake for just over £120, along {{with a number of}} other Netherlandish works. Eastlake's notes mention that the works were [...] "originally in the possession of the Foscari family". The Foscaris were a wealthy Venetian family which included Francesco Foscari who was Doge of Venice at the time the work was painted; the dramatic story of him and his son is told in Lord Byron's play The Two Foscari, and Verdi's opera I due Foscari. There is no documentary evidence to substantiate the claim that the painting came from the Foscari [...] collection, and some art historians believe that representatives of the Guicciardis invented this provenance to impress Eastlake. Lorne Campbell considers the provenance [...] "probable", noting that a descendant, Fergio Foscari (1732–1811), an ambassador to Saint Petersburg, squandered his fortune and may have been forced into selling pictures belonging to the family. Campbell speculates that the painting was produced on commission for export to Venice, noting that unrolled linen would have <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> transport than canvas, and that the row of holes just below the upper border could be explained if it had been stretched, mounted and framed by someone other than Bouts or a member of his workshop.|$|E
