5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with your best friend.|$|E
5|$|A pop ballad, the song's lyrics {{describe}} {{falling and}} <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>love.</b> The instrumentation includes piano, guitar, percussion, and strings.

25|$|Karol Wojtyła (later, Pope John Paul II) in {{his book}} Love and Responsibility {{postulated}} that monogamy, as an institutional union of two people <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with one another, was an embodiment of an ethical personalistic norm, and thus {{the only means of}} making true human love possible.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with The Irish Times, Hozier stated,I found the experience of falling in love or <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> was a death, a death of everything. You kind of watch yourself die in a wonderful way, and you experience for the briefest moment–if you see yourself for a moment through their eyes–everything you believed about yourself gone. In a death-and-rebirth sense.|$|E

One day, Dirk stops by the shop to apologize to Max and bring him a Christmas present. Dirk suggests Max see his old headmaster in the hospital, knowing Blume will be there.

25|$|In Milan, Proteus finds Valentine in {{love with}} the Duke's daughter, Silvia. Despite <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with Julia, Proteus falls {{instantly}} {{in love with}} Silvia and vows to win her. Unaware of Proteus' feelings, Valentine tells him the Duke wants Silvia to marry the foppish but wealthy Thurio, against her wishes. Because the Duke suspects that his daughter and Valentine are in love, he locks her nightly in a tower, to which he keeps the only key. However, Valentine tells Proteus that he plans to free her by means of a corded ladder, and together, they will elope. Proteus immediately informs the Duke, who subsequently captures and banishes Valentine.

Valentine lies, saying he was banished for killing a man in a fair fight, and the outlaws elect him their leader.|$|E

500|$|Published in {{an article}} for the Daily Mail {{discussing}} a rise in bi-curiosity amongst middle class teenage girls, an E4 spokeswoman said of Emily and Naomi's kiss: [...] "Skins is written by young people who don't see sexuality as defining who they are.

I was in love at the time, and (the song) sounds pretty happy, but it’s {{a little bit of a}} dark song. You’re so obsessed with somebody you start acting like a weirdo. … I write about falling in love, <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>love,</b> breaking up because he’s a loser, being heartbroken. I not only sing about getting rowdy, but love." ...|$|E

500|$|Cinyras' {{relationship}} with a girl on his daughter's age was therefore not unnatural, but Myrrha's <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with her own father was. Doll elaborates further on this stating that Myrrha's lamenting that animals can mate father and daughter without problems {{is a way for}} Ovid to express a paradox: in nature a father-daughter relationship is not unnatural, but it is in human society. On this Doll concludes that [...] "Nature follows no laws. There {{is no such thing as}} [...] "natural law"". Still, Ovid distances himself in three steps from the horrifying story: ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrical {{reference}} points in [...] are all quite interesting—if {{you consider the}} youth-obsessed reference collaborators {{of the first two}} singles and how uncomfortable it all feels. 'Superstar' offers a glimpse of something far more comfortable in its own skin. All the {{reference points}} will mean very little to your average 17-year-old. We suppose the idea is that they're icons whose imagery transcends generations blah blah blah but after all the aggressive positioning of the first two singles it's great to hear Madonna relaxing into this sort of song. The lyrics about <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> are a bit soppy but love makes you go a bit soppy sometimes.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Isaac Rentz. When shooting the music video, Jeremy Davis stated [...] "I've realized you can't really consider it making a music video unless you get hurt, because every video, we end up in pain ... It's awesome to do our own stunts; {{we might as well}} be Jackie Chan." [...] Taylor York adds [...] "A lot of people would hear the song and assume it would be about the story of people still <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>love,</b> but what was so appealing about Isaac's treatment is that he wanted to capture what love feels like ... He had so many ideas, and it definitely jumped out at us." ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{references}} drugs both metaphorically and literally, and innocently {{delivers a}} transgressive message {{through the use}} of simile: [...] "I'm going to do you like drugs tonight". Miguel said of the song's lyrics, [...] "I have this propensity to just come out and say things. That's how I am in real life. If I wanna know something I just ask. Like, 'Hey, do you like drugs?' Because I do! Sometimes! ... MDMA… on occasion." [...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian observes [...] "faded psychedelia" [...] and [...] "promises of narcotic [...] " [...] in the song's lyrics.

"Biko" [...] means [...] "Please" [...] (or more {{accurately}} [...] "I implore you") in Igbo—a language spoken in Nigeria, the homeland of Okereke's parents—and is used [...] "when you're beseeching {{someone to do}} something". Okereke denied that {{it is about the}} murdered South African anti-apartheid protester Steve Biko. The lyrics of [...] "One Month Off" [...] reference feelings of anger and are about <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with someone younger and unfaithful, while [...] "Zephyrus" [...] concerns an apology following neglect. The lyrics in the chorus of [...] "Ion Square", the last track on the original download release, are based on E. E. Cummings' poem [...] "I Carry Your Heart with Me". Okereke considers the song a personal favourite because it evokes the initial exciting stages of a new relationship when everything is going right.|$|E
500|$|... "Criminal" [...] is {{a guitar}} and synth-driven mid-tempo pop rock ballad which {{incorporates}} a folk-style flute melody. It {{is considered the}} only ballad on Femme Fatale, and is less aggressive than the other songs of the album. [...] "Criminal" [...] {{is influenced by the}} works of ABBA and Madonna.
