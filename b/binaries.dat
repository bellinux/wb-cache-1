5|$|Most {{stars are}} {{observed}} {{to be members}} of binary star systems, and the properties of those <b>binaries</b> are the result of the conditions in which they formed. A gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that angular momentum. The primordial <b>binaries</b> transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated (soft) <b>binaries</b> while causing hard <b>binaries</b> to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of <b>binaries</b> into their two observed populations distributions.|$|E
5|$|The post–main-sequence {{evolution}} of binary stars may be {{significantly different from}} the {{evolution of}} single stars of the same mass. If stars in a binary system are sufficiently close, when one of the stars expands to become a red giant it may overflow its Roche lobe, the region around a star where material is gravitationally bound to that star, leading to transfer of material to the other. When the Roche lobe is violated, a variety of phenomena can result, including contact <b>binaries,</b> common-envelope <b>binaries,</b> cataclysmic variables, and type Ia supernovae.|$|E
5|$|For contact or semi-detached <b>binaries,</b> the {{transfer}} of mass from a star to its companion can also result in a significant transfer of angular momentum. The accreting companion can spin {{up to the point}} where it reaches its critical rotation rate and begins losing mass along the equator.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} existance of <b>binary</b> pseudowavelets, bases on the <b>binary</b> domain that exhibit {{some of the}} {{properties}} of wavelets, such as multiresolution reconstruction and compact support. The <b>binary</b> pseudowavelets are defined on   n (<b>binary</b> vectors of length n) and are operated upon with the <b>binary</b> operators logical and and exclusive or. The forward transform, or analysis, is the decomposition of a <b>binary</b> vector into its constituant <b>binary</b> pseudowavelets. <b>Binary</b> pseudowavelets allow multiresolution, progressive reconstruction of <b>binary</b> vectors by using progressively more coefficients in the inverse transform. <b>Binary</b> pseudowavelets bases, being sparse matrices, also provide for fast transforms; moreover pseudowavelets rely on hardware-friendly operations for efficient software and hardware implementation...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>binary</b> {{clock is}} a clock that {{displays}} {{the time of}} day in a <b>binary</b> format. Originally, such clocks showed each decimal digit of sexagesimal time as a <b>binary</b> value, but presently <b>binary</b> clocks also exist which display hours, minutes, and seconds as <b>binary</b> numbers. Most <b>binary</b> clocks are digital, although analog varieties exist. True <b>binary</b> clocks also exist, which indicate the time by successively halving the day, instead of using hours, minutes, or seconds. Similar clocks, based on Gray coded <b>binary,</b> also exist.|$|R

Development {{was taken over}} by Yggdrasil, with the idea to turn Arena into an open source X Window System browser licensed under the GNU General Public License. Yggdrasil licensed an X emulator from Pearl Software to port Arena to Windows, although these builds were never released. Yggdrasil didn't provide any official <b>binaries</b> at this time, because they didn't want to expand the community with alpha-quality software. Although users would be able to run Arena by compiling it from the published source code, volunteers created unofficial finished <b>binaries.</b> Yggdrasil had planned to implement browsing features that were already standard in competitive web browsers, which resulted in the new bookmarks feature in version 0.3.18 on 7 April 1997.|$|E
5|$|Stars {{can also}} vary in {{luminosity}} because of extrinsic factors, such as eclipsing <b>binaries,</b> {{as well as}} rotating stars that produce extreme starspots. A notable example of an eclipsing binary is Algol, which regularly varies in magnitude from 2.3 to 3.5 {{over a period of}} 2.87 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} stages of core-collapse may be divided into three phases. During a globular cluster's adolescence, the process of core-collapse begins with stars near the core. However, the interactions between binary star systems prevents further collapse as the cluster approaches middle age. Finally, the central <b>binaries</b> are either disrupted or ejected, resulting in a tighter concentration at the core.|$|E
40|$|A {{family of}} m-ary linear {{feedback}} shift registers with <b>binary</b> logic is disclosed. Each m-ary linear feedback shift register with <b>binary</b> logic generates a <b>binary</b> {{representation of a}} nonbinary recurring sequence, producible with a m-ary linear feedback shift register without <b>binary</b> logic in which m is greater than 2. The state table of a m-ary linear feedback shift register without <b>binary</b> logic, utilizing sum modulo m feedback, is first tubulated for a given initial state. The entries in the state table are coded in <b>binary</b> and the <b>binary</b> entries are used to set the initial states of the stages of a plurality of <b>binary</b> shift registers. A single feedback logic unit is employed which provides a separate feedback <b>binary</b> digit to each <b>binary</b> register {{as a function of}} the states of corresponding stages of the <b>binary</b> registers...|$|R
40|$|Different {{strategies}} for <b>binary</b> analysis {{are widely used}} in systems dealing with software maintenance and system security. <b>Binary</b> code is self-contained; though {{it is easy to}} execute, {{it is not easy to}} read and understand. <b>Binary</b> analysis tools are useful in software maintenance because the <b>binary</b> of software has all the information necessary to recover the source code. It is also incredibly important and sensitive in the domain of security. Malicious <b>binary</b> code can infect other applications, hide in their <b>binary</b> code, contaminate the whole system or travel through Internet and attack other systems. This makes it imperative for security personnel to scan and analyze <b>binary</b> codes with the aid of the <b>binary</b> code analysis tools. On the other hand, crackers can reverse engineer the <b>binary</b> code to assembly code in order to break the secrets embedded in the <b>binary</b> code, such as registration number, password or secret algorithms. This motivates researches to prevent malicious monitoring by <b>binary</b> code analysis tools. Evidently, <b>binary</b> analysis tools play an important doublesided role in security. This paper surveys <b>binary</b> code analysis from the most fundamental perspective views: the <b>binary</b> code formats, several of the most basic analysis tools, such as disassembler, debugger and the instrumentation tools based on them. The previous research on <b>binary</b> analysis are investigated and summarized and a new approach of analysis, disasembler-based <b>binary</b> interpreter, is proposed and discussed. 1...|$|R

5|$|A 2008 {{study by}} John Fregeau of 13 {{globular}} clusters in the Milky Way shows {{that three of}} them have an unusually large number of X-ray sources, or X-ray <b>binaries,</b> suggesting the clusters are middle-aged. Previously, these globular clusters had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers. The implication is that most globular clusters, including the other ten studied by Fregeau, are not in middle age as previously thought, but are actually in 'adolescence'.|$|E
5|$|FreeBSD has a {{software}} repository of over 26,000 applications that are developed by third parties.

In general, the project {{itself does not}} develop this software, only the framework to allow these programs to be installed, which {{is known as the}} Ports collection. Applications may either be compiled from source ("ports"), provided their licensing terms allow this, or downloaded as pre-compiled <b>binaries</b> ("packages").

25|$|An eclipsing <b>binary</b> star is a <b>binary</b> star {{in which}} the orbit plane of the two stars lies so nearly {{in the line of}} sight of the {{observer}} that the components undergo mutual eclipses.

Algol is the best-known example of an eclipsing <b>binary.</b>|$|R
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} have a {{very high}} star density, and therefore close interactions and near-collisions of stars occur relatively often. Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of stars, such as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray <b>binaries,</b> are much more common in globular clusters. A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two stars, possibly {{as a result of an}} encounter with a binary system. The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the main sequence stars formed at the beginning of the cluster.|$|E
5|$|Iota Trianguli is {{a double}} star whose {{components}} can be separated by medium-sized telescopes into a strong yellow and a contrasting pale blue star. Both of these are themselves close <b>binaries.</b> X Trianguli is an eclipsing binary system that ranges between magnitudes 8.5 and 11.2 {{over a period of}} 0.97 days. RW Trianguli is a cataclysmic variable star system composed of a white dwarf primary and an orange main sequence star of spectral type K7 V. The former is drawing off matter from the latter, forming a prominent accretion disc. The system is around 1075 light-years distant.|$|E

No firm {{evidence}} {{of the presence of}} water, or any other specific compound on their surface has been obtained, but it is thought that they are coated in tholins, organic polymers formed by the Sun's radiation. The Jupiter trojans' densities (as measured by studying <b>binaries</b> or rotational lightcurves) vary from 0.8 to 2.5g·cm−3.

5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{heating effect}} of binary star systems works {{to prevent an}} initial core collapse of the cluster. When a star passes near a binary system, the orbit of the latter pair tends to contract, releasing energy. Only after the primordial supply of <b>binaries</b> is exhausted due to interactions can a deeper core collapse proceed. In contrast, the effect of tidal shocks as a globular cluster repeatedly passes through the plane of a spiral galaxy tends to significantly accelerate core collapse.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} {{of stars in}} the collapsed core region causes tight binary systems to form. As other stars interact with these tight <b>binaries,</b> they increase the energy at the core, which causes the cluster to re-expand.

5|$|A {{claim was}} made on 17 January 2006, by now former {{developer}} Hartmut Birr on the ReactOS developers mailing list (ros-dev) that ReactOS contained code derived from disassembling Microsoft Windows. The code that Birr disputed involved the function BadStack in syscall.S. {{as well as other}} unspecified items. Comparing this function to disassembled <b>binaries</b> from Windows XP, Birr argued that the BadStack function was simply copy-pasted from Windows XP, given that they were identical. Alex Ionescu, the author of the code, asserted that while the Windows XP binary in question was indeed disassembled and studied, the code was not merely copy-pasted, but reimplemented; the reason why the functions were identical, Ionescu claimed, was because there was only one possible way to implement the function.|$|E
5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that <b>binaries</b> can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
