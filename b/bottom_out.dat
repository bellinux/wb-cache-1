5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, the 1995 season started on April 25, and was shortened to 144 games instead of the normal 162. California took an early lead in the AL West standings and traded first place with Texas through May and June. They took the lead on July 2, and held on to that lead throughout the rest of July and all of August. Seattle, meanwhile, spent most of June through August in third or fourth place. They would <b>bottom</b> <b>out</b> on August 2, 13 games out of first place.|$|E
5|$|While the {{fortunes}} of the franchise had been declining for a few years, they would <b>bottom</b> <b>out</b> with a player exodus following the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The squad's entire All Black front row of Carl Hayman, Anton Oliver, and Clarke Dermody left for lucrative contracts in Europe, while star first-five Nick Evans moved north to Auckland to play for the Blues, and hugely talented young lock James Ryan was forced to retire at age 24 due to injury problems. Joining the exodus were several other veteran starters, along with coach Greg Cooper who left the franchise to take up an assistant coaching position with the Blues. The coach for the 2008 season, Glenn Moore, was appointed 28 August 2007.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, {{the future}} of the city seemed grim. Before the war (in 1850), the {{population}} had reached 3,824 to become the 3rd largest city in the state (behind Mobile and Montgomery). By 1870 it returned 1,137 residents (with Black residents outnumbering Whites by a margin of 594 to 543); in 1880, 816 residents; by 1890, it had declined to 619, and would <b>bottom</b> <b>out</b> at 562 in 1900. Not until 1950 would it return to having the same population as a century earlier (with 3,813 residents).|$|E

40|$|The impact {{properties}} of six foam materials used for energy absorption as the liner of children’s helmets, reported by Gimbel and Hoshizaki are considered further. In high-energy impacts, almost complete compression {{of the energy}} absorbing material (<b>bottoming</b> <b>out)</b> may occur, and {{the severity of the}} impact increases greatly. Too soft a material means <b>bottoming</b> <b>out</b> occurs at low speeds, but if it is too stiff, the material itself is injurious. The fitting of equations to results in‘no bottoming out’ and ‘bottoming out’ conditions may help assessment of what compromise is appropriate. The equations in this article correspond to peak acceleration being proportional to power functions of impactor speed and mass. 1. When there was no <b>bottoming</b> <b>out,</b> peak acceleration was found to be proportional to mˆ(c- 1). vˆ(2 c), with c being approximately 0. 25. 2. For <b>bottoming</b> <b>out,</b> peak acceleration was found to be proportional to mˆ(p). vˆ(q), with p and q being approximately 2 and approximately 3. 3. The constants of proportionality were related to material density in a regular way. Timothy Paul Hutchinso...|$|R

25|$|The White Star Line and Cunard Line merged in 1934, {{without having}} an impact on the career of the ship. The ship was docked in December 1935 and served the {{following}} September as troop transport bound for Palestine. In this capacity, she made her last trip for the White Star Line in December of that year. In 1937 she took part in the Coronation Naval Review at Spithead carrying government guests. In 1939, with the start of the Second World War, Laurentic was requisitioned as HMS Laurentic and converted into an auxiliary cruiser, losing her recasting part of the superstructure aft. On 3 November 1940, the Laurentic was called for help from a ship torpedoed by a U-boat. Arriving at the scene, she was torpedoed twice by U-99 commanded by Otto Kretschmer, but the torpedoes missed their target. Laurentic answers, but after four hours of fighting, she was struck by two torpedoes which sent her to the <b>bottom.</b> <b>Out</b> of the 416 people on board, 49 died. She was the last White Star vessel to sink and one of the final four White Star vessels along with Georgic, Britannic and Nomadic.|$|E
25|$|On 16 January 1944, U-66 left Lorient {{for what}} would be her last patrol and the last command of Oberleutnant zur See Gerhard Seehausen (posthumously {{promoted}} to Kapitänleutnant). A month and ten days after departure, U-66 sighted Silvermaple, a 5,313-ton British motor merchant in the convoy ST-12. She was sunk after one torpedo hit. Four days later, the boat came upon the French 5,202-ton St. Louis, which she sank with two torpedoes off Accra, Ghana. The ship broke into three parts, which sank in less than 50 seconds. Four days after the sinking of St. Louis, 'U-66 sank the 4,964-ton British John Holt with two torpedoes, and took the captain, Master Cecil Gordon Hime, and a passenger, Mr Elliott - {{an agent of the}} Holt Shipping Company, prisoner. These men were later lost with the U-boat. Nearly three weeks after the sinking of John Holt, the U-boat came across the 4,257-ton British Matadian, which she torpedoed and sank. After the attack, U-66 was forced to <b>bottom</b> <b>out</b> in the mud as British patrol craft engaged her. U-66 was supposed to be resupplied by , but this boat, a Milchkuh supply submarine, was sunk on 26 April.|$|E

25|$|The Mud Island Fort was {{designed}} and begun by British engineer Captain John Montresor in 1771. The river front was shielded by a stone face, but then the work stopped due to a shortage of money. After the outbreak of war with Britain, {{the rest of the}} fort's defenses were completed with wooden palisades and earthen ramparts, despite the infighting among the French engineer officers. There were wooden barracks for the enlisted men along the west and north sides of the fort. Nearby was a two-story building to accommodate officers. According to one of the defending soldiers, a battery of 18-pound artillery pieces stood at the southeast end of Mud Island. On the southwest end, one 32-pound and four or five 12-pound and 18-pound cannons guarded the river. Three 12-pound guns covered the northwest end of the island. Another account states that ten 18-pound guns made up the main battery while each of the four blockhouses contained four cannons. A bristling set of sharpened logs surrounded the fort while the low ground along the shoreline was infested with trous-de-loups or wolf holes. Chevaux de frise prevented the British navy from ascending the Delaware. Their iron tipped stakes threatened to tear the <b>bottom</b> <b>out</b> of any ship whose master was reckless enough to make the attempt.|$|E
500|$|After the game, Gary Anderson was {{described}} as [...] "inconsolable." [...] Although the Vikings still led by seven points at the time, his missed kick had a demoralizing effect on the team.

[...] Writing for the website Sporting News, Jeff Diamond, the Vikings' general manager in 1998, observed that, [...] "Our team played {{the rest of the}} game as if it was in shock that our automatic kicker had missed at the most critical time."

500|$|About {{three hours}} after the collision, a large wave dropped Otranto onto [...] "Old Women's Reef", about three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) offshore, near the {{entrance}} to Machir Bay, missing a sandy beach just north of the reef. The action of the enormous waves quickly broke the ship in half and then ripped her <b>bottom</b> <b>out.</b> Of the roughly 489 men aboard after Mounsey departed, only 21 (17 of these were American) were able to successfully swim ashore, although 2 of these, including 1 American, later died of their injuries. The islanders were able to rescue some of these men by pulling them up the coastal cliffs or from rocks just offshore. By the following morning, the liner had been completely demolished by the heavy seas and the coastline was strewn with wreckage and hundreds of bodies in piles up to [...] deep. A total of 316 Americans were found and buried on Islay and the nearby island of Muck.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to test three {{flexible}} polyurethane foams for mattress for comfort and durability. In particular, they were investigated the effects of foam composition and cell architecture on some physical-mechanical properties of interest for bedding applications and related to foam comfort levels (i. e. surface firmness, hysteresis loss and resistance to <b>bottoming</b> <b>out),</b> and their changes after artificial weathering due to moisture and temperature. The results demonstrated that all the three foams have open cell morphology and similar cell structure, with average cell diameters ranging from 430 to 510 micron and wide cell size distribution. As a consequence, they also show comparable water vapor transport behavior. On the contrary, their mechanical response, in terms of hysteresis loss, surface firmness and resistance to <b>bottoming</b> <b>out,</b> was found strongly dependent on their chemical structure and molecular mobility, as inferred from infrared spectroscopy analysis. During accelerated weathering all the foams undergo oxidations that affected their comfort factors in static conditions, giving a progressive lowering of hysteresis loss, surface firmness and resistance to <b>bottoming</b> <b>out,</b> particularly for the two foams having lower crosslinking level and thus slow recovery rate after compression...|$|R

40|$|Japan and the United States have {{experienced}} the housing bubbles and subsequent collapses of the bubbles in succession. In this paper, these two bubbles are compared and the following findings are obtained. Firstly, upon applying twenty years of past data from Japan to the “repeat-sales method ” and the “hedonic pricing method”, which are representative methods for calculating house prices, {{it was found that}} the timing at which prices bottomed out after the collapses of the bubbles differed depending on the two methods. The timing for <b>bottoming</b> <b>out</b> as estimated by the repeat-sales method delayed when compared to the estimate using the hedonic pricing method, by 13 months for condominiums and by three months for single-family homes. This delay is caused by the depreciation effect of building not being processed appropriately by the repeat-sales method. In the United States, the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices are representative house prices indices, which use the repeat-sales method. Therefore, it is possible that the timing for <b>bottoming</b> <b>out</b> is estimated to be delayed. As there are increasing interests in the timing for <b>bottoming</b> <b>out</b> of the US housing market, there is a risk that the existence of such a lag in cognition causes the increase of uncertainty and the delay in economic recovery...|$|R
