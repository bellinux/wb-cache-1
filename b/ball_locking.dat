50|$|A 5x5 grid sits {{in front}} of Pin Bot's visor, and two banks of targets on the top and side of the grid allow the player to light the grid one or two units at a time. Once the grid is fully lit, the visor opens, {{allowing}} the player to lock the <b>ball.</b> <b>Locking</b> a second ball in the visor starts a two-ball multiball mode, during which scores are doubled. The player can then re-lock one of the balls and shoot the other up the Solar Ramp, collecting a bonus score.|$|E

5000|$|This game {{featured}} new {{speech by}} Penelope Ann Miller (Margo Lane), John Lone (Shiwan Khan), and Tim Curry (Farley Claymore) (reprising their respective roles), {{as well as}} speech from the movie. The Shadow's speech for this game was provided by Williams/Midway voice actor, Tim Kitzrow. The game's noted features include player-controlled ball diverters {{on the left and}} right ramps, a magnetic <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> (which freezes the ball and pulls the ball inside the <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> for Shadow Multiball), and a Breakout-style upper playfield, called [...] "The Battlefield".|$|R
5000|$|Multiball: To start multiball, {{light the}} <b>lock</b> <b>ball</b> shot by hitting the [...] "Lite" [...] and [...] "Lock" [...] targets and then {{successfully}} shooting {{the ball in}} the <b>ball</b> <b>lock,</b> also called the [...] "No Way Out" [...] Hazard; doing this 3 times will start multiball.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> is an {{ordinary}} padlock fastened around the male scrotum, separating the testicles {{away from the}} penis and not removable except by key or combination.|$|R
50|$|The {{game has}} 3-ball multiball where each ball is {{launched}} through three separate 'Lift-Off' stages. This is {{placed at the}} upper left of the playfield inside a maze-like <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Additionally three lights labeled U, S and A are lit when a ball {{rolls over}} them. They are worth 2,000 points each. Spelling USA {{increases}} {{the end of}} ball bonus multiplier (a multiplication factor for points earned and awarded when {{the ball in play}} drains). There are three pop bumpers that are worth 100 points when unlit and 1,000 points when lit. Two or three ball multiball is started by hitting one ball up a <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> or two <b>balls</b> up two different <b>ball</b> <b>locks</b> and then shooting a ball up the center ramp when the drop target is down.|$|R
25|$|Ball lock: Each time a ball {{goes into}} a {{specific}} hole or target, it is locked, and a new ball appears at the plunger. When the player has locked the required number of balls (often three), the multiball feature starts. On some games, the <b>balls</b> are physically <b>locked</b> in place by solenoid-actuated gates, but many newer machines use virtual <b>ball</b> <b>locks</b> instead, in which the game merely keeps count {{of the number of}} <b>locked</b> <b>balls</b> and then auto-launches them from the main ball trough when it is time for them to be released.|$|R
5000|$|The quick-connector {{fittings}} {{which allow}} hoses {{to be easily}} attached and removed from the ports come in two mechanical varieties, namely pin <b>lock</b> and <b>ball</b> <b>lock,</b> which are not interchangeable. Historically, pin lock kegs were used primarily by the Coca-Cola company, while <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> kegs were used primarily by Pepsi. On a pin lock keg, there are metal posts (pins) extending horizontally from around the port. When the connector is attached, these pins hold it in place. The [...] "gas in" [...] port has two pins, while the [...] "liquid out" [...] has three, {{making it impossible to}} accidentally switch the gas-versus-liquid hoses (which would harmlessly result in carbon dioxide bubbling up through the drink, while gas but no drink would be dispensed). <b>Ball</b> <b>lock</b> kegs have ridges in the ports, which are gripped by small metal balls in the connectors. Both types of kegs are fairly easy to find, though ball-lock seem to be more common.As a result of demand from home brewers, second hand kegs are becoming progressively more scarce and in recent years brand new kegs have come onto the market, manufactured in China to the same specifications.|$|R
40|$|The design, development, {{and testing}} of a release {{mechanism}} for use in two life science experiments on the Spacelab 1, 4, and D 1 missions is described. The mechanism is a self latching <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> device actuated by a linear solenoid. An unusual feature is the tapering of the <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> plunger {{to give it a}} near constant breakout force for release under a wide range of loads. The selection of the design, based on the design requirements, is discussed. A number of problems occurred during development and test, including problems caused by human factors that became apparent after initial delivery for crewtraining sessions. These problems and their solutions are described to assist in the design {{and testing of}} similar mechanisms...|$|R

50|$|It is not {{recommended}} that kegs be sanitized with bleach. To avoid unpleasant residuals, sanitize kegs with an iodine or oxygen based sanitizer. Sanitizers like Star-San and B-Brite are commonly used. The <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> valves may be unscrewed using wrenches to allow further cleaning or replacement of O-rings or poppet valves.|$|R

Completing the C-O-F-F-I-N letters collects a 2 MILLION point jackpot. The playfield contains elements such as for example pop-bumpers, stationary targets, drop-targets, rollovers, ramps, saucer holes and spinners.|$|R
50|$|A Lolo Ball, {{also known}} as a Pogo Ball, Springbal, Lolobal, Disc-O or Pogobal, is a toy.

5000|$|Whirlwind is {{distinguished}} by three playfield rotating discs, and a fan topper that blows wind on the player {{at certain times}} in the game. The objective in Whirlwind is to move the storm using the compass targets to light <b>ball</b> <b>locks</b> for multiball. In multiball, a progressive jackpot can be scored by making left ramp shots from the upper right flipper. Alternatively, one can work towards the [...] "Wizard Mode" [...] by lighting and collecting all of the seven [...] "Super Cellar Door" [...] values.|$|R
50|$|The left eject is lit for 25,000 at {{start of}} game.

5000|$|All hits of {{the upper}} playfield pop bumpers {{increase}} the base [...] "Borg Jackpot" [...] amount awarded in Borg Multiball mode. To start the mode, and thus the battle with the Borg ship, the player needs to <b>lock</b> three <b>balls.</b> <b>Locks</b> are lit by shooting the right orbit (or selecting [...] "Light Lock" [...] on {{the start of a}} ball). Then shoot the right orbit again (or — if either or both are lit — the Delta Quadrant ramp or the Neutral Zone) to <b>lock</b> a <b>ball.</b> After <b>locking</b> the third <b>ball,</b> Multiball will start with one ball placed into the left cannon and the [...] "Start Mission" [...] hole lit. Shooting the hole damages the Borg Ship and scores the Jackpot. A second hit will score a Double Jackpot, and a third hit destroys the Borg ship and scores the Triple Jackpot. In addition, each cannon shot in the [...] "Start Mission" [...] hole adds 10 million points to the Jackpot. After a Triple Jackpot, levels reset to Single Jackpot, allowing for multiple Triple Jackpots.|$|R

30|$|Calipers are the {{orthotic}} devices used in SCI {{cases with}} injury at T 6 –T 9. The classification of calipers {{has been mentioned}} in Fig.  9. They are fitted to the lower limb of SCI patients {{with the help of}} metal rods. KAFO is a type of orthotic device which stabilizes knee, ankle and foot, where the knee is supported by a caliper. In some cases, the joint is locked using a drop lock, spring loaded <b>lock,</b> cam <b>lock,</b> <b>ball</b> <b>lock,</b> dial lock or a plunger type of lock. The KAFOs are mainly used to support the patients with muscle weakness, upper motor neuron lesions and lost structural integrity [40]. However, combination of KAFO and a Shannon’s brace provides better support. Shannon’s brace is used separately or combined with KAFO to provide waist support, once the patient shows improvement. It helps the patients in restoring his functional abilities. In context to locomotion, it helps a patient to become independent of supportive/mobility aids.|$|R
50|$|Other notable {{features}} of Black Knight are a loud riding bell {{instead of the}} old familiar knock when a special (free game) was won, three ball multi-ball that did not require any previous targets to be hit before allowing <b>balls</b> to <b>lock,</b> and random score targets.|$|R
25|$|Recently, an exact-scale HO {{model of}} the AAR coupler has been {{designed}} and manufactured by Frank Sergent.
