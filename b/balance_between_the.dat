This <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> time-biased medium of speech and the space-biased medium of writing was {{eventually}} upset, Innis argued, as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing. The torch of empire then passed from Greece to Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuous}} warfare had {{a serious}} effect upon Manuel's vitality; he declined in health and in 1180 succumbed to a slow fever. Furthermore, like Manzikert, the <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two powers began to gradually shift – Manuel never again attacked the Turks, and after his death they began to move further west, deeper into Byzantine territory.|$|E
5|$|The new {{commissioner}} {{spent the}} second half of 1906 attending ICC hearings around the country. The Hepburn Act had given the Commission broad powers over the railroads, and the Commission worked to deal not only with past railroad abuses, but to strike a <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> desires of railroads and those of shippers.|$|E

5|$|Coon {{assumed the}} role of {{superintendent}} of shops in 1896. During his tenure at Georgia Tech, he moved the curriculum away from vocational training. Coon emphasized a <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> shop and the classroom. Coon taught his students more modern quantification methods to solve engineering problems instead of outdated and more costly trial and error methods. He also {{played a significant role in}} developing mechanical engineering into a professional degree program, with a focus on ethics, design and testing, analysis and problem solving, and mathematics.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, unbearably {{inadequate}} {{housing and}} overcrowded neighborhoods pushed working {{men out of}} the home and into saloons where they congregated for drink and discussion. Wealthy capitalists wishing to strike a <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> demands of labor and desires of capital looked to Robert Owen's example. George Pullman and William Halliday implemented a policy of tolerance in their towns identical to that of Robert Owen. The peaceful atmosphere in Pullman and Hallidayboro can be attributed in part to the absence of alcohol.|$|E

Reviewers praised Edward as a <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> typical clever kid and the stubborn kid persona. Additionally, his comedic moments have been celebrated as some of the best moments in the series. His Japanese and English voice actors, Romi Park and Vic Mignogna, have both been praised for their performances as Edward Elric and have won several awards for their work. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released bearing Edward's likeness, including key chains and action figures.|$|E
5|$|The common council {{consists}} of 10 members, six {{of whom are}} elected from single-member districts. The other four, including its president, are elected at-large. The council has eight standing committees for issues including transportation, education, finance and public safety.

5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E
5|$|A third recension was {{probably}} compiled {{during the reign}} of HenryI and was used at the coronation of his successor, Stephen, in 1135. While retaining the most important elements of the Anglo-Saxon rite, it borrowed heavily from the consecration of the Holy Roman Emperor from the Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a book of German liturgy compiled in Mainz in 961, thus bringing the English tradition into line with continental practice. It remained in use until the coronation of EdwardII in 1308 when the fourth recension was first used, having been compiled over several preceding decades. Although influenced by its French counterpart, the new ordo focussed on the <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> monarch and his nobles and on the oath, neither of which concerned the absolutist French kings. One manuscript of this recension is the Liber Regalis at Westminster Abbey which has come to be regarded as the definitive version.|$|E
5|$|According to an IAU draft resolution, the {{roundness}} condition generally {{results in}} {{the need for a}} mass of at least 5 kg, or diameter of at least 800km. However, Mike Brown claims that these numbers are only right for rocky bodies like asteroids, and that icy bodies like Kuiper Belt objects reach hydrostatic equilibrium at much smaller sizes, probably somewhere between 200 and 400km in diameter. It all depends on the rigidity of the material that makes up the body, which is in turn strongly influenced by its internal temperature. Assuming that Methone's shape reflects the <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> tidal force exerted by Saturn and the moon's gravity, its tiny 3km diameter suggests Methone is composed of icy fluff.|$|E

5|$|As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times {{that she did}} not want to be like either of her parents: her father had {{followed}} her mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is frequently conflicted trying to <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two, and fears her family are hindering her medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming like her mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E
5|$|Deciduous {{trees and}} {{plants have been}} {{promoted}} {{as a means of}} controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain.|$|E
5|$|Following {{majority}} rule in early 1980, British Army trainers oversaw {{the integration of}} guerrilla fighters into a battalion structure overlaid on the existing Rhodesian armed forces. For the first year, a system was followed where the top-performing candidate became battalion commander. If {{he or she was}} from ZANLA, then his or her second-in-command was the top-performing ZIPRA candidate, and vice versa. This ensured a <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two movements in the command structure. From early 1981, this system was abandoned in favour of political appointments, and ZANLA and ZANU fighters consequently quickly formed the majority of battalion commanders in the ZNA.|$|E

As a result, Nguyễn Ánh and a few loyalists fled into the dense jungles of the Mekong Delta in the far south. Later, Nguyễn Ánh made Duyệt a Cai Cơ ("Commander") of his bodyguards. From 1777 onwards, the military <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Tây Sơn and the Nguyễn fluctuated, as the enemies counterattacked each other frequently.|$|E
5|$|Limousins {{generally}} have {{lower levels of}} intra-muscular fat (marbling) and subcutaneous fat when compared with British breed cattle grown in similar conditions. Marbling, together with tenderness and flavour, {{has been associated with}} eating quality in some countries, and attracts a higher quality grading with associated premiums, although the link between marbling and palatability is not universally supported. In some countries, Limousin's lean, tender meat is considered to be of outstanding quality and marketed through specialist outlets. Beef producers targeting the higher marbling specifications of some markets, but who have concerns over the poorer feed conversion efficiency and yield associated with higher marbling British breed cattle, use Limousin sires over British breed cows, or British breed sires over Limousin cows, in crossbreeding programmes that aim to achieve a <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> different and conflicting production demands.|$|E
