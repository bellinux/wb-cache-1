25|$|G. aurea is a {{perennial}} herb that forms small, compact rosettes composed of nearly linear leaves about 2mm wide. Leaves are typically 5–50mm in length, {{but most of}} that length, including the petiole, is hidden beneath the soil. The rosettes can grow to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> as 5cm wide. It has no true roots and instead has highly modified subterranean leaves that act as the carnivorous trapping mechanism.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century, the bay {{was subject}} to the Reber Plan, which would have filled {{in parts of the}} bay in order to {{increase}} industrial activity along the waterfront. In 1959, the United States Army Corps of Engineers released a report stating that if current infill trends continued, the bay would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> as a shipping channel by 2020. This news created the Save the Bay movement in 1960, which mobilized to stop the infill of wetlands and the bay in general, which had shrunk to two-thirds of its size in the century before 1961.|$|E
25|$|Forwards tend to run {{straight}} and {{hard at the}} opposition, while the backs run at gaps between players or use speed and guile to run around them. In modern games of rugby some backs can <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> as forwards and attempt {{to break through the}} defensive line using brute force and many forwards possess the running skills of backs. Players run straight at the opposition with the aim of either breaking the tackle or getting forward momentum from which to set up another attack. If they are close to the try line they can drive in low to aid grounding the ball. Players can also try to break through tackles by spinning after making contact or by using the hand not carrying the ball to fend (push) off the defender.|$|E

25|$|Middlesex Crusaders amassed 333 for 4 in 45 overs - that's {{nearly seven}} and a half runs an over, well over the average five in 45-over games - and still lost to Gloucestershire Gladiators. It didn't look as the score would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> at first,as Paul Weekes with 81, Ed Smith with 53, Owais Shah with 55 and Scott Styris with 42 kept the score ticking at roughly a run a ball. However, Kenyan-born Jamie Dalrymple slashed four sixes and seven fours in an unbeaten 24-ball 60 to up the run rate late on, and Gloucestershire's Jon Lewis, who earlier in the summer had played ODIs for England, conceded 86 runs in nine overs. Gloucestershire always kept up with the run rate, however, as Phil Weston, Craig Spearman and Matt Windows lifted Gloucestershire to 275 for 2, and despite Paul Weekes' late burst of four wickets, Mark Alleyne and Ian Fisher shared a stand of 18 to see Gloucestershire to the target.|$|E
500|$|... "Breaking Point" [...] premiered on August 18, 2010, on {{the urban}} radio station V-103 in Atlanta. It was {{selected}} as the album's lead single to showcase Hilson sans featured acts. In an interview, Hilson elaborated on the decision: [...] "Timbaland and Polow [...] knew that even though I've been known for club records, guest features and collaborations, I am a true R lover ... for many reasons ... We knew it wouldn't grow as fast or even <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> a record as some of my past ... We wanted to showcase me by myself, feature-less, and we wanted to reveal that I can sing, and really connect with my music and my message. We felt that was the best introduction to No Boys Allowed." [...] Mosley Music Group and Interscope Records released the single via digital distribution in the United States on September 7, 2010. It was later sent to urban adult contemporary radio on October 25, 2010, while the album's second single, [...] "Pretty Girl Rock", was classified for contemporary hit radio the same week.|$|E
500|$|For the {{character}} of Giselle, her journey to becoming a real woman is reflected in her dresses, which become less fairy tale-like as the film progresses. Her wedding dress {{at the beginning of}} the film directly contrasts her modern gown at the end of the film. The wedding dress served to provide a [...] "humongous contrast to the flat drawings" [...] and to accentuate the image of a Disney Princess. In order to make the waist look small, the sleeves are designed to be [...] "extremely pouffy" [...] and the skirt to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> as possible, which included a metal hoop that holds up 20 layers of petticoats and ruffles. Altogether, eleven versions of the dress are made for filming, each made of 200 yards (183 m) of silk satin and other fabric, and weighing approximately 40 pounds (18kg). On the experience of wearing the wedding dress, Amy Adams described it as [...] "grueling" [...] since [...] "the entire weight was on her hips, so occasionally it felt like she was in traction".|$|E

500|$|Congress had by the Act of March 3, 1863 {{authorized}} fractional {{currency in}} the denomination of 3 cents; when these notes reached circulation {{the following year}} they proved wildly unpopular. The 1864 law which had substituted bronze for copper-nickel had also outlawed [...] "copperheads" [...] or private token issues. Even though these could now only be issued anonymously, and so could not be redeemed, the copperheads were preferred to the 3-cent shinplasters. [...] Some copperhead tokens even read [...] "Substitute for shinplasters". The notes soon became filthy and ragged, making them even more disliked. They were more difficult to value in quantity than notes with denominations divisible by five. According to Walter Breen, [...] "This was the moment Wharton's supporters had been waiting for." [...] Wharton and his advocates argued that the three-cent notes should be redeemed with equivalent coins. They contended that were Congress to order a three-cent bronze coin, such a piece would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> as an obsolete large cent, and {{might be used to}} deceive the blind into accepting the pre-1857 cent rather than the more valuable coin. Pollock, previously an opponent of nickel coinage, {{had a change of heart}} and became a supporter.|$|E
500|$|Jam and Lewis {{were the}} primary instrumentalists for the recording, {{including}} percussion, piano, drums, and also provided background vocals. Jackson accompanied Jam and Lewis on keyboard and took part in composing the arrangements. Stephen Holden of The New York Times observed the album was prominent example of the developing relationship with musicians and modern technology, stating [...] "...technology has altered the form, shape, scale and even the meaning of popular music... The album wasn't created by a studio band, as were most pop-rock albums in the 1960s and '70s, but by the producers and the singer programming mechanized drum and keyboard textures." [...] Jackson's father disapproved of the new material and image of Control, claiming it would never sell. In a cover story for Spin magazine titled [...] "Damn It, Janet: The Battle for Control of Janet Jackson," [...] Joseph was reported saying [...] "f Janet listens to me, she'll <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> as Michael." [...] She and McClain disregarded his objections. Commenting on the final product, Jackson stated: [...] "It's aggressive, cocky, very forward. It expresses exactly who I am and how I feel.

Scott of At The Movies also {{compared}} his {{viewing of}} the film to {{the first time he}} viewed Star Wars and he said [...] "although the script is a little bit... obvious," [...] it was [...] "part of what made it work". Todd McCarthy of Variety praised the film, saying [...] "The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in Avatar, and it's very much a place worth visiting." [...] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review. [...] "The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups you care to mention," [...] he stated. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded Avatar a three-and-a-half out of four star rating and wrote in his print review [...] "It extends the possibilities of what movies can do. Cameron's talent may just <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> as his dreams." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine thought that the film was [...] "the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times thought the film has [...] "powerful" [...] visual accomplishments but [...] "flat dialogue" [...] and [...] "obvious characterization". James Berardinelli of ReelViews praised the film and its story, giving it four out of four stars; he wrote [...] "In 3-D, it's immersive– but the traditional film elements– story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc.– are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2-D version an engrossing 2½-hour experience." ...|$|E

Nearer to the album's release, Carl Begai reviewed the entire album for BW, saying that, [...] "the battle over the Queensrÿche name should end here with this album", because: Queensrÿche is [...] "a record with truckloads of potential to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> of a deal as Empire was when the title track exploded all over civilization in the '90s.
