50|$|<b>Blackplate</b> {{is made of}} untinned iron or {{steel and}} is {{annealed}} on open flames or in an annealing box. Its dark appearance is caused by its reaction with the surrounding air. During warm rolling, <b>blackplate</b> can be manufactured to thicknesses of 1.5 mm or more. Cold rolled <b>blackplate,</b> by contrast, can be made thinner - thicknesses of 0.4 to 1.5 mm being attainable - and produces better surface qualities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blackplate</b> is {{hot rolled}} or cold rolled, non-descaled sheet steel or sheet iron.|$|E
50|$|The old {{traditions of}} making <b>blackplate</b> and {{tinplate}} {{as well as}} ironware manufacturing are still honoured in Bernsbach today.|$|E
40|$|Delivery of the 3 rd and 4 th Dees and Ring Flanges of the CMS-ECAL endcaps to CERN. The {{pictures}} show also an endcap crystal {{with its}} VPT (Vacuum PhotoTriode), the aluminium <b>blackplates</b> of the endcap Dees and four mock supercrystals (5 x 5 crystals) attached in {{their position on}} the backplate, along with 138 positional spacers. Finally, endcap assembly in the CMS construction hall in Cessy (neighbouring France) is also shown...|$|R
5000|$|From about 1740, in {{addition}} to the furnace and forge, there was a rolling mill further downstream, which produced <b>blackplate,</b> which was sent to a tinmill at Mitton (now in Stourport) to be made into tinplate. The name of a nearby wood suggests that tinplate may have been produced at Bringewood. However, this can only have been after period of the Knights' occupation of the works, as the surviving accounts (for 1733-78) show only <b>blackplate</b> being produced.|$|E
5000|$|Bringewood Ironworks was a {{charcoal}} ironworks in north Herefordshire. It was {{powered by the}} river Teme, with a blast furnace, a finery forge and latterly a rolling mill for <b>blackplate</b> (to be tinned into tinplate).|$|E
50|$|Wood (for charcoal) {{came from}} the nearby chases of Bringewood, Mocktree and Darvel. Though the {{possibility}} of mining locally is mentioned in some leases, {{it is probable that}} the main source of ore was Titterstone Clee Hill. Pig iron, bar iron and <b>blackplate,</b> made in the works were carried by land to Bewdley for sale, so far as not sold locally. Bringewood bar iron enjoyed a high reputation as being tough.|$|E
5000|$|Major John Hanbury (1664-1734) {{acquired}} {{a reputation as}} an industrial pioneer and through the endeavours of Hanbury and his leading agents, Thomas Cooke, William Payne and Thomas Allgood, significant developments within the British tinplate industry were made in Pontypool, including {{the introduction of the}} world’s first rolling for the production of iron sheets and <b>blackplate</b> at the Pontypool Park works in 1697. Tinplate was being produced at Pontypool from c. 1706, with an important tin mill in operation at Pontymoile during the early eighteenth century.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{companies}} now offer hand-painted finishes for metalwork, {{as well as}} a more permanent look that can be achieved with powder-coated finishes. For {{the low end of the}} market, imitation panels are pressed from plastic or aluminum. Tin is now fashionably used for art work, back splashes, cabinet faces, wainscoting and much more. For over 100 years the tin panel was made with nail rails around the outside of the panel, designed to overlap each other. Panels were nailed into wood furring strips which were prevalent prior to the invention of plywood. Today, nail up panels can be easily brad nailed or hand nailed, into plywood without the need for the original 1 x 2 in furring strips. There is also a patented interlocking tin panel that will screw directly into existing drywall/popcorn/plaster ceilings, without the need for extensive plywood installation. Tin panels today are made in 24 x 24 in and 24 x 48 in sizes for easier handling and one-person installation. Today, most tin ceiling manufacturers actually use recycled <b>blackplate</b> steel in a thickness of only [...]010 or 1/100th of an inch. There are some manufacturers who also use actual tin plated steel, which is simply the <b>blackplate</b> steel with a thin coating of bright tin plate adhered to the base metal. Other manufacturers utilize aluminum, as it is rustproof and will last a lifetime.|$|E
50|$|What is {{described}} {{here is the}} process as employed during the 20th century. The process grew somewhat in complexity {{with the passage of}} time, as gradually {{it was found that the}} inclusion of additional procedures improved quality. However the practice of hot rolling and then cold rolling evidently goes back to the early days, as the Knight family's tinplate works had (from its foundation in about 1740) two rolling mills, one at Bringewood (west of Ludlow) which made <b>blackplate,</b> and the other the tin mill at Mitton (now part of Stourport, evidently for the later stages.|$|E
5000|$|The slitter at Wolverley was Thomas Cooke. Another Thomas Cooke, {{perhaps his}} son, moved to Pontypool and worked there for John Hanbury (1664-1734). [...] According to Edward Lhuyd, by 1697, John Hanbury had a rolling mill at Pontypool for making [...] "Pontypoole Plates" [...] machine. [...] This has been claimed as a {{tinplate}} works, {{but it was}} almost certainly only producing (untinned) <b>blackplate.</b> However, this method of rolling iron plates by means of cylinders, enabled more uniform black plates to be produced than was possible with the old plan of hammering, and in consequence the English tinplate became recognized as superior to the German.Tinplate first begins {{to appear in the}} Gloucester Port Books (which record trade passing through Gloucester, mostly from ports in the Bristol Channel in 1725. The tinplate was shipped from Newport, Monmouthshire. [...] This immediately follows the first appearance (in French of Réaumur's Principes de l'art de fer-blanc, and prior to a report of it being published in England.|$|E
