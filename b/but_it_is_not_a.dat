5|$|There {{are also}} other related unequivalent tilings, {{such as the}} hexagon-boat-star and MikullaRoth tilings. For instance, if the {{matching}} rules for the rhombus tiling are reduced to a specific restriction on the angles permitted at each vertex, a binary tiling is obtained. Its underlying symmetry is also fivefold <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> quasicrystal. It can be obtained either by decorating the rhombs of the original tiling with smaller ones, or by applying substitution rules, but not by de Bruijn's cut-and-project method.|$|E

25|$|The use of maggot {{therapy is}} not limited to humans, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> common {{practice}} with livestock. Using maggot therapy with livestock could be beneficial in many ways. In dairy cattle, it would eliminate the need to destroy milk contaminated with antibiotics. The use of antibiotics on horses can affect its gastrointestinal flora which may result in colitis. Maggot therapy would eliminate this additional stress when treating equine wounds. Treatment options for the animals of people who cannot afford expensive surgeries would be a new possibility for veterinarians using this therapy.|$|E

25|$|Dispositions {{are also}} {{importantly}} public and hence observable. If I prefer brie to Camembert but keep this fact secret— never showing my preference, scrupulously giving no evidence from which my preference may be observed or deduced — then the preference remains strictly private. It may be aptly called a preference, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> disposition in Bourdieu's sense and arguably {{not in the}} everyday sense either. A disposition performs, enacts a preference; however trivial, even when disputing {{the relative merits of}} cheeses, a disposition is a public declaration of where one stands, what one's allegiances are.|$|E

In 2005 and 2006, netball was the 10th most popular spectator sport for women after tennis. Netball was brought to Australia by English school teachers, with a team having been organised by 1904 at Parramatta Superior Schools. In 1927, a national federation for the sport, Australian Women's Basketball Association, was created. Australia's national team toured England in 1957, {{which resulted in a}} number of Commonwealth countries organising a meeting to try to standardise the rules of the game.|$|E
25|$|Both {{universal}} algebra {{and model}} theory study classes of (structures or) algebras that {{are defined by}} a signature {{and a set of}} axioms. In the case of model theory these axioms have the form of first-order sentences. The formalism of universal algebra is much more restrictive; essentially it only allows first-order sentences that have the form of universally quantified equations between terms, e.g. xy(x+y=y+x). One consequence is that the choice of a signature is more significant in universal algebra than it is in model theory. For example, the class of groups, in the signature consisting of the binary function symbol × and the constant symbol 1, is an elementary class, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> variety. Universal algebra solves this problem by adding a unary function symbol −1.|$|E

25|$|Light rail is {{generally}} powered by electricity, usually {{by means of}} overhead wires, but sometimes by a live rail, also called third rail (a high voltage bar alongside the track), requiring safety measures and warnings to the public not to touch it. In some cases, particularly when initial funds are limited, diesel-powered versions have been used, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> preferred option. Some systems, such as AirTrain JFK in New York City, are automatic, dispensing {{with the need for}} a driver; however, such systems are not what {{is generally}} thought of as light rail, crossing over into rapid transit. Automatic operation is more common in smaller people mover systems than in light rail systems, where the possibility of grade crossings and street running make driverless operation of the latter inappropriate.|$|E
25|$|Biggeri and Mehrotra {{have studied}} the {{macroeconomic}} factors that encourage child labour. They focus their study on five Asian nations including India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines. They suggest that child labour {{is a serious problem}} in all five, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> new problem. Macroeconomic causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. They suggest that the causes for child labour include both the demand and the supply side. While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child labour supply side, they suggest that the growth of low-paying informal economy rather than higher paying formal economy is amongst the causes of the demand side. Other scholars too suggest that inflexible labour market, sise of informal economy, inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.|$|E
25|$|One {{consequence}} of these positions that Unger points {{to is the}} revision of the concept and function of mathematics. If {{there is only one}} world drenched in time through and through, then mathematics cannot be a timeless expression of multiple universes that captures reality. Rather, Unger argues that mathematics is a means of analyzing the world removed of time and phenomenal distinction. By emptying the world of time and space it is able to better focus on one aspect of reality: the recurrence of certain ways in which pieces of the world relate to other pieces. Its subject matter are the structured wholes and bundles of relations, which we see outside mathematics only as embodied in the time-bound particulars of the manifest world. In this way, mathematics extends our problem solving powers as an extension of human insight, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> part of the world.|$|E
