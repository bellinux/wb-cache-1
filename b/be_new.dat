5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York City, they stayed {{for several days}} and an exhibition game was organised. The match was played in Brooklyn and was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>New</b> Zealand versus New York, however several New Zealanders played for New York {{to make up their}} numbers. Despite this New Zealand won the match. The team then travelled to San Francisco, via the Niagara Falls, Chicago, and the Grand Canyon. In San Francisco they played two matches against British Columbia; the first won 43–6 and the second 65–6. From there they sailed back to New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing the {{practicality}} of this solution, Admiral Rodman {{requested that}} the Navy Department send another battleship to operate with his division. Specifically, Rodman requested the ship <b>be</b> <b>New</b> Yorks sister ship , to better match Grand Fleet policy, which encouraged the use of matched pairs to aid in rangefinding. Although there was some grumbling at the Navy Department that a five ship division was counter to U.S. Navy policy, they eventually agreed, and on 11 February 1918, Texas arrived at Scapa Flow.|$|E

5|$|During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, first {{discovered}} by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1642, and claimed the North and South islands for the British crown in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, {{interaction between the}} indigenous Māori population and Europeans {{was limited to the}} trading of goods. European settlement increased through {{the early decades of the}} 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. In 1839, the New Zealand Company announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain William Hobson and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi. This treaty is considered by many to <b>be</b> <b>New</b> Zealand's founding document, but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 4,000 {{species of}} fungi, {{including}} lichen-forming {{species have been}} recorded from Malaysia. Of the two fungal groups with {{the largest number of}} species in Malaysia, the Ascomycota and their asexual states have been surveyed in some habitats (decaying wood, marine and freshwater ecosystems, as parasites of some plants, and as agents of biodegradation), but have not been or have been only poorly surveyed in other habitats (as endobionts, in soils, on dung, as human and animal pathogens); the Basidiomycota are only partly surveyed: bracket fungi, and mushrooms and toadstools have been studied, but Malaysian rust and smut fungi remain very poorly known. Without doubt, many more fungal species in Malaysia have not yet been recorded, and it is likely that many of those, when found, will <b>be</b> <b>new</b> to science.|$|E
5|$|SBS {{implementation}} on {{the corridor}} {{is planned for}} November 2017. In the Rockaways and in Broad Channel, due to less dense land uses, and due to lower utilization of stops, several existing Q52 and Q53 stops will be consolidated or discontinued. Q22 local service will continue to serve the stops in the Rockaways, while the low volume stops at Cross Bay Boulevard and 5th Road will be discontinued. A new stop at Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach 84th Street would replace stops at Beach 81st Street and Beach 86th Street on the Q52. In Broad Channel two stops would be relocated: the northbound stop at Cross Bay Boulevard and East 9th Road would be moved north to Noel Road to be symmetrical with the southbound stop, and the southbound stop at West 15th Road would be moved south to West 17th Road to be symmetrical with the northbound stop, and to be adjacent to a crosswalk. Stops on Woodhaven Boulevard would be modified as well: the stop at Atlantic Avenue would be moved north to 91st Avenue, allowing Q52 and Q53 service to use the overpass over Atlantic Avenue using the bus lane, as opposed to using the slow service road. Two SBS stops will be added–at 101st Avenue and Woodhaven Boulevard, and at Pitkin Avenue and Cross Bay Boulevard–to provide transfers to the Q8 and Q11, respectively. Stations on Woodhaven Boulevard at Jamaica Avenue, 91st Avenue and 101st Avenue, and at Cross Bay Boulevard at Liberty Avenue (northbound) and Rockaway Boulevard (southbound) would <b>be</b> <b>new</b> stations that {{were built in the}} median by the NYCDOT.|$|E
