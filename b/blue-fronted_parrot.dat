40|$|Abstract: Seventy-five {{percent of}} psittacine species, {{including}} the <b>blue-fronted</b> Amazon <b>parrot</b> (Amazona aestiva), {{are classified as}} sexually monomorphic. However, this classification {{is based on the}} inability of the trichromatic human eye to perceive light in the near-ultraviolet spectrum. Spectrometry is a technique that enables humans to recognize the increased range of color perceived by the tetrachromatic avian eye. By using this technique, researchers have reclassified many avian species as sexually dimorphic. In this exploratory study, several body regions of 30 <b>blue-fronted</b> Amazon <b>parrots</b> (males and females) were investigated by multiple-angle spectrometry. A model was developed that enabled gender prediction with 100 % accuracy based on plumage color characteristics. However, the areas that were most promising in our model (forehead and wing tip) need to be confirmed independently to exclude the possibility of type I error attributed to multiple testing...|$|R
50|$|The <b>blue-fronted</b> fig <b>parrot,</b> also {{referred}} to as the blue-browed fig parrot, is a putative undescribed fig parrot said to inhabit the rugged rainforest-covered border ranges of subtropical south-eastern Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales, Australia.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to evaluate fecal concentrations of metabolites of glucocorticoids, measured by enzyme immunoassay with a cortisol antibody and by radioimmunoassay with a corticosterone antibody, and progesterone by radioimmunoassay with a progesterone antibody in <b>blue-fronted</b> <b>parrot</b> (Amazona aestiva) after ACTH challenge. The adrenal stimulation with ACTH (25 UI/animal) resulted in an increase of fecal glucocorticoids metabolites concentration, but it did not affect the concentrations of fecal progesterone metabolites. Although there were no synchronized peaks of glucocorticoid metabolites excretion measured by enzyme immunoassay and radioimmunoassay, there were two peaks of excretion, one at 2 - 4 hours and other at 8 - 10 hours. Despite the occurrence of peaks, the analysis of fecal glucocorticoids metabolites and progesterone metabolites showed no effect of group (control and treatment), moment (hours of sampling) and sex...|$|E
40|$|Local {{anesthetic}} {{procedures are}} commonly used in domestic and wild birds, because of its low cost and fast induction, as long as applied with great precision, which requires specific anatomical knowledge of the site of incision. This study aimed to establish the origin and distribution of the brachial plexus of the <b>Blue-fronted</b> <b>Parrot</b> (Amazona aestiva) by anatomic dissection of the skin and musculature of 22 specimens (17 males and 5 females) from the Wild Animals Screening Center of the Federal District after death by natural causes. The dissection work promoted {{the isolation of the}} forming roots of the brachial plexus, as well as its ramifications. The brachial plexus was formed by four trunks, including the ventral spinal cord rami segments from C 9 to C 10, C 10 to C 11, C 11 to T 1 and T 1 to T 2, which joined into a short common trunk, branched into dorsal and ventral cords. The thin nerves subcoracoideus and subscapularis and the branch to the scapulohumeralis muscle originated from the common trunk. The dorsal cord originated the anconeal, axillaris and radialis nerves, while the ventral cord gave origin for the pectoralis cranialis, pectoralis caudalis, coracobrachialis and medianoulnaris. These branches innervated the muscles of the extensor and flexor compartments of the forelimb, pectoral muscles and overlying skin...|$|E
40|$|Parrots kept in zoos {{and private}} {{households}} often develop psychological and behavioural disorders. Despite knowing that such disorders have a multifactorial aetiology and that chronic stress is involved, {{little is known}} about their development mainly due to a poor understanding of the parrots' physiology and the lack of validated methods to measure stress in these species. In birds, blood corticosterone concentrations provide information about adrenocortical activity. However, blood sampling techniques are difficult, highly invasive and inappropriate to investigate stressful situations and welfare conditions. Thus, a non-invasive method to measure steroid hormones is critically needed. Aiming to perform a physiological validation of a cortisone enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to measure glucocorticoid metabolites (GCM) in droppings of 24 Blue-fronted parrots (Amazona aestiva), two experiments were designed. During the experiments all droppings were collected at 3 -h intervals. Initially, birds were sampled for 24 h (experiment 1) and one week later assigned to four different treatments (experiment 2) : Control (undisturbed), Saline (0. 2 mL of 0. 9 % NaCl IM), Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg IM) and Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 25 IU IM). Treatments (always one week apart) were applied to all animals in a cross-over study design. A daily rhythm pattern in GCM excretion was detected but there were no sex differences (first experiment). Saline and dexamethasone treatments had no effect on GCM (not different from control concentrations). Following ACTH injection, GCM concentration increased about 13. 1 -fold (median) at the peak (after 3 - 9 h), and then dropped to pre-treatment concentrations. By a successful physiological validation, we demonstrated the suitability of the cortisone EIA to non-invasively monitor increased adrenocortical activity, and thus, stress in the <b>Blue-fronted</b> <b>parrot.</b> This method opens up new perspectives for investigating the connection between behavioural disorders and stress in this bird species, and could also help in their captive management...|$|E

40|$|No Brasil, o papagaio-verdadeiro (Amazona aestiva) é uma das aves mais procuradas como animal de estimação e comercializadas ilegalmente. Na {{literatura}} pouco é descrito sobre a microbiota intestinal de aves silvestres. O trato intestinal das aves é composto por inúmeras e diferentes espécies bacterianas. A grande maioria são bactérias gram-positivas pertencentes ao grupo de bactérias ácido-láticas. Este estudo teve como objetivo isolar e identificar a presença de bactérias dos gêneros Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Pediococcus e Lactococcus na microbiota entérica de papagaios Amazona aestiva de vida livre e de cativeiro. Para isto foram coletadas amostras de 26 aves de vida livre e de 26 aves procedentes de dois criadouros comerciais. O Enterococcus foi o gênero que apresentou maior freqüência de isolamentos (100 %), seguido dos gêneros Pediococcus (63, 46 %), Lactobacillus (28, 84 %), Lactococcus e Bifidobacterium (15, 38 %). Foram isoladas 12 espécies de Enterococcus, sendo o E. faecium a espécie que apresentou maior ocorrência de isolamento, presente em 63, 46 % das aves, seguido por E. faecalis isolado em 57, 69 % das aves, Enterococcus sp. identificado em 46, 15 % das aves, E. hirae em 30, 76 % e E. raffinosus em 19, 23 %. Seis espécies de Pediococcus foram isoladas, sendo que P. pentosaceus foi a mais freqüente e esteve presente em 57, 69 % das aves. Foram isoladas cinco (5) espécies de Lactococcus, sendo L. lactis subsp. cremoris isolados em 3, 84 % das aves e Lactococcus sp. em 9, 61 %. Lactobacillus apresentou uma maior diversidade, com 14 espécies identificadas, sendo as mais freqüentes L. coryniformis subsp. torquens e L. sanfrancisco com 7, 69 % de aves positivas para cada espécie. Três (3) espécies de Bifidobacterium foram isoladas, sendo B. bifidum identificado em 9, 61 % das aves. Estudos complementares precisam ser conduzidos para uma melhor compreensão da microbiota intestinal das aves silvestres, assim como analisar as similaridades e diferenças com as aves domésticas, o que permitirá um manejo apropriado e menos empírico desta espécie em cativeiro. In Brazil, <b>Blue-fronted</b> <b>Parrot</b> (Amazona aestiva) {{has been}} widely owned as a pet bird and, therefore, one of the Brazilians birds most frequently traded illegally in the Black Market. There are few reports in the current literature regarding to the microbiota of wild birds. The gastrointestinal tract of these birds has {{a wide variety of}} bacterial species; most of them are Gram positive bacteria and belongs to the lactic acid group. The present study has isolated and identified Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Pediococcus, and Lactococcus bacterias present in fecal samples of wild and captive Amazona aestiva parrots. Fifty two fecal samples were collected from 26 wild parrots and 26 parrots from commercial breeders. Enterococcus genus was the most frequently isolated (100 %), followed by Pediococcus (63. 46 %), Lactobacillus (28. 84 %), Lactococcus and Bifidobacterium (15. 38 %). Twelve species of Enterococcus were identified. E. faecium was the most frequently isolated from the birds representing 63. 46 %, followed by E. faecalis (57. 69 %), Enterococcus sp. (46. 15 %), E. hirae (30. 76 %), and E. raffinosus (19. 23 %). P. pentosaceus was identified from 57. 69 % of the parrots. This specie was the most frequently isolated. Five different species of Lactococcus were found out. Lactococcus sp. was identified from 9. 61 % of the birds, while L. lactis subsp. lactis represented 3. 84 %. Fourteen different species of Lactobacillus were isolated, showing the biggest diversity among all the studied genera. L. coryniformis subsp. torquens and L. sanfrancisco were isolated from 7. 69 % of the birds. Three different species of Bifidobacterium were isolated, and B. bifidum was identified in 9. 61 % of the birds, being the most frequently isolated. Further studies are needed to a better comprehension of the microbiota in wild birds. Besides comparing differences and similarities between wildlife parrots and pet birds will allow appropriate and less empiric management of those birds in captivity...|$|E

40|$|Predation {{is one of}} {{the main}} factors {{responsible}} for the failure of reintroduction/translocation programs. Animal's personality and sex can also influence key behaviors for survival and reproduction. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of anti-predator training, personality and sex on the survival and behaviors of translocated <b>blue-fronted</b> Amazon <b>parrots.</b> Thirty-one captive-raised parrots were translocated to a Cerrado area in Brazil. Parrots were separated into two groups: anti-predator trained group (ATG) and control group (CG). Personality tests were performed with individuals of the ATG group. Data were collected using focal sampling with instantaneous recording of behavior every minute. Anti-predator training, personality and sex did not influenced parrots' survival after release. However, anti-predator training proved to be efficient in eliciting more natural behaviors in parrots after release. Shy individuals and males showed to be more sociable than bold individuals and females. Personality and sex did not influence behavior exhibition. Parrots interacted more, positively or negatively, with individuals of its own group. Training session closer to the release date should be tried. Behavioral data and not just survival rates should be used to evaluate the efficiency of the techniques, because behavior can give clues about the adaptation of the individuals to the new habitat, increasing the success of the conservation program...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the protein requirements for hand-rearing <b>Blue-fronted</b> Amazon <b>parrots</b> (Amazona aestiva). Forty hatchlings were fed semi-purified diets containing one of four (as-fed basis) protein levels: 13 %, 18 %, 23 % and 28 %. The experiment was carried out in a randomized block design with the initial weight of the nestling as the blocking factor and 10 parrots per protein level. Regression analysis was used to determine relationships between protein level and biometric measurements. The data indicated that 13 % crude protein supported nestling growth with 18 % being the minimum tested level required for maximum development. The optimal protein concentration for maximum weight gain was 24. 4 % (p = 0. 08; r(2) = 0. 25), tail length 23. 7 % (p = 0. 09; r(2) = 0. 19), wing length 23. 0 % (p = 0. 07; r(2) = 0. 17), tarsus length 21. 3 % (p = 0. 06; r(2) = 0. 10) and tarsus width 21. 4 % (p = 0. 07; r(2) = 0. 09). Tarsus measurements were larger in males (p < 0. 05), indicating that sex must be considered when studying developing psittacines.
