5|$|In {{the major}} MRT {{disruption}} of 15 December 2011, one C151 train (trainset 067/068, T139 in the COI) was stalled {{in the tunnel}} and its backup battery failed. The passenger compartments in T139 experienced a blackout and loss of ventilation, leading to one passenger smashing a train door window to avoid suffocation. The <b>battery</b> <b>failure</b> led to criticism by the COI {{on the condition of}} the aging emergency batteries installed on all C151 trains. SMRT has since proposed an upgrading plan to address this issue.|$|E
5|$|Vergne {{dropped down}} the order when his car {{developed}} a water pump <b>battery</b> <b>failure</b> {{and was forced}} to make an unscheduled pit stop to move into his second vehicle on lap eight, while di Grassi made his required pit stop for a replacement front wing on the same lap and narrowly avoided striking a trackside marshal after leaving his pit stall. López had dropped to 18th place by the start of the following lap. Bird briefly reduced the time deficit to Piquet until the latter responded to the Virgin car's fast pace. Rosenqvist lost control of the back-end of his car and slid backwards into the turn five barrier on the 14th lap, damaging his rear wing. The incident forced him to make a pit stop for the switch into his second car. López carried a large amount of speed exiting the chicane and made heavy contact with the wall on lap 17. Piquet was close behind him and took avoiding action but reacted late and had an understeer which sent him into the barrier. He did not damage his car and was able to reverse out of the barrier but lost the lead to Bird and Buemi moved into second place. The incident necessitated the deployment of the safety car to allow marshals to repair the wall and extract López's car from the track. Some drivers (including Buemi) elected to make mandatory pit stops to switch into their second cars under safety car conditions {{at the end of the}} 20th lap.|$|E

40|$|On 16 January 2013, all Boeing 787 Dreamliners were indefinitely {{grounded}} due to lithium-ion <b>battery</b> <b>failures</b> {{that had}} occurred in two planes. Subsequent investigations into the <b>battery</b> <b>failures</b> released through the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) factual report, the March 15 th Boeing press conference in Japan, and the NTSB hearings in Washington D.

This paper discusses the challenges to lithium-ion battery qualification, reliability assessment, and safety in light of the Boeing 787 <b>battery</b> <b>failures.</b> New assessment methods and control techniques that can improve battery reliability and safety in avionic systems are then presented...|$|R

25|$|David Bram from Vacaville, California {{was charged}} with {{conspiracy}} to commit assault and battery, unlawfully striking another soldier, violating a lawful order, dereliction of duty, cruelty and maltreament and endeavoring to impede an investigation. In May 2011 additional charges were filed against Bram including solicitation to commit premeditated murder, aggravated assault on Afghan civilians, planting evidence and unlawfully discussing murder scenarios with subordinates. He was convicted by an enlisted panel sitting as a general court-martial of conspiracy to commit assault and <b>battery,</b> <b>failure</b> to obey a general order, dereliction of duty, maltreatment of a subordinate, assault consummated by battery, obstruction of justice, and solicitation of another to commit murder. Bram was sentenced to a dishonorable discharge, reduction to the lowest enlisted grade, and {{five years in prison}} eligible for parole after serving about 3 years and four months of his five-year sentence. The U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence, and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces denied review.|$|E
2500|$|Dragon Quest IX was {{designed}} to be the hardest Dragon Quest game yet. The rationale is that the developers said, [...] "people can always find out information on the internet — like that's part of the game experience." [...] In addition, the game has only one save slot. Ryutaro Ichimura, producer of Dragon Quest IX, clarified the reason explaining that there is not enough space on the system given the amount of freedom the game allows. Instead, the extra slot is used for a backup in case of <b>battery</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Following battery re-generation {{problems}} {{on his car}} that left him unable to finish the event after having led the first 16 laps, Abt spoke of his annoyance and revealed he had some issues with his first car: [...] "But still {{we were in a}} position to at least take a podium here which would have been good points. Still good, and then last lap my car shuts off with a <b>battery</b> <b>failure</b> or whatever. It’s annoying." [...] He was also disappointed over losing the possibility of finishing on the podium, but said it was continually satisfying to compete {{at the front of the}} pack but it felt more satisfying to be the first driver to finish the race: [...] "I don’t know why this always happens to me, so many times. It’s just really annoying because in the end people forget what happened." ...|$|E

50|$|In the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's {{first year}} of service, at least four {{aircraft}} suffered from electrical system problems stemming from its lithium-ion batteries, resulting in the whole Dreamliner fleet being voluntarily grounded in January 2013. The Federal Aviation Administration decided on April 19, 2013 to allow US Dreamliners to return to service after changes were made to their battery systems. Japanese authorities announced they were doing the same for their airplanes. The causes of the <b>battery</b> <b>failures</b> are still unknown.|$|R
30|$|There was no {{significant}} difference in fracture rate; there were two fractures in the manual group (5  %) and one fracture in the motorized group (4  %). There were four different mechanical failures in the motorized group: dead batteries, a bent plug, a bent rod and a motor that failed because of torque. The unexpected <b>battery</b> <b>failures</b> were caused by excessively high chlorine levels in the rehabilitation facility swimming pool that dissolved the neoprene seals. All of these problems were diagnosed quickly, the failures were repaired and the lengthening procedures were continued.|$|R

In this paper the results from a study to investigate the effects of adding carbon fibre additive to red lead positive paste are presented.

Results suggest the addition of carbon fibre to positive paste increases capacity by approximately 20 %. Significant improvements in cycle life were also observed...|$|R
50|$|On July 29, 1969, {{less than}} a week before closest approach, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) lost contact with Mariner 7.

Leaking gases from a battery (which later failed) were thought to have caused the anomaly. Based on the {{observations}} that Mariner 6 made, Mariner 7 was reprogrammed in flight to take further observations of areas of interest and actually returned more pictures than Mariner 6, despite the <b>battery's</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{subclass}} of vapers configure their atomizers {{to produce}} {{large amounts of}} vapor by using low-resistance heating coils.

40|$|Autosub 6000 is an {{autonomous}} underwater vehicle developed and operated by the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton. The vehicle development {{was funded by the}} United Kingdom’s Natural Environment Research Council(NERC). The credibility of Autosub 6000 to perform science missions is directly related to its reliability and availability. The aim of this report is to provide reliability and availability analysis of Autosub 6000 based on the vehicle operational history. This report considers the operational history from September 2007 to September 2012, during which seven campaigns were conducted and a total of 68 missions were carried out by Autosub 6000. Eight of the missions ended prematurely. The two most frequently observed failure modes in its fault history were GPS and <b>battery</b> <b>failures.</b> Both failures raised design errors that have since then been addressed. The report concludes that Autosub 6000 failure rate is correlated with two factors: 1. the maximum operating depth and 2. whether or not new technology is being used. Operations at depth greater than 3000 metres are 92...|$|R
