40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} legal framework of the <b>bid</b> <b>protest</b> system in Iraq, {{which is designed to}} check illegalities and irregularities in awarding public contracts by contracting agencies. Several regional and international agreements emphasize the significance of <b>bid</b> <b>protest</b> processes for member states. However, the mere existence of <b>bid</b> <b>protest</b> forums is not sufficient to ensure their effectiveness. The vast majority of developing countries have <b>bid</b> <b>protest</b> mechanisms, but {{this does not mean that}} they are functioning as necessary. This work begins by assessing the theoretical controversies surrounding the issue of what works best, more discretion or more oversight, in public administration and legal jurisprudence. In addition, the procedural rules of bid protests in Iraq are examined. Since availability of effective remedies is a prerequisite for a functioning <b>bid</b> <b>protest</b> system, remedies available to unsatisfied bidders under the Iraqi laws and regulations are also examined. Other forms of monetary compensation available to protesters are also addressed. Cooperation between anticorruption agencies and <b>bid</b> <b>protest</b> mechanisms is also considered. This dissertation concludes that the <b>bid</b> <b>protest</b> system in Iraq does not effectively scrutinize the processes of awarding public contracts that require more transparency. <b>Bid</b> <b>protest</b> processes should be improved by amending the laws and regulations involved. Such amendments should be conducted in light of the principles of transparency and accountability by facilitating access to <b>bid</b> <b>protest</b> mechanisms and expanding the rights of those challenging procurement activities...|$|E

50|$|With the February 2009 {{stimulus}} bill allocating approximately $140 billion for federal, {{state and local}} construction projects, battles over government-mandated PLAs on public works projects from 2009 to 2011 have been widespread {{at the state and}} local government level. Government officials and legislators have clashed over using PLA mandates on projects in states including Iowa, Oregon, Ohio, California, and others. Individual communities have voted on whether to prohibit the use of government-mandated PLAs on taxpayer funded construction projects, including ballot initiatives in Chula Vista, Oceanside, and in San Diego County, California in 2010, which resulted in officials being prohibited from mandating or prohibiting the use of PLAs for government projects. In 2011, contractors filed <b>bid</b> <b>protests</b> with the Government Accountability Office against government mandated PLAs for construction projects in New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.

40|$|In his provocative article, Competitive Public Contracts, Eric M. Singer {{claims that}} {{deficient}} contractor performance {{is inherent in}} government contracting. Singer asserts that, “fundamentally,” public purchasing has a “contract-remedies problem”—the absence of both any “credible threat” and any “effective contract remedy to deter or correct [contractor] misbehavior. ” Unlike private buyers, who have plausible threats to motivate contractors to perform properly, governments are said to “often” labor under intrinsic and extrinsic limitations that undermine remedial alternatives. Consequently, Singer argues that governments (especially state and local agencies) have no “effective contract remedy” to induce improved contractor performance. Among these “ineffective” remedies, according to Singer, are terminations for default and past performance assessments of contractors. This Response proceeds as follows: Part I disputes Singer’s charge that termination for default fails as a contractor control mechanism. Part II disagrees with Singer’s descriptive claim that agencies “underutilize[]” even “useful” past performance assessments. He contends, without empirical support, that government actors “frequently elect not to advertise” contractor performance failures for fears of both generating <b>bid</b> <b>protests</b> from the slighted firm and impugning {{the integrity of the}} procurement officer that awarded the earlier contract. Part III asserts that, besides raising efficiency issues, CDS is not legally workable because it conflicts with the principles of default terminations and contract options. Rather than being inherently problematic, current remedies in government contracting reflect the reality that “[t]he Government wields enormous powers in its contractual relations. ...|$|R
