40|$|Graduation date: 2011 In the Willamette Valley of Oregon, a {{combination}} of the need for rotational crops and an increased desire for biofuel production created interest in planting Brassica napus (canola). However, questions were raised arisen over the potential damage canola production could have on the preexisting <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetable</b> seed industry. To address these concerns three studies were conducted to: 1.) Determine the potential of gene flow and hybridization via pollen from Brassica napus to related <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetable</b> crops; 2.) Evaluate whether transgenes will be detectable in harvested <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetable</b> seed; 3.) Evaluate the potential for volunteer canola to become a contaminant in the <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetable</b> seed crops. Crossing experiments were conducted in 2007, 2008, and 2009 using Brassica rapa or Brassica oleracea inbred line receptor plants placed within conventional B. napus fields. Once seed set occurred on the receptor plants, each was harvested individually and the seed germinated in a growth chamber. Flow cytometry, morphological and molecular analyses were performed on the seedlings. Hybridization between B. napus and B. rapa inbreds was 74 % in 2007, 89 % in 2008, and 15 % in 2009. However, no hybridization occurred between B. napus and the B. oleracea inbred lines. Experiments were conducted using transgenic B. napus and the previously mentioned vegetable species, to quantify outcrossing rates in a greenhouse environment. Transgenes were detectable in both germinable and non-germinable seed produced on non-transgenic plants. Following B. napus harvest at the field sites, shattered canola seed was collected from both windrow and non-windrow locations. Approximately 30 days after the shatter samples were taken, canola seedling recruitment counts were made in quadrats placed immediately adjacent to the location of the seed shatter samples. Results of this volunteer assessment indicated differences in seed shatter between fields and windrow vs. non-windrow locations, but seedling recruitment only differed by fields. These studies indicate that canola, if grown in the Willamette Valley, has the potential to hybridize with related <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetable</b> species grown for seed. However, when managed properly, canola volunteer persistence is unlikely to be an issue within fields in the monocot crop rotations used in the Willamette Valley...|$|R

The alternative product of estrogen metabolism, 2 -hydroxyestrone, does not exhibit estrogenic properties in breast tissue, and lower values of the ratio 2 -hydroxyestrone: 16 a-hydroxyestrone (2 : 16) in urine may be an endocrine biomarker for greater breast cancer risk. <b>Vegetables</b> of the <b>Brassica</b> genus, such as broccoli, contain a phytochemical, which may shift estrogen metabolism and increase the 2 : 16 ratio. Adding 500 g/day of broccoli to a standard diet shifts 2 : 16 values upward in humans; however, it is unknown as to whether healthy women are able to consume a sufficient quantity of Brassica to affect breast cancer risk through this mechanism. In this study, 34 healthy postmenopausal women participated in an intensive intervention designed to facilitate the addition of Brassica to the daily diet. The diet was measured by repeated 24 -h recall, and estrogen metabolites were measured by enzyme immunoassay in 24 -h urine samples. In a crude analysis, there was a nonsignificant increase in the urinary 2 : 16 ratio associated with greater Brassica consumption. With adjustment for other dietary parameters, <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption was associated with a statistically significant increase in 2 : 16 values, such that for each 10 -g/day increase in Brassica consumption, there was an increase in the 2 : 16 ratio of 0. 08 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 02 – 0. 15).

Method Selenium-enriched broccoli sprouts were prepared using a sodium selenite solution. Their anticancer properties were evaluated in human prostate cancer cell lines and compared with those of a control broccoli sprout extract. Results Selenium-enriched broccoli sprouts were superior to normal broccoli sprouts in inhibiting cell proliferation, decreasing prostate-specific antigen secretion, and inducing apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, selenium-enriched broccoli sprouts but, not normal broccoli sprouts, induced a downregulation of the survival Akt/mTOR pathway.
