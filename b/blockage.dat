40|$|Operational {{failures}} {{persist in}} hospitals, {{in part because}} employees work around them rather than attempt to prevent recurrence. Drawing on a process improvement tool—the Andon cord—we examine three work design components that may foster improvement-oriented behaviors: 1) <b>blockages</b> to prevent workarounds; 2) a support person to assist with problem-solving; and 3) education portraying operational failures as “waste ” {{to be removed from}} the system. Using laboratory experiments, we test each component’s impact on whether hospital nurses speak up about medication administration problems and contribute improvement ideas. We find that each component provides its own contribution to organizational performance. <b>Blockages</b> encourage people to suggest improvement ideas, while education sparks improvement suggestions even when there are no <b>blockages.</b> <b>Blockages</b> can backfire, however, if they are difficult to work around in a policy-compliant manner and problem-solving support is unavailable. Under these conditions, <b>blockages</b> led to a risky workaround associated with a 10 X overdose of insulin. Risky workarounds can be mitigated with a readily-available support person, whose presence also elicits higher levels of speaking up about operational failures. ...|$|R
5|$|Scientists {{initially}} {{hypothesized that}} acne represented {{a disease of}} the skin's hair follicle, and occurred due to <b>blockage</b> of the pore by sebum. During the 1880s, bacteria were observed by microscopy in skin samples affected by acne and were regarded as the causal agents of comedones, sebum production, and ultimately acne. During the mid-twentieth century, dermatologists realized that no single hypothesized factor (sebum, bacteria, or excess keratin) could completely explain the disease. This led to the current understanding that acne {{could be explained by}} a sequence of related events, beginning with <b>blockage</b> of the skin follicle by excessive dead skin cells, followed by bacterial invasion of the hair follicle pore, changes in sebum production, and inflammation.|$|E

40|$|The {{radiation}} pattern of an antenna array {{depends on the}} excitation weights and the geometry of the array. Due to wind and atmospheric conditions, outdoor millimeter wave antenna elements are subject to full or partial <b>blockages</b> from a plethora of particles like dirt, salt, ice, and water droplets. Handheld devices are also subject to <b>blockages</b> from random finger placement and/or finger prints. These <b>blockages</b> cause absorption and scattering to the signal incident on the array, and change the array geometry. This distorts the far-field {{radiation pattern}} of the array leading {{to an increase in}} the sidelobe level and decrease in gain. This paper studies the effects of <b>blockages</b> on the far-field radiation pattern of linear arrays and proposes two array diagnosis techniques for millimeter wave antenna arrays. The proposed techniques jointly estimate the locations of the blocked antennas and the induced attenuation and phase shifts. Numerical results show that the proposed techniques provide satisfactory results in terms of fault detection with reduced number of measurements (diagnosis time) provided that the number of <b>blockages</b> is small compared to the array size...|$|R

Gené retired on lap 22 with a gearbox issue as his teammate Mazzacane subsequently collided with the barriers at turn one on the same lap and had to retire from the event. Herbert became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 27 although his pit crew came unprepared and Herbert was stationary for half a minute before he exited in 17th position. On the 31st lap, Diniz made contact with the barriers at turn one and he damaged his left rear wheel, causing him to retire. Häkkinen's pace was reduced by lap 36 as he slowed with an <b>blockage</b> on his brake pedal and made an unscheduled pit stop.

5|$|Acne is a {{very common}} problem, {{particularly}} during puberty in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum {{can lead to a}} <b>blockage</b> of the sebaceous gland duct. This can cause a comedo, (commonly called a blackhead or a whitehead), which can lead to infection, particularly by the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes. This can inflame the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. Comedones generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands, particularly the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be 'black' or 'white' depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit, or just the sebaceous duct, is blocked. Sebaceous filaments—innocuous build-ups of sebum—are often mistaken for whiteheads.|$|E
5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a <b>blockage</b> of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{the brain}} (such as from a massive stroke, {{non-penetrating}} head injury, intoxication or poisoning) {{may result in a}} depressed level of consciousness. When this becomes severe to the point of stupor or coma (defined as a score on the Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 8), dynamic collapse of the extrinsic muscles of the airway can obstruct the airway, impeding the free flow of air into the lungs. Furthermore, protective airway reflexes such as coughing and swallowing may be diminished or absent. Tracheal intubation is often required to restore patency (the relative absence of <b>blockage)</b> of the airway and protect the tracheobronchial tree from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.|$|E

The war reached a climax when the Eblaite vizier Ibbi-Sipish made an alliance with Nagar and Kish to defeat Mari in a battle near Terqa.

5|$|Lead-ions (Pb), like magnesium-ions (Mg), blocks NMDA receptors. Since {{the normal}} Pb {{concentration}} in the extracellular fluid is low (adult average of 120mg), even a low increase in Pb concentration has a significant positive affect on the <b>blockage</b> of NMDA-receptors. Therefore, an increase in Pb concentration, will, effectively, inhibit ongoing long-term potentiations (LTPs), and lead to an abnormal increase long-term depression (LDPs) on neurons on the effected parts of the nervous system. These abnormalities lead to the indirect downregulation of NMDA-receptors, effectively initiating a positive feedback-loop for LDP. The targeting of NMDA receptors {{is thought to be}} one of the main causes for lead's toxicity to neurons.|$|E

40|$|Data from call centres at two {{municipalities}} were analysed {{in order}} to quantify flooding frequencies and associated flood risks for three main failure mechanisms causing urban flooding. The aim was {{to find out whether}} current operational strategies are efficient for flood prevention and if directions for improvement could be found. The results show that quantified flood risk for the two cases is well above the standard which is defined in sewer management plans. The analysis pointed out that gully pot <b>blockages</b> are the main cause of flooding and handling gully pot <b>blockages</b> should therefore be a priority for sewer operators. Reactive handling of calls, as is currently applied, is inefficient if all calls are reacted upon since a small portion of all calls report serious consequences like flooding in buildings or wastewater flooding. Preventive cleaning of sewer pipes proves to be an efficient strategy to reduce flooding due to sewer <b>blockages</b> as flood risk associated with sewer <b>blockages</b> is lower in case of higher cleaning sewer frequencies. Sewer <b>blockages</b> often have serious consequences, thus preventive handling is to be preferred to reactive cleaning. According to the results of this analysis, reduction of flooding sewer overloading is not of primary concern, because serious consequences for this failure mechanism are rare compared to other failure mechanisms.
