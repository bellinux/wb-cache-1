40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{suggestion}} that antipsychotic drugs act by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain, the direct effects of such neuroleptic drugs were tested on the stereospecific binding of [3 H]dopamine and of [3 H]haloperidol to rat brain striata and their subfractions.

40|$|H- 1 NMR {{experiments}} at 300 MHz {{have been}} carried out to determine the identity and study the interconversion of two conformations of <b>butaclamol</b> in solution. The hydrochloride salt in DMSO exists as an equilibrium mixture of two conformations, which differ in their stereochemistry about the ring junction that contains the single nitrogen atom in <b>butaclamol.</b> The trans form has a relative population of 80 % and the cis I form 20 %. In CDCl 3 only the trans form is observed, while in CDCl 3 -DMSO mixtures, both forms are detected in a ratio (trans:cis I) that decreases as the percentage of CDCl 3 decreases. For the free base in either CD 2 Cl 2 or DMSO, only a single set of resonances is observed at room temperature, but as temperature is lowered, peaks from methine protons H 4 a and H 13 b near the ring junction broaden and (for samples in CD 2 Cl 2) eventually split into two resonances corresponding to the cis and trans forms. It is suggested that nitrogen inversion is the dynamic process responsible for the interconversion of the two forms. Line shape analysis as a function of temperature yielded an energy barrier of 9. 6 +/- 0. 5 kcal/mol for the interconversion, in good agreement with values obtained from saturation transfer experiments. In the hydrochloride salt, the barrier in DMSO was somewhat higher, i. e., 17. 3 +/- 0. 9 kcal/mol, as determined by saturation transfer and variable-temperature measurements...|$|E

The H- 1 NMR data strongly suggest the presence of a trans D-E ring junction and are consistent with a chair conformation of the E ring. C- 13 spin-lattice relaxation time measurements show that most of the molecule is rigid, although there is some degree of mobility in the seven-membered B ring, associated with rapid flipping of the bridging C 8 and C 9 carbons between two skewed conformations, which have previously been referred to as conformer A and conformer B (Laus et al.

40|$|Neuroleptic {{activity}} of the 5 -aryltetrahydro [...] y-carboline series. Conformational re-quirements for interaction with central dopamine receptors. Mol. Pharmacol. 17 : 38 - 42 (1980). A series of novel 5 -aryltetrahydro-’y-carboline neuroleptics is described. Their interaction with the dopamine receptor is demonstrated by their potent and long-lasting blockade of amphetamine-induced stereotyped behavior in rats and by the displacement of bound 3 H-spiroperidol in vitro. The 5 -aryl-’y-carboline nucleus appears to be primarily respon-sible for receptor interaction while the side chain serves to extend duration, presumably by altering metabolism and/or tissue distribution. The conformation of the semirigid 5 -aryl-’y-carboline nucleus approximates that of the previously proposed active conforma-tion of the open-chain diphenylbutylpiperidine neuroleptics. Comparison of the crystal structure of CP- 36, 584 with those of apomorphine and (+) -dexclamol suggests a common, conformationally restricted phenethylamine moiety as the species interacting with the receptor.

The dopaminergic antagonist (+) <b>butaclamol</b> inhibited activations of both types of ligands with equal potency (pA 2 = 8. 9 +/- 0. 1), indicating that only one type of receptor is involved. In competition with [3 H]raclopride binding, dopaminergic agonists showed 53 +/- 2 % of the binding sites in the GTP-dependent high-affinity state, whereas 5 -HT showed only 20 +/- 3 %.

40|$|Dopamine {{is found}} in many {{invertebrate}} organisms, including insects, however, the mechanisms through which this amine operates remain unclear. We have expressed two dopamine receptors cloned from honey bee (AmDOP 1 and AmDOP 2) in insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda), and compared their pharmacology directly using production of cAMP as a functional assay. In each assay, AmDOP 1 receptors required lower concentrations of dopamine and 6, 7 -ADTN for maximal activation than AmDOP 2 receptors. Conversely, <b>butaclamol</b> and cis(Z) -flupentixol were more potent at blocking the cAMP response mediated through AmDOP 2 than AmDOP 1 receptors. Expression of AmDOP 1, but not AmDOP 2, receptors significantly increased levels of cAMP {{even in the absence}} of ligand. This constitutive activity was blocked by cis(Z) -flupentixol. This work provides the first evidence of a constitutively activated dopamine receptor in invertebrates and suggests that although AmDOP 1 and AmDOP 2 share much less homology than their vertebrate counterparts, they display a number of functional parallels with the mammalian D 1 -like dopamine receptors.

Specific binding of [H- 3]SCH 23390 was saturable and reversible and stereoisomers of SCH 23390 competed stereoselectively. In contrast, {{competition with the}} isomers of <b>butaclamol</b> was not stereoselective and dopamine failed {{to compete for the}} [H- 3]SCH 23390 binding site. The site is therefore not a D 1 dopamine receptor.

The nature of [H- 3]SCH 23390 binding in preparations of tubular and glomerular membranes was found to be virtually identical to those of crude renal cortical membranes indicating lack of compartmentation of these sites. Autoradiographic studies of [H- 3]SCH 23390 binding in bovine kidney showed significantly higher levels of binding sites in renal cortex compared with renal medulla and this was confirmed by direct ligand binding studies...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} a {{luciferase}} reporter gene assay to study the functional responses of two G-protein-coupled receptors in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The rank order of potency of drugs for the endogenous 5 -HT 1 B receptor was 5 -Hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) > zolmitriptan > dihydroergocristine >(-) Lisuride (with no response to bromocriptine), However, only 5 -HT and (-) lisuride produced a full functional response, with zolmitriptan and dihydroergocristine achieving 69 +/- 2 % and 50 +/- 1 % of the maximal response. In the same cells stably transfected with the rat dopamine D- 2 L receptor, dopamine and bromocriptine produced a full agonist functional response, whilst (-) lisuride produced a biphasic response curve, indicating activity at both the endogenous 5 -HT 1 B and exogenous dopamine D- 2 L receptors. Using the receptor specific antagonists, pindolol and(+) <b>butaclamol,</b> (-) lisuride was shown to produce 52 % of the maximal response at the dopamine D- 2 receptor relative to dopamine. In comparison to a cAMP accumulation assay, the rank orders of potency and intrinsic activity were {{the same for all}} compounds used.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, {{detailed}} information is presented on the hetero-dimerization of the serotonin 5 -HT 2 A receptor and the dopamine D 2 receptor. Biophysical approaches (fluorescence spectroscopy {{as well as}} fluorescence lifetime microscopy) {{were used to determine}} the degree of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between cyan and yellow fluorescent protein labeled receptor variants co-expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293). Recorded data demonstrate the existence of energy transfer between the wild-type forms of 5 -HT 2 AR and D 2 R, pointing toward the formation of hetero- 5 -HT 2 AR/D 2 R dimers and homo- 5 -HT 2 AR/ 5 -HT 2 AR dimers. Moreover, the present study investigates the role of specific motifs (one containing adjacent arginine residues (217 RRRRKR 222) in the third intracellular loop (ic 3) of D 2 R, and the other consisting of acidic glutamate residues (454 EE 455) in the C-tail of (5 -HT 2 AR) in the formation of noncovalent complexes between these receptors. Our results suggest that these regions of 5 -HT 2 AR and D 2 R may be involved in the interaction between these two proteins. On the other hand, the above-mentioned motifs do not {{play an important role in}} the homo-dimerization of these receptors. Furthermore, we estimated the influence of specific receptor ligands on the dimerization processes. Agonists (DOI and quinpirole) and antagonists (ketanserin and <b>butaclamol)</b> cause different effects on FRET efficiency depending on whether homo- or hetero-complexes are present. These data may have therapeutic implications, since (using the immunofluorescence double labeling protocols) the co-localization of these two receptors was demonstrated in the medial prefrontal cortex and pars reticulate of the substantia nigra of the rat brain...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of serotonergic ligands at human (h) 5 -HT 1 A receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was examined with the selective ‘neutral' 5 -HT 1 A antagonist [3 H]-WAY 100, 635. Its binding was saturable (KD= 0. 056 [*]nM) with a Bmax (3. 65 [*]pmol[*]mg− 1) {{significantly higher than}} that of two other selective 5 -HT 1 A radioligands: the partial agonist, [3 H]-S 15535 (2. 77 [*]pmol[*]mg− 1) and the agonist, [3 H]- 8 -OH-DPAT (2. 02 [*]pmol[*]mg− 1). The influence of GTPγS (100 [*]μM) on the binding affinity of 15 serotonergic agonists, partial agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists was investigated in competition binding experiments with [3 H]-WAY 100, 635. Agonists, including 5 -HT, 8 -OH-DPAT and buspirone, displayed biphasic isotherms which shifted to the right in the presence of GTPγS. In contrast, isotherms of the inverse agonists, methiothepin, (+) <b>butaclamol</b> and spiperone, were shifted to the left in the presence of GTPγS. Unlabelled WAY 100, 635 was the only ligand that was unaffected by GTPγS, consistent with ‘neutral' antagonist properties. The magnitude of affinity changes induced by GTPγS for 13 ligands was highly correlated (r= 0. 98) with their efficacy (positive and negative) previously determined by [35 S]GTPγS binding. In contrast, the napthylpiperazine derivative and high efficacy agonist, S 14506, displayed only a modest GTPγS shift, in accordance with previous indications of ‘atypical' binding properties of this ligand. A further full agonist, S 14671, which is chemically closely-related to S 14506, also displayed a minimal GTPγS shift, underpinning this observation. In conclusion, [3 H]-WAY 100, 635 constitutes a useful neutral antagonist radioligand for the characterization of drug actions at h 5 -HT 1 A receptors. GTPγS-induced affinity changes of agonist and inverse agonist competition isotherms generally correlate well with ligand efficacy, with the notable exception of two chemically-similar agents, S 14506 and S 14671, which are efficacious agonists, yet relatively insensitive to h 5 -HT 1 A receptor/G-protein coupling changes...|$|E
40|$|Acid-addition salts of {{tricyclic}} isoquinolines 2 a/b, 3 a/b, 4 a- 4 c, 5, 6 a/b, 7, 8 a/b, 9 a/b, and 17 a/b {{were studied}} by high-field ^ 1 H NMR in CDCl_ 3 solution. Cis (e. g., 14 and 15 in Figure 1) and trans (e. g., 13) B-C ring-fused structures {{were identified by}} using the vicinal ^ 3 J(CH-NH) coupling constants, which demonstrate a Karplus-like behavior. In some cases, we initially observed a trans form, which converted to a cis A form by N H proton exchange. For 4 c. HBr, the exchange process was slowed by addition of trifluoroacetic acid. In many cases, cis A and cis B structures were preferred in solution. The pendant phenyl group exerted a strong influence on the preferred solution structure. Observation of the initial, unstable trans-fused structures was related to their capture in the solid state and release intact on dissolution. X-ray diffraction {{was performed on the}} HBr salts of 2 a (B-C cis), 2 b (B-C cis), and 4 c (B-C trans). The result for 4 c. HBr confirmed the connection between the initial trans form in solution and the solid state. For 17 b. HCI two conformers, associated with hindered rotation about the bond connecting the 2, 6 -disubstituted phenyl group to the tricyclic array, were detected at ambient probe temperature; however, rotamers were not observed for either of the two forms (trans and cis A) of 17 a. HBr. Two conformers were also found for 16 b. HBr. Temperature-dependent behavior was recorded in the ^ 1 H NMR spectra of 17 b. HBr and 16 b. HBr; the activation free energy for interconversion of conformers was estimated to be in the vicinity of 17 kcal/mol for the former and 14 - 15 kcal/mol for the latter. The ^ 1 H NMR spectrum of <b>butaclamol</b> hydrochloride (20. HC 1), a potent neuroleptic agent, in Me_ 2 SO-d_ 6 revealed two species in a ratio of 81 : 19, which were assigned as trans and cis A forms, respectively. ^ 1 H NMR data for various free bases are also presented and discussed. Empirical force field calculations on three model hydrocarbons are discussed from a perspective of finding an explanation for the configurational/conformational behavior of the bridgehead ammonium salts. Diverse literature examples of structures for protonated bridgehead amines are also discussed.
