5|$|This episode has {{the final}} {{speaking}} appearance of Lionel Hutz, {{five months before}} the death of Phil Hartman. The episode's development {{grew out of a}} desire by the writers to do a show focused on Marge, where her job did not work out. The episode received positive mention in the book I Can't Believe It's a <b>Bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>Better</b> Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, and is featured in the special 2003 DVD release The Simpsons: Risky Business.|$|E
5|$|It {{was written}} by Ron Hauge, {{directed}} by Bob Anderson, and guest starred Alex Trebek as himself. Hauge was inspired to write the episode after learning of an orphanage that had been ripped off. The episode was selected, among other Christmas themed episodes of the series, on an 2005 Christmas special boxed set on DVD. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a <b>Bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>Better</b> Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide criticized the episode as a rehash of older themes, {{but it was also}} described as one of The Simpsons’ more memorable episodes in a review of the 2005 DVD boxed set release.|$|E

50|$|In February 1990, {{they finally}} moved the mosque {{to the current}} <b>bigger</b> site <b>and</b> <b>better</b> {{equipped}} building to accommodate their growing numbers of Muslims located at 11 Jianjun (建軍) Road in Lingya District. Construction started on 17 December 1990, completed in late December 1991 and it was opened on April 1992.|$|R
5|$|Reviews in The Sydney Morning Herald and DVD Movie Guide were favorable, and {{the authors}} of the book I Can't Believe It's a <b>Bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>Better</b> Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide cited Marge's police {{training}} as the highlight of the episode. Contributors to compilation works analyzing The Simpsons from philosophical and cultural perspectives have cited and discussed the episode. Marge's experiences in the episode are compared to the character Rita from the stage comedy Educating Rita by Willy Russell in a literary analysis of the play.|$|E
25|$|Both groups - Draco and the Malfoys and Harry and the Potters - {{take their}} efforts quite seriously, {{especially}} at this juncture. Amidst the fervor {{leading up to}} the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, wizard rockers seem to be drawing <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> crowds, at every show.|$|E
25|$|However, Roddenberry himself preemptively rebuked such an attitude. He {{had hoped}} that Star Trek would go on after his death. As Star Trek was {{constantly}} improved by each following generation, he expected people to look back upon its humble beginnings as just that, the simple beginnings of something much <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>better.</b> Roddenberry clearly never intended Star Trek {{to be limited to}} his work, but to include all the hopefully superior work of future generations.|$|E
50|$|Leading actress Pickford's {{previous}} film Little Lord Fauntleroy flopped critically. Pickford {{realized she}} had to make a movie the audience loved to see her in. She wanted to play the role again, because she loved the character and stated the crew had more abilities with a <b>bigger</b> budget <b>and</b> <b>better</b> technology.|$|R
50|$|In {{its first}} two years of production, the R6 was criticised by the press for the R4-derived engine's lack of power in the heavier R6. In part because of this, the R6 had worse fuel economy than the larger and {{outdated}} Renault 8, which had a <b>bigger</b> engine <b>and</b> <b>better</b> performance as well.|$|R
50|$|The Chancellor's {{official}} residence, since 1828, is No. 11 Downing Street. In 1997, {{the then}} First and Second Lords, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown respectively, swapped apartments, as the Chancellor's apartment in No. 11 was <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> thus <b>better</b> {{suited to the}} needs of Blair (who had children living with him, including one born during his tenure) than Brown who was at that stage unmarried.|$|R
25|$|The ensuing {{century of}} general peace saw {{considerable}} technological development, with sail yielding to steam and cannon supplanted by large shell-firing guns, {{and ending with}} the race to construct <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> battleships. That race, however, was ultimately a dead end, as aircraft carriers and submarines {{came to the fore}} and, after the successes of World War II, the Royal Navy yielded its formerly preeminent place to the United States Navy. The Royal Navy has remained one of the world's most capable navies, however, and currently operates a fleet of modern ships.|$|E
25|$|Both termini began life as fairly modest affairs, but {{in order}} to cope with {{increasing}} demands both went on to much <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> things in later years, a new Potsdamer Bahnhof, destined to be Berlin's busiest station, opening on 30 August 1872 and a new Anhalter Bahnhof, destined to be the city's biggest and finest, following on 15 June 1880. This latter station benefitted greatly from the closure of a short-lived third terminus in the area– the Dresdner Bahnhof, located south of the Landwehrkanal, which lasted from 17 June 1875 until 15 October 1882.|$|E
25|$|In 1894 {{while he}} was living in Glendalough, he bought a Dublin Bay Water Wag, a 13-foot type of sailing boat usually sailed in Dun Laoghaire, pear-shaped with a single gaff-rigged sail. He sailed this boat on Lough Dan, close to Glendalough, and he and his brother Henry used to take friends for a sail in the Water Wag. <b>Bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> boats followed: by 1895 he was taking the half-deck Marguerite across the Channel and in 1897 there was a long cruise to the Frisian Islands, Norderney and the Baltic with Henry in the thirty-foot cutter Vixen: a voyage he {{repeated}} in the following spring.|$|E
40|$|The 2015 Nobel Prize {{in physics}} {{has been awarded}} to Takaaki Kajita and Arthur McDonald "for the {{discovery}} of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass". Takaaki Kajita of Tokyo University is a Japanese physicist, known for neutrino experiments at the Kamiokande and its successor, Super-Kamiokande. This volume of collected works of Kajita on neutrino oscillations provides a good glimpse into {{as well as a}} record of the rise and the role of Asian research in the frontiers of neutrino physics. Japan is now a major force {{in the study of the}} 3 families of neutrinos. Much remains to be done to clarify the Dirac vs. Majorana nature of the neutrino, and the cosmological implications of the neutrino. The collected works of Kajita and his Super-Kamiokande group will leave an indelible foot-print in the history of <b>big</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> science...|$|R

2500|$|Tracht {{went through}} a string of {{stations}} including WAXC in Rochester, New York, WRC in Washington, D.C., and WPOP in Hartford, Connecticut. He lost his job at WPOP when that station switched its format from pop music to all news in 1975. [...] None of the jobs lasted very long because he was constantly looking for <b>bigger</b> audiences <b>and</b> <b>better</b> time slots. The frequent moves {{from city to city}} were a major reason for the end of his first marriage, after less than two years.|$|R

Fitzgerald was able to persuade businesses and the Massachusetts legislature to invest $9 million for improvements to the port by 1912.

500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a <b>Bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>Better</b> Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "one of the most dismally unfunny episodes ever, lifted only by the brief {{appearance}} of a talking camel and Homer's clever way of getting Cooder and Spud out of his home. Whereas most of the series' politically incorrect moments are funny and well-observed, this episode {{seems to be saying}} that fairground folk and travelers really are deeply unpleasant criminals who are both irredeemable and unworthy of help. Nasty-taste-in-the-mouth time." [...] Despite the negative review from I Can't Believe It's a <b>Bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>Better</b> Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Isaac Mitchell-Frey of the Herald Sun described the episode as [...] "brilliant", and highlighted it along with episodes [...] "The Trouble with Trillions" [...] and [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] and it has been described by the other Simpsons writers in the DVD audio commentary as [...] "criminally underrated".|$|E
500|$|Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors}} of the book I Can't Believe It's a <b>Bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>Better</b> Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, disliked the episode, writing that it was [...] "very dull" [...] and that Dafoe was not used well.

40|$|Swedish survey-evidence {{indicates}} that variables reflecting self-interest {{are important in}} explaining people’s preferred speed limits, and that political preferences adapt to technological development. Drivers of cars that are newer (<b>and</b> hence safer), <b>bigger,</b> <b>and</b> with <b>better</b> high-speed characteristics, prefer higher speed limits, as do those who believe they drive better than average, whereas elderly people prefer lower limits. Furthermore, people report that they themselves vote more sociotropically than they believe others to vote, on average. Self-serving biases are proposed as a bridge between subjectively perceived expressive and sociotropic voting behavior, versus objectively self-interested voting behavior...|$|R
5000|$|An aired {{opinion was}} that Susning's {{status as a}} one-man project on the {{technical}} side was a big aberration. Some meant that divided responsibility of the site probably would've meant increased innovation tact, <b>bigger</b> predictability <b>and</b> <b>better</b> communication between technicians and [...] "susare". Lars Aronsson clarified that he saw Susning.nu as his own project {{and that he was}} not interested in letting others control it.

Failure to please their captors meant demotion and loss of privileges - and an almost certain death at the hands of their fellow inmates.|$|R
