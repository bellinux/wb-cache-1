40|$|The present paper aims at characterising Alpine {{anomalous}} basin-fan systems, {{in order}} to develop a method for hazard assessment for such fans. The review of previous studies revealed that anomalous basin-fan systems are often associated with deep-seated slope failure and present-day hazard is associated to debris flow occurrence. Taking into account these peculiarities, a modelling approach to assess the present day hazard in anomalous fans has been developed and applied to the Sernio fan (Valtellina, northern Italy). Debris flow inundation areas have been simulated by means of a numerical model (RApid Mass MovementS (RAMMS) debris flow), which includes a routine for the sediment entrainment. The range of the model parameters was defined based on previous studies, enabling a sensitivity analysis on the debris flow runout, as well as the flow height and velocity. Numerical results point out the paramount importance of entrainment phenomena on debris flow dynamic in anomalous systems, especially with reference to the <b>bulking</b> <b>factor</b> and debris yield rate that reach very high values, typical of basins with unlimited solid supply...|$|E

The results showed that, the sub key stratum 1 (SKS 1), which commonly {{played a major role in}} mining face strata behaviour, had broken before the first weighting. And because of its high horizontal distance above the coal seam, its long breakage interval, as well as the large <b>bulking</b> <b>factor</b> of the immediate roof, its breakage did not have influence on the mining face. Therefore, the reason for the unusual weighting intensity of first weighting was not because of the breakage of SKS 1 but due to the fracturing of the upper primary key strata (PKS). Also, as PKS was far away from the coal seam, its breakage had only little influence on mining face so that the weighting intensity was quite weak...|$|E

The objective of this work was to determine material stiffness properties of the gob for use in numerical models of rock mass response to longwall mining, Photographs of actual mine gob were digitized to obtain approximate particle size gradations of gob material. The gradation curve was shifted down to a laboratory scale, and 20 uniaxial compression tests were conducted. Varying the maximum particle size was not found to affect the stress-strain behavior, but changing the gradation appeared to influence the stress-strain behavior. The stress-strain relationship of the simulated gob material was nonlinear, the stress-secant-modulus relationship was approximately linear, and the stress-tangent-modulus relationship was approximately a second-order polynomial function. Equations were generated from these curves, providing numerical modelers with a means to estimate gob moduli based on the stress level. In addition, the experimental data were statistically evaluated using multiple regression analyses, producing a series of equations to predict the secant and tangent moduli from the given stress level, <b>bulking</b> <b>factor,</b> rock strength, and thickness-to-width shape ratio of the particles...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} multi-hazard {{approach}} to analyse the 9 September 2010 flash flood in the Dragone basin, a 9  km 2 catchment located along the Amalfi rocky coastal range, southern Italy. In this area, alluvial fan flooding {{has been the most}} frequent and destructive geologic hazard since Roman times. Sudden torrents of water (flash floods) are caused by high-intensity and very localized cloudbursts of short duration, inducing slope erosion and sediment delivery from slope to stream. The elevated bed load transport produces fast-moving hyperconcentrated flows with significant catastrophic implications for communities living at the stream mouth. The 9 September 2010 rainstorm event lasted 1  h with an intensity rainfall peak of nearly 120  mm h − 1. High topographic relief of the Amalfi coastal range and positive anomalies of the coastal waters conditioned the character of the convective system. Based on geological data and post-event field evidence and surveys, as well as homemade videos and eyewitness accounts, it is reported that the flash flood mobilized some 25   000  m 3 of materials with a total (water and sediment) peak flow of 80  m 3  s − 1.

40|$|Radio-loud active galactic nuclei {{are among}} the most {{powerful}} objects in the universe. In these objects, most of the emission comes from relativistic jets getting their power from the accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes. However, despite the number of studies, a jet's acceleration to relativistic speeds is still poorly understood. It is widely known that jets contain relativistic particles that emit radiation through several physical processes, one of them being the inverse Compton scattering of photons coming from external sources. In the case of a plasma composed of electrons and positrons continuously heated by the turbulence, inverse Compton scattering can lead to relativistic bulk motions through the Compton rocket effect. We investigate this process and compute the resulting <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> in the complex photon field of an AGN composed of several external photon sources. We consider various sources here: the accretion disk, the dusty torus, and the broad line region.

We find that for reasonable choices of parameters, photons {{in the range}} of 10 ’s to 100 ’s of GeV may be emitted in the prompt phase. Photons above this range are subject to electron-positron pair production with fireball photons and would be absent from the spectrum escaping the gamma-ray burst.

The maximum distance to and the average redshift of the gamma-ray bursts are strongly affected by the beaming-induced luminosity function. The bursts with the angle-dependent Lorentz factor which peaks at the center of the cone have substantially higher average gamma-ray burst redshifts.

The relativistic motion {{is characterized by}} 2 quantities: the speed or <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> of the outflow, and the angle subtended by the outflow direction and the line of sight to the observer. One combination of these yields the Doppler factor of the outflow, and a different combination yields the apparent (sometimes superluminal) speed with which a feature {{moves away from the}} core. Since there are two observed quantities, the Doppler factor and the apparent velocity, the two unknowns, the <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> and the outflow angle, can be estimated separately. Thus, the <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> and the outflow angle can be estimated separately for a source that has an estimate of both the Doppler factor and an apparent velocity, assuming that the apparent velocity is due to physical motion rather than a pattern speed. Two key results are presented in this paper. First, equipartition Doppler factors have been estimated for a sample of 105 sources with previously estimated inverse Compton Doppler factors. The different categories of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have different ranges and typical values of the Doppler factor; lobe dominated AGN tend to have low Doppler factors, core-dominated quasars tend to have large Doppler factors, and BL Lacertae objects span the full range of Doppler factors. These results support the “orientation unified model ” for different categories of AGN. The second key result comes from combining equipartition Doppler factors and apparent velocities from superluminal motion studies. There are 43 sources for which apparent speeds and equipartition Doppler factors are available. The <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> and outflow angle are estimated for each of these 43 sources. Again, typical parameter values for different categories of AGN are quite interesting, and generally agree with expectations based on the orientation unified model. 1...|$|R

We find these constraints {{to be consistent with}} the speculation that the optical light is emission from the reverse shock component of the external shock. In addition, we find the implied value of M_jet to be in accordance with theoretical estimates: the baryonic loading is sufficiently small to allow acceleration of the outflow to Gamma > 100.

40|$|The polarimetric {{measurement}} on the prompt phase of GRB 100826 A {{shows that the}} polarization angle changes ∼ 90 ^∘ between two adjacent time intervals. We will show that this phenomenon can be naturally interpreted {{in the framework of}} the magnetic-dominated jet (MDJ) model. The MDJ model suggests that the <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> of the outflow increases as Γ∝ r^ 1 / 3, until reaching a saturated value Γ_ sat. Electrons move in the globally ordered magnetic field advected by the jet from the central engine and produce synchrotron photons. The polarized synchrotron photons travel alone the jet direction and then collide with the cold electrons {{at the front of the}} jet. After the Compton scattering process, these photons escape from the jet and are detected by the observer locating slightly off-axis. If photons are emitted before the <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> saturates, the change of polarization angle is a natural result of the acceleration of the outflow.

40|$|We investigate, {{independently}} of specific emission models, the {{constraints on the}} value of the <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> Gamma of a fireball. We assume that the burst emission comes from internal shocks in a region transparent to Thomson scattering and before deceleration due to the swept up external matter is effective. We consider the role of Compton drag in decelerating fast moving shells before they interact with slower ones, thus limiting the possible differences in <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> of shells. Tighter constraints on the possible range of Gamma are derived by requiring that the internal shocks transform more than a few per cent of the bulk energy into radiation. Efficient bursts may require a hierarchical scenario, where a shell undergoes multiple interactions with other shells. We conclude that fireballs with average Lorentz factors larger than 1000 are unlikely to give rise to the observed bursts.
