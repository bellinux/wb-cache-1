5|$|Some millipedes are {{considered}} household pests, including Xenobolus carnifex which can infest thatched roofs in India, and Ommatoiulus moreleti, which periodically invades homes in Australia. Other species exhibit periodical swarming behaviour, which {{can result in}} home invasions, crop damage, and train delays when the tracks become slippery with the crushed remains of hundreds of millipedes. Some millipedes can cause significant damage to crops: the spotted snake millipede (Blaniulus guttulatus) is a noted pest of sugar <b>beets</b> <b>and</b> other root crops, {{and as a result}} {{is one of the few}} millipedes with a common name.|$|E
5|$|Another survivor, Radomir Krnjajić, {{recalled}} {{that they were}} fed a variety of foods, including pumpkin soup, cucumbers, <b>beets</b> <b>and</b> similar vegetables, and sometimes received a little macaroni or beans, but very little bread. The historian Ivan Fumić concludes that the children were systematically punished for various infractions, and were treated harshly by the Ustaše {{and the majority of}} the nuns. Some of the nuns at the camp, however, did show love and attention to the children. Gojko Knežević, another camp survivor, recounted many years later that the nuns beat the children with birch branches dipped in salt water or vinegar.|$|E

5|$|The {{coastline}} supplies many crustaceans, sea bass, monkfish and herring. Normandy has {{top quality}} seafood, such as scallops and sole, while Brittany has {{a supply of}} lobster, crayfish and mussels. Normandy {{is home to a}} large population of apple trees; apples are often used in dishes, as well as cider and Calvados. The northern areas of this region, especially Nord, grow ample amounts of wheat, sugar <b>beets</b> <b>and</b> chicory. Thick stews are found often in these northern areas as well. The produce of these northern regions is also considered some {{of the best in the}} country, including cauliflower and artichokes. Buckwheat grows widely in Brittany as well and is used in the region's galettes, called jalet, which is where this dish originated.|$|E
5|$|The {{common earwig}} is an omnivore, eating plants and ripe fruit {{as well as}} {{actively}} hunting arthropods. To a large extent, this species is also a scavenger, feeding on decaying plant and animal matter if given the chance. Observed prey include largely plant lice, but also large insects such as bluebottle flies and woolly aphids. Plants that they feed on typically include clover, dahlias, zinnias, butterfly bush, hollyhock, lettuce, cauliflower, strawberry, blackberry, sunflowers, celery, peaches, plums, grapes, potatoes, roses, seedling beans and <b>beets,</b> <b>and</b> tender grass shoots and roots; they have also been known to eat corn silk, damaging the corn.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{upon his}} arrival in Germany, Accum went {{to the town of}} Althaldensleben. There, the {{industrialist}} Johann Gottlob Nathusius had acquired various estates and was using them to found a sprawling industrial settlement. Nathusius was a German pioneer in the field of sugar production from <b>beets,</b> <b>and</b> had established a factory for its production in that town between 1813 and 1816. It was probably Nathusius’ extensive library and chemical laboratory that drew Accum. He remained only a short time in Althaldensleben, however, as he soon got a professorship at the Gewerbeinstitut and the Bauakademie in Berlin. His teaching in the areas of physics, chemistry, and mineralogy, were collected in the two volume work, Physische und chemische Beschaffenheit der Baumaterialien, deren Wahl, Verhalten und zweckmässige Anwendung, published in Berlin in 1826. It was the only work Accum published originally in German.|$|E

It is also a large producer of potatoes, wheat and grain (and grain legumes).|$|R

25|$|Šaltibarščiai - cold borscht is {{a summer}} soup based on <b>beets</b> <b>and</b> milk kefir or sour milk, colored a {{shocking}} pink. It {{is made with}} cooked or pickled shredded <b>beets</b> <b>and</b> various other chopped vegetables, such as cucumber, dill, or green onions. Hot boiled potatoes, cold sour cream, and diced hard-boiled eggs are often served alongside to add color, texture, and thermal contrast.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} glyphosate-resistant crops, GM sugar beet farming may {{contribute}} to the growing number of glyphosate-resistant weeds. GM Corn, GM soybeans and GM cotton are grown on many times the acreage devoted to sugar <b>beets</b> <b>and</b> these crops are most affected.|$|E

25|$|The region {{also has}} a {{thriving}} agricultural sector, which produces cereals (wheat, rye, barley, oats, corn), potatoes, rapeseed, sugar <b>beets</b> <b>and</b> others.

40|$|Abolishment of EU sugar quotas {{will lead}} to lower sugar <b>and</b> sugar <b>beet</b> prices in the EU, leading to lower margins for farms. At the same time, {{expansion}} of sugar <b>beet</b> growing <b>and</b> processing in a quota-free situation can decrease fixed cost per ha of sugar <b>beet</b> <b>and</b> per kg of sugar, making both sugar <b>beet</b> growing <b>and</b> processing more efficient. Besides, lower sugar price levels will make Europe a more attractive continent for investments by sugar-based industries...|$|R
25|$|Allensworth's economy {{depended}} on agriculture; farmers cultivated alfalfa, wheat, sugar <b>beets,</b> <b>and</b> cotton; and raised dairy cattle, chickens, turkeys, and Belgian hares. The town had several businesses and public buildings: bakery, drugstore, livery stable, barbershop, church, school, library, and a machine shop. Sources {{such as the}} Oakland Sunshine, a leading black Oakland, California newspaper in 1913, claimed that Allensworth generated nearly $5,000 monthly in its business ventures.|$|E
25|$|Sugar cane tolerates hot climates better, but the {{production}} of sugar cane needs approximately {{four times as much}} water as {{the production}} of sugar beet. As a result, some countries that traditionally produced cane sugar (such as Egypt) have built new beet sugar factories since about 2008. Some sugar factories process both sugar cane and sugar <b>beets</b> <b>and</b> extend their processing period in that way.|$|E
25|$|Most {{frequently}} {{occurring in}} nature are the glycosides of cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, and petunidin. Roughly 2% of all hydrocarbons fixed in photosynthesis are converted into flavonoids and their derivatives, {{such as the}} anthocyanins. Not all land plants contain anthocyanin; in the Caryophyllales (including cactus, <b>beets,</b> <b>and</b> amaranth), they are replaced by betalains. Anthocyanins and betalains have never {{been found in the}} same plant.|$|E
