5|$|Where {{the shot}} is {{tracking}} with Superman as he flies (such {{as in the}} Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended {{in front of a}} <b>background</b> <b>image</b> dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back at many times the original intensity directly into a combined camera/projector. The result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.|$|E
5|$|The scenes Ubisoft removed depict anal probing by {{aliens and}} the player-character {{performing}} an abortion. In their place, the game displays a still {{image of a}} statue holding its face in its hand, with an explicit description of events depicted in the scene. In Australia, the same scenes were removed because the Australian Classification Board refused to rate the game for release due to the depiction of sexual violencespecifically the child player-character being subjected to anal probing and the interactive abortion scene. Like the European version, these scenes were replaced with a placeholder card with an explanation of what was removed on a <b>background</b> <b>image</b> of a koala crying.|$|E

25|$|The {{retirement}} of Peter Sissons and departure of Michael Buerk from the Ten O'Clock News led {{to changes in}} the BBC One bulletin presenting team on 20 January 2003. The Six O'Clock News became double headed with George Alagiah and Sophie Raworth after Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce moved to present the Ten. At the time of the changes, a new set design featuring a projected <b>background</b> <b>image</b> of a fictional newsroom was introduced. New programme titles were introduced on 16 February 2004 to match those of BBC News 24.|$|E
500|$|Sheriff Ethan {{is portrayed}} by Mitchell Kosterman in {{seventeen}} episodes spanning seasons one and two. Kosterman's first scene as Ethan came in [...] "Jitters", which was originally {{scheduled to be}} the third episode of season one but was pushed back to eighth. Season one's [...] "Rogue" [...] introduced the idea Sheriff Ethan had a history with Jonathan, {{and it was that}} moment that Kosterman felt like he was more than a <b>background</b> <b>image</b> for the show. That history was used against Jonathan in season two's [...] "Suspect", when Ethan framed him for the attempted murder of Lionel Luthor. Ethan's subterfuge was discovered by Clark and Pete, who set up a scheme of their own to bring Ethan's action to light, which resulted in Ethan's surrender and arrest.|$|E
500|$|The damaged bus was not {{the only}} problem to filming in Dubai: the first of the three days was afflicted by a {{sandstorm}} which left most of the footage shot unusable. The production team then struggled to complete three days of filming in two days; the last day was compared to [...] "filming Lawrence of Arabia". To complete the episode's filming, interior scenes in the bus were filmed in a studio in Wales. To disguise the fact they were using a translite, a 360-degree <b>background</b> <b>image,</b> Strong utilised often-avoided techniques such as muddied windows and lens flares; the latter also served to create a warmer environment for the viewer. After filming ended, editing and post-processing took place until two days before transmission, leaving the BBC to resort to using an unfinished copy to market the episode.|$|E

500|$|The stage show {{included}} new choreography, {{as well as}} Victoria Halkiti and Nektarios Georgiadis as backing vocalists. Kalomoira {{started off}} the show sitting on a diamond sequenced bench held up by her dancers. She then got down and started a dance routine with complex choreography. There was also a large purple book on stage that opened up as a heart shaped pop-up book that Kalomoira stepped out of when she sang the lyrics [...] "an open book". In time with the book opening, Kalomoira removed her pink dress revealing a pink and silver mini-dress underneath. Toward {{the middle of the}} song during the break, the cameras cut to Kalomoira who was doing a provocative dance; shaking her whole body. At the end of the song, she was slightly lifted up by her dancers. The <b>background</b> <b>image</b> on stage was a skyline of buildings that moved with glowing lights. She wore clothes exclusively by JLO and managed to finish in first place out of nineteen countries, receiving 156 points.|$|E

2500|$|September 28, 2004: A revised {{design was}} implemented, as Series 2004, {{with the first}} use of {{multiple}} colors since the 1905 $20 Gold Certificate. Around the new border-less portrait of Ulysses Grant appears a subtle, stylized blue and red <b>background</b> <b>image</b> of the American Flag. A small silver-blue star was also added to the lower right of Grant's portrait. All previous Series 1996 security features were included, although the color-shifting numeric 50 now shifts from copper to green.

2500|$|Traffic-flow {{measurement}} and {{automatic incident detection}} using video cameras is another form of vehicle detection. [...] Since video detection systems such as those used in automatic number plate recognition do not involve installing any components directly into the road surface or roadbed, this type of system {{is known as a}} [...] "non-intrusive" [...] method of traffic detection. [...] Video from cameras is fed into processors that analyse the changing characteristics of the video image as vehicles pass. [...] The cameras are typically mounted on poles or structures above or adjacent to the roadway. [...] Most video detection systems require some initial configuration to [...] "teach" [...] the processor the baseline <b>background</b> <b>image.</b> [...] This usually involves inputting known measurements such as the distance between lane lines or the height of the camera above the roadway. [...] A single video detection processor can detect traffic simultaneously from one to eight cameras, depending on the brand and model. The typical output from a video detection system is lane-by-lane vehicle speeds, counts, and lane occupancy readings. [...] Some systems provide additional outputs including gap, headway, stopped-vehicle detection, and wrong-way vehicle alarms.|$|E
