25|$|Another recent {{development}} in revolver {{technology is the}} Rhino, a revolver introduced by Italian manufacturer Chiappa in 2009 and first sold in the U.S. in 2010. The Rhino, built with the U.S. concealed carry market in mind, is designed so that the bullet fires from the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber</b> of the cylinder instead of the top chamber as in standard revolvers. This is intended to reduce muzzle flip, allowing for faster and more accurate repeat shots. In addition, the cylinder cross-section is hexagonal instead of circular, further reducing the weapon's profile.|$|E
2500|$|Examples {{of famous}} [...] "real" [...] {{staircases}} in England are Bingley and Grindley Brook. Two-rise staircases are more common: Snakeholme Lock and Struncheon Hill Lock on the Driffield Navigation {{were converted to}} staircase locks after low water levels hindered navigation over the bottom cill at all but the higher tides – the new <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber</b> rises just far {{enough to get the}} boat over the original lock cill. In China, the recently completed Three Gorges Dam includes a double five-step staircase for large ships, and a ship lift for vessels of less than 3000 metric tons. Examples of [...] "apparent" [...] staircases are Foxton Locks and Watford Locks on the Leicester Branch of the Grand Union.|$|E
2500|$|The Native American flute is {{the only}} flute in the world {{constructed}} with two air chambers - there is a wall inside the flute between the top (slow) air chamber and the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber</b> which has the whistle and finger holes. The top chamber {{also serves as a}} secondary resonator, which gives the flute its distinctive sound. There is a hole {{at the bottom of the}} [...] "slow" [...] air chamber and a (generally) square hole at the top of the playing chamber. A block (or [...] "bird") with a spacer is tied on top of the flute to form a thin, flat airstream for the whistle hole (or [...] "window"). Some more modern flutes use an undercut either in the block or the flute to eliminate the need for a spacer.|$|E

The two large, external tubes at the near end, and another pair at the far end, passed cooler water from the top chamber to the two <b>bottom</b> <b>chambers,</b> thereby enhancing circulation.|$|R
30|$|The wheel {{assemblies}} are {{coupled to}} each other by the HIS system. In the body bounce motion shown in Figure  1, the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chambers</b> are compressed and extended, respectively. Owing to the asymmetry of the hydraulic cylinders, every hydraulic circuit contains {{a small amount of}} fluid flowing into the accumulators. This leads to a small pressure change in the two hydraulic circuits. Thus, the actuators could generate an additional hydraulic force to restrict the bounce motion of the sprung mass relative to the unsprung mass. In the body pitch motion, all the front and rear suspensions are compressed and extended, respectively. The front and rear cylinder bodies move downward and upward relative to the piston rod, respectively. It reduces the volume of the front top and rear <b>bottom</b> <b>chambers,</b> and simultaneously increases the volume of the front bottom and rear top chambers. Thus, the fluid in circuit B flows into the corresponding accumulator B, and the fluid in the corresponding accumulator A flows into circuit A. Consequently, the pressures in circuits A and B are increased and decreased, respectively. It in return generates the large pitch restoring moment to prevent the vehicle body pitch motion relative to the unsprung mass.|$|R
2500|$|A [...] "real" [...] {{staircase}} can {{be thought}} of as a [...] "compressed" [...] flight, where the intermediate pounds have disappeared, and the upper gate of one lock is also the lower gate of the one above it. However, it is incorrect to use the terms staircase and flight interchangeably: because of the absence of intermediate pounds, operating a staircase is very different from operating a flight. It can be more useful to think of a staircase as a single lock with intermediate levels (the top gate is a normal top gate, and the intermediate gates are all as tall as the bottom gate). As there is no intermediate pound, a chamber can only be filled by emptying the one above, or emptied by filling the one below: thus the whole staircase has to be full of water (except for the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber)</b> before a boat starts to ascend, or empty (except for the top chamber) before a boat starts to descend. By building a pair of such lock sets (one used to climb and the other to descend) these difficulties are avoided, as well as enabling a greater traffic volume and reduced wait times.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber</b> {{contains}} the water. The middle chamber is a filter-basket holding the ground coffee and sits within the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber.</b> The top chamber, {{with a metal}} filter, screws onto the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber.</b> When the pot is heated on a stove, the pressure from the steam in the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber</b> forces the water through a tube into the filter-basket, through the ground coffee, the metal filter, and it then funnels into the top chamber where the coffee is then ready to serve. They are commonly found in Italy, Spain and Portugal. They are {{also known as a}} macchinetta, Italian for little machine or caffettiera, Italian for coffee maker.|$|E

5000|$|The Norwegian Landstad revolver, {{designed}} and introduced in 1900. Its very unusual design featured a flat cylinder with two chambers, {{in which the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber</b> was loaded from a sideways-inserted magazine that also functioned as the left grip plate. During firing, the revolver's reciprocating bolt would extract and eject the round from the top chamber after firing, load a round into the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber,</b> and then rotate the cylinder. The revolver would then be ready to fire again. It was chambered for the 7.5mm Nagant cartridge, {{which at the time}} was also used in both the Norwegian and Swedish versions of the Belgian Nagant M1895 revolver.|$|E
50|$|The {{heat source}} under the {{percolator}} (such as a range or stove) heats {{the water in}} the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber.</b> Water at the very bottom of the chamber gets hot first and starts to boil. The boiling makes bubbles rise up and push water up the vertical tube then out the top of the vertical tube. From the top of the tube, the water flows out and over the lid of the coffee chamber. Perforations in the lid distribute the water {{over the top of the}} coffee grounds. The water then seeps through the coffee grounds then through the bottom of the coffee chamber. From the bottom of the coffee chamber, the water drops onto the colder water at the top of the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber,</b> helping to force water up the tube. This whole cycle repeats continuously.|$|E

Two hundred micrograms of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -Amino or Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -Tat NPs was added into the apical chambers and incubated for 24  h. Then, each well was irradiated with external magnetic field for varied periods (0, 0.5, 2, and 8  h). RPMI 1640 medium {{was used as the}} blank control. After removing external magnetic field, the NPs were added and incubated for another 26  h. TEER of monolayer was detected in the interval of 1  h and a plot of the TEER—time curve was made. After washing with PBS, the hCMEC cells for each variable (NPs only, NPs[*]+[*]magnet and irradiation time) were lysed and transportation efficiency was assessed through determining the ratio of the element Fe in <b>bottom</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Transient {{response}} of an adsorbing or non-adsorbing tracer injected as step or square pulse input in a diffusion cell with two flowing streams across the pellet is theoretically investigated in this paper. Exact solutions and the asymptotic solutions {{in the time}} domain and in three different limits are obtained by using an integral transform technique and a singular perturbation technique, respectively. Parametric dependence of the concentrations in the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chambers</b> can be revealed by investigating the asymptotic solutions, which are far simpler than their exact counterpart. In the time domain investigation, {{it is found that}} the bottom-chamber concentration is very sensitive to the value of the macropore effective diffusivity. Therefore this concentration could be used to extract diffusivity by fitting in the time domain. The bottom-chamber concentration is also sensitive to flow rate, pellet length chamber volume and the type of input (step and square input) ...|$|R
50|$|The iconic Moka pot {{coffee maker}} {{functions}} {{on the same}} principle but the water is forced up from the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber</b> through a third middle chamber containing the coffee grounds to the top chamber which has an air gap to prevent the brewed coffee from returning downwards.

50|$|The spider {{is found}} in long, deep burrows (closed with a double flap typical of the Chilean Lycinus) in sandy, desertic locations. The {{internal}} burrow's lining forms a dense, thick tube which prevents sand from collapsing. The burrows are typically between 20 and 25 mm wide. They start a vertical path, becoming more horizontal after approximately 25 cm, widening at a <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{apparatus}} {{is usually}} made of glass, or sometimes of polyethylene, {{and consists of}} three vertically stacked chambers, roughly resembling a snowman. The upper chamber extends downward as a tube that passes through the middle chamber into the lower chamber. There is no direct path between {{the middle and upper}} chambers, but the middle chamber is separated from the lower chamber by a retention plate, such as a conical piece of glass with small holes, which permits the passage of liquid and gas. The solid material (e.g., iron sulfide) is placed into the middle chamber in lumps sufficiently large to avoid falling through the retention plate. The liquid, such as an acid, is poured into the top chamber. Although the acid is free to flow down through the tube into the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber,</b> it is prevented from rising there by the pressure of the gas contained above it, which is able to leave the apparatus only by a stopcock {{near the top of the}} middle chamber. This stopcock may be opened, initially to permit the air to leave the apparatus, allowing the liquid in the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber</b> to rise through the retention plate into the middle chamber and react with the solid material. Gas is evolved from this reaction, which may be drawn off through the stopcock as desired. When the stopcock is closed, the pressure of the evolved gas in the middle chamber rises and pushes the acid back down into the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber,</b> until it is not in contact with the solid material anymore. At that point the chemical reaction comes to a stop, until the stopcock is opened again and more gas is drawn off.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} cause of blue baby syndrome, and the one which was the subject of the classic [...] "blue baby operation" [...] {{developed}} at Johns Hopkins in the 1940s, is tetralogy of Fallot. In the normal heart, there are four separate chambers; the two top chambers, or atria, pump blood simultaneously into the two <b>bottom</b> <b>chambers,</b> or ventricles. Blood first enters the heart at the right atrium, which then empties blood into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood into the lungs through the pulmonary artery to get oxygen. From the lungs, the blood enters the left atrium through the pulmonary vein; the left atrium empties into the left ventricle, which pumps the blood into the aorta and from there reaches the rest of the body. Because the left ventricle is responsible for getting blood to the entire body through the aorta, it is usually the biggest and strongest chamber of the heart.|$|R

5000|$|Most tremolo harmonicas {{are built}} upon what is termed the [...] "Wiener system", {{named after the}} city of Vienna (Wien in Austria) where they first emerged. In this design the two beating reeds are {{distributed}} one on each reed-plate (top and bottom) and these share a common chamber. In practice, however, {{it is common for}} each individual reed to have its own air chamber. Unlike the standard ten-hole harmonicas (built on the [...] "Richter system", e.g. Hohner's Marine Band) the blow and draw reeds do not share a common chamber, but are separated off from one another. This allows the player to isolate each reed. While normally the player simply plays both the tremolo reeds at once, it is possible to achieve a wide variety of bends and other effects through selecting certain reeds and chambers and not others. Similarly, it is possible to play without the tremolo effect by only choosing the top or <b>bottom</b> <b>chambers</b> and blocking off the others with the lips. In practice, though, these are primarily used for effects and mostly the instrument is played as if the two beating reeds shared a single chamber.|$|R
5000|$|For {{studies of}} {{hydration}} {{at very high}} relative humidities, a special modification of the method of sorption calorimetry - the desorption calorimetric method [...] - was developed. A desorption experiment starts with a fully hydrated sample which {{is placed in the}} sample chamber (the top chamber in the figure). In the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber</b> a salt solution is injected. During the desorption experiment the sample is being slowly dehydrated and the salt solution takes up the water evaporated from the sample.|$|E
50|$|A {{simplified}} every-day-life {{example of}} a gas-solid fluidized bed would be a hot-air popcorn popper. The popcorn kernels, all being fairly uniform in size and shape, are suspended in the hot air rising from the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber.</b> Because of the intense mixing of the particles, akin {{to that of a}} boiling liquid, this allows for a uniform temperature of the kernels throughout the chamber, minimizing the amount of burnt popcorn. After popping, the now larger popcorn particles encounter increased aerodynamic drag which pushes them out of the chamber and into a bowl.|$|E

50|$|The typical {{installation}} of a house-built beam engine spanned four floors. The cylinder and the engine driver's usual working position were located in the 'bottom chamber', approximately at ground level. Above this were the 'middle chamber', with the cylinder top cover and 'top nozzle' (the upper valve chest), and above that the 'top chamber' or beam chamber. The cataracts were located in the lowest part of the engine house, in a chamber below the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber,</b> along with the exhaust pipe. This space was awkward to access and not visited in normal operation.|$|E
50|$|After {{the early}} beam engines, where the {{cylinder}} was mounted directly atop the boiler, the space {{inside the house}} of later beam engines was divided by floors. The 'bottom chamber' contained {{the base of the}} cylinder, the lower valves and the valvegear. This was the main working chamber and was where the engine driver would spend most of their time. Above this, a floor or partial floor and the 'top chamber' provided a working space for access to the valves or 'nozzles' {{at the top of the}} cylinder. This was used mostly for intermittent access to lubricate bearings etc. Often the floor did not span the full length of the house and formed a gallery above the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber.</b> These floors and stairways were often fitted with woodwork and banisters of the highest quality. Similarly the 'beam chamber' at the top of the house provided access to the beam's bearings. Where the beam extended through the end wall of the house, two small outdoor platforms on either side of the beam gave access from the beam chamber to each side of the beam and the bearings for the pump shaft. A final chamber was beneath the floor of the <b>bottom</b> <b>chamber.</b> This contained the air pump and regulating cataract. It was so rarely visited that access was only by means of a trapdoor.|$|E

50|$|Another {{interesting}} note is that Captain Gorham {{visited the}} cave {{during his time}} in Gibraltar alongside his team consisting of Lt. Anderson & Sgt. Mathews. Captain Gorham, {{best known for the}} discovery and naming of Gorham's Cave, was a keen explorer and left an inscription within Judge’s cave marking his visit on 12 December 1906. Having visited the site, we would also {{like to point out that}} there are areas of archaeological deposits which remain ‘un-excavated’ and could very possibly yield more Human remains Judges cave has recently been surveyed to the ‘Grade 6’ level of accuracy by a team of Spanish professional speleologists (Jose & Julio Aguilera) working alongside the Gibraltar Museum’s Team and another survey was carried out separately by the Gibraltar Museum's Caving unit on 12 September 2012. The site has a total depth of 47 meters below the current ground level and a total length of 250 meters. Considering the site is 74 meters above sea level this makes its <b>bottom</b> <b>chambers</b> only 27 meters above sea level. Judge’s Cave is an extensive system based on various levels. At this stage we would like to point out that we do not rule out the possibility that this site may have other large chambers which are yet to be discovered.
