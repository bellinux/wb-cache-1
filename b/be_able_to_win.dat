5|$|Coming {{into the}} weekend, Mercedes had already secured the Constructors' Championship, having done {{so at the}} {{previous}} race in Russia. Ferrari was in second place on 359 points, 139 points ahead of Williams. In the Drivers' Championship, Lewis Hamilton led with 302 points, 66 ahead of Sebastian Vettel and 73 ahead of his teammate, Nico Rosberg. This meant that Hamilton would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the title with three races to spare, {{as long as he}} gathered nine points more than Vettel and two more than Rosberg at the Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of Operation Auca began in September 1955. Saint, McCully, Elliot, and fellow missionary Johnny Keenan decided to {{initiate}} contact with the Huaorani and began periodically searching for them by air. By {{the end of the}} month, they had identified several clearings in the jungle. Meanwhile, Elliot learned several phrases {{in the language of the}} Huaorani from Dayuma, a young Huaorani woman who had left her society and become friends with Rachel Saint, a missionary and the sister of Nate Saint. The missionaries hoped that by regularly giving gifts to the Huaorani and attempting to communicate with them in their language, they would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> them over as friends.|$|E
25|$|Blair's {{apparent}} {{refusal to}} set a date for his departure was criticised by the British press and Members of Parliament. It {{has been reported that}} a number of cabinet ministers believed that Blair's timely departure from office would be required to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a fourth election. Some ministers viewed Blair's announcement of policy initiatives in September 2006 as an attempt to draw attention away from these issues.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} in diagram 4 {{is an example}} of a pawn drawing against a queen. Stalemates of this sort can often save a player from losing an apparently hopeless position (see Queen versus pawn endgame). In that position, even if it were White's move, there is no way to avoid this stalemate without allowing Black's pawn to promote. (White may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the resulting queen versus queen ending, however, if the white king is close enough).|$|E
25|$|The plan to {{organize}} the mill workers led to even fiercer battles with the refinery companies, who paid their workers half what miners earned for a ten- to twelve-hour day. When smelter workers went on strike in Colorado City, Colorado in 1903 it appeared that they might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> their demands without a serious fight, since the Cripple Creek miners were striking in sympathy with their demands. However, {{when one of the}} smelter operators refused to accept the deal brokered by the Governor of Colorado, James Hamilton Peabody, the Governor called in federal troops.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the most}} {{traditional}} version of cricket, with rules most closely replicating the original rules of cricket from the 16th and 17th century. It is a single innings game with a set time limit for the entire game to be completed in. To win the game, a side must both score the highest aggregate number of runs and take all ten of the opposition wickets. It {{is up to the}} side batting first to declare when they feel they have enough runs to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the match. In this format of cricket, if the side batting second do not lose all ten of their wickets, the match is said to have ended in a draw.|$|E

25|$|He {{was still}} in that post when the Yom Kippur War began catastrophically for Israel on 6 October 1973. As the highest-ranking {{official}} responsible for military planning, Dayan may bear part {{of the responsibility for}} the Israeli leadership having missed the signs for the upcoming war. In the hours preceding the war, Dayan chose not to order a full mobilization or a preemptive strike against the Egyptians and Syrians. He assumed that Israel would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> easily even if the Arabs attacked and, more importantly, did not want Israel to appear as the aggressor, as it would have undoubtedly cost it the invaluable support of the United States (who would later mount a massive airlift to rearm Israel).|$|E
25|$|Dimitrije Tucović {{organized}} a rally of dissatisfied workers and students on 23 March 1903 which turned into open {{conflict with the}} police and the army resulting in the deaths of six people. Knowing that he would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> new elections, the king staged two coups within one hour. With the first coup Alexander abolished his octroyed constitution and disbanded the Senate and National Assembly. Then the King appointed new members to the Senate, the State Council and the courts. In the second coup, the King restored the constitution he had abolished just a few hours earlier. Following this, the government conducted elections on 18 May 1903 (31 May by Gregorian calendar) which the government won. This was the final political victory for King Alexander I.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the war, the British Army {{was a small}} {{professional}} army, {{designed to}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> quick victories by using superior mobility and using technology in place of manpower. Nevertheless, its effectiveness was hampered by the doctrine of casualty avoidance, a measure adopted due to the high losses sustained in the First World War (1914–1918). The army knew that British society, and the soldiers themselves, would never again allow them to recklessly throw away lives. There was also a conservative tendency to consolidate gains made on the battlefield instead of aggressively exploiting successes. The structure of the British Army had been organized {{in such a way}} that it sacrificed firepower for mobility and removed from its commanders the fire support weapons that were needed to advance over the battlefield.|$|E

25|$|Blair's {{academic}} performance reports {{suggest that he}} neglected his academic studies, but during his time at Eton he worked with Roger Mynors to produce a College magazine, The Election Times, joined {{in the production of}} other publications – College Days and Bubble and Squeak – and participated in the Eton Wall Game. His parents could not afford to send him to a university without another scholarship, and they concluded from his poor results that he would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> one. Runciman noted that he had a romantic idea about the East, and the family decided that Blair should join the Imperial Police, the precursor of the Indian Police Service. For this he had to pass an entrance examination. His father had retired to Southwold, Suffolk, by this time; Blair was enrolled at a crammer there called Craighurst, and brushed up on his Classics, English, and History. He passed the entrance exam, coming seventh out of the 26 candidates who exceeded the pass mark.|$|E
25|$|A centre forward (main striker) has the key task {{of scoring}} goals {{and for this}} reason acts as {{the focal point of the}} {{majority}} of attacking play by a team. As such, how well a striker is performing tends to be measured purely on goals scored despite the fact that they may be contributing in other ways to a team's success. A traditional centre forward was required to be tall in height and strong physically in order to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the ball in the area from crosses and attempt to score with either their feet or head, or to knock the ball down for a teammate to score. Whilst these assets are still an advantage, in the modern game speed and movement are also required as there is more interplay when attacking. In a 4–4–2 or 4–4–1–1 formation the centre forward is often paired with a second striker who may play around him or in a slightly withdrawn role respectively, though it is not unknown to play two recognised centre forwards.|$|E
25|$|Andrija Hebrang accused his party's dissidents, Vidošević and Primorac, {{as well as}} most right-wing {{candidates}} for 'stealing' his votes saying the result was that two left-wingers would face-off in the second round. Despite this, he called the election a great victory of the right claiming that right-leaning candidates combined achieved better results that left-leaning candidates combined. In making this assertion, he failed to consider Bandić as left-leaning, and ignored Vidošević's appeal to the left-leaning voters as well. Vidošević conceded defeat saying that one should never blame his failures on others, but himself. He urged the public to continue believing in a better tomorrow saying that Croatia should be a country of knowledge and justice, not of corruption and divisiveness. Pusić gave a short teary speech calling Croatia a country with a lot of potential with only the right leadership. She also noted that no government would ever <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> without the support of HNS. Primorac said he would be forming a new party which would be independent from both HDZ and SDP and said he saw a bright future for Croatia.|$|E

25|$|Elsie Leung {{also called}} on the {{government}} to seek an interpretation as soon as possible; based her knowledge of the Court of Final Appeal's reading of the Basic Law in prior cases going back to Director of Immigration v. Chong Fung Yuen in 2001, she did not expect {{that the government would}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> its case in that venue. She further accused both the CFI and the CFA of ignoring the legislative intent of the Basic Law's drafters. On this point, University of Hong Kong law professor Albert Chen, {{also a member of the}} Basic Law Committee, noted that Lam had very little flexibility in how he could rule on Vallejos precisely due to CFA precedents in the Chong Fung Yuen case and other early right of abode cases. He stated that the CFA's reluctance to take into account extrinsic materials in determining the intent of Article 24 stemmed largely from the fact that the extrinsic materials available to the CFA regarding the intent of Article 24 were published after the Basic Law itself. As a solution, he suggested that, if Beijing made public the minutes from the negotiations leading up to the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which was the basis for the drafting of the Basic Law, it might persuade the CFA to re-examine its interpretation of Article 24; the Joint Declaration, being a treaty, was subject to principles of international law, under which signatories to a treaty had the right to issue explanations of their positions.|$|E

500|$|After {{his term}} as governor, Buckner {{returned}} to Glen Lily. In 1895, {{he was one}} of four candidates nominated for a seat in the U.S. Senate— the others being the incumbent, J. C. S. Blackburn; outgoing governor John Y. Brown; and congressman James B. McCreary. The Democratic party split over the issue of bimetalism. Buckner advocated for a gold standard, but the majority of Kentuckians advocated [...] "Free Silver". Seeing that he would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the seat in light of this opposition, he withdrew from the race in July 1895. In spite of his withdrawal, he still received 9of the 134votes cast in the General Assembly.|$|E

Sony also worked with Pringles Potato Crisp, Blu-Tack, Jolly Time Pop Corn, and Nutella. Sony's Vice President of marketing, Jennifer Anderson, stated the studio spend approximately 15% to 25% of its marketing budget on digital ad campaigns; from this, Papa Johns sent text messages to mobile phones with ads.

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and appeared later at a press conference.

He said that after his first pit stop he did not think that he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the race, and praised his team for their work. Da Matta stated that he was worried about his advantage in the points standings and felt he had the car which could win the event. He added that he could not relax because other drivers still had a mathematical chance of clinching the championship, but he was pleased with the result. Third-place finisher Carpentier said he was happy with his position and that it was a good day for his team. He revealed that changes made to his aerodynamic setup worked on the rolling restarts although it slowed him on the backstraight. Franchitti's race engineer Allen McDonald praised his driver, saying his first victory on an oval track was one that he would remember and that it was an [...] "unbelievable day".|$|E
