50|$|In {{response}} to budget pressures, the Survey of Income and Program Participation nearly {{ceased to exist}} in 2006. The survey, then beginning the process to convert the existing instrument format to more modern software, suspended the instrument conversion and prepared to shut down operations. Fortunately, the strident backlash and public petition from the public policy, academic, and partner agency communities led a large contingent of Senators and Representatives from Congress to endorse the petition to request the reinstatement of SIPP’s funding. With funding restored, the US Census Bureau began re-engineering the SIPP. The re-engineering focused on several key goals, including reducing <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>respondents,</b> reducing program costs, improving accuracy, improving timeliness and accessibility, and improving relevance. The SIPP stakeholders and data users have been, and continue to be, critical partners for the SIPP program.|$|E
50|$|The PAI {{is often}} used in {{forensics}} and corrections, where increasing support for its validity has been noted. The PAI {{has a number of}} strengths for applied psychological assessment. First, the 4-point scale contributes to greater scale reliability and validity, as it provides respondents with the opportunity to give nuanced ratings of themselves (as opposed to a true-false scale). Second, it is relatively economical, assessing most of the constructs that are widely considered important in clinical personality assessment with only 344 items. Third, nearly all of the PAI items are readable at the 4th grade level. Brevity and straightforward item wording reduce the administrative <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>respondents.</b> The lower reading level makes it accessible to those with lower levels of intelligence and reading ability. Fourth, the responses from each individual's profile can be compared to multiple large samples. The first sample consists of 1,000 people with similar demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity) to the U.S. Census data. Comparison with this group is useful to detect and estimate the severity of clinical problems relative to the average person. The second sample consists of 1,265 psychiatric patients. Comparison with this group helps assess the severity of psychopathology among other patients. There is also a sample of 1200 offenders from multiple correctional settings and a further sample of 1051 college students.|$|E

In the first section two issues are discussed that are particularly important to consider when designing an effective recall strategy.

Important CEQ Design Features Related to the Recall Period The recall period is related to a number of other aspects of the survey interview, including the <b>burden</b> placed <b>on</b> the <b>respondent,</b> the mode of data collection, the use of proxy reporting and the questionnaire.

40|$|Purpose - The {{divergent}} {{interests of}} franchisor and franchisee {{give rise to}} significant ex-post conflict following {{the purchase of a}} franchise. Australian regulators have sought to assist transparency in franchising decision making by legislating for disclosure documents that expose key variables that theoretically determine choice on the part of prospective franchisees. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the value proposition of the disclosure document and tests its normative effectiveness using a signal-theoretic perspective. Design/methodology/approach - Potential investors were asked to consider selected attributes through a choice-based survey, consistent with consumer theory, and focussing on an attribute-based determination of value. However, complex decision making in general and choice modeling can place severe cognitive <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> <b>respondents</b> and induce satisficing rather than maximizing behavioral patterns. Best-worst scaling (BWS) provided a means for potential purchasers to respond coherently. Findings - Findings indicate limited capacity for potential investors to rationalize the simplistic choices presented, suggesting that franchise choice is determined to a large degree by non-rational factors. Research limitations/implications - This research is embryonic (exploratory) in nature with the findings providing an imperative for further investigation into workable attributes of franchise systems. Analysis is limited to prospective franchisees' perceptions and needs to be triangulated with franchisor and policy-makers perspectives. Practical implications - Both franchisors and policy makers can utilize this research to improve transparency in the disclosure document. Prospective franchisees should then be able to make more effective decisions about the franchise systems of choice. Social implications - A reduction in conflict within the franchising sector (no matter how trivial) will improve the business operations, franchisee and employee welfare throughout the sector. Progress on this topic will improve the sustainability and overall attractiveness of the sector. Originality/value - Conjoint analysis has not been used previously in franchising research. The use of BWS on prospective franchisee perceptions is innovative providing a basis for much research to be done in this field of research.

Methods: In a population-based study of Chinese people aged between 15 and 59 in Hong Kong, the Chinese version of the BHS and the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies – Depression scale were administered by trained interviewers and suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts were self-reported. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis and regression analysis were used to compare the performance of the BHS and its components in identifying people with suicidality and depression. Smoothed level of suicidal tendency was assessed in relation to scores on the BHS and its component to identify thresholds.

40|$|Working paperThis paper {{discusses}} the challenges associated with collecting time-use data in developing countries. The paper suggests potential solutions, {{concentrating on the}} two most common time-use methods used in development settings: stylized questions and time diaries. The paper identifies a significant lack of rigorous empirical research comparing these methods in development settings, and begins to fill this gap by analyzing data from Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index surveys in Bangladesh and Uganda. The surveys include stylized questions and time diary estimates for the same individual. The study finds limited evidence that stylized questions are more feasible (in terms of interview length) but also less accurate, compared with time diaries. These results are attributed to the relatively greater cognitive <b>burden</b> imposed <b>on</b> <b>respondents</b> by stylized questions.

Although GPS data could provide precise spatiotemporal information of vehicular or personal movements, the transportation mode (in the case of personal movements with wearable GPS devices) and trip purpose are unable to {{be obtained from the}} GPS directly. In addition, the GPS data error identification and the trip segment from the continuous GPS data are quite fundamental to transportation mode identification and trip purpose inference. In this paper, we summarized the methodologies and input variables utilized to segment trip, infer trip purpose as well as identify transportation mode in the existing researches. Compared to probability method and criteria-based method, Machine Learning are often applied in detecting transportation mode. On the other hand, rules-based methods are more popular than probabilistic method and machine learning as the tool for inferring the trip purpose.
