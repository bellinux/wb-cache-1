2500|$|The grenade was {{rectangular}} {{in shape}} and approximately [...] in length and [...] in width, and weighed about [...] Its explosive content consisted of around [...] of <b>blasting</b> <b>explosive,</b> which was usually either ammonal or TNT. On {{the top of the}} grenade was a plate, under which the user would insert a chemical igniter, which would act as the weapon's fuse. When a vehicle drove over the grenade, its weight crushed the plate, which in turn cracked the igniter; this then leaked acid onto a sensitive chemical which detonated the charge. The grenade was designed so that it could either be thrown at a vehicle like an ordinary anti-tank grenade, or placed at a location when used as an anti-tank mine. It was also fitted with areas where blasting caps or cordtex could be placed, so that it {{could be used as a}} demolition charge. When the grenade was used, it was recommended that the user be within a short distance of their target, ideally concealed within a trench; if the target were an armoured vehicle, then the best areas to target were the sides and rear, where the engine compartment was located and armour was generally thinner.|$|E

50|$|A {{major step}} forward was the {{discovery}} of guncotton, a nitrocellulose-based material, by German chemist Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1846. He promoted its use as a <b>blasting</b> <b>explosive</b> and sold manufacturing rights to the Austrian Empire.

John Taylor obtained an English patent for guncotton; and John Hall & Sons began manufacture in Faversham.|$|E

5000|$|Alfred Nobel {{developed}} {{the use of}} nitroglycerin as a <b>blasting</b> <b>explosive</b> by mixing nitroglycerin with inert absorbents, particularly [...] "kieselguhr," [...] or diatomaceous earth. He named this explosive dynamite and patented it in 1867. It was supplied ready {{for use in the}} form of sticks, individually wrapped in greased waterproof paper. Dynamite and similar explosives were widely adopted for civil engineering tasks, such as in drilling highway and railroad tunnels, for mining, for clearing farmland of stumps, in quarrying, and in demolition work. Likewise, military engineers have used dynamite for construction and demolition work.|$|E
50|$|In April 1866, three {{crates of}} {{nitroglycerin}} were shipped to California for the Central Pacific Railroad, which planned {{to experiment with}} it as a <b>blasting</b> <b>explosive</b> to expedite {{the construction of the}} 1659 ft-long Summit Tunnel through the Sierra Nevada Mountains. One of the crates exploded, destroying a Wells Fargo company office in San Francisco and killing 15 people. This led to a complete ban on the transportation of liquid nitroglycerin in California. The on-site manufacture of nitroglycerin was thus required for the remaining hard-rock drilling and blasting required for the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in North America.|$|E
50|$|Guncotton {{containing}} {{more than}} 13% nitrogen (sometimes called insoluble nitrocellulose) was prepared by prolonged exposure to hot, concentrated acids for limited {{use as a}} <b>blasting</b> <b>explosive</b> or for warheads of underwater weapons such as naval mines and torpedoes. Safe and sustained production of guncotton began at the Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills in the 1860s, and the material rapidly became the dominant explosive, becoming the standard for military warheads, although it remained too potent {{to be used as}} a propellant. More-stable and slower-burning collodion mixtures were eventually prepared using less-concentrated acids at lower temperatures for smokeless powder in firearms. The first practical smokeless powder made from nitrocellulose, for firearms and artillery ammunition, was invented by French chemist Paul Vieille in 1884.|$|E

50|$|Gunpowder {{was used}} as the only form of {{explosive}} up {{until the end of the}} 19th century. Guns using black powder ammunition would have their view obscured by a huge cloud of smoke and concealed shooters were given away by a cloud of smoke over the firing position. Guncotton, a nitrocellulose-based material, was discovered by Swiss chemist Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1846. He promoted its use as a <b>blasting</b> <b>explosive</b> and sold manufacturing rights to the Austrian Empire. Guncotton was more powerful than gunpowder, but at the same time was somewhat more unstable. John Taylor obtained an English patent for guncotton; and John Hall & Sons began manufacture in Faversham. British interest waned after an explosion destroyed the Faversham factory in 1847. Austrian Baron Wilhelm Lenk von Wolfsberg built two guncotton plants producing artillery propellant, but it was dangerous under field conditions, and guns that could fire thousands of rounds using gunpowder would reach their service life after only a few hundred shots with the more powerful guncotton.|$|E
50|$|The grenade was {{rectangular}} {{in shape}} and approximately 150 mm in length and 75 mm in width, and weighed about 1.02 kg. Its explosive content consisted of around 0.45 kg of <b>blasting</b> <b>explosive,</b> which was usually either ammonal or TNT.

When the Panama Canal simplified transport to the Pacific Fleet, DuPont consolidated production facilities in New Jersey and terminated operations at Santa Cruz in 1914.
