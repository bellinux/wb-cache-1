5|$|Meanwhile, Helen visits Edna and learns what Bob has <b>been</b> <b>up</b> to. Edna {{activates}} {{a beacon}} she {{built into the}} suits so Helen can find Bob, inadvertently causing him to be discovered and captured. Helen borrows a private plane to head for Nomanisan, but Violet and Dash have stowed away wearing their own suits, leaving Jack-Jack with a babysitter. Syndrome shoots down Helen's plane, but she and the children survive and reach the island. When Bob is informed that his family is dead, he grabs and threatens to kill Mirage, but relents when Syndrome calls his bluff.|$|E
5|$|We {{did a lot}} of {{recording}} at his house. I'd come by in the morning and Stuart would answer the door in his stocking feet– as he'd <b>been</b> <b>up</b> all night. I'd bring him {{a cup of coffee and}} say, 'Stuart, your house is a mess, there's no food in the cupboard.' Then I'd call someone from my house to bring food over for him. And then we'd work all day. We're very much the odd couple.|$|E

5|$|In {{possibly}} {{the last years}} of the 15th century, the Sanmicheli were involved in the stone decoration of the Caprioli chapel in the Church of San Giorgio, for which Cairano, almost simultaneously, prepared his Adoration, demonstrating for the first time outside of the Loggia a cooperation between the two studios. Bartolomeo Sanmicheli, {{at the beginning of the}} new century, attempted at this point to make a comeback in the local art scene with the Ark of San Tiziano of 1505, characterized by a strong decorative quality. He possibly also aspired to the commission of the ark of Sant'Apollonio, which had <b>been</b> <b>up</b> for grabs since the discovery of the relics of the holy bishop in 1503. An early involvement of Sanmicheli can be surmised in the Martinengo mausoleum, but the commission was awarded to Bernardino dei Crossi in 1503. However, based on the prevailing decorative nature of the monument, which is much more rigorously classical, it can be attributed to Cairano.|$|E
5|$|Murray next competed at the Madrid Open and {{following}} his opening win, over Nicolas Almagro, he dedicated the victory to former player Elena Baltacha. He then lost to qualifier Santiago Giraldo {{in the following}} round. Murray then reached {{the quarterfinals of the}} Rome Masters where he lost to world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in a tight match in which he had <b>been</b> <b>up</b> a break in the final set. At the French Open, Murray defeated Andrey Golubev and Marinko Matosevic before edging out 28th seed Philipp Kohlschreiber 12–10 in the final set. This was the first time Murray had ever gone beyond 7–5 in a deciding set. He followed this up with a straight sets win over Fernando Verdasco and then recorded a five set victory over Frenchman Gaël Monfils in the quarterfinal, which saw Murray rise to world No. 5 and equal his best ever French Open by reaching the semifinals. However, he subsequently lost to Nadal in straight sets, winning only 6 games in the match. After losing the 2014 French Open semifinals to Nadal, Murray appointed former women's world No. 1, and two-times slam titlist, Amélie Mauresmo as his coach in a 'historic move' which made Mauresmo the first woman to coach a top male tennis player.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, La Sombra and Rush were {{involved}} in an incident in Guadalajara, where the two attacked fans who were throwing beers at them. The following day, Jalisco's Boxing and Wrestling Commission suspended the two from wrestling in the state for three months. While the commission only suspended them from wrestling in Jalisco, CMLL decided to pull both La Sombra and Rush from their Super Viernes show three days later. CMLL did not offer an official explanation for the change. Over the summer of 2015 Los Ingobernables started to wrestle against tecnico teams instead of generally facing rudo teams as they had <b>been</b> <b>up</b> to that point. By August, 2015 Los Ingobernables found themselves facing off against Atlantis on multiple occasions, often with La Sombra going {{out of his way}} to attack Atlantis, tearing Atlantis' mask apart during matches to show his disdain for the veteran tecnico. On August 19, 2015 CMLL held a press conference where they announced that the winner of the main event of the 80th Anniversary, La Sombra, would put his mask on the line against the winner of the main event of the 81st Anniversary Show, Atlantis, in the main event of the CMLL 82nd Anniversary Show on September 18, 2015. On August 31, La Sombra lost the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship to Último Guerrero, ending his two and a half year reign. La Sombra lost the Lucha de Apuestas match to Atlantis. As a result, La Sombra was forced to unmask and reveal his real name. In early November, La Sombra and Rush began having issues with each other, which led to a singles match between the two on November 13, where Rush was victorious. After the match, which turned out to be La Sombra's final with CMLL, the two founding members of Los Ingobernables made peace with each other.|$|E

25|$|True komatiites {{are very}} rare and {{essentially}} restricted to rocks of Archean age, with few Proterozoic or Phanerozoic komatiites known (although high-magnesian lamprophyres are {{known from the}} Mesozoic).

The early Earth had much higher heat production, due to the residual heat from planetary accretion, as well as the greater abundance of radioactive elements.|$|E
