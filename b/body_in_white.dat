40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{identified}} and compared anthropometric measurements, body composition and {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD) risk factors among college students of three ethnic groups. METHODS: Subjects were assessed for cardiovascular risk. Body composition analysis was performed using the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). RESULTS: Black non-Hispanic females (30 %) were significantly (p < 0. 017) more in the "overweight" category compared to white non-Hispanic females (6. 7 %). Black non-Hispanic females had significantly (p < 0. 044) higher percentages of body fat and lower percentages of body lean, and significantly (p < 0. 040) lower percentages of body water than white non-Hispanic females. Significant positive correlations were found between CHD Risk Point Standard (CHDRPS) and percentages of <b>body</b> fat <b>in</b> <b>white</b> non-Hispanic males (p < 0. 005), Hispanic males (p < 0. 016) and Hispanic females (p < 0. 001). Significant inverse correlations were found between CHDRPS and percentages of <b>body</b> water <b>in</b> <b>white</b> non-Hispanic males (p < 0. 004), Hispanic males (p < 0. 013) and Hispanic females (p < 0. 001) : <b>body</b> lean <b>in</b> <b>white</b> non-Hispanic males (p < 0. 005), Hispanic males (p < 0. 016) and Hispanic females (p < 0. 001); and lean/fat ratio <b>in</b> <b>white</b> non-Hispanic males (p < 0. 008), Hispanic males (p < 0. 030), black non-Hispanic males (p < 0. 020) and Hispanic females (p < 0. 008).

40|$|Dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) formation/consumption was {{measured}} during several scientific excursions in the Negro River basin, Amazon, Brazil.

This was attributed to DGM generated by a photoinduced mechanism of Hg 2 + reduction. On the other hand, in black waters, with pH around 5 and high DOC values (up to 20 mg L- 1), DGM concentration stays below the detection limit during sunlit periods, which was associated to photoinduced Hgº oxidation. Photochemical experiments carried out in situ corroborate the influence of sunlight on DGM formation/consumption.

50|$|In the {{following}} years, German car makers produced more complex crash simulation studies, simulating the crash behavior of individual car body components, component assemblies, and quarter and half car <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> <b>white</b> (BIW).

These simulation codes recreated a frontal impact of a full passenger car structure (Haug 1986) and they ran to completion on a computer overnight.

40|$|Modern car-bodies {{consist of}} {{different}} types of metals in order to gain the best crash performance at minimal weight. After the press and body shop, the <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> <b>white</b> run through several paint drying processes, where also alloys of the 6 xxx series become heat-treated. Consequently, the different thermal expansion behaviour of joined aluminium-steel components leads to high bending stress conditions within the car body structure while they heat up to 200 °C. In order to describe the process deformations numerical simulations were developed, where appropriate material models are necessary. Especially aluminium alloys with a melting point of about 600 °C can exhibit viscoplastic behaviour at 200 °C under stress. In this work, creep characteristics of the aluminium alloy AA 6016 are investigated using a bending test. Based on these results an adequate model for finite element (FE-) simulations of creep strains is pointed out, which can be used for novel analyses of the whole car <b>body</b> <b>in</b> the automotive e-coat drying process...|$|R
40|$|Lawrence Buell {{has noted}} the “emergence of {{toxicity}} as a widely shared paradigm of cultural self-identification and of toxic discourse as a commensurately influential force” (665). The centrality of this paradigm to the narratives of Don DeLillo’s novel White Noise (1984) and Todd Haynes’s film [Safe] (USA, 1995) attests {{not only to}} an anxiety about the changing relationship between the body and its environment but also to a struggle over the legitimacy of discourses which express this anxiety. In these texts, the postindustrial environment is represented as producing accidental effects {{in the form of}} “toxic events:” an apparent environmental disaster <b>in</b> <b>White</b> Noise and the onset of a contested “environmental illness” in [Safe]. I wish to explore the way in which these toxic events are productive of transgressive <b>bodies.</b> Both Babette <b>in</b> <b>White</b> Noise and Carol in [Safe] suffer symptoms whose meaning confounds the masculine discourses of medicine and psychiatry. Moreover, both appropriate unauthorised forms of medical knowledge or technology and in doing so implicitly challenge the gendered authority of normative discourses. By examining the representation of accidental environments and women’s <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> <b>White</b> Noise and [Safe], I aim to explore the relationship between discourses of toxicity and discourses of female embodiment, focusing especially on discourses of consumption and pathology. I will argue that the toxic events depicted in these texts are productive not only of transgressive bodies but also of crises of gendered knowledge and power...|$|R
