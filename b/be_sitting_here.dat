500|$|In April 1959, Simpson {{left for}} France with £100 savings and two Carlton bikes, one road and one track, given in {{appreciation}} of his help promoting the company. His last words {{to his mother}} before the move were, [...] "I don't want to <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> in twenty years' time, wondering {{what would have happened}} if I hadn't gone to France". The next day, his National Service papers were delivered; although willing to serve before his move, he feared the call-up would put his potential career at risk. His mother returned them, with the hope they would understand this.|$|E
500|$|When the {{situation}} in Czechoslovakia was discussed with the Politburo, Brezhnev was not the one pushing hardest {{for the use of}} military force. Brezhnev was aware of the dire situation he was in, and if he had abstained or voted against Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia he may have been faced with growing turmoil— domestically and in the Eastern Bloc. Archival evidence suggests that Brezhnev {{was one of the few}} who was looking for a temporary compromise with the reform-friendly Czechoslovak government when their relationship was at the brink. Significant voices in the Soviet leadership demanded the re-installation of a so-called 'revolutionary government'. After the military intervention in 1968, Brezhnev met with Czechoslovak reformer Bohumil Simon, then a member of the Politburo of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and said, [...] "If I had not voted for Soviet armed assistance to Czechoslovakia you would not <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> today, but quite possibly I wouldn't either." ...|$|E
2500|$|President Obama was {{reportedly}} unhappy with U.S. intelligence agencies following {{their failure to}} foresee the 2010–2011 Tunisian uprising and the downfall of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali {{as well as the}} Egyptian protests. Responding to criticism that the State Department had failed to see the developments in Egypt coming, Clinton defended the U.S. in an interview on Al-Arabiya, saying [...] "I don't think anybody could have predicted we'd <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> talking {{about the end of the}} Mubarak presidency at the time that this all started." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{recorded}} interrogation, Erickson {{seems to have}} little knowledge of the crime. He told police, [...] "It's just so foggy... I could <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> fabricating all of it." [...] At one point he is asked questions about the weapon used to strangle Heitholt. Erickson replies that he thinks it was a shirt. When the police officer tells {{him that it was}} not, he replies [...] "Maybe a bungee cord?" [...] Eventually the police officer tells Erickson that the weapon was Heitholt's own belt. Erickson replies: [...] "I don't remember that at all." [...] After much prodding by investigators, Erickson eventually told police that he and Ferguson robbed Heitholt for drinking money. In March, 2004, Erickson and Ferguson were arrested and charged with the murder.|$|E
2500|$|One of Evans' {{distinctive}} harmonic traits is {{excluding the}} root in his chords, leaving this {{work to the}} bassist, played on another beat of the measure, or just left implied. [...] "If I am going to <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> playing roots, fifths and full voicings, the bass is relegated to a time machine." [...] This idea had already been explored by Ahmad Jamal, Erroll Garner, and Red Garland. In Evans' system, the chord is expressed as a quality identity and a color. Most of Evans' harmonies feature added note chords or quartal voicings. Thus, Evans created a self-sufficient language for the left hand, a distinctive voicing, that allowed the transition from one chord to the next while hardly having to move the hand. With this technique, he created an effect of continuity in the central register of the piano. Laying around middle C, in this region the harmonic clusters sounded the clearest, {{and at the same}} time, left room for contrapuntal independence with the bass.|$|E
