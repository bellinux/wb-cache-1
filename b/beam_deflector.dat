50|$|Low-energy {{electron}} microscopy, or LEEM, is {{an analytical}} surface science technique invented by Ernst Bauer in 1962, however, not fully developed (by Ernst Bauer and Wolfgang Telieps) until 1985. LEEM {{is a technique}} used by surface scientists to image atomically clean surfaces, atom-surface interactions, and thin (crystalline) films. In LEEM, high-energy electrons (15-20 keV) are emitted from an electron gun, focused using a set of condenser optics, and sent through a magnetic <b>beam</b> <b>deflector</b> (usually 60˚ or 90˚). The “fast” electrons travel through an objective lens and begin decelerating to low energies (1-100 eV) near the sample surface because the sample is held at a potential near that of the gun. The low-energy electrons are now termed “surface-sensitive” and the near-surface sampling depth can be varied by tuning {{the energy of the}} incident electrons (difference between the sample and gun potentials minus the work functions of the sample and system). The low-energy elastically backscattered electrons travel back through the objective lens, reaccelerate to the gun voltage (because the objective lens is grounded), and pass through the beam separator again. However, now the electrons travel away from the condenser optics and into the projector lenses. Imaging of the back focal plane of the objective lens into the object plane of the projector lens (using an intermediate lens) produces a diffraction pattern (low-energy electron diffraction, LEED) at the imaging plane and recorded {{in a number of different}} ways. The intensity distribution of the diffraction pattern will depend on the periodicity at the sample surface and is a direct result of the wave nature of the electrons. One can produce individual images of the diffraction pattern spot intensities by turning off the intermediate lens and inserting a contrast aperture in the back focal plane of the objective lens (or, in state-of-the-art instruments, in the center of the separator, as chosen by the excitation of the objective lens), thus allowing for real-time observations of dynamic processes at surfaces. Such phenomena include (but are not limited to): tomography, phase transitions, adsorption, reaction, segregation, thin film growth, etching, strain relief, sublimation, and magnetic microstructure. These investigations are only possible because of the accessibility of the sample; allowing for a wide variety of in situ studies over a wide temperature range.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a planar electro-optical light <b>beam</b> <b>deflector</b> comprising {{a row of}} adjacent prism deflectors equipped with electrodes to which an electrical voltage can be applied. A main feature of the invention is that the light beam is guided in a Z section lithium niobate or lithium tantalate crystal, preferably in a monomode layer optical waveguide extending along its surface, and the prism deflectors each consist of two triangular or prism-shaped regions in which a largely uniform polarization direction is formed by inverting the polarization direction determined by the E field vector in domaines where the spontaneous polarization direction opposes the present direction, whereby each of the neighbouring triangular-shaped regions has an opposing polarization direction, and that a square electrode covering the triangular regions {{is attached to the}} top side of the crystal and a counter-electrode is attached to the bottom side of the crystal. The measures according to the inv ention achieve the phenomenon that a refractive index with a different sign is induced in the adjacent triangular or prism-shaped regions when a voltage is applied between the electrode and the counter-electrode, whereby the distribution of refractive indices represents ideally almost a sawtooth pattern.

The process of light induced frustrating etching, where light from a laser is used to inhibit the etching of iron doped lithium niobate, {{is the subject of}} a detailed investigation so a better understanding of the process can be developed. The process was found to be dependent upon illumination and etch times, iron dopant levels, and irradiance levels. Analysis of the structures formed revealed that they were resistant to the etchant used and were positively charged. Two dimensional Fourier transform analysis of images obtained were used to confirm that the structures preferentially propagated along 3 directions each 120 o apart. A novel electro-optically controlled domain-engineered total internal reflection switch and <b>beam</b> <b>deflector</b> is also reported. Device construction uses electric field poling of lithium niobate to create two parallel but oppositely oriented domains. When an electric field is applied across the interface between these domains a change in the refractive index of equal magnitude but of opposite sign is induced. If light incident on this interface sees a sufficient difference in refractive index it can be total internally reflected. The total internal reflection switch shows high contrast ratio switching of greater than 20 dB and is less wavelength dependent than other electro-optic switches, such as the Pockels cell. The <b>beam</b> <b>deflector</b> can produce large angular deflections, which are increased by faceting of the output face.
