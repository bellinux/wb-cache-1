40|$|Introduction. <b>Black</b> <b>plum</b> (Vitex doniana) is an {{indigenous}} fruit tree species {{important for the}} livelihoods of rural populations. Currently, there is renewed national and international interest in <b>black</b> <b>plum,</b> and it {{has emerged as a}} priority species for domestication in Africa. The present work addressed farmers' indigenous knowledge of the use and management of the species among different socio-cultural groups in Benin, taking into account gender differences. The specific objective of this work was to study the knowledge, uses, local gathering practices and management systems of V. doniana {{that are part of the}} traditions of the communities in Southern Benin. Materials and methods. A total of 150 participants randomly selected from three socio-cultural groups provided survey responses. Information collected mainly referred to the motivation of respondents to conserve <b>black</b> <b>plum</b> trees on their land, the local uses and the management practices to improve the regeneration and production of the <b>black</b> <b>plum.</b> Results and discussion. The study showed that knowledge of <b>black</b> <b>plum</b> is well distributed in the community. However, people have different interests in using <b>black</b> <b>plum</b> and there is variable knowledge of use and management practices. The food and medicinal categories were the most important uses. There were no significant differences in knowledge of the management and utility of <b>black</b> <b>plum</b> between men and women, or across socio-cultural groups. Conclusion. Given its value to the communities in southern Benin, <b>black</b> <b>plum</b> should be prioritized for domestication...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Guilan {{forests are}} one of the natural {{habitats}} for the varieties of wild plum and tomato that will be consumed fresh and processed by the residents of the areas. In this study, the amount of total phenol, antioxidant capacity, total acid, the amount of total soluble solids and the ratio of total soluble solids to total acid for each genotype were analyzed under completely randomized plan with three replications. Results from this study indicate that the total soluble solids of fruits were different in the range between 03 / 0 and 93 / 15 ° Brix. So that the genotype of “sour red plum ” had the highest and genotype of “sour <b>Black</b> <b>plum</b> ” had the lowest percentage of soluble solids. Genotype of “large sloe ” with an average of 13 / 6 and the genotype of “golden plum ” with an average of 64 / 3 % of malic acid had the highest and lowest rates of the total acid. The ratio of total soluble solids to total acid of fruits was different in the range between 008 / 0 to 815 / 3. The genotype of “golden plum ” had the highest and genotype of “sour <b>black</b> <b>plum</b> ” had the lowest ratio of total soluble solids to total acid. The amount of total phenol in fruits peel and pulp mixture was in the range between 282 and 333 / 600. Genotypes of “golden plum ” and “red sloe ” had, respectively, the highest and lowest total phenol amount. Peel and pulp mixture of “sour red plum ” genotype with an average of 58 / 66 % had the highest, and “sour <b>black</b> <b>plum</b> ” with 35 / 62 % had the lowest antioxidant activity. It was also found that there is a positive linear correlation between total phenol and antioxidant activity of different genotypes of tomato tree...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} increase in the domestic organic market, especially in Buenos Aires city can be observed in Argentina. Horticultural products represent {{a large percentage of the}} total organic volume traded. Within these, increasingly evident interest in heritage type products, niche type or heirloom can be observed. As the development of these products is almost incipient, varieties of tomatoes were rescued to characterize its production profile for possible adoption by organic horticultural producers in the area of Buenos Aires. A greenhouse trial with 14 varieties of tomatoes was developed. They were: PeaceVein, Ildi Red and Yellow, <b>Black</b> <b>Plum,</b> Chadwick, Saint Pierre, Thessaloniki, TSW 10, Platense Gentile, Money maker, Mars, Uco Plata and the hybrid Koyi (from TheRuiterSeeds) and Elpida (Syngenta). Phenological and reproductive characteristics and agronomic profile of each variety were evaluated. The results concluded that some varieties are suitable to be incorporated to the horticultural trade as a complement of organic vegetables in the Horticultural Greenbelt in Buenos Aires. The most important varieties were the Ildis ones, with attractive color and piriformis; <b>Black</b> <b>Plum,</b> an old mahogany ovate tomato variety; Chadwick, also known as very productive variety of tasty fruit.

40|$|The <b>black</b> <b>plum</b> is a {{multi-purpose}} tree {{well known}} to the rural and urban populations of tropical Africa. Its uses are well documented, but its regeneration possibilities {{have not yet been}} studied, despite the importance of this species. The objective {{of this study is to}} ensure that this tree can be propagated from other organs instead of seeds. In order to achieve this, a trial propagation, using stem and root cuttings, was conducted on two types of substrate: topsoil at the planting site (sand mixed with poultry manure) and soil taken from undergrowth at the forest research station in Pobe, which focuses on the oil palm tree. The trial was based on a randomised complete block, two factors and four treatments. The results show that it is possible to propagate <b>black</b> <b>plum</b> trees from stem cuttings (46. 62 % of developed cuttings) but especially from root cuttings (96. 25 % of developed cuttings). The compared treatments significantly influenced the recovery rate of the cuttings. The first leaf produced by the stem cuttings is multi-lobed (3 - 5 lobes), while that produced by root cuttings is generally single-lobed. One year after transplanting, the substrate (2 / 3 sand and 1 / 3 chicken manure in volume) produced the best plant growth from cuttings...|$|R
