5|$|Cabbage (<b>Brassica</b> oleracea or B.oleracea var. capitata, var. tuba, var. sabauda or var. acephala) is {{a member}} of the genus <b>Brassica</b> and the mustard family, Brassicaceae. Several other cruciferous {{vegetables}} (sometimes known as cole crops) are considered cultivars of B.oleracea, including broccoli, collard greens, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi and sprouting broccoli. All of these developed from the wild cabbage B.oleracea var. oleracea, also called colewort or field cabbage. This original species evolved over thousands of years into those seen today, as selection resulted in cultivars having different characteristics, such as large heads for cabbage, large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for broccoli.|$|E
40|$|Parasitoids {{are confronted}} with many {{different}} infochemicals of their hosts and food plants during host selection. Here, we investigated the effect of kairomones from the adult host Pieris <b>brassicae</b> and of cues present on Brussels sprout plants infested by P. <b>brassicae</b> eggs on the behavioral response of the egg parasitoid Trichogramma evanescens. Additionally, we tested whether the parasitoid¿s acceptance of P. <b>brassicae</b> eggs changes with different host ages. The wasps did not discriminate between olfactory cues from mated and virgin females or between mated females and males of P. <b>brassicae.</b> T. evanescens randomly climbed on the butterflies, showing a phoretic behavior without any preference for a certain sex. The parasitoid was arrested on leaf parts next to 1 -day-old host egg masses. This arrestment {{might be due to}} cues deposited during oviposition. The wasps parasitized host eggs up to 3 days old equally well.

40|$|The cabbage moth, Mamestra <b>brassicae</b> L. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is {{a serious}} pest of {{vegetable}} crops throughout the world. In order {{to determine whether or}} not M. <b>brassicae</b> is a migrant, and if yes, what is the pattern of M. <b>brassicae</b> seasonal migration, a long-term study on M. <b>brassicae</b> from April to October in 2003 - 2014 was carried out by means of a searchlight trap on a small island located in the center of the Bohai Strait. The results show that a large number of M. <b>brassicae</b> were trapped every year on the island, which indicates that M. <b>brassicae</b> is a migrant and migrated at least 40 - 60 km across the Bohai Strait. The mean migration period of M. <b>brassicae</b> over the sea within one year is 151 ± 8 d in 2003 - 2014, with the shortest time span 78 d in 2003 and the longest 189 d in 2014, respectively. The number of M. <b>brassicae</b> captured, however, varies considerably between months or years. The majority of captures were female, with different levels of ovarian development and mating status. Most of the females trapped in May-July during 2010 - 2014 had a high mating rate and advanced level of ovarian development, suggesting that the migration of this species does not conform to the hypothesis of 'oogenesis-flight syndrome'.

40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis protein δ-endotoxins are {{toxic to}} a variety of {{different}} insect species. Larvicidal potency depends on the completion of a number of steps in the mode of action of the toxin. Here, we investigated the role of proteolytic processing in determining the potency of the B. thuringiensis Cry 1 Ac δ-endotoxin towards Pieris <b>brassicae</b> (family: Pieridae) and Mamestra <b>brassicae</b> (family: Noctuidae). In bioassays, Cry 1 Ac was over 2, 000 times more active against P. <b>brassicae</b> than against M. <b>brassicae</b> larvae. Using gut juice purified from both insects, we processed Cry 1 Ac to soluble forms that had the same N terminus and the same apparent molecular weight. However, extended proteolysis of Cry 1 Ac in vitro with proteases from both insects resulted in the formation of an insoluble aggregate. With proteases from P. <b>brassicae,</b> the Cry 1 Ac-susceptible insect, Cry 1 Ac was processed to an insoluble product with a molecular mass of ∼ 56 kDa, whereas proteases from M. <b>brassicae,</b> the non-susceptible insect, generated products with molecular masses of ∼ 58, ∼ 40, and ∼ 20 kDa. N-terminal sequencing of the insoluble products revealed that both insects cleaved Cry 1 Ac within domain I, but M. <b>brassicae</b> proteases also cleaved the toxin at Arg 423 in domain II. A similar pattern of processing was observed in vivo. When Arg 423 was replaced with Gln or Ser, the resulting mutant toxins resisted degradation by M. <b>brassicae</b> proteases. However, this mutation had little effect on toxicity to M. <b>brassicae.</b> Differential processing of membrane-bound Cry 1 Ac was also observed in qualitative binding experiments performed with brush border membrane vesicles from the two insects and in midguts isolated from toxin-treated insects...|$|R
40|$|Selected {{strains of}} non-pathogenic rhizobacteria can trigger induced {{systemic}} resistance (ISR) in plants against aboveground insect herbivores. However, {{the underlying mechanisms}} of plant-mediated interactions between rhizobacteria and herbivorous insects are still poorly understood. Using Arabidopsis thaliana Col- 0 -Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS 417 r as a model system, we investigated the performance and the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-mediated effects of rhizobacteria on the generalist caterpillar Mamestra <b>brassicae</b> and the specialist Pieris <b>brassicae.</b> Rhizobacteria colonisation of Arabidopsis roots resulted in decreased larval weight of M. <b>brassicae,</b> whereas no effect was observed on larval weight of P. <b>brassicae.</b> Using a jasmonic acid (JA) -impaired mutant (dde 2 - 2), we confirmed the importance of JA in rhizobacteria-mediated ISR against M. <b>brassicae.</b> Interestingly, in some experiments we also observed rhizobacteria-induced systemic susceptibility to M. <b>brassicae.</b> The role of soil composition in the variable outcomes of microbe-plant-insect interactions was then assessed by comparing M. <b>brassicae</b> performance and gene transcription in plants grown in potting soil or a mixture of potting soil and sand in a 1 : 1 ratio. In a mixture of potting soil and sand, rhizobacteria treatment had a consistent negative effect on M. <b>brassicae,</b> whereas the effect was more variable in potting soil. Interestingly, at 24 h post-infestation (hpi) rhizobacteria treatment primed plants grown {{in a mixture of}} potting soil and sand for stronger expression of the JA- and ethylene-regulated genes PDF 1. 2 and HEL, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND Methyl {{benzimidazole}} carbamate (MBC) fungicides {{are used}} to control the oilseed rape pathogen Pyrenopeziza <b>brassicae.</b> Resistance to MBCs {{has been reported in}} P. <b>brassicae,</b> but the molecular mechanism(s) associated with reductions in sensitivity have not been verified in this species. Elucidation of the genetic changes responsible for resistance, hypothesised to be target-site mutations in β-tubulin, will enable resistance diagnostics and thereby inform resistance management strategies. RESULTS P. <b>brassicae</b> isolates were classified as sensitive, moderately resistant or resistant to MBCs. Crossing P. <b>brassicae</b> isolates of different MBC sensitivities indicated that resistance was conferred by a single gene. The MBC-target encoding gene β-tubulin was cloned and sequenced. Reduced MBC sensitivity of field isolates correlated with β-tubulin amino acid substitutions L 240 F and E 198 A. The highest level of MBC resistance was measured for isolates carrying E 198 A. Negative cross-resistance between MBCs and the fungicides diethofencarb and zoxamide was only measured in E 198 A isolates. PCR-RFLP was used to screen isolates for the presence of L 240 F and E 198 A. The substitutions E 198 G and F 200 Y were also detected in DNA samples from P. <b>brassicae</b> populations after cloning and sequencing of PCR products. The frequencies of L 240 F and E 198 A in different P. <b>brassicae</b> populations were quantified by pyrosequencing. There were no differences in the frequencies of these alleles between P. <b>brassicae</b> populations sampled from different locations or after fungicide treatment regimes. CONCLUSIONS The molecular mechanisms affecting sensitivity to MBCs in P. <b>brassicae</b> have been identified.

A DNA-based soil testing service that identifies fields where P. <b>brassicae</b> poses a significant risk of clubroot infection is now commercially available. It was applied here in field surveys to monitor the prevalence of P. <b>brassicae</b> DNA in field soils intended for winter OSR production and winter OSR field experiments. In 2013 in Scania, prior to planting, P. <b>brassicae</b> DNA was detected in 60 % of 45 fields on 10 of 18 farms. In 2014, P. <b>brassicae</b> DNA was detected in 44 % of 59 fields in 14 of 36 farms, in the main winter OSR producing region in southern Sweden. P. <b>brassicae</b> was present indicative of a risk for > 10 % yield loss with susceptible cultivars (> 1300 DNA copies g soil− 1) in 47 % and 44 % of fields in 2013 and 2014 respectively. Furthermore, P. <b>brassicae</b> DNA was indicative of sites at risk of complete crop failure if susceptible cultivars were grown (> 50 000 copies g− 1 soil) in 14 % and 8 % of fields in 2013 and 2014, respectively. A survey of all fields at Lanna research station in western Sweden showed that P. <b>brassicae</b> was spread throughout the farm, as {{only three of the}} fields (20 %) showed infection levels below the detection limit for P. <b>brassicae</b> DNA, while the level was > 50, 000 DNA copies g− 1 soil in 20 % of the fields.
