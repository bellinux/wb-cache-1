In 1932 N. J. Eastman, acknowledged dean of American obstetricians at mid-century, stated that, if asked in what respect obstetrics had advanced most conspicuously during the preceding five decades, he would point to the changes in the indications, technique, and prognosis of cesarean section. The cesarean operation has spared maternal and infant lives in the millions and prevented countless cases of cerebral palsy and other birth injuries of the newborn and myriads of maternal genital fistulas. [1] The first cesarean section in the United States, as recorded by Harris [2] was performed on a snowbank (packed hill of snow) in Nassau, New York, in 1822 by the patient herself, a 14 -year-old. She survived the operation after her L-shaped abdominal incision was dressed by a Dr. Bassett, her employer, and Drs. John W. Francis and John B. Beck, who reported the case (6). The first professionally performed cesarean section in America was credited by Harris and subsequent historians [3] to Dr. John Lambert Richmond of Newtown, Ohio, and was performe...|$|E

40|$|<b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{brushless}} motors in detail, let’s {{clear up}} a few points about terminology. The term “brushless ” has become accepted as referring to a particular variety of servo motor. Clearly a step motor is a brushless device, as is an AC induction motor (in fact, the step motor can {{form the basis of}} a brushless servo motor, often called a hybrid servo, which is discussed later). However, the socalled “brushless ” motor has been designed to have a similar performance to the DC brush servo without the limitations imposed by a mechanical commutator. Within the brushless category are two basic motor types: trapezoidal and sine wave motors. The trapezoidal motor is really a brushless DC servo, whereas the sine wave motor bears a close resemblance to the AC synchronous motor. To fully explain the difference between these motors, we must review the evolution of the brushless motor. Fig. 1. 35 Conventional DC brush motor Brushless Motor Operation To turn this motor into a brushless design, we must start by eliminating the windings on the rotor. This can be achieved by turning the motor inside out. In other words, we make the permanent magnet the rotating part and put the windings on the stator poles. We still need some means of reversing the current automatically – a cam-operated reversing switch could be made to do this job (Fig. 1. 36). Obviously such an arrangement with a mechanical switch is not very satisfactory, but the switching capability of non-contacting devices tends to be very limited. However, in a servo application, we will use an electronic amplifier or drive which {{can also be used to}} do the commutation in response to low-level signals from an optical or hall-effect sensor (see Fig. 1. 37). This component is referred to as the commutation encoder. So unlike the DC brush motor, the brushless version cannot be driven by simply connecting it to a source of direct current. The current in the external circuit must be reversed at defined rotor positions. Hence, the motor is actually being driven by an alternating current...|$|E
40|$|Ironically, the “learning of percent” {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{problematic}} aspects of school mathematics. In our view, these difficulties are not associated with the arithmetic aspects of the “percent problems”, but mostly with two methodological issues: firstly, providing students with a simple and accurate understanding of the rationale behind the use of percent, and secondly - overcoming the psychological complexities of the fluent and comprehensive understanding by the students of the sometimes specific wordings of “percent problems”. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> percent, it is necessary to acquaint students with a much more fundamental and important (regrettably, not covered by the school syllabus) classical concepts of quantitative and qualitative comparison of values, to give students the opportunity to learn the relevant standard terminology and become accustomed to conventional turns of speech. Further, it makes sense to briefly touch on the issue (important in its own right) of different representations of numbers. Percent is just one of the technical, but common forms of data representation: p% = p × % = p × 0. 01 = p × 1 / 100 = p/ 100 = p × 10 - 2 "Percent problems” are involved in just two cases: I. The ratio of a variation m to the standard M II. The relative deviation of a variation m from the standard M The hardest and most essential in each specific "percent problem” is not the routine arithmetic actions involved, but the ability to figure out, to clearly understand which of the variables involved in the problem instructions is the standard and which is the variation. And in the first place, this is what teachers need to patiently and persistently teach their students. As a matter of fact, most primary school pupils are not yet quite ready for the lexical specificity of “percent problems”. [...] Math teachers should closely, hand in hand with their students, carry out a linguistic analysis of the wording of each problem [...] . Schoolchildren must firmly understand that a comparison of objects is only meaningful when we speak about properties which can be objectively expressed in terms of actual numerical characteristics. In our opinion, an adequate acquisition of the teaching unit on percent cannot be achieved in primary school due to objective psychological specificities related to this age and because of the level of general training of students. Yet, if we want to make this topic truly accessible and practically useful, it should be taught in high school.

Most current discussion and monetary-policy formulations involve the first definition, low inflation.

Algebraic specification techniques [GOG 78, GUT 77, LIS 75] describe a data abstraction by describing the interaction between the operations, without reference to the underlying representation. An algebraic specification of an ADT has a syntactic part and a semantic part.

The syntactic specification is similar to the interface specification part of a class definition in an object oriented language.

Second, muscle tone is measured with a electromyogram (EMG) machine. Third, eye movement is recorded via an electro-oculogram (EOG).

However, this is not a geographical exercise. We cannot count on South Africa as a place where Ubuntu is practiced or on South Korea living in communities according to Sangsaeng. The reason is that Western civilisation, with its own spirituality, has permeated all corners of the earth. My thesis is that this is the spirituality of money; biblically speaking, of Mammon. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> can <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> a spirituality for democracy and social cohesion, we need to address the spirituality of the status quo in order to understand what the alternative could be.

Only by looking at this history can we really understand how money did not only change socio-economic and political structures but also hearts, minds and the spirituality of people. Intradisciplinary and/or�interdisciplinary�implications: This article challenges the normal Western assumption that democracy is but a political issue of voting every 4 or 5 years. Instead it shows that real democracy is linked to economic and social justice, as well as to deep cultural and spiritual roots. Authors should carefully identify the contextual perspective they challenge, identifying the potential results of the proposed research and whether it calls for a change in traditional discourse as well as whether such a change is possible. Key insights into the research results and its future function should be revealed. Today we are faced with life-killing civilization, manifested in economic injustice, ecological destruction, the threat of Empire, and the escalation of religious conflicts.

We recorded it in the formal dining room...where, upon the walls hung all these very old and expensive pieces of art...looking at us...we were never alone.""It always seemed to me that whenever Rupert walked into one of these old, dark castle rooms, that the rooms were on fire. There was a connection between us that everyone around us instantly picked up on, and everyone was very careful to respect our space...our TIMESPACE, so we all lived at the castle for about four-and-a-half months. I went home with him to England to mix the album at his studio...he left in December. I joined him there in London in January. We left immediately for his studio, Farmyard Studios, somewhere outside London. It was like being in a cottage in Wales, it was a little spooky...the atmosphere was like nothing I had ever experienced. Then something happened to him that simply made it impossible for us to ever be together again. I left him there...the rooms were still burning, but the fire had been stolen from us. It wasn't over love, in fact...it had nothing to do with love. It was just a bad situation. I came back to Los Angeles, a very changed woman. And now, long nets of white...cloud my memory...Now I remember the rooms, the music, and how truly magic the whole thing was..." ...|$|R
