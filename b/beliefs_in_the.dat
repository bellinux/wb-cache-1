5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> superiority of oral language to sign language, {{compounded by the fact}} that ASL is often glossed in English due to the lack of a standard writing system.|$|E

40|$|Aim: From 2005 to 2009, {{increased}} {{support for}} restrictive alcohol policy measures was observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian population. This article addresses whether this increase was mediated by changes <b>in</b> <b>belief</b> about <b>the</b> effectiveness of restrictive measures and belief about the harm caused by drinking. Method: The data {{were derived from}} five surveys conducted during the period 2005 – 2009 (N 7244). In each survey, we used identical measures of attitudes towards regulation of price and availability, <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of such measures and <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> association between overall consumption and harm. Results: During the period, {{there was an increase}} in support for restrictive policymeasures; <b>in</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of thesemeasures and <b>in</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> harm caused by drinking. Increased support for restrictive measures was partly mediated by changes <b>in</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> terms of statistically significant indirect effects from both <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of such measures and <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> harm caused by drinking. Half of the increased support for restrictive measures could be attributed to changes <b>in</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Conclusion: Strengthening people’s <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of restrictive measures and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> harm caused by drinking may increase public support for restrictive alcohol policy measures...|$|R

5|$|<b>Beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{divine and}} in the afterlife were {{ingrained}} in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system. These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.|$|E
5|$|Religious <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Empire and Iran were in flux {{during the}} late sixth and early seventh centuries. Judaism was an active {{proselytising}} faith, {{and at least one}} Arab political leader converted to it. Christianity had active missions competing with the Persians' Zoroastrianism in seeking converts, especially among residents of the Arabian Peninsula. All these strands came together with the emergence of Islam in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad (d. 632). After his death, Islamic forces conquered much of the Eastern Empire and Persia, starting with Syria in 634–635 and reaching Egypt in 640–641, Persia between 637 and 642, North Africa in the later seventh century, and the Iberian Peninsula in 711. By 714, Islamic forces controlled much of the peninsula in a region they called Al-Andalus.|$|E

5|$|An {{interpretation}} of {{the story about the}} Ceklin zduhać is given in an essay by literary theoretician Radoman Kordić. According to him, the story {{is a product of the}} symbolic scheme of the culture of Montenegrin Serbs. The story comprises a zduhać narration and a heroic narration. The former is based on the mythological <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> zduhaći, which were strongest in Montenegro. The latter is based on the heroic ideology exalting death in battle, which was a predominant trait of the Montenegrin society. The zduhać and the famous hero symbolize, respectively, two systems of the Montenegrin culture. At its beginning, the story is placed in the framework of the first system, but it is realized with the means and on the ideological plane of the second system. The beaten zduhać, who is supposed to die, diverges from the mythological pattern, and he replaces himself with the hero. This results in an ironic twist. The fearless hero acts in fact as a butcher of bulls which do not even fight back. The apparently happy ending degrades the zduhać into a subject without identity. Kordić argues, using mostly Lacanian psychoanalysis, that there is a third, silent narration in the story—that of the death drive—which crumbles the other two narrations.|$|E
5|$|However, Han <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afterlife {{were not}} uniform across the empire and changed over time. Not only were there many {{different}} burial customs and views on how one journeyed through the afterlife, {{but even the}} names hun and po for spirit-soul and body-soul could be substituted with demon (gui 鬼) and spirit (shen 神). Demons, or gui, {{were thought to be}} partial manifestations of the deceased which lacked their essential vital energy (qi 氣) that had to be exorcised when they maliciously caused the living to become ill; however, a demon could also be considered a neutral 'ghost'. Spirits, or shen, were usually associated with the animalistic spirits embodying certain places, such as the Earl of the Yellow River (He Bo 河伯). If proper sacrifices were made to these spirits, it was believed to bring good fortune; if ritual sacrifices were neglected, the spirit could inflict bad fortune on individuals and local communities. In the Western Han, texts left behind in tombs illustrate that the living took a more sympathetic view towards the dead than in the Eastern Han, when spirits were generally more feared as dangers to the living. The Western Han 'letters informing the underground' (gaodishu 告地書) were written to 'inform the Ruler of the Underground' 告地下王 about the deceased's wants and needs for clothing, vessels, and implements. However, 'tomb-quelling texts' (zhenmuwen 鎮墓文) that appeared during the 1st century CE acted as passports for the dead so that they did not disturb or bring danger to the living. Both Western Han and Eastern Han tombs contained 'land contracts' (diquan 地券) which stated that the deceased owned the land they were buried in.|$|E
5|$|The deification of Macedonian monarchs perhaps {{began with}} the death of PhilipII, but it was his son Alexander the Great who {{unambiguously}} claimed to be a living god. Following his visit to the oracle of Didyma in 334BC that suggested his divinity, Alexander traveled to the Oracle of Zeus Ammon — the Greek equivalent of the Egyptian Amun-Ra — at the Siwa Oasis of the Libyan Desert in 332BC to confirm his divine status. Although the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires maintained ancestral cults and deified their rulers, kings were not worshiped in the Kingdom of Macedonia. While Zeus Ammon was known to the Greeks prior to Alexander's reign, particularly at the Greek colony of Cyrene, Libya, Alexander was the first Macedonian monarch to patronize Egyptian, Persian, and Babylonian priesthoods and deities, strengthening the fusion of Near Eastern and Greek religious beliefs. After his reign, the cult of Isis gradually spread throughout the Hellenistic and Roman world, while <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian god Sarapis were thoroughly Hellenized by the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt before the spread of his cult to Macedonia and the Aegean region. The German historian Johann Gustav Droysen argued that the conquests of Alexander the Great and creation of the Hellenistic world allowed for the growth and establishment of Christianity in the Roman era.|$|E

5|$|When {{a member}} of the family died there were varying degrees of prostration and display of piety amongst family members, each one {{behaving}} differently according to the custom of kinship association with the deceased. There was to be no flashy or colorful attire while in the period of mourning, and proper funerary rituals were observed such as cleansing and clothing the deceased to rid him or her of impurities. This was one of the necessary steps in the observance of the deceased as one of the worshipped ancestors, which in turn raised the prestige of the family. Funerals were often expensive. A geomancer had to be consulted on where to bury the dead, caterers were hired to furnish the funeral banquet, and there was always the purchase of the coffin, which was burned along with paper images of horses, carriages, and servants in order for them to accompany the deceased into the next life. Due to the high cost of burial, most families opted for the cheaper practice of cremation. This was frowned upon by Confucian officials due to <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ancestral cult. They sought to ban the practice with prohibitions in 963 and 972; despite this, cremation amongst the poor and middle classes persisted. By the 12th century, the government came up with the solution of installing public cemeteries where a family's deceased could be buried on state owned property.|$|E
