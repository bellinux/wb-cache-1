5|$|A public {{hall was}} built on part of the Manor Farm site in 1965 and named Winston Churchill Hall. The land upon which it was built had been Barn Close and was bought by Councillor T. R. Parker in 1932 from King's College. He {{presented}} the land to the Ruislip Village Trust {{as the site of}} a future public hall and the Trust gave it to the urban district council in 1964 stipulating that that would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> use.|$|E
5|$|Adi Da {{initially}} {{became known}} in the spiritual counterculture of the 1970s for his books and public talks, and for the activities of his religious community. His philosophy was essentially similar to many eastern religions which see spiritual enlightenment as the ultimate priority of human life. Distinguishing his from other religious traditions, Adi Da declared {{that he was a}} uniquely historic avatar (incarnation of a god or divinity in human form). As such, Adi Da stated that henceforth devotional worship of him would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> means of spiritual enlightenment for anyone else.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{commemorative}} coins were {{increasing in}} value, and Cincinnati businessman Thomas G.

He was successful with the Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar, from which he profited greatly, and with the Cleveland piece.

5|$|The Albanian government, in {{agreement}} with the Commission, had the right to appoint and dismiss governors and upper rank officials, taking into account the demographic composition of the local religious communities. Other terms included the proportional recruitment of natives into the local gendarmerie, and the prohibition of military levies from non-indigenous people of the region. In Orthodox schools, the Greek language would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> medium of instruction, except for grades one through three. However, religious education would be exclusively in Greek. Moreover, Greek was also made equal to Albanian in all public affairs, including courts and elective councils.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, the two cart sheds {{on either}} side of the lane leading into the farm were removed. That year, Councillor T. R. Parker {{purchased}} a plot of land on the site from King's College. Manor Farm continued as a working farm until the following year, when the local council began to sell off much of the land surrounding the buildings for housing developments. Councillor Parker presented his land to the Ruislip Village Trust as the site of a future public hall, and the Trust passed it to the urban district council in 1964 stipulating that that would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> use. The council obliged and the Winston Churchill Hall was built in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Modhusudhon Tarafdar (Naseeruddin Shah) is a Bengali {{doctor who}} rescues Susanna from a suicide attempt (when she learns about Arun's marriage) {{and puts her}} on a {{mushroom}}-only diet. Although {{she does not want}} to marry him, Tarafdar persuades her with a promise that she will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> heir of his property. Actually bankrupt, he tries to poison Susanna with mushroom soup several years later for her inheritance. Her butler drinks it by accident and dies instead; in a state of shock, she shoots Tarafdar during a game of Russian roulette. That night, Susanna sets her house ablaze in another suicide attempt. Seeing the house on fire, her maid (who has six toes) tries to rescue her but dies in the attempt.|$|E

5|$|On January 24, Blandy {{named the}} Bikini Lagoon {{as the site}} for the two 1946 detonations, Able and Baker. The deep {{underwater}} test, Charlie, scheduled for early 1947, would take place in the ocean west of Bikini. Of the possible places given serious consideration, including Ecuador's Galápagos Islands, Bikini offered the most remote location with a large protected anchorage, suitable but not ideal weather, and a small, easily moved population. It had come under exclusive United States control on January 15, when Truman declared the United States to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> trustee of all the Pacific islands captured from Japan during the war. The Navy had been studying test sites since October 1945 and was ready to announce its choice of Bikini soon after Truman's declaration. On February 6, the survey ship Sumner began blasting channels through the Bikini reef into the lagoon. The local residents were not told why.|$|E
5|$|The British people {{returned}} Clement Attlee and his Labour Party {{later in}} July. Attlee and his Secretary of State for India, Lord Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, immediately ordered {{a review of}} the Indian situation. Jinnah had no comment on the change of government, but called a meeting of his Working Committee and issued a statement calling for new elections in India. The League held influence at the provincial level in the Muslim-majority states mostly by alliance, and Jinnah believed that, given the opportunity, the League would improve its electoral standing and lend added support to his claim to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> spokesman for the Muslims. Wavell returned to India in September after consultation with his new masters in London; elections, both for the centre and for the provinces, were announced soon after. The British indicated that formation of a constitution-making body would follow the votes.|$|E
5|$|The first {{title to}} be {{conceived}} was Advent Children, original envisioned as a short film presentation created by Visual Works, the animation studio behind CGI cutscenes for the company's games. Early in pre-production, {{plans to make}} Advent Children a video game rather than a film were considered, but due to several factors including Visual Works' lack of experience with actual game production, it remained a film. One of the main conditions for the project's launch was to reunite the original staff members of Final Fantasy VII: Nojima, art director Yusuke Naora, composer Nobuo Uematsu. After Advent Children began development, it was decided by the team that one title {{was not enough to}} fully explore the VII universe. In response, Before Crisis, Dirge of Cerberus and Crisis Core were conceived so as to embrace more aspects of the world and characters. Nomura himself was surprised at the creation of the games, having originally assumed that the film would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> product of the project.|$|E

5|$|Two of Alkan's {{substantial}} {{works from}} this period are musical paraphrases of literary works. Salut, cendre du pauvre, Op.45 (1856), follows {{a section of the}} poem La Mélancolie by Gabriel-Marie Legouvé; while Super flumina Babylonis, Op.52 (1859), is a blow-by-blow recreation in music of the emotions and prophecies of Psalm 137 ("By the waters of Babylon..."). This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which is believed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> remnant of Alkan's Bible translation. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of Chants inspired by Mendelssohn, which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces.|$|E
5|$|The Town of Christchurch {{by-election}} in 1860 {{was triggered}} by the resignation of Richard Packer as the Member of the House of Representatives for the Town of Christchurch electorate, and occurred during the term of the 2nd New Zealand Parliament. The previous representative of the electorate, the politician Henry Sewell, had returned after three years in England and the general expectation was that Sewell would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> contender for election. The Lyttelton Times wrote several provocative editorials, generally endorsing Sewell for his obvious ability, but criticising him for not publicly talking about his policies and plans. Sewell eventually arranged a public meeting the evening prior to nomination day; {{this was the only}} public meeting during the election campaign. After a lengthy address, which was favourably received by the Lyttelton Times, a second contender for the office put his name forward at that meeting: the publican Michael Hart. Sewell, a former premier and one of New Zealand's most senior politicians at the time, was successful against the political novice Hart.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 Robert Holmes à Court, {{the wealthy}} Australian {{investor}} who owned ATV Music Publishing, {{announced he was}} putting the ATV catalog up for sale. In 1981, McCartney was offered the ATV music catalog for £20 million ($40 million). According to McCartney, he contacted Yoko Ono about making a joint purchase by splitting the cost at £10 million each, but Ono thought they could buy it for £5 million each. When {{they were unable to}} make a joint purchase, McCartney, {{who did not want to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> owner of the Beatles' songs, did not pursue an offer on his own. According to a negotiator for Holmes à Court in the 1984 sale, McCartney was given first right of refusal and declined to purchase. Jackson was informed of the sale by his attorney, John Branca, in September 1984. An attorney for McCartney also assured Branca that McCartney was not interested in bidding. McCartney reportedly felt it was too expensive, but several other companies and investors were interested in bidding. Jackson submitted a bid of $46 million on November 20, 1984. His agents thought they had a deal several times, but encountered new bidders or new areas of debate. In May 1985, Jackson's team left talks after having spent more than $1 million and four months of due diligence work on the negotiations. In June 1985, Jackson and Branca learned that Charles Koppelman's and Marty Bandier's The Entertainment Company had made a tentative agreement with Holmes à Court to buy ATV Music for $50 million; however, in early August, Holmes à Court's team contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson raised his bid to $47.5 million, which was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly, having already completed due diligence of ATV Music. Jackson also agreed to visit Holmes à Court in Australia, where he would appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. Jackson's purchase of ATV Music was finalized on August 10, 1985.|$|E
