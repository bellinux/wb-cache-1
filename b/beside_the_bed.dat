However, Micah taunts and mocks the demon, worsening the situation. During the thirteenth night, the demon angrily screeches {{and there is}} a loud thud, causing the entire house to vibrate. Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a Ouija board. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, stands <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day.|$|E
500|$|A curtain sack, {{commonly}} found on beds of the period, {{hangs in the}} central axis between Gabriel and the attendant angel. [...] A sideboard <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> contains two types of candles and a flask of water standing in bright light falling from {{the window to the}} left. The floor is multi-colored tile-work, similar to van der Weyden's Columba altarpiece; Memling truncates the ceiling rafters in the mid-ground, {{at the end of the}} bed, with the floor extending into the foreground. Blum describes the effect as acting [...] "like an open stage for the holy figures".|$|E
500|$|When Cisneros {{describes}} the aspirations and struggles of Chicanas, {{the theme of}} place often emerges. Place refers not only to her novels' geographic locations, {{but also to the}} positions her characters hold within their social context. Chicanas frequently occupy Anglo-dominated and male-dominated places where they are subject to a variety of oppressive and prejudicial behaviors; one of these places that is of particular interest to Cisneros is the home. As literary critics Deborah L. Madsen and Ramón Saldívar have described, the home can be an oppressive place for Chicanas where they are subjugated to the will of male heads-of-household, {{or in the case of}} their own home, it can be an empowering place where they can act autonomously and express themselves creatively. In The House on Mango Street the young protagonist, Esperanza, longs to have her own house: [...] "Not a flat. Not an apartment in back. Not a man's house. Not a daddy's. A house all my own. With my porch and my pillow, my pretty purple petunias. My books and my stories. My two shoes waiting <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Nobody to shake a stick at. Nobody's garbage to pick up after." [...] An aspiring writer, Esperanza yearns for [...] "a space for myself to go, clean as paper before the poem." [...] She feels discontented and trapped in her family home, and witnesses other women in the same position. According to Saldívar, Cisneros communicates through this character that a woman needs her own place in order to realize her full potential—a home which is not a site of patriarchal violence, but instead [...] "a site of poetic self-creation." [...] One source of conflict and grief for Cisneros's Chicana characters is that the male-dominated society in which they live denies them this place. Critics such as Jacqueline Doyle and Felicia J. Cruz have compared this theme in Cisneros's work to one of the key concepts in Virginia Woolf's famous essay [...] "A Room of One's Own", that [...] "a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction," [...] or put another way, [...] "economic security" [...] and personal liberty are necessary for [...] "artistic production." ...|$|E

40|$|The thesis mainly {{deals with}} a double bed design based on ergonomic, anthropometric and {{security}} requirements for lying furniture. <b>Besides</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> structure design, appropriately chosen mattress and supporting grate should provide a good rest and allow both physical and mental regeneration. The work provides two versions of <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> {{one of which was}} selected and further processed.

60|$|There {{certainly}} was, as he phrased it, {{very little}} {{fear that he}} should sleep alone; for there was but one <b>bed</b> for <b>the</b> trio. We, on our part, had firmly protested against one man's accommodation for two; {{and we had a}} double-bedded pen in the loft of <b>the</b> house, furnished, <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds,</b> with exactly three hat-pegs and one table.

With the weapon in his hand he returned {{to the side of the}} dead man, kneeled <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding,</b> and inserted his right hand with the weapon beneath the rugs, piled a number of thicknesses of the closely woven fabric over and about the revolver with his left hand.

60|$|It was {{not very}} long before the golden water, dancing on the wall, in the old place, at the old serene time, had her calm eye fixed upon it as it ebbed away.
