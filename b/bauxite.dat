5|$|The United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{estimates}} {{that more than}} 1 million tons of gallium is contained in known reserves of <b>bauxite</b> and zinc ores. Some coal flue dusts contain small quantities of gallium, typically less than 1% by weight. However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials (see below). Thus, the availability of gallium is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} <b>bauxite,</b> zinc ores (and coal) are extracted.|$|E

5|$|During the {{processing}} of <b>bauxite</b> to alumina in the Bayer process, gallium accumulates in the sodium hydroxide liquor. From this it can be extracted {{by a variety of}} methods. The most recent is the use of ion-exchange resin. Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed <b>bauxite.</b> At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 % of the contained gallium is extractable. The remainder reports to the red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams. Gallium is removed from the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, it is further purified with zone melting or single-crystal extraction from a melt (Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially available.|$|E
40|$|Mapping of {{lateritic}} <b>bauxites</b> {{over the}} West African rifted margin {{and analysis of}} the geomorphic properties of these <b>bauxites,</b> combined with available geological data lead to a discussion of the presence of either two Meso-Cenozoic planation surfaces or a single Eocene surface to account for the morphotectonic and paleoclimatic evolution of the Guinean landforms. At large scale, two stepped bauxitic levels are documented. Ongoing or episodic uplift following Gondwana breakup and Meso-Cenozoic climate change are proposed to have allowed the formation and abandonment of an Early mid-Cretaceous surface today preserved as the higher bauxitic level, and the setting of an Eocene planation surface bearing a second generation of <b>bauxites,</b> making the lower bauxitic level. The single Eocene surface hypothesis requires that Paleogene bauxitization preserved large pre-existing relief to explain two stepped bauxitic levels of the same age. The two-surface hypothesis is favored because it would explain rebauxitization of alluvial pebbles of <b>bauxites</b> under the lower lateritic level...|$|R

5|$|Adolf Hitler was {{concerned}} about a Balkan invasion, as the area had {{been the source of}} raw materials for the German war industry, including copper, <b>bauxite,</b> chrome and oil. The Allies knew of Hitler's fears, and they launched Operation Barclay, a deception operation to play upon his concerns and to mislead the Germans into thinking the Balkans were the objective, thereby keeping Sicily less defended than it could have been. In doing so, the deception operation reinforced German strategic thinking about the likely British target. To suggest the eastern Mediterranean was the target, the Allies set up a headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, for a fictional formation, the Twelfth Army, consisting of twelve divisions. Military manoeuvres were conducted in Syria, with numbers inflated by dummy tanks and armoured vehicles to deceive observers. Greek interpreters were recruited and the Allies stockpiled Greek maps and currency. Falsified communications about troop movements were generated from the Twelfth Army headquarters, while the Allied command post in Tunis – which was to be the headquarters of the Sicily invasion – reduced radio traffic by using land-lines wherever possible.|$|E
5|$|During the series' fifty-year history {{only a few}} of {{the films}} have {{remained}} substantially true to their source material; Dr. No has many similarities to the novel and follows its basic plot, but there are a few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a giant squid, and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a centipede; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a <b>bauxite</b> mine instead of a guano quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt NASA space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating reactor coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book. Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{distribution}} of Fe 3 +-kaolinite, Al-goethite and Al-hematite and their contents of Fe and AI in <b>bauxites</b> and ferricretes {{are controlled by}} water activity, dissolved silica activity, temperature and particle size. The proposed model, based on ideal solid-solution equilibria in the Fe 203 -AlzO 3 -SiOz-H 20 system, takes into account water and silica activities. By using the same considerations as those previously developed for the Fe 203 -AIzO 3 -H 20 system, the model calculates the amounts of coexisting phases, A 1 or Fe substitution ratios in goethite, hematite or kaolinite, and the stability field distributions of the minerals under various conditions. Thermodynamic equilibrium conditions and element distributions within the mineral constituents are shown to be dependent onthe parameters cited above. The model yields results compatible with natural observations on lateritic profiles. Laterites include <b>bauxites,</b> ferricretes, mottle clays, lithomarges and saprolites, and are formed in humid tropical weathering conditions. In most lateritic profiles, kaolinite, goethites, hematites and quartz are the dominant minerals (McFarlane, 1976, 1983; Nahon, 1976; Leprun, 1979; Muller et al., 1981) while gibbsite and boehmite are also present in <b>bauxites,</b> latosols, oxisols and several kinds of ferrallitic soils (Loughnan & Bayliss, 1961...|$|R

40|$|Mineralogical, chemical, and Li and Nd isotopic {{compositions}} of two drill cores (8 - 9 m deep) through <b>bauxites</b> {{developed on}} the Miocene Columbia River Basalts document the changes associated with basalt weathering, provide {{insights into the}} processes involved, and allow us to examine the overall influence of chemical weathering on juvenile (basaltic) crust. Gibbsite, hematite, ±kaolinite, halloysite, goethite, and maghemite are the weathering products in the <b>bauxites.</b> Quartz is observed near {{the tops of the}} cores and its abundance decreases progressively with depth; no quartz is observed below five meters depth in either core. Most major and trace elements, including "mobile" and some "immobile" elements are severely depleted in the <b>bauxites.</b> Niobium is less mobile relative to the rare earth elements, thus chemical weathering attenuates the negative Nb anomaly in the continental crust. Li and Nd are strongly depleted relative to fresh basalt, and both increase systematically towards the surface in the quartz-bearing samples while δ 7 Li and ε Nd values decrease systematically towards the surface in these same samples. Both Li and Nd were likely lost from the <b>bauxites</b> through leaching. The systematic enrichment of Li, Nd, and quartz, as well as the less radiogenic Nd isotopic composition at the tops of both profiles reflects 20 - 60 wt. % addition of an eolian component to the soils. The eolian dust is unlikely to have experienced significant post-depositional weathering due to the relatively high Li contents near the tops of the profiles, and, therefore, the low δ 7 Li and ε Nd values suggest that the dust came from an old, weathered region of the continent. Our results demonstrate that lithium isotopes are sensitive tracers of chemical weathering, particularly in extreme weathering settings, and support the hypothesis that chemical weathering influences the mass and composition of the continental crust. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
