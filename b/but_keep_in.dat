2500|$|The Kuvasz is an {{intelligent}} dog {{and is often}} described as having a clownish sense of humor which can last throughout their adolescence and into adulthood. They are intensely loyal and patient pets who appreciate attention but may also be somewhat aloof or independent, as well as thoroughly cunning, particularly with strangers. They rank a low 42nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, <b>but</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind that Coren's criteria focus on how fast a dog can learn obedience [...] "tricks"—a limited test of intelligence.|$|E
2500|$|To resolve ambiguity, [...] "P1M" [...] is a one-month {{duration}} and [...] "PT1M" [...] is a one-minute duration (note the time designator, T, that precedes the time value). The smallest value used {{may also have}} a decimal fraction, as in [...] "P0.5Y" [...] to indicate half a year. This decimal fraction may be specified with either a comma or a full stop, as in [...] "P0,5Y" [...] or [...] "P0.5Y". [...] The standard does not prohibit date and time values in a duration representation from exceeding their [...] "carry over points" [...] except as noted below. [...] Thus, [...] "PT36H" [...] {{could be used as}} well as [...] "P1DT12H" [...] for representing the same duration. <b>But</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind that [...] "PT36H" [...] {{is not the same as}} [...] "P1DT12H" [...] when switching from or to Daylight saving time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} given {{generally}} favorable reviews, receiving around an 82.68% on GameRankings. [...] GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{commented on the}} game's sound, graphics and originality and gave it an 8.4, stating, [...] "While the game isn't a strict sequel, it does {{take place in the}} same universe, with the same graphics style and nearly identical gameplay. ... he additional levels, the two-player option, and the inclusion of the Parappa remixes in Um Jammer Lammy add a value that Parappa the Rapper simply can't touch. <b>But</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind that the game doesn't stray far from the formula, and the game's difficulty will put off those who never mastered Parappa. So, to put it another way, if you didn't play Parappa to death and love every minute of it, you might as well skip out on Um Jammer Lammy." [...] Similarly, IGN gave it an 8.6 and commented on the gameplay, story, graphics and sound, stating, [...] "If you can look past all the crazy effects and wild animations, the plot isn't as funny, or as cute, as Parappa the Rapper's. In fact, it was kind of bland. ... But the rest of the game is sweet. ... Um Jammer Lammy is a great addition to the Parappa cosmos... has so much more that Parappa didn't have." [...] Game Revolution also gave it a B, calling it [...] "a cool game, {{if for no other reason}} than to entertain sufficiently inebriated party guests. It's easily the most insane mish-mash of psychadelia [...] yet seen on a console, and at least deserves a shot (or the whole bottle, even)", but criticized the story, calling it [...] "the most obtuse, disjointed, drug-induced mess of a story that has ever been conceived, period." [...] (The site even went so far as to rate the game as #40 on the list of the Top 50 Worst Game Names Ever.) ...|$|E
