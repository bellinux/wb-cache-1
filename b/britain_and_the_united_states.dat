5|$|The {{involvement}} of the Belgian Congo (the modern-day Democratic Republic of Congo) in World War II began with the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940. Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the Allied side, administered by the Belgian government in exile, and provided much-needed raw materials, most notably gold and uranium, to <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under the 1800 Treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain {{returned}} the Louisiana Territory to France. In {{connection with this}} transfer, France agreed not to sell the territory to a third party; French foreign minister Talleyrand had indicated that a strong French Louisiana would halt the expansion of <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in the New World.|$|E

5|$|At {{a meeting}} in Paris in 1914, Piłsudski presciently {{declared}} that in the impending war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter powers must in their turn be beaten by France, <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> By contrast, Roman Dmowski, Piłsudski's rival, believed {{that the best way}} to achieve a unified and independent Poland was to support the Triple Entente against the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, Cumberbatch {{appeared}} with Sesame Street characters Murray and Count von Count for PBS.

5|$|In the 19th century, {{approaches}} to Handel in German and English-speaking countries diverged further. In Leipzig in 1856, the musicologist Friedrich Chrysander and the literary historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus founded the Deutsche Händel-Gesellschaft {{with the aim}} of publishing authentic editions of all Handel's works. At the same time, performances in <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> moved away from Handel's performance practice with increasingly grandiose renditions. Messiah was presented in New York in 1853 with a chorus of 300 and in Boston in 1865 with more than 600.|$|E

5|$|Iron ships {{had first}} been {{proposed}} for military {{use in the}} 1820s. In the 1830s and 1840s, France, <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> had all experimented with iron-hulled but unarmored gunboats and frigates. However, the iron-hulled frigate was abandoned {{by the end of}} the 1840s, because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot; iron was more brittle than wood, and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood.|$|E

5|$|Tensions between <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> {{escalated}} {{again during}} the Napoleonic Wars, as Britain tried to cut off American trade with France and boarded American ships to impress men into the Royal Navy. The US declared war, the War of 1812, and invaded Canadian territory. In response Britain invaded the US, but the pre-war boundaries were reaffirmed by the 1814 Treaty of Ghent, ensuring Canada's future would be separate {{from that of the}} United States.|$|E

5|$|The Caribbean rose in {{importance}} again later in 1812, with {{the outbreak of}} the War of 1812 between <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> American privateers threatened British trade routes and Royal Navy ships were sent out to defeat them, including Southampton, which was wrecked in the Bahamas during an anti-privateer patrol in November 1812. There were no further significant actions in the region during the Napoleonic Wars, the presence of Royal Navy patrols deterred any large scale French or American operations in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|These revivals {{could be}} made using {{pantograph}} machine engraving systems, which gave a cleaner result than historic typefaces whose master punches had been hand-carved, and allowed rapid development of a family in a large range of sizes. In addition, the new hot metal typesetting technology of the period created increasing availability and demand for new fonts. Among hot metal typesetting companies, Monotype's branches in <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> brought out separate versions, and the American branch of Linotype licensed that of ATF.|$|E
5|$|Until 1992, Górecki {{was known}} only to connoisseurs, {{primarily}} as one of several composers from the Polish School responsible for the postwar Polish music renaissance. That year, Elektra-Nonesuch released a recording of the 14-year-old symphony that topped the classical charts in <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> To date, it {{has sold more than}} a million copies, vastly exceeding the expected lifetime sales of a typical symphonic recording by a 20th-century composer. This success, however, has not generated similar interest in Górecki's other works.|$|E
