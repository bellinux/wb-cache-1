50|$|The {{clutch of}} the American yellow warbler is 3-6 (typically 4-5, rarely 1-2) eggs. Incubation to {{hatching}} usually takes 11 days, but may {{take up to}} two weeks. The nestlings weigh 1.3 g on average, and are brooded for an average 8-9 days after hatching, and leave the nest the following day or the one thereafter. Mangrove warblers, on the other hand, have only 3 eggs per clutch on average and incubate some 2 days longer. Its average post-hatching <b>brooding</b> <b>time</b> is 11 days. Almost half of the parents (somewhat more in the mangrove warbler, somewhat less in the American yellow warbler) attend the fledglings for some time after these leave the nest. This post-fledging care can extend for two additional weeks or more, and sometimes the pairs separate early, each accompanied by one to three of the young.|$|E
40|$|Climate is an {{important}} factor limiting demography and distribution patterns in many organisms. For species with a broad geographical distribution, the mechanism by which climate influences demography is likely to vary dramatically {{from one end of the}} range to the other. In this paper we first assess, in a Scottish population of hen harriers Circus cyaneus, how temperature and rainfall influence adult behaviour and chick mortality patterns at the nest. We then test for associations between harrier productivity and weather across Scotland, towards the northern edge of the range, and Spain, towards the southern edge of the range. We show that during the nestling period, female <b>brooding</b> <b>time</b> increased in cold weather. Male provisioning rate was negatively related to temperature and rainfall. Chick mortality increased in cold temperatures and was most likely to occur at nests where male prey delivery rates were low relative to temperature. Annual values of harrier fledged brood size across Scotland were positively related to summer temperature suggesting that the patterns seen in one population held at a national scale. In Spain, however, the opposite patterns were observed with fledged brood size being negatively related to temperature. This shows that whilst the impact of weather on productivity may be equally strong at two ends of a geographical range, the mechanisms vary dramatically. Large-scale predictive models need to take such patterns into account...|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} of Corophium multisetosum Stock, 1952 in Areao displayed a semiannual, iteroparous life history. Mean longevity {{was similar to}} 6 mo, with the estimated life span longer for overwintering individuals born in autumn than for individuals born in spring. Length-frequency data indicated that the length increment per moult is probably higher in males than females; however females moulted more frequently and achieved a larger body size. Preliminary growth rates were 100 mum d(- 1) for juveniles and 19 to 29 mum d(- 1) for mature females, with the lower values occurring during the winter. It was estimated that under favourable conditions females may attain reproductive size and mature within 1 mo. Although incubating females were present all year round, recruitment occurred in spring, almost ceased during the summer, peaked in autumn, and decreased again during the winter. Extreme temperatures and very low salinities during winter and summer may have deterred breeding, while moderate temperatures (15 to 20 degreesC) and salinities > 1 psu in spring and autumn were apparently favourable for reproduction. The unfavourable summer conditions constrained breeding and synchronised the timing of reproduction. In late-autumn and during the winter, as temperature decreased and <b>brooding</b> <b>time</b> increased, synchrony was progressively lost. Brood size varied {{as a function of}} embryonic developmental stage, size of incubating females, and season. The life-history pattern and reproductive features of C. multisetosum in Areao are closely related to temperature and salinity; other environmental conditions such as oxygen content of the water and food availability may also be relevant...|$|E
40|$|Applying {{pesticides}} to crops {{is one of}} {{the causes}} of water pollution by surface runoff, and chlorpyrifos, trifluralin and chlorothalonil are used respectively as insecticide, herbicide and fungicide for crop plants widely. To explore effects of three pesticides on aquatic organisms, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities were determined after 24 h and 48 h exposure of D. magna with ages of 6 – 24 h to several low concentrations of chlorpyrifos (0. 36, 0. 72, 1. 43, 2. 86, 5. 72 μg∙L− 1), trifluralin (0. 17, 0. 33, 0. 66, 1. 33, 2. 65 mg∙L− 1) and chlorothalonil (0. 09, 0. 18, 0. 36, 0. 72, 1. 43 mg∙L− 1) respectively. Main reproductive parameters including first pregnancy <b>time,</b> first <b>brood</b> <b>time,</b> the number of first brood and total fecundity after 21 d exposures at the same concentrations of pesticides as described above were also measured. The results showed that the activities of GST increased in lower concentrations and decreased in higher concentrations after 24 h exposure to three pesticides, respectively. The activities of SOD showed the same changes after 48 h exposure. With the time prolonged, the activities of GST decreased while the activities of SOD increased. After 21 d exposure, the first pregnancy <b>time</b> and first <b>brood</b> <b>time</b> were delayed, while the number of the first brood and total fecundity per female decreased with increasing concentrations. These results corroborated that GST activity was more sensitive to those pesticides than SOD activity, and there was a significant relationship between total fecundity and pesticides-dose(r> 0. 94, n= 6), GST activity after 48 h exposure and total fecundity after 21 d exposure (r> 0. 92, n= 6) ...|$|R
5000|$|Like {{other species}} of {{pipefish}}, the broadnosed pipefish is sex-role reversed: males brood the eggs and because of their increased investment in offspring are the choosier sex, whereas females compete more intensely than males for access to mates.

40|$|International audienceStudy of {{physiological}} mechanisms {{can help us}} to understand how animals respond to changing environmental conditions. In particular, stress hormones (i. e. glucocorticoids, such as corticosterone) are described as mediating resource allocation, allowing animals to adjust their physiology and behaviour to predictable and unpredictable changes in the environment. In this study, we investigated the effects of an experimental increase in baseline corticosterone levels on the breeding effort and the reproductive output of chick-rearing male Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). The number of chicks per nest, their body mass, and their size were monitored throughout the study. Direct observations allowed measurement of the time spent foraging at sea and caring for the young on the nest. At {{the end of the}} treatment, blood samples were collected for isotope analysis. Although all birds raised at least one chick, reproductive output was decreased by 42 % in corticosterone-treated birds compared with control birds. The increase in corticosterone levels during the guard stage did not affect the mass of surviving chicks or the brood mass at fledging. Corticosterone-treated males spent on average 21 % more time at the nest than control birds. However, the duration of foraging trips was similar between both groups. In addition, the similarity of isotopic signatures suggests that both groups foraged at similar locations and ingested the same prey species. The detailed on-land behaviour of birds should be examined in further studies to clarify the possible links between corticosterone levels, <b>brooding</b> <b>time,</b> and reproductive output. Understanding the relationships between glucocorticoids, fitness, and ultimately population dynamics is fundamental to enabling conservation physiology as a discipline to be successful in helping to manage species of conservation concern...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. Extremely {{little is}} known about Octopus oliveri, its life history, distribution, or behavior. It was {{originally}} found in the Kermadec Islands, and since then has been described in Japan and Hawai´i. This study establishes the identity of Octopus oliveri through the use of genetic testing (COI marker) and morphological characteristics. In addition, mating behavior, <b>brooding</b> <b>time,</b> egg development, and paralarvae of Octopus oliveri, are described for the first time. Females lay approximately 5000 eggs and brood them for 33 to 47 days. Females and males mate with multiple partners when housed communally in tanks. As is true with most octopuses, female O. oliveri have two oviducts for sperm storage and may be able to store viable sperm for at least 100 days and up to 10 months. This suggests that sperm selection or competition may be occurring, however it has rarely been studied in octopods and never in O. oliveri. Through a combination of behavioral and genetic studies, this research found multiple paternity to be the rule in Octopus oliveri, both in the field and in captivity. Four sets of behavioral experiments were recorded wherein six females were mated with three males in varying order, for a total of 24 females and 12 males. Mating pairs mated in the reach, mount and beak-to-beak positions. In the behavioral trials, the largest females mated for the longest amount of time. Five microsatellite markers were developed and used to test paternity in eleven egg broods resulting from the behavioral trials. The results showed skewed paternity in most broods, suggesting that sperm competition is present in this species. The two predictive variables in determining male mating success were mate order and male size. The first male to mate with a female in behavioral experiments was more likely to sire more offspring, as were the largest males. This is the first study in an octopus that combines both behavioral and genetic information to determine fertilization success. This study contributes to the growing research on cephalopod mating systems and in particular shows that octopus mating dynamics may be more complex than previously thought...|$|E
40|$|Information on the {{breeding}} behaviour {{and development of}} wild New Zealand falcons (Falco novaeseelandiae) is scarce. It has recently been shown that the species frequently uses plantation forests for breeding purposes and {{a better understanding of}} falcons breeding behaviour has implications for forestry harvesting practices as well as strategies to conserve the species. In this study {{the breeding}} behaviour and development of New Zealand falcons were recorded at two nests in Kaingaroa Forest, an extensive plantation forest, using direct hide observations. Both nests were observed during the later part of incubation, the entire nestling and early post-fledging periods. Nest observations were recorded during a four-month period between 5 November 2006 and 2 March 2007. Incubation was shared between parents and it was observed that the male provided about 30 % of the total time on the eggs. The male‟s investment during the incubation period was primarily incubation of the eggs to allow the female time to hunt. Incubation remained constant after the laying of the last egg in the clutch despite a stoat (Mustela erminea) attempting to predate the eggs. During incubation, the male provided only occasional prey for the female. Brooding was also shared by both parents. The male, however, contributed only 10 % of the total <b>brooding</b> <b>time,</b> mostly during the first seven days of the nestling period. Brooding activity was high for up to the first six days, before gradually declining until the chicks reached 14 days old at which point it ceased. This decline in brooding coincided with the chicks‟ development of thermo-regulation. The mean prey delivery rate was 0. 82 prey items per hour and the mean feeding rate was slightly higher at 0. 90 feeds per hour. Assisted feeding of the chicks was almost always undertaken by the female. The male‟s primary role during the nestling period was prey delivery. During the early nestling period the female spent the majority of the time brooding chicks. As the nestling period progressed, however, this role shifted primarily to hunting for the young. By establishing a set of guidelines for forest managers and captive breeders, this study makes a strong direct contribution to the management and conservation of the New Zealand falcon. This study establishes development milestones for breeding events, including the duration of the breeding cycle that will assist forestry managers to minimise their impact upon nesting birds...|$|E

25|$|The precise {{reasons for}} P. dominula {{to have such}} shorter brood {{development}} timing is unknown, {{but a number of}} conjectures are offered. At the mechanical level, both genetic factors (e.g., smaller adult body size) and environmental influences (e.g., higher provisioning levels) may play a role. In a different aspect, the selection pressure exerted by the European social parasites such as Polistes sulcifer and Polistes semenowi might have caused the developmental times in P. dominula to be shorter.
