40|$|Recently, South Sulawesi Provincial {{government}} has launched the “ gong ” {{program with the}} main objective to optimize all the resources (land, infrastructures, and farmers) in agriculture <b>areas</b> <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> production in the province. This study is aimed at identifying the suitability and availability of land <b>areas</b> <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> development in Maros Regionthe regency having the most extensive agriculture production in South Sulawesi province. This study employed land evaluation method in geographic information system (GIS) based on the FAO Framework for Land Evaluation. Land availability was assessed from overlaying information on land use (obtained from available land use map and SPOT XS image interpretation) and suitability classes based on the FAO Framework, as well as administration boundary map. The {{results indicated that the}} S 1 (highly suitable) class comprises a total area of approximately 34, 468 ha, or about 24 % from the total area. The limiting factors for S 2 (moderately suitable) and S 3 (marginally suitable) classes are slope and nutrient availability, but with the advanced management efforts (moderately input) such sub-classes can actually promote S 3 class to S 2 level. It was also found that from a total of 144, 085 ha of the study area, potential <b>maize</b> development <b>area</b> (<b>for</b> extensification) covers approximately 24, 716 ha (or 35. 6 %). Tanralili, Bantimurung, and Simbang sub-districts cover the largest suitable area, where no significant limiting factors exist. Surprisingly, potential development <b>area</b> <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> in Camba, Mallawa, and Tompobulu sub-districts denotes minus values. This implies the facts that maize cultivation is still practiced on the land that is ecologically not suitable, where steep slope is the dominant limiting factor. </p...|$|R

40|$|In South Sulawesi, {{the program}} <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> {{development}} (called Gong) {{has recently been}} implemented by the provincial government, as part of promoting regional food security program. In {{some parts of the}} region, cultivation of maize (Zea mays L.) has long been practiced in different soil environments including marginal land. To help address this phenomenon, {{there is a need for}} information that will allow land managers to identify both the inherent suitability of land <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> production and development, and the spatial distribution of land areas where possible development can be implemented taking into account present land use types. This paper describes a spatial based qualitative suitability evaluation of marginal soils <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> production and development at a region where marginal land predominates. The research project implements land suitability evaluation method based on the spatial-qualitative query approaches in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The main sources of data bases used include digital topographic map, soil map and soil characteristics derived from available data at reconnaissance level and semi detailed survey, climate data, and satellite imagery. The results of analysis of potential development <b>area</b> <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> cultivation show that more than 90 percent of study region are suitable (at S 2 and S 3 classes) <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> cultivation. Comparing to the existing maize cultivation and land use types on the ground, about one third of the <b>area</b> is available <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> cultication (extensification). This study reveals that there are some limiting factors in term of chemical soil characteristics that can still be improved, but there will be almost no limitation in terms of land cover type <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> development. This spatial based method demonstrated in this study can be further used at a micro scale where the spatial data are available with a good mapping accuracy...|$|R

Here, we develop a temporal uncertainty framework using the CMIP 5 ensemble to assess when and where cultivation of key crops in sub-Saharan Africa becomes unviable.

We envisage three overlapping adaptation phases to enable projected transformational changes: an incremental adaptation phase focused on improvements to crops and management, a preparatory phase that establishes appropriate policies and enabling environments, and a transformational adaptation phase in which farmers substitute crops, explore alternative livelihoods strategies, or relocate. To best align policies with production triggers for no-regret actions, monitoring capacities to track farming systems as well as climate are needed...|$|R

30|$|Coexistence rules, {{especially}} in minimum isolation distances, {{are designed to}} minimize conflicts due to transport of GM crop material into neighboring habitats, non-GMO fields and/or protected areas. Appropriate minimum distances should consider regional conditions. Nonetheless, although the states and counties of Germany vary in the average size of arable areas, the share of protected sites and the share of maize, we found only a marginal effect of the minimum distance to protected sites (1, 000 m) on the GM <b>area</b> available <b>for</b> cultivation. Hence, the available <b>area</b> <b>for</b> GM <b>maize</b> cultivation is not limited by minimum distances even if 70 % of the maize grown is GM. Some regions with higher shares of maize, however, exhibit increased conflict potential because the available <b>areas</b> <b>for</b> GM <b>maize</b> are almost completely needed for the shares of GM maize. Although large and fixed isolation distances usually disregard landscape specifics, our results for Germany suggest that the average shares of arable areas are not relevant and that buffering of protected areas (1, 000 m) does not limit the allocation of GM maize. Only above an overall 40 % maize share can the available <b>area</b> <b>for</b> GM not suffice if 70 % of the maize is GM.|$|R

Rain-fed agriculture supports the livelihood of majority of smallholders in Zambia. To effectively adapt to foreseeable climate change, and to decrease {{risk of the}} food crisis, we analyzed potential suitable distribution of major crops (white maize (Zea mays), cassava (Manihot esculenta) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor)) in Zambia under current and future (2080 s) climates using the MCE-GIS (multi-criteria evaluation -geographical information system) Planting Ecological Adaptability model. The simulation results indicate that climate change will change the potential suitable <b>area</b> <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> from 66. 8 % to 48. 6 %; and that of cassava from 65 % to 84 %.
