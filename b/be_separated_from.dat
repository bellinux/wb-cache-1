5|$|Woodland {{called for}} a decision; either South Sudan should <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> the north and {{administered}} as a territory {{in the same way}} as Uganda, or the British should encourage development by the Arabs within the structure of the North Sudan. Nothing was done.|$|E
5|$|A.viridimontanum is {{difficult}} to distinguish from its parent species in the field. It can generally <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> A.pedatum by {{the shape of the}} ultimate segments (the smallest divisions of the leaf), and by its habitat on thin, exposed serpentine soils rather than in rich woodlands. It more closely resembles A.aleuticum; however, the stalks of the ultimate segments and the false indusia are longer and the spores larger.|$|E
5|$|After production, the fermium must <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> other {{actinides}} {{and from}} lanthanide fission products. This is usually achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, {{with the standard}} process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex50 or TEVA eluted with a solution of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.|$|E

5|$|As the {{structure}} of the back is complex and the reporting of pain is subjective and affected by social factors, the diagnosis of low back pain is not straightforward. While most low back pain is caused by muscle and joint problems, this cause must <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> neurological problems, spinal tumors, fracture of the spine, and infections, among others.|$|E
5|$|Callie {{wants to}} take Sofia and move to New York with Penny but Arizona {{does not want to}} <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> her {{daughter}} so she hires a lawyer and they go to court for a custody battle. After a long case, Arizona wins sole custody of Sofia. but in the end she ends up sharing Sofia with Callie because she thinks that; 'both of Sofia's moms deserve to be happy'.|$|E
5|$|Like Lovinescu, other {{advocates of}} modernist {{literature}} rejected most of Cerna's contributions. One {{of the first}} to have done so is Ovid Densusianu, who stated his belief that an artist's work should <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> his life. Lovinescu, who commented on Densusianu and his thoughts on Cerna, opined that Densusianu had a tendency to reject all poets who registered popular success, and that he treated Dimitrie Anghel's work in much the same way.|$|E

5|$|Pilophorus acicularis can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> similar species by its tall pseudopodetia. It may be {{confused}} with P.robustus, especially in material from Alaska where both species occur together. Usually, the different branching (umbellate in P.robustus versus dichotomous in P.acicularis) {{and the lack of}} a columella (an internal, column-shaped structure) in longitudinal sections of the pseudopodetia of P.acicularis make it relatively easy to distinguish between the two.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{folk music}} of Jersey was common in country areas until the mid-20th century. It cannot <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> the musical traditions of continental Europe, {{and the majority}} of songs and tunes that have been documented have close parallels or variants, particularly in France. Most of the surviving traditional songs are in French, with a minority in Jèrriais.|$|E

5|$|Typically, {{if there}} is little wind shear, the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and 'rain itself out', but, {{if there is}} {{sufficient}} change in wind speed and/or direction, the downdraft will <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> the updraft, and the storm may become a supercell, where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Mycena, {{it is found}} in the section Filipedes, on account of the cheilocystidia covered with evenly spaced, short {{cylindrical}} excrescences, and its size and occurrence on wood. It can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> {{the other members of the}} section on account of a cap with yellowish to olive shades, gills with pinkish hints and stems with vaguely violet colouration.|$|E
5|$|A paper {{documenting the}} {{discovery}} was {{prepared by the}} team {{and sent to the}} journal Physical Review in March 1941, but publication was delayed until a year after the end of World War II due to security concerns. At the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product. They calculated that element 94 would be fissile, and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium, and could easily <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> it.|$|E
25|$|Typically, words <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> {{each other}} by a space. Certain morphemes (such as the plural ending '-hâ'), however, are written without a space. On a computer, they <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> the word using the zero-width non-joiner.|$|R

5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of various eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct Suillus species revealed that S.sibiricus forms a well-supported clade with S.americanus and S.umbonatus; these relationships are corroborated by a previous analysis (1996), which used a larger sampling of Suillus species to determine taxonomic {{relationships in the}} genus. Within this clade, S.umbonatus and U.S. S.sibiricus can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> {{the rest of the}} group. However, the phylogenetic relationships among the tested isolates determined from different methods of analysis are not always consistent and could not be established with confidence. In general, there is little phylogenetic divergence detected in this clade.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> the morphologically similar {{individuals}} of A.aleuticum by the greater {{length of the}} stalks on the medial ultimate segments and of the false indusia, measuring greater than 0.9mm and greater than 3.5mm, respectively, in A.viridimontanum. Spore size is also a useful character (although not easily measured in the field); the average A.viridimontanum spore measures 51.4μm in diameter. While A.aleuticum spores can reach up to 53μm, they average about 43μm. In A.aleuticum growing as a disjunct on eastern serpentine (the specimens {{most likely to be}} confused with A.viridimontanum), the rhizome is much more frequently branched, with intervals of 1.0 to 2.0mm between nodes.|$|E
5|$|Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California {{produced}} 28 μg {{of plutonium}} in the 60-inch cyclotron there in May 1941, {{and found that}} it had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time plutonium-239 had been produced in minute quantities using cyclotrons, but {{it was not possible to}} produce large quantities that way. Compton discussed with Eugene Wigner from Princeton University how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber how the plutonium produced in a reactor might <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> uranium.|$|E

5|$|For the {{production}} of pure chromium, the iron must <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> the chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated {{with a mixture of}} calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe2O3. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the chromates and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by sulfuric acid into the dichromate.|$|E

5|$|It is {{relatively}} {{difficult to separate}} ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides. The solution is then applied to a resin, which different lanthanides bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to {{the different types of}} bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides, it is possible to isolate the compounds.|$|E
