5|$|This is {{a variant}} of the special purpose weapon adopted by USSOCOM. The program, which led to both the Mk 46 and Mk 48, was headed by the US Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWAR). Like the SPW, the barrel {{changing}} handle, magazine insertion well, and vehicle mounting lugs have been removed to save weight. However, the Mk 46 retains the standard M249 plastic <b>buttstock</b> instead of the collapsible <b>buttstock</b> used on the SPW. The Picatinny rail forearm differs slightly from the SPW. The Mk 46 has the option of using the lighter SPW barrel or a thicker, fluted barrel of the same length.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} squad {{automatic weapon}} in Afghanistan is the M249 with PIP kit, which serves alongside its heavier counterpart, the M240 machine gun. Most M249s {{were given a}} collapsible <b>buttstock</b> immediately prior to the invasion to reduce its length and make the weapons more practical for parachuting and close-quarters combat. Special Operations troops typically favor the shorter Para version of the weapon, which weighs much less.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{maintenance program}} intended {{to extend the}} service lives of M249s {{has been carried out}} to refurbish rifles, especially units that suffered from wear due to heavy use. In particular the warping of the receiver rails on the early-models was a defect that occurred in heavily used first-generation M249s. This defect however has been completely eliminated on later models and is no longer present on the current-issue M249, which has reinforced rails and full-length welding rather than spot welding. Also being worked on is replacement of the M249's <b>buttstock</b> with a redesigned adjustable stock.|$|E
50|$|Both guns feature side-folding <b>buttstocks,</b> {{made from}} thin steel tubes, and both guns feature flip-up sights. The MPL has 100 and 200 meter settings.|$|R
25|$|There {{were six}} {{different}} types of Galil folding stock (not including the Micro or Galatz models) that were utilized over time on the Galil and R4 series of weapons. Wooden AK47 type <b>buttstocks</b> were also offered by request, although none {{are known to have}} been used by any militaries and were mostly relegated to the civilian market.|$|R
5000|$|Decades later, in 1986, H&R {{closed their}} doors and the Numrich Arms Corporation (The Gun Parts) {{purchased}} their entire inventory. Acquiring {{a number of}} Model 50 receivers, Numrich assembled them with parts. These weapons all have an [...] "S" [...] preceding the serial number and were sold domestically in the early 1990s after reparkerization and fitting with newly manufactured walnut stocks. These stocks are distinguished from originals by their wider than normal sling swivels and <b>buttstocks,</b> by the fact they have no stock ties, and have H&R marked plastic buttplates (originals were unmarked metal).|$|R
25|$|The lower {{receiver}} incorporates the magazine well, the pistol grip and the <b>buttstock.</b> The {{lower receiver}} also contains the trigger, disconnector, hammer and fire selector (collectively {{known as the}} fire control group). Full-sized rifles use a fixed <b>buttstock,</b> while carbines generally use an adjustable telescoping <b>buttstock.</b>|$|E
25|$|The bracket and knuckle {{assemblies}} feature camming surfaces {{that allow}} the emergency unfolding of the stock by simply pulling the <b>buttstock</b> rearwards, however this should generally be avoided as it will wear down the mechanism rapidly over time, and lead to the stock wobbling in both positions.|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon was}} {{modified}} with a two-stage trigger mechanism with an adjustable pull force, a wooden <b>buttstock</b> that folds {{to the right}} side of the weapon and a heavy-duty bipod, mounted to the forward base of the receiver housing that folds beneath the handguard when not in use. The <b>buttstock</b> is fully adjustable in length and height and features a variable-height cheek riser. The rifle comes with mechanical iron sights and an adapter used to mount a telescopic day sight (Nimrod 6×40) or a night sight. The mount is quick-detachable and capable of retaining zero after remounting. The precision rifle is stored in a rugged transport case that comes with an optical sight, mount, filters, two slings (for carrying and firing) and a cleaning kit. Recent production models feature synthetic plastic furniture and a skeletonized metal stock.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2016 {{revision}} of the Civilian Marksmanship Program's [...] "Competition Rules for Service Rifle and Pistol", use of a magnification optic has been authorized, intended to represent {{the use of the}} Rifle Combat Optic (RCO) on today's M-16 and M-4 service rifles. Magnified optics are limited to a maximum 4.5x power, and can be of the fixed magnification or variable-zoom type. These optics will also be allowed during the National Matches, hosted in Camp Perry, Ohio. Use of collapsible <b>buttstocks</b> has also been allowed in the 2016 revision.|$|R
50|$|H&K offers {{dedicated}} training {{variants of}} these weapons, designated MP5A4PT and MP5A5PT (PT—Plastic Training), modified {{to fire a}} plastic 9×19mm PT training cartridge produced by Dynamit Nobel of Germany. These weapons operate like the standard MP5 but have a floating chamber and both rollers have been omitted from the bolt to function properly when firing the lighter plastic projectiles. To help identify these weapons blue dots were painted on their cocking handles and additional lettering provided. The PT variant can be configured with various <b>buttstocks</b> and trigger groups and was developed for the West German Police and Border Guard.|$|R
5000|$|The IMBEL MD97 {{assault rifle}} family was {{developed}} to replace IMBEL MD-2 and MD-3 rifles that were in use with the Brazilian military. The MD-97 {{is based on the}} MD-2, but has a number of improvements. The IMBEL MD-97 assault rifle family consists of three models with different dimensions and weight. The MD-97 family can be fed from standard STANAG magazines. Assault rifles are available with fixed or folding <b>buttstocks.</b> Rifles can be equipped with accessories such as sound suppressors and optical sights. The barrel life is a relatively short 6,000 rounds. The MD-97 also has a brass deflector.|$|R
25|$|The 1928 Thompson {{would be}} the last small arm adopted by the U.S. Army that used a year {{designation}} in the official nomenclature. With the start of World War II, major contracts from several countries saved the manufacturer from bankruptcy. A notable variant of the Model 1928 with an aluminum receiver and tenite grip, <b>buttstock,</b> and forend, was made by Savage.|$|E
25|$|Models {{used in the}} Pacific by Australian {{troops had}} their sling swivels remounted {{on the left side}} to allow it to be fired more easily while prone. A metal sling mount was fitted to {{the left side of the}} wooden <b>buttstock.</b> Ammunition was {{manufactured}} in Australia or obtained from adjacent American troops. It was later replaced by the Owen Machine Carbine.|$|E
25|$|Fitted {{with a new}} chassis (stock) {{assembly}} that maximizes {{the amount}} of physical adjustments for the sniper to provide a better user customized fit. The chassis has a right folding <b>buttstock</b> that shortens the system for easier transport and better concealment during movement and accommodates the mounting of accessories via removable Mil Std 1913 Picatinny Rails and accessory cables via routing channels.|$|E
50|$|The Spectre M4 is an Italian submachine {{gun that}} was {{produced}} by the SITES factory in Turin. It was designed by Roberto Teppa and Claudio Gritti in the mid-1980s. Production in Italy ceased in the year 1997, with the closure of SITES, but proceeded in very small numbers in Switzerland through Greco Sport S.A., a company founded by Gritti, until 2001. The Spectre is a compact and light weapon, designed for instant firepower in close combat at short ranges. The four models have top-folding <b>buttstocks,</b> and were available {{with or without a}} forward handgrip ahead of the magazine housing. The largely polymer Spectre has a stamped-steel receiver.|$|R
5000|$|Some viewers {{also criticized}} one {{particular}} scene where NRA soldiers surround and bash a Japanese Type 95 Ha-Go tank with dadaos and <b>buttstocks,</b> calling {{the scene as}} [...] "ridiculous" [...] and [...] "degrading to fallen soldiers". However, this is historically factual as many National Revolutionary Army soldiers (especially those from local armed forces) were illiterate conscripts who had never seen tanks previously. The NRA also lacked sufficient anti-tank weapons, leaving its troopers often resort to desperate and extreme measures {{to fight against the}} enemy. One Japanese painting named [...] "The desperate fight of the mini-tank" [...] specifically portrayed Chinese soldiers charging a stalled tank with their bayonets.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} Contender is {{now known}} as the generation one (G1) Contender and was replaced by the G2 Contender in 1998. The new design is dimensionally the same as the original Contender, but uses an Encore-style trigger group. Due to the changes in the trigger mechanism, and to differences in the angle of the grip relative to the boreline of the gun, the <b>buttstocks</b> and pistol grips are different between the G1 and G2 Contenders and will not interchange. The G2 uses essentially the same barrels and fore-ends as the original Contender and barrels will interchange, with the only two exceptions being the G2 muzzleloading barrels, which will only fit the G2 frame, and the Herrett barrels/fore-ends, which are specific for use only on a G1 frame.|$|R
25|$|The 5.56mm Conventional Multirole Combat Rifle (CMCR) was {{released}} during the Singapore Airshow 2014. Equipped {{with a unique}} adjustable and foldable <b>buttstock,</b> the CMCR provides ease and comfort for soldiers to manipulate in tight spaces. The CMCR is designed to fire NATO SS109 5.56mm ammunition and ST Kinetics’ Extended Range 5.56mm ammunition, and come standard with MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny Rails at the three, six, nine and 12 o’clock positions.|$|E
25|$|The G36 is a selective-fire 5.56 mm assault rifle, firing from {{a closed}} rotary bolt. The G36 has a {{conventional}} layout and a modular component design. Common to all variants of the G36 family are: {{the receiver and}} <b>buttstock</b> assembly, bolt carrier group with bolt and the return mechanism and guide rod. The receiver contains the barrel, carry handle with integrated sights, trigger group with pistol grip, handguard and magazine socket.|$|E
25|$|The Tantal {{features}} a metal wire side-folding stock (folds {{to the right}} side), ended with a profiled shoulder pad. The rifle can also use a fixed wooden or synthetic <b>buttstock</b> designed for AKM or AK-74 rifles. Both {{the upper and lower}} handguard and pistol grip are fabricated from bakelite, although a limited number of Tantal-specific black polymer handguards and pistol grips have also been produced. Most handguards designed for use with the wz. 1996 Beryl assault rifle may also be installed on the Tantal.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Contender, {{now known}} as the generation one (G1) Contender, was replaced by the G2 Contender soon after the Encore came out. The G2 Contender is essentially dimensionally the same as the original Contender, but uses an Encore style trigger group. Due to the changes in the trigger mechanism, and to differences in the angle of the grip relative to the boreline of the gun, the <b>buttstocks</b> and pistol grips are different between the G1 and G2 Contenders and will not interchange. The G2, though, uses essentially the same barrels and fore-ends as the original Contender and barrels will interchange, with the only two exceptions being the G2 muzzleloading barrels, which will only fit the G2 frame, and the Herrett barrels/fore-ends, which are specific for use only on a G1 frame.|$|R
5000|$|Stock: A {{variety of}} M4 {{retractable}} <b>buttstocks</b> are {{used on a}} standard 4-position receiver extension, including the standard [...] "CAR" [...] stock. Most often seen is the SOPMOD stock, {{often referred to as}} the [...] "Crane stock", created by Dave Armstrong of NSWC-Crane. The angled stock offers better cheekweld as well as providing two storage compartments for spare batteries. The stock must be removed from the weapon to access the storage compartments. The initial run of stocks was made by NSWC-Crane from glass fiber polymer. Because of this, they were somewhat fragile and did not always properly lock into the receiver extension. A rubber band was used to secure the latch so it would not slide out of the desired position. The current L7LA2B SOPMOD stocks are made by Lewis Machine & Tools and have none of these problems.|$|R
5000|$|Browning Citoris {{come in all}} of {{the popular}} shotgun shell gauges, and are made in an over-under [...] "stacked" [...] barrel configuration, with forends and <b>buttstocks</b> made from high quality walnut wood. Barrel lengths can be {{purchased}} from 26 inches for skeet shooting to 32 inches for sporting clays and trap shooting. The top barrel has a vented rib attached by soldering for {{the entire length of the}} barrel tube. Newer Citori internal barrels are chrome-lined for added surface strength. All metal parts are bright blued for the standard model. [...] "In-the-white" [...] higher grade models with more elaborate machine-applied engraving can also be purchased. Rubber recoil butt pads (12 gauge) or plastic butt plates (sub-gauges) are standard. Citori actions are made with internal hammers and coil springs and all Citori models have shell ejectors, which expel spent shells when the breech is opened by pressing aside the top lever and bending the action fully open, which also re-cocks the internal hammers.|$|R
25|$|The Squad Designated Marksman Rifle (SDMR) is a mid-length carbine {{similar in}} {{configuration}} to the SEAL Recon Rifle. It features a railed upper receiver, a mid-length gas system, a Daniel Defense 16-inch cold-hammer forged barrel, a Daniel Defense free-floating railed handguard, a 4x32 Trijicon Advanced Combat Optic, a Magpul STR <b>buttstock,</b> a Hogue grip containing a cleaning kit and a cerakote finish. An initial batch of forty (40) units of this more compact squad designated marksman rifle variant were {{turned over to}} selected AFP Special Operations Forces (SOF) and the Scout Rangers for testing and evaluation.|$|E
25|$|After adoption, the FAMAS F1 {{replaced}} {{both the}} aging MAS 49/56 rifle and MAT-49 submachine gun. Approximately 400,000 FAMAS F1 assault rifles were produced by MAS. While a capable rifle, the F1 had numerous problems to overcome. For instance, many plastic {{pieces on the}} rifle easily broke, including critical parts like the cheek riser on the <b>buttstock.</b> The FAMAS was also susceptible to malfunction on occasion because of poorly-built, or rather improperly used, magazines. The FAMAS was designed around the concept of single-use, disposable magazines; when the limited budget of the French military forced soldiers to reuse disposable magazines over and over, the FAMAS would jam and require immediate attention. MAS would eventually manufacture more durable magazines for the FAMAS that reduced malfunctions.|$|E
25|$|The SG 550 has a side-folding {{skeletonized}} <b>buttstock</b> (folds to {{the right}} side of the receiver) and a lightweight aluminium bipod that folds into grooves in the lower handguard. The hinged stock is firmly locked in the folded position by a socket in the butt which clips into a plastic stud on the handguard; a firm pull will release the stock which is then swung into the closed position and locked by a button catch. A collapsible side-folding stock is also available. The stock, pistol grip, and handguards are made of a high-strength polymer, and are produced in either green or black colour options. The steel receiver housing and several other components are manufactured using stamping and welding; external steel surfaces are finished with a ceramic-reinforced enamel coat known as Ilaflon. The gas system's components are made of stainless steel. The barrel, bolt, bolt carrier, and firing pin are all made with steel that has been gas nitrided, hardened and tempered. The bolt and carrier, along with most other components internal to the receiver undergo a phosphating process.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} magazine housing, {{which is}} suited to accept AR-15 type magazines, has ambidextrous magazine release buttons. The ambidextrous bolt stop release button {{is located at}} the front of the triggerguard. Safety lever is also ambidextrous, and charging handle can be installed on either side of the gun. It can be equipped with various Magpul-made <b>buttstocks,</b> fixed or side-folding, and adjustable for length of pull (some also with adjustable cheek rest), it can also be fitted with removable iron sights, and/or with any optical or night sight  with appropriate mounting, depending on the user's preference or the variant. It also has an integral Picatinny rail on the top of the receiver and additional accessory rails can be installed on forend according to user preferences. The Bushmaster's handguard model is polymer with heat guards and attachable aluminum tri-rail, while the Remington model has a five-sided aluminum handguard that can be user configured with MIL-STD-1913 rail elements.|$|R
50|$|Following a {{long series}} of tests by the U.S. Army and U.S. Air force, {{resulted}} in an order for 8,500 AR-15 (redesignated M16) rifles for the Air Force in 1962. About the same time, the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense became interested, and 1,000 rifles were procured for field test in Vietnam. Starting in 1965, Colt attempted to market the M16 rifle as a modular weapons system that could fulfill all of the various needs of an army, similar to the marketing plans for the AR-10, its predecessor, and the Stoner 63, its rival. In order to compete with the Stoner 63 which could be converted into a belt-fed light or medium machine gun, Colt also included the short-lived CMG-1 and CMG-2 machine guns in the CAR-15 Military Weapons System, though the CMG-1 and CMG-2 had few parts in common with the CAR-15s. By using various upper assemblies, <b>buttstocks,</b> and pistol grips, the weapon could be configured as an assault rifle, a heavy-barreled automatic rifle, a carbine, a submachine gun, or as a survival rifle.|$|R
50|$|Some Portuguese-model AR-10s were {{fitted with}} A.I.-modified upper {{receivers}} {{in order to}} mount 3× or 3.6× telescopic sights. These rifles were used by marksmen accompanying small patrols to eliminate individual enemies at extended ranges in open country. Other AR-10s were used by the paratroopers in a secondary role to launch rifle grenades. The AR-10's built-in gas cutoff design enabled it to fire Energa rifle grenades without adjustment of the gas system, and the self-loading action would even eject the spent blank shells and load the next one, allowing several grenades to be quickly fired. The added recoil took its toll on rifle stocks, and some Portuguese rifles were retrofitted with all-metal <b>buttstocks</b> to better withstand the strain caused by firing the heavy grenades. Additional sales of the AR-10 rifle were stymied after the Netherlands embargoed further shipments of the rifle to Portugal. Paratroopers deploying to Africa in later years were subsequently issued a collapsible stock version of the German Heckler & Koch G3 rifle. Nevertheless, the AR-10 continued in service with a few Portuguese airborne units, and was in use as late as 1975 in the Portuguese Timor (East Timor) decolonization emergency.|$|R
500|$|The M249 Paratrooper, {{often called}} [...] "Para", is a compact {{version of the}} gun with a shorter barrel and sliding {{aluminum}} <b>buttstock</b> based on that of the Minimi Para, so-called because of its intended use by airborne troops. It is much shorter and considerably lighter than the regular M249 at [...] long and [...] in weight. The Army's Rapid Fielding Initiative {{is in the process}} of replacing the original collapsible <b>buttstock</b> with an adjustable model based loosely on the design of the M4 carbine <b>buttstock.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The entry shotgun or {{breaching}} shotgun is a {{role that}} can be filled by a standard riot shotgun, or one further modified for these purposes. They may have an extremely short barrel (14" [...] or less) and often only a pistol grip rather than a <b>buttstock,</b> or a folding or collapsing <b>buttstock</b> if it is provided with one. In addition, the barrel often has a muzzle brake, used to disperse hot gases {{that might otherwise be}} deflected toward the shooter. This type of shotgun is designed to fire special breaching rounds which are designed to disable or destroy door latches while limiting overpenetration of the projectiles used beyond the door. Since these shotguns would in most areas be classified as short barreled shotguns, they are highly restricted under gun control laws such as the National Firearms Act and generally only used by police and military.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to import}} restrictions, the American {{civilian}} market required a partially American-made version assembled by SIG SAUER, Inc. in Exeter, New Hampshire. The SIG556 {{is designed to}} meet these requirements. The 556 lacks full-auto capability and the overall length is [...] One difference is a new aluminum lower receiver that accepts M16 STANAG magazines and an M4 telescoping <b>buttstock.</b> The barrel's twist rate is 178mm (1:7 in).|$|E
5000|$|Brazil took {{delivery}} of a small quantity of FN-made FAL rifles for evaluation as early as 1954. Troop field testing was performed with FN made FALs between 1958 and 1962. Then, in 1964, Brazil officially adopted the rifle, designating the rifle M964 for 1964. Licensed production started shortly thereafter at the Indústria de Material Bélico do Brasil (IMBEL), in Itajubá {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais. The folding stock version was designated M964A1. By the late 1980s/early 1990s, IMBEL had manufactured some 200,000 M964 rifles. Later Brazilian made FALs have Type 3, hammer forged receivers. Early FN made FALs for Brazil are typical FN 1964 models with Type 1 or Type 2 receivers, plastic stock, handguard, and pistol grip, 22 mm cylindrical flash hider for grenade launching, and plastic model [...] "D" [...] carrying handle. Brazilian-made FALs are thought to have been exported to Uruguay. A heavy barrel version, known as the FAP (Fuzil Automático Pesado, or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, {{to be used as a}} squad automatic weapon.Brazil's planned service weapon was a development of the FAL in 5.56×45mm. Known as the MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, it was also manufactured by IMBEL. The first prototype, the MD-1, came out around 1983. In 1985, the MD-2 was presented and adopted by the Military Police. Its new 5.56×45mm NATO chambering aside, the MD-2/MD-3 is still very similar to the FAL and externally resembles it, changes include a change in the locking system, which was replaced by an M16-type rotating bolt. The MD-2 and MD-3 use STANAG magazines, but have different <b>buttstocks.</b> The MD-2 features a FN 50.63 'para' side-folding stock, while the MD-3 uses the same fixed polymer stock of the standard FAL.|$|R
2500|$|Troy Industries {{has created}} {{a replica of the}} EBR's modular system made by Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division called the Troy Modular Chassis System, which can be used by {{mounting}} any functioning M1A or M14 rifle on the MCS. [...] Philippine arms company FERFRANS has created their version of the Mk 14 Mod 0 called the FERFRANS SOPMOD M14/M1A Enhanced Battle Rifle, which uses a Sage International M14/M1A EBR Tactical Stock System aluminum chassis, an M4 <b>buttstock,</b> and a GRSC M4-62 General Purpose Combat Recticle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} stock {{found on}} the Galil is a rough-copy of the FN-FAL Paratrooper stock, with modifications for simpler production and ease of use. Unlike the FAL folding stock, the Galil uses no locking button and is operated entirely by a pin and spring pivoting mechanism; to fold the stock, the [...] "L" [...] bracket on the stock portion is pressed down to where the spring is fully compressed and the entire stock is allowed to pivot on the <b>buttstock</b> hinge. The same operation is done for unfolding to the stock to the open-position.|$|E
