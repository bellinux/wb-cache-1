5|$|In the 1980s, the USAF {{began looking}} for a {{replacement}} for its fighter aircraft, especially to counter the USSR's advanced Sukhoi Su-27 and Mikoyan MiG-29. Several companies submitted design proposals; the USAF selected proposals from Northrop and Lockheed. Northrop teamed with McDonnell Douglas to develop the YF-23, while Lockheed, <b>Boeing</b> <b>and</b> General Dynamics developed the YF-22.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 2010, {{five months}} after the Court of Inquiry was constituted, it {{submitted}} its report with input from the NTSB and <b>Boeing,</b> <b>and</b> stated that pilot error was the cause of the accident since the flight path was incorrect.|$|E

5|$|The {{replacement}} of the Mk1's metal rotor blades with aluminium and glass fibre composite rotor blades saw these aircraft designated Chinook HC Mk1B.

Since 2008, nations operating the older AH-64A have been urged to undertake modernization programs to become AH-64Ds, as <b>Boeing</b> <b>and</b> the U.S. Army plans to terminate support for the A-variants in the near future.|$|E

By the late 1990s, TAP had expanded its fleet by selling its older <b>Boeing</b> 727s <b>and</b> <b>Boeing</b> 737s, <b>and</b> had {{replaced them with}} Airbus A319, A320 and A321 aircraft. The TriStars were sold to Air Luxor and were replaced by Airbus A340s, giving TAP an Airbus-only fleet.|$|R
5|$|The ICAO investigation, led by Caj Frostell, did {{not have}} the {{authority}} to compel the states involved to hand over evidence, instead having to rely on what they voluntarily submitted. Consequently, the investigation {{did not have}} access to sensitive evidence such as radar data, intercepts, ATC tapes, or the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) (whose discovery the U.S.S.R. had kept secret). A number of simulations were conducted with the assistance of <b>Boeing</b> <b>and</b> Litton (the manufacturer of the navigation system).|$|E

5|$|Upon {{receipt of}} {{regulatory}} approval, EVA Airways Corporation was formally established in March 1989. The airline was originally {{to be called}} Evergreen Airways, however this was deemed too similar to the unrelated Evergreen International cargo airline. In October 1989, the newly formed EVA Airways Corporation placed a US$3.6 billion order for 26 aircraft from <b>Boeing</b> <b>and</b> McDonnell Douglas, including Boeing 747-400 and MD-11 airliners.|$|E
5|$|At {{the inauguration}} of its new {{assembly}} line, the 767's order backlog numbered approximately 50, only enough for production to last until 2013. Despite the reduced backlog, Boeing officials expressed optimism that additional orders would be forthcoming. On February 24, 2011, the USAF announced its selection of the KC-767 Advanced Tanker, an upgraded variant of the KC-767, for its KC-X fleet renewal program. The selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between <b>Boeing</b> <b>and</b> Airbus parent EADS, and came eight years after the USAF's original 2003 announcement of its plan to lease KC-767s. The tanker order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 2013.|$|E
5|$|British {{aircraft}} manufacturer Avro built {{a factory in}} south Chadderton in 1938–39, later known as BAE Chadderton. It {{was one of the}} largest employers in the area, producing a variety of aircraft models including Ansons, Manchesters and Bristol Blenheims. During the Second World War, 3,050 Avro Lancaster bombers were built at the Chadderton factory—over 40percent of the Royal Air Force's fleet. Post World War Two the Avro Vulcan was designed and built, as well as the Avro Shackleton and Avro Lincoln. After the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977, Avro became part of the nationalised British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) and produced commercial aircraft for <b>Boeing</b> <b>and</b> Airbus.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{initial safety}} concerns, DC-10 {{aircraft}} continued {{to serve with}} passenger airlines for over 30 years after the crash of Flight 191. In the end, it was newer, more fuel-efficient twin-engined airplanes from <b>Boeing</b> <b>and</b> Airbus and not safety concerns that ultimately ended the passenger career of the DC-10. Many retired passenger DC-10s have since been converted to all-cargo use. DC-10 freighters, along with its derivative, the MD-11, form {{the backbone of the}} FedEx Express fleet. The DC-10s have been upgraded with the glass cockpit from the MD-11, thereby turning them into MD-10s. American Airlines retired its last DC-10s in 2000 after 29 years of service. In February 2014, Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated the final DC-10 passenger flights. DC-10s continue to be used extensively in air freight operations, and military variants also remain in service.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and 1960s, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{provided}} {{universities and colleges}} with grants to acquire small nuclear reactors for research programs. The University of Washington began nuclear engineering classes {{as part of the}} College of Engineering in 1953, and formed a Department of Nuclear Engineering in 1956, accepting engineers from <b>Boeing</b> <b>and</b> the nearby Hanford Site as its first students. The Nuclear Engineering department used training reactors at Bagley Hall and later proposed that the university acquire a nuclear reactor to be installed on-campus. In 1957, the AEC approved $100,000 in funding for the University of Washington to install a permanent nuclear reactor on the campus, {{the first of its kind}} in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In March 1993, {{under the}} September 1990 Tripartite MoU between the U.S., Italy, and Spain, eight EAV-8B Plus Matadors were ordered, {{along with a}} twin-seat TAV-8B. Deliveries of the Plus-standard {{aircraft}} started in 1996. On 11 May 2000, <b>Boeing</b> <b>and</b> the NAVAIR finalized a contract to remanufacture Spanish EAV-8Bs to bring them up to Plus standard. Boeing said the deal required it to remanufacture two EAV-8Bs, with an option for another seven aircraft; other sources say the total was 11 aircraft. The remanufacture allowed the aircraft to carry four AIM-120 AMRAAMs, enhanced the pilot's situational awareness through the installation of new radar and avionics, and provided a new engine. Eventually, five aircraft were modified, the last having been delivered on 5 December 2003.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, the USAF {{began looking}} for a {{replacement}} for its fighter aircraft, especially to counter the advanced Su-27 and MiG-29. A number of companies, divided into two teams, submitted their proposals. Northrop and McDonnell Douglas submitted the YF-23. Lockheed, <b>Boeing</b> <b>and</b> General Dynamics proposed and built the YF-22, which, although marginally slower and having a larger radar cross-section, was more agile than the YF-23. Primarily for this reason, it was picked by the Air Force as {{the winner of the}} ATF in April 1991. Following the selection, the first YF-22 was retired to a museum, while the second prototype continued flying until an accident relegated it to the role of an antenna test vehicle.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, <b>Boeing</b> <b>and</b> BAE Systems assumed {{management}} of the Harrier family following corporate mergers that saw Boeing acquire McDonnell Douglas and BAe amalgamate with other defense companies to form BAE Systems. Between 1969 and 2003, 824 Harriers of all models were delivered. In 2001, Flight International reported that Taiwan might meet its requirement for a short take off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft by purchasing AV-8Bs, outfitted with the F-16 Fighting Falcon's APG-66 radar. A Taiwanese purchase would have allowed the production line to stay open beyond 2005. Despite the possibility of leasing AV-8Bs, interest in the aircraft waned as the country switched its intentions to procuring the F-35 and upgrading its fleet of F-16s.|$|E
5|$|When Airbus {{designed}} the Airbus A300 {{during the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against <b>Boeing</b> <b>and</b> Douglas, two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B {{in support of this}} long-term goal. Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, engineers within Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9. A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10. It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.|$|E
