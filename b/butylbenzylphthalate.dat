40|$|A routine method {{which is}} simple, quick and precise {{has been set}} up and {{validated}} for phthalate analysis in environmental samples (tomato plants and sewage sludges). Six phthalates have been studied simultaneously: dimethylphthalate, diethylphthalate, dibutylphthalate, <b>butylbenzylphthalate,</b> di(ethyl) hexylphthalate and dioctylphthalate. Optimization of sample, solvent extraction uses a Soxtec apparatus and extract purification with an SPE cartridge allows between 90 to 110...|$|E
40|$|Juvenile {{rainbow trout}} were given {{intraperitoneal}} (IP) injections of (i) octylphenol (OP) and <b>butylbenzylphthalate</b> (BBP) or (ii) octylphenol and estradiol (E). Both pairs of compounds were administered singly and in combination, at two different dose levels. Modulation of the hepatic estradiol receptor (ER) binding capacity and induction of hepatic zona radiata proteins (Zrp) were utilised {{as indicators of}} estrogenic effect. In treatment (i) OP caused a significant (approx 2 -fold) upregulation of the ER and a significant (approx 3 - 5 fold) increase in Zrp at both doses compared to control, vehicle-injected fish. In contrast, {{no effect on the}} ER was observed in BBP-treated fish, but plasma Zrp levels were significantly reduced. No synergistic effect was observed on ER modulation or Zrp induction in fish receiving OP and BBP in combination. In treatment (ii) both OP and E caused a significant (approx 2 -fold) upregulation of the ER and a significant (approx 6 - 7 fold) increase in plasma Zrp at both dose levels compared to controls. The effect of OP and E in combination, on both ER modulation and induction of Zrp, was additive and not synergistic...|$|E
40|$|Phthalate {{concentrations}} (di-(2 -ehtylhexyl) phthalate, dibutylphthalate and <b>butylbenzylphthalate</b> {{were measured}} in the neighbourhood of phthalate-emitting plants and in unpolluted areas in soil and maiza. Special emphasis was given to differentiate between deposition and contamination via the soil-root pathway. Therefore the environmental analysis program was extended by model experiments. Plots were fertilized with phthalatecontaining sewage sludge prior to the cultivation of maize, oats and potatoes. In another experiment plants were exposed to phthalate-treated dust. Degradation and uptake by plants of the three phthalates were studied. The results show that phthalates are general air contaminants {{and can be found}} in unpolluted areas, too. The concentrations ranged from background levels to peak values of 490 mg/kg for DEHP and 560 mg/kg for DBP in soil and 20 ppm DBP in plants. The model experiments suggest that surface accumulation of phthalates in plants and transport of the substa nces into other parts of the plants was not detectable. Uptake of phthalates via the soil path was not detected, either. The results confirm that the accumulation of airborne phthalates in plant cuticles may be an important path, whereas the biovailability of phthalates in soil and from leaves can be ignored...|$|E
40|$|Contamination of {{phthalates}} plasticisers to {{food has}} raised concern {{as some of}} the phthalates are suspected to be endocrine disruptors. The phthalates have high affinity with oily environment and analysing these chemicals in such matrices is difficult because of the trace amount of the analyte and interference from matrix. An online solid phase extraction (SPE) technique using a large volume (3. 5 [*]mL) injection was developed for the analysis of 6 common plasticisers in palm oil. A simple sample preparation involving alumina as a fat retainer and methanol[*]:[*]acetonitrile (1 [*]:[*] 1) as the extraction solvent was performed prior to the usage of online SPE-LC system. This system consists of two columns, C 16 for the solid phase extraction (SPE) and C 18 as the analytical column, and a photo diode array detector. The calibration curves were linear from 5 to 1000 [*]μg[*]L− 1, with correlation coefficients above 0. 99. The instrumental limit of detection was 3 [*]μg[*]L− 1 and satisfactory recovery was obtained. A screening on a few samples in the retail market revealed the presence of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and <b>butylbenzylphthalate</b> (BBP) in the palm oil, with concentration less than 1 [*]mg[*]L− 1...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare results {{obtained}} by eight different short-term assays of estrogenlike actions of chemicals conducted in 10 different laboratories in five countries. Twenty chemicals were selected to represent direct-acting estrogens, compounds with estrogenic metabolites, estrogenic antagonists, and a known cytotoxic agent. Also included in the test panel were 1 7,Bestradiol as a positive control and ethanol as solvent control. The test compounds were coded before distribution. Test methods included direct binding to the estrogen receptor (ER), proliferation of MCF- 7 cells, transient reporter gene expression in MCF- 7 cells, reporter gene expression in yeast strains stably transfected with the human ER and an estrogen-responsive reporter gene, and vitellogenin production in juvenile rainbow trout. 17 p-Estradiol, 177 a-ethynyl estradiol, and diethylstilbestrol induced a strong estrogenic response in all test systems. Colchicine caused cytotoxicity only. Bisphenol A induced an estrogenic response in all assays. The results obtained for the remaining test compounds-tamoxifen, ICI 182. 780, testosterone, bisphenol A dimethacrylate, 4 -n-octylphenol, 4 -n-nonylphenol, nonylphenol dodecylethoxylate, <b>butylbenzylphthalate,</b> dibutylphthalate, methoxychlor, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, endosulfan, chlomequat chloride, and ethanol-varied among the assays.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the migration of monomers and plastic additives in microwave heated homemade courses and in packed liquid food. Compounds studied were 3 phthalates, 4 - tert-octylphenol (OP), 4 -nonylphenol (NP), bisphenol A (BPA) and di(2 -ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA). A QuEChERS based method was optimized for the analysis of these compounds in solid or liquid packed and retailed food. Using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, recoveries ranged from 49 ± 16 % (OP) to 130 ± 16 % (BPA) and from 63 ± 22 % (OP) to 127 ± 29 % (NP) in solid and liquid foods, with limits of detection below 14. 37 ng g- 1 and 2. 25 ng mL- 1, respectively. NP showed the highest mean level in homemade foods (1064 ± 363 ng g- 1 wet weight) and reheating did not produce an increase in the levels detected. Phthalates and DEHA were detected at low concentrations. Among liquid foods, meat broth mean concentrations of NP were of 9. 61 ± 1. 93 ng mL- 1 and of 9. 68 ± 1. 75 ng mL- 1 for <b>butylbenzylphthalate</b> in fish broth, while in wine, the most abundant compound was di-n-butylphthalate. Overall, the developed QuEChERS method permitted to determine the presence of investigated chemicals in packed food allowing the evaluation of compounds that can affect food quality...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{endocrine}} disruption has, {{in view of}} human risk assessment, raised the question on whether more sensitive test methods are needed to detect the reproductive toxic properties of xenobiotic compounds with endocrine properties. We studied six known and alleged endocrine disruptors in an existing reproductive toxicology screening test {{to see if this}} test would score these compounds as reproductive toxicants. The protocol involves parental dosage from two weeks prenatally to 6 days postnatally for dams, and a total of 28 days exposure in sires. Compounds tested were the contraceptive Ethynylestradiol, the phytoestrogen Coumestrol, the surfactant 4 -Tert-octylphenol, the plastic monomer Bisphenol A, the fungicide Vinclozolin, and the plasticizer <b>Butylbenzylphthalate.</b> Compound dosage was chosen on the basis of relative potency at the estrogen receptor level. Therefore, apart from ethynylestradiol all compounds were tested at dosages much higher than any likely exposure to be expected in humans. Five compounds were clearly scored as reproductive toxicants, affecting one or more parameters such as fertility, luteinization, spermatogenesis and fetal development. 4 -Tert-octylphenol appeared lethal at the dosage selected and had little effect at a tenfold lower dosage. These data suggest that endocrine disruptors are likely to be effective in existing reproductive toxicity test systems used for human risk evaluation. Endocrine properties of xenobiotic compounds, assessed at the hormone receptor level, should be combined with in vivo data on their reproductive and general toxicity for proper risk evaluation and risk management of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|Sediments {{may be the}} {{ultimate}} sink for persistent (xeno-) estrogenic compounds released into the aquatic environment. Sediment-associated estrogenic potency was measured with an estrogen receptor-mediated luciferase reporter gene (ER-CALUX) assay and compared with a recombinant yeast screen. The ER-CALUX assay was more sensitive to 17 beta-estradiol (E 2) than the recombinant yeast screen, with an EC 50 of 6 pM E 2 compared to 100 pM in the yeast screen. Yeast cells were unable to distinguish the anti-estrogens ICI 182 780 and (4 -hydroxy) tamoxifen, which were agonistic in the yeast. Acetone-soluble fractions of hexane/acetone extracts of sediments showed higher estrogenic potency than hexane-soluble extracts in the ER-CALUX assay. Sediments obtained from industrialized {{areas such as the}} Port of Rotterdam showed the highest estrogenic potency of the 12 marine sediments tested (up to 40 pmol estradiol equivalents per gram sediment). The estrogenic activity of individual chemicals that can be found in sediments including: alkylphenol ethoxylates and carboxylates; phthalates; and pesticides, was tested. Increasing sidechain length of various nonylphenol ethoxylates resulted in decreased estrogenic activity. Of the phthalates tested, <b>butylbenzylphthalate</b> was the most estrogenic, though with a potency approximately 100 000 times less than E 2. The organochlorine herbicides atrazine and simazine failed to induce reporter gene activity. As metabolic activation may be required to induce estrogenic activity, a metabolic transformation step was added to the ER-CALUX assay using incubation of compounds with liver microsomes obtained from PCB-treated rats. Results indicate that metabolites of E 2, NP and bisphenol A were less active than the parent compounds, while metabolites of methoxychlor were more estrogenic following microsomal incubations.

40|$|International audiencePeople {{are exposed}} to {{multiple}} pollutants, especially indoors, in particular through ingestion of indoor settled dust. In {{the perspective of a}} cumulative risk assessment, a multi-residue analytical method based on pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous analysis in indoor dust of several classes of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) of health concern, from trace to highly concentrated compounds, including musk fragrances, organochlorines (OCs), organophosphates (OPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polybromodiphenylethers (PBDEs), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), phthalates and pyrethroids. The method was validated in terms of limits of quantification (LOQ), and accuracy and precision via spiking experiments on an inert material (Celite(®) 545) and replicate analysis of the standard reference material SRM 2585 supplied by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Method LOQs for 200 mg samples of sieved dust were 26 ng g(- 1) for PCBs and some OCs, 65 ng g(- 1) for musks, OPs, PAHs, PBDEs, pyrethroids, other OCs and some phthalates, 132 ng g(- 1) for <b>butylbenzylphthalate</b> (BBP), 197 ng g(- 1) for tributylphosphate and 1579 ng g(- 1) for other phthalates. Quadratic calibration curves were established for each compound by analyzing at least five calibration solutions and exhibited determination coefficients higher than 0. 999. The method was successfully applied to the SRM 2585 and seven real indoor dust samples. The results obtained on SRM 2585 demonstrate both excellent reproducibility and agreement with the indicative, reference or certified values and provide, for the first time, indicative concentrations for chlorpyrifos, diazinon, diisononylphthalate (DiNP) and tetramethrin. The results obtained on real dust samples illustrate the ability of the proposed method to quantify a wide range of SVOCs in a single analysis, making it appropriate for environmental monitoring programs or large-scale studies with a large number of samples...|$|E
