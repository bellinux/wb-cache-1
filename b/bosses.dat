5|$|Built between 1096 and 1536, Norwich Cathedral has a Norman form, {{retaining}} {{the greater part}} of its original stone structure, which was then vaulted between 1416 and 1472 in a spectacular manner with hundreds of ornately carved, painted, and gilded <b>bosses.</b> It also has the finest Norman tower in England, surmounted by a 15th-century spire, and a large cloister with many more <b>bosses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hieronymus, in 2009, {{concluded}} that the nasal and supraorbital <b>bosses</b> were used for butting or ramming the head or the flank of a rival. The bone structure indicates that the <b>bosses</b> were covered by cornified pads as in modern muskoxen, suggesting dominance fights {{similar to those of}} members of the Caprinae subfamily. In the latter group, an evolutionary transition can be observed, where the originally straight horns become more robust, padded, and increasingly curved downwards. The evolution from horncores into <b>bosses</b> in Centrosaurinae would likewise have reflected a change in fighting technique, from clashing to high-energy head-butting. Head-butting would have been an expensive and risky behavior. Opponents would only have engaged this way after assessing each other's strengths visually. For this reason, Hieronymus considered it unlikely that the <b>bosses</b> served for species recognition as this was already guaranteed by the innate species-specific display rituals preceding a real – instead of a ritual – fight. The <b>bosses</b> would have evolved for actual combat, part of a social selection in which individuals competed for scarce resources such as mates, food and breeding grounds.|$|E

5|$|At the 1920 Republican National Convention, most of {{the delegates}} were {{selected}} by state party conventions, not primaries. As such, the field was divided among many local favorites. Coolidge was one such candidate, and while he placed as high as sixth in the voting, the powerful party <b>bosses</b> running the convention, primarily the party's U.S. Senators, never considered him seriously. After ten ballots, the <b>bosses</b> and then the delegates settled on Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio as their nominee for president. When {{the time came to}} select a vice presidential nominee, the <b>bosses</b> also made and announced their decision on whom they wanted – Sen. Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin – and then prematurely departed after his name was put forth, relying on the rank and file to confirm their decision. A delegate from Oregon, Wallace McCamant, having read Have Faith in Massachusetts, proposed Coolidge for vice president instead. The suggestion caught on quickly with the masses starving for an act of independence from the absent <b>bosses,</b> and Coolidge was unexpectedly nominated.|$|E

The Yakuza <b>boss</b> seizes the chance and puts the P38 to his head. He pulls the trigger but his gun is also empty. The Mafia <b>boss</b> swings his shotgun into the Yakuza’s stomach then discards it in favor of his switchblade. The Yakuza <b>boss</b> resorts to his sai once more. The two vigorously swing at each other, avoiding the other's weapon. The Yakuza <b>boss</b> kicks the Mafia <b>boss</b> into a boiler and charges at him, but the Mafia <b>boss</b> kicks back and pushes him away. The two recover and briefly glare at each other before resuming. Eventually, the Mafia <b>boss</b> shoves the Yakuza <b>boss</b> into the boiler and tries to stab him.

Just before the Yakuza <b>boss</b> can stab him with one of his sai, the Mafia <b>boss</b> pulls out his ice pick as a last resort and stabs the Yakuza’s arm, causing him to drop a sai. He seizes the Yakuza <b>boss</b> by his hair and slams his head into the punctured pipe, burning his face. He pulls the Yakuza <b>boss’s</b> head to the side so that his neck is exposed and slowly drives in the ice pick. The Yakuza slumps to the ground. The Mafia <b>boss</b> throws away his ice pick, lights a cigar in celebration and walks away.|$|R
