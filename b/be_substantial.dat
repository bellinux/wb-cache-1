5|$|The Allied command {{structure}} in the South West Pacific Area faced the challenges of coalition warfare in several ways, {{with varying degrees of}} success. The benefits of the wartime alliances proved to <b>be</b> <b>substantial,</b> but required constant effort to maintain. For Australia and New Zealand, coalition warfare became the norm, and the experience in SWPA proved to be a formative and informative one, with many political and military lessons. Over the following decades, Australian, New Zealand and American forces would fight together again, in the Korean War, Vietnam War and the War on Terror.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Korean War, {{a number}} of {{aircraft}} companies in both Europe and America separately decided to investigate the prospective of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, which would eliminate the requirement for vulnerable runways by taking off and landing vertically as opposed to the conventional horizontal approach. In addition to military applications, the prospect of applying such technology to commercial airliners was also viewed with considerable interest by the mid 1950s, thus the value of developing viable vertical take-off systems was judged to <b>be</b> <b>substantial.</b> However, even during this era, few companies had envisioned that a VTOL aircraft would also be realistically compatible with the characteristics of high performance military aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{there is}} often a need to correct for the {{apparent}} movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a spinning top. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as they do now. In the case of the Egyptian pyramids, it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban, a faint star in the constellation of Draco. The effect can <b>be</b> <b>substantial</b> over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation Capricorn. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E

25|$|In many coastal areas, the {{economic}} impacts {{of a wide}} beach can <b>be</b> <b>substantial.</b> The long shoreline fronting Miami Beach, Florida was replenished over the period 19761981. The project cost approximately $64,000,000 and revitalized the area's economy. Prior to nourishment, in many places the beach was too narrow to walk along, especially during high tide.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} Indian gaming statistics, {{provided}} by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC), indicate there are approximately 360 Indian gaming establishments in the United States.

25|$|The short lifetimes of many {{hedge funds}} {{means that there}} are many new {{entrants}} and many departures each year, which raises the problem of survivorship bias. If we examine only funds that have survived to the present, we will overestimate past returns because many of the worst-performing funds have not survived, and the observed association between fund youth and fund performance suggests that this bias may <b>be</b> <b>substantial.</b>|$|E
25|$|Depending upon {{seasonal}} {{weather conditions}} {{at the time of}} a major event a seismic event could be followed by urban wildfires compounded by damage to water systems or massive landslides in saturated soils. In addition to direct damage the effects on commerce due to damaged infrastructure would also <b>be</b> <b>substantial.</b> Experience with large area urban destruction such as caused by earthquake, hurricane, and firestorms has shown that complete rebuilding can take up to a decade, owing to various factors.|$|E
25|$|X-linked myotubular {{myopathy}} was traditionally a fatal {{condition of}} infancy, with {{life expectancy of}} usually less than two years. There appears to <b>be</b> <b>substantial</b> variability in the clinical severity for different genetic abnormalities at that same MTM1 gene. Further, published cases show significant differences in clinical severity among relatives with the same genetic abnormality at the MTM1 gene. Most truncating mutations of MTM1 cause a severe and early lethal phenotype, while some missense mutations are associated with milder forms and prolonged survival (up to 54 years).|$|E

25|$|Studies {{showed that}} {{chimpanzees}} and bonobos are {{more closely related}} to humans than to gorillas. In the crucial Nature paper reporting on initial genome comparisons, researchers identified 35 million single-nucleotide changes, five million insertion or deletion events, and a number of chromosomal rearrangements which constituted the genetic differences between the two Pan species and humans, covering 98% of the same genes. While many of these analyses have been performed on the common chimpanzee rather than the bonobo, {{the differences between the two}} Pan species are unlikely to <b>be</b> <b>substantial</b> enough to affect the Pan-Homo comparison significantly.|$|E
25|$|Narrow-gauge {{railways}} usually {{cost less}} to build {{because they are}} usually lighter in construction, using smaller cars and locomotives (smaller loading gauge), as well as smaller bridges, smaller tunnels (smaller structure gauge) and tighter curves. Narrow gauge is thus often used in mountainous terrain, where the savings in civil engineering work can <b>be</b> <b>substantial.</b> It is also used in sparsely populated areas where the potential demand is too low for broader gauge railways to be economically viable. This {{is the case in}} some of Australia and most of Southern Africa, where extremely poor soils have led to population densities too low for standard gauge to be viable.|$|E
25|$|Phase I {{clinical}} trials began in April 1984, {{and the decision}} to start Phase II trials was made a year later. These larger trials needed more bark and collection of a further 12,000 pounds was commissioned, which enabled some phase II trials to begin {{by the end of}} 1986. But by then it was recognized that the demand for taxol might <b>be</b> <b>substantial</b> and that more than 60,000 pounds of bark might be needed as a minimum. This unprecedentedly large amount brought ecological concerns about the impact on yew populations into focus for the first time, as local politicians and foresters expressed unease at the program.|$|E

25|$|Filburn {{argued that}} since the excess wheat he {{produced}} was intended solely for home consumption, his wheat production could not be regulated through the Interstate Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, reasoning that if Filburn had not used home-grown wheat, {{he would have had}} to buy wheat on the open market. This effect on interstate commerce, the Court reasoned, may not <b>be</b> <b>substantial</b> from the actions of Filburn alone but, through the cumulative actions of thousands of other farmers just like Filburn, its effect would certainly become substantial. Therefore, Congress could regulate wholly intrastate, non-commercial activity if such activity, viewed in the aggregate, would have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, even if the individual effects are trivial.|$|E
25|$|Brown gravy: Traditionally a {{light and}} thin chicken, veal, or turkey gravy, {{somewhat}} salty and mildly spiced {{with a hint of}} pepper, or a sauce brune which is a combination of beef and chicken stock, a variant originating in Quebec. The gravy should <b>be</b> <b>substantial,</b> but still thin enough to easily filter down into the mass of fries and cheese curds. These sauces typically also contain vinegar or a sour flavouring to balance the richness of the cheese and fries. Traditional poutine sauces (mélange à sauce poutine) are sold in Quebec, Ontario, and Maritime grocery stores in jars or cans and in powdered mix packets; some grocery chains like Sobeys even offer their own house brand versions. Many places also offer vegetarian gravy as an option to cater to vegetarians.|$|E
25|$|To reach a final {{conclusion}} on {{the choice}} for ruler Winston Churchill, then British colonial secretary, summoned {{a small group}} of Orientalists to Egypt for the famous Cairo Conference of March 1921. The British Empire’s best minds on the Middle East would determine the fate of Mesopotamia, Transjordan and Palestine. Churchill’s objectives were to save money by reducing Britain's overseas military presence; Find a way to maintain political control over Britain's mandate areas as identified in the Sykes-Picot Agreement; Protect what was then suspected to <b>be</b> <b>substantial</b> oil reserves in Iraq; and lastly preserve an open trade route to India, the Crown Jewel of the empire. Representing the Iraqis, two members of the Council were picked to join the delegation: Sassoon Eskell and Jafar Pasha al-Askari; with the disliked Sayid Talib left behind. It was at this conference, with Sassoon’s and Jafar Pasha’s approval that Emir Faisal was chosen for the throne of Iraq.|$|E
