40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a mixed integer linear optimization model, BRACAS, to help construct optimal implementation <b>schedules</b> <b>for</b> base <b>realignment</b> and closure actions. Given {{a list of}} installations <b>for</b> <b>realignment</b> and closure, BRACAS maximizes the net present value of future savings less the one-time costs while satisfying yearly budget constraints. BRACAS provides insights on {{the adequacy of the}} budget and tradeoffs between budget and savings. Modeling issues that have impact on further use of the model such as solution persistence' and alternate computation of savings are examined. With solution persistence incorporated, BRACAS is capable of generating an optimal schedule that maintains continuity with a previous schedule. Between June and August 1995 BRACAS helped the Army Base Realignment and Closure Office determine budget levels and implementation <b>schedules</b> <b>for</b> the 1995 round of base realignments and closures.
