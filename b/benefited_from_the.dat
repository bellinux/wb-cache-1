5|$|As urban populations grew, major neo-Gothic {{churches were}} built to {{accommodate}} them. After {{the passing of}} the Catholic Relief Act, James Gillespie Graham designed St Andrew's Roman Catholic Chapel in Glasgow (1814–17). There was also growth in the Episcopal Church, which <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mainly Anglican migrant English workers. In Edinburgh these were modelled on the English Perpendicular, as at St Paul's York Place (1816–18), the towered St John's Chapel (1816–18) and St David's (Ramshorn) (1824–26). In Glasgow, the Ramshorn Kirk's has a T-plan and symmetrical front with tall tower.|$|E

With the increase in population, several new districts have grown up, including Himmelev and Kongebakken. Some of the surrounding villages such as Svogerslev, Vor Frue, Vindinge and Veddelev have developed as satellite communities.|$|E

5|$|Jean Schmidt, {{a former}} member of the Ohio House, <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{conservative}} vote being split by McEwen and Tom Brinkman.

Following the primary, McEwen campaigned with Schmidt in the general election against the Democratic nominee, attorney Paul Hackett.|$|E

5|$|On a more {{practical}} level, the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was the top priority of land use. Larger farms (latifundia) achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life and its more specialized division of labour. Small farmers <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as peas and cabbage to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Pain gave {{lands to}} Llanthony Priory, helping to {{establish}} the endowment of that monastic house, although {{it is difficult to}} distinguish his gifts from those of Hugh de Lacy, as the monks of Llanthony grouped the gifts of both men together in their records. In addition Pain granted lands to Gloucester Abbey, which had <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> generosity of his father and brother, as did his wife Sybil, together with other grants to her uncle the abbot.
