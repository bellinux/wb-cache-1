40|$|UK <b>bookies</b> (bookmakers) herd {{geographically}} in less-affluent areas. The present work {{shows that}} UK <b>bookies</b> also herd {{with the special}} bets that they advertise to consumers, both in their shop window advertising and on TV adverts as shown to millions of viewers. I report an observational study of betting adverts over the 2014 soccer World Cup. Bet types vary in complexity, with complex types having the highest expected losses. <b>Bookies</b> herded on a common strategy of advertising special bets on two levels: by almost exclusively advertising complex bet types with high expected losses, and by advertising representative events within a given complex bet type. This evidence is most consistent with bookies' advertising targeting a representativeness heuristic amongst bettors. <b>Bookies</b> may know how to nudge bettors toward larger losses...|$|R

40|$|A {{large share}} of the UK {{off-course}} horse racing betting market involves winning payouts determined at Starting Prices (SP). This implies that gamblers can bet with off-course <b>bookies</b> on any horse before a race at the final pre-race odds as set by on-course <b>bookies</b> for that horse. Given the oligopolistic structure of the off-course gambling market in the UK, a market that is dominated by {{a small number of}} large bookmaking firms, we study the phenomenon of SP as a type of self-enforcing implicit collusion. We show that given the uncertainty about a race outcome, and their ability to influence the prices set by on-course <b>bookies,</b> agreeing to lay bets at SP is superior for off-course <b>bookies</b> as compared with offering fixed odds. We thus extend the results of Rotemberg and Saloner (1990) to markets with uncertainty about both demand and outcomes, We test our model by studying the predicted effects of SP betting on the behavior of on-course <b>bookies.</b> Using data drawn from both the UK and Australian on-course betting markets, we show that the differences between these markets are consistent with the predicted effects of SP betting in the UK off-course market and its absence from the Australian market. ...|$|R
