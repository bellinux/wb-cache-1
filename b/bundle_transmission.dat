40|$|Future space {{exploration}} demands a Space Network {{that will be}} able to connect spacecrafts with one another and in turn with Earth 2 ̆ 7 s terrestrial Internet and hence efficiently transfer data back and forth. The feasibility of this technology would enable common people to directly access telemetric data from distant planets and satellites. The concept of an Interplanetary Internet (IPN) is only in its incubation stage and considerable amount of common standards and research is required before widespread deployment can occur to make IPN feasible. We provide a comprehensive survey that presents a picture of the current space networking technologies and architectures. In the survey, we discuss the IPN and Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) concepts along with the various space networks that are currently deployed. We next propose a design of the IPN and implement it with the Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) software module on real time physical nodes on the ORBIT testbed. Two space network scenarios are designed and experimentally evaluated to verify the correctness of the network implementation. We also focus on the study of <b>bundle</b> <b>transmission</b> delay and separately evaluate the effect of bundle size and number of bundles. The experimental evaluation provides insights into the factors which caused delay in <b>bundle</b> <b>transmission</b> such as custody refusal, expiration of bundle lifetime and congestion.

40|$|In space {{exploration}} missions, the coordinated use of spacecraft as communication relays increases {{the efficiency of}} the endeavors. To conduct trade-off studies of the performance and resource usage of different communication protocols and network designs, JPL designed a comprehensive extendable tool, the Multi-mission Advanced Communications Hybrid Environment for Test and Evaluation (MACHETE). The design and development of MACHETE began in 2000 and is constantly evolving. Currently, MACHETE contains Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) protocol standards such as Proximity- 1, Advanced Orbiting Systems (AOS), Packet Telemetry/Telecommand, Space Communications Protocol Specification (SCPS), and the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP). MACHETE uses the Aerospace Corporation s Satellite Orbital Analysis Program (SOAP) to generate the orbital geometry information and contact opportunities. Matlab scripts provide the link characteristics. At the core of MACHETE is a discrete event simulator, QualNet. Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) is an end-to-end architecture providing communication in and/or through highly stressed networking environments. Stressed networking environments include those with intermittent connectivity, large and/or variable delays, and high bit error rates. To provide its services, the DTN protocols reside at the application layer of the constituent internets, forming a store-and-forward overlay network. The key capabilities of the bundling protocols include custody-based reliability, ability to cope with intermittent connectivity, ability to take advantage of scheduled and opportunistic connectivity, and late binding of names to addresses. In this presentation, we report on the addition of MACHETE models needed to support DTN, namely: the Bundle Protocol (BP) model. To illustrate the use of MACHETE with the additional DTN model, we provide an example simulation to benchmark its performance. We demonstrate the use of the DTN protocol and discuss statistics gathered concerning the total time needed to simulate numerous <b>bundle</b> <b>transmission...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the use of}} a semantically rich storage model in order to fulfill the data {{transmission}} requirements of challenged networking environments, which are characterised by long delays and frequent communication disruptions. Practical experience shows us that the highly successful data abstractions of mainstream storage systems (e. g. monolithic file representation) operate poorly in emergent networking environments such as Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs); short contact times do not allow for complete file or <b>bundle</b> <b>transmissions.</b> We have ported and integrated two systems in order to provide a solution that overcomes many of the data transmission challenges of DTNs: a semantically rich storage system (Datom) and a network framework capable of exploiting this augmented expressive power (Haggle). Our solution, Bedouin, enables both systems to run on resource-constrained devices. It facilitates meaningful data exchanges in challenged networks supporting the principle of infrastructure-independent networking, and exploiting human mobility and opportunistic connectivity. The design and function of a proof-of-concept Bedouin-based peer-topeer file sharing application for human networks, called Caravan, is included.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an incentive scheme for promoting the cooperation, and, therefore, avoiding selfish behaviours, in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) by rewarding participant nodes with cryptographic keys {{that will be}} required for sending bundles. DTN are normally sparse, and there are few opportunistic contacts, so forwarding of other’s bundles can be left out. Moreover, {{it is difficult to}} determine the responsible nodes in case of bundle loss. The mechanism proposed in this paper contributes to both problems at the same time. On one hand, cryptographic receipts are generated using time-limited Identity Based Cryptography (IBC) keys to keep track of <b>bundle</b> <b>transmissions.</b> On the other hand, these receipts are used to reward altruistic behaviour by providing newer IBC keys. Finally, these nodes need these IBC keys to send their own bundles. When all nodes behave in a cooperative way, this incentive scheme works as a virtuous circle and achieves a Nash equilibrium, improving very much the network performance in terms of latency. The scheme is not difficult to implement, and it can use an already existing IBC infrastructure used for other purposes in a DTN...|$|R

The set of experimental conditions necessary to obtain uniform nanoparticles is very restrictive, as the change in either the polyol ratio or the reactant concentrations led to ill-defined and/or aggregated particles. The morphology of the particles consists of a starlike, hierarchical structure formed by the ordered arrangement of nanorod <b>bundles.</b> <b>Transmission</b> electron tomography has revealed that the nanostars are not spherical but flattened particles. Likewise, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetry have shown that the synthesized nanostars are functionalized with citrate groups. The mechanism of formation of the nanostars has been analyzed to explain their morphological features. The as-synthesized BiPO 4 nanostars exhibit an efficient photocatalytic performance for the degradation of Rhodamine B. Finally, it has been demonstrated that the stars can be Eu 3 +-doped up to 2 mol % without any change in the particle morphology or symmetry, and the doped samples show emission in the orange-red region of the visible spectrum after ultraviolet excitation.

Our knowledge {{on the early}} interface between the infective metacyclic forms and the mammalian host skin is currently highly limited. Glossina morsitans flies infected with fluorescently tagged T. brucei parasites were {{used in this study}} to initiate natural infections in mice. Metacyclic trypanosomes were found to be highly infectious through the intradermal route in sharp contrast with blood stream form trypanosomes. Parasite emigration from the dermal inoculation site resulted in detectable parasite levels in the draining lymph nodes within 18 hours and in the peripheral blood within 42 h. A subset of parasites remained and actively proliferated in the dermis. By initiating mixed infections with differentially labeled parasites, dermal parasites were unequivocally shown to arise from the initial inoculum and not from a re-invasion from the blood circulation. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated intricate interactions of these skin-residing parasites with adipocytes in the connective tissue, entanglement by reticular fibers of the periadipocytic baskets and embedment between collagen <b>bundles.</b> Experimental <b>transmission</b> experiments combined with molecular parasite detection in blood fed flies provided evidence that dermal trypanosomes can be acquired from the inoculation site immediately after the initial transmission. High resolution thermographic imaging also revealed that intradermal parasite expansion induces elevated skin surface temperatures. Collectively, the dermis represents a delivery site of the highly infective metacyclic trypanosomes from which the host is systemically colonized and where a proliferative subpopulation remains that is physically constrained by intricate interactions with adipocytes and collagen fibrous structures.

The molecular basis of the development and maintenance of the apical and basal compartments in sensory hair cells is poorly understood. Here we describe auditory/vestibular mutants isolated from forward genetic screens in zebrafish with lesions in the adaptor protein 1 beta subunit 1 (ap 1 b 1) gene. Ap 1 b 1 is a subunit of the adaptor complex AP- 1, which has been implicated in the targeting of basolateral membrane proteins. In ap 1 b 1 mutants we observed that although the overall development of the inner ear and lateral-line organ appeared normal, the sensory epithelium showed progressive signs of degeneration. Mechanically-evoked calcium transients were reduced in mutant hair cells, indicating that mechanotransduction was also compromised. To gain insight into the cellular and molecular defects in ap 1 b 1 mutants, we examined the localization of basolateral membrane proteins in hair cells. We observed that the Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase pump (NKA) was less abundant in the basolateral membrane and was mislocalized to apical bundles in ap 1 b 1 mutant hair cells. Accordingly, intracellular Na(+) levels were increased in ap 1 b 1 mutant hair cells.

Gelation tests have shown that enantiomerically pure homochiral 1, 3, 5 -cyclohexyl-tricarboxamide-L-phenylalanine is a non-hydrogelator as it crystallizes from water, whereas the heterochiral derivatives with either two L-phenylalanine moieties and one D-phenylalanine (LLD), or vice versa (DDL), are very good hydrogelators. Concentration-dependent gel-to-sol transition-temperature (T-gs) curves for LLD or DDL gels show a siamoidal behaviour, which is in contrast to the logarithmic curves generally observed for gels derived from low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs). Such sigmoidal behaviour can be related to interactions between fibre bundles, which give rise to intertwined <b>bundles</b> of fibres. <b>Transmission</b> electron microscopy (TEM) images of LLD and DDL gels show a network of thin, unbranched, fibre bundles with diameters of 20 nm. Right-handed twisted fibre bundles are present in the LLD gel, whereas left-handed structures can be found in tile DDL gel. Each bundle of fibres consists of a finite number of primary fibres. Gels consisting of mixtures of gelators, LLD and DDL, and nongelators (LLL or DDD) were investigated by means of T-gs measurements, CID spectroscopy and TEM. Results show that the incorporation of nongelator molecules into gel fibres occurs; this leads to higher T-gs values and to changes in the helicity of the fibre bundles. Furthermore, it was found that peripheral functionalization of the homochiral derivatives LLL or DDD by means of a second amino acid or a hydrophilic moiety can overcome the effect of chirality; this process in turn leads to good hydrogelators...|$|R

The primary result of this work explores how 10 + years of simulated wear on a VIRUS fiber <b>bundle</b> affects both <b>transmission</b> and focal ratio degradation (FRD) of the optical fibers. During the accelerated lifetime tests we continuously monitored the fibers for signs of FRD. We find that transient FRD events were common during the portions of the tests when motion was at telescope slew rates, but dropped to negligible levels during rates of motion typical for science observation. Tests of fiber transmission and FRD conducted {{both before and after}} the lifetime tests reveal that while transmission values do not change over the 10 + years of simulated wear, a clear increase in FRD is seen in all 18 fibers tested. This increase in FRD is likely due to microfractures that develop over time from repeated flexure of the fiber bundle, and stands in contrast to the transient FRD events that stem from localized stress and subsequent modal diffusion of light within the fibers. There was no measurable wavelength dependence on the increase in FRD over 350 nm to 600 nm. We also report on bend radius tests conducted on individual fibers and find the 266 microns VIRUS fibers to be immune to bending-induced FRD at bend radii of R > 10 cm. Below this bend radius FRD increases slightly with decreasing radius. Lastly, we give details of a degradation seen in the fiber bundle currently deployed on the Mitchell Spectrograph (formally VIRUS-P) at McDonald Observatory. The degradation is shown to be caused by a localized shear in a select number of optical fibers that leads to an explosive form of FRD.

40|$|The {{interface}} between living nervous systems and hardware {{is an excellent}} proving ground for precision experimental methods and information classification systems. Nervous systems are complex (104 - 1015 (!) connections), fragile, and highly active in intricate, constantly evolving patterns. However, despite the conveniently electrical nature of neural transmission, the {{interface between}} nervous systems and hardware poses significant experimental difficulties. As the desire for direct interfaces with neural signals continues to expand, the need for methods of generating and measuring neural activity with high spatiotemporal precision has become increasingly critical. In this thesis, I describe advances I have made {{in the ability to}} modify, generate, measure, and understand neural signals both in- and ex-vivo. I focus on methods developed for transmitting and extracting signals in the intact nervous system of Hirudo verbana (the medicinal leech), an animal with a minimally complex nervous system (10000 neurons distributed in packets along a nerve cord) that exhibits a diverse array of behaviors. To introduce artificial activity patterns, I developed a photothermal activation system in which a highly focused laser is used to irradiate carbon microparticles in contact with target neurons. The resulting local temperature increase generates an electrical current that forces the target neuron to fire neural signals, thereby providing a unique neural input mechanism. These neural signals can potentially be used to alter behavioral choice or generate specific behavioral output, and can be used endogenously in many animal models. I also describe new tools developed to expand the application of this method. In complement to this input system, I describe a new method of analyzing neural output signals involved in long -range coordination of behaviors. Leech behavioral signals are propagated between neural packets as electrical pulses in the nerve connective, a <b>bundle</b> of neural <b>transmission</b> fibers. These signals control and coordinate sophisticated behavioral motions allowing the animal to combine several stereotypical behaviors to performs actions such as hunting. I developed a blind source separation technique to isolate individual axon activity patterns from noisy, highly overlapping local voltage measurements of the intact bundle. These axon activity patterns correspond to single neural sources. My unsupervised algorithm can extract candidate signal patterns that are undetectable by established techniques. Using a propagation-sensitive electrode I developed, I am able to acquire neural signal velocity and direction information. With this set of information, I successfully identify rhythmically active multifunctional neurons that participate in interganglionic signaling during swimming, crawling, and whole-body shortening. I also demonstrate tracking of single neural sources across distant measurement sites. These results demonstrate a new way to search for behaviorally important biological signals, and help locate and identify signals involved in specific behaviors in Hirud...|$|R
