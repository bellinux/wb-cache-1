40|$|Following {{crises and}} fiascos, a framing contest {{takes place in}} which actors have to account for their actions and might get blamed for what went wrong. An {{inadequate}} response to blame can lead to resignation or losing a re-election. Currently, the literature on <b>blame</b> <b>games</b> focuses mainly on the policy, agency, and – especially – presentational strategies one can use to respond to blame. Based on our analysis of the <b>blame</b> <b>games</b> following two festival disasters in Germany and the Netherlands, we show that our current understanding of <b>blame</b> <b>games</b> and <b>blame</b> responses needs to be broadened to include context, rituals, and sub-blame games...|$|R

40|$|Benchmarking {{has long}} been a central {{component}} of the global development industry, with the most prominent recent initiative being the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) framework. However, within existing scholarship, the agent-level interactions surrounding the MDG framework remain under-explored. Here, on the back of an analysis of interactions that took place within and around key MDG review summits, I develop a typology to clarify the intersection of benchmarking and <b>blame</b> <b>games.</b> Overall, I demonstrate that despite the efforts of the MDG architects to insulate the initiative, <b>blame</b> <b>games</b> have permeated policymakers’ engagements with the framework. Moreover, the content of these <b>blame</b> <b>games</b> have been carried over into the recently outlined Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A pattern of strategic clarification has seen the emergence within this follow-on SDG framework of more precise responsibilities on higher-income states to meet aid targets, and on lower-income states to meet governance reform targets. Given the deeply-embedded cleavages that were evident in UN review summits, similar <b>blame</b> <b>games</b> seem likely to follow the periodic evaluations within the SDGs’ lifespan...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of policy failures is, by definition, not a neutral endeavour, since policy fiascos are not neutral events. Moreover, they are often, usually implicitly, but sometimes explicitly, permeated with prosecutorial narratives, <b>blame</b> <b>games</b> and {{a search for}} culprits. Fiascos do not just ‘happen’. They are constructed, declared, and argued over in labelling processes that are not necessarily ‘evidence– based’. This presents a challenge for any academic endeavour to identify, analyse and explain policy fiascos. Against this backdrop, we assess the study of policy failure as it stands today, and offer some reflections for its further development...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{a general}} {{validity}} of the prevalent Accounting Equation in determining the real wealth and accountability discharge through contemporary financial reporting. In so doing, an augmented accounting framework is developed in order to indicate the gaps that may arise in the accounting equation; which {{is inherent in the}} system if compared among different layers – sign to alleged to referent (Buarillard 1983, 1994; MacIntosh 2000, Ijiri 1986, and Mattessich 2003).

40|$|The {{constant}} threat of crises such as disasters, riots and terrorist attacks poses a frightening challenge to Western societies and governments. While {{the causes and}} dynamics of these events have been widely studied, we know little about what happens following their containment and the restoration of stability. This volume explores 'post-crisis politics,' examining how crises give birth to longer term dynamic processes of accountability and learning which are characterised by official investigations, <b>blame</b> <b>games,</b> political manoeuvring, media scrutiny and crisis exploitation. Drawing {{from a wide range}} of contemporary crises, including Hurricane Katrina, 9 / 11, the Madrid train bombings, the Walkerton water contamination, Space Shuttles Challenger and Columbia and the Boxing Day Asian tsunami, this is a ground-breaking volume which addresses the longer term impact of crisis-induced politics. Competing pressures for stability and change mean that policies, institutions and leaders may occasionally be uprooted, but often survive largely intact...|$|R

50|$|Following {{these initial}} recordings, <b>Blame</b> <b>Game</b> played small tours and local shows between 2001-2002. Between {{this time the}} band began to draw a larger {{influence}} from avant-garde performers and bands, such as Captain Beefheart and U.S. Maple, {{as well as from}} free jazz performers like Peter Brotzman, Ornette Coleman and Albert Ayler, shifting the band's sound from hardcore punk, to a more wiry, spastic and “improv” oriented sound. In 2002, the band performed on the WREK radio show Live at WREK, playing 12 songs (many of which displayed their newer style) and followed it with a second set which was entirely improvised. In January 2003, the band self-released the <b>Blame</b> <b>Game</b> Trio cd-r, which was recorded by Alex Lambert, and contained entirely improvised material. Later that same year, the band recorded 8 songs at The Living Room Studio (formerly Red Lab Studios) in Atlanta, Ga with recording engineer Ed Rawls. These 8 songs where released on the b-side of a split LP (released by Adagio 830/660 Productions in Europe and Crab Apocalypse in the U.S.) with the German band Zann. <b>Blame</b> <b>Game</b> toured Europe for 3 weeks and the U.S. for 2½ weeks with Zann to support this release.|$|E
5000|$|When United States Secretary of Education Arne Duncan {{issued a}} {{statement}} siding with a California superior court judge who ruled the state's teacher tenure protections unconstitutional, Weingarten responded that Duncan had [...] "added to the polarization" [...] in debates over education policy, and charged that focusing on [...] "quick fixes, <b>blame</b> <b>games</b> or silver bullets" [...] such as ending tenure had [...] "set us back in our effort to help all kids succeed." [...] The AFT has worked, however, to reshape tenure in some states. In 2011 Weingarten offered {{a plan that would}} rely on a teacher-evaluation system with multiple parts—including assessment of student improvement on tests—to give tenured teachers rated unsatisfactory one year to improve, and allow the firing of teachers who fail to meet that deadline within the next 100 days. The proposal followed a 2008 agreement between Weingarten and District of Columbia public schools chancellor Michelle Rhee that allowed the termination of Washington Teachers' Union members evaluated as ineffective, after a one-year period—and in public remarks, Weingarten has discussed her role in efforts to modernize tenure elsewhere.|$|R

30|$|The ACF model {{provides}} social implications {{about how}} to induce significant policy reform through constructing common values and beliefs. More specifically, this case suggests that policy knowledge and information about pension reform proposals can play {{a key role in}} preventing stakeholder groups from leaving the line of the pension reform. A detailed roadmap for specific policy alternatives and pension reform proposals was specifically reported in the media, creating an atmosphere for social consensus (Radaelli, 1995). Specific information or policy knowledge on institutional reforms from relevant stakeholders has put pressure on social consensus. In particular, if information and knowledge on specific pension reform proposals were not provided to the public through policy experts with diverse stances from online mass media, resistance from public employee unions’ pension reform would be strong. The presentation of alternatives to the pension reform proposals from the Korean Pension Association as well as policy experts involved in the ruling party and the opposition party prompted national consensus on the necessity and necessity of reforming the public employee pension system. Specific and clear information may prevent seeking to <b>blame</b> <b>games</b> for competing solutions to massive institutional reforms (Weaver, 2010).|$|R

40|$|Viewed comparatively, the {{achievements}} and failings of the Howard government {{look a little}} different, write Rodney Tiffen and Ross Gittins in Inside Story HOW MUCH difference did the Howard government make to Australian society? In the heat and hyperbole of political controversy it’s often difficult to get perspective on a government’s achievements and failures – particularly because the political credit and <b>blame</b> <b>games</b> tend to focus wholly on domestic and party-political factors. A comparative and historical perspective can give greater context to the claims and counter-claims. Here we compare Australia’s performance against seventeen other advanced democracies including the United States, Canada, Japan and the countries of Western Europe. Central to the political credentials of the Howard government was its claim {{to have been a}} successful economic manager – a view to which the figures give some, but not unqualified, support. Figure 1 shows that Australia’s per capita economic growth rate moved very broadly in alignment with the average of the eighteen countries. But until after the Hawke government, Australia had a growth rate rather less than the average; then, under Keating and Howard, it grew more quickly than the average. The highest rates of growth were between 1992 and 2000 – four years under Labor, four under the Coalition – with all countries having a somewhat lower growth rate between 2001 and 2006 [...] .
