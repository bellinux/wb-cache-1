50|$|A <b>Barbed</b> <b>broach</b> is an {{instrument}} used to remove pulp tissue during endodontic (root canal) treatment. It is manufactured from round wires, and the smooth surface is notched to form barbs. There are smooth broaches too available, which act as pathfinders into the root canal.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} substance P (SP) and {{the effect}} of ketoprofen administration, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), on SP in the pulp of upper third molars with experimentally induced pulpal lesion. Materials and Methods. A sample of 20 young systemically healthy adults of both sexes, nonsmokers, with a healthy upper third molar to extract for orthodontic purposes, was selected. Prior to the procedure, an inflammatory process was generated by mechanical exposure of the pulp. After 15 minutes, the pulp was collected using a sterile <b>barbed</b> <b>broach.</b> SP levels were determined by using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) kit. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: group 1 received a dose of ketoprofen 30 minutes prior to the experimental procedure. The subjects of group 2 did not receive any kind of drug administration. The patients were asked to complete a diary on the postoperative pain. Results. No statistically significant difference could be detected in SP expression between the two groups. In group 1, pain manifestation was significantly delayed in comparison with group 2. Conclusions. Preventive administration of ketoprofen did not significantly affect the pulpal levels of SP but resulted in a significantly postponed manifestation of pain after extraction...|$|E
40|$|The risk of {{infections in}} dental {{practices}} has been attracting for decades {{the interest of}} researchers {{from all over the}} world. A serious problem related to the transmission of blood-borne viruses is the thorough removal of organic matter, and mainly blood, from dental instruments when performing manual pre-sterilization decontamination. Application of benzidine test to prove the presence of blood traces on large and small dental instruments prepared for sterilization for the purpose of assessing the quality of the manual pre-sterilization decontamination. A total of 485 benzidine tests had been performed on selected 205 large and 280 small dental instruments visibly contaminated with blood. Of the total of 485 tested samples, blood traces were found in 63 (12. 99 ± 1. 53 %). In the group of large instruments, positive benzidine test was obtained in 7. 80 % compared to 16. 78 % in the small instruments with the difference being statistically significant (p = 0. 003). All 63 positive samples were additionally processed using ultrasound. Blood traces were found in 8 instruments with all of the positive samples being obtained from the <b>barbed</b> <b>broaches.</b> The manual cleaning does not guarantee decontamination of the dental instruments unlike the ultrasonic cleaning where any blood traces are being completely removed from the large instruments. In terms of the small instruments, there are still blood traces present after the ultrasonic cleaning which requires for it to be combined with a suitable enzyme cleaner, and the <b>barbed</b> <b>broaches,</b> as a requirement, should be used on a disposable basis...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} practice of yesterday′s endodontics becomes the heresy of today, and today′s endodontic practice becomes the heresy of tomorrow. The history of endodontics {{begins in the}} 17 th century. Since then, {{there have been numerous}} advances and developments, and research has proceeded continuously without pause. The manufacture of the first instruments for endodontic use dates back to 1875. These early instruments were made by hand from thin steel wires, and they performed the function of modern <b>barbed</b> <b>broaches.</b> In 1955, Ingle was the first to express the need for standardization of canal instruments. In 1965, the American Association of Endodontists adopted the terminology and nomenclature of the proposed standardized system. For many years, the standard cutting instruments have been the reamer, the K-type file, and the Hedstroem file. Recent changes in both metallurgy and endodontic concepts have led to the introduction {{of a wide range of}} new instruments. An effort has been made here to present the journey of endodontic instruments from the past to the present...|$|R
40|$|Ingestion of {{instruments}} {{is a potential}} complication that can occur during dental procedures. We report a case of accidental ingestion of an endodontic <b>barbed</b> wire <b>broach</b> during root canal treatment and its subsequent retrieval by endoscopic methods. Although prevention is the best approach, proper management of such an event is also crucial. The objective of this report is {{to draw attention to}} the potentially serious complications that can occur if preventive techniques are not practised, and to discuss the accepted guidelines for management of such an event...|$|R
