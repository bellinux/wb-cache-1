40|$|The massive {{growth in}} English {{as a medium}} of {{instruction}} (EMI) in non-English-dominant universities {{in recent years is}} undisputed. However, it raises questions about the quality and standard of such programmes for all kinds of students: domestic, international, outgoing, incoming and returning. This workshop focuses on the language-related aspects of English-medium programmes, addressing questions about language/content learning, English language proficiency, entry and exit level English-language requirements, pre- and in-session English-language training. The workshop is divided into two parts. The first provides an overview of the what, where and why of English as a medium of instruction. In terms of the what, it seeks to clarify and define ‘EMI’, distinguishing it from other terms with which it is often confused. In terms of where, it provides an overview of the extent of EMI according to country, discipline and tier; and in terms of why, it discusses the reasons for the dramatic rise in EMI programmes. The second part of the workshop will be tailor-made to the audience and address specific questions and concerns about language-related issues of EMI. This part of the workshop depends on attendees emailing questions prior to the event. Please send your questions and a little <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> yourself and <b>your</b> job role to kristina. hultgren@open. ac. uk at the latest one week before the workshop, I. e. 14 November 2016...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{identity}} of the teacher-researcher in an early childhood classroom is complex, weighed down with social and cultural perceptions regarding academic research and the education of young children. Certain levels of education, such as a bachelor’s or master’s degree, are considered ‘appropriate ’ and are valued in early childhood educators. However, the degree of doctorate is not considered ‘appropriate ’ for a teacher of early childhood, {{and the desire to}} remain in the classroom while holding this degree is often met with surprise and disapproval. What does this mean in terms of our attitudes toward early education? Do some students warrant a teacher with a doctorate while others do not? This narrative inquiry examines one ‘over-educated ’ teacher’s experience of situating herself within the preschool classroom as both teacher and researcher, both insider and outsider. Triumph and Guilt: the interview I sit in the cool of the school office clutching the phone and trying to act nonchalant. While pacing. And sweating profusely. And praying that the kids don’t come crashing in, saying something inappropriate.

40|$|RITCHIE: I've {{been doing}} these {{interviews}} in a biographical, chronological framework, beginning with people's backgrounds, their family life, where they grew up, the schools they went to, {{and what they}} did before they came to the Senate. I wondered if you could tell me a little <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> parents, who they were {{and what they did}}? VALEO: Yes, my father came as an immigrant {{around the turn of the}} century, at the age of sixteen. He worked as a shoemaker, or shoe repairer, and then in a shoe factory; eventually became a foreman of the factory. My mother was born on Hester Street, on the Lower East Side, also of immigrants who had arrived a few years earlier. Her family grew up in Brooklyn. They moved there at a rather early date because there was a large shoe factory there called Wickett and Gardens. Her father, something of an entrepreneur, had opened a series of small businesses, starting with a barbershop, and then a bar, and a grocery store, things of that sort. She went to work at the age of nine in the factory. She had only three years of schooling. My father had perhaps five. Both recognized the value of education and were insistent that I get it. So that's where it began...|$|E
40|$|Dr. Richard Goode, a Baylor alumnus {{who has had}} a {{distinguished}} career as an economist at the International Monetary Fund, the Brookings Institution, the U. S. Treasury Department, the University of Chicago, Johns Hopkins and other places. We are at Dr. Goode’s home at 5420 Connecticut Avenue, N. W., in Washington, D. C. The date today is March 6, 1998, and the time is about 1 : 30 p. m. Dr. Goode, I {{want to thank you very}} much for joining me today, or letting me join you here at your home today. This is an honor for me to meet with you and to have this time to talk. RICHARD B. GOODE: My pleasure. GARDNER: Well, I know that you were born in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1916. Why don’t we begin by talking a little <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> family background. What did your grandparents and your parents do in the Fort Worth area? 2 GOODE: Well, one of my grandfathers was a Baptist preacher. The other grandfather was an active Baptist layman. It so happens that my birthday and their birthdays were all on July thirty-first; an unusual coincidence. So I’m named after both of them: Richard and Benjamin. I don’t use the middle name much, but that’s my middle name. When I was born, my father was a small farmer. He had a varied career. Later, he was a carpenter and small contractor, and we always lived around in that area. My father was born in East Texas; my mother was born in Georgia. And that’s the family history. I was the only one of my immediate family—I had two older sisters—to attend college. Neither my parents nor my older sisters did. GARDNER: Your grandfather who was a preacher, was he a pastor of a church? GOODE: I think he was at various times, but not when I remember him. He was—well, he was essentially retired when I remembered him. My great-grandfather, by the way, was born in the eighteenth century. GARDNER: Is that right? GOODE: In 1786. GARDNER: Was that also in Texas...|$|E
