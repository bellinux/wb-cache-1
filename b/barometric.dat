5|$|In 1927, {{there were}} 27tropical {{cyclones}} {{observed in the}} western Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the 180th meridian. Many of these storms affected the Philippines, China, and Japan, collectively leaving 15,952fatalities. The strongest storm of the year also had the lowest <b>barometric</b> pressure recorded in a tropical cyclone worldwide at the time. On August18, the Dutch steamship Sapoeroea recorded a <b>barometric</b> pressure of 886.7millibar (26.185inches of mercury) about 740kilometres (460miles) east of Luzon. This typhoon later struck near Hong Kong, where it halted transportation, wrecked buildings, and killed 15people.|$|E

5|$|The {{most intense}} {{hurricane}} (by <b>barometric</b> pressure) on record {{to form in}} the North Atlantic basin was Hurricane Wilma (2005) (882 mbar).|$|E
5|$|At a <b>barometric</b> {{pressure}} of 218 atmospheres, the critical point {{of water is}} 375°C. At a depth of 3,000meters, the <b>barometric</b> {{pressure of}} sea water is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407°C (see image). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Rita is {{the fourth}} strongest Atlantic {{hurricane}} in terms of <b>barometric</b> pressure and one of three tropical cyclones from 2005 on the list, with the others being Wilma and Katrina at first and sixth, respectively. However, with a <b>barometric</b> pressure of 895mbar (hPa; 26.43inHg), Rita is the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes Camille, Mitch, and Dean share intensities for the seventh strongest Atlantic hurricane at 905mbar (hPa; 26.73inHg). The tenth place for most intense Atlantic tropical cyclone is Hurricane Maria listed to have deepened to a pressure as low as 908mbar (hPa; 26.81inHg).|$|E
5|$|Pulpitis (inflammation of the pulp) can be {{triggered}} by various stimuli (insults), including mechanical, thermal, chemical, and bacterial irritants, or rarely <b>barometric</b> changes and ionizing radiation. Common causes include tooth decay, dental trauma (such as a crack or fracture), or a filling with an imperfect seal.|$|E
5|$|September 16, 1858 — Low <b>barometric</b> {{pressure}} of 28.87 inches mercury at Sag Harbor is reported, and {{is thought to}} be associated with a tropical cyclone which causes no known damage.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Gwenda {{was tied}} with Cyclone Inigo for the most intense Australian {{tropical}} cyclone on record, with a <b>barometric</b> pressure of 900hPa (mbar) and was the most intense storm worldwide in 1999. Forming out of a tropical disturbance over the Arafura Sea on 2April 1999, the precursor to Gwenda tracked slowly westward and gradually became more organised. On 4April, the system developed into a Category 1 cyclone and was named Gwenda. It began to undergo explosive intensification the following day, and in a 30-hour span ending early on 7April, the storm's maximum 10-minute sustained wind speed increased from 75km/h (45mph) to 225km/h (140mph) and its <b>barometric</b> pressure decreased to 900hPa (mbar). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported that the storm had peaked as a high-end Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 India cyclone was {{the second}} strongest {{tropical}} cyclone, in terms of <b>barometric</b> pressure, to form in the Arabian Sea on record; only Cyclone Gonu in 2007 was stronger. The storm originated from a tropical disturbance that formed east of Somalia on May18. Over the following few days, the system gradually organized into a tropical depression. Tracking eastward, towards the coastline of southwestern India, the storm slowly intensified. Shortly before reaching shore, the system turned north and later west, away from land. After taking this turn, the storm intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm, attaining its peak intensity on May24 with winds of 215km/h (135mph 3-minute winds) and a <b>barometric</b> pressure of 932mbar (hPa). At the time, this ranked the cyclone as the strongest known storm in the Arabian Sea.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Fourteen was {{the last}} {{tropical}} depression of the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season and was the third most destructive storm of the year. The depression formed on October 31, 1987 in the Caribbean Sea, heading along a northward path into the southern Gulf of Mexico and into Florida until the system was absorbed on November 4. The path and damage from the depression followed a similar path to Hurricane Floyd earlier in October. The depression peaked in intensity with wind speeds of 35mph (55km/h) on November 1 with a minimal <b>barometric</b> pressure reading of 1004millibars (29.65 inHg). However, certain <b>barometric</b> readings have considered that the depression may have become a tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due to the high <b>barometric</b> pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures.|$|E
5|$|By noon on Sunday, weather {{conditions}} on lower Lake Huron {{were close to}} normal for a November gale. <b>Barometric</b> pressures in some areas began to rise, bringing hope of {{an end to the}} storm. The low pressure area that had moved across Lake Superior was moving northeast, away from the lakes.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, 21 {{tropical}} cyclones {{were observed}} in the western Pacific Ocean, north of the equator. In that region of the world, cyclones that attain maximum sustained winds of at least 118 km/h (74 mph) are known as typhoons. Out of the 21 storms, the Hong Kong Observatory tracked nine of them. The strongest storm, known as the De Witte typhoon, reached a minimum <b>barometric</b> pressure of , before striking eastern China.|$|E
5|$|Myers had {{mechanical}} {{understanding and}} improved many devices. One was a patented invention of a kerosene lamp damper that reduced considerably the flame's smoke. Another innovation, {{of which he}} was proud, was an automatic self-recording mercury barometer that memorialized its measurements on a paper strip; with this meteorological instrument he kept a continuous <b>barometric</b> record that covered a span of 30 years.|$|E
5|$|On July15, the {{hurricane}} moved ashore near Matagorda Bay in Texas, with winds estimated around 105mph (165km/h), or a Category2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. At landfall, the minimum <b>barometric</b> pressure {{was estimated at}} 969mbar (28.61inHg). The hurricane's strong winds broke all of the boats from their moorings in the Matagorda harbor. Four ships were either lost or wrecked, and one schooner was washed ashore. The storm dissipated early on July16 after progressing further inland.|$|E
5|$|On May 14, a {{tropical}} cyclone was observed {{just east of}} Samar, {{an island in the}} east-central Philippines. Estimated to have reached typhoon intensity, the storm moved westward through the Visayas archipelago, producing a <b>barometric</b> pressure of 971mbar (28.68inHg) aboard a ship. The storm curved northeastward in the South China Sea, striking Taiwan on May 20. The storm proceeded through the Ryukyu Islands and was last noted on May 23.|$|E
5|$|Once an all-human {{endeavor}} based mainly upon {{changes in}} <b>barometric</b> pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, forecast models are now {{used to determine}} future conditions. On the other hand, human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involve many disciplines such as pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Fern reached hurricane {{status as}} it neared the Texas coastline. The hurricane reached a peak intensity of 90mph (140km/h) and its <b>barometric</b> pressure dropped to 979 millibars. An incoming mid-latitude trough caused Fern to stall east of Texas for twelve hours. After the trough moved by, Fern turned southwest, paralleling the Texas coastline before making landfall on September 10 between Freeport and Matagorda.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{began as}} a tropical wave—a westbound low-pressure area—first observed southeast of Cape Verde on 29August. Traversing the tropical Atlantic, the wave retained a minimum <b>barometric</b> pressure of about 1010mbar (hPa; 29.83inHg) and strengthened briefly the following day. By 1September, however, the wave had become rather weak and indiscernible; it would remain as such for much of its early existence until 6September, by which time it had moved past the Windward Islands. In this region the system became sufficiently organised to be classified as a tropical depression at 18:00UTC that same day near Grenada. Some six hours after its inception the depression strengthened to a tropical storm over the eastern Caribbean Sea. Owing {{to a lack of}} ship observations, data on the storm were scarce in that region. The first ship to identify the storm clearly was the tanker Geo H. Jones, which recorded strong winds in conjunction with rapidly decreasing <b>barometric</b> pressures late on 7 September. As the storm remained west-northwest bound across the Caribbean, more ships were able to record data on the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Upon being named, Cosme meandered and {{remained}} nearly stationary as {{it continued to}} intensify. It became a hurricane midday UTC on June 21; this upgrade was delayed in real time. At this time, the hurricane accelerated towards the north. As the cyclone approached the coast of Mexico, it reached maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum <b>barometric</b> pressure of 979 millibars.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{landfall}} near Tampico, {{a station}} in the city recorded a minimum <b>barometric</b> pressure of 1,004mbar (hPa; 29.65inHg), the lowest pressure measured {{in association with the}} storm. Due to a lack of available weather ships in the region because of World War II, no ships documented the tropical cyclone. In Texas, the tropical cyclone caused light rainfall, damaging local cotton crops. Strong wind gusts were observed in the Rio Grande Valley.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} {{was located}} in the central Gulf of Mexico on September 9, potentially the same hurricane as the previous storm. It tracked generally eastward toward the coast of Florida, with its hurricane intensity estimation based on two ship reports. At about 0000UTC on September 12, it moved ashore near Clearwater, Florida as a minimal hurricane, with an estimated minimum <b>barometric</b> central pressure of 985mbar. Accelerating east-northeastward while crossing the state, the cyclone emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as a weakened tropical storm before regaining hurricane status on September 13. Later that day, it was last observed about 250mi (400km) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras.|$|E
5|$|A {{research}} paper published {{ten years after}} the storm suggested that Gay could have been stronger than Typhoon Tip, which attained the lowest <b>barometric</b> pressure ever recorded. While at its peak intensity, Gay registered a rating of 8.0 for nine consecutive hours using the Dvorak technique, indicating sustained wind speeds of at least (315km/h) 195mph. In addition, the cyclone had a significantly colder band of clouds around the eye. Typhoon Angela in 1995 presented similar features and could have been stronger than Gay. Neither of the two had direct observations into their eyes, however, making it impossible to confirm such intensity.|$|E
5|$|A timer {{ensured that}} the bomb would not explode until at least fifteen seconds after release, one-quarter of the {{predicted}} fall time, to ensure safety of the aircraft. The timer was activated when the electrical pull-out plugs connecting it to the airplane pulled loose as the bomb fell, switching it to internal (24V battery) power and starting the timer. At {{the end of the}} 15 seconds, the radar altimeters were powered up and responsibility was passed to the <b>barometric</b> stage.|$|E
5|$|Alex was {{the first}} Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{in the month of}} June since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the strongest in terms of wind speed since Hurricane Alma in 1966. Its <b>barometric</b> pressure recording of 946 mbar (27.96inches) is the most intense from any Atlantic hurricane in June, although Hurricane Audrey in 1957 ties this intensity. Alex is thus tied for the most intense June Atlantic hurricane on record overall. However, as Audrey's pressure was estimated, Audrey's actual pressure might be as low as 925 mbar.|$|E
5|$|Although {{extrapolated}} {{peak maximum}} sustained winds based on whatever reports are available exist for every storm in 1860, estimated minimum central <b>barometric</b> air pressure listings are only {{present for the}} three storms that made landfall in the United States. As the three landfalling storms moved inland, information on their meteorological dissipation was limited. As a result, the intensity of these storms after landfall and until dissipation {{is based on an}} inland decay model developed in 1995 to predict the deterioration of inland hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{extrapolated}} peak winds {{based on}} whatever reports are available exist for every storm in 1861, estimated minimum <b>barometric</b> air pressure listings are only {{present for the}} three storms that directly affected the United States. Two hurricanes during the year made landfall on the mainland United States, and as they progressed inland, information on their meteorological demise was limited. As a result, the intensity of these storms after landfall and until dissipation {{is based on an}} inland decay model developed in 1995 to predict the deterioration of inland hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Amy neared {{hurricane}} intensity several times, {{beginning on}} June30 as maximum winds increased to 70mph (110km/h); however, {{the storm was}} unable to acquire enough tropical features, and remained predominately subtropical. Gale-force winds at this time extended roughly 125mi (210km) out from the center {{to the north and}} east. Despite being subtropical at this point, the NHC decided against renaming it due to Amy's proximity to land. On July2, a <b>barometric</b> pressure of 981mbar (hPa; 28.97inHg) was recorded, the lowest in relation to Amy. The following day, another trough caused the storm to accelerate northeastward. On July4, Amy passed roughly 170mi (270km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland before becoming an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Around 1200UTC the {{following}} day, Linfa further intensified into a severe tropical storm. A microwave satellite {{image of the}} storm depicted an eye-feature surrounded by deep convection. Interacting with a nearby upper-level low, poleward outflow significantly improved late on June19, fueling further strengthening. Slowly tracking in a general northward direction, Linfa continued to organize and by June20, the JTWC upgraded Linfa to a typhoon. A small, ragged eye appeared on visible satellite images by this time and several hours later, the storm reached its peak intensity just below typhoon-status according to the JMA. Maximum sustained winds peaked at 110km/h (70mph 10-minute winds) and a <b>barometric</b> pressure of 975hPa (mbar).|$|E
5|$|By 1200UTC on February14, Nancy {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity with winds of 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds) and a <b>barometric</b> pressure of 935hPa (mbar). Shortly after, the JTWC assessed Nancy to have peaked with winds of 230km/h (145mph 1-minute winds). Increasing forward motion {{to the southeast}} and increasing wind shear caused Nancy to weaken. Early on February15, the storm passed directly over Manuae. Continued weakening took place as a trough approached from the southwest. By February16, Nancy weakened below hurricane intensity {{and turned to the}} southwest as it began to undergo a Fujiwhara interaction with Cyclone Olaf to the north.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of August20, Bret was {{designated}} a hurricane following reports of 75mph (120km/h) winds during a Hurricane Hunter mission. At around the same time, Bret established a north-northwest track under the influences of a mid-level ridge. The following day, Bret began to undergo rapid intensification, as a well-defined eye developed. On the morning of August22, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 145mph (230km/h) and a <b>barometric</b> pressure of 944mbar (hPa; 27.88inHg). Shortly thereafter, an upper-level trough {{to the west of}} the storm began to erode its cloud pattern.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Monica {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity on 23 April near Cape Wessel with a <b>barometric</b> pressure 916mbar (hPa; 27.05inHg). Maximum winds were estimated at 250km/h (155mph 10-minute sustained) by the Bureau of Meteorology while the JTWC assessed {{it to have}} attained winds of 285km/h (180mph 1-minute sustained). Using the Dvorak technique, the peak intensity of the cyclone was estimated at T-number of 7.5 according to the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), yet the Advanced Dvorak Technique of the CIMSS automatically estimated at T8.0, the highest ranking on the Dvorak Scale. However, since the JTWC, SAB and CIMSS are not the official warning centres for Australian cyclones, these intensities remain unofficial.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Nancy (RSMC Nadi designation:09F, JTWC designation:18P) was {{the second}} {{in a series of}} four severe {{tropical}} cyclones to impact the Cook Islands during February 2005. Forming out of an area of low pressure on February10, Nancy quickly organized into a small, but intense, cyclone. By February14, the storm explosively intensified into a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone with winds peaking at 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds) and a minimum <b>barometric</b> pressure of 935hPa (mbar). Over the following day, increasing wind shear rapidly weakened the cyclone and by February17, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly before being absorbed by Cyclone Olaf.|$|E
5|$|Dan {{crossed over}} the island and emerged into the South China Sea, having lost its eye feature and {{weakened}} back into a tropical storm. Convection soon redeveloped as the storm moved northwestward through warm waters. The JTWC reports that Dan reattained typhoon status at 0000 UTC on October 12, although it according to the JMA it did so 24 hours earlier. The typhoon continued to intensify, and the JTWC estimates that it reached its peak intensity at 0600 UTC, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 130km/h (80mph). The JMA indicates that Dan peaked slightly afterward, with 10-minute sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and a minimum <b>barometric</b> pressure reading of 960 millibars.|$|E
5|$|Despite forming {{fairly close}} to the Lesser Antilles, no {{tropical}} cyclone warnings were issued for the islands, as the official forecast correctly foresaw that Philippe would stay well to the east. A tropical storm warning was issued for Bermuda on September 23, but proved redundant when Philippe dissipated well {{to the south of}} the island. The storm still brought gusty winds and moisture to the island, with 0.15inches (3.8mm) of precipitation reported on September 23. The circulation that absorbed Philippe dropped light rainfall on the island, and was responsible for the lowest <b>barometric</b> pressure during the month.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{relatively}} unfavorable vertical {{wind shear}} impacting Colin, deep thunderstorm activity developed atop its center of circulation. Data from a reconnaissance aircraft {{during the afternoon}} hours of August5 revealed that the system reached a peak intensity with winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum <b>barometric</b> pressure of 1005mbar (29.68inHg). A few computer models, namely the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model (HWRF), predicted that Colin would briefly attain hurricane status.|$|E
