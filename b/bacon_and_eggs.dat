5|$|After the First World War, {{many new}} food {{products}} became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Kitchen servants with time to make custards and puddings were replaced with instant foods in jars, or powders that the housewife could quickly mix. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and <b>bacon</b> <b>and</b> <b>eggs</b> of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choice, the 1920s saw many new kinds of fruit imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene, aided by refrigerators and refrigerated ships.|$|E

500|$|While Christmas in Poland is {{traditionally}} linked to red borscht, Lent – the fasting period that leads up to Easter – {{is associated with}} a meatless version of white borscht, or [...] Youths used to celebrate Holy Saturday, {{the last day of the}} fast, with a mock [...] "funeral" [...] of the white borscht, in which a pot of the soup was either buried in the ground or broken, sometimes – to the crowd's amusement – while being carried by an unsuspecting boy on his head.

500|$|In the 19th century, Denmark's main food export was grain to the UK, {{but it was}} outcompeted by the United States and Russia {{and began}} to switch to pigs and butter from dairy herds. [...] From 1840 to 1870 grain was almost half of Denmark's exports, but by 1900 this had fallen to under 3 per cent. [...] Denmark {{exported}} bacon to the United Kingdom from at least 1847, when flitches of bacon were specially prepared for the English market, but had no large-scale production until 1864, when the Second Schleswig War made export of live pigs to Hamburg, where up to then they had been slaughtered and cured, impossible and Denmark was forced to do this locally. [...] However, export to the UK only became significant after Germany, to whom Denmark had been exporting since the Middle Ages, erected trade barriers to (1879), and finally banned (1887), the import of live pigs. [...] The lost German market amounted to almost 300,000 pigs per year and Denmark desperately needed {{to find a new}} market. [...] The Danish imports were welcomed in the UK; the growth in population following the Industrial Revolution meant that the country was no longer self-sufficient in food, but there was an increasing demand from a more affluent working class. [...] At the time, British workers on average pay consumed bacon two to three times a week, and <b>bacon</b> <b>and</b> <b>eggs</b> became the traditional British breakfast. [...] This had previously been quite unaffordable for the working class. [...] By the end of the 19th century, 90% of Danish pig exports went to the UK and accounted for 20% of total Danish exports. [...] This made Denmark the main supplier to the UK, replacing the U.S. which previously held that position. [...] Danish Bacon still had more than 25% of the UK market in the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|One {{particularly}} notorious {{example of}} this first came to public attention in the mid-1990s, when the Center for Science in the Public Interest produced a report about [...] "Movie Popcorn", which {{became the subject of}} a widespread publicity campaign. The movie theaters surveyed used coconut oil to pop the corn, and then topped it with butter or margarine. [...] "A medium-size buttered popcorn", the report said, [...] "contains more fat than a breakfast of <b>bacon</b> <b>and</b> <b>eggs,</b> a Big Mac and fries, and a steak dinner combined." [...] The practice continues today. For example, according to DietFacts.com, a small popcorn from Regal Cinema Group (the largest theater chain in the United States) still contains 29 g of saturated fat. the equivalent of a full day-and-a-half's reference daily intake.|$|E

[...] Disney and the Army knew this and wanted to depict the Germans living in a land that was hollow of all the wonderful promises that Hitler made.

2500|$|Members of the Met's {{roster of}} artists, {{including}} Caruso, had visited San Francisco in April 1906 {{for a series}} of performances. Following an appearance as Don Jose in Carmen at the city's Grand Opera House, a strong jolt awakened Caruso at 5:13 {{on the morning of the}} 18th in his suite at the Palace Hotel. He found himself in the middle of the San Francisco earthquake, which led to a series of fires that destroyed most of the city. The Met lost all the sets, costumes and musical instruments that it had brought on tour but none of the artists was harmed. Holding an autographed photo of President Theodore Roosevelt, Caruso ran from the hotel, but was composed enough to walk to the St. Francis Hotel for breakfast. [...] Charlie Olson, the broiler cook, made the tenor <b>bacon</b> <b>and</b> <b>eggs.</b> [...] Apparently the quake had no effect on Caruso's appetite, as he cleaned his plate and tipped Olson $2.50. Caruso made an ultimately successful effort to flee the city, first by boat and then by train. He vowed never to return to San Francisco and kept his word.|$|E
2500|$|At The Wigwam, Chief Flying Hawk {{could have}} rest and relaxation. Show touring {{schedules}} were grueling, each spring through fall, with performances twice daily. Traveling, pony riding, war dances and inclement weather weighed on Chief Flying Hawk’s health. [...] Here he could rise with {{the morning sun}} {{for a walk in}} the forest, enjoy a breakfast of <b>bacon</b> <b>and</b> <b>eggs,</b> with fruit and coffee, smoke his redstone pipe and have a glass of sherry before retiring. Chief Flying Hawk preferred to sleep on the enclosed sun porch at The Wigwam with his robes and blankets and could not be induced to sleep on a white man’s mattress and springs. He refused to be sent to a bedroom, and asked to have the buffalo robes and blankets. With them he made his couch on the open veranda floor, where he retired in the moonlight. McCreight was impressed with Chief Flying Hawk’s grace and dignity: [...] "The Chief was engaged in taking down his long hair-plaits in which were woven strips of otter fur. From his kit sack he took his comb and bottle of bear’s oil and carefully combed and oiled his hair, made up new plaits, then applied a little paint to his cheeks, looked into a small hand-mirror, and was ready to answer questions. His hair, now still reaching to his waist, was streaked with grey. In reply to how Indians were able to retain their hair in such perfect condition, he said they did always retain it, sometimes they got scalped, but they prided themselves in caring for their bodies. He said that long ago Indians often had hair that reached the ground." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Wigwam was Chief Flying Hawk’s {{second home}} for nearly thirty years. Traveling with Wild West shows, pony riding, war dances and inclement weather weighed on Chief Flying Hawk’s health.

[...] Here he could rise with {{the morning sun}} {{for a walk in}} the forest, enjoy a breakfast of <b>bacon</b> <b>and</b> <b>eggs,</b> with fruit and coffee, smoke his redstone pipe and have a glass of sherry before retiring. Chief Flying Hawk, “refused to be sent to a bedroom, and asked to have the buffalo robes and blankets. [...] With them he made his couch on the open veranda floor, where he retired in the moonlight.” McCreight was impressed with Chief Flying Hawk’s grace and dignity, and described Chief Flying Hawk’s meticulous grooming. “The Chief was engaged in taking down his long hair-plaits in which were woven strips of otter fur. [...] From his kit sack he took his comb and bottle of bear’s oil and carefully combed and oiled his hair, made up new plaits, then applied a little paint to his cheeks, looked into a small hand-mirror, and was ready to answer questions.

He said that long ago Indians often had hair that reached the ground.” [...] However, even in the relaxed atmosphere of The Wigwam, there was a formality to the visits. Of importance, Flying Hawk was an Oglala Lakota Chief and it was his duty to display his beautiful eagle feather “Chief’s Wand” during visits to The Wigwam. [...] “At sun-up the Chief was missing. [...] Breakfast was delayed. Presently, Chief Flying Hawk was seen coming from the forest which nearly surrounds The Wigwam. In his hand he carried a green switch six feet in length. [...] From his traveling bag he took a bundle which he carefully unfolded and laid out, a beautiful eagle feather streamer which he attached to the pole at either end. [...] After testing it in the breeze he handed it to McCreight with gentle admonishment to keep it in a place where it could always been seen. [...] It was the Chief’s “wand,” and he said it must always be kept where it could be seen, else people would not know who was Chief. [...] Having disposed of this, to him, important duty, the Chief was ready for breakfast.” ...|$|E
