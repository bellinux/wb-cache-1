25|$|The local coal {{industry}} {{was at the}} forefront of the sudden dramatic decline of the British coal mining industry, which was precipitated by a change of government economic policy in the early 1980s. This had very severe knock-on effects in the many reliant local industries, and caused much local hardship. The 1985 miners' strike was sparked by the impending closure of Cortonwood Colliery in Brampton Bierlow, a neighbouring village often considered a part of Wath. Along with the whole of the Dearne Valley, Wath was classified as an impoverished area and received much public money, including European funds. These were put into regenerating the area from the mid-nineties onward causing a certain amount of economic revival, and changing the character of the area to be more rural as large areas of ex-industrial land to the north of the town which were once collieries and railway marshalling yards were turned back into scrubland and countryside, dotted with light industrial and commercial office parks. This regeneration has now progressed such that the reclaimed countryside, as it still classified as <b>brownfield</b> <b>land,</b> has been built over with various industrial and commercial parks, and large housing developments have also been started.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficient}} territorial management {{represents a}} necessity of topical interest, both at regional and at local level.

The physical-geographical characteristics and the economic peculiarities of the Maramureş –Chioar region have generated the existence of some land categories that can represent an outlet in rapport with the space crisis. It refers to the <b>brownfield</b> <b>lands,</b> whose functional reintegration within the territory must represent a constant preoccupation for the local and regional authorities. The possible alternatives for reintegration have in view the re-valorization of the respective lands, both through their ecologization and through associating some necessary and desirable territorial functions. At local level, {{the adoption of a}} development direction based on compact spatial patterns and on the preferable and priority use of <b>brownfield</b> <b>lands</b> is necessary...|$|R

500|$|As {{early as}} 1989, city {{officials}} in Allentown had {{announced plans to}} revitalize <b>brownfield</b> <b>land</b> along the Lehigh River, which included the abandoned Arbogast & Bastian plant. [...] This redevelopment, {{which was to be}} known as [...] "Lehigh Landing," [...] was originally to include a museum, a brewery, walking trails, a footbridge across the river, and a promenade for festivals. [...] Allentown businessman Raymond E. Holland, former president of Holiday Hair Fashions, had purchased the abandoned Arbogast & Bastian plant for $250,000 in 1985 and gave it to the Allentown Economic Development Corp. as a charitable contribution in 1990. [...] Development of [...] "Lehigh Landing" [...] was hindered by fundraising problems, environmental remediation issues, and even a national debate on pork barrel government spending. [...] The iconic Arbogast & Bastian plant remained vacant for over a decade, often the victim of vandalism and suspicious fires. [...] The plant was finally dismantled in late 1990s, and the company's large heart-shaped sign, long a fixture of the Allentown skyline, was taken down on June 30, 1998. The offices of Arbogast & Bastian, which had not been torn down, were later incorporated into the America On Wheels museum, which was opened {{on the site of the}} former Arbogast & Bastian plant in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|The Barking Riverside {{development}} {{is part of}} the London Riverside project, which aims to regenerate the Thames riverside area of East London through new homes, jobs, and services. Barking Riverside consists of [...] of <b>brownfield</b> <b>land</b> and therefore needs site clearance and the removal of overhead power lines before it can go ahead. Construction began in 2008, with completion due around 2025. 10,000 homes are to be built, housing around 25,000 people. New transport links will be provided, including East London Transit and the extension of the Docklands Light Railway at Barking Riverside DLR station, and City Hall is seeking £150 million to extend the Gospel Oak to Barking Line of the London Overground from Barking railway station to Barking Riverside. Barking and Dagenham Council has said that it does not believe the 10,800-home brownfield development to be viable without improved transport connections, and expects that the Treasury is likely to confirm funding in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Autumn 2013 statement, due to be made on 4 December 2013. The development will also provide new public facilities, creating [...] "a variety of living, working, leisure and cultural amenities". Two new primary schools and one secondary school will be built, and the public will have access to two kilometres of Thames river front. The Rivergate Centre, designed by van Heyningen and Haward Architects, provides the civic facilities for the initial phase of Barking Riverside, while a new square and 3FE primary school, which includes embedded community facilities, a nursery, church, flexible office suites for the PCT and Community Development Trust, as well as a MUGA and sports pitches are also planned. As yet unbuilt, the second phase provides 90 flats, local shops and a neighbourhood police post.|$|E

In January 2010, however, the council deleted references to the redevelopment of the site. Simon Danzcuk, the Rochdale Labour Party parliamentary candidate, has warned that the council believe a housing development on the site is an inevitability and that they are [...] "sleepwalking into a catastrophic mistake." [...] MMC have stated that [...] "there is no viable alternative to development led remediation of the site." [...] A National Health and Safety Commissioner who was formerly a Health and Safety Manager at the factory has said that the felling of trees and disturbing of soil on the site is [...] "sheer madness... With the potential amount of asbestos on that site, no development should be built on this land." [...] Hilda Palmer of the Greater Manchester Hazards Centre has said: [...] "Asbestos is a carcinogen and it causes lung diseases.
