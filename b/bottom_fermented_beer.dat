By 1923 output had increased to 3,325 hectolitres of beer per year and the original brewery buildings had become too small. Thus, in 1924 Johannes built a new brewhouse where the new <b>bottom</b> <b>fermented</b> <b>beer</b> was brewed. At that time rarely used [...] "Brewing" [...] enabled him to produce lighter [...] "Pilsener type" [...] beer with distinctive fresh taste. Hereby he found the worldwide expansion of the brewery and established worldwide known brand - Bavaria Brewery (Netherlands). Johannes has turned the business over to his sons Jan, Frans and Piet in 1925 but {{until his death in}} 1950 he still oversaw the operation of the family business.|$|E

50|$|Yeasts that ferment at warmer temperatures, usually between , form a {{layer of}} foam {{on the surface of}} the <b>fermenting</b> <b>beer,</b> which is why they are {{referred}} to as top-fermenting yeasts. Yeasts that ferment at considerably lower temperatures, around , have the ability to process a chemical compound known as raffinose, a complex sugar created during fermentation. These yeasts collect at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>fermenting</b> <b>beer</b> and are therefore referred to as bottom-fermenting yeast. The majority of beer in production today is fermented in this way and is called lager.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore the hedonic response of consumers to cheese and beer pairings by tasting in a typical social environment of consumption. Ninety-six regular beer and cheese consumers hedonically rated all fifty-six pairings of eight <b>bottom</b> <b>fermented</b> red <b>beers</b> and seven cheeses (Parmigiano Reggiano, Fontina, Taleggio, Smoked Provola, Mozzarella, Caprino, and Gorgonzola). Preference varied across samples (p. <. 0. 001). One consumer out of two appreciated all of the pairings, yet pairings with Mozzarella were liked moderately. One consumer out of three appreciated pairings with Parmigiano, were neutral in their hedonic response to pairings with Fontina and disliked moderately the remaining pairings but those including mozzarella were extremely unappealing to them. One consumer out of six disliked all the pairings tested but some matches with Parmigiano were liked slightly. Liking of cheese and <b>bottom</b> <b>fermented</b> red <b>beer</b> pairings is biased by the type of cheese partnered with beer (Parmigiano most liked and Mozzarella least liked); by the type of beer partnered with cheese, and by the liking of the sensory properties of the beers and of the cheese tasted alone. However, consumers do not simply enjoy a combination of their most preferred beer and cheese. They identified some flavors that harmonize better than do others. Also, significant correlations between mean liking scores and sensory characteristics of the fifty-six pairings were found. Beer flavor is modified largely by prior cheese consumption. Each cheese has an effect on beer flavor and this effect is consistent over the eight different beers. In general all of the cheeses decreased the intensity of fruitiness, sweetness, perceived level of carbonation, perceived level of alcoholicity, caramel-like, licorice-like and burnt notes. Bitterness, astringency, and burnt notes were reduced by most of the cheeses but Fontina and Smoked Provola increased the perception of these attributes. For brewers to profitably exploit the potential of the science of cheese and beer pairing the choice of a suitable beer and of a suitable cheese in terms of liking and sensory properties and the identification of a proper target audience familiar to the beers paired with cheese are essential...|$|R

5000|$|Dortmund {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} commercial brewing centres in Germany, establishing itself as a major brewing city which exported its beers to the neighbouring Westphalian cities. The Dortmunder breweries originally brewed a wheat based, dark coloured, short <b>fermented</b> <b>beer.</b> However, in 1873, when the golden coloured, pale barley based, slow <b>fermented</b> <b>beer</b> as brewed in Pilsen and known as Pilsener, became popular, several of the local breweries grouped together under the name Dortmunder Union to produce their own pale lager under the guidance of the brewmaster Fritz Brinkhoff.

40|$|The {{patterns}} of consumers' preferences for <b>bottom</b> <b>fermented</b> red <b>beers</b> (BFRBs) {{available on the}} Italian market were explored. 246 regular beer consumers hedonically rated eight BFRBs of different styles readily available in the off-premise chain of the Italianmarket on a 9 -point hedonic scale in a natural environment of consumption. A trained panel (n = 8) evaluated 34 sensory properties of the eight beers. The relations between consumers' hedonic scores and the sensory characteristics of the BFRBs were investigated with PLS-Regression. Statistically significant differences (p b 0. 05) among the eight BFRBs were found for the 34 sensory properties evaluated in this study. Principal Component Analysis of the mean descriptive data showed that BFRBs were primarily distinguished {{on the basis of}} malt derived sensory attributes, and secondarily {{on the basis of their}} perceived level of body along a sweetness gradient that separated medium bodied, moderately sweet BFRBs from full bodied samples moderately high to high in sweetness. Consumers' hedonic responses to BFRBswere extremely heterogeneous across samples (p b 0. 001). The source of the variability appeared to be a specialty BFRB, which contains added red fruits. It was highly appreciated and significantly preferred over other BFRBs, which were moderately liked and not distinguishable from each other. PLS-Regression clustered the consumers in homogeneous groups according to their liking of the beers and the sensory characteristics of those beers. Nearly 4 consumers out of 10 (Sweet Seekers) highly appreciated sweet and fruity samples, which were perceived as having a high level of alcohol. Nearly one consumer out of five (Mild Flavor Lovers) tended to prefer samples brewed from less intensively kilned/roasted malts. Those beers carry mild flavors and are perceived as having a lower level of alcohol. One consumer out of seven (Sweet Avoiders) equally liked all the BFRBs served to them but beer A. This beer was perceived as too bodied and rich in alcohol, and too intense fruity, and sweet, with solvent-like notes. One consumer out of seven (Flavor Seekers) disliked less alcoholic BFRBs. Those BRFBs, brewed frommoderately kilned/roasted malts, have amilder flavor and less intense mouthfeel perceptions. Gender and age were not significant predictors of preference, althoughmale consumers weremore frequent beer drinkers, exhibited more variable beer choice, sought flavor more and avoided flavor less than did female beer drinkers. The findings of this study should help brewers and restaurateurs understand consumer preference patterns for BFRBs and enable them to engineer optimal strategies to target specific segments of the beer market...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} research {{carried out in}} the last few decades, continuous beer fermentation has not yet managed to outperform the traditional batch technology. An industrial breakthrough in favour of continuous brewing using immobilized yeast could be expected only on achievement of the following process characteristics: simple design, low investment costs, flexible operation, effective process control and good product quality. The application of cheap carrier materials of by-product origin could significantly lower the investment costs of continuous fermentation systems. This work deals with a complete continuous beer fermentation system consisting of a main fermentation reactor (gas-lift) and a maturation reactor (packedbed) containing yeast immobilized on spent grains and corncobs, respectively. The suitability of cheap carrier materials for long-term continuous brewing was proved. It was found that by fine tuning of process parameters (residence time, aeration) it was possible to adjust the flavour profile of the final product. Consumers considered the continuously <b>fermented</b> <b>beer</b> to be of a regular quality.

40|$|The {{consumption}} {{and production of}} top <b>fermenting</b> <b>beers</b> in South America and Brazil have great increased in the past years. Despite the great biodiversity and production of traditional alcoholic beverages, all Brazilian craft brewers still depend on imported commercial yeast strains {{as a result of}} total lack of information and studies about the use of indigenous strains in brewing. Hence, the costs of buying yeast are high and even more with the greater tendency to produce various beer styles and application of many different strains. From this perspective,this study aimed to selected indigenous South American yeasts able to produce high quality and flavorful top <b>fermented</b> <b>beers.</b> Ninety nine Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild strains, from different regions in South America(from North to South of Brazil, Ecuador and Galapagos Island) all from a variety of niches like environment strains (mainly tree barks) and from different musts of traditional spontaneous beverages with spontaneous fermentation (cachaça, traditional fruit wines, chicha etc.) were tested. Based on the maltose fermentation, 20 S. cerevisiae strains from the 99 tested were characterized with its different killer activity and selected to perform top <b>fermented</b> <b>beers</b> in different scales. Preliminary tests were performed on lab scale where it was evaluated the main fermentation parameters (attenuation degree, alcohol production etc.), fermenting sugars (HPLC) and the main aroma compounds (HS-SPME) produced by each different yeast. Based on these results, 12 strains were selected to perform brewing process on pilot scale. The same parameters described were analyzed, together with sensory analysis. Based on physiological aspects, fermentative capacity and production of desirable flavor compounds and final product, were selected yeasts with great potential and one indigenous strain was selected to be tested on an industrial scale, whereas all described parameters were also followed. In cooperation between Universities and Industry, the first beer with indigenous Brazilian yeast was produced in the facilities of a micro-brewery (Grimor Brewery, Brazil) and was released in the market. In addition to the results with high reproducibility as regards of the fermentation parameters and aroma compounds produced, the beer also was very approved by Brazilian consumers. This work showed {{for the first time the}} use of Brazilian S. cerevisiae strain as starter in the production of flavorfull top <b>fermenting</b> <b>beer</b> with no prior need for adaptations and attending industrial proportions. This may support and commence the building of an innovative beer yeast bank, which so far does not exist in Brazil and undoubtedly provides a basis for diversified beer brewing. This work encourages the greater autonomy to the sector in increasing expanding in the country, with knowledgeable brewing of cost-effective and flavor-rich new craft beers. The attractive results show undoubtedly a support to Brazilian sector and other yeast dependent countries that can point out the unique and high-valued biodiversity in brewing. status: publishe...|$|R
