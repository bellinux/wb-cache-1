40|$|Nanosecond laser flash {{photolysis}} (LFP) is an indispensable technique for photoinduced kinetic studies either by transient absorption or time-resolved emission measurements. Despite {{the commercialization of}} the instruments {{that can be used}} for conducting this type of measurements, many researcher still prefer to assemble their own LFP apparatuses in order to adjust them to the nature of their work and allow optimization and expandability. In this article we described in detail the nanosecond LFP apparatus that has been assembled and used in our laboratory. Significant limitations on this technique are imposed by its sensitivity and the time range that it can cover. These issues have been addressed by a design of a detector assembly that takes advantage of a fast head-on photo-multiplier tube, which is powered through an active <b>bleeder</b> <b>circuit</b> designed after detector circuitry used in high-energy physics experiments. In addition, a high-precision compensating circuit is employed to remove the DC component of the signal. High sensitivity and a working time range from tens of nanoseconds to tens of seconds (or longer) were achieved without compromising the speed of the detection required for nanosecond transient absorption. The described detector and the whole LFP apparatus have considerably simpler control interface in comparison to other instruments of this type. The work of the apparatus is illustrated with examples of transient absorption and time-resolved emission data for solutions of ethyl eosin and terbium (III) dipicolinate complex, respectively...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the improvements {{made in the}} detection system of the pulse radiolysis facility based on a 7 MeV Linear Electron Accelerator (LINAC) located in the Radiation Chemistry and Chemical Dynamics Division of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. The facility was created in 1986 for kinetic studies of transient species whose absorption lies between 200 and 700 nm. The newly developed detection circuits consist of a silicon (Si) photodiode (PD) detector for the wavelength range 450 - 1100 nm and a germanium (Ge) photodiode detector for the wavelength range 900 - 1600 nm. With these photodiode-based detection set-up, kinetic experiments are now routinely {{carried out in the}} wavelength range 450 - 1600 nm. The performance of these circuits has been tested using standard chemical systems. The rise time {{has been found to be}} 150 ns. The photo-multiplier tube (PMT) <b>bleeder</b> <b>circuit</b> has been modified. A new DC back-off circuit has been built and installed in order to avoid droop at longer time scales. A steady baseline upto 10 s with PMT and upto 100 s with PD is available without any droop. The RF interference generated during the delivery of the electron beam pulse by the LINAC normally limits the measurements below 20 mV signal. The introduction of a fibre optic cable between the LINAC cave and the data acquisition laboratory has enabled us to analyse even weak signals of the order of 5 mV...|$|E
50|$|Because of the speed/power tradeoff, high-powered {{circuits}} may use {{two separate}} <b>bleeder</b> <b>circuits.</b> A fast bleed circuit is switched out during normal operation {{so that no}} power is wasted; when power is switched off, the fast bleeder is connected, rapidly bleeding down the voltage. The switch controlling the fast bleeder can fail, either by connecting when it shouldn't (and overheating) or by not connecting when it should (and thereby failing to bleed off the voltage quickly). To avoid the risk of not having an operational bleeder, a secondary, slower (and less lossy) bleeder is usually permanently connected {{so that there is}} always some bleed-down capability.|$|R
40|$|The TEA 1721 is a {{small and}} low cost module Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) {{controller}} IC for low power applications (up to 5 W) and operates directly from the rectified universal mains input. The device includes a high voltage power switch (700 V) and has been optimized for flyback converter topologies to provide high-efficiency over the entire load range with ultra-low power consumption in the no-load condition. It provides a circuit for start-up directly from the rectified mains voltage without any external <b>bleeder</b> <b>circuits.</b> The converter operates as a regulated voltage source from no-load up to the maximum output current and operates as current source that delivers the maximum current over a broad output voltage range. Using the TEA 1721, a low power converter can be built at minimum cost and with the minimum number of external components. The controller regulates the output voltage with primary-side sensing which {{eliminates the need for}} an additional secondary feedback circuitry and simplifies the design. At higher power levels, a frequency and current control mode is used. It operates with Burst mode control at low power levels and no-load condition. The burst mode minimizes audible noise and provides an energy saver state which reduces the power consumption in no-load condition. The Burst mode frequency of 1270 Hz enables no-load power consumption below < 22 mW at high mains input. 1. 2 Features and benefits Power features: Low power SMPS controller with integrated power switch designed for applications up to 5 W 700 V high voltage power switch for global mains operation Primary sensing for control of the output voltage without optocoupler and secondary feedback circuitry Minimizes audible noise in all operation modes USB battery charging and Energy Star 2. 0 compliant Jitter function for reduced EMI applications, 1270 Hz burst frequenc...|$|R
