40|$|Assessing species {{vulnerability}} to environmental changes {{is a major}} challenge for conservation. Combinations of <b>biological</b> <b>attributes</b> have already been successfully used for this purpose, allowing large-scale prediction of inter-specific differences in demographic parameters (e. g. abundance) or endangered status. However, studies investigating whether <b>biological</b> <b>attributes</b> {{could be used to}} predict the temporal demographic responses of species in a changing environment are still scarce. In this work, we tackled this issue by taking advantage of a multi-decadal survey of concomitant changes in fish communities and environmental conditions within the Terminos lagoon (Mexico). Based on this rare dataset, we first characterized changes in abiotic parameters that occurred in this ecosystem since the 80 s. Then, we adapted a multivariate index accounting for changes in both species abundance and occurrence to assess concomitant demographic changes for the 25 dominant fish species in the lagoon, classifying them into five various types of trajectories ("Increasing", "Decreasing", "Constant", "Hump-shape" and "U-shape"). Finally, we assessed the accuracy in prediction of these temporal responses for all possible combinations of 15 <b>biological</b> <b>attributes</b> including taxonomy, ecological and life-history traits. Our results showed that fish specific demographic changes over the last 30 years could be accurately predicted (72 % accuracy) using a combination of five <b>biological</b> <b>attributes</b> (spawning season, order, maximum salinity, width of salinity range, oocyte size) among which three could be related to the increase in average salinity occurred in the lagoon over this period.

Transformation approaches avoid the major obstacle to performing genetics experiments in trees – namely long generation cycles {{and the difficulty of}} inbreeding to reveal loss of function alleles. Dominant transgenic alleles allow modifications in gene function to be readily observed in primary transformants. Although transformation has been mainly used for reverse genetics (where the gene sequence of interest is known), transgenic mutagenesis approaches such as acti-vation tagging and gene/enhancer traps have also been shown to enable forward genetics (where the phenotype, not the gene, is known). We outline challenges and needs for more efficient use of transformation tools. These include expansion of the transformation toolbox (e. g., promoters, vectors, targeting), and improved ability to conduct field trials to study gene function in native and plantation environments (in spite of regulatory obstacles). Because of the power of transformation, it will remain a major genetic research tool for dissection of gene function in Populus for many years to come.

Soil samples were collected from the 0 – 0. 20 m layer, before and after leveling, on a 100 point grid established in the experimental area, to evaluate chemical attributes and soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC). Leveling operations altered the magnitude of soil chemical and <b>biological</b> <b>attributes.</b> Values of Ca, Mg, S, cation exchange capacity, Mn, P, Zn, and soil organic matter (SOM) decreased in the soil profile, whereas Al, K, and MBC increased after leveling.

30|$|Feminist {{researchers}} {{were the one}} who put the idea of unconscious gender issues under the spotlight of the core social science research. They critically analyzed gender as a moral order, rather than <b>biological</b> <b>attribute,</b> developed it into a basic analysis concept similar to class and ethnicity, and widely used gender in theoretical and empirical research (Worthman 1995). In-depth analysis of gender issues treats gender as a social structure that parallels economic and political structures—gender structure. This enabled analysis of gender’s embeddedness at the individual, interpersonal, and systematic level and its differentiation process as well as its impact on people’s attitudes and behaviors (Risman 2004). It follows that, within the structure of family, gender structure can also affect gender ideology and behaviors of family members. The gender of children as part of the family gender structure has also been shown to affect different aspects of family processes (e.g., parental investment, ideology and behavior of reproduction, marital status, mental health, etc.) (Raley and Bianchi 2006). In sum, we believe that the gender of children can affect the parental perception and identity about gender roles and division. In other words, we can make such a theoretical proposition: children can affect the gender ideology of their parents.|$|E

Here, we assessed the possibility of identifying a common diagnostic biomarker for CUP using a microarray gene expression analysis. METHODS: Tumor mRNA samples from 60 patients with CUP were analyzed using the Affymetrix U 133 A Plus 2. 0 GeneChip and were normalized by asinh (hyperbolic arc sine) transformation to construct a mean gene-expression profile specific to CUP. A gene-expression profile specific to non-CUP group was constructed using publicly available raw microarray datasets. The t-tests were performed to compare the CUP with non-CUP groups and the top 59 CUP specific genes with the highest fold change were selected (p-value< 0. 001). RESULTS: Among the 44 genes that were up-regulated in the CUP group, 6 genes for ribosomal proteins were identified.

In spite of this context of multiple stressors, physical effects are often solely considered in the ecological assessment of the dam impacts. 2. We studied four reservoir/downstream reach systems differing in levels of sediment contamination in reservoirs. Using assemblages and biotrait (i. e. ecological or <b>biological</b> <b>attribute)</b> responses of macroinvertebrate communities and leaf litter breakdown, we examined the individual effects and potential interactions between sediment contamination and dam presence along the gradient of ecotoxic pressure. 3. Leaf breakdown rates ranged from 0. 0044 degrees per day in the most contaminated reservoir to 0. 0120 degrees per day in the reference reservoir. Comparisons of community trait profiles among reservoirs highlighted a gradient of trait responses to sediment contamination. 4. In the absence of toxic contamination, the dam-induced modifications in biotraits of invertebrate assemblages were not related to a reduction of leaf litter breakdown. Conversely, contaminated sediment in reservoir induced strong functional disturbances (i. e. bioecological shifts and reduction of leaf litter breakdown) downstream of dams. 5. Key biotrait categories positively related to leaf litter breakdown rate have been identified. They corresponded mainly to shredders and/or small-sized (4 cm) species, having several generations per year (polyvoltin), using asexual reproduction and/or disseminating by drift (aquatic, passive). 6.

40|$|Abstract Background Clearly visualized biopathways {{provide a}} great help in {{understanding}} biological systems. However, manual drawing of large-scale biopathways is time consuming. We proposed a grid layout algorithm that can handle gene-regulatory networks and signal transduction pathways by considering edge-edge crossing, node-edge crossing, distance measure between nodes, and subcellular localization information from Gene Ontology. Consequently, the layout algorithm succeeded in drastically reducing these crossings in the apoptosis model. However, for larger-scale networks, we encountered three problems: (i) the initial layout is often very far from any local optimum because nodes are initially placed at random, (ii) from a biological viewpoint, human layouts still exceed automatic layouts in understanding because except subcellular localization, it does not fully utilize biological information of pathways, and (iii) it employs a local search strategy in which the neighborhood is obtained by moving one node at each step, and automatic layouts suggest that simultaneous movements of multiple nodes are necessary for better layouts, while such extension may face worsening the time complexity. Results We propose a new grid layout algorithm. To address problem (i), we devised a new force-directed algorithm whose output is suitable as the initial layout. For (ii), we considered that an appropriate alignment of nodes having the same <b>biological</b> <b>attribute</b> {{is one of the}} most important factors of the comprehension, and we defined a new score function that gives an advantage to such configurations. For solving problem (iii), we developed a search strategy that considers swapping nodes as well as moving a node, while keeping the order of the time complexity. Though a naïve implementation increases by one order, the time complexity, we solved this difficulty by devising a method that caches differences between scores of a layout and its possible updates. Conclusion Layouts of the new grid layout algorithm are compared with that of the previous algorithm and human layout in an endothelial cell model, three times as large as the apoptosis model. The total cost of the result from the new grid layout algorithm is similar to that of the human layout. In addition, its convergence time is drastically reduced (40 % reduction). </p...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Fisheries {{economics}} is a recognized {{body of research}} which {{is characterized by the}} joint study of economics, the biological characteristics of fishery resources, and the policies (regulations) used in the management of fisheries. This thesis is composed of three papers, each of which is primarily associated with one of the three areas just mentioned. The three papers form a unified whole by their concern with {{the manner in which the}} salmon species of the northeast Pacific ocean, and specifically, the salmon in and about the Columbia River, are reared, harvested, and publicly managed. The first paper (Chapter II) examines certain theoretical issues associated with the open access characteristics of most fisheries. The primary conclusion of the paper is that standard policy tools proffered by economists to solve the inefficiency associated with open access, will not likely succeed. Property rights are then shown to be a unique means to structure incentives for resource use, including the discovery of efficient uses for resources. Chapter III examines a <b>biological</b> <b>attribute</b> associated with the production of salmon, namely, the relationship between the number of hatchery fish released into the ocean, and the subsequent number of harvestable adults. This aspect has become an important issue with the emergence of large private salmon aquacultural facilities, an entrepreneurial act anticipated in Chapter II, and examined in some detail in Chapter IV. The study attempts to determine if the number of adults actually has been reduced by increasing releases of hatchery fish. A non-standard regression technique(Law of the Minimum) is employed to estimate the functional form of the relationship between hatchery releases, ocean conditions, and harvestable adults. Finally, Chapter IV is a critical review of economists' concern with the policy implications of their research. It is demonstrated that economists can not define the optimal use of resources, nor specify policies which will lead to the optimal use of resources. It is further argued that the economics profession is now itself an important component of the factors which affect resource usage in the open access case. Thus, economists themselves need to be studied when the purpose of the research is to understand how resources with weakly defined property rights (open access) are employed...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{approaches}} {{are introduced to}} study the structure of marine soft-bottom communities. Results of these approaches, based on the feeding type, microhabitat preference, motility pattern and body size of benthic polychaetes, were compared to one based on taxonomy (families). The material came from grab samples collected from the continental shelf and upper slope off {{the east coast of}} Canada, in depths of 85 to 622 m (x̅ = 247 m). Various multivariate analyses are used to identify recurrent biological patterns in macrofaunal assemblages. These patterns are then correlated with environmental variables via canonical analysis. No distinct faunal associations are identified from the various approaches. Instead, there was a gradual shift from one type of faunal grouping to another. [...] The value of each approach in characterizing community structure is evaluated in part by the amount of variation explained by the relationship between the biological and environmental data, and by the statistical significance of this relationship as determined by Monte Carlo tests. The recognition of homogenous groupings of samples based on faunal composition and environmental conditions, however, tends to weigh more heavily in this evaluation. With one exception, all functional and taxonomic approaches show statistically significant patterns. The approach based on feeding microhabitat indicates that this <b>biological</b> <b>attribute</b> of marine benthic polychaetes may not {{play an important role in}} the structuring of their communities. The functional approach that comprises all functional attributes (i. e. foraging attributes and body size) provides the most meaningful ecological characterization of community structure. In this functional approach, groups of samples along the faunal gradients are strongly associated with large-scale topographic features of the Labrador continental shelf and upper slope. Although the taxonomic approach yields similar results, it does not appear to be as efficient in distinguishing between sample points in multivariate analyses. In functional approaches, interpretation of the results in terms of community structure is greatly facilitated by the direct use of ecological attributes such as foraging mode and body size. [...] About half the variation in the biological data can be explained by variables such as water depth, current regime, sediment grain size and benthic biomasses which are associated with two major environmental gradients extracted by Redundancy Analysis. The effect of other biotic and abiotic factors on benthic community structure is discussed. The remaining variability in the biological data unaccounted for in this study may be explained by these factors, other unidentified processes and noise. The spatial scales at which the biological and environmental data are collected may also influence the outcome of a multivariate analysis and its interpretation...|$|E

We studied the effects of colmation on the invertebrate assemblages of three rivers, testing a priori hypotheses on the <b>biological</b> <b>attributes</b> that should be more selected in communities subjected to different levels of colmation in both zones. Only the proportion of organisms with high fecundity increased and the proportion of small-sized organisms decreased along the colmation gradient in both zones simultaneously. As expected, a higher number of traits were significantly modified with colmation in the benthic vs. hyporheic assemblages. Most of the <b>biological</b> <b>attributes</b> impaired were different in the two zones. In the benthic zone, colmation mainly selected particular physiological or trophic characteristics of species and features related to their resistance or resilience capacities. In contrast, the morphological attributes of species were much more impaired by colmation in the hyporheic zone than in the benthic zone. In clogged benthic habitats, traits seemed to be more impaired by an increase in physico-chemical constraints (e. g. the reduction of oxygen availability) and a reduction of potential exchanges (including exchanges of food resources) due to a decline in stream bed conductivity. The morphological attributes of the hyporheic species were probably more influenced by changes in interstitial space characteristics. A potential indicator of the effects of colmation on river health may be based on the functional traits of benthic communities because they (i) satisfy the WFD recommendations, (ii) respond consistently along a colmation gradient and (iii) are comparable among assemblages even across ecoregions that differ in their taxonomic composition.

40|$|Although {{experiencing}} strong anthropogenic {{pressures in}} many estuaries, {{the ecology of}} tidal freshwater areas remains largely undocumented. As part of a restoration project in the freshwater zone of the Schelde estuary (Belgium), a new tidal habitat restoration technique (Controlled Reduced Tide system, CRT) was hypothesised to successfully compensate for the impairment of contemporary habitats. The suitability of this newly-created habitat (CRT) and the estuary was investigated {{over a period of}} three years for its macroinvertebrate community development. In both the estuary and the CRT, habitats along a flooding gradient were monitored. Differences between the CRT and reference sites in community functioning were explored according to environmental characteristics and organism <b>biological</b> <b>attributes</b> using the RLQ ordination analysis together with the fourth-corner method. Frequently flooded reference sites exhibited environmental characteristics resulting from a hydrological shear stress. In the CRT, after a rapid removal of the terrestrial fauna at low and mid elevations, the low-energy hydrology led to taxonomic and functional enrichment. The RLQ analysis produced significant environmental filtering of <b>biological</b> <b>attributes</b> mainly related to the terrestrial aquatic transition and to the environmental stressors. This provides an example of life history modification via estuarine ecosystem management...|$|R
