40|$|Abstractâ€”During 5 {{successive}} {{days the}} TWA airborne concentration of mercury vapour (Hg-air) and {{the levels of}} mercury in blood (Hg-B) and in urine (Hg-U) were investigated in 10 workers in a dry alkaline battery plant. The individual external exposure measured with personal sampler ranged from 10 to 106 / i g H g m " 3 (overall mean 40 jig m~ 3). On an individual basis, strong correlations {{were found between the}} daily intensity of exposure to mercury vapour and the levels of Hg-B (end of workshift) (r = 0. 86; n = 40) or Hg-U (following morning) (r = 0. 81; n = 34). These relationships indicate that the ratio Hg-air (jjg m~ 3) :Hg-B (jigdl" 1 whole blood) :Hg-U (/Jgg" 1 creatinine) is 1 : 0. 045 : 1. 22. In view of our previous investigations on the nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity of long-term exposure to mercury vapour showing a <b>biological</b> <b>TLV</b> for Hg-U of 50 jig g " ' creatinine, this ratio suggests that the corresponding threshold values for Hg-B and Hg-air amount to 1. 8 /ig Hg d l " ' of whole blood and 40 /ig m~ 3 of air, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to {{nitrous oxide}} in {{surgical}} theaters was evaluated for duration, numbers, {{and types of}} surgical procedures. The concentration of the gas in the air was 92 - 444 ppm. Before and after the surgical sessions, samples of urine and expired air were collected from surgical theater personnel for gas determination. Nitrous oxide concentrations in urine and in expired air showed a good correlation with gas concentration in the air (r = 0. 760 and r = 0. 921, respectively). Moreover, a good correlation (r = 0. 823) between gas concentration in urine and that in expired air was also found. A {{biological threshold limit value}} (TLV) of 20. 6 micrograms/liter for urine and of 29. 6 ppm for expired air was calculated, based on the limit of 50 ppm in the air proposed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Other <b>biological</b> <b>TLVs</b> corresponding to higher proposed limits (200 and 500 ppm) were also calculated...|$|R
