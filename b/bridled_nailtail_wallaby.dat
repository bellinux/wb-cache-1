40|$|Many mammals {{have been}} {{reported}} to significantly bias their offspring sex ratios, but these deviations from equality have been difficult to understand and are often inconsistent even within the same species. Evolutionary theory predicts a number of scenarios where females should bias their investment to one sex over the other; when fitness returns are sex specific, selection favors the facultative adjustment of offspring sex ratios to the sex with the highest inclusive fitness return. Interpreting sex allocation in mammals within the framework of classic sex allocation theory is challenging given the complex life histories and social interactions of species, hence it is likely that there are multiple mechanisms and selective forces dependent upon maternal and environmental drivers. Here, we show the previously demonstrated condition-dependent sex allocation in <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallabies</b> (Onychogalea fraenata), where females in better condition {{were more likely to have}} sons, was reversed under high population densities and elevated maternal stress. In this solitary species, an elevated glucocorticoid stress response under unnaturally high densities likely influences adaptive sex allocation to the dispersive sex, consistent with the local resource competition theory. Managing factors such as population density, maternal stress, and food resources may be used to adjust offspring sex ratios in this endangered species...|$|R
5000|$|The park {{contains}} the only naturally occurring population of Australia's most endangered macropod; the <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby.</b> [...] The wallaby is now restricted {{to less than}} 1% of its former distribution, which originally extended from the Murray River near the New South Wales border, up to Charters Towers in northern Queensland. [...] Causes for the original population decline are complex, but are generally thought to have arisen {{from a combination of}} interacting factors including predation and drought. [...] The wallaby population impacts from these processes have been further exacerbated by habitat fragmentation and degradation caused by wide-scale vegetation clearance, and increased competition for food resources with domestic animals, particularly sheep.|$|E
5000|$|Cracking clay {{soils and}} brigalow {{vegetation}} species are {{dominant in the}} northern region of the park, while texture-contrast soils in combination with Eucalypt communities dominate the western region.

[...] The regions climate is described as subtropical and semi-arid; with a mean annual rainfall of 711 mm, half of which is confined to the summer months - December to February. [...] The distribution of rainfall over such a condensed period leaves the area prone to droughts; with a sustained drought event occurring, on average, once a decade.

[...] All of these external populations were originally sourced from Taunton National Park, with the aim of increasing the range extent and total number of populations, {{to reduce the risk of}} any chance event causing extinction. [...] In spite of these contingencies, the wild population at Taunton National Park is still considered the most important for the continued survival of the species as it has the highest levels of genetic diversity, and is therefore an important source for supplementing gene pools of the translocated populations.|$|E
40|$|Despite numerous, {{generally}} unsuccessful {{attempts to}} reintroduce threatened Australian mammals, the factors leading to their failure {{have not been}} fully clarified, although predator control {{would appear to be}} of paramount importance. An experimental approach was taken in attempting to establish a population of <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallabies</b> ih an area of apparently suitable habitat and low fox density, but {{on the edge of the}} species 2 ̆ 7 former range. The 133 wallabies released since late 1996 comprised four groups captive-bred animals, wild caught from the single remaining wild population, animals that were captive bred and acclimatised at the translocation site in a 10 ha predator-proof enclosure, and animals which had been bred in the enclosure. Survival was highest in those bred in the enclosure and highly variable among captive-bred animals. Survival estimates for wild recruits suggested the population would maintain a positive rate of increase under prevailing environmental conditions. Spotlighting surveys suggested the population had increased to approximately 400 animals by late 1999. Above average rainfall during 1996 - 1999 and no apparent predation suggests caution in describing the translocation as a success. Ongoing monitoring is critical, because it A uncertain ho v the population will cope with drought and inevitable predation events, and whether the population will expand and persist outside of limited preferred habitat.

5|$|In Australia, 2012 {{estimates}} {{indicate that}} there are more than 7.2million red foxes with a range extending throughout most of the continental mainland. The species became established in Australia through successive introductions by settlers in 1830s in the British colonies of Van Diemen's Land (as early as 1833) and the Port Phillip District of New South Wales (as early as 1845) for the purpose of the traditional English sport of fox hunting. A permanent fox population was not established on the island of Tasmania and it is widely held that they were outcompeted by the Tasmanian devil. On the mainland, however, the species was successful as an apex predator. It is generally less common in areas where the dingo is more prevalent, however it has, primarily through its burrowing behaviour, achieved niche differentiation with both the feral dog and the feral cat. As such it {{has become one of the}} continent's most invasive species. The red fox has been implicated in the extinction and decline of several native Australian species, particularly those of the family Potoroidae including the desert rat-kangaroo. The spread of red foxes across the southern part of the continent has coincided with the spread of rabbits in Australia and corresponds with declines in the distribution of several medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals, including brush-tailed bettongs, burrowing bettongs, rufous bettongs, bilbys, numbats, <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallabys</b> and quokkas. Most of these species are now limited to areas (such as islands) where red foxes are absent or rare. Local eradication programs exist, although eradication has proven difficult due to the denning behaviour and nocturnal hunting, so the focus is on management with the introduction of state bounties. According to the Tasmanian government, red foxes were introduced to the previously fox-free island of Tasmania in 1999 or 2000, posing a significant threat to native wildlife including the eastern bettong, and an eradication program conducted by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water has been established.|$|R

40|$|Non-invasive {{methods of}} {{monitoring}} wild populations (such as genotyping faeces or hair) are now widely used and advocated. The potential advantages of such methods over traditional direct monitoring (such as live capture) are that accuracy improves because sampling of non-trappable individuals may be possible, species in difficult and remote terrain can be surveyed more efficiently, and disturbance to animals is minimal. Few studies have assessed {{the effects of}} interactions between species on remote sampling success. We test the use of non-invasive monitoring for the cryptic, forest-dwelling, solitary and endangered <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby</b> (Onychogalea fraenata) that is sympatric with the ecologically similar and more common black-striped wallaby (Macropus dorsalis). Six types of hair traps were tested for 3668 trap days, and hairs were caught with about a 10 % success rate. Camera traps showed that baited hair traps targeted both wallaby species. We microscopically identified hair as <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby</b> or black-striped wallaby. We compared these hairs and their genotypes (using seven microsatellite loci) with known <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby</b> hairs and genotypes derived from animal trapping. Trapped <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby</b> hairs had characteristics that could be mistaken for black-stripe wallaby hairs; characteristics were not diagnostic.

40|$|Translocation is an {{important}} tool {{for the conservation of}} species that have suffered severe range reductions. The success of a translocation should be measured not only by the survival of released animals, but by the reproductive output of individuals and hence the establishment of a self-sustaining population. The <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby</b> is an endangered Australian macropod that suffered an extensive range contraction to a single remaining wild population. A translocated population was established and subsequently monitored over a four year period. The aim {{of this study was to}} measure the reproductive success of released males using genetic tools and to determine the factors that predicted reproductive success. Captive-bred and wild-caught animals were released and we found significant variation in male reproductive success among release groups. Variation in reproductive success was best explained by individual male weight, survival and release location rather than origin. Only 26 % of candidate males were observed to sire an offspring during the study. The <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby</b> is a sexually dimorphic, polygynous macropod and reproductive success is skewed toward large males. Males over 5800 g were six times more likely to sire an offspring than males below this weight. This study highlights the importance of considering mating system when choosing animals for translocation. Translocation programs for polygynous species should release a greater proportion of females, and only release males of high breeding potential. By maximizing the reproductive output of released animals, conservation managers will reduce the costs of translocation and increase the chance of successfully establishing a self-sustaining population.

40|$|The <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby</b> is {{restricted}} to one locality in central Queensland, Australia. The population declined severely during a major drought between 1991 and 1995. We investigated age-specific covariates of survival and proximate causes of mortality from 1994 to 1997, using mark-recapture and radio-tagging techniques at two study sites. Using a matrix population model, we also modelled the effect of drought on age-specific survival and the intrinsic rate of population increase,;,. The only significant covariate of survival for adults was a measure of health unrelated to drought. Rainfall, food, predator activity, year, sex and habitat were not associated with variation in adult survival. Juvenile survival was negatively affected by drought, and predation was the proximate cause of most juvenile deaths. The matrix projection model showed that the observed juvenile survivorship during the drought was low enough to have produced a population decline, although fecundity and survival of other age classes was high throughout the study.

The pig-footed bandicoot (Chaeropus ecaudatus) and crescent <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby</b> (Onychogalea lunata) previously occurred in the subregion, but both are now extinct. The rufous hare-wallaby (Lagorchestes hirsutus) is now extinct in the wild, and a further ten species of mammal are extinct in the subregion.

40|$|Predation by {{introduced}} foxes {{and cats}} is generally {{thought to be}} the main reason for the poor success rate of macropod reintroductions on the Australian mainland. Predator-prey theory suggests that predation may have particularly severe impacts on very small populations, especially if a more common primary prey species is present (such as the rabbit). Thus, a sufficiently large reintroduction may overcome predation and succeed where a smaller one would fail. The minimum viable population would, however, be much larger than that predicted by standard population-viability analysis. We use a simple stochastic model based upon the <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby</b> to explore this possibility. Even very small amounts of predation (2 - 4 individuals per six months) can be sufficient to cause reintroductions of up to 50 animals to fail. No clear threshold population size beyond which reintroductions will succeed is evident and, for a given mean, the probability distribution of predation has a very limited impact on the success of reintroductions. In almost all circumstances, a single reintroduction of a given size is preferable to multiple reintroductions of the same total number of individuals...|$|E

40|$|Many {{species have}} {{suffered}} severe range contractions {{as a result}} of human impacts, and require careful management if they are to persist. An understanding of the ecology, population structure and mating system is important for the conservation of these endangered species. Translocation has become a widely used tool in the conservation of threatened species; however, without proper planning and monitoring, many programmes end in failure. The <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby</b> {{is one of the most}} endangered macropods in Australia, having suffered an extensive range contraction from the semi-arid region of eastern Australia to a single remnant population of ~ 500 animals at Taunton National Park in Queensland. In 1996, a translocated population of bridled nailtail wallabies was established at Idalia National Park, on the western edge of the former range of this species. The aims of this study were to: 1) determine the factors underlying variation in reproductive success among animals released at Idalia; 2) investigate the effects of a range decline on the genetic variation and population structure of the remnant population at Taunton; 3) assess the impact of captive breeding and translocation on the genetic diversity and structure of the established population at Idalia; and 4) investigate male and female mating strategies in this species. Chapter two investigated reproductive success among males released at Idalia National Park. The <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby</b> is a sexually dimorphic, polygynous species and there is a large amount of variation in male reproductive success. Animals of different origin were released, including animals bred in captivity off the park, animals bred on-site in enclosures, and wild-caught animals from the remnant population that were moved directly to Idalia. There was significant variation in reproductive success among males released, but the origin of those animals did not explain this variation. Instead, large males were the most reproductively successful regardless of origin. Survival probability and release location were also important factors. This study highlighted the importance of considering mating system when choosing animals for translocation and suggests that, for polygynous species, a greater proportion of females and males of high breeding potential should be released. In Chapter three I investigated the genetic diversity and fine-scale genetic structure of the remnant population at Taunton. This last remaining population has been isolated for at least 60 years, corresponding to 30 generations for this species. Animals are patchily distributed in assemblages of different size that cover ~ 10 % of suitable habitat on the park. Genetic diversity was surprisingly high within the population remnant and this species showed one of the highest levels of heterozygosity and allelic diversity of any macropod. The three sub-populations of animals sampled over 10 km were significantly differentiated, and fine-scale spatial genetic structure was also observed within a continuous sub-population of animals covering just 750 ha. Females were more related to each other than expected from random, whereas males were less related to each other than expected. Fine-scale genetic structure was observed among females but not males, providing evidence for female philopatry and male-biased dispersal. I suggest that fine-scale population structure and restricted gene flow among females but not males may maintain genetic diversity in this remnant population. Chapter four assessed the effect of translocation of animals of different origin on genetic diversity in bridled nailtail wallabies. Both wild-caught and captive-bred animals were initially released, but subsequent releases consisted of captive-bred animals only. In this study, I compared genetic diversity of released animals to animals sampled in the remnant population. Heterozygosity did not differ between the remnant and translocated population, however allelic diversity was significantly reduced among all groups released. Animals bred in captivity were significantly differentiated from the source population, whereas animals moved directly from Taunton were not. Releasing more captive-bred animals into the population after the initial release resulted in a decline in overall heterozygosity and allelic diversity. This study highlights the importance of sourcing animals directly from remnant populations in order to maintain genetic diversity and minimize genetic drift between source and recipient populations. The <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby</b> has a polygynous mating system and reproductive success is skewed toward large males. However unlike most polygynous, sexually dimorphic macropods, the <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby</b> is highly solitary; animals only associate to breed and males do not form stable dominance hierarchies. In Chapter five I investigated behavioural strategies used by males to secure matings, and mate choice among females. I found that males of different size adopted different mating strategies. Large males spent more time guarding females against other males and maintaining contact with them, whereas smaller males spent less time with guarded females in order to search for other females in oestrus. Females also preferred larger males and were more likely to engage in mate chases if there was a large number of males within the group...|$|E

40|$|The <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby</b> is {{a sexually}} size dimorphic, promiscuous, solitary macropod. Sex ratios of pouch young were studied at two sites over 3 years, {{beginning}} with 14 months of severe drought. Females {{that were in}} better condition {{were more likely to}} have sons, and condition was dependent on body size. Females at one site were heavier, were consequently in better condition, and produced more sons than females at the other site. Females that declined in condition had more daughters during the most severe part of the drought than females that maintained condition, but endoparasite infection did not affect the pouch young sex ratio. Age also appeared to affect sex ratio adjustment, because weight was strongly influenced by age. Sex ratio bias was not caused by early offspring mortality, but occurred at conception. Mothers did not appear to bias energy expenditure on sons or daughters; males and females did not differ in condition at the end of pouch life. Pouch young sex ratio variation was most consistent with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, but could also have been influenced by local resource competition, since sons dispersed further than daughters. Offspring condition was related to survival, and was correlated with maternal condition...|$|E
40|$|Woody {{regrowth}} is extensive on abandoned agricultural {{lands and}} developed pastures worldwide. Regrowth is actively controlled in working pastures. {{but it could be}} managed to offset greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and other emitting industries with supplementary benefits for biodiversity conservation. This paper explores the case of Brigalow regrowth in the extensive pastoral landscape of north-eastern Australia. By synthesising current ecological knowledge with relevant socio-economic and policy considerations, it examines the potential of the Brigalow regrowth ecosystem to provide dual carbon/biodiversity benefits. Brigalow regrowth sequesters large amounts of carbon, especially when compared to other ecosystems from similar sub-humid climates. In addition, restoring regrowth is likely to have benefits {{for a wide range of}} native flora and fauna, including the endangered <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby.</b> However, there are knowledge gaps relating to the landscape ecology of Brigalow regrowth and the impacts of management and climate change on carbon/restoration potential. Also, a conflict exists between short-term carbon sequestration and long-term restoration goals and we suggest a role for restoration thinning to resolve this. Regional demand for high biomass regrowth as a carbon offset is likely to be high but ambiguities in carbon policy threaten to diminish the use of natural regrowth for reforestation projects.

We evaluated {{the outcome of a}} reintroduction of the <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby</b> Onychogalea fraenata to Avocet Nature Refuge, a private refuge in central Queensland, Australia. This macropod was also reintroduced to Idalia National Park in western Queensland in 1996 and occurs in one natural population in central Queensland. We estimated population growth, adult and juvenile survival, and distribution changes since the last release of O. fraenata to Avocet in 2005, and evaluated female reproductive success and health. Although animals were in good condition, population size was a tenth of that of the 1996 Idalia reintroduction reported after 3 years and, unlike at Idalia, juvenile survival at Avocet was low. The likely causes are consistent with predictors of translocation and reintroduction failures in mammals. These are predation, the small number of individuals in each release, the likely suboptimal health status of reintroduced individuals, drought, and possibly lack of dispersal from the small area of preferred habitat. The lessons of this reintroduction are that future attempts are likely to have the best chance of success if they occur in non-drought years, at sites with large, non-fragmented areas of brigalow forest, involve the release of large groups of animals together, and are accompanied by intensive, long-term baiting to control introduced predators...|$|E
40|$|The <b>bridled</b> <b>nailtail</b> <b>wallaby,</b> Onychogalea fraenata, is a {{relatively}} small, solitary and sexually size dimorphic macropod. We studied the mating system of free-ranging wallabies over 3 years, using microsatellite analysis of paternity, radiotelemetry and behavioural observations. Both sexes were promiscuous, and general reproductive behaviour {{was similar to that}} of larger, better-known macropods. Home range size influenced the number of associations with oestrous females, and was a significant component of male reproductive success. Female population density varied within the site, but males with home ranges that overlapped more females did not sire more offspring. Aggression between males occurred only around oestrous females and males did not establish a predetermined dominance hierarchy. Male body weight strongly influenced priority of access to oestrous females, and was related to age. The number of times that males were seen closest to an oestrous female when other males were present (priority of access) was the most important predictor of variation in the number of offspring sired. Females mated with several males within and between oestrous cycles, and may have influenced male–male competition by prolonging advertisement of approaching oestrus, expanding their home ranges at oestrus and engaging in mate chases that attracted groups of up to six males. Despite overall similarities in the mating system of this species and that of other macropods, male mating success may be less skewed in bridled nailtail wallabies than in other species, although paternity analysis of free-ranging populations of other species is required to confirm this conclusion...|$|E
