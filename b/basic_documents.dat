2500|$|In 2009 the Committee on the Honouring of Obligations and Commitments of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe {{asked the}} European Commission for Democracy Through Law (Venice Commission) for {{an opinion on}} the law on {{occupied}} territories of Georgia. The Commission's resulting March 2009 report criticised the Georgian law. The law was at odds with UN Security Council resolutions that were binding both on the Russian Federation and on Georgia. The report said that the law raised concerns [...] "with regard to humanitarian access to the conflict affected areas." [...] The terms used in Article 2 contradicted 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Limitation on free migration [...] "may be in contradiction with the Georgian international engagements." [...] The Commission also stressed Georgia's obligation to respect the 1951 Refugee Convention. The commission also criticised the law's lack of clarity, saying that [...] "the text {{of the law is}} not clear." [...] In its aspects dealing with private property (Article 5), it might have violated Article 1 of the First Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the principle of proportionality, as well as additionally violating further aspects of the Hague Convention (The Laws and Customs of War on Land). A restriction and criminalisation of economic activities (Article 6) was contrary to the rule of customary international law, and also the IV Geneva Convention. The Commission also recommended [...] "to insert a clarifying provision" [...] into the law regarding <b>basic</b> <b>documents</b> issued by illegal authorities concerning the personal status.|$|E
2500|$|Gary Marshall of TechRadar commented in 2016 that [...] "Where Office {{tries to}} do {{everything}} imaginable, Google's suite is much more basic. That said, it's much more powerful {{than it was when}} the package debuted in 2006, but the emphasis on simplicity and speed remains." [...] Marshall wrote that [...] "We wouldn't want to craft a massive, complicated manuscript in Docs, but then that isn't what Docs is designed to do. It's a fast and user-friendly way to create everyday documents and to share them with colleagues and clients", and that fellow service Google Sheets [...] "covers the most common Excel functions [...] but doesn't have the power of Microsoft's offering". Marshall praised collaboration for being [...] "effortless", and praised importing of external file formats and making those editable and collaborative for being a [...] "big selling point". PC Magazines Eric Grevstad wrote that [...] "what's online is what you get", adding that [...] "configuring them to [...] is a rigmarole". He stated that the package was [...] "an illustration of software's version of the 80/20 rule [...] 80 percent of users will never need more than 20 percent of the features". He stated that [...] "comparing [...] to Office 2016 is like bringing a handgun to a cannon fight [...] Microsoft's PC-based suite is designed to have almost every feature anyone might ever need; Google's online suite is designed to have most features most people use daily." [...] Tom's Hardwares James Gaskin wrote that [...] "like most Google products, it can claim the cleanest and most minimal interface in the market", and [...] "No other suite except Office 365 can get close to the ease of collaboration Google provides. And even Microsoft's product trails by a wide margin as changes only appear in real-time in Word 2016, not the other apps". Conclusively, he wrote: [...] "The progress made between the first Google App release and now has been considerable. As the world moves to more and more mobile computing, Google has a distinct advantage. But tradition dies hard, and those who build more than <b>basic</b> <b>documents,</b> spreadsheets, and presentations will remain tied to their desktops and laptops for the time being." ...|$|E
