5|$|Adam Williams (Sterling K. Brown) is {{a police}} officer with <b>bulimia.</b> He abuses his {{authority}} to extort food from restaurants and delivery people, which eventually costs him his job.|$|E
5|$|Little {{comprehensive}} {{data regarding}} rumination syndrome in otherwise healthy individuals exists because most sufferers are private about their illness {{and are often}} misdiagnosed due {{to the number of}} symptoms and the clinical similarities between rumination syndrome and other disorders of the stomach and esophagus, such as gastroparesis and <b>bulimia</b> nervosa. These symptoms include the acid-induced erosion of the esophagus and enamel, halitosis, malnutrition, severe weight loss and an unquenchable appetite. Individuals may begin regurgitating within a minute following ingestion, and the full cycle of ingestion and regurgitation can mimic the binging and purging of <b>bulimia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{in adults}} {{is a complicated}} disorder whose symptoms can mimic those of several other gastroesophogeal disorders and diseases. <b>Bulimia</b> nervosa and gastroparesis are especially prevalent among the misdiagnoses of rumination.|$|E
5|$|During her {{sophomore year}} of high school, after Wilson's {{interest}} in modeling grew more serious, her mother urged her to pursue it. They visited an agency and were informed that Wilson would have to lose weight {{to be considered for}} jobs. In the process of losing weight, she began a bout with anorexia nervosa and then <b>bulimia</b> that lasted from ages 14-to-20.|$|E
5|$|She {{suffered}} from <b>bulimia</b> very badly. That's not, like, a revelation – you knew {{just by looking}} at her… She would have died eventually, the way she was going, but what really killed her was the bulimia… I think that it left her weaker and more susceptible. Had she not had an eating disorder, she would have been physically stronger.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{season of}} Degrassi: The Next Generation {{was the most}} {{successful}} season to date, averaging 767,000 viewers in Canada, and had one episode watched by a million viewers. It received praise for its depiction of a relationship between two gay characters, but mixed reviews for highlighting the issue of anorexia and <b>bulimia</b> in teenage girls.|$|E
5|$|Gascoigne {{has three}} autobiographies: Gazza: My Story (with Hunter Davies) {{published}} in 2004, Being Gazza: Tackling My Demons (with Hunter Davies and John McKeown), published in 2006, and Glorious: My World, Football and Me, published in 2011. In Gazza: My Story, and in Being Gazza: Tackling My Demons, {{he refers to}} treatment for <b>bulimia,</b> obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, and alcoholism. The books also describes his addictive personality, which has led him to develop addictions of varying severity on alcohol, cocaine, chain smoking, gambling, high-caffeine energy drinks, exercise, and junk food.|$|E
5|$|In {{adults and}} adolescents, {{hypothesized}} causes generally fall {{into one of}} either category: habit-induced, and trauma-induced. Habit-induced individuals generally have a history of <b>bulimia</b> nervosa or of intentional regurgitation (magicians and professional regurgitators, for example), which though initially self-induced, forms a subconscious habit that can continue to manifest itself outside the control of the affected individual. Trauma-induced individuals describe an emotional or physical injury (such as recent surgery, psychological distress, concussions, deaths in the family, etc.), which preceded the onset of rumination, often by several months.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 2014, Kesha {{checked into}} Timberline Knolls Residential Treatment Center, a rehab {{facility}} in Lemont, Illinois, for eating disorder treatment. Kesha's mother Pebe Sebert {{confirmed that the}} eating disorder Kesha was suffering with is <b>bulimia</b> nervosa {{and that she had}} been struggling with it since she was signed. She also alleged that Dr. Luke was partly the cause of Kesha's eating disorder, saying that Luke had allegedly told her to lose weight after he signed her, comparing the shape of her body to a refrigerator. Sebert asserted that this had caused Kesha's disorder to worsen. Kesha had completed her treatment on March 6, 2014, after spending two months in rehab.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} which affects {{the functioning of the}} stomach and esophagus, also known as a functional gastroduodenal disorder. In patients that have a history of eating disorders, Rumination {{syndrome is}} grouped alongside eating disorders such as <b>bulimia</b> and pica, which are themselves grouped under non-psychotic mental disorder. In most healthy adolescents and adults who have no mental disability, Rumination syndrome is considered a motility disorder instead of an eating disorder, because the patients tend to have had no control over its occurrence and have had no history of eating disorders.|$|E
5|$|Supportive {{therapy and}} diaphragmatic {{breathing}} has shown to cause improvement in 56% of cases, and total cessation of symptoms in an additional 30% {{in one study}} of 54 adolescent patients who were followed up 10 months after initial treatments. Patients who successfully use the technique often notice an immediate change in health for the better. Individuals who have had <b>bulimia</b> or who intentionally induced vomiting {{in the past have}} a reduced chance for improvement due to the reinforced behavior. The technique is not used with infants or young children due to the complex timing and concentration required for it to be successful. Most infants grow out of the disorder within a year or with aversive training.|$|E
5|$|The drug label advises that {{bupropion}} {{should not}} be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, <b>bulimia</b> nervosa, active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use and/or withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are also taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). When switching from MAOIs to bupropion, {{it is important to}} include a washout period of about two weeks between the medications. The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{most of the}} series' run, Blair grapples with {{a number}} of changes within her family. Two years prior to the opening novel, Blair's parents {{divorced}} after her father ran off with another man. When her mother remarries, and her father leaves the country, Blair has difficulty accepting her stepfather, Cyrus Rose. In addition, her stress over these matters occasionally affects her other relationships. However, Blair ultimately remains close to her father Harold, who she often turns to for comfort. By contrast, she maintains a somewhat tenser relationship with her mother Eleanor. It is also revealed that Blair has struggled with <b>bulimia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dave Piaseki (Steven Demarco) and Linda Chapman (Zakiya Cook) {{are found}} shot dead {{in their car}} at Fairmount Park. When Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and detectives Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) and Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) arrive, they think the case is a Murder–suicide, but Megan finds two bullets in Dave and concludes that someone murdered them. Megan meets Linda's parents, Al (Barry Shabaka Henley) and Laura (Brenda Pressley), and tells them the news, leaving them devastated. Megan links Linda's ex-boyfriend Brian Hall (Brian White) to Dave and finds out that Dave was at Brian's {{restaurant}} the night he died. However, Brian has an alibi as he was with employee Nina Wheeler (Sherri Saum). The police find out that Linda {{used to work at}} Brian's restaurant and received psychological abuse until Dave found out and confronted him. Brian has started to abuse Nina, so the police get Nina away from Brian, as he caused Linda to suffer from <b>bulimia</b> due to the abuse.|$|E
5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and <b>bulimia.</b> The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may be more accurate to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 Michael filed a {{malpractice}} {{suit against}} Terri's obstetrician {{on the basis}} that he failed to diagnose <b>bulimia</b> as the cause of her infertility. Terri had gone to the doctor because she had stopped menstruating but the doctor had failed to take her medical history into account which might have revealed an eating disorder. During the case, one of Terri's friends testified that she knew Schiavo was bulimic. In November 1992, Michael won the case and was awarded $6.8 million by the jury, later reduced to $2 million as Terri was found partly at fault for her condition. After attorneys' fees and other expenses, Michael received $300,000 and $750,000 was put in a trust fund for Terri's medical care. According to Michael, in early 2003 the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.|$|E
5|$|Season 4 {{continues}} in Lima {{with a new}} generation of students but also follows some of the McKinley graduates from the third season, notably to the fictional New York Academy of the Dramatic Arts (NYADA) in New York City. The season follows the club through a loss at the Sectionals competition (episode 9) and subsequent reinstatement when the winning Dalton Academy Warblers were found to have used banned substances (human growth hormone) (episode 12) before winning at the Regionals competition (episode 22), which meant they would be attending their third consecutive National show choir competition. In the meantime, Rachel Berry and Kurt Hummel navigate NYADA and their lives as aspiring performers, plus their relationships with Finn and Blaine. Issues during the season include sex, <b>bulimia,</b> gender identity, child molestation, dyslexia, school violence, and pregnancy scares. Former main cast members Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) were credited as guest stars, while previously recurring glee club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) was promoted to the main cast.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} {{documented}} mechanism {{is that the}} ingestion of food causes gastric distention, which is followed by abdominal compression and the simultaneous relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This creates a common cavity between the stomach and the oropharynx that allows the partially digested material {{to return to the}} mouth. There are several offered explanations for the sudden relaxation of the LES. Among these explanations {{is that it is a}} learned voluntary relaxation, which is common in those with or having had <b>bulimia.</b> While this relaxation may be voluntary, the overall process of rumination is still generally involuntary. Relaxation due to intra-abdominal pressure is another proposed explanation, which would make abdominal compression the primary mechanism. The third is an adaptation of the belch reflex, which is the most commonly described mechanism. The swallowing of air immediately prior to regurgitation causes the activation of the belching reflex that triggers the relaxation of the LES. Patients often describe a feeling similar to the onset of a belch preceding rumination.|$|E
5|$|As Lois finds Chris and {{his friends}} {{watching}} a pornographic film, she becomes convinced a proper sex-ed class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about safe sex, but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of Peter, who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform premarital sex, rather than abstinence. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She {{is replaced by a}} reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including Meg, who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, Stewie loses a tooth and is told about the tooth fairy. Frightened by the fairy tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes Brian's girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has <b>bulimia</b> nervosa, in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth fetish, stealing teeth to roll around in them.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with <b>bulimia</b> since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E
25|$|Globally, <b>bulimia</b> was {{estimated}} to affect 3.6 million people in 2015. About 1% of young women have <b>bulimia</b> at a given point in time and about 2% to 3% of women have the condition {{at some point in}} their lives. The condition is less common in the developing world. <b>Bulimia</b> is about nine times more likely to occur in women than men. Among women, rates are highest in young adults. <b>Bulimia</b> was named and first described by the British psychiatrist Gerald Russell in 1979.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bulimia</b> {{has been}} {{compared}} to drug addiction, though the empirical support for this characterization is limited. However, people with <b>bulimia</b> nervosa may share dopamine D2 receptor-related vulnerabilities with those with substance abuse disorders.|$|E
25|$|Those {{with the}} eating {{disorder}} <b>bulimia</b> {{are more likely}} to develop Barrett’s esophagus because <b>bulimia</b> can cause severe acid reflux (and purging obviously floods the esophagus with acid the same way acid reflux disease would).|$|E
25|$|A {{considerable}} amount of literature has identified a correlation between sexual abuse {{and the development of}} <b>bulimia</b> nervosa. The reported incident rate of unwanted sexual contact is higher among those with <b>bulimia</b> nervosa than anorexia nervosa.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, Byrne and Mclean's {{findings}} differed {{slightly from}} Fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model of <b>bulimia</b> nervosa {{in that the}} drive for thinness was the major cause of purging {{as a way of}} controlling weight. In turn, Byrne and Mclean argued that this makes the individual vulnerable to binging, indicating {{that it is not a}} binge-purge cycle but rather a purge-binge cycle in that purging comes before bingeing. Similarly, Fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model of <b>bulimia</b> nervosa is not necessarily applicable to every individual and is certainly reductionist. Everyone differs from another, and taking such a complex behavior like <b>bulimia</b> and applying the same one theory to everyone would certainly be invalid. In addition, the cognitive behavioral model of <b>bulimia</b> nervosa is very cultural bound in that it may not be necessarily applicable to cultures outside of the Western society. To evaluate, Fairburn et al..'s model and more generally the cognitive explanation of <b>bulimia</b> nervosa is more descriptive than explanatory, as it does not necessarily explain how <b>bulimia</b> arises. Furthermore, it is difficult to ascertain cause and effect, because it may be that distorted eating leads to distorted cognition rather than vice versa.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bulimia</b> nervosa, {{also known}} as simply <b>bulimia,</b> is an eating {{disorder}} characterized by binge eating followed by purging. Binge eating refers to eating {{a large amount of}} food in a short amount of time. Purging refers to the attempts {{to get rid of the}} food consumed. This may be done by vomiting or taking laxatives. Other efforts to lose weight may include the use of diuretics, stimulants, water fasting, or excessive exercise. Most people with <b>bulimia</b> are at a normal weight. The forcing of vomiting may result in thickened skin on the knuckles and breakdown of the teeth. <b>Bulimia</b> is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and problems with drugs or alcohol. There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm.|$|E
25|$|Antidepressants of the {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) class {{may have a}} modest benefit. This includes fluoxetine, which is FDA approved, {{for the treatment of}} <b>bulimia,</b> other antidepressants such as sertraline may also be effective against <b>bulimia.</b> Topiramate may also be useful but has greater side effects.|$|E
25|$|Most recently, {{estrogen}} {{has been}} used in experimental research as a way to treat women suffering from <b>bulimia</b> nervosa, in addition to cognitive behavioral therapy, which is the established standard for treatment in <b>bulimia</b> cases. The estrogen research hypothesizes that the disease may be linked to a hormonal imbalance in the brain.|$|E
25|$|People with <b>bulimia</b> nervosa {{may also}} {{exercise}} {{to a point}} that excludes other activities.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy is}} the primary treatment for <b>bulimia.</b> Antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or tricyclic antidepressant class may have a modest benefit. While outcomes with <b>bulimia</b> are typically better than in those of anorexia, {{the risk of death}} among those affected is higher than that of the general population. At 10 years after receiving treatment about 50% of people are fully recovered.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{treatment}} given to those suffering with <b>bulimia</b> nervosa; psychopharmacological and psychosocial treatments.|$|E
25|$|Maudsley family therapy, {{developed}} at the Maudsley Hospital in London {{for the treatment of}} anorexia has been shown promising results in <b>bulimia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mental/Psychiatric/Behavioral/Learning {{conditions}} include, but are {{not limited}} to: depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, anorexia nervosa, <b>bulimia</b> nervosa, and schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|In April 2008, Prescott recounted having {{suffered}} from the eating disorder <b>bulimia</b> nervosa, which he believed was brought on by stress, from the 1980s until 2007.|$|E
25|$|The {{onset of}} <b>bulimia</b> nervosa is often during adolescence, between 13 and 20 years of age, and many cases have {{previously}} suffered from obesity, with many sufferers relapsing in adulthood into episodic bingeing and purging even after initially successful treatment and remission. A lifetime prevalence of 0.5 percent and 0.9 percent for adult and adolescent sufferers, respectively, is estimated among the United States population. <b>Bulimia</b> nervosa may affect up to 1% {{of young women}} and, after 10 years of diagnosis, half will recover fully, a third will recover partially, and 10–20% will still have symptoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bulimia</b> {{also has}} {{negative}} effects on the sufferer's dental health due to the acid passed through the mouth from frequent vomiting causing acid erosion, mainly on the posterior dental surface.|$|E
