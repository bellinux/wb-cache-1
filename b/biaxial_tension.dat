The samples fabricated under uniform triaxial compression with and without pins exhibited similar cell structure and mechanical properties. The sheets fabricated with graded compression levels displayed clearly defined quadrants of differing cell structure and mechanical properties. The graded foam quadrants subject to triaxial compression displayed similar cell structure, tangent moduli and negative Poisson’s ratio responses to the uniform foams converted with a similar level of triaxial compression. The graded foam quadrants subject to through-thickness compression and <b>biaxial</b> planar <b>tension</b> displayed a slightly re-entrant through-thickness cell structure contrasting with an in-plane structure resembling the fully reticulated cell structure of the unconverted parent foam. This quadrant of graded foam displayed positive and negative Poisson’s ratios in tension and compression, respectively, accompanied by high and low in-plane tangent modulus, respectively. The strain-dependent mechanical properties are shown to be fully consistent with expectations from honeycomb theory. The triaxially compressed quadrants of the graded sheet exhibited ~ 4 times lower peak acceleration than quadrants with through-thickness compression and <b>biaxial</b> planar <b>tension</b> in 6 J impact tests using a steel hemispherical drop mass...|$|R

40|$|In {{this report}} (prepared in {{collaboration}} with Prof. Jeong Whan Yoon, Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia) a research {{effort was made to}} develop a non associated flow rule for zirconium. Since Zr is a hexagonally close packed (hcp) material, it is impossible to describe its plastic response under arbitrary loading conditions with any associated flow rule (e. g. von Mises). As a result of strong tension compression asymmetry of the yield stress and anisotropy, zirconium displays plastic behavior that requires a more sophisticated approach. Consequently, a new general asymmetric yield function has been developed which accommodates mathematically the four directional anisotropies along 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, and <b>biaxial,</b> under <b>tension</b> and compression. Stress anisotropy has been completely decoupled from the r value by using non associated flow plasticity, where yield function and plastic potential have been treated separately to take care of stress and r value directionalities, respectively. This theoretical development has been verified using Zr alloys at room temperature as an example as these materials have very strong SD (Strength Differential) effect. The proposed yield function reasonably well models the evolution of yield surfaces for a zirconium clock rolled plate during in plane and through thickness compression. It has been found that this function can predict both tension and compression asymmetry mathematically without any numerical tolerance and shows the significant improvement compared to any reported functions.

This thesis encompasses an experimental investigation and theoretical modelling of the cracking behaviour of concrete panels reinforced with glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars under uniaxial and biaxial direct tensile loading conditions. [...] In the experimental phase of this investigation, a special setup is designed to test reinforced concrete panels under uniaxial and <b>biaxial</b> <b>tension.</b> The setup accommodates concrete panels that are reinforced with GFRP and/or steel reinforcing bars. The setup is used to carry out an experimental test program on twelve reinforced concrete panels under uniaxial and <b>biaxial</b> <b>tension.</b> The test parameters are the concrete strength, concrete cover to bar diameter ratio, bar spacing, reinforcement ratio, and bar type (GFRP or steel). The crack patterns, crack widths, and spacings are investigated. The tensile stress-strain relationships, and thus the tension stiffening behaviour, are examined. The tension stiffening behaviour is the concrete contribution in resisting part of the tensile stresses applied. [...] The experimental results reveal that the crack development under <b>biaxial</b> <b>tension</b> affects the magnitude of the stress in the GFRP-reinforced concrete panels resulting in a decrease in the cracking loads and stresses. GFRP-reinforced concrete panels under uniaxial tension experience an increase in the tension stiffening contribution compared to steel-reinforced concrete at the same level of stress. However, this contribution is not significant under <b>biaxial</b> <b>tension.</b> GFRP-reinforced concrete panels under <b>biaxial</b> <b>tension</b> experience much less tension stiffening contribution than those under uniaxial tension due to different cracking mechanisms for both cases. In general, there is an increase in the tension stiffening contribution of GFRP-RC panels due to the decrease in the reinforcement ratio. The area of the effective tension zone of GFRP-reinforced concrete is found to be almost half the size of those that develop around steel reinforcing bars. The use of an effective tension zone for GFRP-reinforced concrete equal to seven times the bar diameter is recommended rather than using 15 times the bar diameter which is commonly used for steel reinforcing bars. The use of high strength concrete causes a reduction in the total number of visible cracks, and thus enhancing the structural behaviour of GFRP-reinforced concrete panels. [...] An analytical cracking model is developed to predict the crack spacing and width of GFRP-reinforced concrete. The model accounts for the bond stress transfer mechanism and surface characteristics of the reinforcing bar. The model is validated through comparisons with test results and other existing experimental data The proposed model is very suitable to predict the cracking variables of GFRP-reinforced concrete. Furthermore, a tension stiffening constitutive model is proposed for non-linear finite element analysis of GFRP-reinforced concrete. The proposed model accounts for the <b>biaxial</b> <b>tension</b> strength envelope. The model assumes a bi-linear relation in the post-cracking range to reflect the tensile behaviour of the tested GFRP-reinforced concrete panels.

40|$|AbstractAn {{elastoplastic}} multi-level damage model considering evolutionary weakened interface {{is developed}} {{in this work}} to predict the effective elastoplastic behavior and multi-level damage evolution in particle reinforced ductile matrix composites (PRDMCs). The elastoplastic multi-level damage model is micromechanically derived {{on the basis of}} the ensemble-volume averaging procedure and the first-order effects of eigenstrains. The Eshelby’s tensor for an ellipsoidal inclusion with slightly weakened interface [Qu, J., 1993 a. Eshelby tensor for an elastic inclusion with slightly weakened interfaces. Journal of Applied Mechanics 60 (4), 1048 – 1050; Qu, J., 1993 b. The effect of slightly weakened interfaces on the overall elastic properties of composite materials. Mechanics of Materials, 14, 269 – 281] is adopted to model particles having mildly or severely weakened interface, and a multi-level damage model [Lee, H. K., Pyo, S. H., in press. Multi-level modeling of effective elastic behavior and progressive weakened interface in particulate composites. Composites Science and Technology] in accordance with the Weibull’s probabilistic function is employed to describe the sequential, progressive weakened interface in the composites. Numerical examples corresponding to uniaxial, <b>biaxial</b> and triaxial <b>tension</b> loadings are solved to illustrate the potential of the proposed micromechanical framework. A series of parametric analysis are carried out to investigate the influence of model parameters on the progression of weakened interface in the composites. Furthermore, the present prediction is compared with available experimental data in the literature to verify the proposed elastoplastic multi-level damage model...|$|R
