Sexton relocated all coffee and spice <b>blending</b> <b>operations</b> to Pittsburgh. The investment banking firm of Floyd D. Cerf Company of Chicago represented Sexton in the transaction.

5000|$|Consider {{the case}} when we have four layers to blend to produce the final image: F=A*(B*(C*D)) where A, B, C, D are {{partially}} transparent image layers and [...] "*" [...] denotes a compositing operator (with the left layer {{on top of the}} right layer). If only layer C changes, we should find a way to avoid re-blending all of the layers when computing F. Without any special considerations, four full-image blends would need to occur. For compositing operators that are commutative, such as additive blending, it is safe to re-order the <b>blending</b> <b>operations.</b> In this case, we might compute T=A*(B*D) only once and simply blend T*C to produce F, a single operation. Unfortunately, most operators are not commutative. However, many are associative, suggesting it is safe to re-group operations to F=(A*B)*(C*D), i.e. without changing their order. In this case we may compute S:=A*B once and save this result. To form F with an associative operator, we need only do two additional compositing operations to integrate the new layer S, by computing F:=S*(C*D). Note that this expression indicates compositing C with all of the layers below it in one step and then blending all of the layers on top of it with the previous result to produce the final image in the second step.|$|E
40|$|We discuss new {{analytical}} formulations for localized and controllable <b>blending</b> <b>operations</b> in the functionbased solid modeling. The blending set {{operations are}} defined using R-functions and displacement functions with the localized area of influence. The shape {{and location of}} the blend are controlled by an additional bounding solid thus turning the operation into a ternary one. We also describe {{a new approach to}} solving the problem of shape metamorphosis between k-dimensional shapes by applying space-time bounded blending to the specially constructed (k+ 1) dimensional half-cylinders and making cross-sections for getting intermediate shapes under the transformation. 1 Blending in solid modeling <b>Blending</b> <b>operations</b> in solid modeling generate smooth transitions between two or several surfaces. Blending is also considered a natural property of implicit surfaces, where the basic operation is an algebraic sum (or difference) between skeleton-based scalar fields. <b>Blending</b> <b>operations</b> are typically used in computer-aided design for modeling fillets and chamfers. These operations are usually smooth versions of set-theoretic operations on solids (intersection, union, and difference), which approximate exact results of these operations by rounding sharp edges and vertices. The major requirements to <b>blending</b> <b>operations</b> [1] are tangency of the blend surface with the initial surfaces, automatic clipping of unwanted parts of the blending surface, C 1 continuity of the blending function everywhere in the domain, support of added and subtracted material blends. Special attention is paid to the intuitive control of the blend shape and position: the construction of the blend and its parameters should have clear geometric interpretation...|$|E
30|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} features of implicit modeling is that different individually modeled shapes can be combined easily by using some very simple implicit shape-blending functions. In general, any binary function O(x,y) can be used to combine two implicit functions. Let F 1 (X), F 2 (X) be the implicit functions corresponding to the shapes A,B. Then, the compound function O(F 1 (X),F 2 (X)) defines a new implicit function, whose corresponding geometric shape can be regarded as the combination of the shape A and the shape B. For instance, when an implicitly defined geometric shape is regarded as a solid, the binary functions O(x,y) corresponding to point-set theoretical operations like union, intersection, and subtraction operations can be defined directly by using max(x,y) or min(x,y). However, geometric shapes obtained from such simple binary operations are in general not smooth at the joint. To achieve smooth blending at the joint of two implicit shapes, a certain smooth blending operation has to be used. Some basic requirements to define a “good” blending operation have been proposed in [42, 43]. Even though in general there are no commonly accepted criteria about exactly whether a blending operation is “good”, it is generally agreed on that a good blending operation should not only be able to generate smooth implicit shapes, but can also be performed in a controllable way. To be more specific, we expect a blending operation to possess a kind of a shape-preserving property. To smoothly combine two implicit shapes, some local deformation of the original shapes is inevitable, but we want the local deformation to apply only to the regions close to where the two geometric shapes intersect. The shape-preserving feature of an implicit blending operation is of essential importance. This is because, with the availability of shape-preserving <b>blending</b> <b>operations,</b> a complicated task of designing a relatively complex geometric object can be sub-divided into a set of simple geometric object-design tasks. So far, several smooth shape-preserving <b>blending</b> <b>operations</b> have been proposed. In [42], smooth-blending range-controllable operations were defined by using a scalar function. In [43], the R-function was used to achieve the blending features. Smooth shape-preserving Boolean operators were also introduced in the work of Barthe et al. [44]. The major limitation of all these <b>blending</b> <b>operations</b> is that they only have the C 1 or the G 1 continuity and lack simplicity in their geometric representations. Comparatively, the piecewise polynomial-blending operations (PPBO) proposed in [15] have several advantages. PPBO are not only shape-preserving, but they can also be defined directly to have any required degree of smoothness. In addition, they are defined as piecewise polynomials and have a simple form in their mathematical expressions. A brief survey of various <b>blending</b> <b>operations</b> can be found in [45], though {{there is a lack of}} a sufficient review of shape-preserving <b>blending</b> <b>operations.</b> Owing to the importance of the shape-preserving feature of a blending operation in implicit modeling, here we give a brief introduction to PPBO.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Implicit {{modelling}} is {{a powerful}} technique to design geometric shapes, where a geometric object is de-scribed by a real function. In general, the real functions used in implicit modelling are unbounded and can take any values in space R. In general, the shapes described by different level sets of an unbounded implicit function can be varied significantly and are very unpredictable. In addition, allowing the underlying implicit function to take negative values also makes the construction of shape <b>blending</b> <b>operations</b> a difficult task. In this paper, we propose an implicit shape modelling technique, where each implicit shape is represented as the membership function of a fuzzy set which is bounded and nonnegative with value taken in [0, 1]. The most obvious benefit of representing an implicit shape as fuzzy set is that the blending {{of a set of}} implicit shapes is simply a problem of aggregating a set of fuzzy sets, which can be done in various ways by choosing a proper fuzzy set aggregation operator {{from a wide variety of}} fuzzy set operations.

One {{is to put the}} light component oil into the heavy one, and the other the opposite, putting the heavy component oil into the light one. There are a variety of indicators to evaluate the quality of refined products, such as oxidation stability, sulfur content, octane number, ash, copper corrosion, moisture, mechanical impurities, lubricity, kinematic viscosity, pour point, cold filter plugging point, flash point, distillation range, density. The quality of the original oil is no doubt affected by the <b>blending</b> <b>operation.</b> The <b>blending</b> capacity means that maximum volume of contaminated oil can be treated under the premise of ensuring the oil’s standard. In actual production, due to production parameters, material ratio and other differences, the same kind of oil produced at different times will also have some differences. In other words, the oil may have different blending capacities. Considering the nonlinear effects of the blending oil on the physical properties and the mixing of different kinds of oils with different physical properties in a tank, the problem is more complex.|$|R
