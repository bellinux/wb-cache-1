5|$|At {{the end of}} the novel, Charles {{returns from}} Europe; he and Mary {{establish}} something of a life together, but Mary is unhealthy and can barely stand to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> room with her husband; the last few lines of the novel imply that she will die young.|$|E
5|$|The £1 stamp {{issued in}} Jamaica (1956–58) in {{the reign of}} King George VI shows Tobacco Growing and Cigar Making. The first stamp for Queen Elizabeth II was to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> design (chocolate and violet) but was {{abandoned}} after printing. There are only seven examples in existence.|$|E
5|$|The {{criticism}} {{against the}} artistic freedom of giving a personal {{interpretation of a}} distant historic event, could have been directed at many other historic paintings of the 19th century. The criticism against Midvinterblot would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> vein during the following years. Larsson retorted that he would happily delegate the task to a younger talent—but he made a second version in oil (№ 237) in which he made the temple wider and where he added an executioner in the centre. The sets of characters were more closely assembled and the frieze-like quality was enhanced.|$|E
50|$|In 2D, {{rotations}} by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> angle <b>in</b> {{either direction}} <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> class. Glide reflections with translation by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> distance <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> class.|$|R

5|$|There {{were great}} {{expectations}} for Kuch Kuch Hota Hai {{leading up to}} its premiere, because it re-united the Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge team of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, and specifically concerning the debut of Karan Johar, whether he would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> league as Aditya Chopra as a first-time writer/director.|$|E
5|$|Viral genomes are circular, {{as in the}} polyomaviruses, or linear, as in the adenoviruses. The type of {{nucleic acid}} is {{irrelevant}} {{to the shape of}} the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. However, all segments are not required to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by brome mosaic virus and several other plant viruses.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} SaGa 1 was {{composed}} by Nobuo Uematsu, {{and that of}} SaGa 2 by Uematsu and Kenji Ito, while the music of SaGa 3 was composed by Ryuji Sasai and Chihiro Fujioka. Uematsu has stated that while SaGa 1s music could be made of better quality, the emphasis was on enjoying the game, and not solely its appearance or sound. The Game Boy's sound hardware was {{different from that of}} the Famicom, which Uematsu was used to composing for at the time, with new stereo and waveforms and only three notes; as a result, Uematsu struggled with deciding how to work with these, developing new themes for the music in the process despite SaGa 1s director Akitoshi Kawazu's desire to have the music <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> vein as Square's preceding Final Fantasy titles. Uematsu has stated that the Game Boy was a system he would like to compose for again. SaGa 2 was the first soundtrack or album that Kenji Ito worked on.|$|E
40|$|Summary. In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} general position. We also show some auxiliary theorems for proving Jordan curve theorem. The following main theorems are proved: 1. End points of a polygon <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> component of a complement of another polygon if number of common points of these polygons is even; 2. Two points of polygon L <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> component of a complement of polygon M if two points of polygon M <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> component of polygon L...|$|R
50|$|A spinor genus is an {{equivalence}} class for this equivalence relation.

5|$|There is {{no direct}} mention of Ivalice in Vagrant Story. However, several {{references}} are made; the Kingdom of Valendia, {{the setting for}} Vagrant Story, shares its name with a continent of Ivalice appearing in Final Fantasy XII. The Kiltia religion, featured in Final Fantasy XII, was {{the religion of the}} ghost town Leá Monde, in which the story takes place. Additionally, a quotation from Arazlam J. Durai, a famous historian of Ivalice who lived 400 years after the War of the Lions (and narrator of the Zodiac Brave Story told in Final Fantasy Tactics), is used {{at the beginning of the}} game, and the descriptions of several items make direct reference to the same story. This would seem to place Vagrant Story latest in the timeline, given its direct references to the events of Final Fantasy Tactics. Matsuno has said that he never intended Vagrant Story to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> world as Tactics and Final Fantasy XII, though he noted that Square Enix advertising might not agree.|$|E

25|$|Kiai {{is also a}} {{term used}} in Japanese martial arts, usually as a name for a loud yell {{accompanying}} an attack. Obviously this is outwardly more restrained {{in the context of}} a board game, but it is intended to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> spirit.|$|E

25|$|Plant {{scientists}} have grouped fruits into three main groups, simple fruits, aggregate fruits, and composite or multiple fruits. The groupings are not evolutionarily relevant, since many diverse plant taxa may <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> group, but reflect how the flower organs are arranged {{and how the}} fruits develop.|$|E
25|$|Bodies {{are divided}} into two groups; for some are living and others are devoid of life.

25|$|The {{consequence}} of the Pauli principle here is that electrons of the same spin are kept apart by a repulsive exchange interaction, which is a short-range effect, acting simultaneously with the long-range electrostatic or Coulombic force.

25|$|The sumo wrestler and cavalry have double-move with double-capture abilities, {{similar to}} the 'lion move' in chu shogi. Unlike the lion, they are merely double-move pieces {{and do not have}} the ability to bypass a {{friendly}} piece occupying the first landing point. Unless stated otherwise below, the multiple moves do not need to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> direction and need not all be taken. A second or later move may return a piece to its starting location.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} a delay before the first innings starts, so that the numbers of overs in the two innings are reduced (but still the same as each other), then D/L will make no change to the target score. This is because both sides will <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{position}} of having {{the same number of}} overs and 10 wickets available, and they will know this throughout their innings, thus having the same amount of resource available.|$|E
