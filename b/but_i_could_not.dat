The ship's carpenter, John Seetterly, observed {{that she was}} [...] "very leaky – makes from twelve to sixinches an hour, occasioned by her main keel being wounded in many places, false keel gone from beyond the [...] Wounded on her [...] side where the greatest leak is <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> come at it for the water."

500|$|From 1842 Bennett {{had been}} a {{director}} of the Philharmonic Society of London. He helped to relieve the society's perilous finances by persuading Mendelssohn and Spohr to perform with the Society's orchestra, attracting full houses and much-needed income. In 1842 the orchestra, under the composer's baton, gave the London premiere of Mendelssohn's Third (Scottish) Symphony, two months after its world premiere in Leipzig. In 1844 Mendelssohn conducted the last six concerts of the society's season, in which among his own works and those of many others he included music by Bennett. From 1846 to 1854 the Society's conductor was Michael Costa, of whom Bennett disapproved; Costa was too devoted to Italian opera and not a partisan of the German masters, as was Bennett. Bennett wrote to Mendelssohn on 24 July, displaying some querulousness, [...] "The Philharmonic Directors have engaged Costa... with which I am not very well pleased, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> persuade them to the contrary, and am tired of quarrelling with them. They are a worse set this year than we have ever had." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1848 to 1864, Denmark and the German Confederation {{fought over}} control of the two duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Historically, the duchies had been ruled by Denmark since medieval times, but there {{remained}} a large German majority. This majority was sparked to rebellion after Frederick VII of Denmark announced on 27 March 1848 the duchies would {{become an integral part of}} Denmark under his new liberal constitution. Prussia soon became involved, supporting the uprising and beginning the First Schleswig War. Ernest sent 8,000 men initially, adding to the army sent by the German Confederation. He also desired to be given a military job during the war, but was refused, as it was [...] "extremely difficult to offer me a position in the army of Schleswig-Holstein corresponding to my rank", according to his memoirs. He agreed to a smaller command, coming to lead a Thuringian contingent; he commented in a letter to his brother that [...] "I should have declined any other command of the kind, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> refuse this one, as, in the present condition of our States, it is important to keep the executive power in our hands". As commander of a German corps, Ernest was instrumental in winning the 5 April 1849 battle of Eckernförde against Danish forces.|$|E

2500|$|Forcing the regent, Maria Cristina, {{into exile}} for her {{conspiracy}} with the moderates, Espartero himself became regent {{with the intention}} of remaining so until the future Queen Isabella II became of age. Espartero's popularity enabled him to defeat moderate military rebellions across Spain during 1841. Yet his ruthless execution of dozens of the conspirators, including many popular fellow war heroes like Diego de Leon, as well as his hasty and ungrateful dissolution of the radical [...] that had ended the rebellions, decreased the popularity of his regency. (Maria Cristina told him, [...] "I made you a duke, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> make you a gentleman.") ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Chinese Cafe", {{from the}} 1982 album Wild Things Run Fast, Mitchell sang, [...] "Your kids {{are coming up}} {{straight}} / My child's a stranger / I bore her / <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> raise her." [...] These lyrics did not receive wide attention at the time. The existence of Mitchell's daughter was not publicly known until 1993, when a roommate from Mitchell's art-school days in the 1960s sold {{the story of the}} adoption to a tabloid magazine. By that time, Mitchell's daughter, renamed Kilauren Gibb, had already begun a search for her biological parents. Mitchell and her daughter met in 1997. After the reunion, Mitchell said that she lost interest in songwriting, and she later identified her daughter's birth and her inability {{to take care of her}} as the moment when her songwriting inspiration had really begun. When she could not express herself to the person she wanted to talk to, she became attuned to the whole world and she began to write personally.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2005, {{representatives of}} Juventus met with Arsenal {{with a view}} to signing Vieira. The player, {{according}} to The Guardian, accepted that Arsenal were [...] "ready to let him go" [...] before agreeing in principle to join Juventus. On 15 August 2005, Vieira signed a five-year contract, in a deal worth £13.75 million. In a later interview with the Daily Mail, Wenger explained the departure of Vieira was to serve Cesc Fàbregas' career: [...] "When Cesc Fàbregas was 18, 19, I would play him in a 4–4–2 with Patrick Vieira and I saw it did not work. Then I had the decision to make about letting Patrick go, because Gilberto Silva and Vieira worked, Fàbregas and Silva worked, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> play Fàbregas and Vieira. But Fàbregas was 19 and if he did not play I knew he would want to go, so we risked destroying everything, all the work we had put into this player." ...|$|E
2500|$|Molotov and Hitler {{resumed their}} discussions the next morning. [...] Molotov {{demanded to know}} why German troops were occupying Finland, while Hitler replied that they were {{traveling}} through Finland to Norway and wondered whether the Soviets intended {{to go to war}} over Finland. While Hitler agreed that Finland was within the Soviets' sphere of influence, he also stressed that Germany had a legitimate wartime interest in Finland's nickel and wood supply and that any new conflict in the Baltics would lead to a severe strain in relations. [...] Molotov concluded that nothing good could come from further talks about Finland and stated that he saw no signs of any resumption of a Soviet-Finland conflict. According to Hitler, however, Molotov stated that [...] "Russia felt herself again endangered by Finland, Russia should be able to liquidate Finland" [...] which for him [...] "was the first question which I found difficult to answer. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> do otherwise than refuse this".|$|E
