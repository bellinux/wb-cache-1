6000|$|These {{people are}} rich, and not easily tempted to hard work. During the French émigration, the {{district}} of Banza Nokki drove slaves {{to the value of}} 60,000 dollars per annum, and the dollar is to the African the pound sterling of Europe. It is one of the hundred out-stations which supplied the main dépôts, Boma and Porto da Lenha. Small parties went out at certain seasons provided with rum, gunpowder, and a little cloth; and either bought the [...] "chattels" [...] or paid earnest money, promising to settle the whole debt at their villages. Gidi Mavunga, like most of the elders, was perfectly acquainted with the routes to Nsundi, S. Salvador, and other frontier places, where the <b>bush</b> <b>people</b> brought down their criminals and captives for barter. Beyond those points his information was all from hearsay.|$|E

60|$|The other {{extensive}} landlord is Mr. John Morton, a young man, who, {{in spite}} of his position as squire of Bragton, owner of Bragton Park, and landlord of the entire parishes of Bragton and Mallingham,--the latter of which comes close up to the confines of Dillsborough,--was at the time at which our story begins, Secretary of Legation at Washington. As he had been an absentee since he came of age,--soon after which time he inherited the property,--he had been almost less liked in the neighbourhood than the lord. Indeed, no one in Dillsborough knew much about him, although Bragton Hall was but four miles from the town, and the Mortons had possessed the property and lived on it for the last three centuries. But there had been extravagance, as will hereafter have to be told, and there had been no continuous residence at Bragton since the death of old Reginald Morton, who had been the best known and the best loved of all the squires in Rufford, and had for many years been master of the Rufford hounds. He had lived to a very great age, and, though the great-grandfather of the present man, had not been dead above twenty years. He was the man of whom the older inhabitants of Dillsborough and the neighbourhood still thought and still spoke when they gave vent to their feelings in favour of gentlemen. And yet the old squire in his latter days had been able to do little or nothing for them,--being sometimes backward as to the payment of money he owed among them. But he had lived all his days at Bragton Park, and his figure had been familiar to all eyes in the High Street of Dillsborough and at the front entrance of the <b>Bush.</b> <b>People</b> still spoke of old Mr. Reginald Morton as though his death had been a sore loss to the neighbourhood.|$|E

50|$|The prime {{creative}} {{force behind}} the company was Alfred Rolfe, who had extensive stage experience. According to film historians Graham Shirley and Brian Adams:The conventions of spectacle melodrama so favourited in late nineteenth century Australian theatre, with their realistic settings and real chases on horseback and train wrecks, played {{a large role in}} the films he made the company... They were conventions in which his late father-in-law, Alfred Dampier had excelled in his stage productions... The Australian Photo-Play formula was a string of sensational incidents climaxed by a chase, with actuality footage sometimes cunningly incorporated... Nearly all the APP films made use of popular conceptions of the <b>bush,</b> <b>peopling</b> their stories with marauding Aboriginals, vengeful settlers, English outcasts and shamed women. Revenge melodramas were the staple.Many of the films were based on plays that were popular in Australia at the time. In particular several had been performed by Philip Lytton prior to filming.|$|R

5000|$|Moses' poems were {{considered}} by Gundagai Shire Council {{to be of}} extreme significance as they immortalised the historic Australian town of Gundagai and influenced the famous Australian iconic monument, the Dog on the Tuckerbox, five miles from Gundagai, to come into being.
