50|$|Many speculations {{were made}} {{with regard to the}} control {{mechanisms}} employed by a cell to promote the irreversibility of mitotic exit in a eukaryotic model organism, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Proteolytic degradation of cell cycle regulators and corresponding effects on the levels of cyclin-dependent kinases were proposed as a mechanism that promotes eukaryotic cell cycle and metaphase-to-anaphase transition in particular. In this theory, anaphase promoting complex (APC), a class of ubiquitin ligase, facilitates degradation of mitotic cyclins (Clb2) and anaphase-inhibiting factors (PDS1, CUT2) to promote mitotic exit. APC ubiquitinates nine-amino acid motif known as the destruction <b>box</b> (<b>D</b> box) in the NH2-terminal domain of mitotic cyclins for degradation by proteasome. APC in association with Cdc20 (APC-Cdc20) ubiquitinates and targets mitotic cyclins (Clb2) for degradation at initial phase. Simultaneously, APC-Cdc20 mediates degradation of securins, which inhibit separases through binding, at anaphase onset. Released and active separase cleaves cohesin that held sister chromatids together, facilitating separation of sister chromatids and initiates mitotic exit by promoting release of Cdc14 from nucleolus. At later phase, downregulation of Cdk1 and activation of Cdc14, a Cdh1-activating phosphatase, promotes formation of APC in association with Cdh1 (APC-Cdh1) to degrade Clb2s. Cdc20 and Cdh1, which are the activators of APC, recruit substrates such as securin and B-type cyclins(Clb) for ubiquitination. Without Cdk1-Clb2 complexes to phosphorylate proteins that are involved in spindle dynamics such as Sli15, Ase1, and Ask1, spindle elongation and chromosomal segregation are promoted, facilitating mitotic exit. The importance of proteolytic degradation in eukaryotic cell cycle changed the view of cell division as a simple kinase cascade to a more complex process in which interactions among phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteolysis are necessary. However, experiments using budding yeast cells with cdc28-as1, a INM-PP1 (ATP analog)-sensitive Cdk allele, proved that destruction of B-type cyclins (Clb) is not necessary for triggering irreversible mitotic exit. Clb2 degradation did shorten the Cdk1-inhibition period required for triggering irreversible mitotic exit indicating that cyclin proteolysis contributes to the dynamic nature of the eukaryotic cell cycle due to slower timescale of its action but is unlikely to be the major determining factor in triggering irreversible cell cycle transitions.|$|E

Novel aspects of the VZV OriS include a GA-rich region, three binding sites for the VZV origin-binding protein (OBP) all on the same strand and oriented in the same direction, and a partial OBP binding site of unknown function. We have designated this partial binding site <b>Box</b> <b>D</b> and have investigated the role it plays in DNA replication and flanking gene expression. This has been done with a model system using a replication-competent plasmid containing OriS and a replication- and transcription-competent dual-luciferase reporter plasmid containing both the OriS and the intergenic region between VZV open reading frames (ORFs) 62 and 63. We have found that (i) <b>Box</b> <b>D</b> is a negative regulator of DNA replication independent of flanking gene expression, (ii) the mutation of <b>Box</b> <b>D</b> results in a decrease in flanking gene expression, thus a sequence within the VZV OriS affects transcription, which is in contrast to results reported for HSV- 1, (iii) there is a specific <b>Box</b> <b>D</b> complex formed with infected cell extracts in electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments, (iv) supershift assays show that this complex contains the VZV ORF 29 single-strand DNA-binding protein, and (v) the formation of this complex is dependent on the presence of CGC motifs in <b>Box</b> <b>D</b> and its downstream flanking region.

Here we have performed a mutational analysis of U 3 and U 14 to determine the cis-acting sequences required for 5 ′-cap hypermethylation of Box C/D snoRNAs.

Depletion of U 14 results in impaired processing of pre-rRNA, deficiency in 18 S-containing intermediates and marked under-accumulation of mature 18 S RNA. The present report describes results of functional mapping of U 14, {{by a variety of}} mutagenic approaches. Special attention was directed at assessing the importance of sequence elements conserved between yeast and mouse U 14 as well as other snoRNA species. Functionality was assessed in a test strain containing a galactose dependent U 14 gene. The results show portions of three U 14 conserved regions to be required for U 14 accumulation or function. These regions include bases in: (i) the 5 '-proximal box C region, (ii) the 3 '-distal <b>box</b> <b>D</b> region, and (iii) a 13 base domain complementary to 18 S rRNA. Point and multi-base substitution mutations in the snoRNA conserved box C and <b>box</b> <b>D</b> regions prevent U 14 accumulation. Mutations in the essential 18 S related domain do not effect U 14 levels, but do disrupt synthesis of 18 S RNA, indicating that this region is required for function.

Insight into the behavior of signal peptidase has come from the recent description of the crystal structure of the ectodomain of the Escherichia coli enzyme (Paetzel et al. 1998). In E. coli, signal peptidase is composed of two structural components, referred to as domain I and do-main II. Corresponding to the “catalytic core ” of the enzyme, domain I encompasses boxes A–E, five regions of significant sequence homology preserved throughout evolution (Fig. 1). Box B contains the nucleophilic Ser 90 residue (E. coli numbering) and the conserved Met 91 residue, while <b>box</b> <b>D</b> contains the proposed general base Lys 145 and the conserved Arg 146.

40|$|U 14 is one {{of several}} {{nucleolar}} small nuclear RNAs required for normal processing of rRNA. Functional mapping of U 14 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has yielded a number of mutants defective in U 14 accumulation or function. In this study, we have further defined three structural elements required for U 14 accumulation. The essential elements include the U 14 -conserved box C and <b>box</b> <b>D</b> sequences and a 5 ', 3 ' terminal stem. The box elements are coconserved among several nucleolar small nuclear RNAs and have been implicated in binding of the protein fibrillarin.

An intragenic suppressor of a lethal box C mutant has been isolated and shown to contain a new box C-like PyGAUG sequence two bases upstream of normal box C. The importance of the terminal stem was confirmed from new compensatory base changes and the finding that accumulation defects in the box elements can be complemented by extending the terminal stem.

We have investigated the involvement of cis-acting sequences and intranuclear structures in the localization of box C/D snoRNAs to the nucleolus by assaying the intranuclear distribution of fluorescently labeled U 3, U 8, and U 14 snoRNAs injected into Xenopus oocyte nuclei. Analysis of an extensive panel of U 3 RNA variants showed that the box C/D motif, comprised of box C�, <b>box</b> <b>D,</b> and the 3 � terminal stem of U 3, is necessary and sufficient for the nucleolar localization of U 3 snoRNA.
