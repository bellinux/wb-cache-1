50|$|Bucket chain {{excavators}} {{are heavy}} equipment used in surface mining and dredging. It uses buckets on a revolving chain to remove {{large quantities of}} material. It has similar characteristics to <b>bucket-wheel</b> <b>excavators</b> and trenchers.

5000|$|A large {{conveyor}} bridge with 200 m span and 50 m height, fed by a <b>bucket-wheel</b> <b>excavator,</b> {{was completed in}} 1930 in the Böhlen lignite mine. After it was toppled by a storm in 1937, a replacement went into service in 1939.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{function}} of BWEs is {{to act as}} a continuous digging machine in large-scale open-pit mining operations. What sets BWEs apart from other large-scale mining equipment, such as bucket chain excavators, is their use of a large wheel consisting of a continuous pattern of buckets used to scoop material as the wheel turns. They are among the largest vehicles ever constructed, and the biggest <b>bucket-wheel</b> <b>excavator</b> ever built, Bagger 293, is the largest terrestrial (land) vehicle in human history by weight (14,200 tonnes), according to the Guinness Book of World Records.|$|E

50|$|The Merkers Mine drops 860m {{below the}} surface into the 'Werra-Revier' band of potash bearing salt. There, at a {{constant}} temperature of 28C, are 4600 kilometers of tunnels. Visitors are lowered in the hoisting cage at over 10m/ sec (30 km/h) down to the 500m galleries. There they are driven on 20-kilometre long tour of the mine, seeing an underground mining museum, a room where in 1945 the 'Gold und Devisenreserven der Deutschen Reichbank' dubbed the Nazi gold was stored, the worlds largest underground <b>bucket-wheel</b> <b>excavator,</b> simulated blasting and a laser show in the world's largest underground concert hall. Also, in 1980 a crystal grotto was discovered. Here visitors see enormous salt crystals, some over 1000mm in length.|$|E
50|$|Bagger 288 (Excavator 288), {{built by}} the German company Krupp for the energy and mining firm Rheinbraun, is a <b>bucket-wheel</b> <b>excavator</b> or mobile strip mining machine.When its {{construction}} was completed in 1978, Bagger 288 superseded Big Muskie as the heaviest land vehicle in the world, at 13,500 tons. It took five years to design and manufacture, and five years to assemble with total cost reaching $100 million. In 1995, it was itself superseded by the slightly heavier Bagger 293 (14,200 tons). NASA's Crawler-Transporter still remains the largest self-powered land vehicle in the world, since bucket-wheel excavators are powered by an external power source, and the Overburden Conveyor Bridge F60s hold the title of largest land vehicle of any type by physical dimensions.|$|E

Upon its construction, the crawler-transporter became the largest self-powered land vehicle in the world.

50|$|<b>Bucket-wheel</b> <b>excavators</b> {{have been}} used in mining for the past century, with some of the first being {{manufactured}} in the 1920s. They are used in conjunction with many other pieces of mining machinery (conveyor belts, spreaders, crushing stations, heap-leach systems, etc.) to move and mine massive amounts of overburden (waste). While the overall concepts that go into a BWE have not changed much, their size has grown drastically since the end of World War II.|$|R

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper The paper reviews simplified equivalent torsional {{models as}} an efficient approach to modelling and simulating dynamic behaviour of {{electric motor driven}} mechanisms. The focus is put on preliminary design phase. Motion of the masses is described by a system of second-order non-homogeneous differential equations. The solution yields the law of motion {{as well as the}} torque function in the elastic bonds between the masses. Special attention is dedicated to accurate modelling of electric motor characteristics and resistant forces acting on executive parts of drive mechanisms. Stochastic nature of resistant forces is also considered. The aim is to demonstrate that the combination of a simplified model with an accurate description of drive and load torques produces satisfactory results, which are, therefore, useful in furthering the design process. Two examples involving drive mechanisms of a crane and a <b>bucket-wheel</b> <b>excavator</b> illustrate the approach...|$|E
40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper This paper {{identifies the}} rubber belt conveyers ’ reliability function, operating on machines (<b>bucket-wheel</b> <b>excavator,</b> beltwagon, spreader) removing overburden on the Tamnava – East Field Open Cast Mine, {{depending on the}} belt length and operating time. The proposed methodology used to analyse operating time until failure is the basis to identify the reliability function. The methodology {{is based on the}} fact that belt operating time until failure may be represented by the composition of exponential distribution (sudden failures) and normal distribution (gradual failure), as well as on the fact that there is linear dependence between the belt length and the mean operating time until gradual failures. The proposed methodology and reliability function may be applied to analyse operation of other open cast mines, with certain adjustments, to provide better downtime planning, spare rubber belts planning, as well as to reduce open cast mine operating costs, i. e. optimal maintenance strategy...|$|E
50|$|At the Spandau factory, O&K built {{cable-operated}} <b>excavators</b> and <b>bucket-wheel</b> <b>excavators</b> {{for use in}} the lignite {{coal mines}} of eastern Germany. Under the Aryanisation scheme of Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany, the Orenstein family's shares in the company were forcibly sold in 1935; Orenstein and Koppel was placed under trust administration, and the Babelsberger works were taken over and renamed in 1941. O&K existed in name only, but more commonly used the abbreviation MBA (Maschienenbau und Bahnbedarf AG).|$|R
50|$|TAKRAF is {{a global}} German {{industrial}} company based in Leipzig.

5000|$|... "Strip mining" [...] is the {{practice}} of mining a seam of mineral, by first removing a long strip of overlying soil and rock (the overburden). It is most commonly used to mine coal and lignite (brown coal). Strip mining is only practical when the ore body to be excavated is relatively near the surface. This type of mining uses {{some of the largest}} machines on earth, including <b>bucket-wheel</b> <b>excavators</b> which can move as much as 12,000 cubic meters of earth per hour.|$|R
