25|$|One of the Lego Group's most {{successful}} series, the Lego train system, {{was released in}} 1966. The original train sets included a 4.5-volt motor, <b>battery</b> <b>box</b> and rails; two years later, a 12-volt motor was introduced.|$|E
25|$|It had a {{rear area}} {{where it could}} carry {{ammunition}}, since {{it could be used}} in ammunition dumps to carry ammunition around the dump. The M6 also was equipped with a winterization kit that included: an insulated <b>battery</b> <b>box</b> with a heating coil, a gasoline heater to heat the battery, and a petcock for the bottom of the fuel tank (for easy releasing of cold air and pressure from the gasoline tank).|$|E

2500|$|There {{is another}} version of the model J known as the Duesenberg JN (a name never used by the company either). All JNs were sold with Rollston {{coachwork}} and only ten were produced in 1935. In an attempt to give a more modern look to an ageing design, the JN was equipped with smaller -diameter wheels (versus [...] ), skirted fenders, bullet-shaped taillights, and bodies set on the frame rails for a lower look. The <b>battery</b> <b>box</b> and tool box were redesigned slightly so that the doors could close over the frame. Supercharged JNs gained the logical SJN designation.|$|E
2500|$|Former Conrail {{locomotives}} can {{be spotted}} by recognizing phase differences in engine models and numbering. Other spotting details can be inconsistent, but can include {{a number of}} the following: red marker lights, Leslie model RS3L or RS5T air horns (only a few original horns remain. Many have been replaced by K5LAs), former Conrail SD40-2s ride on Flexicoil [...] "C" [...] trucks and have anti-climbers, ditch lights mounted beneath the anti-climber, headlights above the cab (vs. CSX's standard practice of nose mounted headlights on all wide-nose GE units), and modified [...] "Bright Future" [...] paint with <b>battery</b> <b>box</b> faces painted yellow (instead of black or blue).|$|E
2500|$|Sherwood's hard luck, unfortunately, did {{not stop}} there, and he was plagued with a {{frustrating}} amount of mechanical problems. For starters, he loses his <b>battery</b> <b>box</b> and batteries (resulting in two days lost while a replacement box is fabricated on the spot), suffers a flat tire, and then experiences problems with his truck’s on-board computer that forces him to abandon a load on the roadside. Sherwood ends up driving the truck of expelled driver Todd White just {{to pick up where}} he left off, yet ends up suffering through problems in that truck, as well (as seen in episode 7). [...] Hugh Rowland, the truck's owner, and Lee Parkinson, Rowland's mechanic, blamed many of these mechanical problems squarely on Sherwood. Sherwood ultimately decides enough is enough and leaves the ice roads to return home.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{the diesel}} {{locomotives}} built with Rolls-Royce engines shared many design features – rounded engine covers (bonnets) narrow enough to permit walkways {{to be put}} down each side; four cab windows overlooking the engine; fuel tanks and/or <b>battery</b> <b>boxes</b> built into the running boards; walkways or balconies at each end; access to the cab from a walkway or balcony.|$|R

50|$|Weathering {{purchased}} {{models is}} common. At the least, weathering aims {{to reduce the}} plastic-like finish of scale models. The simulation of grime, rust, dirt, and wear adds realism. Some modellers simulate fuel stains on tanks, or corrosion on <b>battery</b> <b>boxes.</b> In some cases, evidence of accidents or repairs may be added, such as dents or freshly painted replacement parts, and weathered models can be nearly indistinguishable from their prototypes when photographed appropriately.|$|R

50|$|This {{conversion}} significantly {{alters the}} external {{appearance of the}} locomotive, with the cab (which is actually brand new) being moved forward on the frame {{to make room for}} a large louvered <b>battery</b> <b>box,</b> which takes the place of the locomotive's long hood. The fuel tank is similarly replaced with another <b>battery</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
50|$|Also {{there are}} some accessories, like foudation cage and <b>battery</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since huge {{voltage drops}} are often {{encountered}} between electric sub-stations, the locomotive {{was designed to}} be able to operate on a supply varying between 55 and 25 kV AC. The <b>battery</b> <b>boxes</b> and the main air reservoirs are mounted between the bogies beneath the frame, where a compartment houses a small motor scooter for use by the crew for lineside inspections of the train, which can be up to nearly 4 km long.|$|R

50|$|The later Comuta-Car, {{produced}} by Commuter Vehicles, Inc. retained {{all of the}} Transitional CitiCar changes including the larger 6 HP motor and drive train arrangement, but moved the batteries from under the seat to <b>battery</b> <b>boxes</b> behind the bumpers, making the vehicle about 16 in longer than the 8 ft long CitiCar. ComutaCars also incorporated additional frame supports to meet the new DOT standards. One of these supports created the center console like rug covered divider between the driver and passenger.|$|R

5000|$|In 1915, Kahler {{used his}} {{experience}} gained from manufacturing and assembling automobiles {{to become one}} of eight prime wooden component suppliers to the Ford Motor Company of Detroit, Michigan.

A serial number preceded by the lhe letters [...] "KA" [...] stamped on a Ford Model T's firewall or front frame member indicates the frame assembly was manufactured at The Kahler Co.'s New Albany factory.

50|$|Limiter fuses {{consist of}} a metal strip from a lock plate, for {{currents}} over 40 amperes. Frequently, these are used {{in close proximity to}} starter <b>battery</b> fuse <b>boxes.</b> They are used also in electric vehicles, e.g., in forklift trucks.

5000|$|Due to a {{locomotive}} shortage {{because of the}} planned replacement of AN Tasrails English Electric locomotive fleet, twelve DQs and three QRs were sold to the company. DQs 6007, 6330, 6353 and QR 3032, along with eight 1460 class locomotives, were sold to Tasrail. The three DQs were modified for service in Tasmania, while QR 3032 had its short-hood lowered as a DQ. The eight 1460s were fully rebuilt as DQs, with some being undergoing rebuilding when they were sold. Originally the three QRs were on a one year lease, but were later sold. The modifications made to the units were changing the drawgear back to the originally Queensland Railways standard height, increasing the fuel tank capacity, relocate the <b>battery</b> <b>boxes,</b> installation of a sludge tank and engine room sump pan, fitting of the [...] "Kaitiaki" [...] vigilance, fitting of ZTR electronic anti-wheelslip technology and upgrading dynamic brakes. The locos were also were renumbered in the 2000 series, and tested between Wellington and Palmerston North.|$|R
