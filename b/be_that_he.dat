5|$|Nothing more {{is known}} of Michael Bourtzes after that, and it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died {{sometime}} around the autumn of 995. He did, however, have at least three sons, Michael, Theognostos, and Samuel, known because they conspired against Constantine VIII after he blinded Michael's son, named Constantine, in 1025/26.|$|E
5|$|Eowa {{was killed}} at Maserfield along with Oswald, {{although}} on which side he fought is unknown. It may well <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> fought as a dependent ally of Oswald against Penda. If Eowa {{was in fact}} dominant among the Mercians during the period {{leading up to the}} battle, then his death could have marked what the author of the Historia Brittonum regarded as the beginning of Penda's ten-year reign. Thus it may be that Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over his rivals among the Mercians.|$|E
5|$|Her uncle Ásmundr {{probably}} {{died in the}} Battle of Fýrisvellir, in the 980s, and it {{was probably}} {{at the side of}} king Eric the Victorious. Özurr had entered into the service of a more powerful liege and died for the Byzantine Emperor. Halfdan may have died either on Bornholm or in a holmgang, whereas where Kári died remains uncertain. The most likely interpretation may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died on Od, the old name for the north-western cape of Zealand, but {{it is also possible that}} it was at Dundee in Scotland. Búi's location of death is not given, but Larsson (2002) comments that it was probably in a way that was not considered as glorious as those of his brothers.|$|E
50|$|Three main {{theories}} exist {{about what}} happened: One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> got lost and perished somehow, likely {{during the first}} night. Another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> attacked by a hungry bear and carried off. The last <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> abducted and {{taken out of the}} park by a human. His father is a proponent of the third theory.|$|R
50|$|At times, Berry offered two {{different}} explanations for his actions. One <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> killed Mitroff for revenge for almost running over Berry's sister with the delivery van, {{while the other}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> killed him for no special reason.|$|R
50|$|The {{circumstances}} of Nishi's death are unknown {{and subject to}} competing theories. One theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{found himself in the}} midst of enemy forces on the morning of March 21 and was killed by machine gun fire while moving to the regimental headquarters. Another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and his aide killed themselves with their pistols near Ginmyōsui or Futagoiwa. Yet another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> burnt to death by American flamethrowers on March 22, or <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and several subordinates carried out a final assault and were killed in action.|$|R
5|$|The {{extremely}} nested pseudonymity of {{this work}} adds a problem of interpretation. A and B are {{the authors of the}} work, Eremita is the editor. Kierkegaard's role in all this appears to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> deliberately sought to disconnect himself from the points of view expressed in his works, although the absurdity of his pseudonyms' bizarre Latin names proves that he did not hope to thoroughly conceal his identity from the reader. Kierkegaard's Papers first edition VIII(2), B 81 - 89 explain this method in writing. On interpretation there is also much to be found in The Point of View of My Work as an Author.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Æthelburg's {{marriage}} being dependent on Edwin {{allowing her to}} practice her faith has been questioned, since revising the chronology makes it likely, though not certain, that the marriage was arranged before Eadbald's conversion. In this view, {{it would have been}} the church that objected to the marriage, and Æthelburg would have been Christian before Eadbald's conversion. The story of Paulinus's consecration is also problematic as he was not consecrated until at least 625 and possibly later, which is after the latest possible date for Æthelburg's marriage. However, it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> traveled to Northumbria prior to his consecration and only later became bishop.|$|E
5|$|When {{a player}} is {{found by the}} umpire to have {{delivered}} the ball contrary to those rules, the umpire will call a no ball and {{he is said to}} have been called for throwing. Where public opinion is that a player's bowling action appears to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> routinely throws, he is said to have a 'suspect' or an 'illegal' action, or more derogatorily, is said to be a 'chucker'. The issue is often highly emotive with accusers considering that deliveries with an illegal action are akin to cheating.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see. But {{there are}} all the same," [...] she went on, [...] "two quite {{distinct}} things that--given the wonderful place he's in--may have happened to him.

60|$|There are {{two main}} moral necessities {{for the work of}} a great man: the first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should believe in the truth of his message; the second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should believe in the {{acceptability}} of his message. It was the whole tragedy of Carlyle <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had the first and not the second.|$|R

5|$|Cædwalla was unbaptised {{when he came}} to {{the throne}} of Wessex, and {{remained}} so throughout his reign, but though he is often referred to as a pagan this is not necessarily the most apt description; it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was already Christian in his beliefs but delayed his baptism to a time of his choice. He was clearly respectful of the church, with charter evidence showing multiple grants to churches and for religious buildings. When Cædwalla first attacked the South Saxons, Wilfrid was at the court of King Æthelwealh, and on Æthelwealh's death Wilfrid attached himself to Cædwalla; the Life of Wilfrid records that Cædwalla sought Wilfrid out as a spiritual father. Bede states that Cædwalla vowed to give a quarter of the Isle of Wight to the church if he conquered the island, and that Wilfrid was the beneficiary when the vow was fulfilled; Bede also says that Cædwalla agreed to let the heirs of Arwald, the king of the Isle of Wight, be baptised before they were executed. Two of Cædwalla's charters were grants of land to Wilfrid, and there is also subsequent evidence that Cædwalla worked with Wilfrid and Eorcenwald, a bishop of the East Saxons, to establish an ecclesiastical infrastructure for Sussex. However, there is no evidence that Wilfrid exerted any influence over Cædwalla's secular activities or his campaigns.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} for cult being paid to Bede in England in the 8th century. One reason for this may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died on the feast day of Augustine of Canterbury. Later, when he was venerated in England, he was either commemorated after Augustine on 26 May, or his feast was moved to 27 May. However, he was venerated outside England, mainly {{through the efforts of}} Boniface and Alcuin, both of whom promoted the cult on the Continent. Boniface wrote repeatedly back to England during his missionary efforts, requesting copies of Bede's theological works. Alcuin, who was taught at the school set up in York by Bede's pupil Egbert, praised Bede as an example for monks to follow and was instrumental in disseminating Bede's works to all of Alcuin's friends. Bede's cult became prominent in England during the 10th-century revival of monasticism, and by the 14th century had spread to many of the cathedrals of England. Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester (c. 1008–1095) was a particular devotee of Bede's, dedicating a church to him in 1062, which was Wulfstan's first undertaking after his consecration as bishop.|$|E

25|$|Although {{apparently}} the legitimate heir to Moray, Domnall {{did not receive}} {{the rule of the}} province from David on his father's death. The suggested reason is that Domnall would have been a child, and no suitable ruler for such a fractious and distant province. Domnall does not certainly appear in the record of events until the late 1170s, although it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should be linked to disorders in Moray in the 1160s in the reign of Malcolm IV.|$|E
25|$|Fitzwalter was {{implicated in}} the baronial {{conspiracy}} of 1212. According to his own statement the king had attempted to seduce his eldest daughter, but Robert's account of his grievances varied from time to time. The truth seems to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was irritated by the suspicion with which John regarded the new baronage. Fitzwalter escaped a trial by fleeing to France. He was outlawed, but returned under a special amnesty after John's reconciliation with the pope.|$|E
25|$|Bruyerinus Champier was {{the nephew}} of Symphorien Champier, and {{physician}} of Henry II of France. He was an Arabist, and translated works of Avicena. In 1550 he published his first Materia Medica, printed by Balthazar Arnoullet in Lyons. This work had a second edition in 1552 printed by Arnoullet in Lyon and Vienne. Both works were illustrated with figures by Fuchs, but in this last edition there were also 30 woodcuts by the botanist and physician Jacob Dalechamp. It seems that the reason that he used his initials, H.B.P., and not his full name in the work; it could <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> practically transcribed commentaries of Mattioli.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a {{doubt about}} it, I'm told. The queer thing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should have {{declared}} his purpose beforehand to Erle. Gresham {{says that all}} <b>that</b> must have <b>been</b> part of his plan,--so as to make men think afterwards <b>that</b> <b>he</b> couldn't have done it. Grogram's idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had planned the murder {{before he went to}} the club." ...|$|R
50|$|Mori gives several reasons, {{in various}} interviews, {{as to why}} he started to write while working as {{associate}} professor. One of the reasons <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> saying jokingly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would become a writer by forty, and another, already mentioned above, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted to have another source of income for his hobbies. However, the direct cause <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Mori simply wanted to impress his daughter who was a big fan of mystery novels.|$|R
5000|$|As of 2005, it <b>was</b> {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a practising Shinto priest at {{a shrine}} on Shikoku. [...] However, an alternative theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never became a Shinto priest, instead becoming {{the head of}} the Hokkaido branch of Seicho no Ie and was renamed Hiroyasu Arechi. It <b>is</b> further posited <b>that</b> <b>he</b> now resides in Kumamoto.|$|R
25|$|The {{other major}} work that Jonson wrote about Boulstred was his “Epitaph on Cecilia Bulstrode,” written in {{response}} to her death. This poem paints a very different picture of Boulstred than that of his epigram. In fact, it seems to retract each of the charges made in the first point by point. Jonson calls her a virgin, teacher to Pallas and Cynthia, conscientious, and good, vastly different from his epigram. The reason behind Jonson’s supposed change of heart is unknown. The likely reason is {{that he wanted to}} gain the favor of Lucy Russell, which he had been attempting to do for years. However, another explanation could <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> experienced true regret for his slanderous words after hearing of her painful death.|$|E
25|$|There are {{legends of}} him (Khidr) in which, like Osiris, he is dismembered and reborn; and prophecies {{connecting}} him, like the Green Man, {{with the end}} of time. His name means the Green One or Verdant One, he is the voice of inspiration to the aspirant and committed artist. He can come as a white light or the gleam on a blade of grass, but more often as an inner mood. The sign of his presence is the ability to work or experience with tireless enthusiasm beyond one's normal capacities. In this there may be a link across cultures, …one reason for the enthusiasm of the medieval sculptors for the Green Man may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the source of every inspiration.|$|E
25|$|In 1969 a Satanic {{group based}} in Toledo, Ohio, part of the United States, came to public attention. Called the Our Lady of Endor Coven, it was led {{by a man named}} Herbert Sloane, who {{described}} his Satanic tradition as the Ophite Cultus Satanas and alleged that it had been established in the 1940s. The group offered a Gnostic interpretation {{of the world in which}} the creator God was regarded as evil and the Biblical Serpent presented as a force for good who had delivered salvation to humanity in the Garden of Eden. Sloane's claims that his group had a 1940s origin remain unproven; it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> falsely claimed older origins for his group to make it appear older than Anton LaVey's Church of Satan which had been established in 1966.|$|E

25|$|Of course, Cnut's {{journey to}} Rome in 1027 is {{another sign of}} his {{dedication}} to the Christian religion. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> went to attend the coronation of Conrad II {{in order to improve}} relations between the two powers, yet he had previously made a vow to seek the favour of St Peter, the keeper of the keys to the heavenly kingdom. While in Rome, Cnut made an agreement with the Pope to reduce the fees paid by the English archbishops to receive their pallium. He also arranged that travellers from his realm not be straightened by unjust tolls and that they should be safeguarded on their way to and from Rome. Some evidence exists for a second journey in 1030.|$|E
25|$|The erasures were {{sporadic}} and haphazard, {{with only}} the more visible and accessible images of Hatshepsut being removed; had it been more complete, we would not now have so many images of Hatshepsut. Thutmose III may have died before these changes were finished and it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never intended a total obliteration of her memory. In fact, {{we have no evidence}} to support the assumption that Thutmose hated or resented Hatshepsut during her lifetime. Had that been true, as head of the army, in a position given to him by Hatshepsut (who was clearly not worried about her co-regent's loyalty), he surely could have led a successful coup, but he made no attempt to challenge her authority during her reign and, her accomplishments and images remained featured on all of the public buildings she built for twenty years after her death.|$|E
25|$|As Chief Justice, Chase also presided at the {{impeachment}} trial of President Andrew Johnson in 1868. As the justice {{responsible for the}} 4th Circuit, Chase also {{would have been one}} of two judges at the trial of Jefferson Davis (who was imprisoned at Fort Monroe in Virginia,) because trial for major crimes such as treason required two judges. However, Davis' best defense would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> forfeited U.S. citizenship upon secession, and therefore could not have committed treason. Convicting Davis could also interfere with Chase's presidential ambitions, described below. After passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868, Chase invited Davis' lawyer to meet with him privately, and explained his theory that Section 3 of the new Amendment prohibited imposing further punishment on former Confederates. When Davis' lawyer repeated this argument in open court, Chase dismissed the case, over the objection of his colleague, U.S. District Judge John Curtiss Underwood, and the government chose not to appeal the dismissal to U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
