5|$|Most {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of AML are caused by the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells. A lack of normal white <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> production makes people more susceptible to infections; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from white <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> precursors, they have no infection-fighting capacity. A drop in red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count (anemia) can cause fatigue, paleness, and shortness of breath. A lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but {{nearly half of the}} time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the {{diagnostic}} utility of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count, electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} malaria is common, {{children}} under {{five years old}} often have anemia which is sometimes due to malaria. Giving children with anemia in these areas preventive antimalarial medication improves red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> levels slightly but {{did not affect the}} risk of death or need for hospitalization.|$|E
25|$|The cancellous part {{of bones}} contain bone marrow. Bone marrow {{produces}} <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> {{in a process}} called hematopoiesis. <b>Blood</b> <b>cells</b> that are created in bone marrow include red <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> platelets and white <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b> Progenitor cells such as the hematopoietic stem cell divide in a process called mitosis to produce precursor cells. These include precursors which eventually give rise to white <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> and erythroblasts which give rise to red <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b> Unlike red and white <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> created by mitosis, platelets are shed from very large cells called megakaryocytes. This process of progressive differentiation occurs within the bone marrow. After the cells are matured, they enter the circulation. Every day, over 2.5 billion red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> and platelets, and 50–100 billion granulocytes are produced in this way.|$|R

50|$|Overdosing {{can reduce}} the number of {{function}} of various kinds of <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> including loss of red <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> methemoglobinemia, and loss of white <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
5|$|It is {{not clear}} why Wilson's disease causes hemolysis, but various lines of {{evidence}} suggest that {{a high level of}} free (non-ceruloplasmin bound) copper has a direct effect on either oxidation of hemoglobin, inhibition of energy-supplying enzymes in the red <b>blood</b> <b>cell,</b> or direct damage to the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E
5|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} {{occurs in}} 1% of people following infections with Campylobacter species, and Guillain–Barré syndrome occurs in 0.1%. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) may occur due to infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli or Shigella species, causing low platelet counts, poor kidney function, and low red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count (due to their breakdown). Children are more predisposed to getting HUS than adults. Some viral infections may produce benign infantile seizures.|$|E

5|$|Routine {{blood tests}} show {{features}} of acute inflammation (raised white <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count and elevated C-reactive protein level), and usually abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). In {{most cases the}} LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble {{assumption is}} that the filtering capacity of the lung has a threshold radius {{of the size of}} a red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> and that sufficiently small decompression bubbles can pass to the arterial side, especially during the initial phase of ascent. Later in the ascent, bubbles grow to a larger size and remain trapped in the lung. This may explain why conventional Doppler measurements have not detected any bubbles in the arterial circulation.|$|E

All were nauseated and vomiting, and two of them were showing leukopenia (low white <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count). Reviewing the cases on 18 February, the doctors realized their symptoms were likely caused by radiation exposure, and notified the OAEP.|$|E
50|$|Sickle cell anemia {{may cause}} brain {{ischemia}} {{associated with the}} irregularly shaped <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b> Sickle shaped <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> clot more easily than normal <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> impeding <b>blood</b> flow to the brain.|$|R

However, the epitopes (conformational epitopes) that are recognized by the B cell prior to their digestion {{may not be the}} same as that presented to the T helper cell. Additionally, a B cell may present different peptides complexed to different MHC-II molecules.|$|E
5|$|Fingolimod {{may give}} rise to {{hypertension}} and slowed heart rate, macular edema, elevated liver enzymes or a reduction in lymphocyte levels. Tentative evidence supports the short-term safety of teriflunomide, with common side effects including: headaches, fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and limb pain. There have also been reports of liver failure and PML with its use and it is dangerous for fetal development. Most common side effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing and gastrointestinal problems. While dimethyl fumarate {{may lead to a}} reduction in the white <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during trials.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{different}} in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with a diameter of about 120nm, around 60times smaller than a red <b>blood</b> <b>cell.</b> It is composed of two copies of positive single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed {{for the development of}} the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.|$|E
40|$|Cryopreserved (frozen) red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> {{have been}} used in {{transfusion}} medicine since the Vietnam war. The main method to freeze the red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> is by usage of glycerol. Although the usage of cryopreserved red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> was promising due to the prolonged storage time and the limited cellular deterioration at subzero temperatures, its usage have been hampered due to the more complex and labour intensive procedure and the limited shelf life of thawed products. Since the FDA approval of a closed (de) glycerolization procedure in 2002, allowing a prolonged postthaw storage of red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> up to 21 days at 2 - 6 degrees C, cryopreserved red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> have become a more utilized blood product. Currently, cryopreserved red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> are mainly used in military operations and to stock red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> with rare phenotypes. Yet, cryopreserved red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> could also be useful to replenish temporary blood shortages, to prolong storage time before autologous transfusion and for IgA-deficient patients. This review describes the main methods to cryopreserve red <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> explores the quality of this blood product and highlights clinical settings in which cryopreserved red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> are or could be utilized...|$|R

50|$|In 1967 Chien {{published}} three {{papers in}} Science that advanced {{the understanding of}} the physics behind the flow of red <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b> Chien and his colleagues were able to explore the flow properties of red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> through various experiments involved with filtering red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> through plastic porous sieves. One key finding was that the flow of red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> does not follow Newtonian behavior and this characteristic is fundamental in aiding red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> to squeeze through capillaries.|$|R
5|$|Inhaling a xenon/oxygen mixture {{activates}} {{production of}} the transcription factor HIF-1-alpha, which may lead to increased production of erythropoietin. The latter hormone is known to increase red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> production and athletic performance. Reportedly, doping with xenon inhalation {{has been used in}} Russia since 2004 and perhaps earlier. On August 31, 2014, the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) added xenon (and argon) to the list of prohibited substances and methods, although no reliable doping tests for these gases have yet been developed. In addition, effects of xenon on erythropoietin production in humans have not been demonstrated, so far.|$|E
5|$|Like many {{scientists}} {{working on the}} project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her white <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count halved. The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.|$|E
5|$|The first clue to a {{diagnosis}} of AML is typically an abnormal result on a complete blood count. While an excess of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytosis) is a common finding with the leukemia, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in platelets, red blood cells, or even with a low white <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count (leukopenia). While a presumptive diagnosis of AML {{can be made by}} examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as ruling out pernicious anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency), folic acid deficiency and copper deficiency.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the bone}} marrow {{contains}} hematopoietic stem cells, which give rise to the three classes of <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> that {{are found in the}} circulation: white <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> (leukocytes), red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> (erythrocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes).|$|R
50|$|Nurse {{cells are}} {{specialized}} macrophages {{residing in the}} bone marrow that assist {{in the development of}} red <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b> They absorb the nuclei of immature red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> and may provide growth factors to help the red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> mature. In the bone marrow, immature red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> (erythroblasts) can be seen grouped in a cluster around a nurse cell.|$|R
50|$|It is {{theorized that}} transfusions that contain white <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> may cause adverse effects through {{multiple}} mechanisms. White <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> may themselves harbor infectious disease and some pathogens {{will be more}} concentrated in white <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> {{than the rest of}} the blood product. It is also theorized that the donor white <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> may suppress the recipient's immune system by interacting with it.|$|R
5|$|The {{reactors}} {{were used}} to undertake research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of tritium. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 {{over the course of}} a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his white <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with the}} blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white <b>blood</b> <b>cell.</b> Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
5000|$|Bone marrow {{failure occurs}} in {{individuals}} who produce an insufficient amount of red <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> white <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> or platelets.

Bone marrow also contains platelets, which trigger clotting, and thus help stop the blood flow when a wound occurs.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: DNA repair is a {{cellular}} defence mechanism responding to DNA damage caused {{in large part}} by oxidative stress. There is a controversy with regard to the effect of red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> on DNA damage and cellular response. AIM: To investigate the effect of red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> on H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage and repair in human peripheral <b>blood</b> mononuclear <b>cells.</b> METHODS: DNA breaks were induced in peripheral <b>blood</b> mononuclear <b>cells</b> by H 2 O 2 in the absence or presence of red <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> hemolysate or hemoglobin. DNA repair was measured by (3) H-thymidine uptake, % double-stranded DNA was measured by fluorometric assay of DNA unwinding. DNA damage was measured by the comet assay and by the detection of histone H 2 AX phosphorylation. RESULTS: Red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> and red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> hemolysate reduced DNA repair in a dose-dependent manner. Red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> hemolysate reduced % double-stranded DNA, DNA damage and phosphorylation of histone H 2 AX. Hemoglobin had the same effect as red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> hemolysate on % double-stranded DNA. CONCLUSION: Red <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> via red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> hemolysate and hemoglobin, reduced the effect of oxidative stress on peripheral <b>blood</b> mononuclear <b>cell</b> DNA damage and phosphorylation of histone H 2 AX. Consequently, recruitment of DNA repair proteins diminished with reduction of DNA repair. This suggests that anemia predisposes to increased oxidative stress induced DNA damage, while a higher hemoglobin level provides protection against oxidative-stress-induced DNA damage...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Comparatively to open repair, {{endovascular}} aneurysm repair {{has reduced}} transfusion rates but thereâs no recommendation about number of red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units to be crossmatched preoperatively. Our aim is {{contribute to the}} analysis of red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units needs in endovascular and hybrid aortic aneurysm repair and developing a protocol for maximum surgical blood orders schedule. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed our prospective database of elective endovascular aneurysm repair from 2001 to 2012. We analyzed patients' age, gender, ASA classification, maximum surgical blood orders schedule, red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units transfused and timings, types of endoprosthesis, red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units consumption/endoprosthesis' type ratio, crossmatch to transfusion ratio, conversion to open repair, hemoglobin concentrations before surgery and discharge. RESULTS: We selected 187 patients, 90 % men, mean age 73. 1, ASA mode III. The endoprosthesis were aorto-bi-iliac in 71 %, aorto-uni-iliac in 23 % and thoracic in 6 %. Of these, 72, 6 % of the patients did not require blood transfusion. We transfused 171 red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units. Crossmatch to transfusion ratio was 10. 1 until 2010 and 7. 3 after. The ratio of red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units consumption/endoprosthesis in the first 24 hours was 0. 21 red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units/aorto-bi-iliac, 0. 46 red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units/aorto-uni-iliac, 0. 8 red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units/thoracic, 1. 3 red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units/hybrid-thoracic and 2 red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units/hybrid-aorto-bi-iliac. A statistical correlation was observed between red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units transfused postoperatively and type of endoprosthesis (p < 0. 001) and between ASA classification and red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units transfused after 24 hours (p < 0. 01). DISCUSSION: Guidelines from the British Society of Haematology are based on a crossmatch to transfusion ratio of 2 : 1. Our crossmatch to transfusion ratio was 10. 1 until 2010 and 7. 3 from 2011 to 2012. CONCLUSION: These results changed our policy of maximum surgical blood orders schedule for endovascular aneurysm repair. We now type and screen aorto-bi-iliac and aorto-uni-iliac. We crossmatch two red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units for thoracic, three red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units for hybrid thoracic and four red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units for hybrid abdominal procedures. This may lead to financial savings, improved efficiency and reduce workload in hematology department. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
