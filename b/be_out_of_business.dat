The market intelligence firm IDC predicts Nikon will <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> in five years if the trend continues. The market has shifted from being driven by hardware to software, and camera manufacturers have not been keeping up.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{generation}} Pony (Pony-Citroën) was produced until 1983; in the meanwhile, the law concerning taxation of similar vehicles had been modified. Plans to manufacture other cars under license were not realized {{and for a}} moment it seemed that NAMCO would once more <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> But the company would bounce back, introducing a completely new model, the Pony Super, introduced in 1985. The second generation Pony had no connection with Citroën technology and was a much more modern car with Ford engines, coming in a number of versions (950 cc , 1100 cc , 1300 cc [...] and 1600 cc [...] diesel, in two- and four-door arrangements). It was essentially developed by NAMCO, since Inthelco, a German company also involved in its development, was majority-owned by NAMCO at the time. An ambitious plan was made to export the car to the U.S. with a 1900 cc engine via Inthelco as the Desta at a rate of 20,000 per year. However, the costs and prospects proved to be grossly miscalculated and the plan was abandoned. No matter how improved the new Pony was, it was still {{a far cry from the}} needs of the contemporary Greek market made of progressively more affluent and demanding consumers. Only a few hundred Pony Super's were built until 1992.|$|E
