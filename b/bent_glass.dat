6000|$|Putting that {{solution}} aside, {{let us now}} {{see what}} effect this instrument will have upon water. Here are two little platinum-plates which I intend to make {{the ends of the}} battery, and this (C) is a little vessel so shaped as to enable me to take it to pieces, and shew you its construction. In these two cups (A and B) I pour mercury, which touches the ends of the wires connected with the platinum-plates. In the vessel (C) I pour some water containing a little acid (but which is put only for the purpose of facilitating the action; it undergoes no change in the process), and connected with the top of the vessel is a <b>bent</b> <b>glass</b> tube (D), which may remind you of the pipe which was connected with the gun barrel in our furnace experiment, and which now passes under the jar (F). I have now adjusted this apparatus, and we will proceed to affect the water in some way or other. In the other case, I sent the water through a tube which was made red-hot; I am now going to pass the electricity through the contents of this vessel. Perhaps I may boil the water; if I do boil the water, I shall get steam; and you know that steam condenses when it gets cold, and you will therefore see by that whether I do boil the water or not. Perhaps, however, I shall not boil the water, but produce some other effect. You shall have the experiment and see. There is one wire which I will put to this side (A), and here is the other wire which I will put to the other side (B), and you will soon see whether any disturbance takes place. Here it is seeming to boil up famously; but does it boil? Let us see whether that which goes out is steam or not. I think you will soon see the jar (F) will be filled with vapour, if that which rises from the water is steam. But can it be steam? Why, certainly not; because there it remains, you see, unchanged. There it is standing over the water, and it cannot therefore be steam, but must be a permanent gas of some sort What is it? Is it hydrogen? Is it anything else? Well, we will examine it. If it is hydrogen, it will burn. [The Lecturer then ignited a portion of the gas collected, which burnt with an explosion.] ...|$|E
60|$|Now, I {{take this}} <b>bent</b> <b>glass</b> tube, and {{introduce}} one end into {{that part of}} the flame, and you see at once that something is coming from the flame, out {{at the other end of}} the tube; and if I put a flask there, and leave it for a little while, you will see that something from the middle part of the flame is gradually drawn out, and goes through the tube and into that flask, and there behaves very differently from what it does in the open air. It not only escapes from the end of the tube, but falls down to the bottom of the flask like a heavy substance, as indeed it is. We find that this is the wax of the candle made into a vaporous fluid--not a gas. (You must learn the difference between a gas and a vapour: a gas remains permanent, a vapour is something that will condense.) If you blow out a candle, you perceive a very nasty smell, resulting from the condensation of this vapour. That is very different from what you have outside the flame; and, in order to make that more clear to you, I am about to produce and set fire to a larger portion of this vapour--for what we have in the small way in a candle, to understand thoroughly, we must, as philosophers, produce in a larger way, if needful, that we may examine the different parts. And now Mr. Anderson will give me a source of heat, and I am about to shew you what that vapour is. Here is some wax in a glass flask, and I am going to make it hot, as the inside of that candle-flame is hot, and the matter about the wick is hot. [The Lecturer placed some wax in a glass flask, and heated it over a lamp.] Now, I dare say that is hot enough for me. You see that the wax I put in it has become fluid, and there is a little smoke coming from it. We shall very soon have the vapour rising up. I will make it still hotter, and now we get more of it, so that I can actually pour the vapour out of the flask into that basin, and set it on fire there. This, then, is exactly the same kind of vapour as we have in the middle of the candle; and that you may be sure this is the case, let us try whether we have not got here, in this flask, a real combustible vapour out of the middle of the candle. [Taking the flask into which the tube from the candle proceeded, and introducing a lighted taper.] See how it burns. Now, this is the vapour from the middle of the candle, produced by its own heat; and that is one of the first things you have to consider with respect to the progress of the wax in the course of its combustion, and as regards the changes it undergoes. I will arrange another tube carefully in the flame, and I should not wonder if we were able, by a little care, to get that vapour to pass through the tube to the other extremity, where we will light it, and obtain absolutely the flame of the candle at a place distant from it. Now, look at that. Is not that a very pretty experiment? Talk about laying on gas--why, we can actually lay on a candle! And you see from this that there are clearly two different kinds of action--one the production of the vapour, and the other the combustion of it--both of which take place in particular parts of the candle.|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} flat glass {{is high and}} {{increasing}} significantly in the building industry {{as a direct result}} of architectural requirements for lightness, transparency and natural light. Current architectural trends require glass in curvilinear forms for smooth free-form façades. Two principal challenges arise from this: to cost-effectively produce the desired curvature and; to ensure its safe performance after exposure to ageing. The recent availability of high strength glass provides an opportunity to address the first challenge by developing cold <b>bent</b> <b>glass.</b> Cold bending involves the straining of relatively thin glass components, at ambient temperatures, and is a low energy and cost effective manner of creating curvilinear forms. However, cold bending is not yet widely established as a reliable method. The aim of this thesis is to develop the understanding of cold <b>bent</b> <b>glass</b> during the bending process and to evaluate its post-ageing performance. This thesis, firstly, investigates the mechanical response of monolithic glass plates during the cold bending process. The stability of cold <b>bent</b> <b>glass</b> is investigated experimentally by bending it in double curved anticlastic shapes. A parametric numerical analysis involves different boundary conditions, geometrical plate characteristics and bending parameters. The principal outcome is that a local instability, now termed cold bending distortion, occurs when certain displacement limits are exceeded and could degrade the optical quality of the glass. An evaluation procedure is also formulated to set limits and aid designers/manufacturers to predict the mechanical response and the optical quality of the glass. Cold <b>bent</b> <b>glass</b> is subjected to permanent bending stresses throughout its service life and therefore, its strength degradation after ageing needs to be quantified. Analytical, experimental and numerical investigations are undertaken in this thesis to identify the most effective method for estimating glass strength (evaluation of destructive tests, required number of specimens, statistical analysis methods and sub-critical crack growth). The limited availability of naturally aged toughened glass and the absence of a reliable ageing standard impede the evaluation of its aged performance. Therefore, a parametric experimental investigation of artificial ageing methods on glass is undertaken in this thesis. A procedure for the evaluation of the strength of aged glass is finally, formulated to allow the selection of artificial ageing parameters that correspond to a target level of erosion. The knowledge on artificial ageing and strength prediction acquired above is finally implemented on different types of glass to determine their strength after ageing and assess their safe use in cold bending / load bearing applications. The investigation showed that fully toughened glass has a superior performance to chemically toughened or annealed glass. Overall, the research presented in this thesis demonstrates that high quality cold bent toughened glass can be created when certain applied displacement limits are respected. These can be used as a safe, cost-effective and energy efficient replacement to the more conventional hot <b>bent</b> <b>glass.</b> However, cold bending / load bearing applications in which the stressed glass surface is exposed to ageing, require glass with a relatively high case depth such as fully toughened or bi-tempered glass.

We find that when a proximal portion of the flagellum is <b>bent</b> with a <b>glass</b> microprobe, {{the remainder of the}} flagellum distal to the probe exhibits a bend in the opposite direction (a counterbend). The counterbend can be understood from the prevailing sliding doublet model of axoneme mechanics, but does require the existence of elastic linkages between the outer doublets. Analysis of the shapes of counterbends provides a consensus value of 0. 03 - 0. 08 /µm^ 2 for the ratio of the interdoublet shear resistance (E_S) to the bending resistance (E_B) and we find that the ratio E_S/E_B is relatively conserved for both passive flagella and transiently quiescent live flagella. This ratio expresses a fundamental mechanical property of the eukaryotic axoneme. It defines the contributions to total bending resistance derived from bending the microtubules and from stretching the interdoublet linkages, respectively. Using this ratio, and computer simulations of earlier experiments that measured the total stiffness of the flagellum, we obtain estimates of approximately 1 × 10 ^ 8 pN nm^ 2 /rad for E_B and 6 pN/rad for E_S, assuming that both elasticities are linear.

5000|$|Unique tower {{envelope}} made of cold-bent glass {{emphasizes the}} lightness and {{dynamic of the}} form visually denying the gravity force. Two hundred meters high sculpture, crafted of materials traditionally believed to be fragile and inflexible, symbolizes the idea of evolution spiral as the pinnacle of progress {{and the power of}} human intellect, challenging the forces of nature and the laws of physics. Original façade concept and innovative construction technology allow to create visually organic and flowing 3D form. Double curved tower envelope is provided by the cold bending of reflective glass units. The innovative cold-bent glazing in the curtain wall uses flat double glazed units cold-formed in 3D within the aluminum frame to avoid stepping in geometry. This approach appeared to be both more energy-efficient and more cost-efficient solution in comparison to the stepped curtain wall units previously applied in some twisted unitized facades. During factory fabrication the glass unit is placed in the twisted aluminum frame horizontally and then takes curved shape by its own weight without any thermal treatment. Maximum corner deformation does not exceed 50 mm relative to the opposite corner of the unit. Finally façade looks like continuously twisted spiral glass surface. Currently this curtain wall is the world’s largest cold bent façade in terms of the area in one building. Organic cold-bent glazed ribbon with constant leaning angle at the corners (approx. 14 degrees vertically) creates a stunning optical illusion reflecting the surrounding cityscape vertically with 90-degree twist.Evolution tower total façade area is 40,500 sq m, including 34,500 sq m of the typical facade areas from 3-rd to 51-st level. On each floor the curtain wall consists of 108 parallelogram façade panels 4.3 m high and 1.5m wide. 27 of them have 2 types of different sizes that vary with twist angle from +14 to -14 that largely complicated the construction logistics. However the implementation of this façade structure was successful due to involvement of German façade company Joseph Gartner (Permasteelisa Group) in design and production of tower curtain wall, atrium glazing and canopies /entrances. The company was selected through the tender with 30 façade manufacturers competing for a prestigious contract. The aluminum profiles were extruded in Russia at a specially arranged production line. Despite glass units fabrication in Germany with all associated delivery and customs duties the overall façade cost per m2 remained within the budget of a ‘standard’ benchmark high-rise tower, that was an achievement of German logistics. Double glazed units with energy-efficient multi-functional glass (manufactured by Guardian) provide the energy efficiency and thermal insulation parameters (U-Value) similar to those of standard triple glazed units but with less weight in panoramic floor to ceiling application. The units themselves were assembled in Germany by BGT, who provided long-time warranty for cold <b>bent</b> heat-strengthened <b>glass</b> in a result of multiple tests. Transparent double glazed units consist of triplex 8+6mm from heat-strengthened glass from the outside and 8mm Guardian Standard HP Neutral 60/40 tempered glass on the inside with application of energy efficient coating, significantly reducing the solar gain whilst providing the double glazed unit thermal performance equal to a standard triple glazed unit normally used in Moscow to withstand harsh winter conditions. Guardian SunGuard production technology allows to create almost perfect combination of transparent and spandrel façade areas. Guardian magnetron coating has a special feature - it is colored outside and transparent on the inside, which does not distort the view color unlike tinted glass in mass. With no color filter (color is from the coating, not from coloured glass) the high color quality provides comfortable environment inside the building given that the glass panel is 3m high (floor to ceiling) the perfect daylighting is provided in the office spaces. Glass unit formula with heat-strengthened triplex outside and tempered glass inside allows bending of the unit in installation position to achieve required façade geometry providing additional safety of envelope structure , as in case of destruction the tempered glass (5 times stronger than usual) is fractured in small pieces and triplex lamination film protects it from falling out. Heat strengthened glass triplex gains additional strength and reduces the risk of glass destruction via associated heat soak tests as part of the production process.|$|R
40|$|The {{geometrical}} {{pattern of}} cold <b>bent</b> <b>glass</b> sheets, {{to be used}} in curved facades, has been investigated by experimental, analytical and numerical research. From a design point of view it was necessary to gain more knowledge about warping of glass panes. In experiments by increasing warping, the deformed shape of the pane suddenly changes from one geometrical mode to another. This phenomenon is caused by buckling of one of the diagonals. By means of a lattice model, for the transition point, at which the geometrical mode changes, a linear relation between the deformation at the corner and the thickness of the plate was derived for a certain ratio of plate length and width. Based on a plate model, the influence of the plate dimensions and the material properties on the moment of transition were investigated numerically...|$|E
