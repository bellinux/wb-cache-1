40|$|We reconstituted metachronal {{waves on}} ciliated {{cortical}} sheets prepared from detergent-extracted Paramecium multimicronucleatum cells. Ciliary {{movements of the}} cortical sheet, whose intracellular side adhered to a glass coverslip, were reactivated by perfusion of a <b>basic</b> reactivation <b>medium</b> containing ATP. In this condition, the ciliary field showed only unstable localised ripples. Addition of either cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP to the <b>basic</b> reactivation <b>medium</b> generated propagating metachronal waves characteristic of each nucleotide. In order to estimate {{the stability of the}} metachronal waves, autocorrelation coefficients were calculated from images of an 8 mm diameter region within the reactivated ciliary field. The decay time for the correlation coefficient to decrease to 0. 5 was only 0. 04 s in the <b>basic</b> reactivation <b>medium,</b> but was increased to 0. 4 or 0. 9 s by the addition of cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP, respectively. The decay time was dependent not only on the concentration of cyclic nucleotide but also on the wave frequency. In order to test whether cyclic-nucleotide-dependent phosphorylation affected the generation of waves, the ciliated cortical sheets were thiophosphorylated by incubation in ATP-g-S (adenosine- 59 -o- 3 -thiotriphosphate) medium containing either cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP. Following this, perfusion with the <b>basic</b> reactivation <b>medium</b> generated metachronal waves only after cyclic GMP treatment. The effect of cyclic GMP is probably related to phosphorylation of ciliary proteins...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Materials Science and Engineering, İzmir, 1999 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 84 - 86) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishviii, 89 leavesThe aim of {{this study}} was the investigation of stable Ti 02 powder suspenSIO formation in water. The water based paints are environmentally safe and expected to replace organic based solvents. Four different commercial titania pigment powders with different characteristics were used. Only a high molecular weight surfactant was used. Suspensions were prepared for four titania powders at 5, 1 O,and 20 % by volume solid content and the same suspensions were used in the investigation {{of the effects of the}} surfactant on the stability of suspensions. The surfactant was added in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 5 % by weight of pigment. Two characterization methods were used III the analysis: sedimentation and rheological characterization. It has been found that there are some stable pH ranges for the suspensions prepared by four Ti 02 powders. In these ranges, it is expected to behave as dilatant - shear thickening and the sediment was densely packed. Three zones, sediment, falling and supernatant zones, were observed in disperse suspensions [...] As a result of this, the pH ranges of these powders in water is observed visually. If it has rutile structure in powder C G (95 % Ti 02 content, 5 % Ab 03 coated), it works very well in <b>basic</b> <b>mediums.</b> Also rutile powder G (99 % Ti 02 content, uncoated), it is expected at pH. 2 and <b>basic</b> <b>mediums.</b> The anatase powders,E and F (both are 99 % Ti 02 content, uncoated), are stable in <b>basic</b> <b>mediums.</b> The F has wider stable zone than the powder E. The results of this work have shown that rutile alumina coated powder C suspensions were stable in basic media. Rutile powder G suspensions were stable at pH. 2 and basic media. Anatase powders E and F were stable in basic media with powder F being stable in a wider pH range. The combined analysis of sedimentation -rheological behaviour of suspensions were found to be very helpful in understanding the suspension behaviours. Relatively high sediment packing densities in the 50 - 60 % of theoretical titania density were obtained for some of the suspensions...|$|R

40|$|Aromatic rice {{is highly}} prized by {{consumers}} worldwide {{due to its}} special aromatic character. 2 -acetyl- 1 -pyrroline (2 -AP) {{is considered to be}} the single most important volatile compound responsible for aroma in aromatic rice. The present study demonstrated the effects of 2 -AP, zinc (Zn) and lanthanum (La) on the 2 -AP concentration of detached aromatic rice panicles in vitro. Detached panicles from three well-known aromatic cultivars, Guixiangzhan, Pin 14, and Pin 15, were cultured separately in <b>basic</b> culture <b>medium</b> supplemented with 2 -AP, Zn and La, and 2 -AP concentrations were assessed at 7 and 14 days after culture (DAC). The results show that supplementation of 2 -AP, Zn and La in the <b>basic</b> culture <b>medium</b> significantly increases the accumulation of proline. 2 -AP concentration and the activity of proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) were also increased in rice grains. Zn concentrations were also found to be higher when Zn was added to the <b>basic</b> culture <b>medium,</b> and La concentrations in grains were too low to be measured. Additionally, grain 2 -AP concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with proline concentrations, ProDH activities in grains and 2 -AP in culture medium. In summary, higher grain 2 -AP concentrations might be due to Zn- and La-induced increases in proline concentrations and ProDH activities, as well as the direct uptake and transportation of 2 -AP from the culture medium. Furthermore, application of both Zn and La might be helpful for improving aroma formation in rice. However, interactions of both these elements with the complex process of 2 -AP formation remain to be explored...|$|R

40|$|A {{previously}} described isolation procedure for collagen {{of the marine}} sponge Chondrosia reniformis Nardo was modified for scaling-up reasons yielding 30 % of collagen (freeze-dried collagen in relation to freeze-dried sponge). Light microscope observations showed fibrous structures. Transmission electron microscopy studies proved the collagenous nature of this material: high magnifications showed the typical periodic banding-pattern of collagen fibres. However, {{the results of the}} amino acid analysis differed from most publications, presumably due to impurities that still were present. In agreement with earlier studies, sponge collagen was insoluble in dilute acid mediums and all solvents investigated. Dispersion of collagen was facilitated when dilute <b>basic</b> <b>mediums</b> were employed. The acid-base properties of the material were investigated by titration. Furthermore, a sponge extract was incorporated in two different formulations and compared with their extract free analogues and a commercially available collagen containing product with respect to their effects on biophysical skin parameters.
