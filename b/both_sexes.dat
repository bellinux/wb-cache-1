5|$|<b>Both</b> <b>sexes</b> {{build the}} nest; the {{building}} periods {{can be as}} brief as three days to as long as four weeks.

Egg color varies; they can appear bluish green to pale yellowish blue, spotted abundantly in reddish brown. <b>Both</b> <b>sexes</b> incubate but the female is mainly responsible {{as well as being}} the sole provider of brooding. Curve-billed parents defend their nests fervently against other species; snakes are the most frequent predators of eggs and nestlings. Curved-billed Thrashers are rarely victims of nest parasitism by cowbirds. In situations where food is scarce, parents feed older fledglings first. The fledging period ranges from 11 to 18 days.|$|E

5|$|Portia fimbriata, {{sometimes}} called the fringed jumping spider, is a jumping spider (family Salticidae) found in Australia and Southeast Asia.

However, specimens from New Guinea and Indonesia have orange-brown carapaces and yellowish abdomens. In all species of the genus Portia, the abdomen distends when the spider is well fed or producing eggs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In Mormidea paupercula (n = 6 + XY in males), the {{presence}} of a CMA 3 -bright band in the telomeric regions on <b>both</b> <b>sex</b> chromosomes allowed the analysis of the kinetic activity of the sex univalents and XY pseudobivalent at the first and second meiotic divisions, respectively. The separation of the sister chromatids of the sex chromosomes occurs from a pair of telomeric regions (with or without a band), with opposite telomeric regions remaining associated with each other at meiosis I; the behaviour of <b>both</b> <b>sex</b> chromosomes differs, on the X chromosome both telomeric regions are similarly active, while on the Y chromosome the telomeric region without a band is more frequently active. At the second division, the most frequent associations in the pseudobivalent occur between the telomeric regions of <b>both</b> <b>sex</b> chromosomes with bands or without bands. Therefore, in both meiotic divisions, the same telomeric region on the sex chromosomes could lead the migration, in contrast to that observed usually in autosomal bivalents. These results provide evidence that the sex chromosomes of Heteroptera show more than one pattern of attachment to the spindle...|$|R
