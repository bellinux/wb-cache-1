50|$|In the U.S., land {{administered}} by the Army Corps of Engineers, such as those <b>bordering</b> <b>levees</b> and lakes, is often desirable for building courses, due to the scenic natural views and the unsuitability of the land for other purposes due to it lying in a planned flood plain. In these cases, the course designer must work with the Corps of Engineers to plan a course layout that protects environmentally sensitive areas, provides for a means of quick escape in case of flooding, and does not invite players to hit into or toward controlled structures such as levees or dams.|$|R

5000|$|Today, Noyes is {{essentially}} a quiet community. Because of its proximity to the flood-prone Red River, it is protected by a levee which extends south from Emerson. The levee was built in 1989 {{as part of an}} International Levee agreement between both countries.

50|$|In 2002 the Corps of Engineers, in {{conjunction}} with the Louisiana Water Resources Research Institute at Louisiana State University (LSU), and the authorities in Jefferson Parish, modeled the effects and aftermath of a Category 5 strike on New Orleans. The model predicted an unprecedented disaster, with extensive loss of life and property. The study identified the problem: the New Orleans area is like a bowl, surrounded by levees which are strongest along the outer Mississippi and primarily intended to contain river flooding. When a hurricane drives water into Lake Pontchartrain, the weaker <b>levees</b> <b>bordering</b> Pontchartrain and canals leading to it are overwhelmed. Water then flows into the below-sea-level city, accompanied by water overflowing the levees along the Mississippi {{on the south side of}} the city center.|$|R
50|$|Geologically, the Atchafalaya River {{has been}} a backswamp, low area between the paths of the Mississippi River {{through the process of}} delta switching, which has built the {{extensive}} delta plain of Louisiana. The natural levees of the Mississippi River (on the east) and the levees along its previous course (now Bayou Teche) on the west define the Atchafalaya Basin. The central basin is further <b>bordered</b> by man-made <b>levees</b> designed to contain and funnel floodwaters released from the Mississippi at the Old River Control Structure and the Morganza Spillway south toward Morgan City and eventually to the Gulf of Mexico. Historically there were small and few channel connections to the Mississippi River. The historic lack of significant channel connection indicates that the Atchafalaya River Basin did not receive significant sediment from the Mississippi except during large floods.|$|R
40|$|Helene, (approximately 17. 6 {{kilometers}} mean radius) is an L 4 Trojan co-orbital of Saturn's moon Dione. Its hemisphere {{features an}} unusual morphology consisting of broad depressions and a generally smooth surface patterned with streaks and grooves. The streaks {{appear to be}} oriented down-gradient, as are the grooves. This pattern suggests intensive mass-wasting as a dominant process on the leading hemisphere. Kilometer-scale impact craters are very sparse on the leading hemisphere other than the degraded kilometer-scale basins defining the overall satellite shape, and many small craters have a diffuse appearance suggesting ongoing mass wasting. Thus mass wasting must dominate surface-modifying processes at present. In fact, the mass wasting {{appears to have been}} sufficient in magnitude to narrow the divides between adjacent basins to narrow septa, similar, but in lower relief, to the honeycomb pattern of Hyperion. The prominent groves occur primarily near topographic divides and appear have cut into a broad, slightly lower albedo surface largely conforming to the present topography but elevated a few meters above the smooth surfaces undergoing mass wasting flow. Low ridges and albedo markings on the surface suggest surface flow of materials traveling up to several kilometers. Diffusive mass wasting produces smooth surfaces - such a pattern characterizes most of the low-lying surfaces. The grooves, however, imply that the transport process is advective at those locations where they occur, that is, erosion tends to concentrate along linear pathways separated by divides. In fact, in many places grooves have a fairly regular spacing of 125 - 160 meters, defining a characteristic erosional scale. Several questions are prompted by the unusual morphology of Helene: 1) What {{is the nature of the}} surface materials? 2) Are the transport processes gradual or catastrophic motion from one or a few events? 3) What mechanisms drive mass wasting and groove development? 4) Have the formative processes been active in the recent past? 5) Finally, is the surface accreting or eroding? The smooth character of the leading edge hemisphere of Helene and the dominance of mass wasting suggest that the surface is composed of fine-grained debris, probably dominated by dust-size to small gravel particles. The Lagrangian points of saturnian satellites are locations where planetesimals might have accreted to form co-orbital satellites such as and they may capture ejecta from their master moon. Published models suggest that Helene is a site of net accretion, but we find no extant explanation for the dominance of fine grain sizes for the surface (and probable subsurface) composition of Helene and the other Lagrangian satellites. Observation of the mass wasting tracks on Helene suggests the presence of well-defined streams of debris with low <b>bordering</b> <b>levees</b> that may be depositional features or remnants of the dissected higher surface. Some flows in grazing illumination appear to have a convex cross-section. This mass-flow morphology might be consistent with the occurrence of large-scale flow events, but which might have occurred through rapid emplacement or slow glacier-like creep. On the other hand, small craters appear to have been "softened" by creep-like processes, indicating ongoing mass wasting...|$|R
50|$|Streamflow confers {{on society}} both {{benefits}} and hazards. Runoff downstream {{is a means}} to collect water for storage in dams for power generation of water abstraction. The flow of water assists transport downstream. A given watercourse has a maximum streamflow rate that can be accommodated by the channel, and which can be calculated. If the streamflow exceeds this maximum rate, as happens when an excessive amount of water {{is present in the}} watercourse, the channel cannot handle all the water and flooding occurs. The 1993 Mississippi river flood, the largest ever recorded on the river, was a response to a heavy, long duration spring and summer rainfalls. Early rains saturated the soil over more than a 300,000 square miles of the upper watershed, greatly reducing infiltration and leaving soils with little or no storage capacity. As rains continued, surface depressions, wetlands, ponds, ditches, and farm fields filled with overland flow and rainwater. With no remaining capacity to hold water, additional rainfall was forced from the land into tributary channels and thence to the Mississippi. For more than a month, the total load of water from hundreds of tributaries exceeded the Mississippi’s channel capacity, causing it to spill over its banks onto adjacent floodplains. Where the flood waters were artificially constricted by an engineered channel <b>bordered</b> by constructed <b>levees</b> and unable to spill onto large section of floodplain, the flood levels forced even higher.|$|R
40|$|Major {{changes in}} estuarine water quality {{following}} flood events {{are influenced by}} the duration of floodwater-floodplain contact and the dynamics of floodwater recession as controlled by floodplain geomorphology. Episodic large-scale deoxygenation events causing mass mortality of benthic and aquatic biota can follow these events. This study examines the timing and sources of poor quality water entering a sub-tropical coastal estuary in eastern Australia following a flood event. The results have implications for targeted river and floodplain management to improve water quality. The Richmond River is a mature barrier estuary with a large floodplain to upper catchment ratio. The lower floodplain is characterised by extensive, well-developed natural levees grading into large backswamp basins. Prior to European modification of floodplain hydrology, these backswamp basins were semi-permanent wetlands and natural storage basins for floodwaters occluded from the main channel by the morphology of natural levee systems. Following a 1 : 10 year flood event, the Richmond River estuary was closed to commercial and recreational fishing due to a fish-kill event attributed to deoxygenation of 3 ̆e 30 km of the main channel. Floodwater samples were collected along the estuary for one month following the flood peak and aqueous geochemistry analysed. Upper catchment inflows to the estuary remained well-oxygenated during the event and therefore, were not the source of the deoxygenating water. The primary source of the deoxygenating waters during the flood recession phase were the major mid-estuary backswamp basins identified by their unique anaerobic geochemical signature. Large constructed drains, which alter floodplain hydrology, dissect the natural <b>levees</b> <b>bordering</b> backswamp basins to allow floodwaters to drain from the backswamps into the main river channel at an enhanced rate. Whilst lower quality floodwaters were previously largely retained in backswamp basins during the flood recession phase, these waters are now exported to the main river channel causing declines in river health...|$|R
40|$|Salinisation {{threatens the}} {{sustainability}} of irrigated paddy fields in western Africa. To reclaim saline soils and improve the management of irrigated paddy fields, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate and monitor soil salinity in space and time. Proximal soil sensing by apparent electrical resistivity (ER) measurements can help to survey soil salinity. This study aimed to assess changes in the spatial pattern of salinity in vertisols using high resolution 3 D mapping at 2 dates on an 8 -ha experimental site located at Kollo, Niger, along the Niger River. For each measurement campaign, the survey combined ER and electrical conductivity (EC) measurements of a 1 : 5 soil:water extract. This procedure was performed in May 2008 and again in March 2011 after a 100 -year flood of the study area by the Niger River. EC measurements were performed on soil samples collected at 3 depths at 140 points. ER measurements were performed at 420 points at 2 and 4 depths for the first and second campaigns, respectively. We built an inference model of EC using a regression-tree method for 3 prediction depths. The predictive data were the two ER measurements, their ratio and a qualitative description of land use. The maps generated by ordinary kriging of predicted EC revealed strong lateral salinity gradients ranging from 03 to 5. 0 dS/m (RMSE = 0. 79 - 0. 83 dS/m). Vertical variability in salinity was also significant and its pattern could be explained by land use, mainly irrigation intensity. In 2011, salt stocks in the upper 60 cm of the soil ranged from low stocks (< 2 kg/m(2)) to extremely high stocks along the <b>levee</b> <b>border</b> (5. 5 - 8. 0 kg/m(2)). Comparisons of the 2008 and 2011 salinity maps at 3 depths indicated stable spatial patterns and highlighted the high resilience of the system. Consequently, desalinisation efforts can only minimise soil salinity in the upper cultivated horizon. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} two main thrusts. The {{first part of}} the study {{addresses}} static seepage and stability of California levees as related to the presence of woody vegetation. The second part of this study addresses seismic deformations related to California levees through calibration, validation, and sensitivity analysis of a constitutive model implemented to capture seismic embankment deformations. Two field tests were conducted to investigate the effects of seepage in the vicinity of live and decaying tree root systems {{to examine the effects of}} live and decaying root systems on levee seepage and slope stability. The first field test involved the construction of parallel trenches in the vicinity of a eucalyptus stump located along the landside of the northern <b>levee</b> <b>bordering</b> the American River adjacent to the California Exposition and State Fair. A live hackberry tree with healthy roots was present at the toe of the levee. A control set of parallel trenches was constructed away from the eucalyptus stump. During the test, the upslope trench was flooded and maintained at constant head to induce slope-parallel seepage and the downslope trench was used to make observations and collect any intercepted seepage. Piezometers and tensiometers were installed to measure positive and negative pore water pressures within the zone of flow to describe the wetting and flow patterns as they evolved within the levee. Instrumentation was installed to assess the influence of the stump and its decomposing root system. Live roots, mammal burrows, and other features added complexity to the system. In addition to instrumentation data, visual observations were recorded during the 6 day flow test. During the flow test, wetting front and water flow patterns appeared to be dominated by flow through a network of shallow mammal burrows. Physical observation of the saturation front, as seen from the lower wall, confirmed that the area below the stump was the last location to saturate during the wetting test. Ground-based tripod light detection and ranging (T-LiDAR) was used to complement traditional logging and for constructing a 3 D model of the root system, burrows and stratigraphy. Preliminary computer simulations of the advance of the wetting front support the basic patterns observed in the field test. The second field experiment was conducted along the crown of a bypassed levee along an oxbow segment of the seven mile slough on Twitchell Island in Rio Vista, California. An 8 -foot deep crown trench was excavated to extend through the root system of a land side live oak tree, a water side valley oak tree, and a control section. The test was designed to evaluate the effects of seepage in the vicinity of live tree root systems. During the test, the crown trench was flooded and maintained at constant head to simulate a flood condition with water delivered from the center of the levee. Piezometers and tensiometers were installed to measure positive and negative pore water pressures, respectively, within the zone of flow to describe the wetting and flow patterns as they evolved within the levee. Burrow networks, fracturing, and gapping within levee soils, as well as variability of stratigraphic conditions across the site added complexity. Visual observations were made during the flow test to view surficial seepage and flow patterns from the surface in addition to continuous monitoring of subsurface instruments. The site contained an extensive network of muskrat burrows in addition to burrows by other species and the initial advance of the wetting front appeared to be related to burrowing activity. With increased time and saturation of levee soils, flow through macropores appeared to diminish. The levee appears to have been founded on overbank deposits comprised of lower permeability soils than the overlying levee fill. Water appeared to accumulate on this stratigraphic layer, driving seepage patterns on the landside of the levee. A break in this low permeability layer affected flow patterns while the slope of this layer toward this break appears to have added a three dimensional effect to flow patterns. Cracking was observed in the crown road along the levee crest within the first 24 hours of the flow test. After approximately 40 hours of flow, the waterside oak tree, which was initially leaning at an angle of approximately 43 degrees from horizontal, rotated an additional approximately 20 degrees into the slough, creating cracks and deformation along the waterside slope. A dye test was performed as a part of the experiment to better understand the extent of these burrows, their effect on flow patterns, and to better evaluate the role of these burrow networks in the deformations observed on the waterside slope during the flow test. Ground-based tripod light detection and ranging (T-LiDAR) was used to complement our efforts related to tracking deformations during the test. Based on calibrated numerical simulations, trees were found not to play a significant role in seepage-induced rotational or block failure of the levee slopes. However, where trees exhibit significant lean (center of mass extends beyond the fulcrum of the root plate), horizontal roots extending into the levee may place additional loads on the levee embankment. Loading of this type can be incorporated into two dimensional slope stability analyses, using mass-averaging to capture the three-dimensional impact of the tree. Tree overturning was evaluated at the waterside oak tree. Root forces were represented as a single horizontal force and a single vertical force. Horizontally oriented tree root loading increased faster than vertical loading in response to increasing slope angle, while the reverse was true for tree lean where vertical root forces increased more rapidly with increasing tree lean. The method was implemented and successfully captured the observed landside and waterside tree responses during the Crown Trench Seepage Test. The second part of this research focused on seismically induced permanent displacement of earth levees, embankments, and earth-fill slopes resulting from liquefaction below these earth structures. Deformations of this nature are not well captured in current seismic design practice. Ground remediation can be employed to reduce the hazards resulting from soil liquefaction for cases where the analytical tools predict poor seismic performance. There are not sufficient funds to repair all vulnerable levees in the system. Thus, robust analytical procedures are required to evaluate sections of levees where liquefiable foundation materials may lead to significant damage. Inertially driven ground movements of intermediate levels are the primary focus of this study. In these cases, the post-liquefaction static stability of the earth slope is greater than one, and seismically induced permanent displacements result primarily from earthquake shaking after liquefaction is triggered. Limited lateral spreads involving liquefaction of medium dense sand can produce seismic displacements on the order of several centimeters to a meter or more. These levels of seismic displacements are sufficient to damage severely levees. The most commonly employed simplified method for evaluation of seismic deformation at these intermediate levels relies on the concept post-liquefaction residual shear strength. For many practical cases, residual shear strength is ill-defined due to the ever changing resistance provided by soils that undergo repetitive dilative responses during cyclic loading. Where liquefied soils are sufficiently strong to resist flow failures, engineers lack satisfactory tools to evaluate the seismic performance of earth structures that overlie liquefiable soils. A nonlinear soil constitutive model (UBCSAND), which was developed by Professor Byrne and implemented in the finite difference program FLAC, is employed to evaluate seismic deformations of earth structures resulting from liquefaction-induced lateral movements. Analyses of one-element laboratory tests are performed first to develop trends within the UBCSAND soil model calibration parameters. The basic model parameters are correlated to (N 1) 60 values. The UBCSAND model also has four "fitting" parameters. Two of the four model parameters are varied in this study to evaluate the sensitivity of the results to these variations. Triggering is captured with values of the m_hfac 1 parameter with a typical range of 0. 5 to 2. 0 depending on relative density, CSR, and initial static shear stress. The trends identified are implemented in the back-analysis of several case histories, and the ability of the UBCSAND model within the program FLAC to capture observed deformations is evaluated. The numerical simulations of seismic performance at Moss Landing Marine Laboratory and Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute during the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake and at the Juvenile Hall Facility during the 1971 San Fernando Earthquake are shown to capture well the key features of these case histories. The study was generalized through a broader sensitivity study to investigate the seismic performance of earthen embankments built atop potentially liquefiable soils. Several representative levee sections on differing foundations are analyzed, wherein key characteristics, such as the thickness of the liquefiable layer and its relative density, are systematically varied to develop useful insights. The thickness of the liquefiable foundation layer impacted displacements in a non-linear pattern where displacement increased more rapidly as the liquefiable material layer thickness increases. As would be expected, combinations of thicker deposits of liquefiable foundation soils combined with higher embankments yielded the maximum displacement of the cases analyzed in this study. A suite of nine near-fault, forward-directivity, fault-normal soil earthquake ground motions and seven intermediate-field soil earthquake ground motions are used to reflect the seismic hazards most likely to control the design of levees within the San Joaquin-Sacramento delta region of California. The intense forward-directive 1994 Northridge Sylmar Converter Station motion yielded approximately twice as much displacement as the lower intensity backward-directive 1992 Landers Joshua Tree motion. The rate of increase of the calculated liquefaction-induced displacement with increasing Arias intensity was roughly linear for these embankment configurations for the entire suite of earthquake ground motions...|$|R
