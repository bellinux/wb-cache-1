50|$|Caprenin is a fat {{substitute}} {{designed for}} lowering the caloric content of food. Structurally, it resembles normal food fat, being {{made up of}} glycerol and fatty acids (<b>behenic,</b> capric, and caprylic acids). Caprenin contains about 4 kcal per gram, or about half the energy in traditional fats and oils. Caloric reduction results, in part, from incomplete absorption of the unusual fatty acids.|$|E
50|$|Interest in ben oil in Jamaica {{began in}} the first half of the 19th century. The oil had a {{reputation}} for being extremely durable and was often used to lubricate fine mechanics (clocks, for example).

50|$|The main {{components}} of {{rice bran wax}} are aliphatic acids (wax acids) and higher alcohol esters. The aliphatic acids consist of palmitic acid (C16), <b>behenic</b> acid (C22), lignoceric acid (C24), other higher wax acids. The higher alcohol esters consist mainly of ceryl alcohol (C26) and melissyl alcohol (C30). Rice bran wax also contains constituents such as free fatty acids (palmitic acid), squalene and phospholipids.|$|E
50|$|Lactylates {{are also}} {{widely used in}} non-food {{applications}} such as cosmetics or personal care products. In these applications, lactylates function as emulsifiers, conditioners, foam boosters, or plasticizers. These lactylates are typically manufactured from <b>behenic</b> acid, isostearic acid, or medium-chain fatty acids such as capric acid, lauric acid, and myristic acid. The lactylates may also be partially neutralized. For these applications, calcium salts are not typically used, since the resulting lactylates {{will not be as}} readily water dispersible as the sodium analog.|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacturing}} process {{does not produce}} chemically pure lactylates (e.g. stearoyl-2-lactylate) for two reasons. First, the source fatty acid is not chemically pure since it is typically derived from natural sources. The source fatty acid may contain varying ratios of different fatty acids (e.g. lauric acid (C12:0), myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), arachidic acid (C20:0), <b>behenic</b> acid (C22:0), etc.). Second, lactic acid readily undergoes self-esterification producing a variety of polylactyls (typically numbering from one to three lactyl groups).|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} used in Chinese, South Asian and Southeast Asian cuisine, both for general cooking, {{and in the case}} of roasted oil, for added flavor. Peanut oil has a high smoke point {{relative}} to many other cooking oils, so is commonly used for frying foods. Its major component fatty acids are oleic acid (46.8% as olein), linoleic acid (33.4% as linolein), and palmitic acid (10.0% as palmitin). The oil also contains some stearic acid, arachidic acid, <b>behenic</b> acid, lignoceric acid and other fatty acids.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, {{docosanoic acid}} (<b>behenic</b> acid) (2) is {{constructed}} via the fatty acid synthesis pathway. Elovson {{demonstrated that the}} C-14 secondary hydroxyl group of molecule 3 was incorporated by oxidation of the fatty acid with molecular oxygen, as opposed to alkene hydration with water. The next step involves the enzyme-mediated transfer of the sulfate group from 3’-phosphoadenosine 5’-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the diol to form molecule 4. [...] Walsh has demonstrated that the halogenation of the unactivated methyl groups is catalyzed by a newly discovered class of α-ketoglutarate-dependent non-heme iron halogenases. [...] The stepwise chlorination occurs via an order-independent radical mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|Sugarcane wax {{consists}} of the following ingredients: about 70 % of alcohols of long-chain hydrocarbons having chain lengths of C 18 to C 32, wax acids having chain lengths of C 18 to C 32, ω-hydroxycarboxylic acids and aromatic carboxylic acids. Also fatty alcohols (wax alcohols) and diols are alcohol components. Besides that, about 5 to 10 % consist of unesterified diols, long-chain wax acids such as <b>behenic,</b> cerotic, lignoceric or melissic acid and saturated hydrocarbons. Untreated sugarcane wax contains up to 25 % of resin and moreover, up to 60 % polycosanol (octacosanol) which can be extracted from sugarcane wax in the pure form.|$|E
50|$|The {{starting}} point of Goldschmiedt's research at the Universität Straßburg was synthesis of diphenyl trichloroethane, starting from bromal (CBr3CHO) and benzene and following by reduction with hot zinc forming stilbene. In Vienna, his focus changed to natural-product chemistry of plants. He found that the relations between erucic acid, brassidinic acid and <b>behenic</b> acid correspond to the relationship in the three fatty acids oleic acid, elaidic acid and stearic acid. Goldschmiedt also improved the method of Victor Meyer to determine, through vapor density, the molecular mass of compounds with low boiling point. The mineral indralite and the mercury-containing stupp (stupp {{is a mixture of}} mercury, dust, soot and unreacted ore produced in the mercury smeltering process) produced from it became the {{starting point}} for his research of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, especially the two compounds idryle and pyrene. This research took most of his time between 1877 and 1883. In the following five years, Goldschmiedt focused on the determination of the structure of papaverine - a compound found in poppy seed and opium. With his 9th publication on that topic in 1889, he concluded that the structure of papaverine had been solved. At the University of Prague, Goldschmiedt had to perform analysis of the drinking water in Bohemia that slowed his research on other fields. Consequently, the determination of the structure of scutellarin took him many years: after the first publication on that topic in 1901, only in 1910 he managed to obtain enough starting material for more detailed studies. In Prague, he also studied glucuronolactone and ratanhine - a substance found in hardwood Ferreira spectabilis (Sucupira amarela). This substance had been in storage since the first tests by a Ph.D. student of Rochleder in 1868. Although only a small amount was available, Goldschmiedt succeeded to determine that the substance was methyltyrosine.|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition andAllergies (NDA) was asked to deliver a scientiﬁc opinion related to a notiﬁcation from DuPont NutritionBiosciences Aps on <b>behenic</b> acid from mustard seeds {{to be used in}} the {{manufacturing}} of certainemulsiﬁers pursuant to Article 21 (2) of Regulation (EU) No 1169 / 2011 – for permanent exemptionfrom labelling. <b>Behenic</b> acid is produced from rapeseed–mustard seed variants prevalent in India,namely Brassica juncea (L.) Czern. (oriental mustard), Brassica rapa (L.) (brown/yellow Sarson orToria), Brassica napus (L.) (rapeseed) and Brassica nigra (L.) W. D. J. Koch (black mustard). No humanor animal allergenicity data were provided by the applic ant for either <b>behenic</b> acid or the emulsiﬁersmanufactured from beheni c acid. Based on enzyme-linke d immunosorbent assay (ELISA) data, thePanel considers that proteins and peptides may not be carried over into <b>behenic</b> acid after the twodistillation steps reported in the manufacturing process in amounts beyond 1 mg/kg. The Panel notesthat the maximum amount of mustard protein that could be consumed from emulsiﬁers manufacturedfrom <b>behenic</b> acid (E 470 a, E 471 and E 477) on a single occasion by an adult under the proposedconditions of use would be around 0. 00119 mg, which is about 1, 000 times lower than the proteindoses repo rted to trigger allergic reactions in mustard-allergic individuals (around 1 mg). On the basisof the data presented, the Panel concludes that oral consumption of emulsiﬁers manufactured usingbehenic acid from mustard seeds (E 470 a, E 471 and E 477) are unli kely to trigger an allergic reactionin susceptible individuals (i. e. mustard-allergic individuals) under the proposed conditions of use...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{short-term}} feeding studies was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} biological effects of three <b>behenic</b> medium-chain triglycerides (BMCTs), including caprenin (CAP). All three triglycerides were composed primarily of caprylic (C 8 : 0), capric (ClO:O), and <b>behenic</b> (C 22 :O) acids, although total fatty acids compositions differed slightly. In the first experiment, adult male rats were maintained for 23 days on semipurified diets containing 26 % (wlw) of a BMCT, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil or corn oil. Each triglyceride was assessed for its effects on growth, feed efficiency, calcium and iron balance, fat balance, and carcass fatty acid composition. A 28 -day study of similar design evaluated the nutritive properties of chow diets that were supplemented with 15 % of a BMCT or MCT when consumed by adult male golden Syrian hamsters. Finally, a 28 -day feeding study in weanling male and female rats was conducted to assess the potential oral toxicity of CAP. CAP was administered in semipurified diet at 0, 5, 10, and 15 %. Corn oil was added at 18, 13, 8, and 3 %, respectively, to maintain total dietary fat content at 18 % and provide a source of essential fatty acids. The overall results of these experiments demonstrated that (1) BMCTs, including CAP, provided usable energy to sustain growth in rats and hamsters, although these triglycerides had lower calorie values than typical fats and oils, (2) up to 7542 % of the <b>behenic</b> acid content of BMCTs was unabsorbed by both species and excreted in the feces, (3) increased fecal excretion of BMCT-derived <b>behenic</b> acid did not significantly affect calcium and iron balance in rats, (4) <b>behenic</b> acid was metabolized readily by both rats and hamsters as indicated by recovery of only 3 - 15 % of the absorbed fatty acid in total carcass fat {{at the end of}} the studies, and (5) CAP was nontoxic to rats when consumed for 28 consecutive days at levels of up to 15 % in the diet (83 % of total dietary fat) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of Langmuir monolayers and Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of a semi-fluorinated surfactant containing an intermediate hydrophilic group was investigated. The polar {{group in the}} middle of the molecule is shown to induce different conformational states depending on the substrate. At the air–water interface, the molecule adopts a folded shape in order to present its polar group to the water; this leads to a disordered phase. After transfer onto hydrophilic solid substrate (oxidized silicon wafers covered by a <b>behenic</b> acid bilayer), the molecule adopts a stretched conformation and hexagonal packing. Moreover, observed by atomic force microscopy, this LB film displays a labyrinthine morphology induced by the {{structure of}} the semi-fluorinated molecule. Finally, the influence of the conformational change of this molecule on its miscibility properties with <b>behenic</b> acid is studied...|$|E
40|$|Groundnut is an {{economically}} important oil crop. Main fatty acid {{components of the}} groundnut oil are oleic and linoleic acid, which are useful to human health. Forty five groundnut genotypes were grown at the Jambegede Experimental Farm, Malang, East Java {{during the dry season}} of 2009. Samples of the harvested grains were analyzed for their fatty acid contents at the Food and Technology Laboratory, Gajah Mada University, Yogyakarta in 2009 using gas chromatography. Groundnut cultivar Singa produced the highest pod yield (3. 59 t/ha), followed by cultivars Talam 1 and Gajah (3. 10 t/ha). Fatty acid composition among genotypes varied, ranging from 37. 7 to 45. 7 %. Oleic and linoleic acids were the major fatty acid components, accounting for 70. 8 - 85. 4 % of the total fatty acid contents. The average of oleic, linoleic, palmitic, <b>behenic,</b> and arachidic acid contents was each 37. 7 %, 41. 2 %, 12. 5 %, 3. 6 %, and 3. 0 %, respectively. Genotype MLGA 0261 contained the highest oleic acid (49. 3 %), while MLGA 0077 contained the highest linoleic acid (48. 9 %). Significant negative correlation between oleic acid content with linoleic acid (- 0. 59 **), palmitic acid (- 0. 49 **), and <b>behenic</b> acid (- 0. 45 **) was detected. These correlations indicated that high content of oleic acid would be followed by low linoleic, palmitic, and <b>behenic</b> acids. Based on the fatty acid content, the groundnut genotypes were divided into three groups. Group I contained palmitic, linoleic, and <b>behenic</b> acids above the average. Group II contained oleic and arachidic acids below the average, and Group III contained high oleic acid and low other fatty acids. Cultivars Gajah, Tapir, Turangga, Sima, Singa, Zebra, Panter, Tuban, and Talam 1 were belong to Group I, where as cultivars Badak, Landak, Jerapah, and Kancil were in the Group II, and MLGA 0261 in Group III...|$|E

40|$|We {{have devised}} {{a method of}} making a flat oil/water {{interface}} which remains fiat on inver-sion. Cell adhesion to the interface can be observed microscopically. Glutaraldehyde-fixed human red blood cells adhere to the interface between physiological saline and hexadecane containing surface-active <b>behenic</b> acid at pH values below about 7 - 5. At high pH values, cells are prevented from adhering due to dissociation of the carboxyl groups of <b>behenic</b> acid oriented in the interface. The negative red cells are driven away electrostatically. Adherent and non-adherent cells remain on the aqueous side of the interface and do not appreciably deform it when adherent. Cells are electrostatically attracted to a similar interface containing positively charged octadecyltrimethylammonium ions. Cells also adhere to an inter-face containing octadecanol, which carries no charge. Underlying both electrostatic repulsion and attraction between red cells and oil/water inter-faces is an attractive force which may be of electrodynamic (van der Waals) origin...|$|E
