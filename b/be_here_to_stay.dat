5000|$|As a consequence, {{the shorter}} format makes a project {{potentially}} more affordable for the client/author. Manhattan Literary, a ghostwriting company, states that [...] "book projects on the shorter side, tailored to new markets like the Kindle Singles imprint and others (30,000-42,000 words) start {{at a cost}} of $15,000". And this shorter book appears to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> It was once financially impractical for publishers to produce such novella-length texts (they would have to charge too much); but this new market is, by 2015, already substantial and has been projected to be a solid part of the future of book publishing. So, with its appearance the starting price for the professional book writer has come down by about half, but only if this shorter format makes sense for the client.|$|E

40|$|The Linkspartei is Germany's newest {{political}} party. It {{grew out}} of the predominantly eastern German PDS and the largely western German WASG.

40|$|Biometric {{technologies}} are slowly becoming more commonplace although their growth {{has not been}} as fast as some have predicted. There is a stigma attached to biometrics in that people have an invasive view of the devices.

Either way biometric devices are going to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with the government unveiling plans for its multimillion pound national ID card system, and computer manufacturers integrating it into their hardware.

Five biometric devices were chosen with regards to public availability and cost: Fingerprint recognition. Iris recognition, Facial recognition. Signature recognition and Voice/Speech recognition. Thirty participants were asked to answer questions before and after using the biometric devices to gain an opinion of the technology. The results were analysed and show that around 80 % of participants knew what biometric technologies were. In more depth it can be shown that Fingerprint recognition is the most favoured of the technologies, and that Voice/Speech and Signature are the least liked. 2 School of computin...|$|E

40|$|Although a latecomer, {{economically}} important Asia {{has emerged}} {{at the forefront}} of global free trade agreement (FTA) activity. This has sparked concerns about the negative effects of Asian FTAs, including the "noodle bowl" problem. Amid slow progress in the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Doha negotiations and the global financial crisis, however, Asian regionalism seems to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> The focus for policymakers should then be how best to minimize the costs of FTAs while maximizing their benefits. Adopting a pragmatic perspective, this paper examines key trends and challenges in Asian FTAs. It provides new evidence from firm surveys, analysis of specific agreements, and computable general equilibrium estimates. It provides the following set of recommendations: strengthen the support system for using FTAs; rationalize rules of origin and upgrade their administration; ensure better coverage of agricultural trade; forge comprehensive "WTO-plus" agreements; and encourage a region-wide FTA. Political economy considerations suggest that a likely scenario is for FTA consolidation in Asia [...] by creating a People's Republic of China-Japan-Korea FTA, combining it with ASEANÂ +Â  1 FTAs, and then involving Australia, India, and New Zealand [...] to be followed by connections with North America and Europe.

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{conditions of}} most contemporary surveillance systems {{run counter to}} principles of democratic governance. Because, at its core, surveillance is about control, it tends to produce conditions of constraint, wherein human and technical action is regulated and limited. The degree and kind of constraint {{vary according to the}} values and assumptions that are embedded in respective surveillance apparatuses and generated by surveillance practices. Today’s surveillance systems are inflected by and reproduce neoliberal rationalities of market-based solutions to social problems and disciplinary exclusions of marginalized populations. I develop this argument across three sections. First, I draw upon STS writings on democracy and technology to frame technology as political in its own right, apart from its use by government agencies, corporations, or others. Second, I analyze the dominant functions of surveillance today with regard to the differential treatment and automated control of populations, both of which are functions that produce identities of marginality and resist democratic participation or oversight. Finally, to avoid deterministic conclusions about surveillance, I explore several examples of democratically empowering surveillance systems that encourage openness, transparency, participation, and power equalization among social groups and institutions. Because surveillance societies appear to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> democratic ways of life may depend on tempering the growing hegemony of differential and automated control with alternative, power equalizing forms of surveillance...|$|E
40|$|Speaking {{about racism}} in the western {{political}} climate of {{the first decade of}} the twenty-first century is more difficult than ever before. There is a feeling in post-colonial and post-immigration societies that the blatant overt racism of the past is no longer as pressing. Admitting racism elicits discomfort because common wisdom tells us that racism opposes everything that we believe in as citizens of democratic, "civilised" modern states. Yet state racism appears to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> and, in many ways, is more acceptable than ever before. Immigration detention centres, the deportation of "failed" asylum seekers and "illegal" immigrants, racial profiling and the rolling back of liberties won by the civil rights movement are all examples of how state racism impacts on our daily lives. "Race and State" contributes to breaking the taboo of discussing the links between "race" and state. The papers collected in this book highlight the interconnections between "race" and state, from historical, theoretical or contemporary sociological perspectives. Part I of the book looks at theoretical issues in conceptualising the "race"-state relationship. Part II examines racism in its most pernicious contemporary manifestation: the racialisation of "terror". Part III, on the racial state(s) of Ireland, is an important addition to the debate, examining Ireland as a "test case" for demonstrating and interpreting the relationship between "race" and state...|$|E
