No one witnessed the event, but investigators concluded that the mixer operator had shut off the main breaker and then made a telephone call instead of following the normal procedure for checking the mixer before any one entered it. The victim did not know that the operator had de-energized the mixer at the breaker. Thinking he was turning the mixer off, he activated the <b>breaker</b> <b>switch</b> and energized the mixer. The victim then entered the mixer and began cleaning without first pushing the toggle switch to make sure that the equipment was de-energized.

With the widespread applica-tion of vacuum <b>breakers</b> for transformer <b>switching,</b> recently, this phenomenon {{has been attributed to}} a significant number of trans-former failures. Vacuum circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>switching</b> of electric arc furnace and ladle melt furnace (LMF) transformers raises concern because of their inductive currents. High-frequency transients and overvoltages result when the vacuum breaker exhibits virtual current chop and multiple re-ignitions. This paper will present a detailed case study of vacuum <b>breaker</b> <b>switching</b> of a new LMF transformer involving current chopping and restrike simulations using the electromagnetic transients program. A technique that involves a combination of surge arresters and snubbers will be applied to the LMF to show that the switching transients can be successfully mitigated.

40|$|In {{the island}} wide {{transmission}} network of Ceylon Electricity Board, there are 33 kV <b>Breaker</b> <b>Switch</b> Capacitor Banks at twelve locations {{for improving the}} efficiency and quality of power. The capacitor bank installed at Pannipitiya Grid Substation, which is the highest capacity installed in a grid substation of the CEB network was failed immediately after connecting to the system. Several studies were conducted to identify reasons of the failure. However the final recommendation is still pending. Placement of capacitor banks in a grid substation is a major factor, influencing the reliability and efficient operation of capacitor banks. Therefore, this study was focused on to determine the preferred location of installing capacitor banks in a 220 / 132 / 33 ' kV grid substation. The two of possible locations are at 33 kV tertiary of the power transformers and at the 33 kV load bus. Influences on capacitor banks. under different fault conditions were analyzed in this study, while simulating the grid model built using Simulink in MATLAB program. Positive and negative impacts were found III respect of the two identified locations. • Switching stresses on capacitors of the bank is less when capacitors are installed at tertiary of the power transformers compared to the case when capacitors are at the 33 kV load busbar. • For balance or unbalanced feeder faults, preferred location is the 33 kV load busbar, since voltage and current fluctuations are less {{compared to the other}} location.  In case of lightning strikes at high voltage side, capacitors have less stresses when located at 33 kV load busbar. As such, it is recommended to connect capacitor banks at tertiary of 2201132 / 33 kV transformers of grid substations in industrial areas such as Export processing Zones, because the capacitor banks are subjected to frequent switching due to high load variations of the industrial load. Installation of capacitor banks at 33 kV load busbars is recommended to the grid substations where there are long power transmission lines with frequent feeder faults because such feeder faults have less influence on capacitor banks when they are located at the 33 kV load busbars...|$|E

Almost 80 % of the distribution of electrical power is done by CEB. The transmission network totally owned operated by CEB. The CEB transmission system consists of 220 k V and 132 kV network. It has 44 Grid Substation which convert 132 kV/ 33 kV for the distribution of the power to low voltage consumers. In this Grid Substation there is 109 132 kV/ 33 kV power transformer each having capacity of 31. 5 MVA. There are <b>Breaker</b> <b>switch</b> capacitors (BSC) bank installed at some places of these GSS. The total installed capacity of the shunt BSC bank is amount to 320 MV AR and yet another 70 MV AR planning to connect in the near future. In these GSS there are two systems to control 33 kV bus voltage at reference 33 kV level. One system varies the transformer tap position by controlling 33 kV voltage. We called this as. On-Load Tap Control of the transformer. For this to be done there is controller (AVR) which sends the command to OLTC to take appropriate action of increasing or decreasing the tap. On the other hand there is a BSC bank which allowed controlling the reactive power of the GSS. The main intentions of the use of capacitor banks is to give voltage support at the substation level, reduction of losses in power transformers and transmission lines, and to release the capacity constraints in transformers and lines. CEB uses power factor regulation for switching these capacitor banks for above purposes but no studies have been done to evaluate its suitability with transformer AVR. Even though these two controllers try to maintain VAR and Voltage (Q&V) of the GSS they are operating independently. Because of that We could not achieved maximum effect of these two system i:e., under optimization of the Voltage and Var. Some time we have observed that these two controllers are hunting with each other by doing the controlling. If we could coordinate these two controllers to make proper function we indirectly could save the number of tap operations of the transformer and that will help reducing costly maintenance of the OLTC. My main intention is to coordinate these two controllers to achieve above objects. I further try to develop a new system {{to take care of the}} both functions in one unit.

These publications present the power losses of electrical devices at rated loads in tables. In this thesis, the models for electrical devices are created and used, instead of tables, to estimate power losses. The use of curve fit models presents a convenience in calculation of power losses. <b>Breaker,</b> fusible <b>switch,</b> and motor starter power losses presented by McDonald & Hickok (1985) and Rubin (1979) were updated using manufacturer published data, technical papers, industrial standards, and test samples. Test, manufacturer, and analytical model data are collected and power loss curve fit models are created for <b>breakers,</b> fusible <b>switches,</b> motor starters, and bus bars with enclosures. The panelboard power loss is calculated as the sum of partial power losses of the component electrical equipment, i. e. <b>breakers,</b> fusible <b>switches,</b> motor starters, and bus bars with enclosures used in power panelboards.

40|$|Switching of shunt {{reactors}} and {{capacitor banks}} {{is known to}} cause a very high rate of rise of transient recovery voltage across the circuit breaker contacts. With improvements in circuit breaker technology, modern SF 6 puffer circuits have been designed with less interrupter per pole than previous generations of SF 6 circuit breakers. This has caused modern circuit breakers to operate with higher voltage stress in the dielectric recovery region after current interruption. Catastrophic failures of modern SF 6 circuit breakers have been reported during shunt reactor and capacitor bank de-energisation. In those cases, evidence of cumulative re-strikes {{has been found to}} be the main cause of interrupter failure. Monitoring of voltage waveforms during switching would provide information about the magnitude and frequency of small re-ignitions and re-strikes. However, measuring waveforms at a moderately high frequency require plant outages to connect equipment. In recent years, there have been increasing interests in using RF measurements in condition monitoring of switchgear. The RF measurement technique used for measuring circuit <b>breaker</b> inter-pole <b>switching</b> time during capacitor bank closing is of particular interest.
