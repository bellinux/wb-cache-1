40|$|The {{need for}} {{protecting}} rights over relational data is of ever increasing concern. There {{have recently been}} some pioneering works in this area. In this paper, we propose an effective fingerprinting scheme {{based on the idea}} of block method in the area of multimedia fingerprinting. The scheme ensures that certain <b>bit</b> <b>positions</b> of the data contain specific values. The <b>bit</b> <b>positions</b> are determined by the keys known only to the owner of the data and different buyers of the database have different <b>bit</b> <b>positions</b> and different specific values for those <b>bit</b> <b>positions.</b> The detection of the fingerprint can be completed even with a small subset of a marked relation in case that the sample contains the fingerprint. Our extensive analysis shows that the proposed scheme is robust against various forms of attacks, including adding, deleting, shuffling or modifying tuples or attributes and colluding with other recipients of a relation, and ensures the integrity of relation at the same time...|$|R

2500|$|A {{hypercube}} graph, {{in which}} the vertices correspond to all possible k-bit bitvectors and in which two vertices are adjacent when the corresponding bitvectors differ in only a single bit, is a special case of a k-dimensional grid graph and is therefore a median graph. [...] The median of three bitvectors a, b, and c may be calculated by computing, in each <b>bit</b> <b>position,</b> the majority function of the bits of a, b, and c. [...] Since median graphs are closed under retraction, and include the hypercubes, every retract of a hypercube is a median graph.|$|E
2500|$|Example 2. All bit vectors {{of a given}} length form a Boolean algebra [...] "pointwise", {{meaning that}} any n-ary Boolean {{operation}} {{can be applied to}} n bit vectors one <b>bit</b> <b>position</b> at a time. For example, the ternary OR of three bit vectors each of length 4 is the bit vector of length 4 formed by oring the three bits {{in each of the four}} bit positions, thus 0100∨1000∨1001= 1101. Another example is the truth tables above for the n-ary operations, whose columns are all the bit vectors of length 2n and which therefore can be combined pointwise whence the n-ary operations form a Boolean algebra.|$|E
50|$|To {{reduce the}} {{computation}} time, engineers devised faster ways to add two binary numbers by using carry-lookahead adders.They work by creating two signals (P and G) for each <b>bit</b> <b>position,</b> {{based on whether}} a carry is propagated through from a less significant <b>bit</b> <b>position</b> (at least one input is a 1), generated in that <b>bit</b> <b>position</b> (both inputs are 1), or killed in that <b>bit</b> <b>position</b> (both inputs are 0). In most cases, P is simply the sum output of a half adder and G is the carry output of the same adder. After P and G are generated, the carries for every <b>bit</b> <b>position</b> are created. Some advanced carry-lookahead architectures are the Manchester carry chain, Brent-Kung adder, and the Kogge-Stone adder.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an extensive experimental study of bit-flip errors in instruction set architecture registers and main memory locations. Comprising more than two million fault injection experiments conducted with thirteen benchmark programs, the study provides insights on whether it is necessary to consider double bit-flip errors in dependability benchmarking experiments. The results show that the proportion of silent data corruptions in the program output, is almost the same for single and double bit errors. In addition, we present detailed statistics about the error sensitivity of different target registers and memory locations, including <b>bit</b> <b>positions</b> within registers and memory words. These show that the error sensitivity varies significantly between different <b>bit</b> <b>positions</b> and registers. An important observation is that injections in certain <b>bit</b> <b>positions</b> always have the same impact regardless of when the error is injected...|$|R

40|$|To {{be able to}} {{transmit}} television pictures in a digital form through a medium having a limited bandwidth, the pictures are subjected to picture transform and to variable-length coding. The picture to be transmitted is converted in this manner into a bit stream comprising code words of variable length. This bit stream is converted into a channel bit stream which is less sensitive to transmission errors. To this end the most significant code words (representing the average luminance and the coarse picture details) of sub-pictures of 8 * 8 pixels are accommodated at fixed <b>bit</b> <b>positions</b> of the channel bit stream. These code words can be retrieved by simple count-down of the <b>bit</b> <b>positions.</b> The other code words are distributed over the other <b>bit</b> <b>positions.</b> The decoder is relatively simple because the length of each block comprising significant code words is also transmitted.
