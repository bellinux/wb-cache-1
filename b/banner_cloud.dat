5000|$|When {{there is}} a high wind, a <b>banner</b> <b>cloud</b> is formed {{downwind}} of the upper slopes of isolated, steep-sided mountains. It is created by the low pressure areas in the downwind vortices drawing in relatively humid air from the lower slopes of the mountain. This reduction in pressure compared to the surrounding air increases condensation, {{in the same manner as}} an aircraft's wingtip vortices. The most famous such cloud forms routinely in the lee of the Matterhorn.|$|E
40|$|Systematic {{observations}} of banner clouds at Mount Zugspitze in the Bavarian Alps are presented and discussed. One set of observations draws on daily time lapse movies, which were taken {{over several years}} at this mountain. Identifying banner clouds {{with the help of}} these movies and using simultaneous {{observations of}} standard variables at the summit of the mountain provides climatological information regarding the banner clouds. In addition, a week-long measurement campaign with an entire suite of instruments was carried through yielding a comprehensive set of data for two specific <b>banner</b> <b>cloud</b> events. The duration of <b>banner</b> <b>cloud</b> events has a long-tailed distribution with a mean of about 40 min. The probability of occurrence has both a distinct diurnal and a distinct seasonal cycle, with a maximum in the afternoon and in the warm season, respectively. These cycles appear to correspond closely to analogous cycles of relative humidity, which maximize in the late afternoon and during the warm season. In addition, the dependence of <b>banner</b> <b>cloud</b> occurrence on wind speed is weak. Both results suggest that moisture conditions are a key factor for <b>banner</b> <b>cloud</b> occurrence. The distribution of wind direction during <b>banner</b> <b>cloud</b> events slightly deviates from climatology, suggesting an influence from the specific Zugspitz orography. The two <b>banner</b> <b>cloud</b> events during the campaign have a number of common features: the windward and the leeward side are characterized by different wind regimes, however, with mean upward flow on both sides; the leeward air is both moister and warmer than the windward air; the background atmosphere has an inversion just above the summit of Mt. Zugspitze; the lifting condensation level increases with altitude. The results are discussed, and it is argued that they are consistent with previous Large Eddy Simulations using idealized orography...|$|E
25|$|The Matterhorn is an {{isolated}} mountain. Because of {{its position on}} the main Alpine watershed and its great height, the Matterhorn is exposed to rapid weather changes. In addition, the steep faces of the mountain and its isolated location make it prone to <b>banner</b> <b>clouds</b> formation, with the air flowing around the mountain producing condensation of the air on the lee side and also creating vortices.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Banner</b> <b>clouds</b> {{appear on}} the leeward side of a {{mountain}} and resemble a banner or a flag. This article provides a comprehensive definition of “banner clouds”. It is based primarily on an extensive collection of time lapse movies, but previous attempts at an explanation of this phenomenon are also taken into account. The following ingredients are considered essential: the cloud must be attached to the mountain but not {{appear on the}} windward side; the cloud must originate from condensation of water vapour contained in the air (rather than consist of blowing snow); the cloud must be persistent; and the cloud must not be of convective nature. The definition is illustrated and discussed with the help of still images and time lapse movies taken at Mount Zugspitze in the Bavarian Alps...|$|R

EuroSat Rapidscan images indicated a stationary and persistent cloud edge along the lee of the Massif Central. The cloud edge marks the beginning of mistral ow acceleration and descent according to COAMPS simulations.

40|$|The Nordic seas region, due to {{its unique}} {{geographical}} and climatological conditions, experiences a number of adverse mesoscale weather events that have proven fatal for human activities in the area. Most of these weather events occur in the winter season and include orography-induced wind extremes, shallow and sharp fronts that often form {{in the vicinity of}} the ice edge and intense storms called polar lows. In order to assess such high impact weather conditions, a field campaign was conducted over the Nordic seas in February-March 2008 as part of the IPY-THORPEX project. During this field campaign, measurements of a number of severe weather cases were collected through the dropsonde and lidar sensors on-board the DLR-FALCON aircraft. This thesis deals with high resolution modeling experiments of some of the cases observed during the IPY-THORPEX field campaign, with focus on the sensitivity of these events to underlying surface conditions and several physical factors. The results of these experiments are presented in the form of three scientific articles. Paper-I presents the airborne measurements of a case with strong gap winds observed at the exit region of the Hinlopen Strait in Svalbard archipelago. The DLRFALCON aircraft flew along the Hinlopen strait and recorded winds of strength ~ 20 ms− 1, which was about four times higher than the upstream wind, near to the surface. In addition, formation of a wake with return currents in the lee of the terrain was also recorded by the lidar sensors carried by the aircraft. This case was simulated in a fineresolution numerical model with a high degree of accuracy. The simulations showed the existence of small-scale <b>cloud</b> <b>banners</b> extending downstream of the lee of the mountains. The causal mechanisms for such cloud features were investigated through an idealised approach. The ideal experiments indicated that the vertical circulations set up by the terrain features cause the <b>cloud</b> <b>banners</b> and a relatively warm ocean surface maintains them by supplying moisture and buyoancy. In paper-II, numerical simulations of another adverse weather case occurred during the IPY-THORPEX field campaign is described. The simulations indicated the formation of a low pressure system at the surface over the Barents Sea on 29 February 2008. Later on, the low intensified while propagating in a northwestward direction and crossed the ice-edge on 1 March followed by its dissipation. The sensitivity of this surface low to underlying surface conditions is explored in two sensitivity experiments, wherein the ice-cover was removed in the first and the sea-surface temperature was raised by 5 K in the second. The Barents Sea surface low persists for a longer duration in the no-ice experiment but eventually dissolves, perhaps due to high static stability in the region. In the second experiment with warmer sea-surface temperature, the surface low is found to persist near the Svalbard archipelago, leading to a significant advection of cold and stable Arctic air over to the warmer Norwegian Sea. This situation triggers an intense polar low over the Norwegian Sea. Certain dynamical aspects of this polar low are also presented in this paper. The sensitivity of polar lows to upper-level features and important physical factors such as static stability, baroclinicity and surface heating is the subject of paper-III. The study was carried out in a numerically set idealised baroclinic channel with a horizontal grid spacing of 10 km. The formation of polar lows was forced in the channel by imposing a finite amplitude perturbation at the tropopause level at the initial conditions. A number of sensitivity experiments were conducted, each with a different set of initial conditions that differ in the degree of baroclinicity, static stability, surface heating and the scale of upper-level perturbation. This paper shows that the pattern of the vertical motion associated with a polar low is highly sensitive to the amount of baroclinicity and surface heating. Static stability appears to have more profound influence on the growth rate of the polar low than on the associated vertical motion. The structure and scale of the polar low happens to be directly proportional to the features of upper-level perturbation...|$|R
