Positive, 10 X enlargements were produced of spectral bands 4, 6, and 7, for a portion of photo 1033 - 21020. Adequate detail remained to recognize physical features such as streams, glaciers, ice, and snow. Also the entire image was studied using transparencies produced by the 3 M color-key process. A combination of three complementary color combinations produced visually recognizable shades apparently indicating vegetation differences. Also lakes and glacial streams of sufficient size, ice and snow, and drainage patterns can be recognized.

Planktic foraminiferal species diversity was reduced by more than 50 %, with assemblages dominated (60 ^ 90 %) by the opportunistic blooms of the disaster species Guembelitria cretacea, which mimic the early Danian. The prolonged breakdown in productivity occurred during a time of tectonic activity and increased terrestrial runoff that may have resulted in highly eutrophic waters, coupled with a sea-level regression (65. 5 Ma) that led to restricted circulation. Increased productivity during the short climate warming between 65. 4 and 65. 2 Ma is associated with increased species diversity, abundant rugoglobigerinids and common heterohelicids. At the end of the Maastrichtian, decreased productivity coincided with the K/T impact and mass extinction, followed by characteristically early Danian low diversity assemblages. The similarity of the late Maastrichtian and post-K/T impact Guembelitria-dominated assemblages reveals that the planktic foraminiferal response to the K/T catastrophe was not unique, but followed a predictable pattern of response to severe environmental perturbations...|$|E
40|$|The {{main issue}} of this report is {{comparison}} and verification of long wave models with emphasis on variable depth effects. A selection of dispersive long wave theories are reviewed. Included are the so-called standard Boussinesq equations and the much celebrated counterpart where the velocities are prescribed at an optimal vertical position, namely at 0. 531 times the depth down from the equilibrium surface. The latter option, referred to as improved Boussinesq equations, displays substantially improved dispersion properties on constant depth. We also address formulations with the velocity potential as primary unknown and where approximations linked to a mild bottom slope have been invoked. One of the potential formulations are modified in a very simple way to yield dispersion properties equal to the "improved Boussinesq equations". First the different Boussinesq models are assessed for constant depth propagation. Then testing is extended to wave motion in an idealized bathymetry with two horizontal planes joined by a smooth slope. The length of the waves incident on the slope {{as well as the}} slope steepness are systematically varied. It turns out that the new potential formulation, with improved dispersion properties, performs well even in presence of steep <b>bottom</b> <b>gradients...</b>|$|R

40|$|Receiver {{functions}} {{from three}} 30 -station IRIS-PASSCAL small-aperture arrays (2 – 15 km station spacing) operated for 10 months {{each in the}} northern Rocky Mountains show a ubiquitous negative polarity P to S conversion just preceding the 410 -km discontinuity arrival. Data from the three arrays were sorted into NW, SE, and SW back-azimuth quadrants and stacked to form nine quadrant stacks. Remarkably, the negative polarity arrival (NPA) is apparent in 8 of the 9 quadrant stacks, with 7 of the 8 having well-correlated waveforms. Each quadrant stack also contains clear P to S conversions from the 410 - and 660 -km discontinuities. Moveout analysis shows that all the major phases display the correct moveout for forward scattered P-S phases. The waveshapes for the seven similar NPA- 410 km discontinuity arrivals are modeled with a five-parameter “double gradient slab” model that is parameterized as follows: a top gradient thickness and shear velocity decrease; a constant velocity layer; <b>bottom</b> <b>gradient</b> thickness; and shear velocity increase. Model misfit is assessed via a grid search over the model space using a reflectivity code to calculate synthetic seismograms. Model likelihood is determined by calculating 1 - and 2 -D marginal probability density functions (PDF) for the five parameters. The 1 -D marginals display a range of peak values, although significant overlap is observed for the top gradient thickness and its associated velocity decrement. From the peak value of the summary PDF, we find the top velocity gradient to be sharp (s). Defining an effective thickness of the low-velocity layer as the mean layer thickness plus half the mean gradient thicknesses, the 410 low-velocity layer thickness {{is found to be}} 22 km.

These arrivals are modeled as a low-velocity layer atop the 410 km discontinuity (410 -LVL) and are inverted for a velocity profile via a grid search using a five-parameter linear gradient velocity model. Model parameter likelihood and correlations are assessed via calculation of one- and two-dimensional marginal posterior probability distributions. The maximum likelihood model parameter values found are top velocity gradient thickness of 0. 0 km with a 4. 6 % (− 0. 22 km/s) shear velocity reduction, a 19. 8 km constant velocity layer, and <b>bottom</b> <b>gradient</b> thickness of 25. 0 km with a 3. 5 % (+ 0. 17 km/s) shear velocity increase. The estimated mean thickness of the 410 -LVL is 32. 3 km. The top gradient of the 410 -LVL is sharp within vertical resolution limits of P to S conversion (km), and the diffuse 410 km velocity gradient is consistent with hydration of the olivine-wadsleyite phase transformation. The 410 -LVL is interpreted as a melt layer created by the Transition Zone Water Filter model. Two secondary observations are found: (1) the 410 -LVL is absent from the SE end of the array and (2) an intermittent negative polarity P 525 s arrival is observed. We speculate that upper mantle shear velocity anomalies above the 410 km discontinuity may manifest Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities nucleated from the 410 -LVL melt layer that are being shed upward on time scales of {{tens of millions of}} years...|$|E

Movements of 29 white crappies (271 – 352 mm total length) increased atdusk, peaked at night, declined at dawn, and remained low throughout the day. Day and nightmovements averaged 17 and 47 m/h in 1988 and 9 and 28 m/h in 1989, respectively. Movementwas significantly greater (P. 0. 05) between 2200 and 0200 hours {{than it was}} for all time periodsbetween 0600 and 2000 hours in 1988 and between 0800 and 2200 hours in 1989. Peakmovements occurred when measurable light intensity approached zero. Greater movements alsooccurred during times of high barometric pressure and during times of little change in barometricpressure. Transmitter signal strength, calibrated to estimate fish depth, indicated that whitecrappies were generally deeper during the day (5. 4 m) than at night (4. 3 m). Ten high-use areaswere mapped.

40|$|In coastal areas, the {{propagation}} of wind waves is highly dependent on the bathymetry and the hydrodynamics. The presence of bottom enhances the frictional dissipation of wave energy, wave breaking, high harmonic generation, and wave refraction. The refraction induced by an irregular (and time varying) bathymetry {{may lead to a}} number of processes (e. g. convergence or divergence of energy, cross-wave conditions, etc.) and controls the spatial distribution of wave heights. Similarly, the bathymetry dominates the hydrodynamic evolution and shortens the time and spatial scales of variability of the flow. Like <b>bottom</b> <b>gradients,</b> the horizontal current shear may induce a refraction effect on the waves. In the present study, a series of numerical results on the tide/surge/current effect on waves in the Belgian coastal area are presented. It is shown that the inclusion of an inhomogeneous and unsteady current field in the computation of waves modifies the spatial distribution of significant wave heights. Differences of significant wave height in the order of 10 % are observed when current and time varying depth are included in the computation. Increasing from the standard 30 degree directional resolution to 10 degree directional resolution (which is considered to account for the complex bathymetry) has a similar impact on the energy distribution in the coastal area. At specific locations (Westhinder and Bol van Heist), qualitative and quantitative agreement is improved when the coupled system is used...|$|R
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} morphodynamic {{model is}} analysed to gain fundamental {{knowledge about the}} initial growth and long-term behaviour of observed shoreface-connected sand ridges. Themodel describes quasi-steady, depth-averaged flow on a storm-dominated inner shelf with an erodible bottom and a transverse slope. Both bed load and suspended load sediment transport are incorporated. The formulations are linear {{with respect to the}} current and account for depth dependent stirring of sediment by waves {{as well as for the}} effect of local bed slopes. A linear stability analysis has already revealed the initial growth of bed forms that resemble observed shoreface-connected ridges. Here, a nonlinear analysis is carried out to study the long-term dynamics of these bed forms. The method is based on an expansion of the flow and the bottom perturbations in a truncated series of eigenfunctions of the linear problemfor a coastal stretch with a fixed longshore length. The result is a set of nonlinear algebraic equations, describing the flow over the topography, and differential equations for the bottom amplitudes. Results indicate finite-amplitude behaviour in the mode amplitudes. The long-term bottom pattern shows the observed asymmetries of the ridges with steep <b>bottom</b> <b>gradients</b> on the downstream side. The migration speed of this finite-amplitude perturbation appears to be unaffected by nonlinear effects. Extrapolation of the results to Long Island shelf yields bed forms with a characteristic height of about 4 m in a saturation time of B 850 yr; which are consistent with observations.

40|$|We {{describe}} experimental {{observations of}} fully developed, large-amplitude bars under {{the action of}} a shearing fluid. The experiments were performed in an annular tank filled with water and sheared above by a steady motor source. The same steady shearing flow can produce {{a variety of different}} erodible bed manifestations: advective or precessive bars, which refer to bar structures with global regularity and a near-steady precession velocity; interactive bars, the structure of which depends on local rearrangements, which are in turn a response to complex background topography; and dispersive bars, which are created when an initially isolated mound of sand evolves into a train of sand ripples. Of these, the most amenable to analysis are the precessive bars. For precession bars, we find that the skin depth, which is the nondimensionalized mean-field transport rate, grows exponentially {{as a function of the}} shear velocity. From this, we arrive at an analytical expression that approximates the precession speed of the bars as a function of shear velocity. We use this to obtain a formula for sediment transport rate. However, in intense flows, the bars can get large engendering boundary layer separation, leading to a different dynamic for bar formation and evolution. Numerical flow calculations over an experimentally obtained set of precessive bars are presented and show that classical parametrizations of mass flux in terms of <b>bottom</b> <b>gradients</b> have shortcomings. Within the range of shear rates considered, a quantity that does not change appreciably in time is the aspect ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the average bar amplitude, with respect to a mean depth, to the average bar length. © 2011 American Physical Society...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} {{habitat of}} cetaceans occurring along the continental slope {{in the western}} Ligurian Sea was investigated. Data were collected from two different sighting platforms, {{one of the two}} being a whale-watching boat. Surveys, conducted from May to October and from 1996 to 2000, covered an area of approximately 3000 km 2 with a mean effort of about 10, 000 km year- 1. A total of 814 sightings was reported, including all the species occurring in the area: Stenella coeruleoalba, Balaenoptera physalus, Physeter macrocephalus, Globicephala melas, Grampus griseus, Ziphius cavirostris, Tursiops truncatus, Delphinus delphis. A Geographic Information System was used to integrate sighting data to a set of environmental characteristics, which included <b>bottom</b> <b>gradient,</b> area between different isobaths, and length and linearity of the isobaths within a cell unit. Habitat use was analysed by means of a multi-dimensional scaling, MDS, analysis. Significant differences were found in the habitat preference of most of the species regularly occurring in the area. Bottlenose dolphin, Risso's dolphin, sperm whale and Cuvier's beaked whale were found strongly associated to well-defined depth and slope gradient characteristics of the shelf-edge and the upper and lower slope. The hypothesis of habitat segregation was considered for Risso's dolphin, sperm whale and Cuvier's beaked whale. Canonical discriminant functions using depth and slope as predictors outlined clear and not overlapping habitat preferences for Risso's dolphin and Cuvier's beaked whale, whereas a partial overlapping of the habitat of the other two species was observed for sperm whale. Such a partitioning of the upper and lower slope area {{may be the result of}} the common feeding habits and suggests a possible competition of these three species. A temporal segregation in the use of the slope area was also observed for sperm whales and Risso's dolphins. Fin whales, and the occasionally encountered common dolphin and long-finned pilot whales showed a generic preference for the pelagic area. In contrast, striped dolphins were generically found in any type of physical habitat, in agreement with their known opportunistic feeding habits. Interannual and seasonal movements were observed in fin whales and in all the other regularly occurring species, indicating that changes in the environmental and climatological conditions have a remarkable influence on habitat use. Finally, a relationship between group size and habitat use was observed for the species known to forage in groups. This relationship suggests that these species respond to environmental variability either by moving within the study area or by behavioural changes that may reflect changes in the preference for prey item...|$|E

In this report a {{simulation}} oftests with submerged breakwaters, parallel to the shoreline, in a wave basin, are carried out with the morphodynamic model Delft 2 D-MOR. This 2 -dimensional horizontal model was developed by DELFT HYDRAULICS. The aim of this thesis is to find out whether and how this model is able to simulate these tests with submerged breakwaters, and to investigate the effects of these breakwaters on profile development. The conditions ofthe experiments are used as input for the model. One simulation without breakwaters and two simulations with different breakwater configurations are carried out. Comparison of model results with measurement data rom the experiments shows that the model is able to simulate some hydrodynamic and morphological processes induced by the submerged breakwaters. Wave heights in the vicinity ofthe obstacles are reduced because of wave dissipation over the breakwaters. Flow circulation patterns occur induced by water level gradients. Sediment is mainly transported from behind the breakwaters towards and through the gaps seaward. However, there are still quite some differences between model and experimental results. Large amounts of sediment are eroded near the shoreline and close behind the breakwaters, which was not measured during the experiments. Apparently inaccuracies in modelling appear at the boundary of sea and land (original dry points remain dry, <b>bottom</b> <b>gradients</b> are irrealistic large), and at the location of submerged breakwaters where the modelling ofwave behaviour is not adequate. Also problems with resolution of computational grid arise at the location of submerged breakwaters. A higher resolution is needed in order to compute realistic flow velocities close behind the submerged breakwaters. Obviously a lot ofwork has to be done to improve the 2 DH model results such that it can be a useful tooI for modelling the effects of submerged breakwaters on a beach profile.

40|$|A simple {{conceptual}} model (SCM) for the net transport of suspended sediments {{associated with a}} simple harmonic tidal current superimposed on a spatially varying, wind-wave-induced near-bottom concentration is developed. Because the SCM accounts for {{the response of the}} sediment concentration in the water column to the varying near-bottom concentration, it predicts a net transport rate which is proportional to and in the downward direction of the imposed <b>bottom</b> concentration <b>gradient,</b> i. e. expressible as a diffusive process. In view of its extreme simplicity, which allows for a closed form analytical solution for the apparent diffusivity, the predictions of the SCM are shown to be (surprisingly) accurate by comparison with predicted net transport rates afforded by the numerical solution of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM). Furthermore, the transport rate predicted by the SCM is found to be of comparable magnitude to the long-term average transport rate predicted by conventional equilibrium-based modeling of suspended transport of very fine sediment for a site on the Northern California shelf. Since the diffusive transport mechanism identified and quantified in this paper is entirely missed by equilibrium-based models for suspended sediment transport, the results obtained here strongly suggest the necessity to properly account for non-equilibrium effects when modeling suspended sediment transport in coastal waters.

In particular, the existence of the long- and short-wave cutoffs is found to be very sensitive to boundary conditions, both for the sloping topography and the Ekman pumping. It is suggested that any cutoffs for the growth rate in an Eady-like problem actually result from the chosen boundary conditions.

The present work will firstly deal with the elaboration of a semi-implicit numerical scheme for flows in open channels with arbitrary cross-sections that conserves both the volume and the momentum or the energy head of the fluid, {{in such a way that}} its numerical solutions present the same characteristics as the physical solutions of the problem considered. The semi-implicit discretization in time leads to a relatively simple and computationally efficient scheme whose stability can be shown to be independent from the wave celerity √gH. The conservation properties allow dealing properly with problems presenting discontinuities in the solution, resulting for example from sharp <b>bottom</b> <b>gradients</b> and hydraulic jumps. The conservation of mass is particularly important when the channel has a non rectangular cross-section. The numerical method will be therefore extended to the simulation of closed channel flows in case of free-surface, pressurized and transition flows. The accuracy of the proposed method will be controlled by the use of appropriate flux limiting functions in the discretization of the advective terms, especially in the case of large gradients of the physical quantities involved in the problem. In the particular case of closed channel flows, a new flux limiter will be defined in order to better represent the transitions between free-surface and pressurized flows. The numerical solution, at every time step, will be determined by solving a mildly non-linear system of equations that becomes linear in the particular case that the channel has a rectangular cross-section. Careful physical and mathematical considerations about the stability of the method and the solvability of the system with respect to the implemented boundary conditions will be also provided. The study of the existence and uniqueness of the solution requires the solution of a constrained problem, where the constraint expresses that the feasible solutions are physically meaningful and present a non-negative water depth. From this analysis, it will follow an explicit (dependent only on known quantities) and sufficient condition for the time step to ensure the non-negativity of the water volume. This condition is valid in almost all the physical situations without more restrictive assumptions than those necessary for a correct description of the physical problem. Two suitable solution procedures, the Newton Method and the conjugate gradient method, will be introduced, adapted and studied for the mildly non linear system arising in the solution of the numerical model. Several applications will be presented in order to compare the numerical results with those available from the literature or with analytical and experimental solutions. They will illustrate the properties of the present method in terms of stability, accuracy and efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Transport of {{contaminants}} through clays {{is characterized by}} a very low dispersivity, but depends on the sensitivity of its intrinsic permeability to the contaminant’s concentration. An additional constitutive relationship for a variable intrinsic permeability is thus adopted leading to a coupled system of equations for diffusive–advective transport in multicomponent liquid. A one-dimensional transport problem is solved using finite difference and Newton–Raphson procedure for nonlinear algebraic equations. The results indicate that although diffusion contributes to an increase of transport with respect to pure advection, the flux ultimately depends on end boundary conditions for concentration which, if low, may actually slow down the evolution of concentration and thus of permeability. Indeed, the advective component of flux may still remain secondary if the end portion of the layer remains unaffected by high concentrations. With no constraints on concentration at the <b>bottom</b> (zero concentration <b>gradient</b> boundary condition) and high concentration applied at the top, a significant shortening of the breakthrough time occurs...|$|R
