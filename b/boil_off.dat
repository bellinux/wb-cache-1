5|$|The largest KBOs, such as Pluto and Quaoar, have {{surfaces}} rich in volatile compounds such as methane, {{nitrogen and}} carbon monoxide; {{the presence of}} these molecules is likely due to their moderate vapor pressure in the 30–50K temperature range of the Kuiper belt. This allows them to occasionally <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> their surfaces and then fall again as snow, whereas compounds with higher boiling points would remain solid. The relative abundances of these three compounds in the largest KBOs is directly related to their surface gravity and ambient temperature, which determines which they can retain. Water ice has been detected in several KBOs, including members of the Haumea family such as , mid-sized objects such as 38628 Huya and 20000 Varuna, and also on some small objects. The presence of crystalline ice on large and mid-sized objects, including 50000 Quaoar where ammonia hydrate has also been detected, may indicate past tectonic activity aided by melting point lowering due to the presence of ammonia.|$|E
25|$|Vaporizer: A {{vaporizer}} is {{a device}} used to sublimate the active ingredients of plant material. Rather than burning the herb, which produces potentially irritating, toxic, or carcinogenic by-products; a vaporizer heats {{the material in}} a partial vacuum so that the active compounds contained in the plant <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> into a vapor. This method is often preferable when medically administrating the smoke substance, as opposed to directly pyrolyzing the plant material.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, higher {{volumetric}} {{energy density}} liquid hydrogen or slush hydrogen may be used. However, liquid hydrogen is cryogenic and boils at 20.268K (–252.882°C or –423.188°F). Cryogenic storage cuts weight but requires large liquification energies. The liquefaction process, involving pressurizing and cooling steps, is energy intensive. The liquefied hydrogen has lower energy density by volume than gasoline by approximately {{a factor of}} four, because of the low density of liquid hydrogen — there is actually more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116grams) than there is in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71grams). Liquid hydrogen storage tanks must also be well insulated to minimize <b>boil</b> <b>off.</b> Ice may form around the tank and help corrode it further if the liquid hydrogen tank insulation fails.|$|E
25|$|Liquid {{hydrogen}} or slush hydrogen may be used, {{as in the}} Space Shuttle. However {{liquid hydrogen}} requires cryogenic storage and boils around 20.268 K (−252.882°C or −423.188°F). Hence, its liquefaction imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it down to that temperature). The tanks must also be well insulated to prevent <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> but adding insulation increases cost. Liquid hydrogen has less energy density by volume than hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline by approximately a factor of four. This highlights the density problem for pure hydrogen: there is actually about 64% more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116grams hydrogen) than there is in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71grams hydrogen). The carbon in the gasoline also contributes to the energy of combustion.|$|E
25|$|In the Changing World Technologies (CWT) process, the {{feedstock}} {{material is}} first ground into small chunks, and mixed with water {{if it is}} especially dry. It is then fed into a pressure vessel reaction chamber where it is heated at constant volume to around 250 °C. Similar to a pressure cooker (except at much higher pressure), steam naturally raises the pressure to 600 psi (4 MPa) (near the point of saturated water). These conditions are held for approximately 15 minutes to fully heat the mixture, after which the pressure is rapidly released to <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> most of the water (see: Flash evaporation). The result {{is a mix of}} crude hydrocarbons and solid minerals. The minerals are removed, and the hydrocarbons are sent to a second-stage reactor where they are heated to 500°C, further breaking down the longer hydrocarbon chains. The hydrocarbons are then sorted by fractional distillation, in a process similar to conventional oil refining.|$|E

50|$|The A-type package boiler has two water {{drums and}} one steam drum {{compared}} to the D-type package boiler. Water <b>boils</b> <b>off</b> in the water drums shared by a common header, then sent up the generating tubes, into the steam drum and up the dry pipe.

A-type package boilers were designed to improve package boiler reliability and reduce tube replacements.

2500|$|The insulation, as {{efficient}} as it is, will not keep LNG cold enough by itself. [...] Inevitably, heat leakage will warm and vapourise the LNG. [...] Industry practice is to store LNG as a boiling cryogen. [...] That is, the liquid is stored at its boiling point for the pressure at which it is stored (atmospheric pressure). [...] As the vapour boils off, heat for the phase change cools the remaining liquid. [...] Because the insulation is very efficient, only a relatively small amount of <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> is necessary to maintain temperature. [...] This phenomenon is also called auto-refrigeration.|$|E

2500|$|Simulation work {{published}} in 2005 by Robin Canup suggested that Charon {{could have been}} formed by a collision around 4.5 billion years ago, much like Earth and the Moon. In this model, a large Kuiper belt object struck Pluto at high velocity, destroying itself and blasting off much of Pluto's outer mantle, and Charon coalesced from the debris. However, such an impact should result in an icier Charon and rockier Pluto than scientists have found. It is now thought that Pluto and Charon might have been two bodies that collided before going into orbit about each other. The collision would have been violent enough to <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> volatile ices like methane (...) but not violent enough to have destroyed either body. The very similar density of Pluto and Charon implies that the parent bodies were not fully differentiated when the impact occurred.|$|E

50|$|<b>Boil</b> <b>off</b> rate {{is governed}} by heat leakage and by the {{quantity}} of propellant in the tanks. With partially filled tanks, the percentage loss is higher. Heat leakage depends on surface area, while the original mass of propellant in the tanks depends on volume. So by the cube-square law, the smaller the tank, the faster the liquids will boil off.Some propellant tank designs have achieved a liquid hydrogen <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> rate as low as approximately 0.13% per day (3.8% per month) while the much higher temperature cryogenic fluid of liquid oxygen would <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> much less, about 0.016% per day (0.49% per month).|$|E
