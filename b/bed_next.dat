5|$|Myra Hindley {{was born}} in Crumpsall on 23 July 1942 and raised in Gorton, then a working-class area of Manchester. Her parents, Nellie and Bob Hindley (the latter an alcoholic), beat her {{regularly}} as a young child. The small house the family lived in was in such poor condition that Hindley and her parents had {{to sleep in the}} only available bedroom, she in a single <b>bed</b> <b>next</b> to her parents' double. The family's living conditions deteriorated further when Hindley's sister, Maureen, {{was born in}} August 1946. About a year after the birth, Hindley, then 5, was sent by her parents to live with her grandmother, whose home was nearby.|$|E

5|$|Dannemann, {{the only}} {{eyewitness}} to Hendrix's final hours, said that sometime after 3 a.m., she prepared two tuna fish sandwiches for them after arriving {{back at her}} basement apartment. Around 4 a.m., Hendrix, struggling with insomnia after having consumed amphetamines hours earlier, asked her for sleeping tablets. She later said she refused his request hoping he would fall asleep naturally. Dannemann said she surreptitiously took a sleeping tablet sometime around 6 a.m., with Hendrix still awake. She awoke sometime between 10 and 10:20a.m. to find him sleeping normally in <b>bed</b> <b>next</b> to her. She said she then left to purchase cigarettes, and when she returned around 11 a.m., found him in bed breathing, although unconscious and unresponsive.

The two seek out Weinsider and catch him digging in Betsy's backyard. After a short conversation, the sheriff arrives at the house and shoots Weinsider.

500|$|Livingstone {{defended his}} claim about Hitler and Zionism by {{reference}} to Lenni Brenner's Zionism in the Age of the Dictators, and many commentators suggested that Livingstone {{was referring to the}} Haavara Agreement between Nazi Germany and the Zionist Federation of Germany. Livingstone's statements were criticised by historians, among them Roger Moorhouse, who said that they were historically inaccurate. However political scientist Norman Finkelstein said that whilst [...] "Livingstone maybe wasn’t precise enough, and lacked nuance", his comments did reflect an initial ambivalence on the part of Hitler towards Zionism. Following Livingstone's remarks about Hitler which prompted accusations of antisemitism, he allegedly told an audience at an event that [...] "It’s absurd to call me an anti-Semite, as two of my ex-girlfriends are Jewish. It’s offensive to them to say they were lying in <b>bed</b> <b>next</b> to someone who hates them." [...] Similarly, the accusations made him question whether he has Jewish ancestry on his mother's side.|$|E
500|$|On 11 October 2013, Universal Music Sweden {{posted a}} 16 seconds teaser {{of the video}} on its YouTube channel. On 16 October 2013, it was {{released}} on Lo's VEVO channel on YouTube. The video begins with Lo lying in <b>bed</b> <b>next</b> to her boyfriend. When she starts to sing, she has an out-of-body experience. In the next scene, Lo appears in a room where she cuts her head open and releases her [...] "demons and dark thoughts". In an interview with Artistdirect, she explained that the demons represent [...] "those thoughts about this other person [...] will always haunt you a bit" [...] and [...] "always stick with you". Then, she is walking on the city streets when the demons start to follow her. She runs barefoot through the woods, where she stops and sings around the entities. At {{the end of the}} video, they flow back inside of her and Lo returns to her bedroom.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} September 1995, and {{took place at}} the CTS Studios in London, with Madonna and co-actors Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. Engineer David Reitzas performed the mixing of the track at Larrabee North Studios, utilizing their Solid State Logic 9000 J series consoles for the mix. For the first day's sessions, music supervisor David Caddick suggested to record [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] with the 84 piece orchestra backing Madonna's vocals. However, Lloyd Webber was critical of [...] the recording arrangements done in the studio. The cast was also nervous. Flick noted that Banderas found the experience [...] "scary" [...] while Madonna was [...] "petrified" [...] when it came to recording the songs. [...] "I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber... I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterwards. I thought I had done a terrible job", the singer recalled. Conductor John Mauceri remembered another challenge the production faced was adapting the stage numbers into a feature film; [...] "On film, it's different than being on stage because the person on the screen in front of you is never farther than someone on the pillow in <b>bed</b> <b>next</b> to you". Parker declared the first day of recording as [...] "Black Monday", since it was [...] "filled with trepidation and nerves... All of us came from very different worlds—from popular music, from movies, and from musical theater—and so we were very apprehensive".|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{release of}} the work, Anger was arrested on {{obscenity}} charges. He was acquitted, after the case went to the Supreme Court of California, which deemed it to be art rather than pornography. Anger made the claim to have been seventeen {{years old when he}} made it, {{despite the fact that he}} was actually twenty, presumably to present himself as more of an enfant terrible. A homoerotic work lasting only 14 minutes, Fireworks revolves around a young man (played by Anger himself) associating with various navy sailors, who eventually turn on him, stripping him naked and beating him to death, ripping open his chest to find a compass inside. Several fireworks then explode, accompanied by a burning Christmas tree and the final shot shows the young man lying in <b>bed</b> <b>next</b> to another topless man. Of this film, Anger would later state in 1966 that [...] "This flick is all I have to say about being 17, the United States Navy, American Christmas and the fourth of July." [...] He would continuously alter and adapt the film up until 1980, with it finally being distributed on VHS in 1986.|$|E

2500|$|In her {{well-known}} article [...] "A Defense of Abortion", Judith Jarvis Thomson {{argues that}} abortion is in some circumstances permissible even if the embryo is a person and {{has a right to}} life, because the embryo's right to life is overtrumped by the woman's right to control her body and its life-support functions. [...] Her central argument involves a thought experiment. [...] Imagine, Thomson says, that you wake up in <b>bed</b> <b>next</b> to a famous violinist. [...] He is unconscious with a fatal kidney ailment; and because only you happen to have the right blood type to help, the Society of Music Lovers has kidnapped you and plugged your circulatory system into his so that your kidneys can filter poisons from his blood as well as your own. [...] If he is disconnected from you now, he will die; but in nine months he will recover and can be safely disconnected. [...] Thomson takes it that you may permissibly unplug yourself from the violinist even though this will kill him. [...] The right to life, Thomson says, does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of somethingthe use of your bodyto which he has no right. [...] Similarly, even if the fetus has a right to life, it does not have a right to use the pregnant woman's body and life-support functions against her will; and so aborting the pregnancy is permissible in at least some circumstances. [...] However, Thomson notes that the woman's right to abortion does not include the right to directly insist upon the death of the child, should the fetus happen to be viable, that is, capable of surviving outside the womb.|$|E
