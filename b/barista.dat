2500|$|On May 17, 2004, Starbucks's {{workers at}} the 36th and Madison store in midtown Manhattan {{organized}} the first Starbucks <b>barista</b> union in the United States. The union drive had its origins in barista's complaints that a starting wage of $7.75 an hour was not a living wage in New York City and that Starbucks refused to guarantee regularity of hours per week. The union has also joined with Global Exchange in calling on Starbucks to purchase at least 5% of the store's coffee from fair trade certified sources. The 12 workers submitted union cards to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for a certification election. Prior to the election, Starbucks filed an appeal with the NLRB, asking that the election be extended to several stores, not the single store that filed for an election. The NLRB agreed to review the appeal and impound the ballots at the Madison Avenue store. The IWW subsequently withdrew the election petition because the appeal could cause a several-year delay in the validation of the election. Starbucks claims the union withdrew {{due to a lack}} of interest by Starbucks workers. The IWW usually does not get involved in the NLRB election process, but rather focuses on winning incremental demands on the shop-floor through the practice of [...] "Solidarity Unionism." [...] On this basis, the organizing drive continues at Starbucks locations across the world.|$|E
