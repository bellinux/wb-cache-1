40|$|This work {{studied the}} {{microstructural}} characterization and mechanical behavior of low manganese Austempered Ductile Iron (ADI), {{with a view}} to improve the properties of iron and to increase the areas of applications. Three sets of ductile iron of specified composition were machined from Y-blocks to tensile and hardness pieces. The samples were preheated at 350 0 C for 1 hr and austenitised at 900 0 C for 1 hr in salt <b>bath</b> <b>furnace.</b> The three sets of samples were immediately austempered in the austempering salt <b>bath</b> <b>furnace</b> at uniform austempering temperatures of 300 0 C, 350 0 C and 400 0 C for 90, 120 and 150 minutes; each sample for each temperature window. All sets were prepared for metallographic examination; tensile and hardness tests were carried out. The results showed that maximum hardness, tensile and yield strength were obtained at austempering temperature of 350 0 C and at 150 minutes. At 300 0 C and 350 0 C, it was noticed that the hardness and strength increase with austempering time. The optimum tensile strength was 1300 MPa at 350 0 C after austempering for 150 minutes. In conclusion the austempering operation has a significant effect on the mechanical and microstructural properties of ADI. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Carbonitriding of {{four types}} of steels, namely, low carbon steel (LCS), medium carbon steel (MCS), low alloy steel (LAS) and high alloy steel (HAS) was {{achieved}} using cyanide salt bath heat treatment process. The steels, after preheating, were heated in a diesel fired salt bath heat treatment furnace and then quickly quenched in different media including air, oil and brine. The heat treatment processes were performed at different temperatures ranging from 790 oC to 920 oC. The heat treatment time was varied from 30 minutes to 120 minutes at an interval of 30 minutes so as to investigate {{its effect on the}} surface hardness of LCS. The surface hardness of all the heat treated steels samples were measured using an Indentec Rockwell hardness tester.

The self-regulating nature of SAFs is largely absent from the OSBFs, and hence the OSBFs rely more strongly on process control. As a first step towards implementing a process control system, a mass and energy balance was drawn up for the OSBFs, and this was used to develop operator guidance tables.

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} penetrated on {{the transformation}} of phases in the microstructures of austempered ductile iron with respect to different austempering holding times. Ductile iron samples were constituted in form of Y block double cylinder with dimension of 300 m x Ø 25 mm through CO 2 sand casting process in 60 kg capacity furnace. Austempering process were conducted by first austenitizing the samples at temperature of 900 ˚C for 1 hour. The process continues by rapidly quenched the samples inside salt <b>bath</b> <b>furnace</b> at 350 ˚C for three different holding times of 1 hour, 2 hours and 3 hour. Samples were then taken out and cooled at room temperature. Samples were then prepared in accordance to standard metallographic process and observed using Tabletop Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) model Hitachi TM 3000. Phases were then verified through X-Ray Diffraction analysis (XRD) test by Rigaku diffractometer. The phase structures of as cast ductile iron mainly consisted of graphite nodules embedded in ferrite and pearlite phases Austempering the samples for 1 hour holding time promoted the structures of ferrite platelets and bainitic structures surrounding the graphite. Longer austempering holding times resulted in coarsening of the ferrite platelets structures and transformation from lower bainite to upper bainite structures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{ferritic}} rolling strategy {{allows for the}} production of two different hot strip grades, a "soft " and a "hard " hot strip. The "soft " hot strip is rolled in the upper ferrite region and a sufficiently high coiling temperature ensures direct recrystallisation in the coil. The "hard " hot strip is rolled at relatively lower temperatures in the ferrite temperature region and exhibits a strained microstructure with a desirable rolling texture. Furthermore, these ferritic rolled hot strips can be used as initial strip for subsequent cold rolling. The current investigation focuses {{on the development of the}} recrystalli-sation texture of cold rolled and annealed ferritic rolled hot strip for different cold reductions. For this purpose "soft " and "hard " hot strips were produced on a laboratory hot rolling mill. These strips were cold rolled with a total reduction of 40 to 80 % to a final thickness of 0. 5 mm. Subsequently the strips were subjected to simulated continuous annealing, using a salt <b>bath</b> <b>furnace.</b> The macro texture of both types of specimens was measured and correlated to the mechanical properties, including the Lankford values. A very different development of the recrystallisation texture and hence mechanical properties has been observed. However, both grades yielded improved deep-drawing properties...|$|E

Hardening, tempering and austempering treatments were conducted using muffle furnace and salt <b>bath</b> <b>furnace.</b> After heat treatment samples were quenched in oil. The results of present work confirmed that toughness and hardness are inversely related {{with each other and}} are highly dependent on the type of heat treatment employed.

The effect of chills on the microstructure and mechanical properties of CADI was investigated after Austempering. Three samples of chromium alloyed CADI, the first sample without chill, the second sample with bottom chill and the third sample with bottom and side chills were produced in order to evaluate the effect of chills on its mechanical properties. The samples were austenised for 2 hours at 925 ° C and then austempered at 325 ° C for 2 hours in a salt <b>bath</b> <b>furnace.</b> The microstructural features of the as-cast and the austempered CADI samples were analysed using Optical Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The mechanical properties of the CADI samples (as-cast and austempered) were evaluated for hardness, impact and wear. By austempering at 325 ° C for 2 hours a typical microstructure of bainite was produced in all the three samples. Hardness and wear resistance of austempered samples produced using bottom and side chills were considerably higher than the corresponding values in samples produced without using any chill and also by using only bottom chill. This enhanced mechanical property in the bottom and side chill sample is attributed {{to the presence of}} bainite, carbides and more of uniform fine graphite nodules...|$|E

Aluminum B 319 which is of the type Al-Si-Cu-Mg {{was used in this}} study. The result of a theoretical study of diffusion-controlled dissolution of planar, cylindrical, spherical and elliptical θ-Al 2 Cu precipitates are presented. Graphical relationships between the precipitate size and dissolution time were developed for a constant diffusion coefficient. The validity of various approximate solutions including: stationary interface, moving boundary using MATLAB and moving boundary using COMSOL software were considered. COMSOL was capable of two-dimensional and three-dimensional modelling. In addition, the dissolution of the Q-Al 5 Mg 8 Si 6 Cu 2 precipitate which is a multi-component phase — that involves the diffusion of more than one component during the dissolution process — as well as the concurrent dissolution of θ-Al 2 Cu and Q-Al 5 Mg 8 Si 6 Cu 2 were modelled using MATLAB. Both two and three-dimensional models were developed using COMSOL. Numerical models were validated through a series of experimental measurements using a fluidized <b>bath</b> <b>furnace.</b> The results show that the model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results and little variations are due to the simplifications made in the model. The effect of Secondary Dendrite Arm Spacing (SDAS) on dissolution time was also examined and it was shown that the model developed was able to accurately capture these effects as well on the time required for dissolution to of these phases to occur.

40|$|This {{project was}} the first step in {{developing}} a control system for the open slag <b>bath</b> <b>furnace</b> at Highveld Steel, in order to maximize production levels and product quality. In this dissertation, available knowledge from literature and practical experience is included. This is then processed to propose a realistic control system with the current resources available at Highveld Steel. Through research and practical experience it is shown that these furnaces are extremely sensitive to raw material quality and consistency of decision making. This {{is a result of the}} open bath configuration that necessitates the careful control of the excess energy, and the raw material composition supplied to the furnace. Through this project it was shown that both the productivity and the product quality (vanadium recovery) can be increased by simply controlling the feed-topower ratio and correct use of correction material. This has the effect of stabilizing the process energy balance which results in smaller slag temperature variations and therefore also less product quality variability. Through controlling the feed-power-ratio, energy consumption was also shown to be reduced, since excess power is minimized without negatively impacting on productivity. In this project a proposal is made to control the flow of material between the two stages in the process, which is based on either being kiln or furnace constrained. A better tapping scheduling is also proposed, based on both material accumulations inside the furnace and the charging condition of the furnace. This results in having sufficient pressure to tap iron and slag at good rates and should also yield consistent tapping weights and add to general process stability. However, engineering availability strongly impacts on both process control and furnace productivity. Consistent availability of the furnace and its supporting systems is hence essential for optimal operation. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.

Sampling campaigns and continuous temperature measurement of the melts were performed for different alloy and slag taps at a major ferrochrome producer. Both a submerged arc furnace and open arc furnace are evaluated in this way, by way of comparison. The slags of both open arc and submerged arc furnaces were found to be of similar degrees of homogeneity, with much spatial variance in the reducible iron and chromium oxides. However, it was found that the alloy melts deriving from open arc furnaces were significantly less homogeneous than the alloy derived from submerged arc furnace alloy production.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the dynamic {{behaviour}} of the freeze lining and slag bath, and the interactions between these components in an ilmenite-smelting furnace process. The purpose of the work was {{to gain a better}} understanding of these issues and to ultimately contribute to an improved understanding of the ilmenite-smelting process in its entirety, and to future improvements in the design, operation and control of these processes. A mathematical model of the freeze lining and furnace sidewall was developed. This model was used in isolation for focused characterisation of the dynamic behaviour and interactions of the freeze lining and slag bath. The influences of net power input and slag composition were studied and various aspects of the freeze lining and slag bath were considered. These aspects included freeze lining thickness, temperature distribution through the freeze lining and furnace sidewall, composition distribution through the freeze lining, slag bath temperature and slag bath composition. The thermal response of thermocouples installed in the furnace sidewall to changing conditions on the inside of the furnace was also investigated. A mathematical model of the crust that forms on the slag bath surface was developed. This model was not used in isolation, and was only incorporated into a complete model of the process. A mathematical model of the entire ilmenite-smelting furnace process was constructed. This model incorporated the two models mentioned above and was able to describe the metal bath, slag <b>bath,</b> <b>furnace</b> atmosphere, freeze lining, furnace sidewall and the crust that is sometimes present on top of the slag bath. The model was used to study the influence of changes in operational parameters on the slag bath and freeze lining. The operational parameters that were studied included electrical power and reductant feed rate, both relative to ilmenite feed rate. The influence of severe operational errors and furnace down time were also investigated. Operational errors included loss of all feed while maintain electrical power input, and loss of reductant feed while maintaining power input and ilmenite feed. The above-mentioned studies were conducted by executing numerous experiments with two of the mathematical models. The experimental results were processed into sets of graphs displaying variations in the aspects that were considered. Many valuable insights resulted from the interpretation of these results. One specific aspect that formed part of the scope of this work was the origin of the compositional invariance of the slag close to the stoichiometric M 3 O 5 composition. This invariance was studied and a mechanism was proposed that explains the observed behaviour. The proposed mechanism created some questions about other mechanisms in the process. These mechanisms were also considered and elaborated on. The models and results produced in this study provide valuable insights into the behaviour of the ilmenite-smelting process. It also represents a useful foundation for future modelling work, and finally, it presents numerous opportunities for organisations operating ilmenite-smelting furnaces to improve their understanding and even the performance of their processes.

40|$|Mintek {{together}} with Middelburg Steel & Alloys, developed the DC arc furnace {{process for the}} production of ferroalloys with the expressed objective of smelting ore fines (< 1 mm) without the need for agglomeration. In the case of ferrochrome production, the DC arc furnace, being a semi-open bath operation, loses radiant energy directly from the <b>bath</b> to the <b>furnace</b> roof and sidewalls above the melt. This energy loss is reflected in a higher electrical energy usage per ton of alloy than for a submerged-arc operation smelting lumpy ores or sintered pellets. The difference increases still further when pre-heated sintered pellet feed is used in a submerged-arc operation. This shortcoming of the DC arc furnace can however be overcome by preheating the feed to the furnace in a fluidized bed or flash reactor fuelled by cold furnace off-gas. In addition to fluidization and preheating testwork, various preheating flowsheets with associated mass and energy balances have been developed and compared from a techno-economic viewpoint. The three major advantages identified were: a) fluidized beds can preheat ores and fluxes up to 950 °C without sticking and defluidizing, b) the open <b>bath</b> DC arc <b>furnace</b> does not require expensive coke or char to maintain the burden porosity and, c) the capital cost associated with the milling, pelletising and sintering plant falls away since ore fines are used directly...|$|R
40|$|Intensive {{quenching}} (IQ) {{process is}} an alternative way of hardening (quenching) steel parts {{through the use of}} highly agitated water and then still air. It was developed by IQ Technologies, Inc. (IQT) of Akron, Ohio. While conventional quenching is usually performed in environmentally unfriendly oil or water/polymer solutions, the IQ process uses highly agitated environmentally friendly water or low concentration water/mineral salt solutions. The IQ method is characterized by extremely high cooling rates of steel parts. In contrast to conventional quenching, where parts cool down to the quenchant temperature and usually have tensile or neutral residual surface stresses at the end of quenching. The IQ process is interrupted when the part core is still hot and when there are maximum compressive stresses deep into the parts, thereby providing hard, ductile, better wear resistant parts. The project goal was to advance the patented IQ process from feasibility to commercialization in the heat-treating and forging industries to reduce significantly energy consumption and environmental impact, to increase productivity and to enhance economic competitiveness of these industries as well as Steel, Metal Casting and Mining industries. To introduce successfully the IQ technology in the U. S. metal working industry, the project team has completed the following work over the course of this project: A total of 33 manufacturers of steel products provided steel parts for IQ trails. IQT conducted IQ demonstrations for 34 different steel parts. Our customers tested intensively quenched parts in actual field conditions to evaluate the product service life and performance improvement. The data obtained from the field showed the following: Service life (number of holes punched) of cold-work punches (provided by EHT customer and made of S 5 shock-resisting steel) was improved by two to eight times. Aluminum extrusion dies provided by GAM and made of hot work H- 13 steel outperformed the standard dies by at least 50 %. Dies provided by an AST customer, made of plain carbon 1045 steel and used for pellet manufacturing outperformed the standard dies by more than 100 %. Concrete crusher liner wear plates provided by an EHT customer and made of 1045 steel, had the same surface hardness as the plates made of more expensive, pre-hardened high alloy HARDOX- 500 material supplied by a Swedish company and used currently by the EHT customer. The 1045 material intensively quenched wear plates are currently in the field. Concrete block molding machine wear plates provided by an IQT customer and made of 8620 steel were processed at the AST production IQ system using a 40 % reduced carburization cycle. An effective case depth in the intensively quenched wear plates was the same as in the standard, oil quenched parts. Base keys provided by an EHT customer and made of 8620 steel were processed using a 40 % reduced carburization cycle. The intensively quenched parts showed the same performance as standard parts. IQT introduced the IQ process in heat treat practices of three commercial heat-treating shops: Akron Steel Treating Co., Summit Heat Treating Co. and Euclid Heat Treating Co. CWRU conducted a material characterization study for a variety of steels to develop a database to support changing/modification of recognized standards for quenching steel parts. IQT conducted a series of IQ workshops, published seven technical papers and participated in ASM Heat Treating Society conference and exposition and in Furnace North America Show. IQT designed and built a fully automated new IQ system installed at the Center for Intensive Quenching. This system includes the following major components: a stand-alone 1, 900 -gallon IQ water system, a 24 '' x 24 '' atmosphere pit furnace, and an automated load transfer mechanism. IQT established a ''Center for Intensive Quenching'' at the AST facilities. The 4, 000 square feet Center includes the following equipment: High-velocity single part quenching IQ unit developed and built previously under EMTEC CT- 65 project.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} was to examine of the {{influence}} of the Zr i Ce on the structure of the newly developed complex hot-work tool steel 47 CrMoWVTiCeZr 16 - 26 - 8 in relation to standard hot-work tool steel X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1. Design/methodology/approach: The investigations steels were made using the specimens made from the experimental steel, for which the working 47 CrMoWVTiCeZr 16 - 26 - 8 denotation was adopted, similar to the ones used in the ISO Standard on using the standard alloy hot-work tool steel X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1. Both investigated steels were melted in a vacuum electric furnace. Specimens made from the investigated steels were heat treated with austenitizing in salt <b>bath</b> <b>furnaces</b> for 30 minutes in the temperature range of 970 - 1180 °C with gradation of 30 °C. Next, the specimens were tempered twice in the temperature range of 450 - 660 °C for 2 hours. Findings: The 47 CrMoWVTiCeZr 16 - 26 - 8 steel quenched from the temperature of 1120 °C has the martensitic structure with the small portion of the retained austenite and alloy carbides partially dissolved during austenitizing (about 3. 5 %), including the MC type carbides (based on ZrC, TiC, (Ti,V) C and VC, with differing chemical compositions and crystallographic lattice parameter) and of the M 2 C 3 type (based on Ce 2 C 3). Research limitations/implications: Basing on the investigations of the newly developed 47 CrMoWVTiCeZr 16 - 26 - 8 steel and the standard X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 steel, the most advantageous heat treatment conditions were determined to obtain thesis most advantageous structure and mechanical properties: for the 47 CrMoWVTiCeZr 16 - 26 - 8 steel quenching at the temperature of 1120 °C and tempering at the temperature of 540 °C, and for the X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 one quenching at the temperature of 1060 °C and tempering at the temperature of 510 °C. Originality/value: The newly developed hot-work tool steel include Zr and Ce characterizations good structure and can be used to hot work small-size tools which requires higher strength properties at elevated temperature...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{electric}} arc furnaces {{were developed by}} Paul Héroult, of France, with a commercial plant established in the United States in 1907. The Sanderson brothers formed The Sanderson Brothers steel Co. in Syracuse, New York, installing the first {{electric arc}} furnace in the U.S. This furnace is now on display at Station Square, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Initially [...] "electric steel" [...] was a specialty product for such uses as machine tools and spring steel. Arc furnaces were also used to prepare calcium carbide for use in carbide lamps. The Stassano electric furnace is an arc type furnace that usually rotates to mix the <b>bath.</b> The Girod <b>furnace</b> {{is similar to the}} Héroult furnace.|$|R

The use of so called fixed-point calibration rods {{makes it possible to}} calibrate such sensors at one particularly chosen temperature easily. A second sensor for measuring the calibration temperature (reference sensor) is not necessary. In most cases, the calibration procedure can be performed in exactly that situation where the measuring application normally takes place (in-situ calibration). Thus the whole individual measuring circuitry and its specific thermal conditions are involved during calibration process. Fixed-point calibration rods are useful for quality management inspections in rough industrial application areas, for outdoor surveying tasks as well as for precision temperature measurements in calibration <b>baths</b> or <b>furnaces.</b> The paper presents structure and handling of fixed-point calibration rods. Examples of application including measuring uncertainty budgets are outlined...|$|R
40|$|ITS- 90 {{specifies}} {{a series}} of temperatures which are used to define the scale. Supplementary Information to ITS- 90 describes how these substances can be embodied into structures, known as fixed point cells that are useful to thermometrists. At present, fixed point cells are used with apparatus such as cryostats, <b>baths</b> and <b>furnaces.</b> However, current furnaces for example are expensive. The ideal furnace employs a heat siphon which has thermal conductance 200 times better than copper to create isothermal conditions during phase transitions. It {{may not be possible}} for a furnace to use the working fluid of choice for safety reasons. There is often poor thermal conductance between the furnace and the fixed point cell such that {{a series of}} furnaces are required to enable the required temperature range to be achieved. A patent application filed during September 2007 describes a combined metal clad fixed point cell and heat siphon, which when heated provides an isothermal environment for the metal within to change state. The outer wall of the cell becomes the inner wall of the heat siphon with cost as well as performance benefits. The device is called a “Siphonic Cell”. Siphonic Cells can be of Indium, Tin, Zinc, Aluminium, Silver...|$|R
