40|$|A {{possible}} configuration for undertaking diffractive imaging microscopy in {{the conventional}} {{scanning transmission electron microscope}} (STEM) is to defocus the probe by a large distance in order to minimise the number of diffraction patterns required to reconstruct the ptychographical image. Although the characteristics of STEM probes have been well explored and measured near the <b>beam</b> <b>crossover,</b> they are rarely observed (or calculated) at very large defoci. In this paper we compare probes calculated under a variety of approximations with measured data from a JEOL 2010 F in STEM mode. When the illumination aperture is narrow and the defocus is large (near parallel illumination useful for ptychographical imaging) the Ronchigram cannot be used easily to characterize aberration, We develop an alternative method of estimating the effective aperture size and condenser lens spherical aberration...|$|E

This emittance was apparently caused in an early 60 ” achromatic bend. To get this beam through subsequent bends without wall interce tion, the quadrupole focusing had to be changed from t R e design amount; as a result, the emittance grew further. This paper discusses various mechanisms for this emittance growth in the 60 ” bend, including effects caused by path changes in the bend resulting from wake-field-induced energy than es particles in the beam and examines emittance B of liters, ranging from a simple aperture near a <b>beam</b> <b>crossover</b> to more complicated telescope schemes designed to regain the original emittance before the 60 ”bend...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} study the Split {{aperture}} decoupling method is applied to pillbox antennas {{in order to have}} low side lobe and high <b>beam</b> <b>crossover</b> levels at the same time. These two constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously for any passive and lossless multi-beam antenna systems with a single radiating aperture. In order to validate the proposed concept a novel Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) multibeam Pillbox antenna with two radiating apertures has been designed at 24. 15 GHz and manufactured using standard Printed Circuit Board (PCB) fabrication process. The measured results agree with simulations showing a good scanning performance at 24. 15 GHz over an angular sector of ± 40 °.

30|$|Two-stage {{irradiation}} {{approach of}} solid surfaces {{has been used}} by various groups to develop new surface features and understanding of growth mechanism of such features [22, 23, 32, 34, 43]. Kumar et al. investigated the role of amorphous/crystalline (a/c) interface using the approach of sequential irradiation of pre-rippled surface of Si (100) [22, 23]. It was argued that the role of a/c interface cannot be ignored in comparison of sputtering and diffusion in surface rippling. In line with the above argument, Toyoda et al. performed the Monte Carlo simulation for cluster-ion-beam sputtering of pre-ripples surface and introduced the importance of re-deposition of sputtered atoms and diffusion toward the bottom of the valleys and hence the exponential decay of amplitudes [43]. In the work of Kim et al., related to cross-ion irradiation on pre-rippled surface of Au(001), an exponential decay of pre-patterned ripples was found and further new ripples developed only after extended flat areas form along the crossing ion <b>beams</b> [34]. The <b>crossover</b> irradiation enhanced the re-deposition of sputtered atoms due to already grown roughened surface and hence the coarsening of surface features. For the present study, the cone-like features observed at low fluence (of 80  keV Ar+ ions) cross-irradiation may be an effect of superposition of ripples, where sputter re-deposition and sputtering simultaneously occur. On higher fluences, sputtering of surface is much dominated than the re-deposition of sputtered atoms. It may be argued here that for the present study, the ion beam energy (= 80  keV) is much higher than the one used by Kim et al. (0.5 – 2.0  keV). From application point of view, it should be remembered that plasmonic-based photovoltaics demands thinning of the light-absorbing layers without sacrificing the absorption, which enables more efficient carrier collection and voltage generation. The light-trapping capability of Ag nanocones is interesting in this respect and proven theoretically by full field electromagnetic simulations [44]. Owing to their tunable plasmonic response, cone-like nanostructures of Ag are reported as the promising candidate for light trapping for photovoltaics and broadband antireflection properties [44 – 46]. It should be further noted that Wehner et al. found micro-cones, when Cu target was irradiated by 400 to 600  eV Hg ions assisted with Mo seeding (in sputtering plasma process) [27, 47]. They stated that fairly small impurity of high sputtering yield material can promote the cone formation at the target surface. In comparison to their work (sputtering duration ~ 4  h and obtained microscale cone structures), the present work opens up the possibility of a fast top-down approach for cone-like metal nanostructures by low energy ion beams. We anticipate that quality of obtained cone-like nanostructures (uniformity and shape morphology) can be improved by further optimization of ion energy and using low values of fluence.|$|R
40|$|A eld emitter array (FEA) with a ve-stacked gate {{electrode}}, that is, a quintuple-gated FEA with a four-stacked electrode lens, was fabricated. The four-stacked electrode {{forms an}} einzel lens where {{the second and}} third electrodes are connected through a contact hole. Because the electron velocity of the einzel lens in a quintuple-gated FEA is smaller than that of the quadruple-gated FEA, the quintuple-gated FEA has a stronger electron convergence. The slit sweeping method conrmed that a <b>beam</b> <b>crossover</b> is formed for the quintuple-gated FEA. A field emitter array (FEA) with a focusing electrode is an appealing device for electron beam lithography, 1) high definition field emission displays, 2) and image sensors. 3) Previously, the fabrication and characteristics of a double-gated FEA with two-stacked electrodes have been reported. 4 { 6) Double-gated FEAs can effectively generate a focused electron beams. How-ever, one drawback to a double-gated FEA is drastic reduction in the emission current under the focusing condition due to the decreased field enhancement at the emitter tip caused by the low potential of the vicinal focusing electrode. 4) Recently, we reported a volcano struc-tured field emitter comprised of a focusing electrode located below the extraction gate (Gex) electrode. 7, 8) This volcano structured FEA is the first to focus the electron beam withou...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the methods used}} or proposed for use in multi-beam and/or multi-satellite networks designed to provide Mobile Satellite Services (MSS). Specific topics include <b>beam</b> <b>crossover</b> in the North American Mobile Satellite (MSAT) system as well as registration and live call hand-off for a multi-regional geosynchronous (GEO) satellite based system and a global coverage Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) system. In the MSAT system, the individual satellite beams cover very large geographic areas so the need for live call hand-off was not anticipated. This paper discusses the methods used {{to keep track of}} the beam location of the users so that incoming call announcements or other messages may be directed to them. Proposed new GEO systems with large numbers of beams will provide much smaller geographic coverage in individual beams and thus the need arises {{to keep track of the}} user's location as well as to provide live call hand-off as the user traverses from beam to beam. This situation also occurs in proposed LEO systems where the problems are worsened by the need for satellite to satellite hand-off as well as beam to beam hand-off within a single satellite. The paper discusses methods to accomplish these handoffs and proposes system architectures to address the various hand-off scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Using the Enhanced Modified Faraday Cup (EMFC), the {{differences}} in the beams produced by two electron beam (EB) welders are characterized at different focus settings and work distances. For example, EMFC measurements show that sharply focused beams display different shapes and peak power densities which vary by nearly 20 % for the same welding parameters on these two welders. Increases in work distance on each machine were shown to result in decreases in both the peak power density and the resulting weld size and shape. Because of {{the differences}} in machine performance, additional differences arise when comparing the welds produced by each machine. These different weld dimensions are attributed to differences in the beam shape and a 70 mm difference in the theoretical <b>beam</b> <b>crossover</b> location in the upper column of the two welders. The crossover location, which can not be physically measured, is determined using the EMFC by analyzing the beam distribution parameters of sharply focused beams over a range of work distances and can be used to explain the variation in the peak power densities of the two machines. Once the machines are characterized using this quantitative tool, changes in either the beam focus or work distance can be made to attain similar beams from different welders, thus providing a baseline for developing modern weld transfer procedures...|$|E
40|$|This file {{contains}} three final reports: 1. ion detector CoMA: Within {{the developmental}} {{frame of the}} CoMA-experiment which was planned to fly on the CRAF mission an ion detector was developed for the Design Verification Unit (DVU). It was shown that an ion detector with sufficient time resolution (2 ns) could be realized. The detector system consists of 2 units which are mechanically integrated: Dual Multichannelplate Detector; Nonlinear Preamplifier Unit. Among others, the following topics especially important under space flight aspects have been covered: finalizing investigations on the problem area of multiple pulses, development of an ESD protection circuitry, investigations on lifetime and of redundancy concepts, pulse-width coding of double pulses. 2. ion optics of the primary ion source: The COMA (Cometary Matter Analyzer) - instrument is a high mass resolution time - of flight secondary ion mass spectrometer. The DVU (design verification unit) has been constructed and the TOF - section has been tested successfully using an external pulsed ion gun. In the DVU, the principal direction of the primary beam is parallel {{to that of the}} secondary beam due to mechanical design constraints. Therefore, the primary beam has to be deflected out of the main direction in order to hit the target in front of the secondary extraction lens. As in all high resolution TOF - SIMS, the primary beam pulse length should be of the order of a few nanoseconds. In addition, the COMA design goal for the primary beam spot size is 10 - 20 #mu#. The pre-target primary beam deflection therefore has to be designed for local and temporal <b>beam</b> <b>crossover</b> at the target position. Two basic deflection geometries have been suggested for this purpose: (a) a 'symmetric reflectron loop' consisting of two symmetrically situated parallel - plate condensors as 'ion mirrors' separated by drift spaces; and (b) an electrostatic sectorfield preceded by a transversal buncher, compensating to first order, the energy dispersion of the sector. 3. Components of the primary ion source CoMA: This last report contains a compilation of operating data on liquid metal indium ion emitters. The compilation covers operating experience on single emitters and on single emitter - and multi -emitter ion source modules obtained during ground tests as well as during flight tests on the space station MIR.
