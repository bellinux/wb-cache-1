5|$|The semi-luxury Futura variant {{was heavily}} {{based on the}} XT, and marketed towards families. Futura models gained cruise control, 16-inch alloy wheels, rear power windows and full <b>body-coloured</b> side-view mirrors and side-protection moldings. But, side-impact airbags and power {{adjustable}} pedals were only available as options.|$|E
25|$|Launched in October 1989, the Series II {{brought with}} it a four-speed {{automatic}} transmission, <b>body-coloured</b> B-pillars, and the 3.2-litre engine was dropped. Despite the Series II models having significantly fewer problems than the Series I, Series II prices are also affected by curtailed resale values. The same problem also affects the NA Fairlane and DA series LTD, and even the ute and panel van variants, which persisted with the older XF architecture.|$|E
25|$|The ED Falcon came in {{response}} to Holden's new VR Commodore in 1993. The front grille was now elliptical to differentiate it from the EB, and the sports genre (XR6, and XR8) gained an exclusive quad headlamp cluster. Making a comeback in the ED range was the Futura. The safety orientated Futura was marketed towards private buyers, and was equipped with cruise control, anti-lock brakes, and featured <b>body-coloured</b> mirrors. For {{the first time since}} the XF series, the luxurious Fairmont Ghia trim level was not available in station wagon form.|$|E
25|$|The GLi was {{the most}} basic model Falcon, selling well with fleets. Its {{features}} list was identical {{to that of the}} previous model, which included Ford's straight-six engine, with an option of upgrading to the Windsor V8. The slightly more equipped Futura features ABS brakes, front power windows, cruise control and a number of luxury features, like back seat headrests and an enhanced sound system. To distinguish it from the GLi, <b>body-coloured</b> components replaced the black plastic type. Regardless of the model chosen, an optional dual fuel tank could be fitted to run on both autogas and petrol, with the transmission limited to the four-speed automatic.|$|E
25|$|Powertrains were {{verbatim}} of the Camry, {{with the}} 3S-FC for the entry-level SL, and higher-end SLX and SLE models graced with the 3S-FE engine. An SLX option pack, {{known as the}} Executive was also available. The SL opened up the Apollo range with remote exterior mirrors, intermittent windscreen wipers, heated rear screen demister, remote trunk release for sedans and fuel filler door, a two-speaker radio cassette player and tinted side and rear glass. SLX variants were distinguished by their full wheel covers, {{as opposed to the}} SL model's steel wheels with centre caps. The Executive variant was not a stand-alone model, but an option pack for the SLX, adding power steering and automatic transmission. SLE equipment included the four-wheel disc brakes, variable intermittent windscreen wipers, a four-speaker stereo, <b>body-coloured</b> bumpers, dual odometers, automatic headlamp cut-off system, velour seat upholstery, centre back-seat armrest, power antenna, central locking with illuminated driver's door lock and front map lamps. As per the Camry, in May 1991, the EFI version of the engine was made standard.|$|E
2500|$|A {{special edition}} {{produced}} wholly by Land Rover. In the front, {{the car is}} little different from a standard Autobiography, more wood finishes are offered, as are a few unique trim pieces. The difference is in the rear cabin, which is furnished with two iPads, a fixed armrest with metal laptop desk, electric reclining climate-controlled seats, and a refrigerator. The car can be ordered in two colours, with [...] 20-inch wheels, <b>body-coloured</b> door handles and smoked grills and gills. 500 cars were produced.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, {{the number}} of models offered was reduced {{to make way for}} the new 205 and exports to most foreign markets {{gradually}} came to an end. It remained on sale in France until the end of production in 1988. The sporting ZS remained on sale until late 1985; for the 1986 model year only the [...] 1,124cc engine remained. There was a minor facelift in 1987, introducing a new grille with three <b>body-coloured</b> horizontal bars and anthracite bumpers - now without a chrome band. The Z, Style Z, and five-door GLS continued to be available with this engine in the home market until 1988.|$|E
2500|$|The second 1998 {{special edition}} was the [...] "Heritage", {{intended}} to hark {{back to the}} early days of Land Rover in the 1940s. Available in 90 or 110 variants, the Heritage was only available in the two original colours offered by the company— the dark bronze green and the light pastel Atlantic green. A metal mesh-effect front grille, <b>body-coloured</b> alloy wheels and wing mirrors and silver-painted door and windscreen hinges were all employed to make the Heritage look similar to the original Series I of 1948. Inside, special instruments were used, with black-on-beige displays. The powertrain was the standard Td5 diesel engine and 5 speed manual transmission.|$|E
2500|$|The Camry {{was given}} a {{facelift}} in 1994 for the 1995 model year. Minor exterior changes included a revised front fascia with different front turn signals and reshaped headlamps. Additionally, the rear fascia was updated, now with <b>body-coloured</b> plastic between the tail lamps where the model name [...] "Camry" [...] was printed. This was instead of the red plastic on higher trim levels and black plastic on lower trim levels of the 1992 to 1994 models. The tail lamps themselves were also slightly different. Another change, this time mechanical came in 1996; the 2.2-liter engine was detuned slightly to [...] to meet stricter emissions standards. Additionally, in 1996 the cam angle sensor in the distributor was also replaced with a crank angle sensor to achieve a smoother idle.|$|E
2500|$|Reportedly costing A$1million, the radically {{different}} Series II model of April 1992 primarily benefitted from a higher capacity 6-cylinder engine (up 35cubic centimetres or from 3949cc to 3984cc), bringing its nominal total swept capacity to 4.0-litres. The transmission and electronics were also improved and, externally, styling changes abounded including the base model now having <b>body-coloured</b> bumpers and its matte black plastic exterior door handles in a glossy finish. Other {{aspects of this}} upgrade consisted of improvements in safety, electronics and overall refinement. For example: the car now featured an advanced [...] "Smartlock" [...] security locking system standard across all models; anti-lock brakes became optional; a lap sash centre rear seatbelt became standard (from 1993); foam-filled A-pillars helped deliver better crash protection and Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) reductions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{keeping with}} Ian Callum's new design {{direction}} for Jaguar, {{it is an}} all-new exterior design and {{a break from the}} XJ series mould carried over on all previous generations. It is a longer, wider car that looks much bigger than its predecessor. The front has clear links with the executive car XF, although with slimmer, sleeker lights and a larger, squarer grille and more aggressive appearance. The rear is the contentious part, like nothing Jaguar has shown before. The upright, swooping taillights, nicknamed [...] "cat's claws", and black roof panels each side of the rear screen, which aim to hide the XJ's width, are the most striking aspects. There is also a standard full-length sunroof, that extends all the way back with just a single <b>body-coloured</b> roof panel that the designer likens to bridges on yachts.|$|E
2500|$|Power-assisted front {{disc brakes}} were now {{standard}} across the Falcon range. The GT {{variant of the}} XB also included four-wheel disc brakes (the earlier GT/GT-HO models used large finned drums at the rear). The first 211 XB GTs built were fitted with a US-built version of the Cleveland [...] V8 known as the 'big port' engine, and later XB GTs were fitted with an Australian-built version of the engine with 'small port' heads. A notable difference in performance is seen between these engines, and also in resale value, as the early US-powered GTs are rarer, so more collectable. The twin driving lights remained, as did the bonnet locks. The bonnet scoops of the GT were now integrated into the [...] "power bulge" [...] on the bonnet, the bumpers were now <b>body-coloured,</b> and the power bulge, wheel arches, sills, and valances were painted in a contrasting colour to the body colour (usually black, but dependent upon the actual body colour choice).|$|E
5000|$|Cosmetically, the XJR {{differed}} from the standard cars with a <b>body-coloured</b> grille surround, mesh grille insert, <b>body-coloured</b> boot-lid plinth, larger exhaust outlets, special five-spoke [...] "Sport" [...] alloy wheels, and [...] "XJR" [...] badging. Rain gutters and window surrounds were matte black, except on North American models where they were polished stainless steel.|$|E

50|$|The F6 Typhoon {{did not get}} any {{mechanical}} upgrades {{with the}} BF MkII update of late-2006. Minor changes included new design alloy wheels and a change to graphite fog-lamp surrounds (instead of <b>body-coloured).</b> FPV also introduced the luxury focused Force 6 during the MKII update.|$|E
50|$|The semi-luxury Futura variant {{was heavily}} {{based on the}} XT, and marketed towards families.

50|$|The {{original}} Kancil underwent two minor facelifts. In 1997, the car's grille and bumpers {{were better}} integrated to support {{to a larger}} grille and rounded indicator lights. In 2000, the car was given another slight facelift consisting of <b>body-coloured</b> side mouldings, a new grille and reprofiled front bumper with larger indicators.|$|E
