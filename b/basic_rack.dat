40|$|The fillet of {{the gear}} tooth is highly {{stressed}} in operation; so for heavily loaded gears, the fillet geometry must be controlled. The manufacturer's task is to, within acceptable tolerances, produce the gear to the designer's specifications {{regardless of the}} manufacturing method. Most often gear cutting tools are used that work under generating conditions. The tool will form the gear tooth; so to produce the specified gear geometry and, especially, the fillet geometry, this tool must be conjugated to the same <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> as the gear to cut. However, this gives a risk that the tooth tip of the tool will be undercut, and if this occurs the tool will not cut the intended gear fillet. In this report, novel analytical equations are derived, which predict the limit when the tool tip will be undercut. It is shown that if the gear tooth should be conjugated to the standard <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> with a circular fillet, which is the normal case, very large tool-tooth numbers are needed for pinion shaper cutters and gear skiving cutters to avoid this type of undercut. However, the minimum tooth number to achieve a smooth continuous tool-tooth profile is reduced by modifications to the fillet of the <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> profile...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the higher}} speed ratio and profile shifted gear drives, the maximum fillet {{stress in the}} pinion and the gear is not equal. The {{load-carrying}} {{capacity of the gear}} drives can be improved by removing this unbalanced maximum fillet stress. This paper has explained an idea to remove this unbalanced maximum fillet stress and design the spur gear drives with uniform fillet strength. This uniform fillet strength of the gear drive can be achieved by changing the tooth thickness of <b>basic</b> <b>racks</b> on the pitch lines from the standard tooth thickness (0. 5 πm) in to a non-standard one (kgcπm, kgc≠ 0. 5). The influence of gear parameters such as backup ratio, cutter tip radius and addendum modification factors on the maximum fillet stress has been analyzed through FEM with different values of tooth thickness coefficient and finally the optimum value of tooth thickness coefficient are suggested for the given spur gear drive that improve the fillet capacity in bending...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the influence of design features of the flexspline in a harmonic drive, such as the relative radial deformation, the relative coating thickness and the design features of the <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> tooth profile, on stress values in the bottom lands of a toothed ring. Design/methodology/approach: In numerical calculations, the software developed at the Faculty of Transport of the Silesian University of Technology was used. The program automatically generates a profile of the flexspline and a boundary elements mesh {{on the grounds of the}} flexspline and working tool assigned parameters. In the analysis of the state of stress, the boundary element method (BEM) was applied. Findings: A decreased value of the curve radius of the head of the <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> tooth profile results in a change in the width of the tooth bottom land, shortening of the transition curve in the tooth base and a reduction of the tooth thickness at its base, which in turn leads to increased values of stress. Yet, the influence of the relative curve radius of the head of the <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> tooth profile on the stress value is insignificant. The increase of the torque and relative coating thickness for different value of the curve radius of the head of the <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> tooth profile cause an increase of stress in the bottom lands of the toothed ring. Research limitations/implications: The paper presents strength calculations for the teeth in toothed ring of a flexspline of a double harmonic drive by means of boundary elements method (BEM). The results of numerical calculations correspond in terms of their quality to the results presented in the literature, which were calculated by finite element method (FEM). Originality/value: In the analysis of the state of stress of toothed ring of flexspline, the boundary element method (BEM) was applied...|$|E
40|$|After an {{extensive}} {{research on the}} fundamental theory, the theoretical basis for the Logix gearing will be presented in this paper. This includes the theory for gear meshing with high degree of contact. In comparison to previous studies, the theory {{of this paper is}} more restricted going beyond third order parameters into the fourth order, the teeth profile had one order of contact higher than that of the Logix gearing. So that further improved the contact strength of tooth profile. A large category of gearings with high order of contact was presented, while the Logix gear is only one of them, or the special example in realization of my theory. In the Logix gearing, the zigzag curvature center curve of media rack does not always lay about the pitch line and does not extend along the pitch line continuously and steadily. It goes forward and returns. So that, in terms of properties of the transverse engagement, the Logix gearing has not much improvement over the traditional Novikov gearing (in which the transverse engagement is temporally). In my gearing the curvature center of <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> extend along the pitch line continuously and steadily. The transverse engagement factor is larger than that of Logix gearing...|$|E
40|$|The paper embraces three related subjects: Photo-elastic {{measurement}} of stresses in spur gear teeth; interpretation of stresses so found to give revised strength factors for B. S. specification {{on the design}} of spur gears; and a tentative attempt to correlate the stresses found with fatigue-test results which have been reported by various investigators. The object of t h i s paper is to propose maximum safe bending loads which involute spur gears can be allowed to carry. The gears investigated are confined to those which can be generated by standard cutters conforming to the 20 -deg. pressure-angle, B. S. <b>basic</b> <b>rack,</b> without either causing under-cutting near the root or undue pointing of the teeth. The values proposed are based on a photo-elastic investigation carried out by the author under the guidance of Professor W. A. Tuplin, at the Post Graduate School of Applied Mechanics, Sheffield University. Strength factors for spur gears are given in the form of charts. These factors embrace the whole possible range of spur-gear combinations, both with and without addendum corrections. To enable a rational assessment of strength to be made, a list of service factors, as well as a graph correlating bending-fatigue data for three classes of surface finish (ground and polished, shaved, hobbed) are given...|$|E

40|$|This Work Presents The Possibilities Of Percentage Of Reduction In The Root Fillet Stress Of Spur Gear By Introducing Circular Stress Relieving Feature Of Various Sizes At Different Locations. Two Categories Of Systematic Analyses Are Carried Out Using Finite Element Model Of Spur Gear. In The First Category Of Analyses Emphasize Is Given To Determine The Maximum Root Fillet Stress Which Is Required As Reference To Determine The Stress Reduction Factor. In Addition To This, The Effect Of Number Of Teeth, Pressure Angle, And <b>Basic</b> Parameters Of <b>Rack</b> Cutter On Root Fillet Stress Is Investigated. In Second Category Which Is The Prime Focus Of This Work; The Effect Of Introducing Geometric Stress Relief Feature Is Carried Out. Circular Stress Relief Feature Of Different Size At Strategic Locations On A Spur Gear Tooth Are Introduced. This Reduces The Root Fillet Stress. The Magnitude Of The Load Shared By A Gear Tooth Depends On The Position Of The Point Of Contact Of Teeth Engagement Along The Line Of Action. It Also Depends On Contact Ratio. High Contact Ratio Gear Teeth Pairs Are Subjected Low Load In Comparison Low Contact Ratio Gear For Transmitting Same Amount Of Torque. A Tooth Is Released From The Load As Soon As It Disengages With The Mating Gear Tooth And It Is Taken By The Next Conjugate Tooth. Therefore The Gear Teeth Are Subjected Varying (Fatigue) Load. If A Gear Fails By Bending Fatigue, The Failure Is Catastrophic And Occurs With Little Or No Warnings. The Maximum Root Fillet Tensile Stress Is One Of The Key Factors Which Determine The Fatigue Life Of The Gear. Therefore The Magnitude Of The Maximum Value Of The Root Fillet Tensile Stress Can Be Treated As The Index Of Fatigue Life Of Gear. Even Slight Reduction In Root Fillet Stress Leads To A Large Increase In Fatigue Life Of The Gears Designed For The Stress Level Above Endurance Limit. This Type Of Design Consideration Is Very Common, Where Safety And Light Weight Are The Principal Design Criteria. Therefore For All The Reasons Cited Above, This Work Is Of More Practical Importance. The Program Is Coded In ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL). It Automates The Task Of Creation Of Model, Meshing, Applying Boundary Conditions, Choosing The Appropriate Density Of The Mesh Depending On The Stress Gradient. It Also Provides A Means For Defining The Diameter And Location Of The Circular Stress Relief Features...|$|R
