5|$|Deep water coral {{habitats}} {{are also}} threatened by human activities, particularly by indiscriminate trawling. These ecosystems have been little studied, {{but in the}} perpetual darkness and cold temperatures, animals grow and mature slowly and there are relatively fewer fish worth catching than in the sunlit waters above. To what extent deep-water coral reefs provide a safe nursery area for juvenile fish has not been established, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> important for many cold-water species.|$|E
5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea {{was on the other side}} of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E
5|$|Most bats are homeothermic, the {{exception}} being the Vespertilionidae, the Rhinolophidae and the Miniopteridae which extensively use heterothermy. Compared to other mammals, bats {{have a high}} thermal conductivity. Body heat is mainly lost through the wings as they are filled with blood vessels, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used as an insulator while resting. By wrapping their wings around themselves, they can trap a layer of still air around themselves. Smaller bats generally have a higher metabolic rate than larger bats, and so need to consume more food {{in order to maintain}} homeothermy.|$|E

5|$|The rate {{of growth}} of the Antarctic scallop is very slow {{compared}} to that of scallops living in warmer seas. It matures at 5 to 7 years old and spawning takes place in late summer. Little is known about the development of the veliger larvae <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> planktonic for 4 or 5 months. Besides feeding on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, they may absorb dissolved organic matter and consume bacterioplankton. When they settle, metamorphosis takes place and the juveniles attach themselves with byssus threads, often attaching these to the upper valves of scallops, and remain attached for 3 to 5 years. While attached to the adult shell, the juveniles benefit from food particles in the fine detritus thrown up into the water column by movements of the adult. While studying the sizes and growth rates of adults, researchers came to realize that there were gaps in their records which were due to the fact that, in some years, no juveniles had survived.|$|E
25|$|The next oldest {{possible}} animal fossils {{are found}} {{towards the end}} of the Precambrian, around 610 million years ago, and are known as the Ediacaran or Vendian biota. These are difficult to relate to later fossils, however. Some may represent precursors of modern phyla, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> separate groups, and it is possible they are not really animals at all.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} to grow orange trees directly from seeds, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> infertile or produce fruit that may be different from its parent. For the seed of a commercial orange to grow, it must be kept moist at all times. One approach is placing the seeds between two sheets of damp paper towel until they germinate and then planting them, although many cultivators just set the seeds straight into the soil.|$|E
25|$|This {{most common}} form of impetigo, also called nonbullous impetigo, most often begins as a red sore near the nose or mouth which soon breaks, leaking pus or fluid, and forms a honey-colored scab, {{followed}} by a red mark which heals without leaving a scar. Sores are not painful, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> itchy. Lymph nodes in the affected area may be swollen, but fever is rare. Touching or scratching the sores may easily spread the infection {{to other parts of the}} body.|$|E

25|$|Bacon is a {{meat product}} {{prepared}} from cured pork. It is first cured using {{large quantities of}} salt, either a brine or a dry packing. Fresh bacon may then be dried for weeks or months in cold air, {{or it may be}} boiled or smoked. Fresh and dried bacon are typically cooked before eating, often by pan frying. Boiled bacon is ready to eat, as is some smoked bacon, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> cooked further before eating. Bacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat. It can be made from the pork belly or from back cuts, which has less fat than the belly.|$|E
25|$|Anti-nuclear {{ribonucleoprotein}} (anti-nRNP) antibodies, {{also known}} as anti-U1-RNP antibodies, are found in 30–40% of SLE. They are often found with anti-Sm antibodies, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> associated with different clinical associations. In addition to SLE, these antibodies are highly associated with mixed connective tissue disease. Anti-nRNP antibodies recognise the A and C core units of the snRNPs {{and because of this}} they primarily bind to the U1-snRNP. The immune response to RNP may be caused by the presentation of the nuclear components on the cell membrane in apoptotic blebs. Molecular mimicry has also been suggested as a possible mechanism for the production of antibodies to these proteins because of similarity between U1-RNP polypeptides and Epstein-Barr virus polypeptides.|$|E
25|$|Because Switzerland is {{a federal}} state with three {{different}} levels – the Confederation, the 26 cantons and their local communes – non-citizen voting rights vary greatly depending on the individual entity. Foreigners may not cast ballots on the national level, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> entitled to vote and, in some cases, {{to run for office}} on the cantonal or communal level. Five cantons have already recognized the right of foreigners to vote (Neuchâtel, Jura, Vaud in 2003, Fribourg in 2004, Geneva in 2005), plus three, Appenzell Ausserrhoden (1995), Graubünden (2003) and Basel-Stadt (2005) which accord to each municipality the authority to decide on the subject. Some referendums unsuccessfully took place in other cantons.|$|E

25|$|Silicate and {{aluminosilicate}} minerals {{have many}} different structures and varying stoichiometry, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> classified following some general principles. Tetrahedral {SiO4} units {{are common to}} almost all these compounds, either as discrete structures, or combined into larger units by the sharing of corner oxygen atoms. These may be divided into neso-silicates (discrete {SiO4} units) sharing no oxygen atoms, soro-silicates (discrete {Si2O7} units) sharing one, cyclo-silicates (closed ring structures) and ino-silicates (continuous chain or ribbon structures) both sharing two, phyllo-silicates (continuous sheets) sharing three, and tecto-silicates (continuous three-dimensional frameworks) sharing four. The lattice of oxygen atoms that results is usually close-packed or close to it, with the charge being balanced by other cations in various different polyhedral sites according to size.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} 18th century, the Lacandon Jungle and {{bordering}} areas of Guatemala were {{occupied by the}} now-extinct Lakandon Ch'ol., who lived along the tributaries of the upper Usumacinta River and {{the foothills of the}} Sierra de los Cuchumatanes. Most of the Lakandon Ch'ol were forcibly relocated to the Huehuetenango area of Guatemala by the Spanish in the early 18th century. The resettled Lakandon Ch'ol were soon absorbed into the local Maya populations there and ceased to exist as a separate ethnicity. Prior to the Spanish conquest, the Xocmo were a Cholan-speaking group; they occupied the remote forest somewhere to the east of the Lacandon. The Xocmo were never conquered and escaped repeated Spanish attempts to locate them; their eventual fate is unknown <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> ancestors of the modern Lacandon people. After the fall of the Itza capital Nojpetén to the Spanish invaders in 1697, a mix of Itza, Kejache and Kowoj refugees fled into the Lacandon Jungle, where they too became the ancestors of the modern Lacandon people.|$|E

500|$|There {{has been}} much debate over {{the status of the}} quagga in {{relation}} to the plains zebra. It is poorly represented in the fossil record, and the identification of these fossils is uncertain, as they were collected {{at a time when the}} name [...] "quagga" [...] referred to all zebras. Fossil skulls of Equus mauritanicus from Algeria have been claimed to show affinities with the quagga and the plains zebra, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> too badly damaged to allow definite conclusions to be drawn from them. Quaggas have also been identified in cave art attributed to the San. Reginald Innes Pocock was perhaps the first to suggest that the quagga was a subspecies of plains zebra in 1902. As the quagga was scientifically described and named before the plains zebra, the trinomial name for the quagga becomes E. quagga quagga under this scheme, and the other subspecies of plains zebra are placed under E. quagga as well.|$|E
500|$|A key {{concept in}} {{interpreting}} radiocarbon dates is archaeological association: {{what is the}} true relationship between two or more objects at an archaeological site? [...] It frequently happens that a sample for radiocarbon dating can be taken directly from the object of interest, {{but there are also}} many cases where this is not possible. [...] Metal grave goods, for example, cannot be radiocarbon dated, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> found in a grave with a coffin, charcoal, or other material which can be assumed to have been deposited at the same time. [...] In these cases a date for the coffin or charcoal is indicative of the date of deposition of the grave goods, because of the direct functional relationship between the two. [...] There are also cases where there is no functional relationship, but the association is reasonably strong: for example, a layer of charcoal in a rubbish pit provides a date which has a relationship to the rubbish pit.|$|E
500|$|Pulmonary {{contusion}} and laceration are {{injuries to}} the lung tissue. Pulmonary laceration, in which lung tissue is torn or cut, differs from pulmonary contusion {{in that the}} former involves disruption of the macroscopic architecture of the lung, while the latter does not. When lacerations fill with blood, the result is pulmonary hematoma, a collection of blood within the lung tissue. Contusion involves hemorrhage in the alveoli (tiny air-filled sacs responsible for absorbing oxygen), but a hematoma is a discrete clot of blood not interspersed with lung tissue. [...] A collapsed lung can result when the pleural cavity (the space outside the lung) accumulates blood (hemothorax) or air (pneumothorax) or both (hemopneumothorax). These conditions do not inherently involve damage to the lung tissue itself, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> associated with it. [...] Injuries to the chest wall are also distinct from but {{may be associated with}} lung injuries. Chest wall injuries include rib fractures and flail chest, in which multiple ribs are broken so that a segment of the ribcage is detached {{from the rest of the}} chest wall and moves independently.|$|E
