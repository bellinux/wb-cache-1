5000|$|Mass {{production}} of Pitkin watches began in 1836. Pitkin {{with his brother}} designed the first American pocket watches containing the first American machine made parts. The Pitkin Watch Company {{was the first to}} mass-produce pocket watches in America. Pitkin's pocket watches had an excellent reputation for being accurate and durable. The plates for the Pitkins pocket watches were punched out with stamping dies but many times had to be finished to close tolerances by hand. The movements were three-quarter plate, slow train, and about the diameter of the modern 16-size pocket watch. The watch cases they made themselves from gold and silver. They imported from Europe many of the dials, hands, hair springs and balance jewels needed for their watches, even though they tried to avoid using foreign made parts. Pitkin named the first fifty movements after himself, however after that the name H & J. F. Pitkin was used. They did not engrave the place of their production shop on their watches, however the words Detached Lever were put on the <b>balance</b> <b>bridge.</b> [...] Pitkin and his brother made about 800 watches between 1836 and 1841.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Considering the {{scattering}} difference in {{resistance of the}} strain gauge which will cause the bridge unbalance, the designers of strain measurement instrument have to add bridge-balance circuit into the design of measuring bridge in order to eliminate the problem of a DC component output caused by the unbalance. Thus, {{in the design of}} the bridge-balance circuit, the selection of balance resistances is of great significance. In this paper, through calculation analysis of the <b>balance</b> <b>bridge,</b> we obtained a couple of ideal values of balance resistances and tested them by experiments. In this condition, the experimental results have shown that the circuit has a great ability of regulation equilibrium. In brief, this paper provides the designers an effective method of choosing the balance resistances...|$|E

40|$|The cell {{impedance}} analysis {{technique is}} a label-free, non-invasive method, which simplifies sample preparation and allows applications requiring unmodified cell retrieval. However, traditional impedance measurement methods suffer from various problems (speed, bandwidth, accuracy) for extracting the cellular impedance information. This thesis proposes an improved system for extracting precise cellular impedance in real-time, {{with a wide}} bandwidth and satisfactory accuracy. The system hardware consists of five main parts: a microelectrode array (MEA), a stimulation circuit, a sensing circuit, a multi-function card and a computer. The development of system hardware is explored. Accordingly, a novel bioimpedance measurement method coined digital auto <b>balancing</b> <b>bridge</b> method, which is improved from the traditional analogue auto <b>balancing</b> <b>bridge</b> circuitry, is realized for real-time cellular impedance measurement. Two different digital <b>bridge</b> <b>balancing</b> algorithms are proposed and realized, {{which are based on}} least mean squares (LMS) algorithm and fast block LMS (FBLMS) algorithm for single- and multi-frequency measurements respectively. Details on their implementation in FPGA are discussed. The test results prove that the LMS-based algorithm is suitable for accelerating the measurement speed in single-frequency situation, whilst the FBLMS-based algorithm has advantages in stable convergence in multi-frequency applications. A novel algorithm, called the All Phase Fast Fourier Transform (APFFT), is applied for post-processing of bioimpedance measurement results. Compared with the classical FFT algorithm, the APFFT significantly reduces spectral leakage caused by truncation error. Compared to the traditional FFT and Digital Quadrature Demodulation (DQD) methods, the APFFT shows excellent performance for extracting accurate phase and amplitude in the frequency spectrum. Additionally, testing and evaluation of the realized system has been performed. The results show that our system achieved a satisfactory accuracy within a wide bandwidth, a fast measurement speed and a good repeatability. Furthermore, our system is compared with a commercial impedance analyzer (Agilent 4294 A) in biological experiments. The results reveal that our system achieved a comparable accuracy to the commercial instrument in the biological experiments. Finally, conclusions are given and the future work is proposed...|$|R
