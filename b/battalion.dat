5|$|A ruined castle {{dominated}} the ridge across which the coastal pass led to Platamon. During {{the night of}} 15 April, a German motorcycle <b>battalion</b> supported by a tank <b>battalion</b> attacked the ridge, but the Germans were repulsed by the New Zealand 21st <b>Battalion</b> under Lieutenant Colonel Neil Macky, which suffered heavy losses in the process. Later that day, a German armoured regiment arrived and struck the coastal and inland flanks of the <b>battalion,</b> but the New Zealanders held. After being reinforced during {{the night of the}} 15th–16th, the Germans assembled a tank <b>battalion,</b> an infantry <b>battalion</b> and a motorcycle <b>battalion.</b> The infantry attacked the New Zealanders' left company at dawn, while the tanks attacked along the coast several hours later. The New Zealanders soon found themselves enveloped on both sides, after the failure of the Western Macedonia Army to defend the Albanian town of Koritsa that fell unopposed to the Italian 9th Army on 15 April, forcing the British to abandon the Mount Olympus position and resulting in the capture of 20,000 Greek troops.|$|E

5|$|Activated {{to oversee}} {{division}} elements prior to World War II, the <b>battalion</b> fought in Italy for a year. After the war {{it served as}} the command element for the 10th {{when it was a}} training unit. Due to reorganizations in the Army, the Special Troops <b>Battalion</b> was not reactivated with the 10th Mountain Division in 1985, and instead remained inactive while the division served in numerous contingencies throughout the 1990s. Reactivated during another reorganization in 2004, the Special Troops <b>Battalion</b> supported the 10th Mountain Division command elements when they deployed to both Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. During this service, it has received several commendations for its multiple deployments. In October 2009, the Special Troops <b>Battalion</b> was redesignated to Headquarters and Headquarters <b>Battalion,</b> 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry).|$|E
5|$|Advancing in bounds, occupying company {{bases and}} sending out patrols, the <b>battalion</b> began its move south on 15 January 1945. Throughout {{the rest of}} the month, the <b>battalion</b> was {{involved}} in a number of relatively minor engagements with the Japanese as they carried out patrolling and ambush operations along the Australian line of advance. By the start of February they reached Mosina and after receiving intelligence that a Japanese force had been detected at Warapa, they sent out to raid their camp. Upon reaching Warapa the patrol set fire to the huts in which the Japanese force was billeted and then withdrew. Later reconnaissance determined that 15 Japanese had died in the blaze. By 12 February the <b>battalion</b> married up with patrols from the 25th <b>Battalion</b> that were moving along the Tavera River and then later, as the <b>battalion</b> continued on towards Mosigetta, one company linked up with patrols from the 9th <b>Battalion</b> on 17 February.|$|E
5|$|After Gallipoli the 7th <b>Battalion</b> was {{withdrawn}} to Egypt, where the AIF underwent {{a period of}} reorganisation and expansion prior to being transferred to Europe. The 7th <b>Battalion</b> was split to provide a cadre for the 59th <b>Battalion</b> which was being raised {{as part of the}} doubling of the Australian forces. In March 1916, they sailed to France where for the next two and half years they would take part in the fighting in the trenches along the Western Front. Upon arrival, the <b>battalion</b> was sent to the Somme, where its first major action came in July during the Battle of Pozières. Throughout July and into August, the <b>battalion</b> was committed to the fighting twice, losing 55 men killed in the first battle and another 83 in the second.|$|E
5000|$|Most regiments had two regular <b>battalions,</b> {{supported}} by associated <b>battalions</b> from the Territorial Force ('part-time' soldiers) and Reserve <b>Battalions.</b> After {{the start of}} the war, many new <b>battalions</b> were raised and called [...] "Service Battalions".

The U.S. Army Area Handbook for Somalia, 1977 edition, agreed that the army comprised six tank and nine mechanised infantry <b>battalions,</b> but listed no infantry <b>battalions,</b> the two commando <b>battalions,</b> and 10 total artillery (five field and five anti-aircraft) <b>battalions.</b> (Kaplan et al., DA Pam 550-86, Second Edition, 1977, p.315) ...|$|R
5|$|After Martin's death, the 3rd <b>Battalion,</b> 34th Infantry {{began to}} buckle as {{increasing}} numbers of North Korean troops flooded into Chonan from the Northwest and eastern roads. The <b>battalion</b> suffered heavy casualties, but was saved by the continuous fire laid down by the 63rd Field Artillery <b>Battalion.</b> Between 0800 and 1000, U.S. units began a disorganized retreat from the town, many soldiers deserting their units and running from the battle. Wadlington, now {{in command of the}} 34th Infantry, moved 3rd <b>Battalion</b> to a collecting point south of the town, where 1st <b>Battalion,</b> 34th Infantry was holding a blocking position and had not been engaged. As 3rd <b>Battalion,</b> 34th Infantry began to pull back to rally points, 1st <b>Battalion</b> began to come under mortar fire from North Korean forces, but withdrew without engaging them.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving through}} torrential rain, the <b>battalion</b> reached Elephant Point at 16:00, and close-quarters {{fighting}} then took place, with flame-throwers being used against several Japanese bunkers guarding the battery. About forty Japanese soldiers and gunners were {{killed during the}} assault, and the <b>battalion</b> also sustained several casualties. After the battery had been secured the <b>battalion</b> dug in around Elephant Point and awaited {{the arrival of the}} relief force, which landed at Thaungang at 15:30, with a supply drop following it several minutes later. As it neared the position of the <b>battalion,</b> the surgical team accompanying the relief force was accidentally fired upon by the Gurkhas, causing four members of the team to be wounded. The <b>battalion</b> remained where it was through the night, although high tides submerged a number of trenches and forced the <b>battalion</b> to higher ground. By the dawn of 2 May, after it had cleared a number of nearby bunkers, the <b>battalion</b> was able to watch as minesweepers cleared the Rangoon river for the columns of landing craft following behind them.|$|E
5|$|After {{the brigade}} had been disbanded in June 1948, its battalions were reformed, by {{renumbering}} {{those in the}} 2nd Parachute Brigade. The 5th (Scottish) Parachute <b>Battalion</b> became the 2nd Parachute <b>Battalion,</b> the 4th/6th Parachute <b>Battalion</b> the 1st Parachute <b>Battalion,</b> and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute <b>Battalion</b> the 3rd Parachute <b>Battalion.</b> Finally, in July 1948, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was renumbered the 16th Parachute Brigade Group, taking its one and six numbers from the two wartime divisions.|$|E
50|$|The reserve <b>battalions</b> of the {{regiment}} were also reorganised in 1908 by the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, {{with the two}} militia <b>battalions</b> being re-designated the 3rd (Special) and 4th (Special Reserve) <b>battalions,</b> and the volunteer <b>battalions</b> being re-designated as Territorial Force and renumbered as the 5th and 6th <b>battalions</b> (TF).|$|R

5|$|After the {{garrison}} of Nevesinje had been relieved, Laxa directed his main effort towards the Gacko and Avtovac districts. Sensitive {{to the fact}} that the Italians had not respected the territorial borders of the NDH when they sent their column to Gacko, he considered it very important that Croatian military and political prestige be restored, otherwise the Italians might decide to remain in the area rather than withdraw to their garrison near the Adriatic coast. He planned to follow this consolidation by clearing the border areas with Montenegro then clearing the hinterland of any remaining rebels. For this last task he intended to deploy a yet-to-be-formed special unit to be led by Lieutenant Colonel Josip Metzger. The task of re-asserting NDH authority in the Gacko and Avtovac districts was allocated to Prohaska's group, consisting of the 6th <b>Battalion,</b> one company of the 18th <b>Battalion,</b> two companies of the 17th <b>Battalion,</b> and the recently arrived 15th and 21st Battalions, which were to be sent to Nevesinje from Mostar. Prohaska was to act in concert with the 11th <b>Battalion</b> who were already in the vicinity of Plužine, just to the north of the Nevesinje–Gacko road. In preparation, the 15th <b>Battalion</b> was trucked to Nevesinje, and a company of the 17th <b>Battalion</b> conducted a coordinated attack with the 11th <b>Battalion</b> on rebel positions near Kifino Selo. This attack was defeated by the rebels, and a <b>battalion</b> commander was killed.|$|E
5|$|After the inactivation, the Regiment {{was broken}} up and its {{subordinate}} elements were redesignated. The regimental Headquarters and Headquarters Company and Service Company were reorganized on 25 February 1949 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 411th Engineer Brigade, allowing them a larger staff {{with the ability}} to take command of more subordinate units. The regiment's 1st <b>Battalion</b> was reorganized and redesignated on 25 February 1949 as the 928th Engineer Construction <b>Battalion.</b> The 2nd <b>Battalion</b> was reorganized and redesignated on 15 March 1949 as the 929th Engineer Construction <b>Battalion.</b> The 3rd <b>Battalion</b> disbanded on 9 July 1953. The two separated battalions retained separate lineage from this point and the 355th Engineer Regiment ceased to exist.|$|E

5|$|After the war {{the brigade}} {{comprised}} the 1st, 2nd, 17th Parachute Battalions and the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance. The 3rd Parachute <b>Battalion</b> {{had left to}} join the 3rd Parachute Brigade, replacing the 1st Canadian Parachute <b>Battalion,</b> who had returned to Canada at the cessation of hostilities. The 1st Airborne Division was disbanded in November 1945, and the brigade assigned to the 6th Airborne Division in Palestine. In 1946 the 17th Parachute <b>Battalion</b> amalgamated with the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute <b>Battalion</b> retaining {{the number of the}} senior unit. The brigade formation changed again in 1948. Further amalgamations and the general reduction in the post war British Army resulted in the brigade being formed from the 1st Parachute <b>Battalion,</b> the amalgamated 2nd/3rd Parachute <b>Battalion</b> and the amalgamated 8th/9th Parachute <b>Battalion.</b> By July 1948 the 6th Airborne Division had been withdrawn to England and disbanded, leaving the 2nd Parachute Brigade as the only regular British Army parachute formation.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the <b>battalion</b> {{remained}} in the Kairivu area throughout September and into early October, when {{the majority of the}} <b>battalion</b> moved back to Wewak. Patrols were sent out into the surrounding areas as Japanese soldiers were brought in for surrender and repatriation. Meanwhile, the demobilisation process began with high priority long service troops being repatriated to Australia in drafts as shipping became available. At this time, some of the battalion's personnel volunteered for service in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The majority of these were transferred to the 67th Infantry <b>Battalion,</b> although some also served in the 66th Infantry <b>Battalion.</b> By November, the <b>battalion</b> was down to a posted strength of just 375 personnel. On 18 December 1945, the remaining cadre of the <b>battalion</b> embarked for Australia. As personnel marched out of the unit – either for demobilisation or for subsequent service – and equipment was handed back, the unit was disbanded at Puckapunyal in February 1946.|$|E
5|$|Although disbanded in 1919 {{following}} {{the end of}} hostilities, it was re-raised in 1921 in the Citizens Force (later known as the Militia) as a part-time infantry <b>battalion</b> based in Victoria. However, due to lack of funding {{following the}} Great Depression and a shortage of manpower following the suspension of the compulsory training scheme in 1929, the <b>battalion</b> was amalgamated with the 38th <b>Battalion</b> as the 7th/38th <b>Battalion,</b> although it was delinked again in 1936 when the Army was expanded due to rising tensions in Europe.|$|E
