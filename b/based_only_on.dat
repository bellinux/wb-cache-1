A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have similar limitations in those with HIV.|$|E

5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{consists of an}} array of cells, each one of which has {{a finite number of}} possible states, together with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously <b>based</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> the states of neighboring cells. A configuration of a {{cellular automaton}} is an assignment of a state to every cell of the automaton; the update rule of a cellular automaton forms a function from configurations to configurations, with the requirement that the updated value of any cell depends only on some finite neighborhood of the cell, and that the function is invariant under translations of the input array.|$|E
5|$|<b>Based</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> {{uncertain}} {{descriptions of}} the first practical telescope which Hans Lippershey tried to patent in the Netherlands in 1608, Galileo, in the following year, made a telescope with about 3x magnification. He later made improved versions with up to about 30x magnification. With a Galilean telescope, the observer could see magnified, upright images on the earth—it was what {{is commonly known as}} a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass. He could also use it to observe the sky; for a time {{he was one of those}} who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose. On 25 August 1609, he demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of about 8 or 9, to Venetian lawmakers. His telescopes were also a profitable sideline for Galileo, who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger).|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{historian}} Plamen Pavlov conjectures that Ivan the Russian was a Ruthenian {{born in the}} Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia (centred {{on modern}} western Ukraine), a hypothesis <b>based</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> his ties to Hungary, the western neighbour of Galicia–Volhynia. Hungarian sources from 1288 make notice of one Russian named Ivan (Iwan dicto Oroz) as an ally of the ban of Severin, Theodore Vejtehi from the kindred Csanád, {{who was one of}} the nobles that opposed the rule of Charles I of Hungary in 1316–1317. The land to the south of Severin was governed for Bulgaria by the despot of Vidin, Michael Shishman, a supporter of Vejtehi. Thus, as the Hungarian king established his authority over Severin and suppressed Vejtehi's rebellion, Ivan the Russian may have fled to Vidin and entered the service of Michael Shishman. Ivan is thought to have been joined, as a commander subordinate to the despot of Vidin, by his personal forces which consisted of Hungarians and, presumably, Russians.|$|E

Similarly, in Samson v. California (2006), the Court ruled that government offices may be searched for evidence of work-related misconduct by government employees on similar grounds.

5|$|Many {{hypothetical}} extinct macaws were <b>based</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> contemporaneous accounts, {{but these}} species are considered dubious today. Several {{of them were}} named in the early 20th century by Rothschild, who {{had a tendency to}} name species based on little tangible evidence. Among others, the red-headed macaw (Ara erythrocephala) and the Jamaican red macaw (Ara gossei) were named for accounts of macaws on Jamaica, and the Dominican green-and-yellow macaw (Ara atwoodi) was supposedly from Dominica island. The violet macaw (Anodorhynchus purpurascens), which was named for accounts of blue parrots supposedly from Guadeloupe, is now thought to have been based on references to the Guadeloupe amazon (Amazona violacea).|$|E
5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted <b>based</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of February, Faryl was placed at 295 in Amazon.co.uk's best-sellers chart and 13 in its easy listening chart, based on pre-orders alone. A week before its release, the album was in the top 100 selling albums, and was the top-selling opera album. Retailers in the UK ordered more than 80,000 copies of the album in the week leading up to release, which Simon Cable, writing for the Daily Mail, noted was more than U2's recent No Line on the Horizon. It also topped the Amazon.co.uk presale chart. On {{the day of the}} release, <b>based</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> presales, the album was at the number 1 spot on the UK Albums Chart. The album became the fastest-selling classical solo album in Britain, beating Hayley Westenra's Pure, selling 20,000 copies in the first four days. The first week resulted in sales of 29,200 copies, which is higher than any other debut album of a classical singer. Faryl officially entered the UK Albums Chart at number 6, and climbed to number 4 the following week. Faryl made Smith the third former Britain's Got Talent contestant to achieve a top ten album, after Paul Potts (with One Chance) and Andrew Johnston (with One Voice). In the US, Faryl peaked at 31 on Top Heatseekers Albums chart, and at 6 on the Classical Albums chart, remaining in the charts for one and 17 weeks respectively. By February 2010, over 160,000 copies of Faryl had been sold, with over 150,000 of these in the UK. In July 2013, the British Phonographic Industry certified the album gold, denoting shipments of over 100,000 units in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Henry Walter Bates: (1825–1892) was an English explorer-naturalist who {{surveyed}} the Amazon rainforest with Alfred Russel Wallace in 1848. While Wallace returned in 1852, Bates remained {{for over a}} decade. His field research included collecting almost a hundred species of butterflies from the families Ithomiinae and Heliconiinae, as well as thousands of other insects specimens. In sorting these butterflies into similar groups based on appearance, inconsistencies began to arise. Some appeared superficially similar to others, even {{so much so that}} Bates could not tell some species apart <b>based</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> wing appearance. However, closer examination of less obvious morphological characters seemed to show that they were not even closely related. Shortly after his return to England he read a paper on his theory of mimicry {{at a meeting of the}} Linnean Society of London on 21 November 1861, which was then published in 1862 as 'Contributions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley' in the society's Transactions. He elaborated on his experiences further in The Naturalist on the River Amazons.|$|E

On the base of the data about the composition of the gaseous products of the thermal decay, the diagrams of the thermal decay of six beta -diketonates of copper(II) and two complexes of lead(II) on the heated surface have been offered. The effective values of the kinetic parameters of the thermal decay have been designed. The quantitatively new information has been obtained about the processes of interaction of acetylacetonate, dipivaloilmethanate, pivaloiltrifluoracetonate, pivapoilacetonate of copper (II) with the surface of the thermal reactor. For the first time, the influence of the oxide surface on the process of the thermal decay of beta -diketonates of metals has been revealed.
