40|$|In {{this article}} we argue that the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of a central bank {{contains}} valuable information {{for the quality of}} a currency. As an illustration we analyze the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of the Federal Reserve System (FED) during the subprime crisis between June 2007 and December 2008. Until September 2008 the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of the FED did not expand strongly. However, the structure of the FED assets varied pronouncedly. Starting in September 2008 the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> expanded dramatically. The calculation of certain <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> ratios supports the assessment of an important decrease {{of the quality of the}} currency.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the speaker or writer should either say technical insolvency or actual insolvency in order to always be clear - where technical insolvency is a synonym for <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>insolvency,</b> which means that its liabilities are greater than its assets, and actual insolvency is a synonym for the first definition of insolvency ("Insolvency is the inability of a debtor to pay their debt.").|$|E
5000|$|When {{a company}} goes into {{insolvent}} liquidation, any mutual debts between {{the company and}} a creditor intending to prove in the liquidation will be set-off.

Any creditor who extended credit to the company {{at a time when}} it had notice of the company's insolvency (excluding <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>insolvency</b> for these purposes) cannot set-off.

30|$|In his seminal {{paper on}} {{corporate}} insolvency, Armour (2001) makes {{a distinction between}} six different meanings of the term ‘insolvency’. Departing from the colloquial {{sense of the word}} {{that has to do with}} an inability to pay creditors, he attempts to clarify between the accounting concepts of <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>insolvency,</b> cash flow insolvency, and economic failure on the one hand and the judicial aspects of default that follow a path from insolvency proceedings and reorganization to liquidation on the other. This extensive approach to firms in distress presents the huge advantage of encompassing the diversity of possible judgments made by commercial courts in cases of corporate insolvencya. Moreover, such a complex and refined typology of failure is hardly compatible with an empirical analysis of the phenomenon which is most of the time centered on the determination of a discriminant function able to distinguish two classes of firms according to their respective economic health (Rahman et al. 2004; Bose and Pal 2006). The problems emerge because corporate insolvency is still missing a general definition broadly accepted by the community of authors working on this topic.|$|E
40|$|The new {{second edition}} of Debt Restructuring {{provides}} detailed legal analysis of international corporate, banking, and sovereign debt restructuring, {{from the perspective}} of both creditors and debtors. It sets out practical guidance to help practitioners, policy-makers and academics to understand current developments in debt restructuring, and provides solutions for creditors holding distressed debt and debtor options in a distressed scenario. The Corporate Debt section includes a number of very significant changes such as the UK Supreme Court decision in Eurosail and the disapproval of the "point of no return" test for <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>insolvency</b> or the endorsement of the Cheyne Finance decision on cashflow. The changes in treatment of schemes of arrangement since with the decision in Rodenstock are reflected as are the Recast European Insolvency Regulation (EIR) and the Supreme Court decision in Rubin. In the US chapter the new edition considers the limitations on bankruptcy court jurisdiction in Stern v. Marshall and, in the RadLax case, the right of secured creditors to credit bid in a sale of their collateral under a chapter 11 plan. Other significant case law includes consideration of the various safe harbour provisions of the Bankruptcy Code relating to derivative and other financial instruments and cases concerning the effect of foreign court orders in the US [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} draw {{lessons from the}} IMF’s {{experience}} in handling financial crises around the globe {{over the past ten}} years that are relevant to the challenges faced by countries in Latin America, especially in the wake of the recent crisis in Argentina. Experience suggests that there is no quick or easy fix in the face of a wide-ranging crisis involving both acute external financing pressures and rapidly changing asset prices that undermine financial stability and household and corporate balance sheets. In the end, effective solutions depend on developing a comprehensive strategy combining the full range of fiscal, monetary, financial system, and debt policy instruments. Recent experience with crises has had important implications for the IMF’s work in assessing crisis vulnerabilities. IMF surveillance work has been strengthened and a more objective framework has been developed for assessing debt sustainability, and this approach continues to be refined.
