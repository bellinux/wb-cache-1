5|$|Super Smash Bros. Brawl, which Project M modifies, is a {{fighting}} game with an unconventional battle system. Players battle in arenas of varying sizes {{and levels of}} complexity, controlling characters {{with a variety of}} play styles. They can attack one another with their own repertoires of special moves, or with a basic attack. Attacks can be avoided by jumping or using a short-lived shield move. Unlike most fighting games, Brawl does not include standard health gauges, but a percentage counter; there is no point at which a character is automatically knocked out from the counter getting too high, but they will be knocked farther with increasing damage. Being knocked off the screen—or falling off oneself—causes a knock-out. Players may use items for offensive purposes, such as guns and swords, or for healing purposes, such as food and heart containers. The stages, characters, and items are drawn from Nintendo's video game franchises such as Mario, Pokémon, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid, along with Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series and Konami's Metal Gear series. The victor of a match has no standard determining factor. Rather, depending on the settings, victory may <b>be</b> <b>reached,</b> <b>for</b> example, by being the last player alive using a stock system, or by achieving the most KOs after a set amount of time.|$|E

No agreement could <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> a permanent successor, and no further Congresses were held. Its role was surpassed {{by a number of}} Palestinian Arab political parties representing the interests of particular families and individuals, or identifying with specific locations: the Istiqlal (1932), National Defence Party (1934), Arab Reform Party (1935), National Bloc Party (1935) and the Palestine Arab Party (1935). In 1932 a small group was formed in the Jaffa-Ramleh area, the Palestine Youth Party.|$|E
25|$|Each {{character}} class features special abilities unique to that class, {{as well as}} a shared set of attributes which can be developed by performing tasks and completing quests. In general, for a particular game the maximum value which can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> an ability is 100*. Quest for Glory V allows stat bonuses which can push an attribute over the maximum and lets certain classes raise certain attributes beyond the normal limits. Quest for Glory V also features special kinds of equipment which lower some stats while raising others. At the beginning of each game, the player may assign points to certain attributes, and certain classes only have specific attributes enabled, although skills can be added for an extra cost.|$|E
500|$|In June, NYC Ferry had {{to charter}} two 400-passenger charter boats for the East Ferry route to {{alleviate}} crowding on the routes serving Governors Island while packed boats skipped stops along these routes. By June 22, the ferry had carried 500,000 passengers, a milestone officials {{had not expected}} to <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> several months. Due to unexpected demand, crowding became worse as the summer of 2017 progressed, with packed-to-capacity boats and long waits becoming more common. , there were an estimated 83,500 riders on the South Brooklyn route in one month, exceeding the original ridership estimate by more than 30,000. The East River ferry saw about 7,200 riders per average weekday since being taken over by NYC Ferry, up from 3,257 average weekday riders in 2013. That month, three new boats being built were also revised to fit more passengers (see [...] for more details). A 500-passenger boat was also borrowed from SeaStreak for the Rockaway route. By July 26, 2017, NYC Ferry had carried 1 million riders.|$|E

500|$|The rise of {{the motor}} vehicle era in the early 20th century saw the road gain {{prominence}} once more. The newly formed Main Roads Board took over control and maintenance of the Perth–Albany road and twenty-one other important roads between 1926 and 1928, which were declared [...] "main roads". At this stage the Perth–Albany road was not much more developed than a bush track. To increase the usability of the overall main road network, the Board's work schedule prioritised upgrading the worst individual segments, rather than any one road. In 1928/29, twenty-two separate sections of the Perth–Albany road were improved, but many were short, and drivers would experience quite varied conditions, from new sealed road to gravel road, and then a boggy dirt in just a few miles. By 1932, the improved conditions allowed an average speed of [...] to <b>be</b> <b>reached,</b> <b>for</b> a total trip of eight to nine hours instead of two days. In 1938, a total of [...] had been sealed, and the following year the whole route had been completed.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2010 the Hells Angels filed {{a lawsuit}} against Alexander McQueen for [...] "misusing its {{trademark}} winged death heads symbol" [...] in several items from its Autumn/Winter 2010 collection. The lawsuit is also aimed at Saks Fifth Avenue and Zappos.com, which stock the jacquard box dress and knuckle duster ring that bear the symbol, which has been used since at least 1948 and is protected by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A handbag and scarf was also named in lawsuit. The lawyer representing Hells Angels claimed [...] "This isn't just about money, it's about membership. If you've got one of these rings on, a member might get really upset that you're an impostor." [...] Saks refused to comment, Zappos had no immediate comment and the company's parent company, PPR, could not <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> comment. The company settled the case with the Hells Angels after agreeing to remove all of the merchandise featuring the logo from sale on their website, stores and concessions and recalling any of the goods that have already been sold and destroying them.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{greatest}} number of human beings noble and happy." [...] But is the nobleness consistent with the number? Yes, not only consistent with it, but essential to it. The maximum of life can only be reached by the maximum of virtue. In this respect the law of human population differs wholly from that of animal life. The multiplication of animals is checked only by want of food, and by the hostility of races; {{the population of the}} gnat is restrained by the hunger of the swallow, and that of the swallow by the scarcity of gnats. Man, considered as an animal, is indeed limited by the same laws: hunger, or plague, or war, are the necessary and only restraints upon his increase,--effectual restraints hitherto,--his principal study having been how most swiftly to destroy himself, or ravage his dwelling-places, and his highest skill directed to give range to the famine, seed to the plague, and sway to the sword. But, considered as other than an animal, his increase is not limited by these laws. It is limited only by the limits of his courage and his love. Both of these have their bounds; and ought to have: his race has its bounds also; but these have not yet been reached, nor will <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> ages.|$|E
60|$|To make Table 7.I. quite satisfactory, {{it ought}} to have been shown that in the eight first birds the leg-bones have not {{actually}} increased in weight out of due proportion {{with the rest of the}} body; this I cannot show, from not knowing, as already remarked, the weight of the wild Bankiva. (7/74. Mr. Blyth (in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 2nd series volume 1 1848 page 456) gives 3 1/4 pounds as the weight of a full-grown male G. bankiva; but from what I have seen of the skins and skeletons of various breeds, I cannot believe that my two specimens of G. bankiva could have weighed so much.) I am indeed inclined to suspect that the leg-bones in the Dorking, No. 2 in the table, are proportionally too heavy; but this bird was a very large one, weighing 7 pounds 2 ounces, though very thin. Its leg-bones were more than ten times as heavy as those of the Burmese Jumper! I tried to ascertain the length both of the leg-bones and wing-bones relatively to other parts of the body and skeleton: but the whole organisation in these birds, which have been so long domesticated, has become so variable, that no certain conclusions could <b>be</b> <b>reached.</b> <b>For</b> instance, the legs of the above Dorking cock were nearly three-quarters of an inch too short relatively to the length of the sternum, and more than three-quarters of an inch too long relatively to the length of the skull, in comparison with these same parts in G. bankiva.|$|E
6000|$|She {{could not}} have said this two days later--for instance, on Tuesday, when she at last {{received}} a letter from Morris Townsend. It was an epistle of considerable length, measuring five large square pages, and written at Philadelphia. It was an explanatory document, and it explained a great many things, chief among which were the considerations that had led the writer to take advantage of an urgent [...] "professional" [...] absence to try and banish from his mind the image of one whose path he had crossed only to scatter it with ruins. He ventured to expect but partial success in this attempt, but he could promise her that, whatever his failure, he would never again interpose between her generous heart and her brilliant prospects and filial duties. He closed with an intimation that his professional pursuits might compel him to travel for some months, and with the hope that when they should each have accommodated themselves to what was sternly involved in their respective positions--even should this result not <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> years--they should meet as friends, as fellow-sufferers, as innocent but philosophic victims of a great social law. That her life should be peaceful and happy was the dearest wish of him who ventured still to subscribe himself her most obedient servant. The letter was beautifully written, and Catherine, who kept it for many years after this, was able, when her sense of the bitterness of its meaning and the hollowness of its tone had grown less acute, to admire its grace of expression. At present, {{for a long time after}} she received it, all she had to help her was the determination, daily more rigid, to make no appeal to the compassion of her father.|$|E
