50|$|It is {{possible}} to use a simple <b>breakout</b> <b>cable</b> to connect a D-Terminal connector to a standard 3 RCA jack or BNC component connection.|$|E
50|$|C2T, {{built into}} some of the IBM's xSeries and Netfinity models, allows daisy-chaining up to forty-two {{compatible}} servers in a single rack. Servers are daisy-chained using a special purpose cable which is included with new servers. The final server in the stack is connected to a monitor/keyboard/mouse or a KVM switch using a C2T <b>breakout</b> <b>cable,</b> which provides PS/2 and VGA connectors. The <b>breakout</b> <b>cable</b> was once very expensive to purchase new, but are now obtainable for less than $30 USD online.|$|E
50|$|Breakout-style fiberoptic cable (also called <b>breakout</b> <b>cable</b> or fanout cable), is {{an optical}} fiber cable {{containing}} several jacketed simplex optical fibers packaged together inside an outer jacket. This differs from distribution-style cable, in which tight-buffered fibers are bundled together, with only the outer cable jacket of the cable protecting them. The design of breakout-style cable adds strength for ruggedized drops, however the cable is larger and more expensive than distribution-style cable. <b>Breakout</b> <b>cable</b> is suitable for short riser and plenum applications and also for use in conduits, where a very simple cable run is planned to avoid {{the use of any}} splicebox or spliced fiber pigtails.|$|E
5000|$|The QSFP28 {{standard}} {{is designed to}} carry 100 Gigabit Ethernet, EDR InfiniBand. or 32G Fibre Channel.This transceiver type is also used with direct-attach <b>breakout</b> <b>cables</b> to adapt a single 100GbE port to four independent 25 gigabit ethernet ports (QSFP28-to-4x-SFP28). Sometimes this transceiver type is {{also referred to as}} [...] "QSFP100" [...] or [...] "100G QSFP" [...] for sake of simplicity.|$|R
50|$|Amphenol Socapex {{is still}} {{manufacturing}} and selling the original Socapex. The company also manufacturers {{a wider range}} of robust multi-way electrical connectors available in various standard and custom configurations. These are used for other high-current applications within live events; commonly for trunk cables to connect PA speakers or stage wedges to amplifiers, usually using breakin and <b>breakout</b> <b>cables</b> to NL2/NL4/NL8 or EP5. While some companies use Socapex as a rigging motor power cable, this is generally not recommended as differences in voltage (i.e., 400 V vs. 230 V) can be misinterpreted, causing extensive equipment damage.|$|R
5000|$|For use in more strenuous environments, a {{much more}} robust cable {{construction}} is required. In loose-tube construction the fiber is laid helically into semi-rigid tubes, allowing the cable to stretch without stretching the fiber itself. This protects the fiber from tension during laying and due to temperature changes. Loose-tube fiber may be [...] "dry block" [...] or gel-filled. Dry block offers less protection to the fibers than gel-filled, but costs considerably less. Instead of a loose tube, the fiber may be embedded in a heavy polymer jacket, commonly called [...] "tight buffer" [...] construction. Tight buffer cables are offered {{for a variety of}} applications, but the two most common are [...] "Breakout" [...] and [...] "Distribution". <b>Breakout</b> <b>cables</b> normally contain a ripcord, two non-conductive dielectric strengthening members (normally a glass rod epoxy), an aramid yarn, and 3 mm buffer tubing with an additional layer of Kevlar surrounding each fiber. The ripcord is a parallel cord of strong yarn that is situated under the jacket(s) of the cable for jacket removal. Distribution cables have an overall Kevlar wrapping, a ripcord, and a 900 micrometer buffer coating surrounding each fiber. These fiber units are commonly bundled with additional steel strength members, again with a helical twist to allow for stretching.|$|R
50|$|The term {{breakout}} box {{is derived from}} the mechanical enclosure in which a connector's aggregate connections are separated (i.e., broken out) into individual signal or current carrying wires or cables. Often, if {{there are only a few}} connections, then a <b>breakout</b> <b>cable</b> (also called an octopus cable) may be used, as is common on notebook computers.|$|E
50|$|VIVO {{is found}} {{predominantly}} on high-end ATI video cards, {{although a few}} high-end NVIDIA video cards also have this port. VIVO on these graphics cards typically supports Composite, S-Video, and Component as outputs, and composite and S-Video as inputs. Many other video cards only support component and/or S-Video outputs to complement Video Graphics Array or DVI, typically using a component <b>breakout</b> <b>cable</b> and an S-Video cable.|$|E
50|$|Using the {{connector}} {{may require}} a <b>breakout</b> <b>cable</b> or special headset. Most often, the user must buy a special adapter or pigtail to make the correct connections to a 2.5mm TRS connector for a monophonic headset or 3.5mm for stereo headphones. True breakout cables which provide all connections are unavailable, thus a phone cannot be charged {{at the same time}} as a headset or headphones are inserted, even for EMUs with extra pins.|$|E
40|$|Introduction When {{properly}} maintained, cyclotrons often {{remain in}} operation for 20 years and more. However, {{as the years}} pass the control systems in particular become challenging to support. The I/O cards and other hardware eventually become obsolete, making spare parts difficult or even impossible to find. And the knowledge and ability to reload and configure the software also gets lost as operating systems and media storage technology change. This obsolescence {{is true of the}} Siemens RDS- 112 cyclotron, which is controlled using a 486 computer, connected to an external STD card rack containing up to 15 I/O cards. These I/O cards were last manufactured in the 1990 â€™s, and the iRMX-based control programs malfunction on computers newer than a 486 processor. A control system upgrade for the RDS- 112 cyclotron has been developed by PET Technical Consulting Inc. This commercially available control system reduces operator training time, requires less maintenance, and supports new targets and custom product processes. Material and Methods The availability of high channel count I/O cards, and the decision not to support the old CPCU synthesis units, means the entire STD card rack can be replaced with 5 National Instruments (NI) I/O cards. The replacement computer is an industrial grade rack mounted PC with RAID 1 mirrored pair hard drives in front panel access quick swap bays. Two NI PCI- 6509 Digital I/O cards connect directly to the RDS electronics, channel assignments are mapped using software configuration. Three NI PCI- 6229 Multifunction I/O cards connect to the RDS electronics through a <b>cable</b> <b>breakout</b> interface plate, the terminal blocks are wired as needed to map the channels. The new control software was created using National Instruments LabVIEW. The new control sequences have a core based on the original RDS- 112 FORTRAN control programs. Then hundreds of improvements were made to simplify operation, increase flexibility, minimize user involvement and mistakes, and clearly display key parameters and fault conditions. System control has been combined into a comprehensive Graphical User Interface, with controls and indicators grouped together onto subsystem pages. Commands that once needed to be typed-in have been replaced with a clickable control for each function. Bar graphs display target and slit currents. Status is obvious with red faults against normally green indicators. Audio alarms cue the operator for process interaction, warn if target current or pressure drifts from setpoint, or if faults occur with power supplies, vacuum, or water cooling. Improvements in sequences and beam algorithms have reduced the time to achieve full beam on dual targets from 10 minutes down to 3 minutes. Results and Conclusion This new control system has been installed on (5) five RDS- 112 cyclotrons used for commercial isotope distribution. The total combined operation time of these systems after receiving the upgrade is now over 17 years, during this time the control system operation has been nearly problem free. UPDATE: The Siemens RDS- 111 cyclotron is controlled by a VME computer that is now end-of-life. The VM 30 and VM 42 CPU boards and many of the I/O modules are no longer manu-factured. PET Technical Consulting is developing a control system replacement for the RDS- 111 cyclotron with expected completion in 2014...|$|R
5000|$|An audio {{multicore}} {{may also}} {{function as a}} <b>breakout</b> <b>cable,</b> {{if it has a}} compound connector on one end and component connectors on the other. This is more common in short multicores meant for in-studio connections, such as audio engines, analog to digital converters or digital mixing consoles. [...] Multicore cables may also connect to either the front or back of patch panels, when the patch panel is used as an access point or breakout box for connecting external inputs and outputs.|$|E
5000|$|VIVO {{is found}} on {{high-end}} ATI and NVIDIA computer video cards, sometimes labeled [...] "TV OUT". VIVO on these graphics cards typically supports composite, component, and S-Video as outputs, and composite and S-Video as inputs. Many other video cards only support component and/or S-Video outputs to complement VGA or DVI, typically using a component <b>breakout</b> <b>cable</b> and an S-Video cable. While component-out operation supports high-definition resolutions, {{it does not}} support the HDCP standard which would be required for official HDTV support as set out by the EICTA.|$|E
50|$|Because each fiber is {{individually}} reinforced, {{the cable}} {{can be easily}} divided into individual fiber lines. Each simplex cable within the outer jacket may be broken out and then continue as a patch cable, for example in a fiber to the desk application in an office building. This enables connector termination without requiring special junctions, and can reduce or {{eliminate the need for}} fiberoptic patch panels or an optical distribution frame. <b>Breakout</b> <b>cable</b> requires terminations to be done with simple connectors, which may be preferred for some situations. A more common solution today is the use of a fanout kit that adds a jacket to the very fine strands of other cable types.|$|E
