The current integrated WASP solution demonstrated in herd health control test bed can be well {{used as a}} research tool for animal and human behaviour scientists to enable data acquisition for periods up to several weeks to study behaviour and, in the end, come up with better models and treatments. Within the WASP test bed for Smart Dairy Farming, the {{focus has been on}} remote monitoring of activity-related problems like claw health and locomotion. Encouraged by the large-scale herd control deployment whose operation is limited to 10 to 12 days, we performed an exercise to assess whether it seems feasible to monitor a large number of cows over a period of a year without replacing the 8 Ah batteries. Through this exercise, we wanted to get a feeling on application and deployment trade-offs like 1) acceptable time between packets generated at application level, 2) acceptable number of battery-powered mobile sensor nodes, 3) required number and positioning of battery- and/or mains-powered forwarder nodes and 4) required number and positioning of sink nodes, while considering application Quality of Service constraints in terms of size (and hence energy capacity) of <b>batteries,</b> <b>packet</b> delivery ratio and packet delivery latency.

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) {{are subject}} to several kind of threats and attacks, like eavesdropping, intrusion, <b>battery</b> exhausting, <b>packets</b> reply and nodes compromising. While most of threats {{can be dealt with}} them through {{cryptographic}} materials provided by key management protocols, some other threats, like nodes replication attacks, can still go undetectable. Nodes replication attacks {{are one of the most}} redoubtable attacks, where an attacker compromising a node, uses its secret cryptographic key materials to successfully populate the network with clones of it. Few nodes replication defending protocols were proposed in the literature, but unfortunately, they require either a high computation, transmission and energy overheads, or that nodes know their exact location coordinates, which limits their usability in most WSN scenarios. In this paper, we present a replication detection protocol for static WSN, which requires no knowledge of nodes deployment locations, and introduces no significant overhead on the resource-constrained sensors...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} integer maximum flow problem on {{wireless}} sensor networks with energy constraint. In this problem, sensor nodes gather data and then relay them to a base station, before they run out of <b>battery</b> power. <b>Packets</b> are considered as integral units and not splittable. The problem {{is to find the}} maximum data flow in the sensor network subject to the energy constraint of the sensors. We show that this integral version of the problem is strongly NP-complete and in fact APX-hard. It follows that the problem is unlikely to have a polynomial time approximation scheme. Even when restricted to graphs with concrete geometrically defined connectivity and transmission costs, the problem is still strongly NP-complete. We provide some interesting polynomial time algorithms that give good approximations for the general case nonetheless. For networks with bounded treewidth greater than two, we show that the problem is weakly NP-complete and provide pseudo-polynomial time algorithms. For a special case of graphs with treewidth two, we give a polynomial time algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to limited}} {{functionalities}} and potentially {{large number of}} sensors, existing routing strategies proposed for mobile ad hoc networks are not directly applicable to wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we present a meshed multipath routing (M-MPR) protocol with selective forwarding (SF) of packets and end-to-end forward error correction (FEC) coding. We also describe a meshed multipath searching scheme suitable for sensor networks, which has a reduced signaling overhead and nodal database. Our performance evaluations show that (1) M-MPR achieves a much improved throughput over conventional disjoint multipath routing with comparable power consumption and receiver complexity; (2) to successfully route a message using FEC coding, selective forwarding (SF) consumes much less network resources, such as channel bandwidth and <b>battery</b> power, than <b>packet</b> replication (or limited flooding) ...|$|R

40|$|This letter {{investigates the}} {{structure}} of the optimal policy for a class of Markov decision processes (MDPs), having convex and piecewise linear cost function. The optimal policy is proved to have a piecewise linear structure that alternates flat and constant-slope pieces, resembling a staircase with tilted rises and as many steps (thresholds) as the breakpoints of the cost function. This particular structure makes it possible to express the policy in a very compact manner, particularly suitable to be stored in low-end devices. More importantly, the threshold-based form of the optimal policy can be exploited to reduce the computational complexity of the iterative dynamic programming (DP) algorithm used to solve the problem. These results apply to a rather wide set of optimization problems, typically involving the management of a resource buffer such as the energy stored in a <b>battery,</b> or the <b>packets</b> queued in a wireless node...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Security {{threat and}} routing holes in {{wireless}} scenario are more frequent than other networks. Lack of infrastructure and centralized monitoring using limited battery power are the crucial point. Attackers can easily launch an attack to consumed resources of wireless network such as <b>battery</b> power <b>packet</b> dropping attack in sensor network. In such exploiting condition an antagonist node may launch various attacks {{to disturb the}} communication in WSN. Amidst of such attacks packet dropping and modifier are the most prevailing attacks. In packet dropping attack compromising nods starts dropping each and every packet pass from him (node) or modify the packet before forwarding in a later attack. In wireless sensor network, {{there are so many}} challenges and issues as already been discussed and proposed. The main challenges are how to provide maximum lifetime to network and how to provide robustness to network. In sensor network, the energy is mainly consumed for three purposes: data transmission, signal processing, and hardware operation. In this article we have Propose a machine learning based mechanism to identify the routing holes on wireless sensor network. The concept lies on social behavior of the human society in which individual’s behavior is the benchmark to decide his authenticity in the network. Proposed system works on the concept of the anomaly detection due to unlabeled information produce by the sensor nodes. The overall objective of this research article is to identify packet dropper and modifier in wireless sensor network against the set of qualitative performance metrics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Over {{the last}} few years, mobile {{wireless}} LANs (m-WLANs), which are characterized by portable access points (APs) and {{a small number of}} connected clients, are becoming popular. When a large number of such personal mobile APs operate close to each other, for example in crowded urban areas and conference venues, the quality of service (QoS) of the connected clients can be severely degraded due to co-channel and adjacent-channel interference. While there exists a large pool of literature on interference management techniques for fixed WLANs, the small form-factor mobile APs present new challenges in terms of high-density deployments and mobility-induced dynamic interference relations. The importance of minimizing interference in m-WLANs is additionally motivated from an energy-efficiency point of view. Since mobile APs rely on limited <b>battery</b> power, <b>packet</b> collisions and retransmissions have a direct impact on the on-time of the APs. In this paper, we present results from a detailed measurement study based on commercially-available m-WLAN devices – two brands of mobile APs and smartphone based clients. While the QoS characteristics of m-WLANs operating on the same channel have been investigated in prior work, we believe this is the first study of adjacent-channel interference using real-world mobile APs. Our experiments reveal the relationship between the distance between m-WLANs and the total throughput of each m-WLAN in various combinations of channels used. Further, we outline how the results can be used for designing optimal channel allocations in dense m-WLAN settings. Keywords-Wireless LAN, mobile access point, interference I...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the reliable broadcast and multicast lifetime maximization problems in energy-constrained wireless ad hoc networks, such as wireless sensor networks for environment monitoring and wireless ad hoc networks consisting of laptops or PDAs with limited <b>battery</b> capacities. In <b>packet</b> loss-free networks, the optimal solution of life-time maximization problem can be easily obtained by tree-based algorithms. In unreliable networks, we formulate them as min–max tree problems and prove them NP-complete by a reduction from a well-known minimum degree spanning tree problem. A link quality-aware heuristic algorithm called Maximum Lifetime Reliable Broadcast Tree (MLRBT) is pro-posed to build a broadcast tree that maximizes the network lifetime. The reliable multicast lifetime maximization problem can be solved as well by pruning the broadcast tree produced by the MLRBT algorithm. The time complexity analysis of both algorithms is also provided.

40|$|Abstract—Position based routing {{protocols}} {{are the kinds}} of {{routing protocols}}, which they use of nodes location information, instead of links information to routing. In position based routing protocols, it supposed that the packet source node has position information of itself and it's neighbors and packet destination node. Greedy is a very important position based routing protocol. In one of it's kinds, named MFR (Most Forward Within Radius), source node or packet forwarder node, sends packet to one of it's neighbors with most forward progress towards destination node (closest neighbor to destination). Using distance deciding metric in Greedy to forward packet to a neighbor node, is not suitable for all conditions. If closest neighbor to destination node, has high speed, in comparison with source node or intermediate packet forwarder node speed or has very low remained <b>battery</b> power, then <b>packet</b> loss probability is increased. Proposed strategy uses combination of metrics distancevelocity similarity-power, to deciding about giving the packet to which neighbor. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy has lower lost packets average than Greedy, so it has more reliability...|$|R
40|$|Quorum-based Power Saving (QPS) {{protocols}} {{have been}} proposed for ad hoc networks (e. g., IEEE 802. 11 ad hoc mode) to increase energy efficiency and prolong the op-erational time of mobile stations. These protocols assign to each station a cycle pattern that specifies when the sta-tion should wake up (to transmit/receive data) and sleep (to save battery power). In all existing QPS protocols, the cy-cle length is either identical for all stations or is restricted to certain numbers (e. g. squares or primes). These restric-tions on cycle length severely limit the practical use of QPS protocols as each individual station may want to select a cycle length that is best suited for its own need (in terms of remaining <b>battery</b> power, tolerable <b>packet</b> delay, and drop ratio).

The proposed energy system can take energy flow instructions from a SEDC. In the present analysis a small wind energy system with battery storage has been simulated in Matlab/Simulink. The system has been modelled using low order transfer functions. Random switching has been done to get energy packets from the model. A prototype of the battery based energy storage system has been designed and implemented.
