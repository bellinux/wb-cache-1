40|$|Steel-concrete {{composite}} shell roofs (Comshell roofs) {{are formed}} by pouring concrete on a thin stiffened steel base shell {{which serves as}} both the permanent formwork and the tensile steel reinforcement. The thin steel base <b>shell,</b> constructed by <b>bolting</b> together open-topped modular units consisting of a base plate and surrounding edge plates, are required to carry the wet concrete loading safely during construction. The behaviour of these <b>bolted</b> <b>shells</b> {{is complicated by the}} presence of many bolted joints, so the use of finite element analysis is necessary in order to accurately predict their behaviour. For any such finite element model, the key issue is the accurate modelling of the behaviour of the bolted connections within a <b>bolted</b> steel base <b>shell</b> in which bending and membrane actions exist in both directions. In this paper, bolted flat panel specimens under transverse loading are studied to develop a good understanding of the behaviour of such bolted connections and to assess the validity of a relatively simple finite element connection model developed in a previous study. Experimental results obtained from a series of flexural tests on model bolted panels are presented together with those from finite element analyses in which the existing simplified connection model was employed. Comparisons of results from these two approaches confirm that the simplified connection model proposed in a previous study leads to accurate predictions of the flexural behaviour of these present bolted panels.

50|$|Point anchor <b>bolts</b> (or {{expansion}} <b>shell</b> <b>bolts)</b> are {{a common}} style of area ground support. A point anchor bolt is a metal bar between 20 mm - 25 mm in diameter, and between 1 m - 4 m long (the size {{is determined by the}} mine's engineering department). There is an expansion shell {{at the end of the}} bolt which is inserted into the hole. As the bolt is tightened by the installation drill the expansion shell expands and the bolt tightens holding the rock together. Mechanical bolts are considered temporary support as their lifespan is reduced by corrosion as they are not grouted.|$|R

40|$|<b>Bolted,</b> {{segmented}} cylindrical <b>shells</b> are {{a common}} structural component in many engineering systems especially for aerospace launch vehicles. Segmented shells are often needed due to limitations of manufacturing capabilities or transportation issues related to very long, large-diameter cylindrical shells. These cylindrical shells typically have a flange or ring welded to opposite ends so that shell segments can be mated together and bolted to form a larger structural system. As the diameter of these shells increases, maintaining strict fabrication tolerances for the flanges to be flat and parallel on a welded structure is an extreme challenge. Local fit-up stresses develop in the structure due to flange mating-surface mismatch (flange waviness). These local stresses {{need to be considered}} when predicting a critical initial flaw size. Flange waviness is one contributor to the fit-up stress state. The present paper describes the modeling and analysis effort to simulate fit-up stresses due to flange waviness in a typical <b>bolted,</b> segmented cylindrical <b>shell.</b> Results from parametric studies are presented for various flange mating-surface waviness distributions and amplitudes I...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBurst of a reactor {{occurred}} {{in an explosion}} accident during the production of antistatic agent process. According {{to the results of}} site survey, the current regulations and standards as well as the requirements of the accident investigation group, the reason of burst was discussed by failure analysis of the <b>shell</b> and <b>bolts.</b> The <b>shell</b> strength was analyzed by visual inspection, thickness measurement, and strength verification as well as estimating of bursting pressure. It can be concluded that the tank strength met the requirements of design condition. The bolts of the reactor was broken in the accident, so the failure analysis of bolts was carried out in detail, including visual inspection, fracture examination, chemical composition analysis, mechanical testing and strength verification. According to the results of the measured mechanical properties, the strength of the bolts was verified. It can be concluded that the bolts could bear the proof pressure test safely. Fracture analysis shows that no obvious metallurgical defects were found, the bolts were broken due to extreme overload. According to the technical analysis of the <b>shell</b> and the <b>bolts,</b> it can be concluded that the reactor could service safely under normal operating conditions. The cause of the bursting was transient extreme overpressure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new structural system, namely steel-concrete composite shells, for enclosing large spaces and presents test and numerical simulation results {{to demonstrate its}} feasibility. These composite shells are formed by pouring concrete on a thin stiffened steel base shell which serves as both the permanent formwork and the tensile steel reinforcement. The thin steel <b>shell,</b> constructed by <b>bolting</b> together open-topped modular units consisting of a base plate with surrounding edge plates, is a steel shell with thin stiffeners in both directions. The new system retains all the benefits of thin concrete shells, but {{eliminates the need for}} temporary formwork and minimises the required falsework. In this paper, the background to the development of this new structural system is first given, followed by a description of its structural features. Advantages of this new structural system over existing systems are next discussed. Possible failure modes of the new structural system are also outlined. Finally, a study to demonstrate the feasibility of constructing these shell roofs of large spans with very thin steel sheets and a limited amount of shoring is presented. In this feasibility study, a finite element model was developed for bolted steel arches as a conservative approximation of <b>bolted</b> steel <b>shells,</b> and was verified using results from simple connection tests. Both the connection tests and the verification of the finite element model are given in this paper before presenting the results from the parametric study.

The technique feature is a kind of specially three-dimensional bar-mat reinforcement instead of three-dimensional bar-mat. It has very high mechanical property and was applied in difficult drift without profiled bar, anchor bolt, grouting and so on. The model experiment was done by relying on the industrial test on the broken laneway of Xishan Coal Power Company. The distortion, destruct shape, developmental rule of the supporting system were examined while the stress and strain distributing rule and also the ultimate load were obtained. The application showed that without reducing the carrying capacity of supporting the case, and heavy metal stent compared to the steel supporting the form of reduced consumption and the amount of concrete rebound, and has good flexibility, is all excellent soft rock drift Jean pressure retaining structure, and has good prospects for widespread application...|$|R

These picosatellites weigh about one kg and can be developed and built by students.

NPSCuL will carry up to ten P-PODs built and flight qualified by CalPoly. It will be launched into orbit and deploy multiple CubeSats. Several designs have been developed including finite element models each with a variable number of elements and shell wall thicknesses and tested to loads of 15 g. The simulation results show that the aluminum structures need to have a minimum shell thickness of 15 mm to handle the maximum expected stress. Different bolt patterns for the connection between the structure and the base plate were analyzed. A circular bolt pattern is preferred because the stress is distributed more evenly over the <b>bolts</b> but the <b>shell</b> thickness was modified based on the results from the frequency analysis...|$|R

Leutnant Köstlin had {{received}} the order in the afternoon of 9 July and took the company back to Martinpuich for supplies and ammunition but the field kitchen draught horse <b>bolted</b> from a <b>shell</b> with the field kitchen. Ammunition took until after midnight to issue and then the company moved forward, with two machine-guns. Two guides had been sent back from the III Battalion {{but it was so}} dark that Köstlin went cross-country on a compass bearing. The column lost cohesion in the dark between Martinpuich and Bazentin {{because of the number of}} shell-holes and trenches to traverse and the halts to form up took too much time. Köstlin formed the company into columns of sections after passing over the second position and the advance quickened. The ground was under shellfire and casualties began to increase. Köstlin decided to avoid Mametz Wood and move in the open between the wood and Comtalmaison on the line of the Grossherzogsgraben (Pearl Alley) to Quadrangle Trench and then to the wood from Quadrangle Support. As they crossed the Contalmaison–Bazentin road at [...] as dawn was breaking, Köstlin sent the guides forward who took twenty minutes to get back and report that the trench was straight ahead. As the company advanced, a machine-gun opened fire from the right and caused much confusion. Köstlin shouted [...] "Double march, into the trench in front" [...] but it was another [...] further on and only thirty men followed him, the rest retreating in confusion to the second position or taking cover.|$|R
