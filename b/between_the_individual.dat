Some, including the major castles, including the castles of the Downs in Kent, were intended to be self-contained and able to defend themselves against attack from the land, while the smaller blockhouses were primarily focused on the maritime threat.

The discussion covers the subjects of Tattvas, the nature and relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> soul (Self, Atman) and the Ultimate Reality (Brahman), the seven stages of learning, the characteristics of Jivanmukti (inner sense of freedom while living), and the four types of Jivanmuktas (liberated persons).

5|$|TiCl4 is a dense, {{colourless}} distillable liquid, although crude samples may be {{yellow or}} even red-brown. It {{is one of}} the rare transition metal halides that is a liquid at room temperature, VCl4 being another example. This property reflects the fact that TiCl4 is molecular; that is, each TiCl4 molecule is relatively weakly associated with its neighbours. Most metal chlorides are polymers, wherein the chloride atoms bridge between the metals. The attraction <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> TiCl4 molecules is weak, primarily van der Waals forces, and these weak interactions result in low melting and boiling points, similar to those of CCl4.|$|E

Cochrane argues that those beings who lack personhood, including many nonhuman animals and some humans, do not have an interest in liberty or not being used by others, and so have no prima facie right to freedom. They do, however, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed.|$|E

40|$|Two new {{normative}} {{indices of}} mobility are proposed.

This index is also higher, the greater <b>the</b> rank gap <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>between</b> whom a swap takes place. The second index is an income weighted generalized Gini mobility index. When a transfer takes place between two individuals this index will be higher, the greater the transfer.

40|$|The {{effective}} application of knowledge management in organizations {{is an essential}} factor in their successful operation. Furthermore, {{it is more important}} that how people exploit tacit knowledge, how they make tacit knowledge beneficial to the organization. Sharing tacit knowledge within an organization is critical to the organization among <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> and <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals.</b> However, there is no approach based on multi-agent systems to analyze the sharing of tacit knowledge, and to discover what kinds of methods tacit knowledge can be shared and how organizations make themselves effective and efficient based on multi-agent systems. So this paper, based on multi-agent systems, aims to present for discussion the mechanism of sharing tacit knowledge within an organization. First of all, this paper describes three main characteristics of tacit knowledge; then expands to find <b>the</b> games <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> in <b>the</b> organization.

25|$|Some {{cephalopods}} {{are able}} to fly through the air for distances of up to 50m. While cephalopods are not particularly aerodynamic, they achieve these impressive ranges by jet-propulsion; water continues to be expelled from the funnel while the organism is in the air.

25|$|It is {{interesting}} that {{the distinction between the}} first two rules and the latter rule can also be found in early treatises on music, introducing the terms metrum and rhythmus. As it could also be demonstrated by Van Kampen that melodic peaks often coincide with the word accent (see also), the conclusion seems warranted that the Gregorian melodies enhance the expressiveness of the Latin words by mimicking to some extent both the accentuation of the sacred words (pitch differences between neumes) and the relative duration of the word syllables (by paying attention to well-defined length differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> notes of a neume).|$|E
25|$|The {{exploration}} of this theme in Oedipus Rex is paralleled by {{the examination of}} the conflict <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> and the state in Antigone.

When informed by the blind prophet Tiresias that religious forces are against him, each king claims that the priest has been corrupted. It is here, however, that their similarities come to an end: while Creon, seeing the havoc he has wreaked, tries to amend his mistakes, Oedipus refuses to listen to anyone.|$|E
40|$|The {{understanding}} of the macroscopic phenomenological models of the population growth at a microscopic level is important to predict the population behaviors emerged from <b>the</b> interactions <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals.</b> In this work we consider {{the influence of the}} cell-cell interaction on the population growth rate $R$ in a tumor system, and show that, in most cases especially small proliferative probabilities, the regulative role of the interaction will be strengthened with the decline of the intrinsic proliferative probabilities. For the high replication rates of an <b>individual</b> and <b>the</b> cooperative interactions, the proliferative probability almost has no effect.
