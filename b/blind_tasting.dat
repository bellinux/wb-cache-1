25|$|To ensure {{impartial}} {{judgment of}} a wine, {{it should be}} served blind – that is, without the taster(s) having seen the label or bottle shape. <b>Blind</b> <b>tasting</b> may also involve serving the wine from a black wine glass to mask {{the color of the}} wine. A taster's judgment can be prejudiced by knowing details of a wine, such as geographic origin, price, reputation, color, or other considerations.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} Malbec in Argentina led some {{producers}} in neighboring Chile {{to try their}} hand at the varietal. Grown throughout the Central Valley, Chilean Malbec {{tends to be more}} tannic than its Argentine counterpart and is used primarily in Bordeaux-style blends. In 2016 a budget-priced La Moneda Reserve Malbec from the UK supermarket chain Asda won the Platinum Best in Show prize in a <b>blind</b> <b>tasting</b> at the Decanter World Wine awards.|$|E

In 2011, L'Acadie Vineyards won a silver medal at an international competition for sparkling wines in France and in 2012, Benjamin Bridge winery's 2004 Brut Reserve placed higher than a Louis Roederer 2004 Cristal (wine) champagne at a <b>blind</b> <b>tasting</b> held with noted critics, bringing attention to the country's wine industry. In Ontario, wineries recognized for their sparkling wines include Henry of Pelham Winery, Jackson-Triggs and Inniskillin.|$|E

25|$|Sancerre {{is often}} {{compared}} to neighboring Pouilly-Fumé which also specializes in 100% Sauvignon blanc wines, {{and while there}} are some differences, wine experts like Robinson, Johnson and Karen MacNeil note that only very experienced tasters can distinguish the differences in a <b>blind</b> <b>tasting.</b> Broadly speaking, Sancerre tends to have a fuller body with more pronounced aromas, while Pouilly-Fumé wines are more perfumed. However, both wines have naturally high acidity and the potential to exhibit the minerally, flinty notes described as pierre à fusil or gunflint, as well as citrus and spicy notes.|$|E
25|$|Tasting {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the sensory analysis (also referred to as organoleptic analysis) of wine. Employing a trained or consumer panel, oenologists may perform a variety of tests on the taste, aroma, mouthfeel and appeal of wines. Difference tests are important in determining whether different fermentation conditions or new vineyard treatments alter the character of a wine, something particularly important to producers who aim for consistency. Preference testing establishes consumer preference, while descriptive analysis determines the most prominent traits of the wine, some of which grace back labels. <b>Blind</b> <b>tasting</b> and other laboratory controls help mitigate bias and assure statistically significant results. Many large wine companies now boast their own sensory team, optimally consisting of a Ph.D. sensory scientist, a flavor chemist and a trained panel.|$|E
500|$|In California, Cabernet Sauvignon has {{developed}} its characteristic style and reputation, recognizable in the world's market. Production and plantings of the grape in California {{are similar in}} quantity to those of Bordeaux. The 1976 Judgment of Paris wine tasting event helped to catapult Californian Cabernet Sauvignons onto the international stage when Stag's Leap Wine Cellars' 1973 Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon beat out classified Bordeaux estates like Château Mouton Rothschild, Château Montrose, Château Haut-Brion and Château Léoville-Las Cases in a <b>blind</b> <b>tasting</b> conducted by French wine experts. In the 1980s, a new epidemic of phylloxera hit California, devastating many vineyards, which needed replanting. There was some speculation that ravaged Cabernet vineyards would be replanted with other varietals (such as those emerging from the Rhone Rangers movement) but in fact California plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon [...] doubled between 1988 and 1998; many wine regions— such as Napa Valley north of Yountville and Sonoma's Alexander Valley— were almost completely dominated by the grape variety. It also started to gain a foothold in Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma Mountain and Mendocino County. Cabernet from Sonoma County has shown a tendency to feature anise and black olive notes while Napa County Cabernets are characterized by their strong black fruit flavors.|$|E

The Chardonay from Le Clos Jordanne placed first out of the 14 white wines, some of which were notable international wines, including: Chateau Montelena, Mer Soleil, Kumeu River, an aged reserve wine from Rosemount Estates, and a number of Burgundian entrants from producers such as Drouhin, Lamy, Boisset, Maison Louis Jadot, and others.

2500|$|Due to the [...] "malleability" [...] of Chardonnay in {{winemaking}} and {{its ability}} to reflect its terroir, there is not one distinct universal [...] "style" [...] or set of constants that could be applied to Chardonnay made across the globe. According to Jancis Robinson, a sense of [...] "smokiness" [...] is one clue that could be picked up in a <b>blind</b> <b>tasting</b> of Chardonnay but there are many styles that do not have any [...] "smokey" [...] notes. Compared to other white wine grapes like Sauvignon blanc, Gewürztraminer and Viognier-Chardonnay has a more subtle and muted nose with no overwhelming aromatics that jump out of the wine glass. The identifying styles of Chardonnay are regionally based. For example, pineapple notes are more commonly associated with Chardonnay from Napa Valley while Chablis will have more notes of green apples. While many examples of Chardonnay can benefit from a few years of bottle aging, especially if they have high acidity, most Chardonnays are meant to be consumed in their youth. A notable exception to this is the most premium examples of Chablis and white Burgundies.|$|E
2500|$|It {{took time}} for the Californian wine {{industry}} to recover from this setback. By the 1960s, California was primarily known for its sweet port-style wines made from Carignan and Thompson Seedless grapes. However {{a new wave of}} winemakers soon emerged and helped usher in a renaissance period in California wine with a focus on new winemaking technologies and emphasizing quality. Several well-known wineries were founded in this decade including Robert Mondavi, Heitz Wine Cellars and David Bruce Winery. As the quality of Californian wine improved, the region started to receive more international attention. A [...] moment for the industry occurred in 1976 when British wine merchant Steven Spurrier invited several Californian wineries to participate in a <b>blind</b> <b>tasting</b> event in Paris. It was to compare the best of California with the best of Bordeaux and Burgundy - two famous French wine regions. In an event known as The Judgment of Paris, Californian wines shocked the world by sweeping the wine competition in both the red and white wine categories. Throughout the wine world, perspectives about the potential of California wines started to change.
