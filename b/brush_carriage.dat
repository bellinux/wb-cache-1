Despite {{a fire in}} 1875 which destroyed much {{of the center of}} town, Farmington was known as [...] "The Shoe Capital of New Hampshire." [...] Other factories produced knives, knit underwear, wooden boxes, wooden handles and <b>carriages.</b> <b>Brushes</b> were manufactured by the F. W. Browne Company, from which Booker T. Washington ordered twelve street brooms in 1915 for use at the Tuskegee Institute. The town had five blacksmith shops. But the Panic of 1893 closed all but two large shoe factories. The industry faded in the 20th century, when most of the factories were demolished.|$|R
