5|$|A Soviet {{submarine}} is sailing {{near the}} North Pole in 1983 during the Cold War. A nuclear weapons launch drill {{they are running}} is interrupted by Professor Grisenko (David Warner). In the submarine's cargo hold a sailor prematurely begins to defrost a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> that Grisenko believes contains a frozen mammoth, and is attacked by what is inside.|$|E
5|$|Melody {{manages to}} grab the trident and returns it to King Triton, who then punishes Morgana by sending her {{to the bottom of}} the ocean frozen in a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice.</b> Triton returns Ariel to human form, the wall {{separating}} Eric's castle from the sea is torn down, and contact between humans and merfolk is restored.|$|E
5|$|After {{approximately}} three weeks, the expedition arrived in Lambaréné {{and met with}} Albert Schweitzer. Klevan later described the meeting with Schweitzer as the greatest moment of the entire expedition. Later, the hospital received 500kg of Norwegian klippfisk (dried and salted cod), a particular favourite with the hospital's patients. The medicines were handed over, and the container was opened. Even though the drainage had been monitored throughout the expedition, there was still great excitement associated with seeing the result firsthand. The <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> {{turned out to be}} almost entirely intact.|$|E
50|$|At Torre del Reloj, {{teams had}} to load three <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> into a wooden cart and then {{transport}} it to Plaza Fernández de Madrid. Once there, they would exchange the <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> {{for their next}} clue.|$|R

5000|$|For {{areas on}} land, as the Puget Lobe receded, <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> broke off and became separate. The melting glacier {{produced}} streams which carried sediment. The bottom <b>of</b> the <b>ice</b> <b>blocks</b> became buried in sediment. As the <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> melted, it left depressions {{in the ground}} called kettles. Some of these kettles filled up with water to become kettle lakes and kettle ponds. (see Kettle (landform)) ...|$|R

Katara then uses her waterbending to revive and heal Zuko. As {{a result of her}} defeat by two people she considers less than worthless, Azula's mind finally snaps and she screams and sobs in fury, yet unable to escape from her chains. Meanwhile, the Order of the White Lotus successfully liberates Ba Sing Se {{in the name of the}} Earth King.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns reveals to Smithers that {{he misses}} his {{cherished}} bear Bobo and desperately wants it back {{but has no}} idea where it is. Another flashback reveals Bobo's history: after Mr. Burns leaves it behind, the bear eventually finds its way to Charles Lindbergh, who tosses the bear into a crowd, where it is caught by Adolf Hitler. In 1945, Hitler blames Bobo for losing World War II and tosses him away. Bobo is seen again in 1957 on board the USS Nautilus headed for the North Pole. Bobo becomes encased in a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> until picked up by an ice-gathering expedition in 1993. The bag of ice with Bobo in it {{is sent to the}} Kwik-E-Mart in Springfield. Bart buys the bag of ice, finds Bobo inside and gives it to Maggie to play with.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{expedition}} {{was given to}} Sivert Klevan, an engineer with a good instinct for public relations. The ice was to be procured from the glacier Svartisen, and a glaciologist was brought along to give advice. It {{soon became clear that}} the entire three-ton block could not be brought out in one go. Instead, 200kg blocks were cut out with a chainsaw, carried away on a sled, and flown by helicopter down to the town centre. There they were melted together to make a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> weighing 3,050kg. The block was placed in a specially constructed iron container, which was insulated with wood and glass wool. The container was placed on top of a truck that would carry {{it all the way to}} the Equator, accompanied by a van carrying equipment and a sedan with a film crew.|$|E

5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> out of the tub in which our drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came over the side of the gutter, crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass. Those English eyes certainly did stand out.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived at}} its final destination of Libreville on 21 March, after twenty-seven days. The <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> {{was found to}} weigh 2,714kg; it had lost only 336kg along the way. Though it was unclear how much time the expedition would take, Klevan had initially estimated a loss of 10%; the end result was approximately 11%. A French representative of the company met the crew in Libreville. A personal friend of President Charles de Gaulle, he presented an offer to drive the ice back to Paris. If the crew accepted, the President himself would have received the crew under the Arc de Triomphe. The men, however, were too exhausted at that point to contemplate such an offer. Instead, arrangement were made for the vehicles to be brought back by freight, while the crew would fly home. The ice was cut up and divided between the citizens of Libreville, for whom this was a rare commodity. Klevan, always conscious of promotional opportunities, brought {{a portion of the}} ice back home with him. This ice was subsequently used in drinks served to journalists at the première of the expedition documentary back home in Oslo.|$|E

25|$|Consequently, port {{authorities}} built a steel dock in 1972, which waves from a storm destroyed soon after. Builders {{came up with}} an alternative that same season. They constructed a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice,</b> covered it with matting and straw and used it as a fender for a tanker that docked at the harbor in fall 1973. The ice fender became the forerunner to the contemporary ice pier.|$|E
25|$|The Native Americans {{used two}} kinds of knife traps. One method was to encase a sharp blade in fat and frozen upright on a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice.</b> The wolf would cut itself while licking the blade and bleed to death. Some argue that this method is a myth. The other method was a baited torsion spring which when triggered, would stab the wolf in the head.|$|E

Their effort fails, and the execution device is activated.|$|E
25|$|Years later, the superhero {{team the}} Avengers discovers Steve Rogers' {{body in the}} North Atlantic. After he revives, they piece {{together}} that Rogers has been preserved in a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> since 1945, surviving because of his enhancements from Project: Rebirth. The block began to melt after the Sub-Mariner, enraged that an Inuit tribe is worshipping the frozen figure, throws it into the ocean. Rogers accepts membership in the Avengers, and his experience in individual combat service and his time with the Invaders makes him a valuable asset. He quickly assumes leadership and has typically returned to that position throughout the team's history.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} famous finds at Pazyryk is the Pazyryk carpet, which is {{probably}} the oldest surviving pile carpet in the world. It measures 183×200cm and has a knot density of approximately 360,000 knots per square meter, which is higher than most modern carpets. The middle of the carpet consists of a ribbon motif, while in the border there is a procession with elk or deer, and in another border warriors on horses. The Pazyryk carpet was probably manufactured in Armenia or Persia around 400 BC. When it was found it had been deeply frozen in a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice,</b> which is why it is so well-preserved. The carpet can be seen at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia.|$|E

25|$|On July 9, 2008, Rick Dyer and Matthew Whitton {{posted a}} video to YouTube, {{claiming}} that they had discovered {{the body of a}} dead Sasquatch in a forest in northern Georgia. Tom Biscardi was contacted to investigate. Dyer and Whitton received $50,000 from Searching for Bigfoot, Inc. as a good faith gesture. The story was covered by many major news networks, including BBC, CNN, ABC News, and Fox News. Soon after a press conference, the alleged Bigfoot body was delivered in a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> in a freezer with the Searching for Bigfoot team. When the contents were thawed, observers found that the hair was not real, the head was hollow, and the feet were rubber. Dyer and Whitton admitted that it was a hoax after being confronted by Steve Kulls, executive director of SquatchDetective.com.|$|E
25|$|The wine is {{fermented}} once on {{the barrel}} and then undergoes a second fermentation in the bottle after the addition of yeast, nutrients for the yeast, and sugar (known as tirage). The second fermentation results in a natural sparkling wine. Yeast precipitate (lees) must then be removed. This begins with riddling (remuage in French) {{which means that the}} bottles are turned with the neck downwards and lightly shaken to move the lees to the neck of the bottle. This is done in small steps where the bottle orientation gradually changes. Finally the inverted bottle necks are cooled so that the precipitation freezes to a small <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice,</b> the bottles are turned upright and the temporary closure (normally a crown cap) is opened so that the precipitate is pushed out by the pressure in the bottle. Then the bottle is filled to replace the missing volume, and fitted with a plain Champagne cork and halter. The process to remove lees is called disgorging.|$|E
500|$|The {{ice block}} {{expedition}} of 1959 (...) was {{a publicity stunt}} {{carried out by the}} Norwegian insulation material producer Glassvatt (today called Glava AS). Responding to a challenge from the radio station Radio Luxembourg, Glassvatt decided to equip a truck to bring a three-ton <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> from Mo i Rana by the Arctic Circle, to Libreville by the Equator. There was no form of refrigeration applied, and the expedition was intended to display the efficiency of the insulating glass wool used. The truck also brought 300kg of medicines to the hospital of Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné.|$|E
