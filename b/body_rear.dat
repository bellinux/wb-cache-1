5000|$|An {{up close}} {{examination}} of the Chaparral 2F (Mercury [...] "articolo" [...] # 30), produced about 1970, {{is a good example}} of the company's ingenuity. The rear wing (which along with its struts was diecast metal) moved up and down and also tilted. The gull-wing doors were molded in clear plastic with lower portions painted white like the <b>body.</b> <b>Rear</b> mesh covering the engine and lined vents added realism. Sometimes Mercury models went above and beyond the norm. On the Chaparral, this was seen in minutae lilke tiny dual diecast metal gas caps which opened. Decals were fairly precise and historically accurate including sponsorship by Shell and toy model manufacturer Cox - labeled on the sides. The steering wheel was a couple of sizes too big, but other features made up for that. The front headlight were cast not in clear plastic, but in a yellowish tint. The exhaust tips exited the rear molded into a separate metal plate - the tips were also machined to look hollow. Also, Chaparral creator Jim Hall was from Texas and the Mercury version has yellow Texas plates.Having stated many positives, this model, produced about 1970, was not perfect in proportion. The rear quarters look a bit too thick and square and the gentle curve of the doors up to the engine lid vents is lost on this model. Also, those vents on the real car are molded to look like two separate intakes while it is a single intake on each side of the model. The front grill on the Mercury is just an elongated rectangle while the real car's was oval-ish.|$|E
5000|$|The Ashanti armies {{served the}} empire well, {{supporting}} its {{long period of}} expansion and subsequent resistance to European colonization. Armament was primarily with firearms, but some historians hold that indigenous organization and leadership probably played a more crucial role in Ashanti successes.

The political genius of the symbolic [...] "golden stool" [...] and the fusing effect of a national army however, provided the unity {{needed to keep the}} empire viable.

5000|$|Third {{generation}} {{models were}} sold as the Plymouth Voyager, Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country. The Caravan and Voyager {{were available in}} either 3 or 4 door configurations on either a standard model or an extended wheelbase model known as the Grand Voyager and Grand Caravan, respectively. The Town & Country was only available in a long wheelbase configuration, with either 3 or 4 doors. Caravan trim levels were largely carried over from the previous generation, offered in Base, SE, and {{top of the line}} ES models, while a Sport package was available on short wheelbase SE models. Caravan ES models came with more options than before, featuring a standard Infinity sound system, a power driver's seat, dual-zone climate control, deluxe cloth seating (leather was optional) and alloy wheels, among other features. As part of Chrysler's new corporate strategy to better focus the Plymouth brand on entry-level vehicles, Voyagers and were only available in base trim and better-equipped SE models, although a high end LE trim which was largely a clone of the Caravan ES was available in Canada. A Rallye option package continued to be available on SE model, being the de facto top of the line Voyager. It was renamed [...] "Expresso" [...] for 1998. The Town & Country was now available in two different trims, the LX and LXi. On the Voyager and Caravan, the trims were easily distinguished by their body-side moldings. Base models used a narrow accent color strip and SE models used a wide accent color strip, with Voyager SEs with the Rallye package receiving [...] "Rallye" [...] badges on the front doors. Caravan ES and Voyager LEs used the base model's narrow accent color molding combined with a full accent color effect on the lower portion of the doors. The vinyl woodgrain-appearance side paneling was no longer available, as the new side sheetmetal was no longer flat. Early Plymouth Voyagers had a Pentastar front logo and rear badges using the same font as the Caravan, which was changed to Plymouth's new [...] "sailboat" [...] logo and script font on the badges by calendar year 1996. Voyagers and Caravans were only differentiated by their grilles, and some wheel options, while The Town & Country received plastic lower side cladding with chrome strips, unique wheels and a chrome waterfall grille with the Chrysler brand's new ribbon logo. Unique features for the Town & Country included as pre-programmed driver's seat and mirror, standard leather interior, 8-way power adjustable front seats, Infinity sound system with cassette/CD player. As with previous generations, the NS minivan was exported as the Chrysler Voyager, which was a Dodge Caravan modified to meet European safety and lighting standards, while for the 2000 model year it received the Plymouth Voyager's front fascia.In 1997, the Town & Country received standard dual sliding doors and a short wheelbase SX model (not available in Canada), and in 1998 it received a new front fascia, headlamps and wheels. Also in 1998, the Caravan SE dropped, replaced with a new [...] "Sport" [...] model that came with a completely color keyed <b>body,</b> <b>rear</b> spoiler and new wheels, and the Plymouth Voyager Rallye was renamed Expresso, while all models got grocery bag hooks installed on the rear seats. In 1999, the Caravan received standard dual sliding doors, as well as new front fascias, the ES model received revised trim, the [...] "AutoStick" [...] transmission and 17 inch wheels. With the discontinuation of the Plymouth brand, Voyagers produced late in the 2000 model year became Chrysler Voyagers, though they didn't receive any of the trim or options of the European export model.|$|E
40|$|A fast {{obstacle}} avoidance algorithm based on sensor data {{is required for}} an autonomous vehicle to move at high speed.

40|$|To create highly maneuverable projectiles, some {{physical}} control mechanism is needed that {{is capable of}} altering the projectile trajectory in a desiredmanner. The work reported here considers a small flow control device, termed a microspoiler system, located between the rear stabilizing fins of a projectile. Such a mechanism relies on the boundary-layer shock interaction between the projectile <b>body,</b> <b>rear</b> stabilizing fins, and microspoilers to provide a multiplicative effect on controllable forces and moments. To investigate performance of the microspoiler control mechanism, projectile trajectorieswithmicrospoilerswere generated both computationally using a coupledCFDand rigid-body dynamic simulation and experimentally from spark range testing. Using this computational and experimental trajectory information, aerodynamic coefficients both with and without microspoilers were estimated and found to be in good agreementwhere themajor effect of themicrospoiler system is the addition of trim forces and moments along with a slight increase in axial forces. Additionally, control authority of a basic finned projectile equipped with an active microspoiler system is investigated for a typical direct-fire shooting scenario.

40|$|Large-scale {{surfaces}} are prevalent in advanced manufacturing industries, and 3 D profilometry of these surfaces plays {{a pivotal role}} for quality control. This paper proposes a novel and flexible large-scale 3 D scanning system assembled by combining a robot, a binocular structured light scanner and a laser tracker. The measurement principle and system construction of the integrated system are introduced. A mathematical model is established for the global data fusion. Subsequently, a robust method is introduced {{for the establishment of}} the end coordinate system. As for hand-eye calibration, the calibration ball is observed by the scanner and the laser tracker simultaneously. With this data, the hand-eye relationship is solved, and then an algorithm is built to get the transformation matrix between the end coordinate system and the world coordinate system. A validation experiment is designed to verify the proposed algorithms. Firstly, a hand-eye calibration experiment is implemented and the computation of the transformation matrix is done. Then a car <b>body</b> <b>rear</b> is measured 22 times in order to verify the global data fusion algorithm. The 3 D shape of the rear is reconstructed successfully.

40|$|A {{complete}} {{flow control}} over road vehicles {{is difficult to}} achieve because of different phenomena occurring in flow evolution, i. e. the wheel rotation and ground effect deeply influence the flow features. In spite of this, the problem can be approached following different strategies considering both passive and active flow control techniques. The flow around bluff body road vehicle exhibits a massive separation region {{and as a consequence}} the drag is mainly due to pressure losses. The total aerodynamic drag of such bodies can be roughly split into three main contributions. The rolling tire account for up to 25 - 30 % whereas the rear part gives rise to 40 - 45 % of the total drag. The remaining is due to the underbody flow and interferences. The wake structure is greatly influenced by the rear geometry of the body that determines the pressure field in this region. As showed by Ahmed [1] and by Iuso [2] the afterbody geometry plays a key role for the drag contributions and also for drag reduction when passive solutions are adopted. In cases where a square back rear part is imposed by different requirement such as internal space in commercial vehicles, passive or active control techniques can be used to achieve drag reduction. Passive and active vortex generators as those used by Aider et al [3] and piezoelectric vortex generators as proposed by Orazi et al. [4] can be adopted. Also synthetic jets located in the <b>body</b> <b>rear</b> part as done by Park et al. [5] or continuous blowing slots as done by Rouméas et al. [6] have been also used. Since a favorable energy budget is an essential requirement for a real application of active flow control the technique efficiency is of crucial importance. From this point of view very low energy absorption devices or direct drag alleviation are promising possible solutions. In the present study a simplified car geometry has been chosen as a reference shape and a wake control system has been designed based on continuous or synthetic jets. The results of preliminary CFD analysis focused on the investigation of natural and controlled flow behavior are presented here. Moreover, this study has allowed the design of the physical experiment in the wind tunne...|$|E

40|$|Road traffic {{injuries}} {{are the most}} common cause of fatal injuries among children in the European Region (Sethi et al., 2008). Impacting the front passenger seat back is one of the main injury mechanism of AIS 2 + head injuries for children aged 3 - 13 (Bohman et al., 2011 a). Occupant and vehicle kinematics prior to and during a crash play an important role in the probability of the head impacting either the front seat or side door interior while seated in the rear seat. Studies also show that children who are placed on a belt positioning booster are less likely to sustain injuries than if only using a seat belt (Durbin et al., 2003). In a majority of cases with head contacts in frontal impacts, a steering or braking maneuver has preceeded the crash event in an attempt to avoid impact with the other vehicle or object (Bohman et al., 2011 a). In order to understand the principals behind vehicle occupant injuries different anthropomorphic test devices (ATD) are available. The Q 6 is an ATD representation of a six year old child available as both a physical dummy and as a finite element (FE) model. Little is known on its kinematics when in uenced by low longitudinal and lateral accelerations as are present during a pre-crash maneuver. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate and compare the kinematics of the physical Q 6 ATD (Q 6 ATD) and the Q 6 FE-model (Q 6 model) placed on a booster in such maneuvers. Physical tests were carried out comprising two turning maneuver tests (50 km/h, 14 m radius) and six emergency braking maneuver tests from 70 km/h. During the braking maneuver test the Q 6 ATD was positioned in three different positions; upright (T 0), tilted 1 (T 1) and tilted 2 (T 2). Video images and vehicle data was used to analyze the head trajectories during the different maneuver tests. The FE-simulations were carried out using FE models of a Volvo V 60 vehicle <b>body,</b> <b>rear</b> seat, front seat and a model of a booster. The upright positioned Q 6 model was simulated during a turning maneuver pulse similar to the physical turning maneuver test. It was also subjected to a braking maneuver pulse corresponding to the physical braking test. The same brake pulse was then used to carry out tests with the Q 6 model seated in two different tilted positions, T 1 and T 2. In addition, two methods of pre-tensioning the belt was used for the FE-simulations. The physical tests resulted in the turning maneuver causing the Q 6 ATD to tilt sideways to a 14 angle. The braking maneuvers caused the Q 6 ATD to have a forward forehead displacement of 115 mm (T 0), 130 mm (T 1) and 165 mm (T 2) respectively. The FE turning maneuver caused the Q 6 model to tilt sideways to a 15 angle. The FE braking maneuver caused the Q 6 model with a manual pretensioner to have a forward forehead displacement of 210 mm (T 0), 220 mm (T 1) and 220 mm (T 2). The FE braking maneuver using the automatic pretensioner caused the Q 6 model's forehead to have a forward displacement of 230 mm (T 0), 185 mm (T 1) and 220 mm (T 2). During both the physical tests and the FE-simulations; the forward displacement increased with a larger tilting angle prior to braking. The Q 6 ATD and Q 6 model showed similar behavior, as the tilting angle prior to braking had similar effects on the Q 6 ATD and Q 6 model. In pre-crash scenarios when turning occurs before braking, it is concluded that both the Q 6 ATD's and the Q 6 model's head has a greater longitudinal displacement with increasing tilting angle. This indicates that a combination of pre-crash maneuvers, may increase the risk of impacting the head. While using the Q 6 model for low pulse maneuvers has proven to be possible, it is important to keep in mind that both the Q 6 ATD and Q 6 model are designed for crash scenarios and are not validated for low pulse simulations. In order to use the Q 6 ATD and Q 6 model as a tool for evaluating child kinematics during pre-crash maneuvers comparisons with data from driving studies with real children need to be carried out...|$|E
