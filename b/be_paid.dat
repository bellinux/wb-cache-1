5|$|Despite this, the Scottish Government {{refused to}} pay for {{concessionary}} travel for the tram scheme, as it does for all bus routes in Scotland. Talks between the Scottish Government and Edinburgh Council eventually decided that concession cards should be valid for tram travel, but that they should <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> for by the Council instead of the Government. It was revealed on 15 August 2013 that the cards would be valid, and that travel would <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> for by Edinburgh Council. However, only people with cards issued in Edinburgh {{would be able to}} use them. This compromise upset many people in the Lothians, who often commute or travel into Edinburgh.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} wage rates and wage scales was {{drastically}} reduced; {{this not only}} cut bureaucracy, but also ensured that workers would be more eager {{to take on a}} wider range of tasks. Time workers, for example, would <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> the same regardless of which task they carried out during their shift. This allowed managers to better distribute labour and reduce the frequency of bottlenecks occurring in production. They could do this because workers would <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> a similar rate no matter what they undertook, so it became easier to move workers between tasks.|$|E

5|$|After long negotiations, Portugal {{signed a}} treaty with Brazil on 29 August 1825 {{in which it}} {{recognized}} Brazilian independence. Except for the recognition of independence, the treaty provisions were at Brazil's expense, including a demand for reparations to <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> to Portugal, with no other requirements of Portugal. Compensation was to <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> to all Portuguese citizens residing in Brazil for the losses they had experienced, such as properties which had been confiscated. JoãoVI was also given the right to style himself emperor of Brazil. More humiliating was that the treaty implied that independence had been granted as a beneficent act of JoãoVI, rather than having been compelled by the Brazilians through force of arms. Even worse, Great Britain was rewarded for its role in advancing the negotiations by the signing of a separate treaty in which its favorable commercial rights were renewed and by the signing of a convention in which Brazil agreed to abolish slave trade with Africa within four years. Both accords were severely harmful to Brazilian economic interests.|$|E
