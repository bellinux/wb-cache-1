50|$|<b>Bingo</b> <b>Bango</b> <b>Bongo</b> is a points-based {{game that}} can be played by two or more players or teams. In <b>Bingo</b> <b>Bango</b> <b>Bongo,</b> three types of {{achievements}} are rewarded with a point. The first player in a group to get his ball on the green gets a point (bingo). The player in the group whose ball is closest to the pin once all balls are on the green gets a point (bango). And the player in the group who is first to hole out gets a point (bongo). Lowest score on hole wins 2 points, but if 2 players tie, all tie, which means no points are given out. At {{the end of the}} game the player with the most points wins the money which comes from the other players in individual play or the other team. The amount of money can be a certain amount for 18 holes or for Team-play a certain amount for each hole. <b>Bingo</b> <b>Bango</b> <b>Bongo</b> is considered a game for skilled players, and its point-based scoring makes it a popular side-game for wagering.|$|E

5000|$|Gilligan's Island {{producer}} Sherwood Schwartz had his pilot episodes for {{the show}} rejected twice and decided he needed a new theme song. Working with composer George Wyle {{he came up with}} a folk song that told the back story of the castaways, and hired The Wellingtons to sing it. The song was a hit. The Wellingtons appear in a second season (1965-66) episode as a rock group called [...] "The Mosquitoes." [...] Not only is the insect-named moniker a play on The Beatles, but the members of the fictitious group are named <b>Bingo,</b> <b>Bango,</b> <b>Bongo</b> and Irving in a reverse play on the names John, Paul, George and Ringo.|$|E

[...] Ethnomusicologist Thomas Turino points out that Glazer's depiction of the jungle setting is far removed from the topography of Southern Africa.

50|$|Extreme Battle Piff Paff Poof {{originated}} in Okehampton, UK, {{in the late}} 2000s with annual developments creating its current game play. The games main structure is still based around the popular <b>Bingo</b> <b>Bango</b> <b>Bongo</b> but each point gained also adds to one Battle Play. Battle play equates to the removal of a club from one of your opponents - excluding their putter.

The game is best played over 9 holes and adds great enjoyment when watching a player tee off a short par 3 with a very open 4 iron or trying to hit a pitching wedge 200 yards.|$|E
