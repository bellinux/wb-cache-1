50|$|A <b>trailer</b> <b>bus</b> or {{articulated}} <b>trailer</b> <b>bus</b> is a bus formed {{out of a}} bus bodied semi-trailer {{pulled by}} a conventional tractor unit {{in the same way}} as a conventional articulated semi-trailer truck.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, the KONI Group, {{manufacturer}} of shock absorbers {{was added to}} the list of acquisitions and remains a leader worldwide as the quality shock absorber specialist, focusing solely on high performing suspension-damping technology for Cars, Racing, Specialty Trucks, <b>Busses,</b> <b>Trailers,</b> Locomotives and Railway Rolling Stock.|$|R
50|$|Initially, the {{trolleybus}} service ran at a headway of 7.5 minutes, which compared favourably {{with the}} eight-minute headway of the trams. From 1963, nine <b>bus</b> <b>trailers</b> {{were available to}} augment the trolleybuses during rush hour. In {{the second half of}} the 1990s, the original overhead wires and the depot were fully renewed.|$|R
5000|$|Karosa B 40 is two-axle <b>bus</b> <b>trailer</b> (trailer). Trailers had semi {{self-supporting}} body {{based on}} the [...] "mountain buses" [...] Tatra 500 HB, which Karosa also produced. Conceptually was B 40 {{based on the}} trailer Karosa D 4, which was produced {{at the turn of}} the 1940s to 1950s. B 40 had a metal body of steel-voltage extruded profiles, which were electrically welded to each other. The exterior of the trailer was flashing, the interior was lined with wood-fiber plates. The axle beams were hung on the bottom shelf of the body. The front axle was manageable. Passenger seats were distributed differently. trailers made in Karosa had longitudinal bench seat with one cross on each forehead trailer. Trailers from Letňanské strojírny (B were identified as 40 A) had the seat positioned transversely. Loading and unloading was done by one manually operated, so-called percussion doors on the right side panel.|$|E
50|$|The first project {{concept of}} trailer for public {{transport}} appeared in 1958. It {{was decided to}} manufacture buses of unified series Karosa SB (length 10 m), Škoda 706 RTO (11 m) and Škoda 706 RTO-K (articulated, 16 m), trailer Karosa B 50 and trailer NO 80. the prototype <b>bus</b> <b>trailer</b> was made {{at the end of}} the year 1960 and in January 1961 was introduced to the professional public, and then was put into trial operation. As the tractor could be used truck 706 RTTN or Tatra 137. The advantage of a personal trailer was a possibility it anytime disconnect and replace trailer cargo (such as import workers for the construction and then the material on the site). Prospectively, there was also the military option. But at the time of construction of the prototype developed Karosa new bus Š series, so that a unified series with mass production finally received only bus RTO.|$|E
50|$|Formats include single-decker bus, {{double-decker}} bus (both usually with a rigid chassis) and articulated bus (or 'bendy-bus') {{the prevalence of}} which varies from country to country. Bi-articulated buses are also manufactured, and passenger-carrying trailers—either towed behind a rigid bus (a <b>bus</b> <b>trailer)</b> or hauled as a trailer by a truck (a trailer bus). Smaller midibuses have a lower capacity and open-top buses are typically used for leisure purposes. In many new fleets, particularly in local transit systems, a shift to low-floor buses is occurring, primarily for easier accessibility. Coaches are designed for longer-distance travel and are typically fitted with individual high-backed reclining seats, seat belts, toilets, and audio-visual entertainment systems, and can operate at higher speeds with more capacity for luggage. Coaches may be single- or double-deckers, articulated, and often include a separate luggage compartment under the passenger floor. Guided buses are fitted with technology {{to allow them to}} run in designated guideways, allowing the controlled alignment at bus stops and less space taken up by guided lanes than conventional roads or bus lanes.|$|E

50|$|Towing cars type B 40 were {{produced}} in the Vysoké Mýto in years 1953 to 1957, according to other sources until 1959. Moving production to Letňany was apparently carried out {{in connection with the}} start of serial production of buses Škoda 706 RTO in Karosa. Letňanské strojírny then continued in a production of trailer B 40 until 1962. <b>Bus</b> <b>trailers</b> B 40 has been widely used on routes of Czechoslovak state automobile transport in industrial areas that were drying off for buses in peak working days. Trailers are also applied in urban transport, although in smaller quantities. In some cities (Ostrava, Pardubice, Plzeň and Zlín) were even on the busiest routes coupled with trolleybuses. In normal operation, trailers B 40 maintained until the 1970s.|$|R

50|$|It {{has three}} {{existing}} plants and {{facilities in the}} Philippines. Two of them are located in Quezon City and the third one at Sto. Tomas, Pampanga. It has a tested capacity of a minimum of sixty units of bus and truck bodies a month. It has supplied the majority of bus bodies for the government-owned corporations like the Metro Manila Transit Corporation and the PNR (Phil. National Railways) Motor Service. Before the introduction of these articulated buses, Del Monte has pioneered in the manufactured of <b>bus</b> <b>trailers</b> with a capacity of 200 passengers which were operated by MMTC in EDSA and by a private bus operator in the long stretch Marcos Highway. It was also involved in the assembly and rehabilitation of the British Leyland double deckers used to be operated by the same MMTC.|$|R

Brennan of Maine, who served from 1979 to 1987. There are early horse-drawn wagons and a prairie schooner, {{which is a}} scaled-down covered wagon. The museum also includes early motorcycles, mopeds, a few bicycles, snowplows and a snow roller, which are important for the Maine winters, farm tractors, a potato harvester, a horse-drawn hearse, a <b>bus,</b> <b>trailers</b> pulled by trucks, and delivery trucks of dairy products and ice. A special room includes a command car used in World War II, in which Galen Cole had been a young soldier. [...] There are also outdoor military vehicle exhibits of both World War II and the Vietnam War.|$|R
50|$|In some {{countries}} of the European Union, {{as well as in}} the United States and Canada, an articulated bus can be driven with the same license used to drive a rigid bus (D in Europe), while a bus towing a normal <b>trailer</b> requires a <b>bus</b> + <b>trailer</b> (D+E) license. However, special training is needed for bi-articulated buses.|$|R
50|$|Trailer buses {{are usually}} pulled by a {{conventional}} truck from various truck manufacturers, {{while others have}} larger space cabs. <b>Trailer</b> <b>bus</b> bodies are built by various local builders.|$|R

5000|$|A rigid bus (either a {{motor bus}} or trolleybus) is a vehicle used in public {{transportation}} with a single, rigid chassis. A bus {{of this type}} is to be contrasted with an articulated or bi-articulated bus, which will have two or more two rigid sections linked by a pivoting joint, and also with a <b>trailer</b> <b>bus,</b> which is formed out of a bus bodied semi-trailer pulled by a conventional tractor unit.|$|R
50|$|During World War II {{and in the}} {{immediate}} post-war years, trailer buses were turned to as a simple and economical way of providing bus transport to replace worn out conventional bus fleets. The semi-trailers were basic and uncomfortable, but each could carry more passengers than an ordinary single-decker bus, and nearly {{as many as a}} double-decker bus. Indeed at least one double-decker <b>trailer</b> <b>bus</b> was known to have been built for service in Mumbai, India.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} Lausanne {{trolleybus}} system, the Lucerne system {{is one of}} only two trolleybus systems worldwide that still utilise the rigid concace <b>bus</b> and the <b>trailer</b> consortium form of operation. In addition, the Lucerne system is, along with the Le-Fond-De-L'eau and Lausanne systems, one of only three trolleybus systems in Switzerland still using rigid vehicles. An ongoing process called operation dismantle projects re-use parts of the long serving buses as gifts to the Cuban transportation system.|$|R
50|$|The train used {{distributed}} traction; the end (driving) cars in a train {{would have}} contained either transformer and rectifier, or hybrid electrical generation apparatus and rectifier, depending on version, {{but would not}} have powered axles. The passenger carriages could be powered, with a traction converter supplied by the train's power <b>bus,</b> or unpowered, <b>trailer</b> vehicles. In ten-car trains the formation was (2'2')(Bo'Bo')(2'2')(Bo'Bo')(2'2')(Bo'Bo')(2'2')(Bo'Bo')(Bo'Bo')(2'2'), in five-car trains (2'2')(Bo'Bo')(Bo'Bo')(Bo'Bo')(2'2'). The trains could also be configured in formations from 5 to 12 carriages.|$|R
50|$|The {{industry}} {{began with}} the importation in 1898 of two Benz cars from Paris by William McLean. Apart from a few early attempts to build complete cars all chassis were imported. Local coachbuilders, out-priced, finally disappeared in the 1920s though not without representations to government. A few moved to assembly of complete cars or to making <b>bus,</b> truck and <b>trailer</b> bodies, sometimes both. New Zealand assembly of American ckd packs got properly {{under way in the}} 1920s, English ckd packs a full decade later.|$|R
50|$|The {{tour bus}} was heading {{westbound}} from a casino, {{and the truck}} was eastbound when the <b>bus</b> impacted the <b>trailer</b> portion of the truck at about 5:17 a.m. It is unknown whether drugs, alcohol or fatigue were factors in the accident, but {{the speed of the}} bus was so significant that when the bus hit the back of the big rig, the trailer entered approximately 15 ft into the bus. Currently the cause is under investigation, and the truck driver is being interviewed. The bus driver was among those killed.|$|R
50|$|Airside {{transfer}} buses can be {{of normal}} bus design, or due to not running on the public highway, can be extra long and wide, to hold {{the maximum number of}} passengers. Sometimes a <b>trailer</b> <b>bus</b> is employed. Transfer buses are usually fitted with minimal or no seating, with passengers standing for the journey. Sometimes for larger aircraft a coach is used to ferry customers to or from the terminal as coaches hold more people. Transfer buses will usually be fitted with flashing beacons for operating airside near runways. They may also feature driving cabs at both ends.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, {{the types}} and {{features}} of buses have developed {{according to local}} needs. Buses were fitted with technology appropriate to the local climate or passenger needs, such as air conditioning in Asia, or cycle mounts on North American buses. The bus types in use around the world where there was little mass production were often sourced second hand from other countries, such as the Malta bus, and buses in use in Africa. Other countries such as Cuba required novel solutions to import restrictions, {{with the creation of}} the [...] "camellos" [...] (camel bus), a specially manufactured <b>trailer</b> <b>bus.</b>|$|R
