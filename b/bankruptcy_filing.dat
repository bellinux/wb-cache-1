5|$|Following {{the release}} of Extra Mile, a band from Kentucky {{threatened}} to sue Shenandoah {{over the use of}} the name Shenandoah. After a financial settlement was made with the Kentucky band, two other bands filed lawsuits over Shenandoah's name. The lawsuits depleted the money earned by the band on the road, which led to the band asking the label and their production company to all pay one-third of their legal costs. The production company refused, and Shenandoah was forced to filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 1991 after paying more than 2 million dollars on court settlements and legal fees. Although the lawsuits allowed Shenandoah to keep its name, the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>filing</b> terminated the contract with Columbia after a 1992 Greatest Hits package. The production company's officials then filed a lawsuit against the band, claiming that it had tried to void its agreement with them. After Shenandoah's departure, there were no other bands on Columbia's Nashville division; as a result, producer Larry Strickland assembled three musicians to create a new band called Matthews, Wright & King in an attempt to keep a commercially successful band on the label.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, 30,000 {{vehicles}} a day {{traveled on}} the expressway, which fulfilled state expectations; however, complaints were {{made about the}} toll machines, due to their low height and needing the exact amount of the toll. In late 2009, the South Bay Expressway partnership that operated the road questioned {{the value of the}} toll road for property tax purposes, saying that it was worth $330 million less than it was originally valued due to the low volumes of traffic using the road. On March 22, 2010, the toll road's operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing traffic counts running at less than 40 percent of initial estimates due to the economic downturn. Some drivers chose not to use the toll road due to a recent increase in tolls. An editorial in the San Diego Union-Tribune also blamed the delay in opening the toll road and the associated penalties, interest, and legal fees for the company's financial status. According to the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>filing,</b> the expressway had $510 million of loans outstanding, of which $170 million was owed to the U.S. Department of Transportation. In addition, there was over $600 million of unresolved litigation with the construction contractors. The gross earnings (EBITDA) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 were approximately $3 million on revenues of $21 million.|$|E
40|$|Beginning in the 1990 s, firms often {{continue}} {{to trade on}} the major national exchanges after Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings. For <b>bankruptcies</b> <b>filed</b> from 1993 - 2003, {{we find that the}} more negative the filing period price reaction, the more favorable the immediate post- filing returns, on average. This reversal is not attributable to bid-ask bounce, it holds after controlling for other factors associated with post-filing returns, and it appears more attributable to the activities of large traders than to small traders. Supplementary tests reveal that the pattern of post-filing returns differs significantly for <b>bankruptcies</b> <b>filed</b> in bull versus bear markets. <b>Bankruptcies</b> <b>filed</b> during the 1993 to 1999 bull market enjoy substantial but short-lived reversals averaging one-third of the filing period price plunge. These reversals are inconsistent with efficient assimilation of the bankruptcy information. In contrast, we find no evidence of post-filing reversals for <b>bankruptcies</b> <b>filed</b> from 2000 to 2003...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of {{factors related to}} trends {{in the incidence of}} personal nonbusiness bankruptcy is important to credit managers as well as to economists. This study updates and extends to 1982 an earlier study of economic factors associated with the incidence of bankruptcy from 1950 to 1970. This study shows that the incidence of personal bankruptcy follows movements in a measure of the aggregate household debt burden (total consumer credit outstanding relative to disposable personal income). Unlike the earlier study, we found that independent measures of willingness to <b>file</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> were also significantly associated with the number of <b>bankruptcies</b> <b>filed</b> per 100, 000 of population. Our study also indicates that the enactment of the Bankruptcy Reform Act was followed by {{a significant increase in the}} incidence of personal bankruptcy. Holding other conditions constant, our model suggests that about 50 percent of such <b>bankruptcies</b> <b>filed</b> in 1982 were attributable to the new law...|$|R
