5|$|In France, the premiership of Aristide Briand, {{a leading}} proponent of {{engaging}} with Constantine to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> reconciliation {{of the two}} Greek administrations, was threatened by the events in Athens, leading to the reorganization of the French government. In Britain, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and foreign minister Sir Edward Grey resigned and were replaced by Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour. The change in the British leadership proved to be particularly important for Greece, since Lloyd George was a known Hellenophile, an admirer of Venizelos and dedicated to resolving the Eastern Question.|$|E
5|$|Pitt's {{administration}} {{took the}} guilty verdict in Paine's trial {{as a sign}} that further prosecutions for sedition were possible, and began many. In the 17 months following the trial, 11 publishers of the Rights of Man were prosecuted, receiving prison sentences of up to 4 years. These acted as a prelude to the 1794 Treason Trials, in which a dozen reformers were indicted for allegedly conspiring to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> revolution. Erskine played a prominent role in defending many of them, including Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke and John Thelwall, all three of whom were acquitted.|$|E

5|$|The {{war between}} France and the Emperor broke out {{once again in}} September 1551. In due course Northumberland {{rejected}} requests for English help from both sides, which {{in the case of}} the Empire consisted of a demand for full-scale war based on an Anglo-Imperial treaty of 1542. The Duke pursued a policy of neutrality, a balancing act that made peace between the two great powers attractive. In late 1552 he undertook to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> European peace by English mediation. These moves were taken seriously by the rival resident ambassadors, but were ended in June 1553 by the belligerents, the continuance of war being more advantageous to them.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to defeat}} Agesilaus' army, Pharnabazus decided to force Agesilaus to {{withdraw}} by stirring up {{trouble on the}} Greek mainland. He dispatched Timocrates of Rhodes, an Asiatic Greek, to distribute ten thousand gold darics in the major cities of the mainland and incite them to act against Sparta. Timocrates visited Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Argos, and succeeded in persuading powerful factions {{in each of those}} states to pursue an anti-Spartan policy. The Thebans, who had previously demonstrated their antipathy towards Sparta, undertook to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> war.|$|E

Hsing has a child by Hiroshi, but Hiroshi dies soon afterward, of heart failure. The ship's educational curriculum is revised, and all schools are required to allow teachers who are not angels to teach material relevant to living on the new planet. The new planet proves to be habitable by humans, and around a quarter of the ship's population moves to it, settling down despite the difficulty of learning to live on a planet again. The ship leaves, not intending to return.|$|E

5|$|During his lifetime, Takechi's {{innovations}} {{and contributions}} to Japanese theater {{in general and}} to kabuki specifically were influential for decades. His theoretical work, {{as well as his}} mentoring of several important stars, helped <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> rebirth in kabuki after World War II. His contributions to cinema were much more controversial. Considered a dilettante outsider by much of the film industry, and suspected of racism and nationalism by others, his work was nevertheless defended by the younger generation of filmmakers such as Seijun Suzuki and Nagisa Oshima. Though his films are today unknown to most Japanese filmgoers, through his career-long fight against censorship, the taboos which his films helped break, and the creative freedom which he helped enable, he remains an important figure in Japanese cinema.|$|E
5|$|Ramanujam Iyengar alias Ambi is an {{orthodox}} Brahmin and a straightforward consumer protection advocate living in Triplicane, Chennai. He expects everyone {{to follow the}} law and prosecutes those who violate it. However, his efforts fail as circumstantial evidence always seems to favour the accused. He also fails to raise civic awareness due to pervasive corruption and {{a general lack of}} seriousness. Frustrated at his inability to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> change in society, his suppressed anger manifests itself in an alter-ego named Anniyan, a grim reaper-themed serial killer who punishes corrupt and indifferent people. Anniyan creates a website, compiles a list of wrongdoers from his site, and kills them using punishments described in the Garuda Puranam, one of the ancient Hindu scriptures.|$|E
5|$|Sex-positive feminist writer Susie Bright {{called the}} Magic Wand {{one of her}} two {{favorite}} vibrators, and called it a miracle that the device was able to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> orgasm in under sixty seconds. Bright wrote about her experience using the Magic Wand to relieve discomfort during childbirth. Author Kathy Shaidle wrote that the massager is able to give females multiple orgasms. Shaidle wrote that its effectiveness was not hampered by its appearance which brought to mind objects featured in the MÃ¼tter Museum. Sociologist, sexologist and sex-positive feminist Carol Queen critiqued the carbon footprint of the Magic Wand because it was imported from Japan, and praised its environmentally friendly qualities including its lack of batteries, and durability compared to other vibrators.|$|E

Seventeen years before the start of Silent Hill 3, in the year 1983, Harry Mason defeated a god brought forth by the resident cult of Silent Hill and at the ending, was given a baby girl to care for. The protagonist and player character of Silent Hill 3 is Heather, the teenaged adopted daughter of Harry. Claudia Wolf, the cult's priestess who plans to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> paradise on Earth, serves as the game's antagonist. As Heather attempts to unravel the reasons why the cult of Silent Hill is pursuing her, she encounters a private investigator named Douglas Cartland; Vincent, a member of the cult who detests Claudia; and Leonard Wolf, Claudia's abusive father.|$|E
5|$|The British War Office's stated {{policy in}} October 1916 was to {{maintain}} offensive operations on the Western Front, while {{remaining on the}} defensive everywhere else. However, the battle of attrition on the Somme, coupled with a change of Britain's prime minister, with David Lloyd George succeeding H. H. Asquith on 7 December, destabilised the status quo sufficiently to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> policy reversal, making attacks on the Central Powers' weak points away from the Western Front desirable. The commander of the EEF, General Sir Archibald Murray, was encouraged to seek success on his eastern frontier, but without any reinforcements. He thought that an advance to El Arish was possible, and that such an advance would threaten forces in the southern Ottoman Empire and, if not prevent, at least slow the transfer of German and Ottoman units to other theatres of war from the Levant.|$|E
5|$|The series' central {{characters}} are Lightning, a former soldier and the core character {{in all three}} games; Serah Farron, Lightning's sister and the second game's main protagonist; Snow Villiers, an optimistic young man engaged to Serah; Hope Estheim, {{a young man who}} develops a strong bond with Lightning; Sazh Katzroy, a former airship pilot; Oerba Dia Vanille and Oerba Yun Fang, two women who inadvertently set the first game's events in motion. Three further characters appear in XIII-2: Noel Kreiss, a hunter who sets out to change his bleak future; Caius Ballad, a man from Noel's past who wishes to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> predestined apocalypse; and Paddra Nsu-Yeul, a seeress reincarnated through history. In Lightning Returns, two more are added: Lumina, a doppelganger of Serah; and Bhunivelze, the main deity of the Final Fantasy XIII universe.|$|E

5|$|Whereas Henry VII had not {{involved}} Parliament in his affairs very much, Henry VIII {{had to turn}} to Parliament during his reign for money, in particular for grants of subsidies to fund his wars. The Dissolution of the Monasteries provided a means to replenish the treasury, {{and as a result}} the Crown took possession of monastic lands worth Â£120,000 (Â£36million) a year. The Crown had profited a small amount in 1526 when Wolsey had put England onto a gold, rather than silver, standard, and had debased the currency slightly. Cromwell debased the currency more significantly, starting in Ireland in 1540. The English pound halved in value against the Flemish pound between 1540 and 1551 as a result. The nominal profit made was significant, helping to bring income and expenditure together, but it had a catastrophic effect on the overall economy of the country. In part, it helped to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> period of very high inflation from 1544 onwards.|$|E
5|$|In 692/693, the Byzantine emperor Justinian II (reigned 685â695 and 705â711) and the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685â705) {{broke the}} truce that had existed between Byzantium and the Umayyad Caliphate since 679, {{following}} the failed Muslim {{attack on the}} Byzantine capital, Constantinople. The Byzantines secured great financial and territorial advantages from the truce, which they extended further by exploiting the Umayyad government's involvement in the Second Muslim Civil War (680â692). However, by 692 the Umayyads were clearly emerging as the victors in the conflict, and Abd al-Malik consciously {{began a series of}} provocations to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> resumption of warfare. Justinian, confident in his own strength based on his previous successes, responded in kind. Finally, the Umayyads claimed that the Byzantines had broken the treaty and invaded Byzantine territory, defeating the imperial army at the Battle of Sebastopolis in 693. In its aftermath, the Arabs quickly regained control over Armenia and resumed their attacks into the border zone of eastern Asia Minor, that would culminate in the second attempt to conquer Constantinople in 716â718. Furthermore, Justinian was deposed in 695, beginning a twenty-year period of internal instability that almost brought the Byzantine state to its knees.|$|E
5|$|Lihau {{traveled}} to the secessionist State of Katanga in November {{to negotiate with the}} rebellious province's leaders. He assisted in organising and subsequently took part in the LÃ©opoldville Conference in January 1961 to discuss political compromise and reform. He also participated in the Tananarive Conference in March and the following Coquilhatville Conference in April on behalf of IlÃ©o to try and <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> reconciliation among the dissident factions in the Congo. As result of the latter conference, IlÃ©o created a commission to prepare a new constitution for the Congo and appointed Lihau to chair it. Lihau {{played a key role in}} the drafting process from that point forward. In June he joined Cyrille Adoula and Jean Bolikango in negotiating with the representatives of the Stanleyville government. Their meetings continued into July and resulted in the reconvening of Parliament and the Stanleyville government agreeing to disband. In January 1963 Lihau was hired to be professor and dean of the faculty of law at the University of Lovanium (later the National University of Zaire). He encouraged his students to adopt a constitutionalist approach to law.|$|E
