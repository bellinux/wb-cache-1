5|$|Soedrajat abuses {{his high}} social status {{in order to}} womanise and becomes his rich uncle's heir despite the latter having a son, the kindly and noble Soelarsa. The uncle is {{disappointed}} with Soelarsa and considers Soedrajat the <b>better</b> <b>man.</b> Being considered high class, he is unwilling to associate with people of the lower classes. Ultimately Soedrajat falls for a beautiful young woman, Koestijah. Meanwhile, Soelarsa saves Koestijah's life while driving a truck through her village; the two fall in love at first sight. By manipulating Koestijah's father, Soedrajat arranges for her to marry him.|$|E
5|$|The hero's inseparable {{companion}} was his powerful, talking {{piebald horse}} Šarac; Marko always {{gave him an}} equal share of his wine. The horse could leap three spear-lengths high and four spear-lengths forward, enabling Marko to capture the dangerous, elusive vila Ravijojla. She became his blood sister, promising to help him in dire straits. When Ravijojla helped him kill the monstrous, three-hearted Musa Kesedžija (who almost defeated him), Marko grieved because he had slain a <b>better</b> <b>man</b> than himself.|$|E

5|$|Dannatt was {{appointed}} Chief of the General Staff (CGS) in August 2006, succeeding General Sir Mike Jackson. Dannatt faced controversy over his outspokenness, in particular his calls for improved pay and conditions for soldiers {{and for a}} drawdown of operations in Iraq in order to <b>better</b> <b>man</b> those in Afghanistan. He also set about trying to increase his public profile, worried {{that he was not}} recognisable enough {{at a time when he}} had to defend the Army's reputation against alleged prisoner abuse in Iraq. He later assisted with the formation of Help for Heroes to fund a swimming pool at Headley Court and, later in his tenure, brokered an agreement with the British press that allowed Prince Harry to serve in Afghanistan. He was succeeded as CGS by Sir David Richards and retired in 2009, taking up the largely honorary post of Constable of the Tower of London, which he held until July 2016.|$|E

Amelia and Dobbin are reconciled and return to England. Becky and Jos stay in Europe. Jos dies, possibly suspiciously, after signing a portion of his money to Becky as life insurance, setting her up with an income. She returns to England, and manages a respectable life, although all her previous friends refuse to acknowledge her.|$|E

Tom recovers from his illness, a steadier and <b>better</b> <b>man</b> for it, and Julia's husband, Mr Yates, proves to be a respectable husband. Henry Crawford refuses to marry Maria. Her shame gives her no other options, so her father sets her up in a house with Aunt Norris (for the role she had played as an ineffectual guardian and role model), the both of them out of his sight. Mary Crawford is forced to move in with her half-sister, Mrs. Grant, hoping for a husband.|$|E

25|$|Granting no {{concession}} to his precarious legal situation, Socrates speaks emotionally and provocatively to the court, {{and says that}} the greatest good to occur upon Athens is his moral concern for them as fellow citizens. That material wealth {{is a consequence of}} goodness; that the god does not permit a <b>better</b> <b>man</b> to be harmed by a lesser man; and that he is the social gadfly required by Athens: “All day long, I will never cease to settle here, there, and everywhere — rousing, persuading, and reproving every one of you.” In support of the moral mission assigned him by the Oracle at Delphi, Socrates tells the court that his daimonion continually forbids him to act unethically. That statement implicitly validates Meletus' accusation that Socrates believes in novel deities not of the Athenian pantheon.|$|E

On January 10, 2008, they {{go out for a}} snowday with Little Adam and have fun building a snowman, throwing snowballs and enjoying each other's company. The two express that they like being a family, just them and Little Adam. When JR talks of being a <b>better</b> <b>man,</b> one that Babe can possibly like again, the two nearly kiss. Babe stops the intimate encounter before it can happen and reminds JR that when they become romantic with each other, it never lasts and ends in destruction. JR tells Babe that he loves her and asks her to give them another chance, but as friends first and see where it leads. Babe, hesitant at first, accepts his request.|$|E
25|$|McMahon {{then began}} to lead his WCW wrestlers against his father and the WWF wrestlers, {{eventually}} turning heel by joining forces with Paul Heyman and his brand of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) wrestlers, along with their new owner, McMahon's sister Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley. Calling themselves The Alliance, they pledged to finally run the WWF (and specifically their father) out of business. Ultimately, The Invasion {{came to a head}} at Survivor Series in a match to determine which power would ultimately have control. The team, each respectively representing The Alliance and the WWF, of McMahon, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Rob Van Dam, and Booker T lost to the team of The Rock, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and Big Show. The following night on Raw, Vince publicly fired both Shane and Stephanie, which Shane took in stride, admitting that he lost to the <b>better</b> <b>man,</b> while Stephanie pleaded with her father before being forcefully removed from the arena. Aside from a brief appearance on the July 15, 2002 episode of Raw, McMahon would not be seen on television for almost two years.|$|E

25|$|For his self-defence, Socrates first {{eliminates}} {{any claim}} {{that he is a}} wise man. He says that Chaerephon, reputed to be impetuous, went to the Oracle of Delphi and asked her, the Pythia, to tell him of anyone who was wiser than Socrates. The Pythia answered to Chaerephon that there was no man wiser. On learning of that oracular pronouncement, Socrates says he was astounded, because, on the one hand, it is against the nature of the Oracle to lie, but, on the other hand, he knew he was not wise. Therefore, Socrates sought to find someone wiser than himself, so that he could take that person as evidence to the Oracle at Delphi. Hence why Socrates minutely queried everyone who appeared to be a wise person. In that vein, he tested the minds of politicians, poets, and scholars, for wisdom; although he occasionally found genius, Socrates found no one who possessed wisdom; yet, each man was thought wise by the people, and each man thought himself wise; therefore, he (Socrates) was the <b>better</b> <b>man,</b> because he was aware that he was not wise.|$|E
25|$|On {{board the}} Jolly Roger, a young Killian is consoled by his father, Brennan, who promised his son {{that he would}} become the person that he was meant to be, only to {{suddenly}} abandon him and his brother, as he sold his sons into servitude, because Brennan was a wanted man and the ship was stolen. Years later in The Enchanted Forest, Regina recruits Hook to kill Cora, and takes Hook to a tavern, where she requires Hook to kill his father, {{who is now the}} tavern's owner. After the tavern closes, Hook confronts Brennan, who explains that his attempt to flee the law failed and was put under a sleeping curse as punishment; Brennan {{fell in love with the}} sound of his nurse's voice and she with him, allowing a kiss to wake him. They married, but she died soon after having their son, who was named after Liam, to honor his memory. Believed that Brennan has changed, Hook has to make it look like he had his father killed, so he can help his father and Liam escape. When Hook follows Brennan back to his home, he watches him with Liam, and witnesses his father tells Liam the same things he told Hook when he was little, which makes Hook very enraged, thinking that his father lied about having changed. When Brennan goes outside to meet Hook, he takes back his offer, and despite Brennan's insistence that he had changed, Hook kills Brennan, making Hook the person he is now. As Brennan dies, however, he tells Hook that it's never too late to change, to become a <b>better</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] {{are about a}} gender-swapping thought experiment, through which Beyoncé {{analyses}} the ideologies of a tense relationship. As she sings about things she would do {{if she were a}} boy, Beyoncé highlights the vulnerability of a woman and ponders how things would be different if men had women's sense of empathy. During {{the first part of the}} ballad, Beyoncé alternates between the role of her flawed partner and that of the <b>better</b> <b>man</b> she would be. In the first verse, she envisions herself impersonating her unfeeling love interest as she sings about consuming beer with other men, chasing after girls, and treating her lover cruelly, before adding that she would never be confronted for it. Beyoncé then sings the chorus, in which she gives her vision of life as a <b>better</b> <b>man,</b> [...] "I think I could understand / How it feels to love a girl / I swear I'd be a better man", because she knows [...] "how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted / 'cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed".|$|E
