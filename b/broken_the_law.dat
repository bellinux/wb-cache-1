Starling {{admitted}} that he had <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> by using the dog twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E

Footage that they have recorded has also been uploaded onto YouTube in an attempt to catch people they believe have reoffended.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Masonic brotherhood {{probably}} descends from a 16th-century {{legal definition}} of a brother as one who has taken an oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a Volume of Sacred Law, whichever book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In Progressive continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are permissible, a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges.|$|E

According to Dotcom, about 80 police officers {{were involved in the}} operation; the New Zealand police claimed it was between 20 and 30.

Eirik on his side preached against the king and his men, and sent letters of complaint to the Pope, but in the short term his offensive weapons were few. In 1190 Sverre attempted to force the archbishop into submission, claiming that Eirik had <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> by having 90 armed men in his service. According to law, the archbishop's guard was limited to 30 men. Rather than submit to the king's will, Eirik fled to Lund where the Danish archbishop had his seat.

25|$|Coast Air {{started its}} first head-on {{competition}} with Scandinavian Airlines on 2 June 2003. Using the ATR 42, it introduced two daily services from Haugesund to Oslo. By September this had increased to three, and tickets were selling {{as low as}} NOK500. SAS responded with a 22-percent cut in ticket prices. Coast Air lost NOK11 million on the price war during 2003, and was ultimately forced {{to withdraw from the}} route in May 2004. The case was investigated by the Norwegian Competition Authority based on accusations of SAS carrying out illegal price dumping on the route. They issued a fine of NOK20 million, but the case ended in Oslo District Court, where Scandinavian Airlines was acquitted. Though initially appealed by the authority, the matter was settled out-of-court in December 2007, in which the airline agreed that they had <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> but that since it took place immediately the act came into power, they would not have to pay the fine.|$|E
25|$|On 2 June 2003, Coast Air {{started its}} first head-on {{competition}} with Scandinavian Airlines. Using the ATR planes, Coast Air started with two daily round services between Haugesund and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. By September, Coast Air increased to three daily round trips, and reduced prices to NOK500. From 9 October, Scandinavian Airlines reduced their prices by 22% {{on the route}}. On 16 February, Coast Air also started competing with Braathens and Widerøe on the route between Stavanger and Bergen, marketing it as a low-fare service and ticket prices as low as NOK199. The Haugesund–Oslo route cost Coast Air NOK11 million in 2003. In March 2004, Coast Air was forced to close the Stord to Oslo route, after several reductions in frequency during the past year. To create more inertia on the Bergen–Stavanger route, Coast Air also started a cooperation with DAT, where the latter flew an extra daily round trip. Following the losses of the Haugesund–Oslo and Bergen–Stavanger routes, they were terminated in May 2004. In December, the Norwegian Competition Authority started investigating Scandinavian Airlines for illegal price dumping on the Oslo–Haugesund route. The authority suspected that SAS had illegally cross-subsidized the route {{to fend off the}} competition, and announced the company would be fined NOK20 million. The case ended in Oslo District Court, where Scandinavian Airlines was found not guilty. Though initially appealed by the authority, the matter was settled out-of-court in December 2007, in which the airline agreed that they had <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> but that since it happened just after the act came into power, they would not have to pay the fine.|$|E
