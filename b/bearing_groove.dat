40|$|The {{application}} range of modern machine tool mainspindles is decisively {{limited by the}} used spindle bearings. On the one hand for many applications a high stiffness is necessary {{on the other hand}} a high rotation speed is needed. Conventional spindle bearings can not cope with both requirements at the same time. In this essay a new approach is presented that tries to solve these oppositional ambitions. The form of the <b>bearing</b> <b>groove</b> is modified in a way that causes the osculation in the contact point to decrease with increasing rotational speed caused by the displacement of the balls.

40|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} been carried out in order to assess the {{influence}} of groove activation and deactivation on the performance of a twin axial groove steadily loaded hydrodynamic journal bearing. Temperature distribution at the oil–bush interface, oil outlet temperature, total oil flow rate, partial oil flow rate (at each groove), and motor consumption were measured for several journal speeds and loads under constant feeding pressure (pf) and constant feeding temperature (Tf), at five different loading angles (). In this study, the corresponding groove was deactivated whenever negative oil flow rate was observed in it and results were compared.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The provision of helical grooves {{on the surface of}} a plain journal bearing can improve the stability of a rotor-bearing system. However, the improvement depends on the arrangement of the grooves along the axial length of the bearing. In order to verify this improved stability three types of helical <b>groove</b> <b>bearing</b> and a reference plain journal bearing were investigated. The helical <b>groove</b> journal <b>bearings</b> were: a symmetrical, an asymmetrical and a partial <b>grooved</b> <b>bearing.</b> The bearing test rig was used to measure the oil flow rate, load carrying capacity, power losses, bearing surface temperatures, and stability characteristics. A theoretical model was developed to calculate the load carrying capacity, stiffness and damping coefficients, and stability characteristics of the various types of bearing. The experimental and theoretical results show that at the expense of a reduced load capacity the helical <b>groove</b> <b>bearings</b> are more stable particularly at low eccentricity ratios. However, the experimental observations showed that the partial helical <b>groove</b> <b>bearing</b> is not a practical bearing because the bearing becomes misaligned above certain load. For a given eccentricity ratio and speed the symmetrical bearing ran hotter and with greater power losses in comparison to the other three bearings. At the same eccentricity ratio and speed, the asymmetrical bearing ran at about the same temperature as the plain journal bearing. Financial support was obtained from the Government of Pakistan...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of herringbone <b>grooved</b> journal <b>bearings</b> was increased by optimizing the groove depth, width, length, and angle.

Furthermore, there are no experimental works, to the authors’ knowledge, that compare the performance of single and twin axial <b>groove</b> <b>bearings</b> with the same geometry. An experimental assessment of a journal bearing with either two axial grooves located at +/- 90 º or just one single groove at + 90 º to the load line was performed. The comparison was made by using the same <b>bearing</b> for both <b>groove</b> configurations but the oil feeding to the - 90 º groove was shut with a valve in one of the cases in order to emulate a single <b>groove</b> <b>bearing.</b> Measurements of total and partial lubricant flow rate through each groove, shaft locus, inner bush surface temperature, oil outlet temperature and electrical motor consumption were performed. For the range of applied loads tested the twin <b>groove</b> journal <b>bearing</b> displayed a lower maximum temperature but a higher outlet temperature and eccentricity than the single <b>groove</b> journal <b>bearing.</b> Also the measured total flow rate in the bearing was approximately the same for the single and the twin groove arrangements. For the twin <b>groove</b> <b>bearing,</b> the partial flow rate through each groove varied dramatically with increasing load: At high eccentricities the flow being supplied to the active land of the bearing through the + 90 º groove was much lower than that supplied to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º groove. Actually, the measured flow rate at the + 90 º groove was almost zero for the highest load tested, with nearly all the lubricant being fed to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º groove.
