40|$|Abstract — Most recent {{developments}} in car technology promise that future cars will be equipped with many cameras facing different directions (e. g. : headlights, wing mirrors, <b>break</b> <b>lights</b> etc.). This work investigates the possibility of letting the cameras calibrate and localize themselves relative to each other by tracking one arbitrary and fixed calibration object (e. g. : a traffic sign). Since the fields of view for each camera may not be overlapping, the calibration object serves as logical connection between different views. Under {{the assumption that the}} intrinsic camera parameters and the vehicle’s speed are known, we suggest a method for computing the extrinsic camera parameters (rotation, translation) for a two-camera system, where one camera is defined as the origin.

In this short, almost plotless experimental film Bach sounds outside the frameworks that typically motivate the diegetic presence of so-called ‘classical music’ in cinema, detached from the places and signifiers of high art and from high-level meanings and pointed occurrences. This unusual representation of listening opens up two complementary lines of enquiry: first, into {{the way in which}} Jarmusch draws on Bach to invent a reality that is strange and irreducible, marked by unexpected cultural affiliations and by an elusive affective realm; second, into the way in which, by thus channelling Bach into his poetics of the everyday, the director reinvents the music's own identity, putting forward a de-essentialized image of its cultural placement and aesthetic status...|$|E

50|$|Karlite {{possesses}} moderate optical relief, {{the degree}} to which the mineral grains stand out from the mounting medium. This mineral is orthorhombic and sphenoidal, exhibiting symmetry on 222. Karlite is also enantiomorphic and dihedral. It is a member of the P212121 space group. This mineral forms optically negative biaxial birefringent crystals, meaning that the 2V angle between the optic axes is bisected by the refractive index direction. Because this mineral possesses birefringence, we know it is anisotropic and will display double refraction; it <b>breaks</b> <b>light</b> into two different rays traveling at different speeds in the mineral.|$|R

Severini was the first to come into contact with Cubism and following a visit to Paris in 1911 the Futurist painters adopted the methods of the Cubists. [...] Cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism.|$|R
