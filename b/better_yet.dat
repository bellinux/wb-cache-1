However, {{in contrast}} to glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs selectively activate the GR {{in such a way}} that they yield an improved therapeutic benefit. Generally, for specific inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, or <b>better</b> <b>yet</b> solely transrepress and fail to transactivate. This type of selective GR activation should result in fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.|$|E

25|$|In agriculture, {{many farmers}} could use less fertilizer, and the {{reductions}} in crop yields would be small or nonexistent. Runoff from corn fields is particularly avoidable because corn’s roots penetrate {{only the top}} few inches of soil and assimilate nutrients for only two months of the year. In addition, nitrogen losses can be reduced by 30 percent or more if farmers plant winter cover crops, such as rye or wheat, which can help the soil hold nitrogen. These crops also increase carbon sequestration in soils, mitigating climate change. <b>Better</b> <b>yet</b> is to grow perennial plants such as grasses rather than corn; nitrogen losses are many times lower. Nitrogen pollution from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) is a huge problem.|$|E
25|$|In Romania and Moldova, Epiphany, {{is called}} Boboteaza. In {{south-eastern}} Romania, following religious services, men participate in winter horse races. Before the race, the men {{line up with}} their horses before the priest, who will bless them by sprinkling them with green branches that have been dipped into Epiphany holy water. Sometimes people desire to have this blessing for themselves as well. Winning the Epiphany race is a great honor for both horse and rider, while the post-race celebrations, win or not, are highly festive. As in other Orthodox heritage countries, water rites play a special role on this day. A unique piece of Romanian folk wisdom holds that if a girl slips on ice – or <b>better</b> <b>yet</b> falls into water- on Epiphany, she will surely marry before the year is out.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{the target}} failed to stay {{centered}} in the sighting telescope {{when it was first}} set up. Instead, due to inaccuracies in the estimated wind speed and direction, the target would drift in the sight. To correct for this, the bombardier would use fine-tuning controls to slowly cancel out any motion through trial and error. These adjustments had the effect of updating the measured ground speed used to calculate the motion of the prisms, slowing the visible drift. Over {{a short period of time}} of continual adjustments, the drift would stop, and the bombsight would now hold an extremely accurate measurement of the exact ground speed and heading. <b>Better</b> <b>yet,</b> these measurements were being carried out on the bomb run, not before it, and helped eliminate inaccuracies due to changes in the conditions as the aircraft moved. And by eliminating the manual calculations, the bombardier was left with much more time to adjust his measurements, and thus settle at a much more accurate result.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was mostly mixed. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the [...] "X-File in itself is an interesting concept, but left frustratingly vague." [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, did positively write that the episode is [...] "a character study which gives its new leads some background and depth and, <b>better</b> <b>yet,</b> somewhere new to develop." [...] VanDerWerff later awarded the episode an [...] "C+" [...] and wrote that [...] "there {{are a lot of}} things to like in “Empedocles,” but the central conceit is just too stupid for the episode as a whole to work."

On 20 October, Benfica met Porto in Estádio das Antas for the Clássico. It was an intense match, with 3 ejections and 73 fouls. Porto won 2–1 because to António Tadeira, they [...] "reacted better to playing outnumbered, while Benfica lost their focus when Paulo Costa sent off Éder and then Miguel". Six days later, for the final game of the month, Benfica played Académica at home. The final score of 1–1 was the best possible, because Académica scored the first goal in the 86th minute, giving Benfica only a few minutes to level the game, which Carlitos did in the 90th minute. Benfica ended the month in fifth place, having won only two of nine possible points.|$|E

[...] Morrow also praised the {{acting in the}} episode, saying that [...] "Tonight's episode, in which Michael decides to mediate files filled with official office complaints, is one of this show's finest moments." [...] Michael Sciannamea, of TV Squad, stated that [...] "After a so-so episode last week, this was one was a return to brilliance." [...] Like Morrow, Sciannamea went on to praise {{the work of the}} cast, stating that [...] "The interplay between the cast was top-notch, and even though I've complained much about Dwight's over-the-top behavior, it seemed to work quite well this time around, and actually had a purpose to the story."

500|$|Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} song {{four out of}} five stars, and called it [...] "predictably fizzy" [...] and [...] "fiendishly catchy". Rosen also said that the [...] "lyric, belted out with bright-sided earnestness by Lea Michele and Cory Monteith, distills the show's theme: the mystical power of a good tune and a well-choreographed jazz hands routine to turn geeks into gods". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy wrote, [...] "Max Martin and Shellback chuck the Pinks, Keshas and Katy Perrys into the kitchen sink and add a generous coat of gloss and shimmer (and Auto-Tune) to create what is {{ultimately}} an audacious, unabashed and, crucially, authentic pop stomper that remains true to what Glee is all about". Melinda Newman of HitFix liked the song, but said that it could have had [...] "more of an edge". Newman also said, [...] "For any kid who’s ever been bullied or adult who remembers being bullied, it's a bulls-eye." [...] Newman wrote that Michele, who opens the song, had a [...] "classic voice" [...] but it had no [...] "grit" [...] to it, and recommended that Pink cover it. Becky Bain of Idolator said that the song could have been a track for Pink or Avril Lavigne, two common artists who work with Martin. Bain said the song fit in with [...] "Raise Your Glass", and <b>better</b> <b>yet,</b> Kesha's [...] "We R Who We R". Christopher Rosen of Movieline said the song had [...] "total home run potential", and that it [...] "sounds like a blend of Pink, Katy Perry, Avril Lavigne, early Mandy Moore, and Kidz Bop.

[...] Jason Lipshutz from Billboard gave the song a positive review; he praised Dr. Luke's production and the song's chorus. Lipshutz commented on the song's similarity to [...] "Tik Tok", writing, [...] "Instead of straying from the 'TiK ToK' formula, 'We R Who We R,' ... smartly maximizes [...] most appealing qualities." [...] The review concluded that the song [...] "demonstrates that [...] still has mileage left in her electro-pop sound as she gears up for her next album." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "companion piece" [...] to Pink's [...] "Raise Your Glass" [...] citing their similar subject matter and close releases. Nitsuh Abebe from NY Magazine complimented the song's chorus and trance pop elements. Abebe wrote that the song embodied a [...] "hollowed-out, free-of-yourself feeling", commenting that almost all electronic dance music imbues feelings [...] "that are almost spiritual, that sense of being subsumed and out-of-body". Melinda Newman of HitFix called the song [...] "incredibly stupid, but it has the main ingredients to make it a global hit: an insistent beat and positive lyrics that promise to suspend time and keep us 'forever young,' or <b>better</b> <b>yet,</b> transport us back to a time when we felt like we were." [...] Newman referred to herself as one of the singer's biggest detractors, but wrote [...] "I like one of her songs--or at least begrudgingly admire its crass charms."
