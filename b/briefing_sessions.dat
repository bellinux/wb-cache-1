500|$|Whilst {{each element}} has not {{appeared}} in every Bond film, they are common threads that run {{through most of}} the films. These motifs vary from integral plot points, such as the assignment <b>briefing</b> <b>sessions</b> or the attempts to kill Bond, to enhancements of the dramatic narrative, such as music, or aspects of the visual style, such as the title sequences. These motifs may also serve to enhance excitement in the plot, through a chase sequence or for the climax of the film. Some of these—such as [...] "Bond girls" [...] or megalomaniac villains—have been present in all of the stories, whilst others—such as Q's gadgets or the role of M—have changed over time, often to shape or follow the contemporary zeitgeist. These elements are formulaic and the Bond films tend to follow a set pattern with only limited variety, often following within a strict order. A number of the elements were altered or removed in 2006 with the reboot of the series, Casino Royale.|$|E
