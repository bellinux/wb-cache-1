This article explores the reason for this absorption from the viewpoint of GE's export trading. If we limit ourselves to only some indicators of international cartel and foreign direct investment, we cannot fully examine GE's international　business history. During the interwar period, GE had led international cartels, the　Phoebus Agreement in the electric <b>lamp</b> <b>field,</b> and the International Notification and Compensation Agreement in the electrical apparatus field to protect the American market and to compete in the export market. Because of the segregation of the domestic market from the foreign market and the　different way in which business was　conducted, the structure of IGEC was　appropriate for its international strategy. But World War II changed the export market. First, the war cut off the relationship between IGEC and the London-based cartels. Second, the German and Japanese industries dropped out of the international market. And, after the war, the general demand for electrical apparatus and appliance rose　significantly. In this favorable environment, GE decided to strengthen its export effort. It, however, met with stiff competition from Westinghouse Corporation (WH). In order to compete with WH, GE needed to adapt its own manufacturing facilities to the exporting business. GE then absorbed IGEC and changed its managing structure into a multidivisional one...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{investigation}} of the WFC 3 IR channel internal flat field images taken during Cycles 17, 18, and 19 using the Tungsten # 2 calibration lamp. To complement this data, we also include observations taken during the Thermal Vacuum 3 testing on ground and the Servicing Mission Observatory Verification 4 program. Between the on ground testing in 2008 and the on orbit measurements starting 2009, we find an increase in the lamp flux of about ~ 8 %, consistent with previous investigations. For the on orbit observations, we find that the lamp intensity has been stable within 0. 4 % during the time between SMOV 4 (July 2009) and Cycle 19 (September 2012) and between different filters. This scatter is, however, larger than expected from pure Poisson statistics. Possible systematic effects contributing to the scatter include variations in the flat <b>field</b> <b>lamp</b> flux, effects due to image persistence and systematic effects due to an excessive flagging of pixels as being hit by cosmic rays in the up-the-ramp fitting. We do not find any significant change in the illumination pattern between the three Cycles.

The illumination pattern from the internal flat <b>field</b> <b>lamp</b> is significantly different from that expected from actual science images.

Now, Sir Humphrey was then the great fashionable natural philosopher of the day, the favourite of London society, and the popular lecturer of the Royal Institution. His friends thought it a monstrous idea that his splendid life-saving apparatus should have been independently devised by [...] "an engine-wright of Killingworth of the name of Stephenson--a person not even possessing a knowledge of the elements of chemistry." [...] This sounds very odd reading at the present day, when the engine-wright of the name of Stephenson has altered the whole face of the world, while Davy is chiefly remembered as a meritorious and able chemist; but at the time, Stephenson's claim to the invention met with little courtesy from the great public of London, where a meeting was held on purpose to denounce his right to the credit of the invention. What the coal-owners and colliers of the North Country thought about the matter was sufficiently shown by their subscription of 1000 pounds, as a Stephenson testimonial fund. With part of the money, a silver tankard was presented to the deserving engine-wright, while the remainder of the sum was handed over to him in ready cash. A very acceptable present it was, and one which George Stephenson remembered with pride down to his dying day.

40|$|UV-induced photodesorption of ice is a non-thermal {{evaporation}} {{process that can}} explain the presence of cold molecular gas {{in a range of}} interstellar regions. Information on the average UV photodesorption yield of astrophysically important ices exists for broadband UV <b>lamp</b> experiments. UV <b>fields</b> around low-mass pre-main sequence stars, around shocks and in many other astrophysical environments are however often dominated by discrete atomic and molecular emission lines. It is therefore crucial to consider the wavelength dependence of photodesorption yields and mechanisms. In this work, for the first time, the wavelength-dependent photodesorption of pure CO ice is explored between 90 and 170 nm. The experiments are performed under ultra high vacuum conditions using tunable synchrotron radiation. Ice photodesorption is simultaneously probed by infrared absorption spectroscopy in reflection mode of the ice and by quadrupole mass spectrometry of the gas phase. The experimental results for CO reveal a strong wavelength dependence directly linked to the vibronic transition strengths of CO ice, implying that photodesorption is induced by electronic transition (DIET). The observed dependence on the ice absorption spectra implies relatively low photodesorption yields at 121. 6 nm (Ly-alpha), where CO barely absorbs, compared to the high yields found at wavelengths coinciding with transitions into the first electronic state of CO (singulet Pi at 150 nm); the CO photodesorption rates depend strongly on the UV profiles encountered in different star formation environments.

For the already available DM 150, first of all an entrance optics to correct cosine errors, a thermostatted weathercasing, {{as well as a}} special control <b>lamp</b> device for <b>field</b> use were developped. An international IEA-field intercomparison of 12 spectral radiometers in the Oberpfaffenhofen area of DLR showed deviations between the global radiation spectra of #+-# 15 % and #+-# 40 % for the best and the worst case, resp. The latter was caused by the operational requirements in the field and the mechanical instabilities of some radiometers (including the DM 150). Generally a remarkable portion of the deviations belongs to calibration uncertainties and imperfect cosine corrections. With regard to the summarized experience only principal recommendations on the use of spectral radiometers are given. Measured data of atmospheric heat radiation A and other meteorological data of 16 IEA stations were compiled in a data base at MOH to facilitate the fast uniform validation of 30 formulae for parametrization of A.

The methodological framework of all the LCA techniques {{is based on the}} ISO standards 14040 - 14043. The life cycle analysis is performed using the Gabi 4 software in order to compare environmental impacts of the 15 W CFL and 60 W incandescent lamps providing similar amount of light (800 - 850 lumens). The functional unit is selected according to the operation time of 10. 000 hours. All the materials, energy use and pollutant emissions to the environment from each process were analyzed. The environmental impact was estimated for the 6 environmental impact categories: potentials of Abiotic Depletion, Acidification, Eutrophication, Global Warming, Ozone Layer Depletion, Photochemical Ozone Creation. The results showed that during the operation period of 10, 000 hours of each kind of lamp, the negative impact on the environment of the product is highest in the use phase due to electricity use. According to the analyzed environmental impact categories and from an environmental point of view the CFL is more appropriate source of light than incandescent bulb mainly because of their more efficient use of electricity and due to longer exploitation time.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Buruli ulcer (BU) {{caused by}} Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcerans) {{has emerged as}} an {{important}} public health problem in several rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are important in preventing disfiguring complications associated with late stages of the disease progression. Presently there is no simple and rapid test that is appropriate for early diagnosis and use in the low-resource settings where M. ulcerans is most prevalent. METHODOLOGY: We compared conventional and pocket warmer loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods (using a heat block and a pocket warmer respectively as heat source for amplification reaction) {{for the detection of}} M. ulcerans in clinical specimens. The effect of purified and crude DNA preparations on the detection rate of the LAMP assays were also investigated and compared with that of IS 2404 PCR, a reference assay for the detection of M. ulcerans. Thirty clinical specimens from suspected BU cases were examined by LAMP and IS 2404 PCR. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The lower detection limit of both LAMP methods at 60 °C was 300 copies of IS 2404 and 30 copies of IS 2404 for the conventional LAMP at 65 °C. When purified DNA extracts were used, both the conventional LAMP and IS 2404 PCR concordantly detected 21 positive cases, while the pocket warmer LAMP detected 19 cases.

In this study, specificity and sensitivity of LAMP method was evaluated for the detection of T. annulata in acute infected and/or carriers cattle using primer pair specifically designed to amplify merozoite surface antigen gene (Mero 1), 30 kDa major merozoite surface antigen gene (Tams- 1) and cytochrome b gene of T. annulata. Primer pairs with highest sensitivity were used to evaluate the applicability of <b>LAMP</b> to the <b>field</b> samples. Two <b>LAMP</b> primers (CYTOB 1 and CYTOB 341) targeting cytochrome b gene specifically amplified DNA of different T. annulata isolates successfully while no amplification was seen in other species DNAs and BL 20.
