5|$|In mid-September, {{the press}} {{announced}} that on 8 May 1996 NSB had agreed that Class 71's axles could receive a steel quality substandard to European standard and recommendation from the International Union of Railways. The {{reason was that}} the class would have a much higher weight than planned, and that this would cause the trains to operate more slowly and thus {{not be able to}} reach the airport in the desired 19 minutes. Class 73 inherited the same axle quality from the Class 71 order. On 11 September, Adtranz accepted responsibility for the axle problems, and stated that they would replace all axles free of charge, an operation which would cost them NOK70 million. In October, Adtranz announced that they would also replace all the wheels on both classes. NSB was spending NOK1.5 million on brake discs and <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> per month. The parties continued to disagree on the size of compensation Adtranz should give NSB, with NOK100 million separating the two. In July, NSB replaced DNV with CorrOcean as their inspection supplier for the class. NSB stated that this halved the cost of the inspections. The same month, Bombardier Transportation, who by then had taken over Adtranz, stated {{that they were going to}} replace the bogie frames for all the Class 71 and 73, as well as Class 93 trains, as part of the compensation deal with NSB.|$|E

25|$|Before about 1960, most railway {{vehicles}} used <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> to {{stop the}} train by applying pressure on the wheel treads. Since then, disc brakes have increasingly been used, which means that cleaning the compressed leaf material from the wheel tread by abrasion no longer occurs.|$|E

In particular, the forces from the <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> and the free or dead lever must meet the actual braking leverage. In addition, the <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> force can be decomposed into the contact force and the friction force.|$|R

25|$|Natural {{amorphous}} {{and fine}} flake graphite {{are used in}} brake linings or <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> for heavier (nonautomotive) vehicles, and became important {{with the need to}} substitute for asbestos. This use has been important for quite some time, but nonasbestos organic (NAO) compositions are beginning to reduce graphite's market share. A brake-lining industry shake-out with some plant closures has not been beneficial, nor has an indifferent automotive market. According to the USGS, US natural graphite consumption in brake linings was 6,510 tonnes in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The R22s were {{fitted with}} {{different}} types of <b>brake</b> <b>shoes,</b> to see which one would negotiate the rail joints better. It was eventually found that the automated trip took 10 seconds longer than manual operation (about 95 seconds, compared to 85 seconds). As the tests on the Sea Beach line progressed, grade time stops were added to ensure safety on the line, and on the 42nd Street line. The train was dubbed SAM, and was to operate on Track 4 of the shuttle line.|$|E

50|$|The wheel {{cylinder}} {{consists of a}} cylinder that has two pistons, one on each side. Each piston has a rubber seal and a shaft that connects the piston with a <b>brake</b> <b>shoe.</b> When <b>brake</b> pressure is applied, the pistons are forced out pushing the shoes {{into contact with the}} drum.

25|$|Automobile brakes {{inherently}} rely on friction, slowing {{a vehicle}} by converting its kinetic energy into heat. Incidentally, dispersing this {{large amount of}} heat safely is one technical challenge in designing brake systems. Disk brakes rely on friction between a disc and brake pads that are squeezed transversely against the rotating disc. In Drum brakes, <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> or pads are pressed outwards against a rotating cylinder (brake drum) to create friction. Since braking discs can be more efficiently cooled than drums, disc brakes have better stopping performance.|$|E
25|$|Formaldehyde is {{a common}} {{precursor}} to more complex compounds and materials. In approximate order of decreasing consumption, products generated from formaldehyde include urea formaldehyde resin, melamine resin, phenol formaldehyde resin, polyoxymethylene plastics, 1,4-butanediol, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate. The textile industry uses formaldehyde-based resins as finishers to make fabrics crease-resistant. Formaldehyde-based materials are key to the manufacture of automobiles, and used to make components for the transmission, electrical system, engine block, door panels, axles and <b>brake</b> <b>shoes.</b> The value of sales of formaldehyde and derivative products was over $145 billion in 2003, about 1.2% {{of the gross domestic}} product (GDP) of the United States and Canada.

25|$|In {{addition}} to air brake systems, all locomotives and rail cars {{are equipped with}} at least one hand brake. This is a mechanical device that applies <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> to the wheels to prevent them from moving. The effectiveness of hand brakes depends on several factors, including their age, their maintained condition, their application in conjunction with air brakes, and the force exerted by the person applying the brake, which can vary widely. The TSB estimated that somewhere between 17 and 26 hand brakes would have been needed to secure the train. Which if {{there would have been a}} two-man crew the crew would have been able to perform a stabilization test, which is all air brakes released and ensuring just the hand brakes will hold the train. Since there was only a one-man crew this test was not possible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work, a {{friction}} composite material {{which will be}} used for material of train <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> was investigated to study the effect of ingredients on flexural strength. The Taguchi method is used to measure relative effect of ingredients on flexural strength of composite. Taguchi L 8 orthogonal array which consists of 7 factors with 2 levels each is applied to perform experiment. Ingredients of friction composite were considered as factors or parameters and % volume for each factor was varied at 2 levels. Phenolic resin and barite (BaSO 4) were not included as factor. Phenolic resin was always kept constant at 30 % volume and % volume of barite (BaSO 4) was varied to compensate the changing of other ingredients amount.

25|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted parking brakes. Power assisted parking brakes are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional parking brakes, but pulling the lever operates a valve that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> and makes applying the parking brake easier. When releasing the parking brake, the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the parking brake when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off.|$|E
25|$|Power {{operated}} parking brakes are {{fitted to}} heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These are usually spring applied, with air pressure {{being used to}} hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the parking brake cylinders to release the parking brake, or release the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the parking brake being released if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system {{is that if a}} vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the parking brake to be released, or the <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|E
25|$|The contractor's {{locomotive}} {{was a small}} tank locomotive specially {{adapted for}} use by civil engineering contractor firms engaged {{in the building of}} railways. The locomotives would be used for hauling men, equipment and building materials over temporary railway networks built at the worksite that were frequently re-laid or taken up and moved elsewhere as building work progressed. Contractor's locomotives were usually saddle or well tank types (see above) but required several adaptations to make them suitable for their task. They were built to be as light as possible so they could run over the lightly built temporary rails and had deeply flanged wheels so they did not de-rail on the tracks which were often very uneven. At the same time they had to be very powerful with good traction as they would often have to haul trains of wagons up very steep gradients, such as the sides of railway embankments or spoil heaps. Many were designed so that large iron ballast blocks could be fitted to the frames when extra weight and traction was required, then removed when it was not. Most had sanding gear fitted to all wheels for maximum traction. Some method of keeping mud and dust from clogging the wheels and <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> was also required – this either took the form of scraper bars fitted to {{the leading edge of the}} wheels or wheel washer jets supplied from the water tank. To handle long trains of loose-coupled (and often un-sprung) wagons, contractor's locomotives usually had very effective steam-powered brakes. Most lacked a full cab, often only having a front 'spectacle plate'. If a cab was provided it was usually removable along with the chimney, and sometimes the dome, so that the locomotive could be loaded onto a flatbed wagon for transport to new locations by rail whilst remaining within the loading gauge.|$|E

2500|$|Due {{to a wider}} {{possible}} {{distance between}} the mounts and pads, cantilever brakes are often preferred for bicycles that use wide tyres, such as on mountain bikes. Because the arms move only in their designed arcs, the brake shoe must be adjustable in several planes. [...] Thus cantilever <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> are notoriously difficult to adjust. As the <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> of a second-class cantilever brake wears, they ride lower on the rim. Eventually, one may go underneath the rim, so that the brake does not function.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study train curving performances, 1 D and 3 D train {{dynamics}} models were built by numerical method. The 1 D model {{was composed of}} 210 simple wagons allowed of only longitudinal motions, while the 3 D train model included three complicated wagons of which longitudinal, lateral and vertical DOF could be considered. Combined with calculated results under braking condition from 1 D model, behaviours of draft gear and <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> could be added into 3 D model. The assessment of train curving performance is more focused on making a comparison between idling and braking conditions. Some results indicate as follows: When train braking is operated on a curved track, wheel-rail lateral force and derailment factor are larger than those under idling condition. Because yawing movement of wheelset is limited by <b>brake</b> <b>shoe,</b> the zone of wheel contact along wheel tread is wider than that under idling condition.

2500|$|In the air brake's {{simplest}} form, {{called the}} straight air system, compressed air pushes on a piston in a cylinder. The piston is connected through mechanical linkage to <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> that can rub {{on the train}} wheels, using the resulting friction to slow the train.

2500|$|The {{caliper brake}} is {{a class of}} cable-actuated brake in which the brake mounts to a single point above the wheel, {{theoretically}} allowing the arms to auto-centre on the rim.
