40|$|The current {{operation}} strategy for using Saltstone Vault 4 to receive 0. 2 Ci/gallon salt solution waste involves pouring a clean grout layer over the radioactive grout prior to initiating pour into another cell. This will minimize the radiating surface area {{and reduce the}} dose rate at the vault and surrounding area. The Clean Cap {{will be used to}} shield about four feet of Saltstone poured into a Z-Area vault cell prior to moving to another cell. The minimum thickness of the Clean Cap layer will be determined by the cesium concentration and resulting dose levels and it is expected to be about one foot thick based on current calculations for 0. 1 Ci Saltstone that is produced in the Saltstone process by stabilization of 0. 2 Ci salt solution. This report documents experiments performed to identify a formulation for the Clean Cap. Thermal transient calculations, adiabatic temperature rise measurements, pour height, time between pour calculations and shielding calculations were beyond the scope and time limitations of this study. However, data required for shielding calculations (composition and specific gravity) are provided for shielding calculations. The approach used to design a Clean Cap formulation was to produce a slurry from the reference premix (10 / 45 / 45 weight percent cement/slag/fly ash) and domestic water that resembled as closely as possible the properties of the Saltstone slurry. In addition, options were investigated that may offer advantages such as less <b>bleed</b> <b>water</b> and less heat generation. The options with less <b>bleed</b> <b>water</b> required addition of dispersants. The options with lower heat contained more fly ash and less slag. A mix containing 10 / 45 / 45 weight percent cement/slag/fly ash with a water to premix ratio of 0. 60 is recommended for the Clean Cap. Although this mix may generate more than 3 volume percent standing water (<b>bleed</b> <b>water),</b> it has rheological, mixing and flow properties that are similar to previously processed Saltstone. The recommended Clean Cap mix generates more <b>bleed</b> <b>water</b> than the reference Saltstone formulation because the specific gravity of water, the carrier fluid, is less than that of the carrier fluid in Saltstone, 1 versus 1. 1 to 1. 2, respectively. In addition, the development of slurry structure as a result of hydration reactions is slightly slower than in the salt solution slurry. In other words, the Clean Cap mix has a slightly longer gel time. The lower density of the carrier fluid and the slower development of slurry structure, enable more settling to occur (more standing water) in the Clean Cap slurry. Consequently, for the same rheological properties, the Clean Cap slurry will have more <b>bleed</b> <b>water.</b> In an attempt to reduce the <b>bleed</b> <b>water,</b> the water to premix ratio was lowered and dispersants (high range water reducers) were added. Below water to premix ratios of 0. 35, little <b>bleed</b> <b>water</b> and settling was observed. However, a low water to premix Clean Cap mix is not recommended because processing has not been demonstrated in the Saltstone facility. The lowest water to premix ratio processed in Z-Area was 0. 478 in the last attempt to produce a clean cap. Although this option may provide significant advantages (less <b>bleed</b> <b>water</b> and potentially better flow) process testing in the Saltstone Facility or in a pilot scale facility in conjunction with laboratory testing will be required to demonstrate mixing, pumping and flow properties. Other additives were tested to minimize <b>bleed</b> <b>water.</b> These additives were found to be unsatisfactory in one or more ways and therefore, were not recommended at this time. An air entraining agent and a thickener had some benefit in reducing <b>bleed</b> <b>water</b> but were found too difficult to implement as an additive in the Saltstone facility.

40|$|Severe {{corrosion}} {{distress and}} failures in post-tensioned tendons {{has been found}} in two major bridges in the State of Florida. Corrosion distress and complete tendon failure has been identified in horizontally oriented tendons that support pre-cast bridge superstructure box segments. In virtually all instances, the observed corrosion has been associated with the presence of grout voids and visual evidence of grout <b>bleed</b> <b>water</b> having been present for indeterminate periods of time. With few exceptions, corrosion induced strand failures have occurred in the immediate vicinity of the anchorage. The anchorage systems in both bridges utilize a proprietary multi-plane anchorage (housing) comprised of ductile cast iron and forged steel wedge plate. The presence of these metals coupled with high strength strands gives rise to concerns relative to galvanic corrosion thus prompting this preliminary investigation focusing on dissimilar metals corrosion. The investigation involves laboratory tests that examine the corrosion aspects of grout <b>bleed</b> <b>water</b> and re-charge water in contact with dissimilar metals comprising the tendon and anchorage system. The preliminary results indicate that the high strength post-tensioned strands are mostly anodic to the anchorage system when exposed to either grout <b>bleed</b> <b>water</b> or recharge water such as that which may be experienced through leakage.

Because the amount and types of organics introduced through the CSSX process do not significantly impact the fresh properties of Saltstone, the ''quantity of organics'' variable will not be included in the Saltstone Variability Study. The Saltstone Variability Study should include the variable of ''mix temperature'' in the experimental design. Examples are presented in this report that clearly demonstrate a pronounced dependence of the fresh grout properties on ''mix temperature''. One example, using mixes made with the Deliquification, Dissolution and Adjustment (DDA) simulant, shows that the properties of gel time and <b>bleed</b> <b>water</b> are highly mix temperature dependent. The gel time increased from 15 minutes at 10 C to 90 minutes at 35 C with most of the change occurring between 20 and 30 C. That is, gel time is highly sensitive to mix temperature, especially in the temperature range over which processing is most likely. The volume percent <b>bleed</b> <b>water</b> for these mixes increased from {approx} 1 % at 10 C to 13 % at 35 C. The gel times and volume percent <b>bleed</b> <b>water</b> are correlated such that the longer the gel time, the greater the amount of <b>bleed</b> <b>water.</b> In another example, and in contrast to the DDA results, gel times decreased with increasing temperatures for mixes made using the Modular CSSX Unit (MCU) simulants.

The plastic viscosity increased from 35 cP at 40 C to values between 60 to 70 cP at 10 C for these mixes. Yield stress values for these mixes increased slightly with increasing temperature. The properties of yield stress and plastic viscosity are important parameters because they are related to pumping of these slurries through the pipeline to the vault and the flow of the grout in the vaults...|$|E

So, some of them are to be described in the following. (1) Favorable effects of using commercial-made corrosion inhibitors on concrete strength were observed in the experiments. (2) The effects of salt contents in concrete on the 28 th-day concrete strength were somewhat complex phenomenon. On the average adding salt into concrete caused a little lower strengths, there observed the minimum strength at the concentration of NaCl in concrete between 0. 03 % and 0. 15 %, then increasing tendency of strength could be seen until salt content increased to 0. 25 % which corresponded to the concentration of NaCl in sea-water mixing concrete. Thereafter the more NaCl concentration in the concrete, lower the strength ensured. (3) The effect of salt dosage in concrete mixing on slump value was small. But tendency that larger concentration caused less slump was observed.

40|$|The Wisconsin Department of Transportation WISDOT) has {{sponsored}} investigations on {{the causes of}} freeze-thaw scaling damage on Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) roadways within the state that are coated with membrane forming curing compounds (MFCCs). Several studies have identified excess <b>bleed</b> <b>water</b> {{at the time of}} curing compound application as a potential cause of reduced scaling resistance of concrete pavements. Increasing the delay between concrete finishing steps and MFC application should serve to lessen scaling damage. However, there is currently no literature that sought to quantify a possible linkage between MFCC application time and the scaling resistance. The primary goal of this research was to evaluate the influence of MFCC application time on the freeze-thaw scaling damage resistance of roadway concrete made with materials native to Wisconsin. A factorial experiment was designed to probe the effect of MFCC application time on scaling damage as measured by ASTM C 672. Three emulsion-based curing compounds, Linseed Oil, Wax, and Poly-alpha-methyl-styrene (PAMS) were evaluated at three application times on concrete specimens prepared with one of two sources of coarse aggregate and one of three cementitious materials. An Acrylic solvent-based sealing compound was evaluated at two application times with respect to concrete scaling resistance. Untreated specimens from each mix type were cured in a wet room and tested as controls. A secondary goal of this project was to evaluate a new method for determining the presence of <b>bleed</b> <b>water</b> on a concrete surface by constructing a device to detect changes in the relative humidity of the air above the concrete surface over time to more reliably determine the cessation of the bleeding than current methods. To achieve this goal, a device was built and its operational capability was tested during the study. ii Concrete mixes were designed and specimens were prepared according to WISDOT procedures to provide a good representation of the pavements within Wisconsin. Freeze-thaw scaling damage testing was performed on all specimens and data was recorded following the appropriate testing standard. Properties such as fresh concrete slump, air content, 28 -day compressive strength, and curing compound application rates were measured and recorded to ensure compliance with WISDOT standards. Results in this study indicate that the influence of MFCC application time on the scaling resistance of concrete is dependent upon the compound chosen. The Linseed Oil and Acrylic formulations displayed significantly increased scaling resistance with an increase in application time. The Wax and PAMS formulations did not display significant increases in scaling resistance with an increase in application time. Results from the untreated wet room cured specimens indicate that curing compounds do not promote scaling resistance levels that compare favorably to the humidity control method wet room curing. Scaling resistance was also found to be dependent upon composition of the concrete, especially with respect to the coarse aggregate and cementitious material choice. Elevated levels of ambient relative humidity at the time of specimen manufacture appeared to decrease the scaling resistance, regardless of application time. The device was found not to be reliable for monitoring the presence of <b>bleed</b> <b>water</b> in its current design. Analysis of the data collected by the device showed that future modifications could be made improve its operational capability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the early-age properties of cementbased materials, from a materials science perspective. The major physical and chemical processes occurring at early ages are reviewed and strategies for mitigating early-age cracking are presented. 1. Settling, <b>Bleeding,</b> and Evaporative <b>Water</b> Loss during Early Age Curing/Drying Immediately after placement, gravitational forces and the local drying environment begin to influence the (micro) structure of a cement paste, mortar, or concrete. Depending on the mixture’s water-to-cementitious materials mass ratio (w/cm) (and aggregate volume fraction), the initial freshly cast material may be thought of either as a concentrated suspension of rigid particles in water or as a granular water-filled porous media. In the former case, significant settling will be expected to occur, accompanied by bleeding. For present-day portland cement pastes without admixture additions, for example, measurable bleeding an...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Use of {{recycled}} concrete aggregate (RCA) is getting importance as it minimizes {{the use of}} fresh materials and eliminates waste disposal. One of the uses of RCA is as aggregate in Controlled Low Strength Material (CLSM). This paper reports {{the results of the}} investigation done on the use of RCA in CLSM. Various mixtures of CLSM were made using RCA, fly ash, and cement. Tests for workability, <b>bleeding,</b> density, strength, <b>water</b> absorption, sorption, and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) were conducted. Results show that the compressive strength ranged from 1. 71 MPa to 4. 92 MPa, fresh density from 1879 kg/m 3 to 1998 kg/m 3. The strength of CLSM increases with the increase in fly ash; <b>water</b> absorption and <b>bleeding</b> decrease with increase in fly ash. It is concluded that the RCA has potential to be used in CLSM and the addition of fly ash enhances the performance...|$|R
