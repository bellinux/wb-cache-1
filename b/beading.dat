5|$|The skull {{has a long}} rostrum (front part), broad interorbital region (between the eyes), and low braincase. It {{differs from}} that of T.bolivaris in various proportions, which are more {{apparent}} in adults than in juveniles. The skull of H.megacephalus is distinctly larger. The zygomatic plate is broad and includes a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. Its back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The zygomatic arch (cheekbone) is heavy. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend about as far backward. The interorbital region is narrowest toward the front and shows weak <b>beading</b> at its margins; T.bolivaris is similar, but has stronger <b>beading</b> and H.megacephalus entirely lacks the <b>beading.</b> The parietal bone is usually limited to the roof of the braincase and does not extend to its side, as it does in most T.bolivaris. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is large.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{flattened}} {{in general}} shape. The front part {{is short and}} broad. The broad interorbital region (located between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped, with squared edges and weakly developed <b>beading.</b> A postorbital ridge is present, obscuring the suture (joint) between the frontal and squamosal bones, a feature shared only with Holochilus among oryzomyines. The braincase is squarish. The interparietal bone is wide, but does not reach the squamosals on the sides. The zygomatic arches, which are well-developed, are furthest apart at the back and converge toward the front. The jugal bone is small.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) {{is large}} and robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic plate is narrow and lacks a zygomatic notch, an extension of the plate at the front. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The narrowest part of the interorbital region, located between the eyes, is to the front and its margins exhibit strong <b>beading.</b> Various crests develop on the long braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} <b>beads</b> varies by {{religion}} or use. Islamic prayer <b>beads,</b> called Misbaha or Tasbih, usually have 99 or 33 <b>beads.</b> Buddhists and Hindus use the Japa Mala, which usually has 108 <b>beads,</b> or 27 which are counted four times. Baha'i prayer <b>beads</b> consist of either 95 <b>beads</b> or 19 <b>beads,</b> which are strung {{with the addition}} of five <b>beads</b> below. The Sikh Mala also has 108 <b>beads.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Bead</b> {{embroidery}} is an embellishment {{that does}} not form {{an essential part of}} a textile's structure. In this respect, <b>bead</b> embroidery differs from <b>bead</b> weaving, <b>bead</b> crochet, and <b>bead</b> knitting. Woven, knitted, and crocheted <b>beads</b> may be attached during fabric production, whereas embroidered <b>beads</b> are always added upon finished fabric.|$|R
50|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of immunoprecipitations are performed with agarose <b>beads,</b> the use of superparamagnetic <b>beads</b> for immunoprecipitation is a much newer approach that is only recently gaining in popularity as an alternative to agarose <b>beads</b> for IP applications. Unlike agarose, magnetic <b>beads</b> are solid and can be spherical, {{depending on the type of}} <b>bead,</b> and antibody binding is limited to the surface of each <b>bead.</b> While these <b>beads</b> do not have the advantage of a porous center to increase the binding capacity, magnetic <b>beads</b> are significantly smaller than agarose <b>beads</b> (1 to 4μm), and the greater number of magnetic <b>beads</b> per volume than agarose <b>beads</b> collectively gives magnetic <b>beads</b> an effective surface area-to-volume ratio for optimum antibody binding.|$|R
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{long and}} robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic notch, an extension at the front of the zygomatic plate, is present. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. A strong jugal bone is present in the zygomatic arch (cheekbone), so that the maxillary and squamosal bones, which form the front and back parts of the arch, respectively, do not overlap when seen from the side. The narrowest part of the interorbital region (located between the eyes) is to the front and the region's margins exhibit strong <b>beading.</b> Various crests develop on the rounded braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone at the back of the braincase is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and occipital bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:00, {{the runway}} at Khâm Đức was cleared of the wrecked helicopter. Moments later, a C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Daryl D. Cole touched {{down on the}} runway under heavy fire, which flattened one tire and caused extensive damage to the wing tanks. Almost immediately, Cole's aircraft was rushed by hysterical Vietnamese civilians from ditches along the runway, filling the aircraft so the loadmaster was prevented from unloading the aircraft's cargo. Under heavy fire, Cole decided to navigate his aircraft down the cratered and shrapnel-littered runway, {{in order to take}} off. However, the combined weight of the cargo and civilians, in addition to the damage sustained during landing, prevented the aircraft from gathering enough speed to take off. So the aircrew aborted the take off, offloaded the civilians, and proceeded to cut off the blown tire to stop it from flapping and slowing down the aircraft. They were able to cut off the rubber with the bayonet, and were able to cut through the steel <b>beading</b> thanks to the engineers carefully cutting the steel cords with a blowtorch. A fire extinguisher was kept handy because of fear of catching the magnesium wheel on fire. About two hours later, realizing that enemy artillery rounds were coming closer to his aircraft, Colonel Cole tried to take off for the second time, and managed to get the C-130 into the air. This time his only passengers were three members of Air Force Combat Control Team (CCT), whose radio equipment had been destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Bead {{lightning}} is the decaying {{stage of}} a lightning channel in which the luminosity of the channel breaks up into segments. Nearly every lightning discharge will exhibit <b>beading</b> as the channel cools immediately after a return stroke, {{sometimes referred to as}} the lightning's 'bead-out' stage. 'Bead lightning' is more properly a {{stage of a}} normal lightning discharge rather than a type of lightning in itself. <b>Beading</b> of a lightning channel is usually a small-scale feature, and therefore is often only apparent when the observer/camera is close to the lightning.|$|E

40|$|Eight {{experimental}} <b>bead</b> {{types in}} addition to Kentucky's currently used <b>bead</b> were applied with standard striping equipment at a field test location. Reflectivity measurements using a portable retroreflectometer were conducted, along with visual observations, to rate each <b>bead</b> type.

The differences in <b>bead</b> types involved gradation, refractive index, and surface coating. Based on performance and economic considerations, it was recom-mended that Kentucky change its <b>bead</b> gradation specifications to correspond to that for the fine-gradation <b>bead</b> used in this study. The <b>bead</b> type termed "fine-gradation " in this study did not involve an unusally finely graded <b>bead.</b> It was considered a fine-gradation <b>bead</b> in comparison to Kentucky's c�rrently used <b>bead</b> which has a higher percentage of large <b>beads</b> (<b>beads</b> retained on the No. 30 sieve).

25|$|On all coins, the <b>beading</b> (ring {{of small}} dots) {{around the edge}} of the obverses has been removed. The obverse of the 20p coin has also been amended to {{incorporate}} the year, which had been on the reverse of the coin since its introduction in 1982 (giving rise to an unusual issue of a mule version without any date at all). The orientation of both sides of the 50p coin has been rotated through 180 degrees, meaning the bottom of the coin is now a corner rather than a flat edge. The numerals showing the decimal value of each coin, previously present on all coins except £2 and £1, have been removed, leaving the values spelled out in words only.|$|E
25|$|In spring, {{our women}} {{harvested}} the supple, young shoots to make baskets. Our men fashioned the wood into pipe stems, emergency snowshoes, snares, wooden nails, whistles for the children, <b>beading</b> looms, and frames for stretching hides. Rotted willow wood {{was used to}} smoke hides. Green willow branches were burned to smoke meat. We twisted the inner bark fibers into temporary rope, twine and fish nets. We weather proofed rawhide by wrapping it in willow bark. We used willow branches as lathing for our houses. Our men scraped off the inner cambium layer and added other ingredients, such as bearberry, to make a smoking mixture, ‘Kinnikinick’. We repaired our carts, made a shelter when we were caught in a storm, burned for fuel and had {{a variety of other}} practical uses for the wood of the willow.|$|E

25|$|Despite that it {{was unusual}} for women to {{participate}} in archaeology at the time, in 1901, encouraged by Howard Carter, Lady William Cecil began excavations at Qubbet el-Hawa near Aswan. Her family was wintering {{in the area and}} while exploring on {{the west bank of the}} Nile had discovered what she thought might be an ancient cemetery. Carter, who in 1899 had been appointed by the Antiquities Service as one of two European Chief Inspectors and in charge of excavations in the Nile Valley south from Qus to the Sudanese border, came to see the find the following day. He arranged for permits to excavate and provided an inspector and workers to assist in the dig. She kept a diary of the details of the expedition in which multiple tombs were found, as well as wooden anthropoid coffins of the Saite Era. Though the entire necropolis was infested with termites, Tomb 21 yielded two burial boxes. The male's coffin disintegrated when it was touched, but the female's coffin remained intact and was removed. The exterior was painted in yellow and devoid of any inscription. The mummy was covered with a blue network of <b>beading.</b> A coarse blue glaze was used on the winged scarabs and Amenti gods depicted on the canopic jars. The sole adornment of the mummy was a one inch by half inch opaque green stone. Lady William's diary recorded that the names found in the tomb were Bao-bao, daughter of Pawebas and Shepentanefet and her brother Waher. She also reported remnants of a former burial, which may have been the tomb of Shepentanefret.|$|E

50|$|Glass <b>beads</b> {{are usually}} {{categorized}} by {{the method used}} to manipulate the glass - wound <b>beads,</b> drawn <b>beads,</b> and molded <b>beads.</b> There are composites, such as millefiori <b>beads,</b> where cross-sections of a drawn glass cane are applied to a wound glass core. A very minor industry in blown glass <b>beads</b> also existed in 19th-century Venice and France.|$|R
50|$|Trade <b>beads</b> (sometimes called aggry and slave <b>beads)</b> were {{otherwise}} decorative glass <b>beads</b> used {{between the}} 16th and 20th {{century as a}} token money to exchange for goods, services and slaves (hence the name). Trade <b>beads</b> were used to exploit African resources by early Europeans. This included African slave trade. The <b>beads</b> were integrated in Native American jewelry using various beadwork techniques. Aggry <b>beads</b> are {{a particular type of}} decorated glass <b>bead</b> from Ghana.|$|R

The provision of lavatories on these coaches appears to have been an afterthought. There were three doors on one side but only two on the other; a single lavatory had been squeezed into the vestibule where the missing door would have been. Despite their modern appearance, their bus type seats were not popular with passengers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technology}} for glass beadmaking {{is among the}} oldest human arts, dating back 3,000 years (Dubin, 1987). Glass <b>beads</b> have been dated back to at least Roman times. Perhaps the earliest glass-like <b>beads</b> were Egyptian faience <b>beads,</b> a form of clay <b>bead</b> with a self-forming vitreous coating. Glass <b>beads</b> are significant in archaeology because the presence of glass <b>beads</b> often indicate that there was trade and that the beadmaking technology was being spread.
