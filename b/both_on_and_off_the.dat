5|$|In {{addition}} to proximity and competitiveness, the rivalry {{was fueled by}} controversial incidents <b>both</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field. Maryland supporters long held that Navy players used unnecessary roughness during play, a charge counter-accused by the Academy after the 1963 game. Some Midshipmen would travel to College Park to meet female students, which served to aggravate the ill feelings. Pranks and vandalism were commonplace on both campuses and exacerbated the already tense situation between Maryland and Navy.|$|E
5|$|The Crab Bowl Classic, {{also known}} as the Crab Bowl or the Maryland–Navy rivalry, is an American college {{football}} rivalry between the Maryland Terrapins football team of the University of Maryland and the Navy Midshipmen football team of the United States Naval Academy. The two institutions, located in close proximity in the state of Maryland, first met for a football game in 1905. Since then, the series has often been marked by controversy, with incidents by players and supporters occurring <b>both</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field.

5|$|Coming {{into the}} Gator Bowl, the Virginia Tech defense was ranked first in total defense, second in pass defense, fourth in rushing defense, {{and third in}} scoring defense, {{allowing}} an average of just over 12points per game. The Virginia Tech defense was led by defensive end Darryl Tapp, a first-team All-ACC pick, an American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) All-American, {{a finalist for the}} Lott Trophy, and a finalist for the Ted Hendricks Award. Tapp was considered a natural leader <b>both</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field and led the Hokies' defensive workouts during practice. Tapp finished the regular season with 45tackles (including 12.5 for a loss) and ten sacks.

He became the first yokozuna in history to be suspended from competition in August 2007 when he participated in a charity soccer match in his home country despite having withdrawn from a regional sumo tour claiming injury. After a career filled with a multitude of other controversies, <b>both</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> dohyō, his career was cut short when he retired from sumo in February 2010 after allegations that he assaulted a man outside a Tokyo nightclub.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez {{became the}} first elected {{president}} of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 {{and the end of}} Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability <b>both</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such world-class players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.|$|E
5|$|The {{club has}} seen its share of struggles, <b>both</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ice. The team has had two changes of ownership, from Firestone to Rod Bryden in 1993 due to the arena {{development}} process and its financing, and subsequently to Eugene Melnyk after the team filed for bankruptcy in 2003. On the ice, the club finished last in the League in its first four seasons. Changes in hockey management have led to steady improvement of the team's play, resulting in the team qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs in 11 of the last 12 seasons, winning the Presidents' Trophy in 2002–03 and {{making it to the}} Stanley Cup Finals in 2007.|$|E

5|$|During {{the next}} season under new manager Carlo Ancelotti, Del Piero {{primarily}} served as an assist-man, providing 14 assists in Serie A, {{the most in the}} league that season, and 20 in all competitions. He faced criticism, however, for his inability to score in open play following his injury the previous season, as only one of his 9 Serie A goals that season was in open play (a header against Parma), with the rest coming from penalties. Furthermore, {{towards the end of the}} season, his once excellent attacking partnership with Inzaghi became less effective, due to Inzaghi's individualism, as well as the pair's lack of understanding and strained relationship <b>both</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pitch. Del Piero helped Juventus to capture the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup that season, which allowed Juventus to qualify for the UEFA Cup; overall, he scored 12 goals in all competitions, as Juventus narrowly missed out on the Serie A title. In 2000, Del Piero was the world's best-paid football player from salaries, bonuses, and advertising revenue.|$|E
5|$|Local white {{residents}} of the area objected almost immediately. They complained about black MPs challenging white people and patrolling the town while brandishing their military weapons. The first commanding officer, Major James Ellison, was supportive of his MPs; however, he was soon relieved of his command. A segregationist colonel replaced Ellison, and enforced segregation <b>both</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> base. This prompted black newspapers to protest his assignment. The colonel was transferred with a promotion, and Noel Parrish then took command as 'director of training'. The lack of assignments according to background and training led to an excess of non-aviation black officers without a mission. This became disparaging to morale, as the facility became overcrowded. As there was little {{in the line of}} recreation, Parrish began to arrange for celebrities to visit and perform at the base. Lena Horne, Joe Louis, Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Robinson, Louis Armstrong, and Langston Hughes were among the many guests. Parrish also desegregated the base to a much larger extent than his predecessors.|$|E

Her achievements included being the first player in LPGA history to win a major three consecutive years at the LPGA Championship and the first golfer in LPGA or PGA history to win the same event five consecutive years at the Mizuno Classic. 11 wins in 21 tournaments entered worldwide included victory in the Scandinavian TPC hosted by Annika where she presented herself the trophy, giving her an eighth Money List title, tying the LPGA record, an eighth Rolex Player of the Year (POY) award (a record) and a sixth Vare Trophy. She is the only LPGA player ever to win Money List, POY award and Vare trophy in the same year in five different years. Team competition saw her make her seventh consecutive Solheim Cup appearance, her 4 points making her total 21, the event's all-time leading points earner, and the inaugural Lexus Cup was played with Sörenstam as the Captain of the victorious International Team.|$|E

5|$|The Hoops' defeat to Shelbourne in {{the first}} round of the FAI Cup in 1970, their first defeat in 32 Cup games over seven years, marked the start of the decline in the {{fortunes}} of the club. Despite only narrowly missing out on the League title in the 1970–71 season in controversial circumstances, the next twelve years proved to be a disaster for the club <b>both</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field. On 25 April 1971, Rovers met Cork Hibs in Dalymount in a League play-off watched by 28,000 people. Their pre-match buildup was thrown into disarray when players and directors clashed over win bonuses. Hibs won the play-off 3–1. The next season, the Cunninghams, now under the control of sons Arthur and Des, sold the club to three brothers from Dublin; Paddy, Barton and Louis Kilcoyne. The Kilcoynes had witnessed decades of huge attendances at Irish football games and sought to take over the club primarily for business reasons. However, within the space of five years, the large crowds disappeared from Irish football stadia and combined with the demise of Drumcondra and Cork Hibs, the decline in fortunes of a number of top clubs and the lack of action by the FAI, the League of Ireland was plunged into a drastic decline.|$|E
5|$|Businessman Clifford Coombs {{took over}} as {{chairman}} in 1965, luring Stan Cullis out of retirement to manage the club. Cullis's team played attractive football which {{took them to the}} semifinals of the League Cup in 1967 and the FA Cup in 1968, but league football needed a different approach. Successor Freddie Goodwin produced a team playing skilful, aggressive football that won promotion as well as reaching an FA Cup semifinal. Two years later, the club raised money by selling Bob Latchford to Everton for a British record fee of £350,000, but without his goals the team struggled.Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 38–39, 209–15. Sir Alf Ramsey briefly managed the club before Jim Smith took over in 1978. With relegation a certainty, the club sold Trevor Francis to Nottingham Forest, making him the first player transferred for a fee of £1million; Francis had scored a total of 133 goals in 329 appearances over his nine years at Birmingham. Smith took Birmingham straight back to the First Division, but a poor start to the 1981–82 season saw him replaced by Ron Saunders, who had just resigned from league champions Aston Villa. Saunders' team struggled to score goals and in 1984 they were relegated. They bounced back up, but the last home game of the 1984–85 promotion season, against Leeds United, was marred by rioting, culminating in the death of a boy when a wall collapsed on him. This was on the same day as the Bradford City stadium fire, and the events at St Andrew's formed part of the remit of Mr Justice Popplewell's inquiry into safety at sports grounds. The club lacked stability <b>both</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field. Saunders quit after FA Cup defeat to non-League team Altrincham, staff were laid off, the training ground was sold, and by 1989 Birmingham were in the Third Division {{for the first time in}} their history.|$|E
