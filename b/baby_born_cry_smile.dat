5000|$|Michael (Ronit Roy) is {{a dancer}} {{inspired}} by Michael Jackson. One day Michael is fired {{from his job}} and disappointedly leaves the studio. On his way home, he finds a newly <b>born</b> <b>baby</b> <b>crying</b> {{on the side of}} the road. Michael adopts him and names him Munna (Tiger Shroff). Munna, just like Michael, grows up to be an extraordinary dancer and a diehard fan of Michael Jackson. Michael doesn't want Munna to become a dancer and instead insists him to do a proper job. Munna instead visits dance clubs with his gang and challenges their dancers, thereby earning money in the process. Michael gets ill and is admitted to a hospital. When Munna goes to see him, he once again asks him to drop his idea of dancing. Meanwhile the dance clubs in Mumbai have blacklisted Munna and his gang so Munna tries his luck at Delhi.|$|R

50|$|A {{score of}} 10 is uncommon, {{due to the}} {{prevalence}} of transient cyanosis, and does not substantially differ from a score of 9. Transient cyanosis is common, particularly in <b>babies</b> <b>born</b> at high altitude. A study that compared <b>babies</b> <b>born</b> in Peru near sea level with <b>babies</b> <b>born</b> at very high altitude (4340 m) found a significant average difference in the first Apgar score, but not the second. Oxygen saturation (see Pulse oximetry) also was lower at high altitude.|$|R

To assess the rate of HHV- 6 vertical transmission in comparison to CMV, we analyzed cord blood spots dried on cards (Dried Blood Spots, DBS) collected during a multi-center study on HIV congenital infections in Italy. DBS were tested by PCR for HHV- 6 and CMV footprints. HHV- 6 amplimers were sequenced and characterized. As control group, cards taken from <b>babies</b> <b>born</b> to HIV-negative mothers were analyzed. DBS of 187 <b>babies</b> <b>born</b> to HIV-positive and 372 to HIV-negative mothers were analyzed. The prevalence of HHV- 6 was 3. 2 % in <b>babies</b> <b>born</b> to HIV-positive mothers. CMV was found only in the HIV-positive group with a prevalence rate of 1. 6 %. In newborns of control pregnant women, HHV- 6 prevalence rate was 1. 1 % (p= 0. 09), while CMV was not detected (p= 0. 04) ...|$|R
