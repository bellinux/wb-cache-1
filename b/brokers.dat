5|$|Edwards' next {{fraudulent}} scheme involved forging {{letters to}} cotton <b>brokers</b> in New Orleans, {{and using the}} signatures obtained from their replies to forge letters to <b>brokers</b> in New York City, saying that the fake John Caldwell– Edwards' alias– had {{a large amount of}} cotton on deposit with the New Orleans <b>brokers.</b> Edwards used those letters to secure fraudulent loans from <b>brokers</b> on the security of the non-existent cotton. Two New York brokers– Brown Bros. & Co. and Jacob Little– gave Edwards bank drafts for $25,000 each. Edwards then cashed the drafts pretending to be Caldwell, but without attempting to disguise his appearance. Unluckily for Edwards, in September 1841 Brown Brothers was informed by the New Orleans <b>brokers</b> that there was no cotton on account for Caldwell, and this prompted the bankers to offer a reward for information on the forger. The police began to search for the forger of the letters, but were unsuccessful until Edwards attempted to distract their attention to an acquaintance, Alexander Powell, who happened to look much like him. Edwards sent an anonymous letter to the New York police, stating that the forger they were hunting was sailing to England, as Powell was about to do. Edwards assumed that by the time the police acted, Powell's ship would already have sailed. The ship was delayed and the police were able to catch Powell, who told them that Edwards was their forger.|$|E

5|$|Overall {{the play}} was a {{tremendous}} financial success; the previews broke attendance records. In Boston, the show sold out even after the addition of extra matinées. The first week on Broadway took in nearly $ 20,000, close to the maximum the Shubert Theatre could generate at normal prices. However, ticket sales fell off rapidly following the strongly negative reviews. Woods pre-sold four weeks of tickets to local ticket <b>brokers,</b> which helped the box office totals, but the <b>brokers</b> were left with unsold seats even after offering deep discounts. After leaving New York, the show returned to strong sales on the road.|$|E

5|$|As news spread, {{other banks}} and trust {{companies}} {{were reluctant to}} lend any money.

The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust Company. By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City Savings Bank, Hamilton Bank of New York, First National Bank of Brooklyn, International Trust Company of New York, Williamsburg Trust Company of Brooklyn, Borough Bank of Brooklyn, Jenkins Trust Company of Brooklyn and the Union Trust Company of Providence.|$|E

5|$|Linderman {{ordered a}} review {{of the success of the}} trade dollar in China. It was {{discovered}} that the coins circulated reasonably well in southern China, but usage in the north was limited. As the price of silver decreased, employers in the United States began paying workers in trade dollars purchased at a discount. The situation frustrated the public, as the coins were widely disliked and many banks and businesses refused to accept them. In response, many towns, mostly in the western states, set a fixed value on trade dollars. Businesses which did accept trade dollars to avoid offending customers could not deposit them in banks or use them to pay taxes, and sold them to <b>brokers.</b> The <b>brokers</b> in turn recirculated the coins by selling them at a discount from face value to employers who included them in workers' pay packets. In 1883, members of the New York Mercantile Exchange petitioned Congress to allow redemption of the coins by the government.|$|E

5|$|According {{to their}} Confucian ethics, elite and cultured scholar-officials viewed {{themselves}} as the pinnacle members of society (second only to the imperial family). Rural farmers were seen as the essential pillars that provided food for all of society; they were given more respect than the local or regional merchant, no matter how rich and powerful. The Confucian-taught scholar-official elite who ran China's vast bureaucracy viewed their society's growing interest in commercialism {{as a sign of}} moral decay. Nonetheless, Song Chinese urban society was teeming with wholesalers, shippers, storage keepers, <b>brokers,</b> traveling salesmen, retail shopkeepers, peddlers, and many other lowly commercial-based vocations.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{behavior}} of <b>broker</b> quotes in Korean housing markets by comparing the Kookmin Bank apartment (a condominium in a high- rise residential building) price index, a <b>broker</b> quote based apartment price index, and a repeat sales apartment price index that we built using transaction prices, which have become available since January 2006. <b>Broker</b> quotes may differ from actual prices depending on the housing market conditions. Specifically, we test the hypotheses: (1) price increases shown by the <b>broker</b> quote based apartment price index are greater than those shown by the repeat sales apartment price index in an up market; and (2) the <b>broker</b> quote based price index shows a far less price reduction than the repeat sales price index in a down market. We find that indeed in a down market, the <b>broker</b> quote based price index shows far less price reduction than the repeat sales price index (5. 75 %- 8. 07 %). However, the <b>broker</b> quote based price index does not distort the prices in an up market, where trading volumes are high. It appears that the price inflation in the <b>broker</b> quotes rises as the transaction volume drops. While <b>broker</b> quotes are substantially higher than transaction prices in a down market, the <b>broker</b> sentiment, which is a qualitative assessment of market conditions, {{appears to be more}} in line with transaction prices. We have also documented that the <b>broker</b> quote based index reaches its peak about two months after the peak of the repeat sales based index. Finally, <b>broker</b> quotes are smooth in comparison to transaction prices and they are smoothed more in a down market than an up market. Our results suggest that an optimistic view of <b>broker</b> quotes is problematic only in down markets where trading volumes are limited. The price inflation in <b>broker</b> quotes is a risk to the financial system in a market with only a <b>broker</b> quote based index in that it overstates the collateral values underlying mortgage loans in a down market. <b>Broker</b> quotes; <b>Broker</b> quote based apartment price index; Repeat sales apartment price index; House price cycle; <b>Broker</b> sentiment; Korean housing markets...|$|R

5|$|Despite his {{comfortable}} upbringing and {{his high}} social status, Pearson was a radical, and {{throughout his life}} he fought a number of campaigns on progressive and reforming issues including the removal from the Monument inscription blaming the Great Fire of London on Catholics, the abolition of packed special jury lists for political trials, and the overturning of the ban on Jews becoming <b>brokers</b> in the City. Pearson was in favour of the disestablishment of the Church of England and opposed capital punishment.

50|$|A <b>broker</b> is an {{independent}} party, whose services are used extensively in some industries.

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of cloud market mechanism we imagine that if a cloud <b>broker</b> represents a cloud provider, then the cloud <b>broker</b> may provide information which favors that cloud provider; however, if a <b>broker</b> is independent, and its business depends on the trust relations with users, the <b>broker</b> is more motivated to find and provide information being truly helpful for cloud users. This situation may occur when a cloud <b>broker</b> serves as a gateway for {{a large number of}} cloud users in the cloud market. Consistent with the above view, we further imagine that if a cloud <b>broker</b> is highly trusted by some cloud users (especially, end cloud users), the <b>broker</b> may become those cloud users’ trust anchor, taking care of trust management for those cloud users.|$|R
