5|$|Amenhotep I was {{succeeded by}} Thutmose I, {{apparently}} a senior military figure. It is unclear {{if there was}} any <b>blood</b> <b>relationship</b> between the two, although {{it has been suggested that}} Thutmose I was a son of Amenhotep's elder brother Ahmose Sipairi. Amenhotep may have appointed Thutmose I as coregent before his own death as Thutmose I's name appears next to Amenhotep's on a divine barque found by archeologists in the fill of the third pylon at Karnak. However, most scholars consider that this is only evidence of Thutmose associating himself with his royal predecessor. One text has also been interpreted to mean that Amenhotep appointed his infant son as coregent, who then predeceased him. However, the scholarly consensus is that there is too little evidence for either coregency.|$|E

It might also be derived from the Serbian word krv meaning blood, as in linked by <b>blood</b> <b>relationships.</b>|$|R
50|$|For centuries, Baltistan {{consisted}} of small, independent valley states connected by the <b>blood</b> <b>relationships</b> of its rulers (rajas), trade, common beliefs and cultural and linguistic bonds. The states were subjugated by the Dogra rulers of Kashmir during the 19th century. On 29 August 2009 {{the government of}} Pakistan announced the creation of Gilgit-Baltistan, a provincial autonomous region with Gilgit as its capital and Skardu its largest city.|$|R

50|$|The book {{highlights}} {{the degree to}} which family and <b>blood</b> <b>relationships</b> were important in the Middle Ages; the dead man Bonel, his wife's family, his natural son, a host of smallholders in Wales, and the aged Brother Rhys in Shrewsbury Abbey are connected by blood or marriage. The motive for murder was love of the land, the land where he was born, for the son of a Welsh mother.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{a problem of}} {{inferring}} <b>blood</b> <b>relationships</b> which satisfy a given matrix of genetic distances between all pairs of n nodes. <b>Blood</b> <b>relationships</b> are represented by our proposed graph class, which is called a pedigree graph. A pedigree graph is a directed acyclic graph in which the maximum indegree is at most two. We show {{that the number of}} pedigree graphs which satisfy the condition of given genetic distances may be exponential, but they can be represented by one directed acyclic graph with n nodes. Moreover, an O(n 3) time algorithm which solves the problem is also given. Although phylogenetic trees and phylogenetic networks are similar data structures to pedigree graphs, it seems that inferring methods for phylogenetic trees and networks cannot be applied to infer pedigree graphs since nodes of phylogenetic trees and networks represent species whereas nodes of pedigree graphs represent individuals. We also show an O(n 2) time algorithm which detects a contradiction between a given pedigree graph and distance matrix of genetic distances...|$|R
5000|$|The term {{can be a}} {{point of}} confusion, {{especially}} in popular culture and Hollywood, because in the truest sense, crime families are not necessarily blood families {{who happen to be}} involved in criminal activity, and not necessarily based on <b>blood</b> <b>relationships.</b> In Sicily and America, most Mafia bosses are not related to their predecessors. Films like The Godfather and a spate of late-1980s [...] "Mafia princess" [...] television movies underscore this confusion.|$|R
25|$|The Mevlevi {{became a}} {{well-established}} Sufi {{order in the}} Ottoman Empire by realising a <b>blood</b> <b>relationship</b> with the Ottoman sultans when Devlet Hatun, a descendant of Sultan Veled married the sultan Bayezid I. Their son Mehmed I Çelebi became the next sultan, endowing the order, as did his successors, with many gifts.|$|E
25|$|Article IV {{defines the}} {{citizenship}} of Filipinos. It enumerates {{two kinds of}} citizens: natural-born citizens and naturalized citizens. Natural-born citizens {{are those who are}} citizens from birth without having to perform any act to acquire or perfect Philippine citizenship. The Philippines follows a jus sanguinis system where citizenship is mainly acquired through a <b>blood</b> <b>relationship</b> with Filipino citizens.|$|E
25|$|The Umayyads were overthrown in 750 {{by a new}} dynasty, the Abbasids. The first Abbasid caliph, As-Saffah, {{recruited}} Shia {{support in}} his campaign against the Umayyads by emphasising his <b>blood</b> <b>relationship</b> to Muhammad's household through descent from his uncle, ‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib. The Shia also believe that he promised them that the Caliphate, or at least religious authority, would be vested in the Shia Imam. As-Saffah assumed both the temporal and religious mantle of Caliph himself. He continued the Umayyad dynastic practice of succession, and his brother al-Mansur succeeded him in 754.|$|E
40|$|This article, {{taking into}} account the {{functions}} of texts in the Warring States period, analyzes “hou” 後, meaning “successor,” in the Zuozhuan 左傳 and other sources. All of the instances in which the existence of a hou is mentioned in the Zuozhuan are episodes about the dafu 大夫 class (aristocracy), and although a few of the instances referring to the absence of a hou are about monarchs, most of them are about dafu. Most of the hou connected by <b>blood</b> <b>relationships</b> appear in conversational passages and few of them in narrative sections. Because hou are often mentioned in argumentative and conversational passages, it would seem appropriate to infer that arguments about hou evolved later. In the Shijing 詩經, Shangshu 尚書, and some bronze inscriptions, hou refers exclusively to a successor related by blood, and he is expected to conduct ancestral rites. Most of the people referred to as hou in the Zuozhuan are monarchs who come from the stock of the Western Zhou dynasty and people of the dafu class who come from comparatively old clans (shi 氏). On the other hand, the reason for {{the presence or absence of}} a hou is not infrequently associated with ideological terms such as “virtue” (de 德) and so on, and the existence of a hou was not based solely on the principle of <b>blood</b> <b>relationships.</b> After the Spring and Autumn period, prefectures (xian 縣) were established to replace city-states (you 邑), and dafu and lowerranking people were dispatched as administrators from the capital, eventually supporting the rule of the central authorities after the Warring States period. Their positions could not be guaranteed solely by their <b>blood</b> <b>relationships.</b> It could also be said that prefecture-like elements, which later expanded from the Spring and Autumn period to the Warring States period, were inserted into the Zuozhuan...|$|R
30|$|Further, {{analysis}} of financial problems, managerial problems and technology related problems indicates that these {{problems faced by}} women entrepreneurs in finances, managerial skills and technology related is not independent of the variable that ‘kinsfolk has business experience.’ It is observed that there exists a negative relation. This provides scope for exploring the otherwise strong <b>blood</b> <b>relationships</b> embedded in the Indian society and the leanings towards a joint family in strengthening the role of kinsfolk in promoting women entrepreneurs.|$|R
5000|$|Aramaic and Hebrew {{inclined}} to use circumlocutions {{to point out}} <b>blood</b> <b>relationships,</b> calling some people [...] "brothers of Jesus" [...] would not have always implied the same biological mother. But, [...] "sons of the mother of Jesus" [...] would {{have been used to}} indicate a same mother. Scholars and theologians, who assert this view, point out that Jesus was called [...] "the son of Mary" [...] rather than [...] "a son of Mary" [...] in his hometown (Mark 6:3).|$|R
25|$|In China, the Ministry of Public Security has {{established}} a department that solely focuses on child trafficking. Recently the department has instituted a hotline where the public dials 110 to report suspected incidences of forced begging, which law enforcement officials are expected to investigate further. The police are trained to take the children into custody if a <b>blood</b> <b>relationship</b> with their guardian cannot be established, and educate parents on the illegality and dangers of begging if they are {{those responsible for the}} child's action. This policy instituted in April 2009 has since led to the recovery of 9,300 children.|$|E
500|$|Many sources mistakenly list Hooligan and Ephesto as {{brothers}} of José Gutiérrez {{but they are}} not blood relatives. Gutiérrez, Ephesto, and Hooligan trained together and became close friends leading to often referring to each other as [...] "brother" [...] without having any <b>blood</b> <b>relationship.</b> Hooligan and Ephesto are brothers which is why Ephesto is sometimes mistaken for Gutiérrez's brother as well. In 2008 Último Guerrero introduced [...] "Último Guerrero, Jr." [...] to the wrestling world. While {{it is not uncommon for}} fake relatives to be promoted in Lucha Libre it is believed that Último Guerrero, Jr. is indeed the son of Último Guerrero. Later on Guerrero, Jr. would be reintroduced as Gran Guerrero, with the storyline explanation being that Gran Guerrero was the much younger brother of Último Guerrero.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Mac and Sonny, whose name derives from [...] "son", {{is central to}} the film's exploration of the father–child theme. Sonny tries to conjure an image of his biological father, whom he never had the chance to know, through old photographs, his mother's memories and visits to his father's grave. Sonny finds a father figure in Mac—when another young boy asks Sonny if he likes Mac more than his real father, Sonny says that he does, because he never knew the other man; Briley says that this [...] "emphasizes the distinction between companionship and <b>blood</b> <b>relationship</b> Foote has pointed out before." [...] The final scene, in which Mac and Sonny play catch with a football Mac bought him as a gift, symbolizes the fact that although Mac has lost the chance to reconcile with his daughter, he now has a second chance at establishing a father–child relationship with Sonny. The father–child theme also plays out through Mac's relationship with the young band members, who say that he has been an inspiration to them, playing a paternal role in their lives before they even met him. Sledge eventually teams up with the musicians, offering them fatherly counsel in a much more direct way.|$|E
5000|$|The Shakers, who {{believed}} that spiritual ties were more significant than <b>blood</b> <b>relationships,</b> organized the community at Watervliet into four, large [...] "families," [...] each of which formed an independent, self-supporting unit with its own buildings, although all members worshiped in the same meetinghouse. They were known as the [...] "Church," [...] "North," [...] "West," [...] and [...] "South" [...] families. [...] At its high point, the community had 350 members and 2500 acre of land.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{criminal}} activity, the syndicate is there to promote, and engage in, organized crime, that is, organizations which run common illegal businesses on a large, national, or international scale. The subunit of the syndicate is a crime family or clan, organized by <b>blood</b> <b>relationships,</b> {{as seen in the}} Italian Mafia and the Italian American Mafia crime families (the Five Families dominating New York City crime, namely, the Gambino crime family, Genovese crime family, Lucchese crime family, Bonanno crime family, and the Colombo crime family).|$|R
50|$|These secret {{societies}} {{in the areas of}} Calabria rich in olives and vines were distinct from the often anarchic forms of banditry and were organized hierarchically with a code of conduct that included omertà - the code of silence - according to a sentence from the court in Reggio Calabria in 1890. An 1897 sentence from the court in Palmi mentioned a written code of rules found in the village of Seminara based on honour, secrecy, violence, solidarity (often based on <b>blood</b> <b>relationships)</b> and mutual assistance.|$|R
500|$|Debate has raged {{regarding}} how unusual this pairing {{was based on}} the couple's age and <b>blood</b> <b>relationship.</b> Noted Poe biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn argues it was not particularly unusual, nor was Poe's nicknaming his wife [...] "Sissy" [...] or [...] "Sis". Another Poe biographer, Kenneth Silverman, contends that though their first-cousin marriage was not unusual, her young age was. It has been suggested that Clemm and Poe had a relationship more like that between brother and sister than between husband and wife. Biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn disagreed with this view, citing a fervent love letter to argue that Poe [...] "loved his little cousin not only with the affection of a brother, but also with the passionate devotion of a lover and prospective husband." [...] Some scholars, including Marie Bonaparte, have read many of Poe's works as autobiographical and have concluded that Virginia died a virgin. It has been speculated {{that she and her husband}} never consummated their marriage, although no evidence is given. This interpretation often assumes that Virginia is represented by the title character in the poem [...] "Annabel Lee": a [...] "maiden... by the name of Annabel Lee". Poe biographer Joseph Wood Krutch suggests that Poe did not need women [...] "in the way that normal men need them", but only as a source of inspiration and care, and that Poe was never interested in women sexually. Friends of Poe suggested that the couple did not share a bed for at least the first two years of their marriage but that, from the time she turned 16, they had a [...] "normal" [...] married life until the onset of her illness.|$|E
2500|$|... "Denunciation {{of images}} and {{concentration}} on the abstract in writing {{opened the way for}} advance from <b>blood</b> <b>relationship</b> to universal ethical standards and strengthened the position of the prophets in their opposition to absolute monarchical power. The abhorrence of idolatry of graven images implied a sacred power in writing, observance of the law, and worship of the one true God." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{has stated}} that despite his <b>blood</b> <b>relationship</b> with his father Mike, his {{stepfather}} Bill Leonard had far more of an impact on his life.

60|$|Dramatists, {{when they}} write their plays, have a {{delightful}} privilege of prefixing {{a list of}} their personages;--and the dramatists of old used to tell us who {{was in love with}} whom, and what were the <b>blood</b> <b>relationships</b> of all the persons. In such a narrative as this, any proceeding of that kind would be unusual,--and therefore the poor narrator has been driven to expend his first four chapters in the mere task of introducing his characters. He regrets the length of these introductions, and will now begin at once the action of his story.|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} sin of anthropology was {{to divide the}} world into civilized and savage. The social systems of all those other peoples supposedly rested upon a foundation of <b>blood</b> <b>relationships.</b> Anthropologists therefore became at once the experts on the primitive and on kinship. In the 1970 s Western kinship systems began to undergo radical change. Simultaneously, the old orthodoxies about kinship crumbled in anthropology. Young ethnographers generally lost interest in the topic. Kinship systems have nevertheless not gone away, {{out there in the}} world. But to understand them we must first abandon the opposition between the modern and the traditional, the West and the Rest...|$|R
30|$|Three {{differences}} are important. First, the Japanese system of zaibatsu and keiretsu is bank-centered. By contrast, the Korean government prevents a chaebol from owning banks, so that chaebols developed internal market transactions and tight government relationships. Second, chaebols are more hierarchical and centralized around a founding family than the Japanese system, partly reflecting their more recent history. Interestingly, the Korean system highlights <b>blood</b> <b>relationships,</b> while the Japanese focuses on family tradition in which adopted children or a son-in-law can {{carry on the}} tradition. Third, contrary to tight family control in chaebol, the Japanese system has greater separation of ownership and management, in part because a single family rarely controls a whole Japanese network.|$|R

2500|$|It {{was at once}} {{evident to}} Rivers that [...] "the names applied to {{the various forms of}} <b>blood</b> <b>relationship</b> did not {{correspond}} to those used by Europeans, but belonged to what is known as a 'classificatory system'; a man's 'brothers' or 'sisters' might include individuals we should call cousins and the key to this nomenclature {{is to be found in}} forms of social organisation especially in varieties of the institution of marriage." [...] Rivers found that relationship terms were used to imply definite duties, privileges and mutual restrictions in conduct, rather than being biologically based as ours are. As Head puts it: [...] "all these facts were clearly demonstrable by the genealogical method, a triumphant generalisation which has revolutionised ethnology." ...|$|E
50|$|Section 1 consolidates the offence of incest. It applies when a {{male and}} a female related in certain ways have sexual intercourse.

The Ndrangheta {{consists}} of 160 cells and approximately 6,000 members, worldwide some estimate there to {{be as many as}} 10,000 core members and specializes in kidnapping and political corruption. The Ndrangheta cells are loosely connected family groups based on <b>blood</b> <b>relationships</b> and marriages. Ndrangheta presence in the United States is estimated between 100 and 200 members and associates. The majority of that presence is in New York and Florida. The Ndrangheta is also known to engage in cocaine (controlling up to 80% of that flowing through Europe) and heroin trafficking, murder, bombings, counterfeiting, illegal gambling, frauds, thefts, labor racketeering, loansharking, illegal immigration, and kidnapping.|$|R
50|$|Maike Vogt-Lüerssen {{argues that}} the famous {{painting}} actually depicts Bia's younger, legitimate half sister, Maria de' Medici. Vogt-Lüerssen noted {{in an article in}} Medicea - Rivista interdisciplinare di studi medicei that the subject of the portrait was identified as Maria until the 1950s and the pearls depicted in the portrait were a common symbol of the Medicis, often worn by legitimate female members of the house. Vogt-Lüerssen believes that the child depicted in a famous portrait by Pontormo with Maria Salviati is actually Bia, her eldest granddaughter, because group portraits in that era depicted family members with close <b>blood</b> <b>relationships</b> and Salviati's two younger granddaughters, Maria and Isabella, were too young at Salviati's death to be the 5- or 6-year-old girl in the portrait.|$|R
