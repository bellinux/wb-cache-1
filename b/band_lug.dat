5000|$|Spin Magazine: [...] "This time, the <b>band</b> <b>lug</b> the still-smoking amps {{from their}} lightning-strike live show {{into the studio}} and let the noise chase the midnite {{vultures}} away." [...] Grade: 9.1/10 ...|$|E
50|$|A modern-day bagad {{consists}} of a biniou braz (bagpipe), a bombarde section, a drum corps, perhaps more accurately described nowadays as a 'large and varied percussion section' (one <b>band's</b> percussionists <b>lug</b> around a huge metal model elephant), and any additional musical instruments the band wishes to add. Common additions are clarinets, brass instruments (often trumpets or saxophones), guitars, {{and other forms of}} binious.|$|R
50|$|More recently, the Auto-Ordnance {{division}} of Kahr Arms began production of an M1 carbine replica in 2005 {{based on the}} typical M1 carbine as issued in 1944, without the later adjustable sight or barrel <b>band</b> with bayonet <b>lug.</b> The original Auto-Ordnance had produced various parts for IBM carbine production during World War II, but did not manufacture complete carbines until the introduction of this replica. The AOM110 and AOM120 models (no longer produced) featured birch stocks and handguards, Parkerized receivers, flip-style rear sights and barrel <b>bands</b> without bayonet <b>lugs.</b> The current AOM130 and AOM140 models are identical except for American walnut stocks and handguards.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the effects of}} material and geometric variables on the response of U-shaped band-reinforced metallic lugs was performed. Variables studied were reinforcement, adhesive and metallic lug mechanical properties, hole diameter, reinforcement and adhesive thickness, and the distance from the hole s center {{to the end of the}} <b>lug.</b> Generally, U-shaped <b>band</b> reinforced <b>lugs</b> exhibited superior performance than non-reinforced lugs, that is higher load at the conventional lug design criteria of four percent hole elongation. Depending upon the reinforcement configuration the increase in load may be negligible to 15 or 20 percent. U-shaped <b>band</b> reinforcement increases <b>lug</b> load carrying capability primarily through two mechanisms; increasing the slope of the response curve after the initial knee and restraining overall deformation of the metallic portion of the lug facilitating increased yielding of metallic material between the hole and the edge of the metallic portion of the lug...|$|R
5000|$|The carbine (official {{designation}} link=no; [...] "Cavalry Repeating-Carbine M1895") was chambered 8×50mmR Mannlicher {{and used}} by cavalry units of the Austro-Hungarian Army as a replacement of the Mannlicher M1890 carbine. The sights were graduated 500-2400 paces (375-1800 m). Although it originally didn't have bayonet lugs, during World War I it was fitted with stutzen-like front barrel <b>band</b> with bayonet <b>lugs</b> after mounted cavalry units were found ineffective.|$|R
50|$|As {{carbines}} were reconditioned, parts such as {{the magazine}} catch, rear sight, barrel <b>band</b> without bayonet <b>lug,</b> and stock were upgraded with current standard-issue parts. Also, both during and after WW2, many semi-automatic M1 carbines were converted to select-fire M2 carbines by using the T17 and T18 conversion kits. The conversion included a modified sear and slide and added a disconnector, disconnector lever, and selector switch that could be set for semi-auto or full-automatic fire.|$|R
50|$|The Mauser Model 1895 is a {{modification}} of the Mauser Model 1893. The flush-mounted staggered column box magazine has a capacity of 5 smokeless powder 7×57mm Mauser cartridges. The magazine can be loaded from a stripper clip, or with individual rounds. The stock has a straight wrist and a handguard which stretches from the receiver ring to the lower barrel band. The upper <b>band</b> has a <b>lug</b> for the Model 1895 bayonet.|$|R
5000|$|Carbines {{originally}} issued {{with the}} M1A1 folding stock {{were made by}} Inland, a division of General Motors and originally came with the early [...] "L" [...] nonadjustable sight and barrel <b>band</b> without bayonet <b>lug.</b> Inland production of M1A1 carbines was interspersed with Inland production of M1 carbines with the standard stock. Stocks were often swapped out as carbines were refurbished at arsenals. An original Inland carbine with an original M1A1 stock is rare today.|$|R
5000|$|The Merrill rifle was {{produced}} from 1862-65 {{with a total}} quantity estimated at over 800. The rifle was a [...]54 caliber, single -shot, percussion, breechloader with an action identical to the Merrill Carbine, but with a 33 inch barrel, two barrel <b>bands,</b> and a <b>lug</b> for attaching a bayonet. It also had a brass patchbox similar to the First Type carbine. Serial numbers are in the [...] "5000 - 14000" [...] range. Of the rifles produced, 770 were purchased by the Union government during the Civil War. Most were issued to infantry regiments with small quantities issued to sharpshooters.|$|R
