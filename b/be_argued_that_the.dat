5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
25|$|After this {{decision}} it could plausibly <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> overall ban on translations {{announced in the}} encyclicals of 1836 and 1839 {{was no longer in}} force.|$|E
25|$|With {{the arrival}} of Mike Gascoyne as {{technical}} director, alongside the announcements of Jarno Trulli and Ralf Schumacher for 2005, it could <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Toyota F1 operation took on a slightly different feel {{over the course of}} the 2004 season.|$|E

25|$|The Yiddish {{variant of}} Yeshivish is {{questionable}} as a definition in itself, since the grammar remains {{identical to that}} of Yiddish. It may <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Yiddish variant of Yeshivish is a new phenomenon, and consists of less Germanic terms and more Aramaic and Rabbinical Hebrew.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly, the Governor-General {{represents}} New Zealand {{abroad and}} is accorded the same respect and privileges {{of a head}} of state. It can <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> de facto head of state is the Governor-General while the de jure head of state remains the Sovereign. The current Governor-General is Her Excellency the Right Honourable Dame Patsy Reddy, GNZM, QSO, DStJ.|$|E
25|$|Lankester {{therefore}} had a {{far better}} education than most English biologists of the previous generation, such as Huxley, Wallace and Bates. Even so, it could <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> influence of his father Edwin {{and his friends were}} just as important. Huxley was a close friend of the family, and whilst still a child Ray met Hooker, Henfrey, Clifford, Gosse, Owen, Forbes, Carpenter, Lyell, Murchison, Henslow and Darwin.|$|E

25|$|Space {{manufacturing}} {{could enable}} self-replication. Some think it {{the ultimate goal}} because it allows an exponential increase in colonies, while eliminating costs to and dependence on Earth. It could <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> establishment of such a colony would be Earth's first act of self-replication. Intermediate goals include colonies that expect only information from Earth (science, engineering, entertainment) and colonies that just require periodic supply of light weight objects, such as integrated circuits, medicines, genetic material and tools.|$|E
25|$|It can <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{presence}} of Robert Kardashian on Simpson's legal team, {{combined with the}} press coverage of the trial, would ultimately be the catalyst for the ongoing popularity of the Kardashian family. While Kardashian's ex-wife Kris Jenner was already married to former Olympic gold medalist Caitlyn Jenner (then known as Bruce) {{at the time of}} the trial, Kardashian's family was mostly out of the public eye before the trial, only becoming famous due to the trial.|$|E
25|$|While many Provisional IRA {{volunteers were}} {{reportedly}} {{unhappy with the}} end of armed struggle short of the achievement of a united Ireland, the peace strategy has since resulted in substantial electoral and political gains for Sinn Féin, the movement's political wing. It may now <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sinn Féin political party has eclipsed the Provisional IRA as {{the most important part of}} the republican movement. The ceasefire of 1994 therefore, while not a definitive end to Provisional IRA operations, marked the effective end of its full scale armed campaign.|$|E

25|$|Applying the {{reasonable}} suspicion test {{from the perspective}} of an ordinary member of the public can ensure that public confidence in the judiciary remains unshaken. Nonetheless, Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong has made an ex curiae (out-of-court) statement to the effect that where the allegation of apparent bias is made by a professional man (such as a lawyer) against a court or a tribunal, as in Singh Kalpanath, it may <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> better viewpoint should be from that of the legal profession or the professional class, and not that of the layman.|$|E
25|$|Mycorrhizas {{from the}} Miocene exhibit a {{vesicular}} morphology closely resembling that of present Glomerales. This conserved morphology {{may reflect the}} ready availability of nutrients provided by the plant hosts in both modern and Miocene mutualisms. However, it can <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> efficacy of signaling processes {{is likely to have}} evolved since the Miocene, and this can not be detected in the fossil record. A finetuning of the signaling processes would improve coordination and nutrient exchange between symbionts while increasing the fitness of both the fungi and the plant symbionts.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} by the European Commission (EC) in 2008 to accord secondary slot trading by European airlines – the practice of buying and selling take-off and landing slots at congested airports – legal recognition resulted in BMI valuing its Heathrow slot holding at £770million. Its first-time inclusion in BMI's 2007 annual report also resulted in a huge boost to the airline's net asset value, which stood at only £12million the year before. It can therefore <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> EC's decision to legalise this practice made BMI an attractive takeover target for other Heathrow-based airlines and helped it avert bankruptcy.|$|E

25|$|The Garratt was, obviously, {{not alone}} {{in the field of}} {{articulated}} locomotives. Aside from the well-known Fairlie and Meyer types, the Garratt had contemporary and similarly-designed competition {{in the form of the}} Union-Garratt, Modified Fairlie and Golwé. Of these, the closest was the Union-Garratt, a type originally conceived owing to the perceived necessity for a rigid connection between a bunker or tender and a firebox fed by a mechanical stoker. Though it could <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NZR G class locomotives were Union-Garratts (having their bunkers mounted on the boiler frames, rather than on the hind engine unit), a more concrete example can be seen in the two South African Railways Union Garratts of classes GH and U.|$|E
25|$|The one {{tangible}} {{result that}} all the research continually focused on is that community-based services, such as those provided by the HCBS waiver programs, provided a higher {{quality of life for}} disabled individuals. It can also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> research upholds the idea that the cost per individual was lower for those enrolled in the HCBS waiver program than for those attending institutions for similar services. The difficulty when collecting research and data for programs with fewer years of operation is concrete evidence for sufficient analysis. It is also critical {{to keep in mind that}} the HCBS waiver program varies state by state with regard to demographics, funding, state policies, and so forth. The most effective changes come as each state analyzes the overall functionality, success, and performance of their individual HCBS waiver program.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of real {{time is not}} solved by simply generating data {{which is based on}} a proxy of ingestion. If such data isn't being parsed and used in an effective fashion to assist patients, caregivers and medical professionals with adherence management, then it is not a useful application of expensive resources. It can <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> highest and best use of technologies such as smart blister packages, are in stratifying patient groups into good compliers and poor compliers. In this case, the poor compliers maybe coached more intensively, and the good compliers have a continued incentive to remain adherent. Real time in this case might be achieved by sending a regular series of SMS, frequency depending on their adherence status, and requesting them to upload their NFC sensor data through their handheld or wrist worn device.|$|E

25|$|Ancient sources mention {{what brought}} Pompey into the alliance, but are silent on what {{interests}} might have brought Crassus into the fold. There are only mentions of Caesar bringing Pompey and Crassus together, which Plutarch {{described as a}} reconciliation. Cassius Dio {{thought that this was}} something that required skill—almost {{as if it were a}} reconciliation of the irreconcilable. In the writings of Suetonius and Plutarch and in some letters and a speech of Cicero, we find clues about both what the interests of Crassus may have been, and indications that Crassus and Pompey might have been less irreconcilable that their portrayals suggest and that the three men of the triumvirate had collaborated before. It could <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> formation of the first triumvirate was the result of the marginalisation of an enemy (Caesar) and an outsider (Pompey) and the rebuttal of interests associated with Crassus by the optimates who held sway in the senate.|$|E
25|$|In 1672, however, he {{was forced}} to take action. He entered into an {{alliance}} for the defence of the United Provinces during the Franco-Dutch War; then, after this league had collapsed owing to the defection of the elector of Brandenburg, the more durable Quadruple Alliance was formed for the same purpose, including, besides the emperor, the king of Spain and several German princes, and the war was renewed. At this time, twenty-five years after the Peace of Westphalia, the Empire was virtually a confederation of independent princes, and {{it was very difficult for}} its head to conduct any war with vigor and success, some of its members being in alliance with the enemy and others being only lukewarm in their support of the imperial interests. Thus this struggle, which lasted until the end of 1678, was on the whole unfavourable to Germany, and the advantages of the Treaty of Nijmegen were mostly with France. It can however <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> imperial intervention saved the Netherlands from a complete French invasion.|$|E
500|$|The {{economic}} success of Playford's administration also fuelled {{the rapid growth}} of an immigrant, working and middle-class whose social expectations differed markedly from his traditionalist stance, loosening his grip on power. The demographic changes brought on by Playford's successful economic policies increased {{the number of people who}} had rather different views to his on matters such as education, health, arts, the environment, gambling and alcohol. Blewett and Jaensch said [...] "it can <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> development he fostered ultimately brought about his own political demise." [...] The state's social fabric became more complex, but Playford was unable or unwilling to adapt to their more complicated policital desires.|$|E
