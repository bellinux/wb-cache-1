5|$|Finally {{there is}} often a need to correct for the {{apparent}} movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a spinning top. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as they do now. In the case of the Egyptian pyramids, it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban, a faint star in the constellation of Draco. The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have <b>been</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> the sun in the constellation Capricorn. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E

25|$|According to Early Modern records, benandanti were {{believed}} to have <b>been</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> a caul on their head, which gave them {{the ability to take}} part in nocturnal visionary traditions that occurred on specific Thursdays during the year. During these visions, it was believed that their spirits rode upon various animals into the sky and off to places in the countryside. Here they would take part in various games and other activities with other benandanti, and battle malevolent witches who threatened both their crops and their communities using sticks of sorghum. When not taking part in these visionary journeys, benandanti were also believed to have magical powers {{that could be used for}} healing.|$|E
25|$|Across Europe, {{popular culture}} viewed magical {{abilities}} as either innate or learned; in Friulian folk custom, the benandanti {{were seen as}} having innate powers marked out at birth. Specifically, it was a widely held belief that those who in later life became benandanti were born with a caul, or amniotic sac, wrapped around their heads. In the folklore of Friuli at the time, cauls were imbued with magical properties, being associated {{with the ability to}} protect soldiers from harm, to cause an enemy to withdraw, and to help lawyers win their legal cases. In subsequent centuries, a related folkloric tradition found across much of Italy held to the belief that witches had <b>been</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> a caul.|$|E
25|$|Ovid tells {{this story}} in the Fasti, his long-form poetic work on the Roman calendar. It may explain why the Matronalia, a festival celebrated by married women in honor of Juno as a goddess of childbirth, {{occurred}} {{on the first day}} of Mars' month, which is also marked on a calendar from late antiquity as the birthday of Mars. In the earliest Roman calendar, March was the first month, and the god would have <b>been</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> the new year. Ovid is the only source for the story. He may be presenting a literary myth of his own invention, or an otherwise unknown archaic Italic tradition; either way, in choosing to include the story, he emphasizes that Mars was connected to plant life and was not alienated from female nurture.|$|E

500|$|The rumour {{was that}} Griselda Steevens' reclusiveness and always being veiled were owing to her having <b>been</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> a pig's head. Chambers (1864) speculates that her unusual name {{may have contributed}} to the legend, and notes the common belief that she was named [...] "Grisly" [...] on account of her {{appearance}} when born. It was claimed that while pregnant with Richard and Griselda, Steevens' mother had said [...] "take away your litter of pigs!" [...] to a woman beggar asking for money to feed her children, and Griselda had then <b>been</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> the head and face of a pig. Dismayed by the popular belief that she had a pig's head, Griselda took to sitting on an open balcony to allow the public to see her face. This failed to stem the spread of the rumour, and she commissioned a portrait of herself to be hung in the main hall of the hospital. The portrait failed to have the desired effect; many of the public chose instead to believe a portrait in a pub neighbouring the hospital, which showed Steevens with a pig's head; the pub also displayed a silver trough alleged to have belonged to her. She eventually withdrew from public view completely before her death on 18 March 1746.|$|E

500|$|The {{script is}} also {{thought to have}} been {{inspired}} by Lynch's fear of fatherhood; his daughter Jennifer had <b>been</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> [...] "severely clubbed feet", requiring extensive corrective surgery as a child. Jennifer has said that her own unexpected conception and birth defects were the basis for the film's themes. The film's tone was also shaped by Lynch's time living in a troubled neighborhood in Philadelphia. Lynch and his family spent five years living in an atmosphere of [...] "violence, hate and filth". The area was rife with crime, inspiring the bleak urban backdrop of Eraserhead. Describing this period of his life, Lynch said, [...] "I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe... I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing will set you back". Film critic Greg Olson, in his book David Lynch: Beautiful Dark, posits that this time contrasted starkly with the director's childhood in the Pacific Northwest, giving the director a [...] "bipolar, Heaven-and-Hell vision of America" [...] which has subsequently shaped his films.|$|E
