The animals were previously evaluated by breeding soundness evaluation and thereafter divided into two groups of breeding soundness classes: 1 = 16 <b>animals</b> sound <b>for</b> breeding; 2 = 36 <b>animals</b> unsound <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> by means of physical and morphological analysis of semen.

There was a difference between scrotal circumference between classes, with 39. 7 ± 2. 1 cm and 37. 3 ± 3. 1 cm for sound and unsound animals, respectively. Regarding testicular echotexture, mean values for the pixel intensity were 95. 7 and 94. 0 for sound and unsound <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>breeding,</b> respectively, with no difference between the classes.

Stallion fights were {{an important part of}} Icelandic culture, and brawls, both physical and verbal, among the spectators were common. The conflicts at the horse fights gave rivals a chance to improve their political and social standing at the expense of their enemies and had wide social and political repercussions, sometimes leading to the restructuring of political alliances. [...] However, not all human fights were serious, and the events provided a stage for friends and even enemies to battle without the possibility of major consequences.

Twenty sheep were distributed into four groups that were given diets with 0; 20; 30; 40 % of WCS. For this study the semen was collected by electroejaculation, and a monthly andrological examination was performed during nine months. The analyzed variables were: scrotal circumference (SC), appearance and color of the ejaculate, progressive motility (PM), vigor, mass movement (MM), total sperm concentration (spzX 10 (9)), sperm morphology (SM) and blood hematocrit. The SC had no difference among diets, with mean 31. 83 cm. The animals fed diets with WCS, presented mean intake of 9. 16 mg gossypol kg BW, and were prone to present greenish semen, and appearance ranging from thin creamy to watery. The PM decreased linearly (p < 0. 05) with increasing level of WCS, while the vigor had a quadratic trend. The total defects increased linearly in relation to reference values described in literature. The WSC had no influence on hematocrit levels, but did affect the PM and vigor of spermatozoa, thus not recommended to diets of <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>breeding...</b>|$|R
