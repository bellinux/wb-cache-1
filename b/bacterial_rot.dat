30|$|In rice (Oryza sativa L.), {{damage from}} {{diseases}} such as brown spot, caused by Bipolaris oryzae, and <b>bacterial</b> seedling <b>rot</b> and <b>bacterial</b> grain <b>rot,</b> caused by Burkholderia glumae, has increased under global warming because the optimal temperature ranges for growth of these pathogens are relatively high (around 30  °C). Therefore, the need for cultivars carrying genes for resistance to these diseases is increasing to ensure sustainable rice production. In contrast to the situation for other important rice {{diseases such as}} blast and bacterial blight, no genes for complete resistance to brown spot, <b>bacterial</b> seedling <b>rot</b> or <b>bacterial</b> grain <b>rot</b> have yet been discovered. Thus, rice breeders have to use partial resistance, which is largely influenced by environmental conditions. Recent progress in molecular genetics and improvement of evaluation methods for disease resistance have facilitated detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with resistance. In this review, we summarize the results of worldwide screening for cultivars with resistance to brown spot, <b>bacterial</b> seedling <b>rot</b> and <b>bacterial</b> grain <b>rot</b> and we discuss the identification of QTLs conferring resistance to these diseases {{in order to provide}} useful information for rice breeding programs.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{its wide}} range of hosts, <b>bacterial</b> soft <b>rot</b> devastates many {{significant}} crops both {{in the field and}} in storage all over the world.

Specifically, soft rot of potatoes can cause a huge decrease in yield, and is the most serious bacterial disease that potatoes are exposed to. For a grower of potatoes, there is a possibility that 100% of a whole season's yield could be destroyed due to insufficient conditions in a storage facility.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Observations of <b>bacterial</b> soft <b>rot</b> {{of onions}} in the Lake Labish {{area in the}} Willamette Valley of western Oregon showed that two {{distinct}} symptom types occur during the growing season. The most prevalent symptom type appears in infected plants as a wilting and chlorosis {{of two or more}} lower leaves which is followed closely by appearance of elongated lesions emerging from the neck and extending up the adaxial side of one or more young leaves. Although most infected plants showing these symptoms usually decay quickly, some plants may appear to partially recover if conditions unfavorable for disease development return. A second symptom type is evident in those infected plants in which the collapse of all emerged leaves occurs simultaneously. During leaf collapse, foliar color changes from dark green to grey-green and finally, with desiccation, to light tan. Two kinds of soft rot also occur commonly in stored onions. One kind of decay, commonly called "slippery skin, " is characterized by the progression of soft rot down through {{one or two of the}} outer fleshy scales. These scales turn yellowish, soft, and are foul smelling. A second kind of soft rot is characterized by the interior of the bulb being totally macerated and putrid, but only slightly discolored. Only one or two of the outer fleshy scales remain firm. This decay is commonly called "stinking rot" because of its very offensive odor. Initial appearance of <b>bacterial</b> soft <b>rot</b> in the third week of June is directly related to occurrence of rain and cool, cloudy weather in the previous week. Occurrence of such periods of inclement weather are found to be predictable when past records of local climatological conditions are analyzed. Area-wide outbreaks throughout the remainder of the growing season also are related to such periods of inclement weather. The relationship between weather and disease suggests that outbreaks of <b>bacterial</b> soft <b>rot</b> can be forecast by occurrence of such periods of inclement weather. Irrigation of onions with contaminated surface waters significantly increases the amount of <b>bacterial</b> soft <b>rot</b> in the field, at harvest time, and in storage, over that found when uncontaminated well water is used. Varying the frequency of irrigations, the rates of application, and the size of sprinkler nozzles affect the amount of soft rot in the field and in storage somewhat less than does the source of water. Longer and more frequent periods of irrigation increase the incidence of <b>bacterial</b> soft <b>rot.</b> Much of the decay seen at harvest is either soft rot which has totally decayed the bulbs and will not go into storage, or is fungal in origin. Including storage rots which are fungal in origin under the general grouping of "soft rots" inflates the estimation of losses due to <b>bacterial</b> soft <b>rot.</b> Three isolates of seventeen unknown isolates capable of decaying inoculated onion bulbs were identified as Pseudomonas cepacia. Five isolates which lack ability to produce a water-soluble fluorescent pigment and possess a nitrate reductase system were otherwise virtually identical to P. cepacia.
