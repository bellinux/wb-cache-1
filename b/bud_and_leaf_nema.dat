Kranji (Pongamia pinnata Merril) is one type of forest plants that have the potential as a source of renewable energy in the future. Kranji seed produces vegetable biofeul material, so we need another way to get the seedlings, one of them by cuttings. Moreover, the traits of the parent will be derived through vegetative propagation. This study aimed to determine the effect of plant material to the success of cuttings kranji. The plant treatment factors included the types of buds, shoots age, the part of <b>buds</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaf</b> on <b>buds.</b> The experiment based on the type of shoots used a randomized block design consisted of two treatments, dormant <b>buds</b> <b>and</b> growing shoots, with 5 replications, each treatment combination consisted of 50 cuttings. The experiment based on the age of shoot used a randomized block design consisted of 5 treatments (ages of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months) with 5 replications, each treatment combination consisted of 50 cuttings. The experiment based on the part of shoot used a randomized block design consisted of three treatments (base, middle, and end of shoots) with 5 replications, each treatment combination consisted of 50 cuttings. Meanwhile, the treatment based on the leaf on buds used a randomized block design consisted of two treatments (with <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> without <b>leaf)</b> with 5 replications, each treatment combination consisted of 50 cuttings.

40|$|Main conclusion: Leaf {{initiation}} rate {{is largely}} {{determined by the}} apical bud temperature even when apical bud temperature largely deviates from the temperature of other plant organs. We {{have long known that}} the rate of leaf initiation (LIR) is highly sensitive to temperature, but previous studies in dicots have not rigorously demonstrated that apical bud temperature controls LIR independent of other plant organs temperature. Many models assume that apical <b>bud</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaf</b> temperature are the same. In some environments, the temperature of the apical bud, where leaf initiation occurs, may differ by several degrees Celsius from the temperature of other plant organs. In a 28 -days study, we maintained temperature differences between the apical <b>bud</b> <b>and</b> the rest of the individual Cucumis sativus plants from − 7 to + 8 °C by enclosing the apical buds in transparent, temperature-controlled, flow-through, spheres. Our results demonstrate that LIR was completely determined by apical bud temperature independent of other plant organs temperature. These results emphasize the need to measure or model apical bud temperatures in dicots to improve the prediction of crop development rates in simulation models. </p...|$|R

40|$|Many studies {{investigated}} temperature {{effects on}} <b>leaf</b> initiation <b>and</b> expansion by relating these processes to air temperature or {{the temperature of}} a specific organ (e. g. leaf temperature).

In a 28 day study, we maintained temperature differences between Tbud and Tplant ranging from − 7 to + 8 °C using a custom-made bud temperature control system. Leaf expansion did not only depend on leaf temperature but also on the difference between <b>bud</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaf</b> temperature. Differences between Tbud and Tplant considerably influenced vertical leaf area distribution over the shoot: increasing Tbud beyond Tplant resulted in more and smaller leaves, while decreasing Tbud below Tplant resulted in less and larger leaves.

Proper timing of these responses is particularly important for survival of trees in the boreal and subarctic regions. Therefore, we used a northern tree species, silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) as an experimental model to investigate the effect of SD and LT on development of freezing tolerance and on levels of endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) in short-term experiments under controlled conditions. We characterized differences in SD and LT-induced cold acclimation between three different climatic ecotypes from southern, central and northern habitats. The results demonstrated that cold acclimation was rapidly triggered by exposing the plants to SD or LT, and {{that a combination of}} the different treatments had an additive effect on freezing tolerance. Freezing tolerance induction was not uniform in the different tissues, the <b>buds</b> <b>and</b> leaves developed freezing tolerance more rapidly than the stem, and the young leaves had a higher freezing tolerance than the old leaves.

Development of freezing tolerance was dependent on the climatic ecotype, the northern ecotype was clearly more responsive to both SD and LT than the two more southern ecotypes.
