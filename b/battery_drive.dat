40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method of {{generating}} {{higher number of}} levels in the voltage waveform by stacking multilevel converters with lower voltage space vector structures. An important feature of this stacked structure {{is the use of}} low voltage devices while attaining higher number of levels. This will find extensive applications in electric vehicles since direct <b>battery</b> <b>drive</b> is possible. The voltages of all the capacitors in the structure can be controlled within a switching cycle using the switching state redundancies (pole voltage redundancies). This helps in reducing the capacitor size. Also, the capacitor voltages can be balanced irrespective of modulation index and load power factor. To verify the concept experimentally, a nine-level inverter is developed by stacking two five-level inverters and an induction motor is run using V/f control scheme. Both steady state and transient results are presented...|$|E

Four hinge-type electromagnetic actuators arranged serially in one line pinch a flexible tube and generate peristaltic motion on the tube.

40|$|The {{lifetime}} of a stand-alone media recorder {{is a function}} of both the battery size and flash memory size. In this paper, we present a power management framework for media recorders that signifi-cantly enhances their lifetime while minimizing the flash memory usage and maintaining the same level of recording quality. This is achieved by implementing a mixture of encoding algorithms of dif-ferent complexities that generate data with different compression ratios, and in turn balancing the energy consumption and the flash memory usage. The proposed method can be effectively employed on a direct <b>battery</b> <b>drive</b> system which does not use a DC–DC converter. The gradual drop of the battery voltage of such system is compensated by operating algorithms of lower complexity more and more. For a speech encoding application where a mixture of ADPCM (low complexity) and MP 3 (high complexity) is used, the proposed al-gorithm achieves 70 % more lifetime than a DC–DC converter with a highest clock frequency, and 20 % more lifetime than even a DC– DC converter with the optimal clock frequency...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{configuration}} of six phase IM to drive from a three phase stacked multilevel inverter. Apart from greater fault tolerance compared to three phase, a six phase machine enables {{the use of}} low voltage devices for the inverter. Also the inverter used here is a three phase nine level stacked inverter which itself uses low voltage devices. Thus MOSFETs can be used for the inverter. The nine level inverter is formed by stacking 2 five level inverters each of which is developed by cascading an FC and a capacitor fed H-bridge. The inverter can be stacked further to obtain still higher number of voltage levels. This {{enables the use of}} batteries at the front end and still lower voltage devices which will significanly improve the efficiency. Hence this will find applications in electric vehicles because of the direct <b>battery</b> <b>drive.</b> Experiment is conducted on a 15 KW six phase IM by reconfiguring it as a three phase machine and driven by the three phase nine level stacked inverter using V/f control scheme.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis addresses the design of control systems for a parallel hybrid electric drive train which is an alternative to conventional passenger vehicles. The principle components of the drive train are a small internal combustion engine and an electric machine. In the parallel configuration, both devices can apply torque directly to the drive shaft for propelling the vehicle. A low order drive train model is developed which is used during the controller design and overall system simulations. The model is composed of sub-models for the engine, mechanical brake, electric machine, converter, <b>battery,</b> <b>drive</b> shaft with gears, and road load with wind resistance. The model yields results which are rough approximations of component performance and are appropriate for a top level drive train control study. In order to mimic the controls of a conventional car, the hybrid vehicle controller must insure that the torque command given by the user through the accelerator and brake pedal is tracked by the hybrid drive train without error. In this thesis two control systems are designed which enable the drive train to emulate conventional vehicle performance by meeting torque commands. The first control design maximizes the battery state-of-charge by minimizing the torque contribution of the electric machine. The second control design includes a cost parameter allowing the user to specify the appropriate tradeoff between a high state-of-charge and increased fuel savings. Simulation results verify that both controllers achieve the design objectives. Results also suggest that under proper control the parallel hybrid drive train can offer equal performance and range to a conventional passenger vehicle with improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions...|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric {{carbon dioxide}} and {{pollution}} due to the {{burning of fossil fuels}} is increasing. Many scientists attribute global warming to the rising levels of {{carbon dioxide and}} other pollutants, some of which also pose risks to health. These can be reduced by the more efficient use of conventional fuels and the development of non-polluting energy resources. Fuel cells offer a highly efficient and low polluting method of generating electricity, and are under development for both the power generation and transport sectors. There is a need to assess (a) emissions from fuel cells using various fuels and (b) ways of introducing such technology to transportation in the near future. Fuel consumption, energy and emissions from the production and use of fuels (hydrogen, methane, propane, petrol, diesel, alcohols and rape methyl ester) are calculated per kilowatt hour of fuel cell output over a range of efficiency. These are compared with those for internal combustion engines with advanced exhaust control and for the recharging of <b>battery</b> <b>driven</b> vehicles. The results, which are applicable to both transport and power generation, enable the best low pollution fuels to be selected and are used to calculate through life emissions for public transport buses. Fuel cells are an ideal solution to reduce pollution from transport, but their commercial development in this field is further away than that for stationary applications. Thus, a transition stage is recommended where fuel cell electrical power stations, based on existing demonstrators, are used to recharge fleets of <b>battery</b> <b>driven</b> vehicles during the development of mobile fuel cell systems. These fleets include public transport and commercial vehicles. Also, fuel cell power stations could provide energy for electric trains. A combined system is proposed where electric trains recharge <b>battery</b> <b>driven</b> commercial vehicles during long journeys. The above proposals would enhance fuel cell development, introducing them alongside current transport systems, possibly using the same fuel...|$|R
