5|$|Written by Kim Hyun-jun, Jo Gyu-won, and Kim Jae-un, {{the series}} began {{pre-production}} without {{the backing of}} a Korean broadcaster {{in an attempt to}} spark a <b>bidding</b> <b>war</b> amongst potential suitors.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Sunoco {{was awarded}} the {{franchise}} to operate the filling stations at the Sideling Hill and now-closed Hempfield travel plazas.

50|$|The {{economics}} of free agency are disadvantageous for team owners; {{it can lead}} to bidding wars—and increased player salaries mean decreased owner profits. Restrictions on free agency have therefore been preferred by North American team owners since the abolition of the reserve clause. For example, a draft can be used to keep young and talented players from generating <b>bidding</b> <b>wars</b> and causing higher player salaries throughout the league. Furthermore, some teams which play in large market cities, and hence have a larger revenue stream, would be able to outbid other teams for talented players. Some leagues, such as the National Football League and the National Basketball Association have imposed salary cap rules in order to avert such <b>bidding</b> <b>wars</b> (the NFL itself was imposed in an effort to monopolize pro football and prevent <b>bidding</b> <b>wars</b> that had crippled preceding regional leagues like the Ohio League and Pittsburgh circuit).|$|R
5000|$|At one point, {{during the}} 1960s and '70s, CBS Sports, under MacPhail, owned {{the rights to}} all major sports events--pro football, basketball, the Triple Crown, the Masters tournament and other major golf events, except Major League Baseball. MacPhail {{attempted}} to acquire the baseball rights, then owned by NBC, from Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. Kuhn seemed very interested, but the higher up at CBS declined--they didn't want to start <b>bidding</b> <b>wars</b> for sports rights. When Roone Arledge was appointed head of ABC Sports, he thought differently and thus the <b>bidding</b> <b>wars</b> began.|$|R
5|$|In November 2013, Lorde {{signed a}} {{publishing}} deal with Songs Music Publishing, worth a reported US$2.5million, after a <b>bidding</b> <b>war</b> between various companies, including Sony Music Entertainment and her label UMG. The agreement gives the publisher {{the right to}} license Lorde's music for films and advertising. Late that year, she started a relationship with photographer James Lowe.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Leon Hess' death in May 1999, the team was put up for auction in January 2000. In a <b>bidding</b> <b>war</b> between Charles F. Dolan and Woody Johnson, Johnson emerged victorious, and he {{purchased}} the team for $635 million. Johnson expressed interest in having Parcells return to his coaching role; the team elevated linebackers coach Al Groh to the head coaching position when Parcells refused.|$|E
5|$|Belushi {{had become}} a star in 1978 {{as a result of}} both the Blues Brothers' musical success and his role in National Lampoon's Animal House. At one point, he managed the triple feat of being the star of the week's top-grossing film, top-rated {{television}} show, and singing on the number-one album within a year. When Aykroyd and Belushi decided they could make a Blues Brothers film, the <b>bidding</b> <b>war</b> was intense. Universal Studios narrowly beat Paramount Pictures for the project. John Landis, who had directed Belushi in Animal House, was aboard as director.|$|E
50|$|The 1919 {{expansion}} of top-level professional football threatened to drastically increase {{the cost of}} the game by sparking <b>bidding</b> <b>wars.</b> The various regional circuits determined that forming a league, with enforceable rules, would mitigate these problems.|$|R
50|$|Currie {{has gained}} a strong {{reputation}} as an advocate of open and transparent media, and as {{a critic of the}} cash <b>bidding</b> <b>wars</b> that can characterise popular newspaper and magazine journalism elsewhere in the New Zealand media and overseas.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and early 1940s, Major League franchises found {{themselves}} bidding {{against one another}} for the services of young players. These engagements subsided when World War II broke out. When the <b>war</b> ended, the <b>bidding</b> <b>wars</b> resumed.|$|R
5|$|Janet (stylized as janet.) is {{the fifth}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Janet Jackson, released on May 18, 1993, by Virgin Records America. Prior to its release, Jackson {{was at the center}} of a high-profile <b>bidding</b> <b>war</b> over her recording contract. In 1991, her original label A sought to renew her contract, while others, such as Atlantic, Capitol, and Virgin all vied to sign her. After meeting with Virgin owner Richard Branson, she signed with the label. The contract was worth an astronomical $40 million dollars, making her the world's then-highest paid musical act.|$|E
5|$|She {{went to work}} at Vogue {{later when}} Alex Liberman, {{editorial}} director for Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue, talked to Wintour about a position there in 1983. She eventually accepted after a <b>bidding</b> <b>war</b> that doubled her salary, becoming the magazine's first creative director, a position with vaguely defined responsibilities. Her changes to the magazine were often made without Mirabella's knowledge, causing friction among the staff. She began dating child psychiatrist David Shaffer, an older acquaintance from London. They married in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The film {{rights to}} the book had become {{the subject of a}} <b>bidding</b> <b>war</b> among a host of {{established}} film studios, including Warner Bros., Sony Pictures Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks and Universal Pictures. Universal eventually secured the rights in August 2007 for more than $2 million. The studio had also acquired the United States distribution rights as part of a negative pickup deal with the film's producers. Berg however chose to direct Battleship (2012) for Universal before resuming production on Lone Survivor.|$|E

50|$|David Chappe (born November 8, 1947 in Brooklyn - May 13, 2002 in Los Angeles) {{was best}} known as the screenwriter who {{launched}} the <b>bidding</b> <b>wars</b> of the late 1980s with his script Gale Force. David was a novelist, photographer, screenwriting instructor, story editor, artist and pianist.|$|R
5|$|ATV Music {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue, Northern Songs, in 1969. The catalog featured almost every song written by Lennon–McCartney. Northern Songs was co-owned by Lennon, McCartney, Brian Epstein and Dick James, who owned a controlling interest. In 1969, James offered to sell his shares to ATV. Lennon and McCartney then attempted to gain a controlling interest in the company. Their bid to gain control, part of a long and acrimonious fight, failed. The financial clout of Grade, their adversary in the <b>bidding</b> <b>war,</b> ensured that the songs written by the two Beatles passed into the control of ATV.|$|E
5|$|Keith Cozart (born August 15, 1995), {{better known}} by his stage name Chief Keef, is an American rapper and record {{producer}} from Chicago, Illinois. During his teenage years and while under house arrest, Keef's music videos {{were met with}} acclaim from local high school students. His increasing popularity led to him being {{the subject of a}} brief <b>bidding</b> <b>war</b> among labels. Ultimately, Keef signed a major record deal with Interscope Records and later signed with 1017 Brick Squad. Keef also became the CEO of his own record label, Glory Boyz Entertainment, which later developed into Glo Gang.|$|E
5|$|The film {{rights to}} Evita became {{the subject of}} a <b>bidding</b> <b>war</b> among a host of {{established}} film studios, including Warner Bros., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures. Stigwood sold the rights to EMI Films for over $7.5 million. He also discussed the project with Jon Peters, who promised that he would convince his girlfriend Barbra Streisand to play the lead role if he were allowed to produce. Stigwood turned down the offer, opting to stay involved as the film's sole producer. EMI ultimately dropped the project after merging with Thorn Electrical Industries to form Thorn EMI, as well as producing several box office flops under the banner.|$|E
50|$|Texas Car Wars was an American reality {{documentary}} {{television series}} on the Discovery Channel. The series debuted on September 9, 2012 and follows four auto body shops who participate in <b>bidding</b> <b>wars</b> {{in order to find}} the most valuable junk cars and refurbish them into jackpots.|$|R
5000|$|The {{strategy}} {{that is usually}} employed by the Hostile Firm is making an offer more lucrative than the White Knight's, so that the shareholders consider rejecting the White Knight's bid. This, however, can lead to <b>bidding</b> <b>wars</b> and finally to overpaying, by one or the other, for the target firm.|$|R
50|$|The Oil City Athletic Club was a {{professional}} football team based in Oil City, Pennsylvania from 1893 until 1903. The team was the intrastate rival of the Franklin Athletic Club.

5|$|Universal Studios, {{which had}} won the <b>bidding</b> <b>war</b> for the film, was hoping to take {{advantage}} of Belushi's popularity in the wake of Saturday Night Live, Animal House, and the Blues Brothers' musical success; it soon found itself unable to control production costs. The start of filming was delayed when Aykroyd, new to film screenwriting, took six months to deliver a long and unconventional script that Landis had to rewrite before production, which began without a final budget. On location in Chicago, Belushi's partying and drug use caused lengthy and costly delays that, along with the destructive car chases depicted onscreen, made the final film {{one of the most expensive}} comedies ever produced.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{airlines}} {{interested in a}} takeover of Virgin America approached the airline in late 2015, prompting Virgin America to correspond with an undisclosed financial adviser about how and if to proceed with a sale. Alaska Air Group and JetBlue Airways were the two most interested companies to make offers to purchase the airline from Virgin Group. In December 2015, Alaska was interested at $44.75 per share, before JetBlue manifested its interest in February 2016. A <b>bidding</b> <b>war</b> ensued culminating on March 31 and April 1 at $57 per share, % higher than the day's closure at $38.9. On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced that it had agreed to buy Virgin America for $2.6 billion. Including debt and aircraft leases, the transaction was worth approximately $4 billion. Had the merger agreement been terminated by Virgin America, {{they would have been}} contractually obligated to pay Alaska Air Group a termination fee equal to $78.5 million.|$|E

Open Road Films acquired the distribution {{rights in the}} United States for around $4.5 million. Nightcrawler had its world premiere on September 5, at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. It also screened at several other film festivals, including the Atlantic Film Festival, Fantastic Fest, and the Rome Film Festival. The film was originally scheduled for a theatrical release on October 17, but Open Road Films moved the release to October 31, to avoid competition with several bigger-budget films like Fury, Birdman, Dracula Untold, and The Book of Life.|$|E
50|$|For the 1965 season, the Chiefs {{were caught}} in the middle of the AFL and NFL's <b>bidding</b> <b>wars</b> for college talent.

5000|$|Experienced bidders on online auctions with fixed ending-times often prefer {{entering}} bids late in {{the auction}} to avoid <b>bidding</b> <b>wars</b> (multiple rounds of bidders each increasing their maximum bid to temporarily regain [...] "current highest bid" [...] status) or bid chasing (where {{the presence of an}} existing bid encourages others to bid on the same item).|$|R
5|$|In the 1990s, {{the club}} was located west of Michigan Avenue and behind the 620 {{building}} which was home to many of Chicago's finest art dealers including Richard Gray and Richard L. Feigen & Co. The Arts club did not own the land upon which their famous Mies clubhouse was built; instead, the club held the land in a longterm leasehold. In 1990, the owner of 620 N. Michigan and the Arts Club land decided to sell. At first the Arts Club hoped {{to raise the money}} to purchase its land along with the 620 N. Michigan Avenue property in an effort spearheaded by Richard Gray, but it quickly became apparent that the club would lose a <b>bidding</b> <b>war</b> over this valuable land. A developer bought the property and demolished the entire block {{to make way for a}} movie complex and shopping center.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2012, Keef {{was the subject of}} a <b>bidding</b> <b>war</b> with many labels to sign him, {{including}} Young Jeezy's CTE World. While 2013 proved to be a relatively quiet year, in terms of his music output, Keef began the year by signing with Interscope Records, as a separate deal promised his own label imprint, Glory Boyz Entertainment (GBE). The deal was worth $6,000,000 over a three album layout, as well as an additional $440,000 in advance, to establish GBE. The deal also set up rights for Interscope to pull out of the contract in the case that Keef's debut album failed to sell 250,000 copies by December 2013. Chief Keef's debut studio album Finally Rich, was released on December 18, 2012. Featured guests on the album included rappers 50 Cent, Wiz Khalifa, Young Jeezy, Rick Ross and his fellow Glory Boyz member Lil Reese.|$|E
5|$|When {{compared}} to the CHA, the geographical distances between NHA teams were much greater; however, the NHA's financial backers were more notable businessmen. These businessmen applied financial principles {{similar to those of}} early baseball, and the leagues quickly entered a bitter <b>bidding</b> <b>war</b> over players. In particular, after being rejected from the CHA, Renfrew aggressively pursued any players that the CHA's Ottawa club wanted. Montreal became a notable battleground as the NHA established two franchises, including the modern-day Montreal Canadiens. With its significantly wealthier backers, the NHA easily recruited the top players, leaving the CHA teams, except Ottawa, relatively mediocre. Ottawa regularly trounced its opponents, and league attendance and interest dropped. The CHA's final season lasted eight games, and the league folded in 1910, as its Ottawa and Montreal clubs joined the NHA.|$|E

He was narrowly reelected by the legislature.|$|R
