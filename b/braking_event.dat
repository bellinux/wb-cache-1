In this paper, an investigation is reported on how manipulation of the optical looming cue can influence the perception of TTC, and thereby braking behaviour, for automobile driving in a low fidelity simulator. Eleven participants were instructed to follow a leading vehicle (LV) and appropriately respond to the <b>braking</b> <b>events</b> of the LV, which occurred randomly at different deceleration rates. For some <b>braking</b> <b>events,</b> during <b>braking</b> of the LV, size of the LV was expanded without subjects being aware of it. Results showed that subjects braked sooner when confronting an expanding LV compared to a constant-size LV. The experiment supports the theory that drivers use TTC information derived from optic looming to control braking. Potential application of the results to possibly reduce occurrences of rear-end collisions in real automobile driving is also discussed...|$|R
5000|$|While {{energy is}} always lost during a brake event, a {{secondary}} factor that influences efficiency is [...] "off-brake drag", or drag {{that occurs when}} the brake is not intentionally actuated. After a <b>braking</b> <b>event,</b> hydraulic pressure drops in the system, allowing the brake caliper pistons to retract. However, this retraction must accommodate all compliance in the system (under pressure) as well as thermal distortion of components like the brake disc or the brake system will drag until the contact with the disc, for example, knocks the pads and pistons back from the rubbing surface. During this time, there can be significant brake drag. This brake drag can lead to significant parasitic power loss, thus impacting fuel economy and overall vehicle performance.|$|E

This paper describes a study investigating the effect of interacting with a surrogate in-vehicle system task – requiring a two-choice speeded response – in close temporal proximity to a subsequent lead vehicle <b>braking</b> <b>event.</b> The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the 'task-free ' interval required before a <b>braking</b> <b>event</b> to ensure safe braking performance. Drivers (N = 48) were split into six groups and randomly assigned an in-vehicle task defined by stimulus (three levels) and response modality (two levels). Four blocks of inter-mixed single- and dual-task trials were presented. The time interval between the two tasks was varied on dual-task trials. Slower braking responses on dual-task trials relative to single-task trials indicated dual-task interference. Driver braking performance demonstrated the psychological refractory period effect – an increase in reaction time with decreasing temporal separation of the two tasks. The impact of in-vehicle task stimulus and response modality on performance is discussed in relation to predictions based on Multiple Resource Theory. This study demonstrates a fundamental human performance limitation in the real-world driving context and has implications for driver response speeds when distracted. Specifically, the presentation of an in-vehicle task in the 350 milliseconds before a <b>braking</b> <b>event</b> could have severe safety consequences. The use of the findings to manage in-vehicle stimulus presentation is discussed. Problems with implementation of the results are reported...|$|E
40|$|Elevators {{have been}} {{a key element of}} buildings, {{especially}} tall buildings, since their widespread use began in the 19 th century. As a matter of fact, high-rise buildings would not have existed without elevators. Elevators have a myriad of safety features and devices to ensure a safe journey for the passengers. One of these devices is the safety gear. Safety gears are emergency brakes that stop speeding elevators by gripping the guide rails. They are adjusted for a safe deceleration range by the technician during installation and exert a constant force. Due to their purely mechanical nature, once triggered, the safety gear is currently unable to actively adjust the braking force to counteract vibrations, to decelerate at different rates, or to stop the elevator at the closest landing. Therefore, the emergency <b>braking</b> <b>event</b> can be harsh and noticeable, leaving the passengers stuck in the elevator shaft after the <b>braking</b> <b>event.</b> This thesis aims to develop an intelligent safety gear system that is able to bring the elevator to a stop with a safe and adjustable deceleration rate. This was achieved by first, modeling a computer simulation of a small-scale elevator to be able to quickly simulate different <b>braking</b> <b>event</b> scenarios. Second, a small-scale elevator test rig was constructed to test the computer simulation with physical components. The test rig was validated by comparing its results with KONE’s high-rise safety gear test. The control system developed was able to safely stop the moving mass with the desired deceleration {{and a great deal of}} control over other parameters. Further development of the system could lead to a safer, more comfortable, and energy efficient elevator ride...|$|E

Naturalistic data of 5 riders were automatically processed to identify and characterize the braking events based on the given set of parameters. A preliminary descriptive analysis was performed to verify the presence of macro behaviors of riders. Subsequently, a Principal Component Analysis was performed to reduce problem dimensionality and support the cluster analysis on the dataset of a rider. The results indicated that a macro classification of riders is possible also based on a descriptive analysis. Nonetheless a cluster analysis sharply identified different behaviors of the rider, and thus provided a more solid basis for comparison of behavior among riders. In addition, the clusters revealed quantitative data that will be useful {{for the development of}} assistive systems...|$|E

Vehicle acceleration and video data were analysed to m easure head displacement and shoulder belt position.

Average forward head displacement was 160 mm on the booster cushion and 150 mm on the integrated booster cushion. Generally, the belt maintained the same position on the shoulde r throughout braking, with exceptions influenced by shifted initial positions or non‐standard motions. Braking e vents placed the head approximately 150 ‐ 190 mm forward from the initial position, influenced by booster, statu re, and initial seatbelt positioning.

The results show the position of the center of pressure to vary considerably during a <b>braking</b> <b>event,</b> both radially and axially along the pad. The variable "instability envelope" is related to the caliper-mounting geometry which is subsequently compared to the effective "spragging angle" and the generation of brake noise.

The modifications allow the centre of pressure to be controlled both radially and {{along the length of}} the pad, inducing a leading or trailing centre of pressure as desired. The technique is unique in its design and implementation. Both the centre of pressures of the inboard and out-board pads are recorded simultaneously with varying pressures and speeds. The results, which include pressure and force maps, show the position of the centre of pressure to vary considerably during a <b>braking</b> <b>event,</b> both radially and axially along the pad. The CoP offset is related to the calliper mounting geometry which is subsequently compared to the effective “spragging angle” and the generation of brake noise.

The acquired vehicle data is then processed, visualized and analysed according to the concrete requirements. Apart from establishing features like average vehicle speed over a particular route, duration of the service and average waiting time at stops, many other features can be derived from the vehicular motion data gathered by the app. The longitudinal acceleration data, for instance, can be used to detect strong <b>braking</b> <b>events.</b> If <b>braking</b> data is collected over a longer period of time, frequent <b>braking</b> <b>events</b> that occur at particular road/track locations mark dangerous locations.

40|$|Many {{experimental}} studies use repeated lead vehicle braking events {{to study the}} effects of forward collision warning (FCW) systems. It can, however, be argued that the use of repeated events induce expectancies and anticipatory behaviour that may undermine validity in terms of generalisability to real-world, naturalistic, emergency braking events. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to examine to what extent the effect of FCW on response performance is moderated by repeated exposure to a critical lead vehicle <b>braking</b> <b>event.</b> A further objective was to examine if these effects depended on event criticality, here defined as the available time headway when the lead vehicle starts to brake. A critical lead vehicle <b>braking</b> <b>event</b> was implemented in a moving-base simulator. The effects of FCW, repeated event exposure and initial time headway on driver response times and safety margins were examined. The results showed that the effect of FCW depended strongly on both repeated exposure and initial time headway. In particular, no effects of FCW were found for the first exposure, while strong effects occurred when the scenario was repeated. This was interpreted in terms of a switch from closed-loop responses triggered reactively by the situation, towards an open-loop strategy where subjects with FCW responded proactively directly to the warning. It was also found that initial time headway strongly determined response times in closed-loop conditions but not in open-loop conditions. These results raise a number of methodological issues pertaining to the design of {{experimental studies}} with the aim of evaluating the effects of active safety systems. In particular, the implementation of scenario exposure and criticality must be carefully considered...|$|E

40|$|This thesis work {{conducts a}} study on {{modelling}} car drivers’ start of brake when forward vehicle is stationary or when it is moving with constant velocity. The euroFOT data collected by Volvo Car Corporation in the Gothenburg area of Sweden has been the main data source for modelling purposes. The data segments used consist of <b>braking</b> <b>events</b> where the host vehicle is approaching the forward vehicle. The selection of data segments was further limited by addition of the constraint the forward vehicle has constant velocity or is stationary. A thorough literature investigation recommended several approaches to predict driver’s brake initiation in terms of distance {{as well as other}} perceptual or physical factors that are decisive on driver’s braking behaviour. With the help of previous knowhow, distance to target vehicle at drivers’ brake initiation and inverse time to collision (TTC) approaches have been selected for modelling. Vehicle dynamics related factors such as velocity, acceleration, yaw rate etc. and other factors presented in literature such as reaction time, visual angle, TTC, preferred time headway, preferred distance to vehicle ahead have been subjected to a correlation analysis to identify the significant parameters related to drivers’ braking distance and inverse TTC preference. Single and multiple linear regression analysis have been applied to the combination of selected parameters to establish an equation, which gives the minimum prediction error. Both normal and lognormal values of measured braking distance were used in regression analysis. The results suggested that, for <b>brake</b> <b>events</b> where target vehicle is stationary, the braking distance is best predicted with normal braking distance based modelling. On the contrary, modelling based on lognormal braking distance offered better estimation results for constant target vehicle velocity events. The best population fit and smallest prediction error is resulted with lognormal braking distance based modelling for constant target vehicle velocity condition. Interestingly, the inverse TTC approach provided promising results for the constant target vehicle velocity condition whereas the case for stationary target vehicle, inverse TTC did not lead to strong results. Finally, the study is concluded with various recommendations for possible future investigations...|$|R
