This project {{contains}} a literature review on these organic <b>buildups</b> {{with a focus}} on those occurring in the warm, shallow seas of North America, but also includes a study on organic <b>buildups</b> formed in the cold water region of Russia. The goal {{of the study was to}} characterize these Early Ordovician organic <b>buildups</b> in order to identify similarities and differences in their occurrence. The second part of this project is a preliminary study on organic <b>buildups</b> occurring in the Early Ordovician Garden City Formation in Boss Canyon, Utah. This project found that warm, shallow-water organic <b>buildups</b> of the Early Ordovician were small scale structures that were typically 1 - 3 meters in height and several meters in width, with the length variable depending on location. The organic <b>buildups</b> were biotically relatively simple structures formed by algae, lithistid sponges and Calathium with accessory organisms of brachiopods, cephalopods, trilobites, echinoderms, gastropods, ostracods, algal remains and conodonts. The organic <b>buildups</b> are composed of massive to faintly-laminated mudstone to wackestone to packstone to boundstone. Large in situ organisms are found on the organic <b>buildups,</b> while internally they are found as skeletal components. Rock surrounding the organic <b>buildups</b> includes limestone and shale.

40|$|Abstract. – Within the Upper Albian marl/limestone pelagic to hemi-pelagic {{successions}} of Fahdene basin (northern Tu-nisia), small-scale thrombolitic {{and coral}} <b>buildups</b> were recognized {{for the first}} time. The exceptionally well-exposed and well-preserved <b>buildups</b> (i. e. Oued Siliana and Jebel Srassif <b>buildups)</b> were investigated for their biostratigraphic, petrographic, and genesis character. The vertical succession is characterized as shallowing upward and comprise four to nine conical and/or lenticular bioherms/biostromes (up to 4 m in diameter). Basal <b>buildups</b> consist of four to six deep water microbial thrombolites and are generally associated with the uppermost organic-rich black shale of the Mouelha member which corresponds to the Oceanic Anoxic Event OAE 1 d. These <b>buildups</b> change stratigraphic upward into three hermatypic hexacorallian thrombolites with abundant fossils and bioturbation traces. The geometry and the ob-served internal structures of the thrombolites suggest that microbial activity thrived carbonate precipitation and subse-quent lithification, which in turn favoured preservation of the original structure of the <b>buildups.</b> The microbial thrombolites formed within or near the anoxic zone (related to the Oceanic Anoxic Event OAE 1 d) whereas the coral thrombolites grew in the photic zone. We suggest that {{the onset of the}} microbial thrombolites was induced by the pres-ence of an eutrophic, hypersaline, and anoxic environment which is enhanced by the Late Albian sea level rise. Never-theless, flourishing of metazoans that lead to the coral thrombolites was associated with an oxygenated and oligotrophic environment.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Vermetid <b>buildups,</b> formed {{primarily}} of Dendropoma, {{are found in}} the coastal areas near Bodden Town and Great Bluff Estates on Grand Cayman. These gastropods are commonly encrusted by foraminifera (Homotrema rubum, Acervulina? sp.), coralline algae, and cyanobacteria. Spaces between the gastropods are filled with silt- to sand-sized sediment derived from the nearby lagoon. Bioerosion by echinoids, bivalves, worms, algae, and fungi substantially modified these <b>buildups.</b> C 14 dating of the gastropod shells suggests that the in situ <b>buildups</b> died during the period of 1625 - 1740 AD. The presence of vermetids at these localities on Grand Cayman is not consistent with the high-energy conditions in which these gastropods usually thrive. Today, there are no living vermetids at these localities and the active biological processes are bioerosion and encrustation. The demise of the in situ vermetid <b>buildups</b> during the period of 1625 - 1750 AD may have been related to changes triggered by the Little Ice Age. Alternatively, their demise may have been caused by a change in sea-level or a significant reduction in the wave energy that was impinging on the coastlines...|$|R

40|$|An ancient {{transition}} from shallow marine platform to deep basin is {{preserved in the}} Upper Carboniferous strata of the Sverdrup Basin on northwestern Ellesmere Island. The shelf break is delineated by an approximately 200 km long discontinuous reef tract extending from Audhild Bay {{to the head of}} Hare Fiord within the Nansen Formation. The reef tract is marked by a series of massive, coalesced shelf edge <b>buildups</b> which developed during a major second order regression within the Sverdrup Basin. The shelf edge <b>buildups</b> are largely composed of phylloid alga-rich boundstones with abundant early marine synsedimentary cement. Fenestellid bryozoans, however, dominate <b>buildups</b> that grew in deeper slope settings. Shoreward of the reef tract lie cyclic, shallowing-upward carbonate shelf deposits, also of the Nansen Formation. The outer shelf deposits include bedded oolitic and foraminiferal grainstones representing a shallow water sand apron located immediately behind the reef tract. Basinward of the shelf edge reef tract lie correlative slope-to-basin rhythmic mixed deposits of the Hare Fiord Formation. The upper slope deposits are dominated by fine grained calcisiltites while the lower slope/basin facies comprise calcisiltites, siltstones and shales interbedded with abundant turbidities and debrites. The massive prograding shelf edge <b>buildups</b> reach stratigraphic thicknesses up to 1 km. The Nansen reef tract appears to be a reef complex in which the reefal rim remained relatively deeply submerged, but still within the photic zone, through much of its growth. The carbonate <b>buildups</b> on the shelf, shelf edge and slope all represent potential petroleum-bearing stratigraphic traps within the Sverdrup Basin. If these occur in the subsurface they would be likely exploration targets but unfortunately within the study area little porosity remains.

40|$|ABSTRACT The Pernambuco Basin {{represents}} {{one of the most prominent}} regions for deep water oil and gas exploration off the Brazilian coast. This study aims to identify and describe the occurrence of carbonate <b>buildups</b> in the offshore regions of the basin. The study was based on an analysis of a set of 143 2 D time-migrated seismic sections that cover the offshore region of the Pernambuco Basin. An interpretation of the seismic dataset was used to define the main seismic sequences related to the main regional pulses of deposition and to identify three main groups of carbonate buildups: 1) shelf margin reefs, 2) patch reefs, and 3) isolated carbonate <b>buildups.</b> The carbonate <b>buildups</b> formed in two main intervals during post-rift sequences of the Santonian-Maastrichtian and Paleocene-Middle Miocene, which extend the known periods of carbonate deposit formation in the basin. The formation of carbonate <b>buildups</b> was controlled by the tectonic evolution of the Pernambuco Plateau, which created a series of paleotopographic highs that enabled the establishment of oceanographically and climatically favorable conditions for carbonate formation and deposition. These findings are important for understanding the evolution of the basin and for future evaluations of its petroleum potential...|$|R

40|$|The {{subsurface}} feeder complexes of mud volcanoes and seepage systems potentially {{provide valuable}} {{information on the}} evolution of seepage dynamics. Ancient seepage systems in outcrops allow for the observation of expulsion features, which are otherwise commonly beyond seismic resolution. In the Maiella hydrocarbon seep area, the evolution of fluid migration through the sedimentary column during the Messinian Salinity Crisis generated distinctive seep-plumbing features, geological responses, and geochemical signatures in the “Brecciated Limestones” unit. The fluid migration pathways evolved from funnel-shaped feeder channels (Flow-mobilized Sediments) into hydrofractured microbial carbonate <b>buildups</b> (Limestone <b>Buildups),</b> and finally into blow-out micropipes in the host sediment (Patchy Limestones), as overpressure dissipated through the plumbing system. The Flow-mobilized Sediments (δ 13 C down to − 24. 5 ‰ PDB- 1) correspond to the highest flow rates in the whole area, whereas the Patchy Limestones (δ 13 C down to − 39. 3 ‰ PDB- 1) correspond to the slowest flow rates within the intrusive zone. The Limestone <b>Buildups</b> show different degrees of hydrofracturing that reflect different flow rates (δ 13 C down to − 27. 5 ‰ PDB- 1). The fluid transport mechanisms evolved from focused venting through neoformed feeder channels, where sediments elutriated from depths were carried out (the sediment-prone response to fluid migration), to high-rate seepage triggering high hydrofracturation in the microbial <b>buildups.</b> While the hydrocarbon-rich fluids contemporaneously triggered authigenic precipitation (the mineral-prone response to fluid migration), progressive upward and lateral flow deceleration resulted in gradually weaker hydrofracturing of the microbial <b>buildups</b> and finally only local cementation in the form of carbonate patches within the host sediments...|$|R

40|$|Cenozoic zooxanthellate corals are {{commonly}} considered to form framework‐dominated <b>buildups</b> in shallow‐, well‐illuminated (euphotic) and oligotrophic conditions. In contrast, detailed outcrop study and facies‐component analysis show that Eocene non‐framework coral <b>buildups</b> also developed in turbid, oligophotic (poorly illuminated) and nutrient‐rich conditions. The study area {{is located in}} the South‐Central Pyrenean Zone (Jaca Basin). Here, middle to upper Eocene prodelta clay/marl succession passes, up‐section, into prograding delta‐front sandstones and, subsequently, into continental sandstones and conglomerates. Coral‐rich lithosomes occur in {{the upper part of the}} clay/marls succession and are completely encased in clay. Within coral <b>buildups,</b> facies consist of: 1) coral boundstone with different coral growth fabrics (platestone and domestone, and subordinate pillarstone and mixstone) and abundant red algae, in a mud‐dominated matrix; 2) well‐sorted fine‐grained or poorly‐sorted coarse‐grained skeletal packstones with abundant coral fragments, red algae, bryozoans, benthonic foraminifers and rare planktonic foraminifers, locally rich in larger benthic foraminifers and siliciclastic sand; 3) red‐algae‐rich coral rudstone with pack‐wackestone matrix; 4) bryozoan floatstone in a mud‐ dominated matrix. These carbonate lithofacies pass, laterally and vertically into 4) thinly laminated clay to marls with interbedded sandstone beds. Coral boundstone, and associated packstone and rudstone wedges, form single bioherms and discrete biostromes (1 ‐ 8 m thick) that stack into larger carbonate <b>buildups,</b> commonly 20 ‐ 30 ‐m thick, with some up to 50 ‐m thick. Facies associations, textures and photo‐dependent components indicate these <b>buildups</b> to have grown in the oligophotic‐ (lithofacies 1, 2 and 3) and aphotic (lithofacies 4) zones, and in low energy conditions below fair‐weather wave base, where they were only occasionally hit by storms. Dominance of corals and bryozoans (plankton catchers) over sponges and mollusks (plankton pumpers) indicates predominance of phyto‐ and zooplankton over picoplankton, which suggest mesotrophic conditions. Our results highlight the contrast with present‐day “classic” reef models, and suggests that by the late Eocene reef coral assemblages where able to thrive in low‐light, low‐energy, turbid and nutrient‐rich conditions.

Geochemical data alone cannot be used to demonstrate conclusively {{the origin of the}} mud comprising the <b>buildups,</b> but an in situ source and early cementation can be inferred from morphology, internal architecture, and sedimentary structures. Morphological types vary from symmetrical mounds up to 12 m high to asymmetrical pinnacles that locally coalesced, forming elongate multicored complexes up to 56 m high. Their steep-sided nature (margins dipping up to 54 °) and sporadic occurrence of erect invertebrates suggest localized production of mud rather than hydrodynamic piling or baffling from suspension. Irregular nodular beds that thicken internally imply centralized production and a local source for the mud.
