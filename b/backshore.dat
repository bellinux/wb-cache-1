40|$|This note {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} on production <b>backshoring</b> – the move-ment of production activities from locations abroad {{back to the}} home country. Between 2010 and Mid- 2012, only four percent of all firms moved production activities back to their home country. For every <b>backshoring</b> firm, {{there are more than}} three offshoring firms. Thus, from today’s perspective it is unlikely that <b>backshoring</b> will be an important driver of a ‘manufacturing renaissance’ in Europe. The most frequent reason for <b>backshoring</b> is poor quality of the goods pro-duced at foreign locations, followed by the loss of flexibility and too high transport costs. Sectors with a high <b>backshoring</b> propensity are electrical equipment, communications equipment and the automotive industry. These sectors may be the most obvious candidates for policy intervention to increase the frequency of <b>backshoring</b> in European manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} the adequacy of the present theoretical knowledge relating to divestments and de-internationalization in the context of explaining the <b>backshoring</b> phenomenon – a relatively new, but gaining in importance specific behaviour of companies in the process of internationalization. Research Design & Methods: The paper discusses various aspects of contemporary processes of internationalization. The employed research design is qualitative – the study has been based on conclusions drawn from critical literature studies. Findings: Although <b>backshoring</b> shares some common characteristics with the concepts of de-internationalization and international divestments, there are several noticeable differences: e. g. both de-internationalization and international divestments are rather related to wholly owned subsidiaries, while <b>backshoring</b> includes both activities outsourced to company’s foreign suppliers and to its subsidiaries. Implications & Recommendations: It is necessary to develop new concepts that in a holistic way will define the decision-making process of enterprises which use de-internationalization and <b>backshoring</b> of business processes as part of their long-term internationalization strategies. The article indicates some dependencies and issues that must be considered in formulating new theoretical proposals.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{empirical}} investigation of recent trends and changes in companies' production relocation and <b>backshoring</b> behaviour against the background of the global economic crisis. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical research is based on a large data set of 1, 484 German manufacturing companies as part of the European Manufacturing Survey (EMS). The paper employs a structured set of probit analyses to identify the differences of production relocation and <b>backshoring</b> determinants before and within the crisis. Findings - Against common belief the paper finds that not only the relocation of production to emerging countries, but also the <b>backshoring</b> of once offshored manufacturing capacities to the home base is a relevant phenomenon. Since the emergence of the global economic crisis, relocation activities declined significantly, whereas the level of <b>backshoring</b> activities has remained stable. Far-shore destinations in Asia gain in attractiveness over near-shore locations in Eastern Europe. Particularly export-intensive companies tended recently towards (re-) concentrating of their production capacities, trying to exploit the benefits of higher capacity utilisation and a superior relation of variable costs to fix costs at their existing locations. Research limitations/implications - Although covering a significant range of industrial sectors in Germany, more empirical evidence is needed from other branches and countries. Looking forward it is proposed to systemically integrate scenarios on the future development of the most influential environmental factors in future research frameworks for global production decisions and value chains. Practical implications - The findings strongly recommend a revision of established decision-making schemes for production relocations based on pure cost efficiency considerations. Decision-making should integrate qualitative environmental factors and dynamic considerations using scenario-based tools. Companies need to understand and prepare for dynamic developments at different locations which can strategically necessitate <b>backshoring</b> after a certain time. Originality/value - The research considerably widens the empirical knowledge on recent trends in relocation activities and their inherent risks, which in a dynamic perspective are sometimes forcing <b>backshoring</b> activities...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 1990 s many German {{companies}} have relocated parts of their production abroad (offshoring). This development has been caused on the one hand by innovations in information and communication technologies that are supported by the liberalization of the international trade, {{and on the other hand}} by the reduction of transportation costs due to technological development. Through relocation, companies can benefit from the country-specific institutions. Further, they can also improve their cost structure and their market position. However the offshoring decision is, in addition to the wage differentials and the country-specific factors, also influenced by the characteristics of the production processes. So far, this fact has been considered only in theoretical approaches. The relocation of parts of the production chain abroad is not an irreversible process. Thus, since the end of the 1990 s, a new trend can be observed, namely the return back to the domestic country (<b>backshoring).</b> Pre-existing studies see <b>backshoring</b> mainly as a “failure” of the foreign investment, supposedly conditioned by an overhasty and biased offshoring decision. However, this negative view of <b>backshoring</b> neglects the fact that business environments are changeable over time, so that under the changed circumstances it can be more beneficial to produce in the domestic country again. Furthermore, pre-existing surveys fail to consider the impact of the characteristics of the production chain on the <b>backshoring</b> activities of companies. An econometric estimation of this correlation also seems to be missing. On the basis of the introduced research gaps, the goal of this doctoral thesis is to empirically estimate the factors of offshoring and <b>backshoring</b> for German industrial firms. The focus of the research is therefore on the characteristics of the production chain and their impact on the offshoring and <b>backshoring</b> activities of German companies. In order to examine the effect of production-specific factors on the choice of production location, a survey of German firms has been conducted, and the collected specific enterprise data is used for the empirical estimations...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1960 ’s, {{companies}} have searched for competitive advantage from offshoring their manufacturing processes to countries of lower labour cost, or {{countries that are}} located closer to interesting markets. However, since about 2005, the trend has partly reversed: large amounts of offshoring projects face unprecedented costs and setbacks, making domestic production more favourable again. The reasons for both offshoring and <b>backshoring</b> of production have been studied in detail, but little focus {{has been given to}} how those decisions unfold day by day in the board rooms. In this study, three case companies, one offshoring case and two <b>backshoring</b> cases, were interviewed to find out how manufacturing relocation decisions are really made. The investigation was divided into four major sub-questions: how could the case decisions processes be modelled; {{what is the role of}} management accounting information in those decisions; what factors affect the risk perceptions of decision makers, and; how could the decision making processes be improved. It was found that offshoring and <b>backshoring</b> decisions are very different by nature due to the differences in uncertainty that the decision makers have to deal with. The myriad of options and factors present in choosing an offshore location from anywhere in the world translates into huge information and accounting needs, as well as complex decision making processes including several nested subdecisions. Meanwhile <b>backshoring</b> decisions were found to be very straightforward, less reliant on large amounts of accounting information and less time consuming to implement. This is due to the fact that these decisions usually consider only two locations, the offshored and the domestic location, both of which are well known and measured. The case companies were also asked to determine what parts of the decisions they would want to improve the most. The high level conclusion is that companies that seek global success should remain extra vigilant of the immense complexity of these decisions, and that there is a clear need to quantify and concretify the benefits of domestic production, such as quality, flexibility and trust between suppliers and partners...|$|R
40|$|Defined {{as local}} {{manufacturing}} systems, industrial districts have been recog- nized as {{particularly important for}} the location of firms’ manufacturing activities intertwined with innovation processes. The debate on the interna- tionalization of production has stressed the low value related to manufactur- ing within value chain activities (smile framework), emphasizing the {{need to focus on}} high value-added activities (R&D or marketing). Following multi- national enterprises’ internationalization strategies, also district firms have progressively offshored their production phases in the past years. However, recent studies focused on <b>backshoring</b> have revamped the attention on the domestic control of production for firms’ competitiveness. This chapter explores district firms’ location choices for manufacturing activities between local and global. Based on an empirical analysis of about 260 Italian district firms specialized in mechanics, furniture, and fashion and supported by a case study investigation, our results show that despite district internationali- zation processes, a non-negligible amount of firms still carry out in-house or through outsourcing production activities at district level. Larger firms couple district production and long-term upstream outsourced internationali- zation activities. The district system confirms its role of pooling specialized competences and product know-how, being decisive for firms’ innovation and responsiveness to national and international markets. <b>Backshoring,</b> instead, is a very limited phenomenon and linked to upgrading strategies...|$|R

In addition many coastal aboriginal middens were disturbed by such events. Within estuaries, tsunamis have left a record of stranded run-up ridges which have been interrupted mistakenly as cheniers. Dating of such deposits indicates that several events have affected this coastline since 3000 BP. In contrast to storm waves, tsunamis can leave a depositional imprint of their passage that is characterized by chaotic sorting and mixing of sediments either from different coastal environments or of different sediment sizes.

Site 2 is located at a beach ridge, specifically its crest, 18 meters inland from the shore-face.|$|E
50|$|The shoreface is {{the part}} of the barrier where the ocean meets the shore of the island.

Characteristics common to the lower shoreface are fine sands with mud and possibly silt. Further out into the ocean the sediment becomes finer.

5000|$|The shoreface (or {{underwater}} platform) on flat coasts encompasses in {{its narrow}} sense that area which {{is subject to}} the constant action of moving water. This means that the landward boundary between shoreface and beach is the line of the average low-water mark. However this definition is not universal and frequently varies from author to author in the literature. Whilst some define the beach as the landward transition to the shoreface that extends from the low-water mark to the highest high-water mark, i.e. the zone that is only periodically or episodically (after a storm surge) flooded by water; other authors do not use the term [...] "beach" [...] for the landward element of a flat coast at all. They describe the region between the mean low-water mark and the mean high-water mark of the tides as the intertidal zone or foreshore and that area above the average high-water mark as the supratidal zone or <b>backshore</b> that is only directly attacked by water during storms. Because the <b>backshore</b> is often considerably flatter in appearance than the foreshore, which slopes clearly down towards the sea, it is also often referred to as a beach platform, which is why this part of the shore can be considered in practice to be the actual beach. The farthest point inland that is reached by storm surges is bounded by a belt of dunes, where floods can form a dune cliff.|$|E
40|$|Plastic {{pollution}} in the Laurentian Great Lakes is becoming a significant environmental concern with the threats of species entanglement, adsorption of toxins such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and persistent organic molecules (POPs), and subsequent ingestion. Lake Erie tributary (by Petite Ponar), beach (by Split Spoon sampler), and benthic sediments (by Shipek grabs) were collected and evaluated for microplastic particles (0. 5 mm) (by quadrats and transects). These results were mapped using ArcGIS software to show distribution and abundance in regards to quaternary watershed population density and plastic industrial plants, manufacturers, and distributors. Tributaries in urban areas were more abundant in microplastics than in more rural tributaries. At beaches, <b>backshores</b> were more abundant in microplastics than in the foreshore, likely due to natural beach dynamics of sediment accumulation. The greatest abundance of microplastics {{was found in the}} Western Basin of Lake Erie, where the Detroit River drains into the lake. Quaternary watersheds borderingLake Eriewith higher population densities were most abundant in microplastic and macroplastic pollution. Macroplastics were most abundant at beaches in highly populated areas, and macroplastics were least abundant at beaches that were part of conservation areas. A random selection of microplastic fragments and microbeads were analysed using Nicolet Almega Dispersive Raman Spectroscopy and NXR FT-Raman Spectroscopy to determine types of plastics. Polyethylene was the most common microplastic observed among this sample selection. Overall, high population density around the sampling locations correlated to a higher abundance in plastic debris. Conservation areas had the lowest abundance of plastic debris; therefore, employing conservation area environmental practices could be beneficial to reducing plastic debris at other locations along Lake Erie...|$|R
40|$|Information {{technology}} (IT) offshoring is {{an increasingly}} important strategic tool for firms. Although offshoring activities have led to significant cost savings in many cases, a critical concern is that as IT work moves offshore the deep, experiential knowledge will also move offshore. This knowledge loss may leave the domestic firm with a smaller pool of candidates vying for upper-level management jobs, leading to a future disruption in the management supply chain. In this dissertation three models are developed to investigate how the offshoring of IT activities may affect the domestic firm's knowledge level {{and as a result}} the costs of IT work. In the first model the impact of critical model parameters on the offshoring costs is investigated under the assumption that the offshoring rate is fixed. Although short-lived offshoring projects may generate substantial cost savings, long-lived offshoring projects may cause a disruption in the management supply chain, resulting in substantial cost increases. Under some conditions the domestic firm may be locked into an agreement where the <b>backshoring</b> decision becomes economically infeasible. In the second model, the domestic firm is allowed to make the offshoring rate decision. In this case the domestic firm may "steal" learning-by-doing knowledge from the foreign firm with a very low offshoring rate when the knowledge transfer rate is assumed to be constant. This "discontinuity" in knowledge transfer results in a "bang-bang" solution for the offshoring rate. Depending on the level of the disruption in the management supply chain the domestic firm should choose either very small offshoring or full offshoring. In response, it may be in the foreign firm's interest to contract a minimum offshoring rate. The impacts of assuming the knowledge transfer rate as a proportionally increasing function of the offshoring rate is also examined. In this case the middle range offshoring rates are viable solutions for the domestic firm. In the last model, the impact of allowing the domestic firm the real option to alter the offshoring rate is examined. This flexibility provides value in the mid ranges of the disruption of the management supply chain...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{the result}} of an archaeological survey of numerous areas of the coast of south Argyll, Scotland, originally designed to seek evidence for Early Medieval maritime trade. The intertidal foreshores and immediate <b>backshores</b> of areas considered likely centers of Early Medieval activity were examined for artifacts and features through pedestrian survey; aeolian sands associated with these areas were also investigated. Areas for survey were {{selected on the basis of}} known archaeological remains; placenames; and the presence of beaches, harbors, or other possible maritime amenities. ^ While the fieldwork did not discover any artifacts or features that could be unequivocally assigned to the Early Medieval period, it did recover a broad range of artifacts ranging from the Mesolithic to the early twentieth century AD from these coastal contexts. A significant number of maritime features such as jetties, clearways, wrecks, and fishtraps were recorded as well. Since the archaeology of coastal environments beyond the Mesolithic is only just becoming an area of interest and concern within the discipline, the topic of this dissertation was shifted to examine the maritime cultural landscape of south Argyll across a broader chronological range. ^ The Mesolithic was well-represented among the collections, of course, and significant quantities of unworked flint, which would have been a valuable resource in prehistory, were found in south Kintyre and the Rhinns of Islay. Artifacts from later prehistory had a more restricted distribution, coming almost entirely from the aeolian sands of the north Rhinns of Islay. Identifiably Medieval artifacts consisted of only two sherds of pottery found in the vicinity of castles of that period. The bulk of the collection consisted of eighteenth-twentieth-century AD ceramics and glass, whose distribution reflects domestic refuse disposal and the recreational use of the shore. This period has not received much attention in Scottish archaeology, and despite its lack of precise context, the collection provides a valuable insight into the material culture of this region during this time. ...|$|R
