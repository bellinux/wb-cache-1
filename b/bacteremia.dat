5|$|S. iniae {{can cause}} {{opportunistic}} infections in weakened or immunocompromised humans. It is most {{commonly associated with}} bacteremic cellulitis, but {{has been known to}} cause endocarditis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. The first recognized cases of human infection occurred in Texas in 1991 and in Ottawa in 1994, but the sources of infection were not determined. Human infection with S.iniae was also identified in Toronto between 15 and 20 December 1995, when three Asian patients were admitted to a hospital with cellulitis of the hand after injuring themselves while handling raw fish. All three were found to have <b>bacteremia,</b> initially attributed to Streptococcus uberis, but later correctly identified as S.iniae. In February 1996, a Chinese man was admitted to the same hospital with sepsis one week after preparing a fresh whole tilapia, and was also diagnosed with S.iniae <b>bacteremia.</b> A subsequent epidemiological investigation found other cases in the Toronto area, for a total of nine patients; all were of Asian descent and all had handled raw fish (mostly tilapia) before developing infection. Other cases were later identified in the United States and elsewhere in Canada, and have since been reported in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore). Asian descent is a common trend in the majority of invasive human cases, but it is unknown whether this is due to inherent differences in immunity or because of cultural differences in the fish preparation which lend themselves to a higher incidence of infection.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with the}} blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in <b>bacteremia</b> (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E

Symptoms may include fatigue, headaches, fever, memory loss, disorientation, insomnia, and loss of coordination. The bacteria block the normal immune response by suppressing the NF-κB apoptosis pathway. Disease progression may be accelerated if the host is subsequently infected by an immune-suppressing virus such as Epstein Barr virus.|$|E

40|$|We studied 622 transplants {{undertaken}} between 1982 and 2001 to: (1) {{determine the}} incidence, timing and etiology of <b>bacteremias,</b> and (2) examine {{the ability of}} routine surveillance cultures to predict <b>bacteremias.</b> A total of 404 episodes (0. 65 episode per patient) occurred in 248 patients, due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (n= 171, 42 %), Gram-negative bacteria (n= 129, 32 %), streptococci (n= 48, 12 %), other Gram-positive bacteria (n= 33, 8 %), anaerobes (n= 9, 2 %) and fungi (n= 14, 3 %). <b>Bacteremias</b> were more frequent in allogeneic (0. 96 episode/patient) compared to autologous (0. 44) transplants (P< 0. 0001). The overall incidence decreased from 0. 92 episode/patient until 1990 to 0. 66 in 1991 - 1996 and 0. 55 in 1997 - 2001 (P< 0. 0001), but this was only observed in autologous transplants. Among them, 212 (53 %) occurred before hospital discharge and 192 (47 %) thereafter.

In conclusion: (1) <b>bacteremias</b> remain a frequent complication, particularly in allogeneic transplantation, even long after hospital discharge; (2) routine surveillance cultures can predict <b>bacteremias</b> in 50 % of the cases, but the practical impact of this observation is limited {{in view of the}} costs.

25|$|The {{manipulation}} of the gut microbiota is complex and may cause bacteria-host interactions. Although probiotics {{are considered to be}} safe, there are concerns about their safety in certain cases. Some people, such as those with immunodeficiency, short bowel syndrome, central venous catheters, cardiac valve disease and premature infants, may be at higher risk for adverse events. In severely ill people with inflammatory bowel disease there is a risk of the passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the internal organs (bacterial translocation) as a consequence of <b>bacteremia,</b> which can cause adverse health consequences. Rarely, consumption of probiotics by children with lowered immune system function or who are already critically ill may result in <b>bacteremia</b> or fungemia (i.e., bacteria or fungi in the blood), which can lead to sepsis, a potentially fatal disease.|$|E

40|$|Two hundred subclavian {{dialysis}} catheters {{were placed}} in 148 patients who kept them {{in place for a}} total of 2, 798 days. Catheterization time ranged from 1 to 79 days with an average of 14. 0 +/- 1. 0 days per catheter and 18. 9 +/- 1. 0 days per patient. Twenty nine catheters were infected, 17 of which were the source of <b>bacteremias</b> due to Staphylococcus epidermidis in 13 cases and to Staphylococcus aureus in 4 cases. The incidence of sepsis was not significantly greater in diabetic patients, in patients with corticotherapy or in patients presenting an underlying systemic disease. On the contrary, the incidence was greater in hospitalized patients (15 <b>bacteremias</b> during 1, 948 catheter days) than in ambulatory patients (2 <b>bacteremias</b> during 850 catheters-days) as well as during a period corresponding to a greater number of untrained nurses enrolled in the dialysis team. During this period, 6 sepsies occurred in 19 catheters (other periods: 7 sepsies/ 116 catheters, p less than 0. 01). 6 of 28 nurses had less than 3 months of professional experience (other periods: 1 of 25, p less than 0. 01).

40|$|Objectives: Infections are {{the major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). They primarily occur during the first course of induction chemotherapy and may increase the risk of leukaemia relapse, due to a significant delay in consolidation therapy. The intensification of induction chemotherapy and the use of non-conventional drugs such as fludarabine are considered responsible for the increased risk of infections. Methods: In this study, we retrospectively analysed the infections occurred in 224 newly diagnosed AML patients ≤ 65 yr, consecutively treated between 1997 and 2002 with an induction regimen including fludarabine, arabinosyl cytosine and idarubicin, with or without etoposide (FLAI/FLAIE), in the context of three multicentric prospective trials (AML 97, AML 99, AML 02). Results: During the induction phase, 146 (65 %) patients experienced fever of undetermined origin (FUO), 30 (13 %) and 47 (21 %) patients had Gram-negative and positive <b>bacteremias,</b> respectively, and 10 (4 %) patients developed a probable/proven invasive fungal infection (IFI). The fatality rate for Gram-negative, Gram-positive <b>bacteremias</b> and probable/proven IFI was 10 %, 8 % and 60 % respectively. During consolidation, 75 (35 %) patients had FUO, 43 (20 %) and 40 (19 %) patients had Gram-negative and positive <b>bacteremias,</b> respectively, and 5 (2 %) patients developed a probable/proven IFI. The fatality rate for Gram-negative, Gram-positive <b>bacteremias</b> and probable/proven IFI was 14 %, 5 % and 80 % respectively. Interestingly, the overall incidence of microbiologically documented infections during induction was 38 % and the incidence of probable/proven IFIs during the induction/consolidation programme was 7 %. No infections caused by viruses or opportunistic pathogens were observed neither during induction, nor during consolidation. Conclusions: These data, although retrospectively collected, suggest that fludarabine-based chemotherapy is not associated with an increased incidence of infections, in particular IFIs, compared to conventional regimens commonly used for AML induction...|$|R

Antibiotics are administered to patients with certain heart conditions as a precaution, although this practice has changed in the US, with new American Heart Association guidelines released in 2007, and in the UK as of March 2008 due to new NICE guidelines.
