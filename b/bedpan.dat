500|$|Mercy Point also {{garnered}} {{negative reactions}} from television critics, with GamesRadar's Dave Golder including {{it on his}} list of the worst science fiction and fantasy television shows of all time for its [...] "rite, obvious and cheesy" [...] storylines. The Los Angeles Times' Howard Rosenberg criticized the show's reliance on its science-fiction context and technology to distract the viewers from [...] "its mustiness and lack of originality". Even though Rosenberg felt the show's concept had potential and found Batung to an intriguing character, he advised the audience to [...] "change this <b>bedpan</b> fast". Lee Sandlin of The Chicago Reader included Mercy Point in his assessment of the worst television shows in the 1998–1999 season, criticizing its lack of originality and poor writing. The series was heavily panned by Kevin Wagner of the science-fiction online magazine The Sci-Fi Guys, who found the pilot's story arc to be uninteresting {{and the use of}} rubber gloves as a way for advanced containment to be unrealistic.The Sun-Sentinels Hal Boedeker cited Mercy Point and The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer as [...] "misbegotten fare" [...] that alienated its audience and lowered viewership by forty percent.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes {{urination}} {{is done in}} {{a container}} such as a bottle, urinal, <b>bedpan,</b> or chamber pot (also known as a [...] ). A container may be used so that the urine can be examined for medical reasons or for a drug test, for a bedridden patient, when no toilet is available, or {{there is no other}} possibility to dispose of the urine immediately.|$|E
2500|$|Most of Book II of the Dunciad B is {{the same}} as Dunciad A. [...] The Dunce Games are largely the same, with a few changes in personnel. Cibber watches all, with [...] "A brain of feathers, and a heart of lead" [...] (II 44). The contest of booksellers is {{generally}} as it was in 1727, with Curll slipping on <b>bedpan</b> slops.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} tests of {{cleaning}} and disinfection of stainless steel <b>bedpans</b> which have been coated with either a silicone grease or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The coatings were applied manually using an aerosol spray (silicone grease and PTFE), and by an industrial process (PTFE). Soils used comprised (i) British Standard Soil (B. S., 1966), (ii) human serum albumin labelled with technetium- 99 m (HSA-Tc), and (iii) a suspension of Streptococcus faecalis in broth. Tests of {{cleaning and disinfection}} were carried out in automatic washing and steam disinfector machines. Results show that aerosol spraying impairs the cleaning process but that <b>bedpans</b> coated by the industrial process with PTFE are superior to uncoated <b>bedpans...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Pope's friend John Gay also {{adapted the}} {{pastoral}}. [...] Gay, working at Pope's suggestion, wrote {{a parody of}} the updated pastoral in The Shepherd's Week. He also imitated the Satires of Juvenal with his Trivia. [...] In 1728, his The Beggar's Opera was an enormous success, running for an unheard-of eighty performances. [...] All of these works have in common a gesture of compassion. [...] In Trivia, Gay writes as if commiserating with {{those who live in}} London and are menaced by falling masonry and <b>bedpan</b> slops, and The Shepherd's Week features great detail of the follies of everyday life and eccentric character. [...] Even The Beggar's Opera, which is a satire of Robert Walpole, portrays its characters with compassion: the villains have pathetic songs in their own right and are acting out of exigency rather than boundless evil.|$|E
2500|$|Mobility is {{severely}} restricted by the hip spica cast and walking without crutches or a walker is impossible because the hips cannot bend. There {{is a serious}} danger of falling if the patient in a hip spica cast tries to get upright to walk without assistance because they lack {{the ability to control}} their balance. Patients are normally confined to a bed or reclining wheelchair, or children's stroller. Children in spica casts can sometimes learn to get mobile by scooting around on skateboards, or pulling themselves across the floor. Some children even learn to walk by holding themselves up against furniture. A child in a spica cast must always be supervised and safety must always be considered when they are at a mobile phase of their healing to prevent reinjury or damage to the cast. Many spica casts have a spreader bar between the legs to help strengthen the cast and support the legs in the proper positions. It is important when moving the casted patient to not lift them by this spreader bar, as it may break and this could cause injury to the patient. To facilitate toileting or diaper changing and hygienic cleaning, an opening is created in the cast at the groin. The opening is normally referred to as the [...] "perineal opening". It is formed either during cast application or after cast application by cutting the hole with the cast saw. The opening must then be petalled or lined to keep this area of the cast clean and dry. Because the hips cannot bend, using a toilet is difficult, if not impossible. It is therefore necessary for the patient to either use a diaper, <b>bedpan,</b> or catheters to manage bodily waste eliminations. Bathing must be done by sponge baths. Hair may be shampooed by using plastic wash basins under the head. To shampoo wash the hair of a child, the child can be lifted and placed on a kitchen counter top and their head held over the kitchen sink.|$|E
50|$|If {{the patient}} is using a <b>bedpan,</b> the nursing staff member who empties the <b>bedpan</b> {{measures}} the urine prior to its disposal.|$|E
50|$|Some {{patients}} {{are able to}} place their own <b>bedpans</b> under themselves, and assistance is required only to empty them after the fact.|$|R

40|$|A system using {{disposable}} papier maché <b>bedpans</b> and urinals {{in hospital}} has advantages of ease of handling for the nurse and cleanliness for the patient. Disposal of the <b>bedpans</b> and their contents is by destruction and flushing to waste. Some bacteriological hazards {{of this process}} in the Haigh Sluicemaster and J. M. L. Clinimatic machines are assessed, particularly the dispersal of the contents in spray and aerosol during opening, closing, and running the machines. Various safety devices were tested and some deficiencies are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Patients who cannot {{get out of}} bed easily but who {{can control}} their bladder and bowels are able to request a <b>bedpan.</b> The <b>bedpan</b> is placed {{underneath}} the patient, who can urinate or defecate as needed.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bedpan</b> or bed pan is a {{receptacle}} {{used for}} the toileting of a bedridden patient in a health care facility, and is usually made of metal, glass, ceramic, or plastic. A <b>bedpan</b> {{can be used for}} both urinary and fecal discharge. Many diseases can confine a patient to bed, necessitating the use of bedpans, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and dementia. Additionally, many patients may be confined to a bed temporarily {{as a result of a}} temporary illness, injury, or surgery, thereby necessitating the use of a <b>bedpan.</b>|$|E
50|$|In recent years, a <b>bedpan</b> liner made of {{recycled}} wood pulp (molded pulp) is more popular in UK hospitals; {{it is for}} single use, decreasing the risk of cross-contamination diseases. An alternative to the recycled pulp liner is the plastic <b>bedpan</b> liner, which also creates a barrier between the waste and the <b>bedpan.</b> Some liners are made of biodegradable plastic and contain absorbent powder to eliminate splashing and spills. Liners are used in hospitals to decrease infection, and can also be purchased and used for home health care.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bedpans</b> {{are usually}} {{constructed}} of stainless steel, which {{is easy to}} clean and durable, but may be cold, hard, and uncomfortable to use. Also, the supporting area of some products is very small, and prolonged use can cause [...] pressure ulcers. To solve these problems, new ergonomic <b>bedpans</b> have been developed, which support the patient with a larger area of warm plastic. Some designs completely cover the genitalia during use, offering protection and an extra measure of privacy. On the other hand, the material {{is more difficult to}} sterilize, and may become a reservoir for microorganisms.|$|R
50|$|Because of its {{ammonium}} content lant {{was most}} commonly used for floor cleaning and laundry. According to early housekeeping guides <b>bedpans</b> would be collected {{by one of the}} younger male servants and put away to ferment to a mildly caustic before use.|$|R
50|$|Class I devices present minimal {{potential}} for {{harm to the}} user and are often simpler in design than Class II or Class III devices. Devices in this category include tongue depressors, <b>bedpans,</b> elastic bandages, examination gloves, and hand-held surgical instruments and other similar types of common equipment.|$|R

50|$|Fracture bedpans {{are smaller}} than {{standard}} size bedpans, and have one flat end. These bedpans are designed specifically for patients {{who have had a}} hip fracture or are recovering from hip replacement. This type of <b>bedpan</b> may be used for those patients who cannot raise their hips high enough or roll over onto a regular size <b>bedpan.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>bedpan</b> is {{used for}} bed bound {{patients}} for bowel elimination as well urinary elimination for females. Powder is often placed along the ring of the <b>bedpan</b> to help reduce friction but is avoided if contraindicated by issues like allergies or if a stool sample is needed. Raising {{the head of the}} bead assists in voiding or defecating.|$|E
50|$|The Hall China Company {{was founded}} by Robert Hall in East Liverpool, Ohio, United States in August 1903 {{following}} {{the dissolution of the}} two-year-old East Liverpool Potteries Company. He began making dinnerware and toilet seats, but soon found that institutional ware such as <b>bedpans,</b> chamber pots and pitchers was more profitable.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the serious}} {{nature of this}} procedure, {{recovery}} may be extensive. Careful consultation with a physician is important {{in order to ensure}} proper planning during a recovery phase. Tools exist to assist recovering patients who may have non weight bearing requirements and include <b>bedpans,</b> dressing sticks, long-handled shoe-horns, grabbers/reachers and specialized walkers and wheelchairs.|$|R
50|$|In California, {{licensed}} vocational nurses (LVNs) empty <b>bedpans,</b> commodes {{and clean}} and change incontinent adults. Licensed vocational nurses read vital signs such as pulse, temperature, blood pressure and respiration. They administer injections and enemas, monitor catheters and give massages or alcohol rubs. They may apply dressings, hot water bottles and ice packs. They help patients bathe and dress, treat bedsores and change soiled bed sheets. LVNs feed patients and record their food consumption, while monitoring the fluids they take in and excrete.|$|R

A doctor was sent for, and Roosevelt was diagnosed with poliomyelitis. Howe remained by Roosevelt's bedside throughout {{the early days of}} his illness, cheering him up, tending to his needs, and even changing his <b>bedpans.</b> By September of that year, Howe had been formally invited to join the Roosevelt household, and began visiting his own family only on weekends.|$|R
40|$|The {{challenge}} {{to a government}} in establishing a system of controls over medical devices is to protect patients but without unduly impeding innovation or driving up product costs. Medical devices are, essentially, health care products other than pharmaceuticals. * Medical devices comprise a diverse array of products ranging from simple items like bandages and <b>bedpans</b> to complex products like pacemakers and other implants. Accordingly, the level of control needed to protect patients can range from minimal, for low-risk products, to a more protective level, for those high risk products that need testing and third-party review before entering general use...|$|R
5000|$|A {{hospital}} warehouse is {{a department}} {{in a hospital}} where medical supplies are stored. Such supplies include intravenous (IV) solutions and tubings, first aid products (band aids, wound dressings, gauze, etc.), protective equipment (gloves, gowns, masks, etc.), personal care products/toiletries (wash basins, <b>bedpans,</b> diapers, shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste, toothbrushes, patient belonging bags, drinking cups, etc.), feeding tubes, foley catheters, respiratory supplies and orthopedic supplies (crutches, arm slings, splints, etc.). Items in the warehouse may be distributed to various departments within the hospital (such as the emergency room, operating room, intensive-care unit, etc.), through a centralized requisition system which determines what supplies are needed and the amount to each department.|$|R
50|$|A urinal is {{much like}} a <b>bedpan</b> {{but only for a}} male, the urinal is shaped {{in a way that the}} male may use it while still in bed and remain comfortable. The urinal is also often used when input and output (I & O) must be recorded.|$|E

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of gentamicin- and tobramycin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection {{occurred in a}} surgical ward over a three-month period. Resistant Ps. aeruginosa strains with the same serological, phage, and pyocin type were cultured from the urine of six patients. Identical organisms were found on urine bottles, <b>bedpans,</b> and the hands of attendant staff. Inadequate disinfection {{played a major role}} in cross-infection. Isolates of the epidemic strain from each of the patients and of an unrelated but similarly resistant Ps. aeruginosa from one of them could transfer resistance to a recipient strain of Ps. aeruginosa. Resistance to gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin, sulphonamides, and mercuric chloride was determined by R factors belonging to Pseudomonas incompatibility group P- 3. Aminoglycoside resistance was due to acetylation...|$|R
