40|$|We {{describe}} the clinical and immunopathological findings {{in a patient}} with a <b>bullous</b> <b>eruption</b> and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The <b>bullous</b> <b>eruption</b> preceded a dramatic flare of the SLE with a rise in anticardiolipin antibodies and life-threatening cardiac vasculitis. The clinical and histological findings {{were similar to those}} described in the classic <b>bullous</b> <b>eruption</b> of SLE but, unlike previous cases, IgG anti-basement-membrane-zone (anti-BMZ) antibodies were detected on the epidermal as well as the dermal side of the split in chemically separated human skin. We screened the sera of another eight patients with SLE and 10 patients with chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE) without evidence of systemic involvement for the presence of anti-BMZ antibodies and demonstrated that these were present in a low titre in a further two SLE patients neither of whom had a history of blistering. Once more there was binding to both sides of the split. We conclude that although there may be low titres of antibodies to several BMZ antigens in patients with SLE, these are not always associated with blistering and their role in the initiation or perpetuation of cutaneous disease is uncertain...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Scabies is a {{contagious}} infestation affecting {{subjects of}} all ages, races, and social conditions. OBJECTIVE: We report {{a case of}} a 79 -year-old man who developed a <b>bullous</b> pemphigoid-like <b>eruption.</b> He presented to our unit 4 months after the onset of symptoms. An autoimmune bullous disease was suspected. Direct immunofluorescence on a skin specimen and anti-desmoglein 1, anti-desmoglein 3, and anti-bullous pemphigoid antigen 180 were negative. Surprisingly, the histology of a skin lesion demonstrated the presence of scabies, which was successfully treated with benzyl benzoate 20 %.

40|$|A 76 -year-old {{man with}} {{interstitial}} lung disease was admitted to our institution after developing persistent dyspnea upon effort. He also had a relapse of <b>bullous</b> <b>eruptions</b> on {{the skin of the}} trunk and extremities, previously diagnosed as vesicular pemphigoid. Direct immunofluorescence of a skin biopsy specimen using fluorescence microscopy showed the linear deposition of immunglobulin A (IgA), IgG and C 3 along the basement membrane. These findings indicated a definitive diagnosis of linear IgA/IgG bullous dermatosis. Chest computed tomography, bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial lung biopsy findings suggested nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Direct immunofluorescence of the lung biopsy specimens using fluorescence microscopy also showed a deposition of IgA, IgG and C 3 along the epithelial cell membranes and basement membranes of the bronchioles and alveoli. Lung disorders associated with linear IgA/IgG bullous dermatosis are extremely rare and, to our knowledge, this is the first report of such a case of interstitial pneumonia. 著者版でのFigure 1 は非公開。出版社版はDOIリンクを参照のこと...|$|R
40|$|A 50 year old, healthy man {{developed}} a severe bullous allergic reaction after producing coatings.

40|$|Adverse drug {{reactions}} {{are a common}} medical problem.

Clinical manifestations of the skin comprise manifold appearances from mild macular exanthems to <b>bullous</b> <b>eruptions,</b> and urticaria, angioedema to anaphylaxis. Systemic hypersensitivity reactions can affect nearly all internal organs and cells. Characteristic clinical danger signs for severe allergic drug reactions, for immediate type {{as well as for}} delayed type manifestations, help to recognise the incipient allergic drug reaction, to stop the further administration of the potential elicitor/allergen and to start therapeutic actions. It is essential for the success of a further allergologic work-up of such reactions to describe and document accurately the morphologic characteristics of the skin and other organ manifestations and the exact time course of medication intake and development of the clinical adverse reaction.

40|$|The {{onset of}} mastocytosis occurs between birth and 2 {{years of age}} in {{approximately}} 55 % of all cases; an additional 10 % develop the disease {{before the age of}} 15 years. Mastocytosis in these age groups differs in many respects from mastocytosis that has its onset in adulthood. The typical presentation of pediatric-onset mastocytosis consists of cutaneous manifestations: either a solitary mastocytoma, urticaria pigmentosa, or, less commonly, diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis. Particularly in infants, <b>bullous</b> <b>eruptions</b> may occur. Mastocytosis in infants and children may involve internal organs, including the bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract, although such manifestations appear to be less common in children than in adults. Plasma histamine levels may be elevated in pediatric- onset mastocytosis. Treatment usually involves the use of H 1 and H 2 antihistamines to control itching and to control the hypersecretion of gastric acid that may occur. The prognosis for children with mast cell disease is variable; approximately half of the children with urticaria pigmentosa may experience resolution of lesions and symptoms by adolescence...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an {{acquired}} autoimmune disease, with typical histology and immune pathological findings, {{which might be}} associated with drug therapy. The list of responsible drugs increases every year, but a current literature revision {{do not include the}} mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. By converse, bullous pemghigoid cases have been described in renal transplant recipients and associated with the allogenic graft itself, causing a cross reaction against the skin, or unbalancing the immune response, through a chronic cell-mediated suppression, non-specifically favouring the autoantibody production. OBJECT AND RESULTS: Two cases of BP occurred, respectively, 10 days to 2 months after the addition to their current regimen of everolimus in a 35 -year-old woman and sirolimus in a 65 -year-old man. The graft functionality was within normal range. General corticosteroids therapy resistance, immediate improvement after drug discontinuation (dechallenge) and relapse after re-exposure (rechallenge) were striking criteria supporting a causative role of the drugs, grouped in the mTOR inhibitors class. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of drug-induced events is crucial for early management, and particularly <b>bullous</b> <b>eruptions</b> affect patients' health and quality of life. Additional research is necessary to confirm the m-TOR inhibitors association, which exploit the possible mechanisms and eventually point out preventive measures...|$|R
