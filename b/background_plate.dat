5|$|For {{stationary}} shots where Superman is seen flying toward or {{away from}} the camera, blue screen matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a matted area of a <b>background</b> <b>plate</b> shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would {{give the appearance of}} flying away or toward the contents of the <b>background</b> <b>plate.</b> The disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the <b>background</b> <b>plate,</b> the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Terrell kills Jedda, a Regula scientist, by {{vaporizing}} him with a phaser was filmed in two takes. Winfield and the related actors first played out the scene; this footage became the <b>background</b> <b>plate.</b> A blue screen was wheeled onto the set and actor John Vargas, {{the recipient of the}} phaser blast, acted out his response to being hit with the energy weapon. A phaser beam element was placed on top of the <b>background</b> <b>plate,</b> and Vargas' shots were optically dissolved into an airbrushed disintegration effect which matched Vargas' position in every frame.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the shot}} is {{tracking}} with Superman as he flies (such {{as in the}} Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended {{in front of a}} background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back at many times the original intensity directly into a combined camera/projector. The result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the <b>background</b> <b>plate,</b> with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} that an additional nitrous oxide (N 2 O) plasma treatment step after the regular SiNx:H anti-reflective coating (ARC) deposition practically eliminates <b>background</b> <b>plating</b> during Ni-Cu contact metallization for c-Si solar cells. This step is relatively simple and could henceforth enable {{the commercialization of}} plated Ni-Cu contacts, which is currently inhibited by the creation of localized metal-silicon interfaces due to <b>background</b> <b>plating,</b> among other issues like adhesion. The average active area efficiency and fill-factor of reference cells without any plasma treatment are 17. 4 % and 73. 5 %, respectively. N 2 O plasma treatment before ARC deposition leads to an improved average fill-factor of 75. 0 %. This improvement is attributed {{to a reduction in}} the area affected by <b>background</b> <b>plating</b> by approximately 40 % due to the formation of a thin silicon oxy-nitride layer. N 2 O plasma treatment after ARC deposition is even more effective and can overcome <b>background</b> <b>plating</b> with an average active area cell efficiency and fill-factor of 18. 5 % and 77. 5 %, respectively. This performance improvement is attributed to oxidation of the ARC surface by the plasma post-treatment. Analysis of <b>background</b> <b>plating</b> losses is complemented by current-voltage curve fits to a 3 -diode model with resistance limited recombination, performed by the freely available program " 2 / 3 -Diode Fit".

5|$|The {{battle in}} the nebula was a {{difficult}} sequence to accomplish {{without the aid of}} computer-generated models. The swirling nebula was created by injecting a latex rubber and ammonia mixture into a cloud tank filled with fresh and salt water. All the footage was shot at two frames per second to give the illusion of faster movement. The vibrant abstract colors of the nebula were simulated by lighting the tank using colored gels. Additional light effects such as auroras were created by the ILM animation department. Using matte work, the ships were physically stuck on a <b>background</b> <b>plate</b> to complete the shot. The destruction of the Reliants engine nacelle was created by superimposing shots of the engine blowing apart and explosions over the model.|$|E
25|$|To make syncing the puppet's actions {{with the}} live-action shots easier, the effects team {{developed}} an instant compositing system using LaserDisc.

500|$|Shrek was {{originally}} {{set up to}} be a live-action/CG animation hybrid with <b>background</b> <b>plate</b> miniature sets and the main characters composited into the scene as motion-captured computer graphics, using an ExpertVision Hires Falcon 10 camera system to capture and apply realistic human movement to the characters. A sizable crew was hired to run a test, and after {{a year and a half}} of R & D, the test was finally screened in May 1997. The results were not satisfactory, with Katzenberg stating [...] "It looked terrible, it didn't work, it wasn't funny, and we didn't like it." [...] The studio then turned to its production partners at Pacific Data Images (PDI), who began production with the studio in 1998 and helped Shrek get to its final, computer-animated look. At this time, Antz was still in production by the studio and Effects Supervisor Ken Bielenberg was asked by Aron Warner [...] "to start development for Shrek." [...] Similar to previous PDI films, PDI used its own proprietary software (like its own Fluid Animation System) for its animated movies. For some elements, however, it also took advantage of some of the powerhouse animation software in the market. This is particularly true with Maya, which PDI used for most of its dynamic cloth animation and for the hair of Fiona and Farquaad.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis work {{describes}} {{a method to}} measure the metallized area on the front side of silicon wafer solar cells. The method is especially applicable to detect and quantify <b>background</b> <b>plating,</b> which can occur {{in the production of}} solar cells with plated front-side metallization. The metallized area of plated solar cells is determined by an image processing algorithm (“MetDetect”) using images of the solar cell front side obtained by a simple commercially available flatbed scanner. The algorithm is verified by the comparison of scanned images from test samples with microscope images. Furthermore a correlation of the metallized area with the measured short-circuit current density of the samples justifies the proposed method. With “MetDetect” a precise quantification of the <b>background</b> <b>plating</b> on the plated solar cell front side can be realized. It is suitable for inline inspection in solar cell production or quantification of pinholes and cracks in the surface dielectric. In this work “MetDetect” is applied to corroborate the observation that <b>background</b> <b>plating</b> of solar cells with a nickel copper front side metallization can surprisingly be removed during plating by a thin Sn-capping...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} years {{efforts were made to}} {{overcome}} the widespread screen printing metallization technique to reduce shading of the front side, increase the finger conductivity, and improve the contact properties of the metallization of crystalline silicon solar cells. A promising approach is plating via wet chemical metal deposition. Hereby, the metals nickel as contact layer and copper or silver as conduction layer are alternatives to the thick film screen printing process. One challenge using this technique is to avoid the unwanted <b>background</b> <b>plating</b> where the metal is not only deposited on the opened emitter structures but also partly on the isolating surface of the silicon nitride layer. In this paper a detailed overview of the origin of <b>background</b> <b>plating</b> is given, documented by scanning electron microscope pictures. By cutting a groove in the surface of the sample and milling the unwanted metallization as well as the silicon underneath in 12. 5 nm steps with a focused gallium ion beam, it was possible to investigate the cross sections by EDX and reveal different origins for the <b>background</b> <b>plating</b> behavior...|$|R
500|$|Traveling through time, Kirk {{and crew}} {{experience}} what author Jody Duncan Shay termed a [...] "dreamlike state". The script's only {{direction for the}} effect was [...] "now [...] go through time"; Nimoy and McQuarrie envisioned Kirk's dream as a montage of bizarre images. The filmmakers decided early on {{that part of the}} dream sequence would use computer-generated animation to give it an unreal quality divorced {{from the rest of the}} film. ILM worked from McQuarrie's storyboards and created a rough mock-up or animatic to show Nimoy and hone the direction of the sequence. For the very beginning of the dream, the inside of the Bird-of-Prey bridge was painted stark white. Part of the final sequence involved morphing the heads of the Enterprise crew into one another; ILM digitized the cast members' heads using a 3-D scanning technology developed by Cyberware and used the resulting data for the computer models. Because each head model had the same number of key points of reference, transforming one character into another was simple; more difficult, the animators recalled, was ensuring that the transformation looked [...] "pleasing" [...] and not [...] "grotesque". The resulting thirty seconds of footage took weeks to render; the department used every spare computer they could find to help in the processing chores. ILM's stage, optical, and matte departments collaborated to complete other shots for the dream sequence. The shot of a man's fall to Earth was created by filming a small puppet on bluescreen. Shots of liquid nitrogen composited behind the puppet gave the impression of smoke. The <b>background</b> <b>plate</b> of the planet was a large matte that allowed the camera to zoom in very close. The final shot of marshy terrain was practical and required no effects.|$|E
2500|$|David Fincher {{wanted the}} alien to be, [...] "more of a puma, or a beast" [...] {{as opposed to}} the upright, {{humanoid}} posture of the previous films, so the designer of the original alien, H. R. Giger, was contacted to generate new sketch ideas. His revisions included longer, thinner legs, the removal of [...] "pipes" [...] around the spine, and an idea for a sharp alien [...] "tongue" [...] in place of the secondary jaws. Working from his studio in Zurich, Giger produced these new sketches which he faxed to Cornelius de Fries who then created their model counterparts out of plasticine. The only one of Giger's designs that wound up in the final project was a [...] "Bambi Burster" [...] Alien that had long legs and walked on all fours. ADI also built a full-scale Bunraku-style puppet of this design which was operated on-set as an in-camera effect. Scenes using this approach were cut from the final release due to the limitations of chemical compositing techniques, making it exceedingly difficult to remove the puppeteers from the <b>background</b> <b>plate,</b> but {{can be seen in the}} [...] "Assembly Cut" [...] of the film.|$|E
2500|$|Watts, Holland, Batalon, Harrier, Revolori, and Zendaya {{appeared}} at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con to show an exclusive clip of the film, which also had a panel at Comic Con Experience 2016. The first trailer for Homecoming premiered on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on December 8, 2016, and was released online alongside an international version which featured some different shots and dialogue. Feige thought there was enough of {{a difference between the}} two that [...] "it would be fun for people to see both." [...] The shots of Vulture descending through a hotel atrium and Spider-Man swinging with Iron Man flying beside him were created specifically for the trailer, not the film. Watts explained that the Vulture shot was created for Comic-Con before much of the film had been shot, and [...] "was never meant to be in the movie", but he was able to repurpose the angle for Vulture's reveal in the film. The Spider-Man and Iron Man shot was created because the marketing team wanted a shot of the two together and existing shots for the film [...] "just didn’t look that great" [...] then. The shot used in the trailer was made with a <b>background</b> <b>plate</b> taken when filming the subway in Queens. The two trailers were viewed over 266 million times globally within a week.|$|E

It could be less time consuming — and therefore less expensive — than the process of optically separating and combining the background and foreground images using an optical printer. It also allowed the director and/or director of photography to view the combined sequence live, allowing for such effects to be filmed more like a regular sequence, and the performers could be specifically directed to time their actions to action or movement on the projected images.|$|E
