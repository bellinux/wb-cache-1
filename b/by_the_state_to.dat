5|$|Although Connecticut {{is divided}} into counties, there is no county {{government}} in Connecticut and local government consists of cities and towns. County government was abolished in Connecticut in 1960, although the names remain for geographical purposes. Counties are, however, still used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> organize its judicial and state marshal system. Connecticut's court jurisdictions still adhere to the county boundaries, except for Fairfield, Hartford and New Haven, which have been further subdivided into several jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|The first suit, Montauk Tribe of Indians v. Long Island R.R. Co., {{brought by}} Wyandank Pharaoh {{in the name}} of the tribe, was {{dismissed}} because the tribe had not been explicitly authorized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> sue in its own name.|$|E
5|$|A request <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> {{dismiss the}} suit was denied in August 1966, and the case was {{eventually}} heard by the state Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. In the meantime, the state built the easternmost mile (1.6km) of the new alignment, which was not affected by the lawsuit. On July7, 1967, the court ruled 6–1 {{in favor of the}} Sleepy Hollow Valley Committee. As a result, the western half of the new road was moved an additional mile to the north, bypassing North Tarrytown completely. The new alignment of NY117 was completed in November1970 and its former alignment along Bedford Road was redesignated as NY448.|$|E

50|$|During the 17th {{century the}} wool and {{knitting}} industry dominated the rural economy. So much attention {{was paid to}} the production of woollen garments that legislation was introduced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> control <b>the</b> time devoted to knitting as the gathering of vraic (seaweed used for fertiliser) and harvesting were being neglected.|$|R
25|$|The war {{finally ended}} in 1783 and was {{followed}} by a period of prosperity. The national government was still operating under the Articles of Confederation and was able to settle the issue of the western territories, which were ceded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> Congress. American settlers moved rapidly into those areas, with Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee becoming <b>states</b> in <b>the</b> 1790s.|$|R
5|$|A {{segment of}} what is now SR11 was {{originally}} added to the state highway system in 1895 as a Blanchard Whatcom County line road. The highway became State Road6 in 1905 and was named Waterfront Road in 1907. The road was incorporated into the Pacific Highway in 1913 and U.S. Route99 (US99) in 1926. After an inland bypass was designated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> become US99 in 1931, Chuckanut Drive became U.S. Route99 Alternate. During the 1964 highway renumbering, the road became SR11. In 1987, SR11 was realigned through Bellingham, shifting its northern terminus south to Fairhaven.|$|E
5|$|Feletti faced a court trial {{under the}} code of laws in effect in Bologna {{at the time of}} Edgardo's removal. Carboni {{proposed}} that even under the pontifical laws, the seizure was illegal—he reported that he had seen no evidence to support the friar's claim that he had acted following instructions from Rome, and that there was substantial evidence casting doubt on Morisi's account, but so far as he could see Feletti had done nothing to verify what she had said before ordering the child removed. After Feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted, saying he was putting his defence in the hands of God and the Virgin Mary, the experienced Bologna lawyer Francesco Jussi was appointed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> defend him.|$|E

Charity bingo games or raffles are also allowed. Card games, darts, billiards and other games are permitted as long as no money is exchanged, and no prizes are given.|$|E
50|$|Gavan Duffy & Rich JJ {{in their}} dissent placed {{emphasis}} on the powers of <b>the</b> <b>States,</b> holding that <b>The</b> enumerated powers entrusted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth are <b>stated</b> in language adopted after prolonged and meticulous discussion.

25|$|In the 1780s the {{national}} government was able to settle {{the issue of the}} western territories, which were ceded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> Congress and became territories. With the migration of settlers to the Northwest, soon they became states. Nationalists worried that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even internal revolts such as the Shays' Rebellion of 1786 in Massachusetts.|$|R

5|$|In 1977, {{when the}} Jeffries Freeway (I-96) was completed, M-14 was {{shortened}} {{to have its}} eastern terminus at I-275 exit28 in Plymouth Township, and the portion of Plymouth Road within the city of Detroit was returned to local control. The portion of Plymouth Road–Ann Arbor Road between I-275 and the city boundary with Redford Township was retained as an unsigned trunkline, maintained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> this day. In 1979, the final segment of the M-14 freeway, between M-153 and I-275 was completed. The former route of M-14 in Washtenaw County along Plymouth–Ann Arbor Road was returned to local control. The portion of Ann Arbor Road from the Wayne County line east to I-275 also became an unsigned state trunkline, also still maintained by MDOT.|$|E
5|$|Rice cultivation: In 2002, a Chinese and Japanese group {{reported}} the discovery in eastern China of fossilised phytoliths of domesticated rice apparently {{dating back to}} 11,900 BC or earlier. However, phytolith data are controversial in some quarters due to potential contamination problems. It is likely that demonstrated rice was cultivated in the middle Yangtze Valley by 7000 BC, as shown in finds from the Pengtoushan culture at Bashidang, Changde, Hunan. By 5000 BC, rice had been domesticated at Hemudu culture near the Yangtze Delta and was being cooked in pots. Although millet remained the main crop in northern China throughout history, several sporadic attempts were made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> introduce rice around the Bohai Gulf {{as early as the}} 1st century.|$|E
5|$|The {{governors}} remained {{without an}} official residence until 1919 {{when the state}} purchased a home located at 101 East 27th St., Indianapolis, for $65,000 and furnished it for an additional $20,000. It was built by Henry Kahn in 1908 and had the design of an English country house. The home had a Gothic interior with high, beamed ceilings and luxurious Wilton carpeting. After a brief renovation, the home was inhabited by the governor starting in 1919 and remained so until 1945. The building was sold <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> the Marott Hotel, which intended {{to turn it into}} a clubhouse, but eventually demolished it in 1962 to clear land for a parking lot.|$|E

5|$|Christmas, called Bôŗodin (Great day) {{is perhaps}} the next major festival celebrated in Kolkata, after Durga Puja.

The state tourism department organises the gala Christmas Festival every year in Park Street. The whole of Park Street is decked out in colourful lights, and food stalls sell cakes, chocolates, Chinese cuisines, momo, and various other items. Musical groups from Darjeeling and other states of North East India are invited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> perform choir recitals, carols, and jazz numbers. Buddha Purnima, which marks the birth of Gautama Buddha, {{is one of the}} most important Hindu/Buddhist festivals and is celebrated with much gusto in the Darjeeling hills. On this day, processions begin at each of the various Buddhist monasteries, or gumpas, and congregate at the Mall, Chowrasta. The Lamas chant mantras and sound their bugles, and students as well as people from all communities carry the holy books or pustaks on their heads. Besides Buddha Purnima, Dashain, or Dusshera, Holi, Diwali, Losar, Namsoong or the Lepcha New Year, and Losoong are the other major festivals of the Darjeeling Himalayan region.|$|E
