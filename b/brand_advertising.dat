Nielsen, a market analyst whose career had begun in the 1920s with <b>brand</b> <b>advertising</b> {{analysis}} and had expanded into radio market analysis during the 1930s, culminating in Nielsen ratings of radio programming, which was meant to provide statistics as to the markets of radio shows.

25|$|On 21 September 1995 the Supreme Court of Canada {{upheld the}} Tobacco Products Control Act as legal, forcing the tobacco {{companies}} operating in Canada to print hazard warnings on all cigarette packs. However, the Court struck down the requirement that the health warnings be unattributed, as this requirement violated the right to free speech, further ruling {{that it was in}} the federal government's jurisdiction to pass such laws, as it fell under the peace, order and good government clause. Recently, sin taxes have been added to tobacco products, with the objective of decreasing usage by making the products less affordable. Currently, radio ads, television commercials, event sponsoring, promotional giveaways and other types of <b>brand</b> <b>advertising</b> are prohibited as well as in-store product displays. However, certain forms of advertising are permitted, such as print advertisements in magazines with an adult readership of 85% minimum.|$|E

Google stated that it had [...] "begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear". In early-April 2017, the YouTube channel h3h3Productions presented evidence claiming that a Wall Street Journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major <b>brand</b> <b>advertising</b> on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video, citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader.

2500|$|Many blogs provide {{commentary}} {{on a particular}} subject or topic, ranging from politics to sports.

A typical blog combines text, digital images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic.
