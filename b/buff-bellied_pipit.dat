5|$|The family Motacillidae {{consists}} of the wagtails, pipits and longclaws. The largest {{of the three groups}} is the pipits in the genus Anthus, which are typically brown-plumaged terrestrial insectivores. Their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems; the water pipit and the <b>buff-bellied</b> <b>pipit</b> were both formerly considered subspecies of the Eurasian rock pipit. Of these, the rock pipit is the more closely related to the water pipit, based on external and molecular characteristics. Other near relatives are the meadow, red-throated and rosy pipits.|$|E

5000|$|Both {{subspecies}} of the <b>buff-bellied</b> <b>pipit</b> are migratory. The <b>buff-bellied</b> <b>pipit</b> winters on the Pacific {{coast of}} North America, {{and on the}} Atlantic coast from the southern North America to Central America. At least regarding the <b>buff-bellied</b> <b>pipit,</b> its wintering range seems to have expanded northwards in the 20th century and the birds seem to spend less time in winter quarters: in northern Ohio, for example, the species was recorded as [...] "not common" [...] during migration in May and September/October in the 1900s (decade), but today it is considered a [...] "widespread migrant" [...] in that region, found between March and May and from late September to November, with many birds actually wintering this far north. Asian birds winter mainly from Pakistan east to and Southeast Asia, with occasional birds found {{as far north as}} Yunnan and some in Japan apparently being all-year residents or migrating but a little. The American and Asian subspecies are rare vagrants to Western and Eastern Europe, respectively.|$|E

50|$|The {{first thing}} <b>buff-bellied</b> <b>pipits</b> {{do when they}} arrive on the {{breeding}} site, during snowmelt, is pairing. Indeed, males will start to fight one on one {{to win over the}} female and pair with it during the entire breeding season. They also fight for the snow-free sites that would be better for nesting. The moment is also very important because the melting snow implies an increase in arthropods abundance, which constitute the main food source for these birds. After the fight and the pairing, nesting is the next step. Nests are most often found on the ground in dry or wet meadows, always with a helpful protection, but they are never placed in shrubs or trees. The composition of the ideal nest depends on whatever is around the nesting area, but it is usually made of sedge, remains or new fine grass, and sometimes some horse hairs. The final issue <b>buff-bellied</b> <b>pipits</b> have to deal with is nest success. The nest is indeed the target for numerous predators such as ants or hawks. If this step is successful, an egg can be produced. The female will not lay an egg if the conditions, such as temperature and nesting site, are not optimal. If the first attempt fails, her time to lay an egg is reduced. In general, <b>buff-bellied</b> <b>pipits</b> continuously lay eggs over a period of 4 to 5 days after snow-melt (in April-May) until mid-July. After this period, the male testes decrease in size and the female refuses any copulation. The clutch size is usually 5 eggs but it can vary according to snowfalls, the parents’ reproductive ability and predation. Eggs are incubated for 13-14 days. During this time, the female does not leave the nest, but is still very reactive to any movement around her. She communicates by singing to the male that brings her food and defends their territory. Four or five days after hatching, the young is skinny, blue-gray in color, and only has its secondary feathers. For a week, the female will brood the clutch, but both parents will feed them. After these 7 days, the birds are ready for fledging but they will still be fed by their parents for 14 days after their departure. Finally, immature birds will form little flocks with other immature birds and wander off.|$|R
50|$|Like its relatives, {{this species}} is insectivorous. The {{breeding}} habitat of <b>buff-bellied</b> <b>pipit</b> is tundra, but outside the breeding season {{it is found}} in open lightly vegetated areas, similar to those favoured by the water pipit (A. spinoletta).|$|E
50|$|The <b>buff-bellied</b> <b>pipit</b> (Anthus rubescens), or American pipit as it {{is known}} in North America, is a small {{songbird}} found {{on both sides of the}} northern Pacific. It was first described by Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 Ornithologia Britannica. It was formerly classified as a form of the water pipit.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} closely related to Eurasian rock pipit (A. petrosus) and water pipit (A. spinoletta), all three forms having {{previously}} been considered conspecific. They can be differentiated by their vocalizations and some visual cues, but rock and <b>buff-bellied</b> <b>pipit</b> are not found sympatrically except as vagrant individuals, and the ranges of buff-bellied and water pipits overlap only in a small area in Central Asia.|$|E

50|$|Like {{most other}} pipits, the <b>buff-bellied</b> <b>pipit</b> is an undistinguished-looking species which usually {{can be seen}} to run around on the ground. The rubescens {{subspecies}} (or American pipit) has lightly streaked grey-brown upperparts and is diffusely streaked below on the buff breast and flanks. The belly is whitish, the bill and legs are dark. The japonicus subspecies (or Japanese pipit) is darker above and has bolder black streaking on its whiter underparts; its legs have a reddish hue. The call is a squeaky sip.|$|E

50|$|Non-endemic landbirds and {{shorebirds}} occur {{mostly as}} vagrants {{or use the}} island as a stopover during migration; the northern mockingbird became established in the late 20th century. Among those that are recorded not infrequently are great blue heron, Hudsonian curlew, spotted sandpiper and wandering tattler. Unlike the situation on smaller and more isolated Clarión, wind-blown or vagrant birds seem to constititute {{the bulk of the}} recorded species, including brown pelican, osprey, peregrine falcon, semipalmated plover, willet, sanderling, belted kingfisher and <b>buff-bellied</b> <b>pipit.</b> It may be that this puzzling observation is due to the presence of the red-tailed hawks and cats, which has at least made the local Urosaurus more wary than its relative on Clarión, and might deter passing birds from stopping on Socorro.|$|E
50|$|The pipits {{are active}} {{terrestrial}} birds that usually {{spend most of}} their time on the ground. They will fly in order to display during breeding, while migrating and dispersing, and also when flushed by danger. A few species make use of trees, perching in them and flying to them when disturbed. Low shrubs, rocks and termite nests may also be used as vantage points. Like their relatives the wagtails, pipits engage in tail-wagging. The way in which a pipit does this can provide clues to its identity in otherwise similar looking species. Upland pipits, for example, flick their tails quite quickly, as opposed to olive-backed pipits which wag their tails more gently. In general pipits move their tails quite slowly. The <b>buff-bellied</b> <b>pipit</b> wags its tail both up and down and from side to side. The exact function of tail-wagging is unclear; in the related wagtails it is thought to be a signal to predators of vigilance.|$|E
