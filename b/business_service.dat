Krohn Air had just bought a Jetstream 32 from Sun-Air, which it planned to use on a new route from Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget to Trondheim. However, after Widerøe stated that it would start that route in 2011, Krohn Air changed their plans and announced that the aircraft would instead be used on the route from Molde to Bergen. The Bergen service was started on 31 August. On 7 September, the airline announced it would start services from Molde to Stavanger Airport, Sola on 13 August. Because there were few passengers, the services to Bergen and Stavanger were terminated from 19 November 2010.|$|E

We {{show that there}} is an equivalence relation between a locally weighted Logit and Poisson model. We apply our model to estimate firm-specific preferences of <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms for location attributes such as diversity of economic activities and specialisation of <b>business</b> <b>services.</b> We correct for endogeneity of our specialisation measure by means of a control function approach, using instruments external as well as internal to the model. We find that <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms have a relatively strong preference for specialised clusters of <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms, conditional on density of economic activity. A standard deviation increase in <b>business</b> <b>services</b> specialisation of a location leads to a 40 percent increase in the probability that a <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firm locates there, supporting theories of Marshall, Arrow and Romer. <b>Business</b> <b>services</b> firms also have a preference to locate near a group of firms that belong to the same sector, not necessarily <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms, so diversity is negatively related to location decisions.

25|$|Unlike {{the music}} {{services}} Muzak / DMX Music or Music Choice, the SiriusXM for <b>Business</b> <b>service</b> {{uses the same}} channels and SDARS delivery platform as the consumer Sirius service.

The highly elliptical orbit of the Sirius satellite constellation can pose difficulties for the reliable delivery of the signal to stationary antennas in certain parts of the country. To eliminate this potential problem, Sirius launched a new geostationary satellite, FM-5, to improve service to non-mobile customers such as those of SiriusXM for Business. The service can also be accessed online using Sirius' online streaming technology, allowing any business with a broadband Internet connection to overcome any potential reception issues. Additionally, Sirius is applying for repeaters in Hawaii and Alaska and has already been granted authority for 20 repeaters covering the island of Puerto Rico by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} North station was demolished, its site was {{reclaimed}} {{along with the}} site of the neighbouring Anglo Great Lakes Graphite Plant. The plant had made high-purity graphite for use in magnox nuclear reactors, and operated using the North station's available excess generating capacity, as large quantities of cheap electricity were essential for production. It was demolished around {{the same time as the}} stations, and left the site littered with graphite blocks. At , the reclamation of the two neighbouring sites was one of the UK's largest land reclamation schemes; it was completed in 2000. This made way for an industrial/business park, Newburn Riverside, the first phase of whose construction was completed in 2005. As of 2009 it was still expanding, and expected to provide 5,000 jobs and £116million of private sector investment once completed. The park has a [...] cycle route and nature trail around its edge, which takes visitors, walkers and cyclists beside the river and past the point in which the North station's cooling towers once stood. One of the buildings in the business park was named Stella House, as a tribute to the power station. It is occupied by One NorthEast, the regional development agency for the North East of England. In early 2012, Stella House became the National HQ of the NHS <b>Business</b> <b>Service</b> Authority following the winding down of One NorthEast.

40|$|The <b>business</b> <b>services</b> sector {{plays an}} {{increasingly}} important role in enhancing a country’s competitiveness.

In traditional and high-labor intensive sectors, it is the creation of a brand, design and marketing to play a central role, whereas in technology-intensive sectors, this role is played by R&D and after sale assistance. Recently, in line with developments at world level, the Italian economy has witnessed a significant increase of <b>business</b> <b>services.</b> In the EU’s total supply of <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> however, Italy still occupies a relatively weak position, and the average size of Italian <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms is below the European one. Such features, given the relevance of services in firms’ competitiveness and in internationalization trends may represent a factor of weakness for the Italian economy. This book recommends to invest resources in <b>business</b> <b>services</b> to “support” production activities: it highlights which services may “contribute” the most to the internationalization process; therefore helping to formulate adequate economic policies. The book also shows that the supply of <b>business</b> <b>services</b> is highly diversified across regions and categories, in terms of both endowment and access. Only by reducing these differences, the country’s competitiveness can be improved.
