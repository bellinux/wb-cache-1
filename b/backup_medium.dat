5000|$|Insteon is an {{integrated}} dual-mesh (formerly {{referred to as}} [...] "dual-band") network that combines wireless radio frequency (RF) and a building's existing electrical wiring. The electrical wiring becomes a <b>backup</b> transmission <b>medium</b> {{in the event of}} RF/wireless interference. Conversely, RF/wireless becomes a <b>backup</b> transmission <b>medium</b> in the event of powerline interference. As a peer-to-peer network, devices do not require network supervision, thus allowing optional operation without central controllers and routing tables.|$|R
40|$|Fast bus {{transfer}} {{method is}} the most popular and residual voltage transfer method that is used as a <b>backup</b> in <b>medium</b> voltage buses in general. The use of the advanced technology like open circuit voltage prediction and digital signal processing algorithms can improve the reliability of fast transfer scheme. However, according to the survey results of the recent operation records in nuclear power plants, there were many instances where the fast transfer scheme has failed. To assure bus transfer in any conditions and circumstances, uninterruptible bus transfer scheme utilizing {{the state of the art}} medium voltage UPS is discussed and elaborated...|$|R
5000|$|Partial file copying: Instead of copying whole files, one {{can limit}} the backup to only the blocks or bytes within a file that {{have changed in}} a given period of time. This {{technique}} can use substantially less storage space on the <b>backup</b> <b>medium,</b> but requires {{a high level of}} sophistication to reconstruct files in a restore situation. Some implementations require integration with the source file system.|$|E

Through the wholly owned subsidiary O3b Networks, SES also operates 9 active and 3 <b>backup</b> <b>medium</b> Earth orbit satellites providing satellite Internet services and mobile backhaul services to remote and isolated areas.|$|E
5000|$|Validation: Many backup {{programs}} use checksums or hashes {{to validate}} {{that the data}} was accurately copied. These offer several advantages. First, they allow data integrity to be verified {{without reference to the}} original file: if the file as stored on the <b>backup</b> <b>medium</b> has the same checksum as the saved value, then it is very probably correct. Second, some backup programs can use checksums to avoid making redundant copies of files, and thus improve backup speed. This is particularly useful for the de-duplication process.|$|E
50|$|The Wavre radio {{transmitter}} is a facility for mediumwave, shortwave, FM and TV broadcasting near Wavre in Belgium. For the mediumwave transmissions {{it uses a}} grounded 250-metre-high guyed mast. Furthermore, there is a <b>backup</b> mast for <b>medium</b> wave transmissions, which is 90 metres high. For shortwave broadcasting several directional antennas and a curtain antenna are used. The towers {{are two of the}} tallest structures in Belgium.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} share a single backup device among {{multiple}} clients has been confined {{in the past to}} SANattached tape libraries. Now, with ATA disk serving as a <b>backup</b> <b>medium,</b> the NS 700 allows backup device sharing in a distributed environment where SAN connectivity is nonexistent. The NS 700 could augment traditional backup strategies by performing an initial backup to ATA disk storage while cloning it to tape later. This document covers different backup strategies and presents various configurations involving the NS 700 /ATA and LEGATO NetWorker 7. 1...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in smartphones and mobile devices {{have brought a}} tremendous growth in the mobile data communication. The mobile traffic volume is predicted to consume 10. 8 Exabytes per month by 2016, 18 x increase from that of 2011 [1]. While the next-generation mobile technologies such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) are being aggressively deployed, {{they are unlikely to}} catch up with the explosive demands. One promising solution is to op-portunistically offload the bandwidth-limited mobile data transfer to the wired Internet via Wi-Fi while using the mobile networks as a <b>backup</b> <b>medium</b> to meet the transfer deadline with delay-tolerant networking (DTN) [2]. However, deploying DTN faces numerous barriers since existing applications do not seamlessly handle net-work delays and disruptions caused by human mobility. In this paper, we propose a practical DTN architecture in city mobile network environments. Existing DTN designs assume tha...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 72) System backup is {{the periodic}} copying of a computer's data to a <b>backup</b> <b>medium</b> {{in order to}} prevent loss of information due to hardware failure or accidental deletion of files. Most backup systems are inefficient and inflexible, requiring reprogramming with each change in system configuration. The goal of this project was to create a flexible and also efficient backup system, that would not become obsolete or require reprogramming for each system configuration change. In addition, the backup program was to minimize the chances of errors being introduced by operator actions. A PASCAL program was designed and implemented that generates backup instructions, based on information in a data file and information provided by the computer system at runtime. An interface to the backup data was designed to minimize the introduction of erroneous data. Several backup options were provided to increase flexibility. Two additional programs (Tapelist and Update) were created to support the backup process. The backup system SYSBACKUP is currently in daily operation on three Digital Equipment Corporation VAX computers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how Amazon. com evaluated and adopted Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S 3) {{as a backup}} solution for the company’s Oracle databases. These databases are {{owned and operated by}} individual teams within the company, and are essential for Amazon. com’s day-to-day business operations. Oracle has introduced a seamless backup solution that makes it easy to use Amazon S 3 as a <b>backup</b> <b>medium</b> for Oracle databases, {{while at the same time}} removing many of the problems we’ve encountered using tape for our backups. It was natural for Amazon. com to evaluate the costs and benefits of using Amazon S 3 for Oracle Database backups, and to migrate to Amazon S 3 where it made sense. Throughout the process, we 1 engaged with Amazon Web Services (AWS) like any customer would. In turn, AWS treated us as it would treat any enterprise customer. This paper describes our migration path as an AWS reference customer to an Amazon S 3 backup solution. Our experience is detailed in the following sections...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests that it is unwise to make the a-priori assumption that university students are ready and eager to embrace modern online technologies employed to enhance the educational experience. We present an opinion on employing Wiki, a popular Web 2. 0 technology, in small student groups, based on a case-study of using it customized as a personal learning environment (PLE) for supporting thesis research in hydrology. Since inception in 2006 the system presented has proven to facilitate knowledge construction and peer-communication within and across groups of students of different academic years and to stimulate learning. Being an open ended and egalitarian system, it was a minimal burden to maintain, as all students became content authors and shared responsibility. A number of unintended uses of the system were also observed, like using it as a <b>backup</b> <b>medium</b> and mobile storage. We attribute the success and sustainability of the proposed web 2. 0 -based approach {{to the fact that the}} efforts were not limited to the application of the technology, but comprised the creation of a supporting environment with educational activities organized around it. We propose that Wiki-based PLEs are much more suitable than traditional learning management systems for supporting non-classroom education activities like thesis research in hydrology...|$|E
