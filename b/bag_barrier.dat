The tests were conducted in a three- entry section of the LLEM. Two types of explosions were used {{to evaluate the}} distributed and concentrated <b>bagged</b> <b>barrier</b> performance in a multi-entry mine section. The fuel zone of the first explosion type was only in the center B-drift. In the second explosion type, coal and stone dust mixtures were place in all three drifts. A total of six explosions, including two baseline and four barrier evaluation explosions, were conducted. Of the four barrier explosions, the distributed and concentrated barriers were each evaluated against the two explosion types. For these explosion tests, the distributed barrier extended from about 74 to 170 m and the concentrated barrier from about 74 to 104 m in B-drift. The distributed barrier successfully stopped flame propagation in both types of explosion tests. The flame extended further for the explosion tests where the dust was loaded in all three entries compared with dust loaded only in the center entry% but in both cases the flame was stopped within the barrier zone. The concentrated barrier was also successful in stopping flame propagation m both explosion tests. From the full-scale experimental mine test results, it can be concluded that both <b>bagged</b> <b>barrier</b> designs were effective in stopping coal dust explosions in the multiple entries of the LLEM...|$|R

The following packaging treatments were used: (1) Gas permeable Resinite film overwrap as a control; (2) gas flush with 1 % CO, 40 % O₂, 59 % N₂ for 2 minutes followed by film overwrap; (3) loose packaging in gas impermeable <b>barrier</b> <b>bags</b> with 100 to 150 cc ambient air; (4) 15 % CO₂, 40 % O₂, 45 % N₂ gas atmosphere; (5) 60 % CO₂, 40 % O₂ gas atmosphere; and (6) 10 % CO₂, 5 % O₂, 85 % N₂ gas atmosphere. Total psychrotrophic counts obtained from the top and bottom surfaces did not differ significantly for most sampling periods. Similar growth patterns were observed on both steak surfaces, increasing (P <. 05) primarily between Day 3 and Day 9 of post-treatment storage. The steaks packaged within the gas atmospheres had lower (P<. 05) total growth than the control steaks. Comparing atmospheres, the steaks packaged in relatively low CO₂ and O₂ levels (10 % and 5 %, respectively) had lower (P<. 05) microbial growth than steaks packaged in 15 to 60 % CO₂ and 40 % O₂ when initial contamination was low. Pseudomonas dominated the microflora on the steak surfaces in all packaging treatments during early storage. Other aerobic organisms which survived gas atmosphere treatments include Coryneforms, Micrococcus, and Microbacterium, although they did not show large increases in growth. Coryneforms were also competitive on the bottom surface of the control steaks despite domination by the pseudomonad organisms.

Yet this {{is only one of}} the key issues we face in {{the assembly}} process. The one area most frequently ignored is the impact of humidity on both components and bare boards. Although many, if not most, of the manufacturing facilities are climate controlled, there are a number of instances where the floor-clock is accidently started when moisture <b>barrier</b> <b>bags</b> (MBB) are opened during incoming inspection. Even though the MBB may be resealed, the clock is not officially paused reducing the effective life of the moisture sensitive devices (MSD’s) prior to assembly.

While the IPC D- 35 subcommittee has a working draft of IPC- 1601, Printed Board Handling and Storage Guidelines (1 st working draft – April 9, 2009), there currently is no standard for monitoring and controlling the exposure of boards to moisture prior to the assembly process.

The anoxia bags contained oxygen scavengers, which guaranteed a concentration in oxygen less than 0.1 %. Once filled, the bags were thermo-sealed and placed into a light weathering chamber equipped with a metal halide lamp (2500 W Hydrargyrum Medium-arc Iodide (HMI) lamp) and a window glass filter that removed UV radiations below 325 nm.

40|$|Moisture Sensitive Devices (MSD) {{have become}} widely {{used with the}} {{increased}} sophistication of electronic products. However, MSDs present a number of challenges when used in surface mount assembly as they may suffer internal damage during the manufacturing process {{if they are not}} handled and stored according to industry standards. In surface mount assembly, solder paste is printed on to a PCB, components are mounted and the entire board is sent through a reflow oven. In the reflow process the entire PCB and component packages are heated along with the solder and component leads. The high reflow temperatures can cause a package containing moisture to swell and crack affecting the performance and reliability of the component. These problems are normally the result of poor handling and storage of MSDs. While most of the damaged components may be detected prior to shipment of the final product, many make it to the market place only to fail out in the field. Although a component with external cracking may pass pre-shipment functional tests, subsequent high temperature and moisture exposure can induce the transport of ionic contaminants through these openings to the die surface increasing the potential for failure due to corrosion. Furthermore, internal cracking/delamination can be present even if {{there is no evidence of}} external cracks. Ball grid array (BGAs) and chip scale packages (CSPs) are especially sensitive to moisture and damage to these components can be very difficult to detect. Manufacturers must pay close attention to their handling and storage of MSDs to maximize yields and ensure the quality of their finished products.

However, the gas barrier property of a bag is the most critical parameter, as it can negatively affect the quality of the final laminate. The barrier property {{is a function of the}} bag material, uniformity, thickness and temperature. Improved barrier properties are needed for large parts, high pressure consolidated components and structures where air stays entrapped on the part surface. The air resistance property of the film is defined as permeability and is investigated in this thesis. A model was developed to evaluate the gas transport through the film and an experimental cell was implemented to characterize various commercial films. Understanding and characterizing the transport phenomena through the film allows optimization of the bagging material for various manufacturing processes. Spray-on-Bag is a scalable alternative bagging method compared to standard films. The approach allows in-situ fabrication of the bag on large and complex geometry structures where optimization of the bag properties can be varied on a local level.

40|$|PURPOSE. During {{cataract}} surgery an IOL {{is placed}} within the capsular bag. Clinical {{studies show that}} IOLs with a square edge profile and complete contact between the IOL and the anterior capsule (AC) are currently {{the best way to}} prevent posterior capsule opacification (PCO). This has been challenged by recent clinical and experimental observations, which suggest that if the capsular bag is kept open with separation of contact between the AC and posterior capsule (PC) by an "open-bag device" PCO is dramatically reduced. Therefore, the current study set out to evaluate the putative merits of an open-bag IOL (Anew Zephyr) in a human capsular bag model. METHODS. An in vitro organ culture model using the bag-zonular-ciliary body complex isolated from fellow human donor eyes was prepared. A capsulorhexis and lens extraction were performed, and an Alcon Acrysof IOL or Anew Zephyr IOL implanted. Preparations were secured by pinning the ciliary body to a silicone ring and maintained in 6 mL Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) or EMEM supplemented with 2 % vol/vol human serum (HS) and 10 ng/mL TGF-beta 2 for 28 days. Cell growth and capsular modifications were monitored with phase-contrast and modified dark-field microscopy. RESULTS. In serum-free EMEM culture conditions, cells were observed growing onto the PC of preparations implanted with an Anew Zephyr IOL, but this was retarded relative to observations in match-paired capsular bags implanted with an Alcon Acrysof IOL. In the case of cultures maintained in 2 % HS-EMEM plus TGF-b 2, the movement on to the PC was again delayed with the presence of an Anew Zephyr IOL. Differences in the degree of growth on the PC and matrix modifications were apparent with the different donors, but in each case the match-paired Alcon Acrysof implanted bag exhibited significantly greater coverage and modification of the capsule. CONCLUSIONS. The Anew Zephyr open-bag IOL performs consistently better than the Alcon Acrysof IOL in the human capsular bag model.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Numerous studies have addressed the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce numbers of bacteria on beef carcass surfaces. These treatments have included hot water, organic acids, and other sanitizers, and have been highly effective in reducing pathogens and spoilage organisms. Although these treatments are beneficial, unusual spoilage patterns due to the treatments have been claimed by members of the beef industry, including suggestions that meat becomes too clean with these treatments, and that pathogens might be able to grow faster {{due to a lack of}} competition secondary to reductions in the numbers and types of microflora. This study focused on reproducing conditions in ground beef production that may lead to unusual spoilage patterns or pathogen growth. In order to detect potential differences in spoilage patterns due to carcass decontamination treatments, bacteria were isolated and identified from packages of ground beef that were obtained from the treated carcasses. Additional studies were performed using beef inoculated with pathogens which included E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella serotype Typhimurium. The treatments consisted of the application of one of three sanitizers to the carcass surface: hot water, lactic acid, or acetic acid. Ground beef was obtained from the treated carcass, packaged under a vacuum in high oxygen <b>barrier</b> <b>bags,</b> and stored at 10 ?C and 4 ?C, and then sampled for numbers of bacteria every seven days for seven weeks. Results from the present study indicate that antimicrobial treatments applied to carcasses are not likely to affect spoilage patterns in ground beef. Unusual spoilage patterns resembling those in industrial settings were only observed when packages were stored at elevated refrigeration temperatures (10 ?C). In addition, no treatment caused an excessive outgrowth of pathogens. Bacterial type distributions were similar for all treatments, indicating no selection of bacteria due to particular treatments. Based upon the data collected in this study, it is most likely that the unusual spoilage patterns reported in the industry are caused by storage in upper ranges of refrigeration temperatures, and not by changes in the microflora of the meat...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} non-starter lactic acid {{bacteria}} (NSLAB) on the texture and flavour development in cheese was investigated using Cheddar cheese matured in impermeable cheese <b>barrier</b> <b>bags.</b> Cheeses made normally in open vats (and contaminated with adventitious NSLAB) were compared with NSLAB - free cheeses. To produce NSLAB - free cheeses, two totally enclosed cheese-making vats were designed and constructed. These vats were sterilized by soaking overnight with Iodophor, then steam flushed for 1 hour. This procedure was sufficient to exclude NSLAB but did not produce complete sterility {{as evidenced by the}} growth of bacillus - type organisms in UHT - treated milk incubated in the sterilized vats. The thermal death characteristics of representatives trains of NSLAB showed that most species would not survive milk pasteurization temperatures. However, two species, Lactobacillus casei var casei and Leuconos toc lactis were sufficiently resistant that, if present as the dominant flora of a raw milk, they could survive into the curd. Therefore, for aseptically manufactured cheeses, the milk was obtained by careful milking of the cows, to avoid NSLAB contamination. In the pasteurized vat - milks, the total bacterial count was routinely less than 1 c fujmL. A panel of tasters was trained to determine the texture and flavour of the cheeses using attribute scaling techniques. Six textural and 5 flavour attributes were defined, and the intensities of these were monitored in the cheeses at various ages up to 9 months. The aseptic cheese-making procedure effectively eliminated NSLAB contamination from the cheeses. However, when cheeses in bags were matured for long periods, a surface flora of adventitious NSLAB developed, apparently by contamination during sampling. Despite all sampling precautions, the only method found to satisfactorily prevent this contamination was waxing of the cheese surfaces prior to bagging. It was also observed that in adventitiously contaminated cheeses, the count of NSLAB in the surface 1 - 2 mm was at least 10 times the count in the remainder of the cheese. The texture and flavour of Cheddar cheeses made without NSLAB and matured at 10 C for 9 months could not be distinguished from cheeses with adventitious NSLAB matured under the same conditions. In equivalent cheeses matured at lSC, the textures were again identical but the cheeses with NSLAB had greater intensities of sharpness and sulphide than the cheeses without NSLAB. Thus, starter alone appears to be the predominant contributor of those compounds which produce Cheddar cheese flavour and NSLAB, although present, do not normally contribute to flavour production. In a final part, the growth and citrate utilizing capabilities of three leuconos toc organisms were determined in a washed- curd cheeses. Again, NSLAB - free cheeses were made since there are currently no effective means of differentiating between leucono s toc and NSLAB organisms, and NSLAB organisms can also utilize citrate.

Chapter 1, “Review {{of the economic}} and ethno-botany of the genera of the family Nyctaginaceae, 2 ̆ 2 includes a summary of literature on the topics included in the title, and an original taxonomic update of plant names used correctly and incorrectly as synonyms for Mirabilis jalapa, the type name for the plant family Nyctaginaceae. M. jalapa has been substituted for medicinal jalap from Mexico. Names in the Convolvulaceae for medicinal Jalap are also updated here, as they show the origin of many names which have been incorrectly used as synonyms in the Mirabilis literature. Chapter 2, “History of Mirabilis expansa (Ruiz and Pav.) Standl.; Growth and use in the Andes,” is also a literature review, incorporating information from several documents and papers which have only recently become readily available internationally via the Internet. These documents were translated into English for this chapter. Research in Chapter 3, “Field trials of Mirabilis expansa (Ruiz and Pav.) Standl. grown in North America; Growth, yield and quality traits,” showed that M. expansa horticultural varieties 2 ̆ 7 L 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 T 2 ̆ 7 are tolerant to the intense weather conditions of southern Illinois, when grown on constructed sand plots. In Chapter 4, “Amino Acid profiles for two horticultural varieties of Mirabilis expansa (Ruiz and Pav.) Standl. : A rare indigenous Andean crop grown in southern Illinois,” M. expansa was examined for its amino acid values and those values considered in terms of differnces between the two varieties and above and below ground structures. In addition, soil amendments peat and steer manure, considered alone and together, as well as structure and variety, were examined for their effect on production of amino acids in ANOVAs and Tukey-adjusted LS-Means run in SAS 9. 3. In Chapter 5, “Nutrients, Comparison of Amino Acid Profiles, and Cytotoxicity Testing for Mirabilis expansa (Ruiz and Pav.) Standl.,” the amino acid profiles for M. expansa from the previous chapter are compared to profiles for other crops, eggs and milk. M. expansa is shown relatively to contain extremely high amounts of total protein. In addition published values for other nutrients for M. expansa taken from translated material are combined into two tables. Also, a cytotoxicity assay carried out in collaboration with researchers at Ohio State University was used to see if the southern Illinois M. expansa material was active against highly sensitive HT- 29 colon cancer cells. Negative results from that assay serves as preliminary data for a lack of toxicity due to micro-molecules in the crop. Chapter 6, “Inexpensive nitrogen chambers for conservation of herbarium specimens,” was an outgrowth of the need to find a chemically benign manner for storing herbarium specimens of Mirabilis, used in research which led to the work described in the previous chapters. The results show that valved oxygen <b>barrier</b> <b>bags,</b> designed for clothing storage, with a small number of oxygen absorbers, can retain conditions for sufficient periods to treat specimens for pests. This allows the bags to be used as inexpensive nitrogen chambers, to treat herbarium specimens in place of expensive nitrogen systems or freezers, and without the toxic chemicals historically used in herbaria for the same purpose...|$|R
