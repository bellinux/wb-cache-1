5|$|At {{the back}} of Why Johnny Can't Read, Flesch had {{included}} 72 lists of words that young children should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him {{with a list of}} 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.|$|E
5|$|Education was {{provided}} for the children, but workhouse teachers were a particular problem. Poorly paid, without any formal training, and facing large classes of unruly children {{with little or no}} interest in their lessons, few stayed in the job {{for more than a few}} months. In an effort to force workhouses to offer at least a basic level of education, legislation was passed in 1845 requiring that all pauper apprentices should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and sign their own indenture papers. A training college for workhouse teachers was set up at Kneller Hall in Twickenham during the 1840s, but it closed in the following decade.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts. The first part, Epiphany, {{consists}} of eight chapters and focuses on the roots, development, and impact of the Scottish Enlightenment on Scotland and Great Britain. The roots come from an appreciation for democracy and literacy that developed from the Scottish Reformation, when John Knox brought Calvinist Presbyterianism to Scotland. He preached that God ordained power into the people and that it was for the people to administer and enforce God's laws, not the monarchy. For common people to understand God's laws they had to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the Bible, so schools were built in every parish and literacy rates grew rapidly, creating a Scottish-oriented market for books and writers.|$|E

5|$|After {{repairs to}} the college were {{completed}} in mid-1656, the first admissions were made. The first headmaster, Richard Dutton, was appointed in 1655, and in 1665 the institution became an incorporated charity. The number of pupils grew, with admissions rising to 100 by the 1870s. Boys were admitted based on the parish they lived in, and on need, health and background of the family. Illegitimate boys were not admitted, and all boys had to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> to a certain standard that meant they were not hard to teach. In 1878, a new schoolroom designed by architect Alfred Waterhouse (who designed Manchester Town Hall) was built in a Tudor style. The number of boys admitted was reduced to 75 in 1908 to save money, though three years later admissions increased again to 99. In 1916, no boys were admitted {{due to lack of}} funding caused by World War I, and in 1918 the number was limited to 70. Successful public appeals resulted in the numbers rising to 97 in 1929. In 1926 a scheme was set up which allowed boys to apply for scholarships to join a grammar school, which meant that while they lived at Chetham's, they were educated elsewhere during the day. Further, they would stay at grammar school until at least the age of 16 and sometimes 18.|$|E

Protestantism also initiated translations of the Bible into national languages and hereby supported the development of national literatures.|$|E
