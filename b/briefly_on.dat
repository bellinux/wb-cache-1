5|$|A gull colony {{has been}} present since 1984, {{although}} gulls were seen <b>briefly</b> <b>on</b> {{the shores of}} the new island only weeks after it first appeared. The gull colony has been particularly important in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and the gulls have had much more of an impact on plant colonisation than other breeding species due to their abundance. An expedition in 2004 found the first evidence of nesting Atlantic puffins, which are extremely common {{in the rest of the}} archipelago.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{a home for}} some species of birds, Surtsey has also {{been used as a}} stopping-off point for migrating birds, particularly those en-route between Europe and Iceland. Species that have been seen <b>briefly</b> <b>on</b> the island include whooper swans, various species of geese, and common ravens. Although Surtsey lies {{to the west of the}} main migration routes to Iceland, it has become a more common stopping point as its vegetation has improved. In 2008, the 14th bird species was detected with the discovery of a common raven's nest.|$|E
5|$|Before {{joining the}} Football League, Arsenal played <b>briefly</b> <b>on</b> Plumstead Common, {{then at the}} Manor Ground in Plumstead, then spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby Invicta Ground. Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club {{returned}} to the Manor Ground and installed stands and terracing, upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for {{the next twenty years}} (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.|$|E

5|$|The Admiral {{class would}} have been the only British ships capable of taking on the German Mackensen class; nevertheless, German {{shipbuilding}} was drastically slowed by the war, and while two Mackensens were launched, none were ever completed. The Germans also worked <b>briefly</b> <b>on</b> a further three ships, of the , which were modified versions of the Mackensens with 15-inch guns. Work on the three additional Admirals was suspended in March 1917 to enable more escorts and merchant ships to be built to deal with the new threat from U-boats to trade. They were finally cancelled in February 1919.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} in India continued to deteriorate {{throughout the summer}} and autumn of 1947. Nevertheless, Ismay and Mountbatten had agreed that Ismay would remain in his position for only {{three to four months}} after partition. In December 1947, he left India to return to England. Shortly after his return, Ismay served <b>briefly</b> <b>on</b> the British delegation to the United Nations to deal with the Kashmir issue. Ismay played only a limited role, as the Pakistanis suspected him of pro-Indian sympathies.|$|E
5|$|To {{a limited}} extent, the Kootenay River {{has also been}} used for {{navigation}}. Commercial navigation began with steamboats in the 19th century to transport ores, lumber, passengers and other imported and exported products between the Kootenay River valley and the Canadian Pacific Railway station at Golden, British Columbia. Boat travel on the upper river ceased when a rail line was built along the Kootenay upstream of the big bend. Steamboats also operated <b>briefly</b> <b>on</b> the lower river and Kootenay Lake to service silver mines in the nearby mountains.|$|E

5|$|Endeavour then resumed her course northward and {{parallel}} to the reef, the crew looking for a safe harbour in which to make repairs. On 13 June, the ship came to a broad watercourse that Cook named the Endeavour River. Cook attempted to enter the river mouth, but strong winds and rain prevented Endeavour from crossing the bar until the morning of 17 June. She grounded <b>briefly</b> <b>on</b> a sand spit but was refloated an hour later and warped into the river proper by early afternoon. The ship was promptly beached on the southern bank and careened to make repairs to the hull. Torn sails and rigging were also replaced and the hull scraped free of barnacles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the night}} sky, Betelgeuse {{is easy to}} spot {{with the naked eye}} owing to its {{distinctive}} orange-red color. In the Northern Hemisphere, beginning in January of each year, it can be seen rising in the east just after sunset. By mid-September to mid-March (best in mid-December), it is visible to virtually every inhabited region of the globe, except for a few research stations in Antarctica at latitudes south of 82°. In May (moderate northern latitudes) or June (southern latitudes), the red supergiant can be seen <b>briefly</b> <b>on</b> the western horizon after sunset, reappearing again a few months later on the eastern horizon before sunrise. In the intermediate period (June–July) it is invisible to the naked eye (visible only with a telescope in daylight), unless around midday (when the Sun is below horizon) on Antarctic regions between 70° and 80° south latitude.|$|E
5|$|Michaels made {{occasional}} appearances as the WWF Commissioner {{during the}} spring and summer of 1999, but remained absent from television after August until May 15, 2000, when he returned on Raw Is War to declare himself the special guest referee for The Rock and Triple H's Iron Man match at Judgment Day. One month later, Michaels briefly reappeared on Raw Is Wae to hand over the role of Commissioner to Mick Foley and after another appearance in October he did not make any in-ring appearances until mid-2002, although he appeared <b>briefly</b> <b>on</b> television to make a speech at WWF New York during Armageddon in December 2000. Michaels also had no part at all in the Invasion storyline.|$|E

5|$|On January 21, 2015, {{a mobile}} game titled Evolve: Hunter Quest {{appeared}} <b>briefly</b> <b>on</b> the iOS App Store {{and was later}} removed. The game was released by 2K on January 29, 2015 for iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Fire OS devices. The game is a free-to-play tile-matching video game, {{as well as a}} companion app to Evolve. In Evolve: Hunter Quest, players match three tokens of the same colour in order to unleash attacks on enemies, fill up energy bars to activate special Hunter abilities and earn mastery points to level up. Mastery points earned in-app can then be applied to characters in the main Evolve game on any platform. Players who download the app can also unlock unique game art and watch replays of online matches from a top-down view.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{remained}} at Princeton to do graduate work; he and Allen Shenstone {{were the only}} graduate students in the Department of Physics. Smyth earned a master's degree and Ph.D. in physics from Princeton in 1920 and 1921, respectively, studying under Karl Taylor Compton. The U.S. National Research Council awarded Smyth a fellowship, and he joined the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. There he studied under Ernest Rutherford and earned a second Ph.D. in 1923. At Cambridge he was affiliated with Caius College and formed a friendship with Pyotr Kapitsa, a Soviet physicist who {{would go on to}} win the Nobel Prize in Physics and work <b>briefly</b> <b>on</b> the Soviet atomic bomb project.|$|E
5|$|Steamboats {{operated}} <b>briefly</b> <b>on</b> {{the large}} lakes {{of the upper}} basin, contributing {{to the growth of}} towns such as Klamath Falls, Oregon, before they were replaced by railroads in the late 19thcentury. In the 19th and 20thcenturies, the upper basin became a productive agricultural region, and many dams were built to provide irrigation and hydroelectricity. In the 1960s, the Klamath River was targeted by much larger, but ultimately unsuccessful schemes to augment water supplies in other parts of California. One of these projects, the Klamath Diversion, would have reversed the entire flow of the Klamath River to supply farms and urban areas in central and southern California.|$|E
