25|$|In {{his book}} Stalin’s Slave Ships, Martin Bollinger {{examined}} {{the evidence and}} found that the Dzhurma did not enter service in the Dalstroi until 1935 and was not <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> 12,000 prisoners. Bollinger estimated that the ship, if overcrowded, would be able to hold up to 6,500 prisoners. In addition, there are no accounts that this ship, which was not strengthened for Arctic travel, made the journey north through the Bering Strait to Ambarchik. Thus the alleged event has been proven not to be true. He suggested this could possibly be the case of a mistaken identity involving the cargo ship Khabarovsk that, if it had been carrying passengers had already had opportunity to deposit them at Ambarchik, and was trapped by ice when returning from Ambarchik in the 1933–34 winter.|$|E
500|$|Besides his further general remarks, Hazlitt lingers appreciatively over {{a number}} of amusing scenes and poetic passages, {{including}} the songs, all showing how [...] "Shakespear's comedy is of a pastoral and poetical cast. Folly is indigenous to the soil [...] Absurdity has every encouragement afforded it; and nonsense has room to flourish in." [...] Characters of vastly different types are all welcome and fit into his scheme: [...] "the same house is <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> Malvolio, the Countess, Maria, Sir Toby, and Sir Andrew Ague-cheek." [...] He particularly admires the character of Viola, whom Shakespeare gives many speeches of [...] "impassioned sweetness". Characterising the play as a whole by quoting the author's own words in it—"Shakespear alone could describe the effect of his own poetry."—he reflects that the play's poetry comes o'er the ear like the sweet south/That breathes upon a bank of violets,/Stealing and giving odour.|$|E

2500|$|Shropshire batted {{first at}} Whitchurch, making only 132 as Shane Warne and Richard Logan took 3 wickets each.

500|$|In the 200-meter {{butterfly}} semi-finals, Tarwater {{turned in}} the second-fastest time behind Bobby Bollier as Phelps conserved energy. In the finals the next day, Tarwater, knowing he was facing several strong finishers, decided to go out {{as hard as he}} could and try <b>to</b> build a <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> lead <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> on. Tarwater led the field for the first 100 meters. [...] Phelps passed him in the third 50-meter stretch, but Tarwater held off the rest of the field until the final 25 meters when both Bollier and Tyler Clary surged ahead, dropping Tarwater to fourth. His split on the final 50 meters was three seconds slower than his third 50, and two seconds slower than his final lap in 2008. A couple days later, Tarwater advanced to the 100-meter butterfly final, but finished fifth. [...] Afterwards, he called it [...] "the last race I'll ever swim." ...|$|R

500|$|Charles {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by the works of Louis XIV of France, imitating French design at his palace at Winchester and the Royal Hospital at Chelsea. At Windsor, Charles created [...] "the most extravagantly Baroque interiors ever executed in England". Much of the building work was paid for out of increased royal revenues from Ireland during the 1670s. French court etiquette at the time required {{a substantial number of}} enfiladed rooms to satisfy court protocol; the demand for space forced architect Hugh May to expand out into the North Terrace, rebuilding and widening it in the process. This new building was called the Star Building, because Charles II placed a huge gilt Garter star on the side of it. May took down and rebuilt the walls of Edward III's hall and chapel, incorporating larger windows but retaining the height and dimensions of the medieval building. Although Windsor Castle was now <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the entire court, it was not built with chambers for the King's Council, as would be found in Whitehall. Instead Charles took advantage of the good road links emerging around Windsor to hold his council meetings at Hampton Court when he was staying at the castle. The result became an [...] "exemplar" [...] for royal buildings for the next twenty-five years. The result of May's work showed a medievalist leaning; although sometimes criticised for its [...] "dullness", May's reconstruction was both sympathetic to the existing castle and a deliberate attempt to create a slightly austere 17th-century version of a [...] "neo-Norman" [...] castle.|$|E
500|$|Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly {{was also}} positive, writing that Beyoncé [...] "pants and sweats and grunts (except, you know, sexy-like), her voice {{climbing}} ever higher {{in search of}} an octave <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> it". Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that [...] "" [...] if sung by anyone else, 'I Miss You' would be a thin wisp of a ballad, but Beyoncé allows her voice to crack at the right moments, moving tenuously, self-consciously through the soft, circular melody." [...] He concluded that songs like [...] "I Miss You" [...] and [...] "Start Over" [...] would earn deserved spots in [...] "the Beyoncé pantheon" [...] once fans take the time to grow attached to them. Andrew Unterberger of PopCrush praised the way Beyoncé delivers the line [...] "Why is that?", writing that it is [...] "a nice little nod to the confusion of heartbreak, and a rare, welcome glimpse of vulnerability for an artist who too often seems to have all of the answers." [...] Referring to [...] "I Miss You", Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that [...] "the 80s influence is not always a bad thing." [...] He considered the song to be [...] "a woozy update of an old-fashioned slow jam", further stating that [...] "it is probably pushing it a bit to call it an R equivalent of Ariel Pink's hypnagogic pop, but there's something enveloping and dream-like about it." [...] Ian Walker of AbsolutePunk commented that [...] " [...] hollow beat and dismal synthesizers, allow Beyoncé and her morosely beautiful voice center stage. [...] Beyoncé delivers a believable performance effortlessly." [...] By contrast, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune was negative, writing that [...] " [...] easily overlooked with its forlorn keyboard and beat-box chintziness." [...] Similarly, Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan felt that the ballad is [...] "too-saccharine-for-its-own-good." [...] The Guardians critics Ben Beaumont Thomas and Rebecca Nicholson ranked [...] "I Miss You" [...] at numbers four and nine respectively on their lists of The 10 Best Tracks of 2011.|$|E

50|$|The fancy Palacio Chino {{opened in}} march 29, 1940. It used {{the shell of}} a former ball court, whose space was {{sufficient}} for a big movie theatre. It {{was the only one}} built ever in Mexico in chinese style, but unlike the Grauman’s Chinese, the interior was of the atmospheric type. In 1945 it was listed as having 4000 seats in two levels, orchestra and balcony. It featured a fairly <b>big</b> stage, <b>enough</b> so <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a symphony orchestra, and indeed was sometimes used as a music theater. Celibidache once directed the National Symphony Orchestra here, as an alternate theater to Bellas Artes, itself the home theater of said orchestra. The inevitable comparation with Grauman’s Chinese stands only as original inspiration goes, because both buildings are very different. The Palacio Chino has a big, traditional flat facade, right in front of Iturbide street. The many windows of this facade are adorned as small pagodas, and there is a big, ornate marquee. The vestibule was spacious and full of chinese decorations, even the ticket boots were rendered as pagodas. The auditorium was of the atmospheric type, with pagodas, temples and gold Buddha statues amid gardens. The ceiling was vault-like, not flat but very arched, and of course was painted deep blue. The screen was protected by a heavy black curtain, with chinese motifs painted upon. The screen arch was very heavily decorated, with dragons appearing here and there.|$|R
60|$|October 10th.--This morning, too, {{we went to}} the cathedral, and sat long {{listening}} to the music of the organ and voices, and witnessing rites and ceremonies which are far older than even the ancient edifice where they were exhibited. A good many people were present, sitting, kneeling, or walking about,--a freedom that contrasts very agreeably with the grim formalities of English churches and our own meeting-houses. Many persons were in their best attire; but others came in, with unabashed simplicity, in their old garments of labor, sunburnt women from their toil among the vines and olives. One old peasant I noticed with his withered shanks in breeches and blue yarn stockings. The people of whatever class are wonderfully tolerant of heretics, never manifesting any displeasure or annoyance, though they must see that we are drawn thither by curiosity alone, and merely pry while they pray. I heartily wish the priests were better men, and that human nature, divinely influenced, could be depended upon for a constant supply and succession of good and pure ministers, their religion has so many admirable points. And then it is a sad pity that this noble and beautiful cathedral should be a mere fossil shell, out of which the life has died long ago. But for many a year yet to come the tapers will burn before the high altar, the Host will be elevated, the incense diffuse its fragrance, the confessionals be open to receive the penitents. I saw a father entering with two little bits of boys, just <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> toddle along, <b>holding</b> his hand on either side. The father dipped his fingers into the marble font of holy water,--which, on its pedestals, was two or three times as high as those small Christians, --and wetted a hand of each, and taught them how to cross themselves. When they come to be men it will be impossible to convince those children that there is no efficacy in holy water, without plucking up all religious faith and sentiment by the roots. Generally, I suspect, when people throw off the faith they were born in, the best soil of their hearts is apt to cling to its roots.|$|R
2500|$|On 29 June {{the armed}} constabulary began arresting the ploughmen. Large squads pounced on the {{ploughing}} parties, who offered no resistance. Dozens a day were arrested, but their places were immediately taken by {{others who had}} travelled {{from as far away}} as Waikanae. Te Whiti directed that those of the greatest mana, or prestige, should be the first to put their hands to the ploughshares, so among the first arrested were the prominent figures Titokowaru, Te Iki and Matakatea. As Taranaki jails became full, ploughmen were sent to the Mt Cook barracks in Wellington. By August almost 200 prisoners had been taken. By then, however, the protest action seemed to be having some success, with Sheehan, the Native Minister, telling Parliament on 23 July: [...] "I was not aware ...what the exact position of those lands on the west coast was. It has only been made clear to us by the interruption of the surveys. It turns out that from the White Cliffs to Waitotara the whole country is strewn with unfulfilled promises." [...] A former Native Minister, Dr Daniel Pollen, also warned of the consequences of firmer government action against the Parihaka ploughmen: [...] "I warn my honourable friend that there are behind Te Whiti not two hundred men, but a great many times two hundred men." [...] All the prisons of New Zealand would not be <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> them, he warned.|$|E

5000|$|Leicestershire {{themselves}} {{struggled in}} reply, and Somerset took wickets regularly, reducing the hosts to 70 for 7. However, {{they were not}} able to take another, as Leicestershire ended on 96 for 7 - Ottis Gibson and Claude Henderson adding 26 for the eighth wicket, Leicestershire's highest partnership of the match. (Cricinfo scorecard)----The first day at The Grange saw no play because of rain. After losing the toss, Scotland were put in, and the bowlers immediately made it very difficult for Scotland. It took them six overs to make their first ten runs, and every time they tried to accelerate, they lost wickets. In the end, they could only muster 134 all out in 46.5 overs. Vikram Solanki and Stephen Moore made this target look easy, passing the required 135 runs without losing a wicket in 5 balls fewer than 20 overs. Both batsmen made half-centuries.

This was never a <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> target <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> off Hampshire.

(Cricinfo scorecard)----Last year, Surrey were knocked out in Round One of this Trophy by Ireland, and so they would have come to Leek determined to avoid the same ignominy this time round. Staffordshire did push them hard, however. Staffordshire batted first, and made 186, with 23 wides showing how inaccurate the Surrey bowling was. In reply, ex-Middlesex bowler, David Follett, took 3 for 13 to reduce Surrey to a worrying 47 for 4. Then Mark Ramprakash came in, who steaded the Surrey ship with 49, before he was run out, leaving Surrey 45 to win off 62 balls with 4 wickets left. Rikki Clarke and Martin Bicknell got most of them, as Surrey won with 192 for 7 with 7 balls to go, Bicknell winning the game with a six. (Cricinfo scorecard)----After rain, play only began at 3pm at Bury St Edmunds with Glamorgan batting first. The highlight of their innings was an undefeated 100 from Matthew Elliott in 104 balls, with his partners contributing usefully as the visitors racked up an imposing 320 for 5. Suffolk were never in contention, and to spare the need for the match going into a second day, play continued in near-darkness to 8.40pm, with Glamorgan bowling their last 32 overs (all with spin, in order to make conditions playable for batsmen) in 80 minutes. Staffordshire finally finished on 177 for 8 off their 50 overs, recovering from 69 for 6. (Cricinfo scorecard)----After a four-and-a-half hour rain delay, Wales Minor Counties batted first at Swansea, and fared poorly. The only score of any note came from Willy Bragg, an 18-year-old left-hander, currently {{in the middle of his}} A-Level exams. He made an undefeated 41 runs, as Wales Minor Counties were dismissed for 119. Mark Ealham took 4 for 28 and Andrew Harris 3 for 31.
