40|$|This article {{addresses}} the processing and ageing properties of jute fiber reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites. The composite has been manufactured by a continuous extrusion {{process and results}} in free flowing composite granules, comprising up to 50 weight percent (wt %) jute fiber in PP. These granules have similar shape and diameter as commercially available PP granules. Rheological analysis shows that viscosity of the compounds follows the same shear rate dependency as PP {{and is on the}} same level as glass-PP compounds. The mechanical properties show very little variation and exhibit strength and stiffness values at the upper range of competing natural fiber reinforced compounds for injection molding. The mechanical performance reduces gradually upon prolonged thermal loading and immersion in water. The low water diffusion coefficient of the 50 wt % jute-PP composites indicates that the fibers are not forming a continuous network throughout the polymer. The jute fibers exhibit a stabilizing effect against ultra violet irradiation (UV) on PP polymer and, as a consequence, the mechanical properties of jute-PP composites hardly decrease during an accelerated UV ageing test. Bacteria, fungi, and garden mold grow easily on the compound material, but only have a limited effect on mechanical properties. The resistance to growth of bacteria on the materials surface can be increased using a <b>biostabilizer...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{colloidal}} {{synthesis of}} CdS nanoparticles with the <b>biostabilizers</b> cysteine and glutathione, respectively, at pH values ranging from 4 to 10 is described. For the adjustment of their UV/Vis absorption properties and hence their band gap energies, the Statistical Design of Experiments (DoE) was used. This method allows the simultaneous {{variation of the}} synthesis parameters in a systematic manner, and thereby synergistic interaction effects can be obtained. The band gap energies of the quantum dots can be tuned from 3. 32 to 4. 26 eV by varying kind and concentration of stabilizer, pH value, and concentration of sulfide source. The energy position is significantly dependent on {{the interaction between the}} pH value and the concentration of the stabilizer, and the effect of high glutathione concentration is opposite at acidic and alkaline conditions thus leading to band gaps of 4. 10 eV at pH = 6 and of 3. 64 eV at pH = 10. Examples for the synthesis of semiconductor nanoparticles with predefined spectroscopic properties and preset preparation conditions, e. g., alkaline conditions for the implementation of acid-sensitive dopants, are given...|$|R
