25|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>substitutes</b> (also called {{artificial}} blood or blood surrogates) are artificial substances aiming {{to provide an}} alternative to blood-based products acquired from donors. The main <b>blood</b> <b>substitutes</b> used today are volume expanders such as crystalloids and colloids mentioned above. Also, oxygen-carrying substitutes are emerging.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} blood {{substitutes}} have been explored (and still are), but thus far they all suffer from many challenges. Most {{attempts to find}} a suitable alternative to blood thus far have concentrated on cell-free hemoglobin solutions. Blood substitutes could make transfusions more readily available in emergency medicine and in pre-hospital EMS care. If successful, such a <b>blood</b> <b>substitute</b> could save many lives, particularly in trauma where massive blood loss results. Hemopure, a hemoglobin-based therapy, is approved for use in South Africa.|$|E
500|$|Classified by the Carnegie Foundation in 2016 {{as one of}} only 115 {{research}} universities with [...] "highest activity", Texas Tech University hosts 71 research centers and institutes. In 2008, {{a team of researchers}} from Texas Tech University and Harvard University announced the development of an siRNA-based treatment that may ultimately counteract the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Human cells infected with HIV, injected into rats, have been cured by the experimental treatment. Clinical trials on humans are expected to begin by 2010. Texas Tech researchers also hold the exclusive license for HemoTech, a human <b>blood</b> <b>substitute</b> composed of bovine hemoglobin. HemoBioTech, the company marketing the technology, believes HemoTech will diminish the intrinsic toxicities that have stifled previous attempts to develop a human <b>blood</b> <b>substitute.</b> On January 14, 2008, Texas Tech University announced the creation of the West Texas Influenza Research Center. The university has concluded human clinical testing of oral interferon in a five-year study of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and continues its study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.|$|E

The box turned out to contain packets of Hemopure, a bovine-hemoglobin-based <b>blood</b> <b>substitute</b> which is not currently approved for human use outside South Africa and did not become commercially available there until January 2006, and which might potentially have been used in a doping program.

5000|$|The idea {{to use a}} <b>blood</b> <b>substitute</b> is old as well {{as human}} {{intention}} to resuscitate a life with transfusion of real blood. In the past, many but often obscure trials were conducted. One recommendation from Sir Christopher Wren (17th century) who suggested wine and opium as <b>blood</b> <b>substitute</b> [...] At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, the development of modern transfusion medicine initiated through the excellent work of Landsteiner and co-authors opened the possibility to understanding the general principle of blood group serology. [...] Simultaneously, significant progress was made in the fields of heart and circulation physiology {{as well as in the}} understanding of the mechanism of oxygen transport and tissue oxygenation. These two points paved the way for blood transfusion to become a standard part of medical treatment. Complexity of blood compatibility, lack of suitable anticoagulants and insufficient storage methods combined with a disproportion between demand and availability implicated just in early phase of transfusion medicine needs to find one universal <b>blood</b> <b>substitute.</b> The term [...] "blood substitute" [...] is a misnomer. Under the term <b>blood</b> <b>substitute,</b> we understand in first line the substitution of a) facility of red blood cells e.g. haemoglobin as oxygen carriers and b) volume substitution. More accurately the term means [...] "red-cell substitutes" [...] or solutions of [...] "haemoglobin or non-haemoglobin based oxygen carriers".|$|E
