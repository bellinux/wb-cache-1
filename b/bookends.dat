5|$|<b>Bookends</b> is {{a concept}} album that explores a life journey from {{childhood}} to old age. Side one of the album marks successive stages in life, the theme serving as <b>bookends</b> to the life cycle. Side two largely consists of unused material for The Graduate soundtrack. Simon's lyrics concern youth, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality. Much of the material was crafted alongside producer John Simon, who joined the recording when Simon suffered from writer's block. The album was recorded gradually over the period of a year, with production speeding up around the later months of 1967.|$|E

Produced by Paul Simon, Roy Halee and Art Garfunkel, the album was {{released}} on April 3, 1968 in the United States by Columbia Records.

This edition attempted to follow as closely as possible the runtime and format of the original roadshow version, and included additional restored live-action footage of Taylor and the orchestra, including the <b>bookends</b> to the film's intermission. In the 2000 and 2010 releases, Deems Taylor's voice has been dubbed throughout by Corey Burton because most of the audio tracks to Taylor's restored scenes have been lost.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{sales for}} <b>Bookends</b> were {{substantial}} in the US, and the album produced the number-one single [...] "Mrs. Robinson". The album sold {{best in the}} US and in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number one. <b>Bookends</b> was considered a breakthrough for the duo, placing them {{on the same level}} as artists such as the Beatles, Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones {{at the forefront of the}} cultural movement in the 1960s. The album has continued to receive critical acclaim.|$|E
500|$|Later reviews {{were more}} positive. [...] "In just over 29 minutes, <b>Bookends</b> is {{stunning}} in its {{vision of a}} bewildered America in search of itself", said AllMusic writer Thom Jurek, who gave it five stars out of five. Pitchfork Media's Stephen M. Deusner called <b>Bookends</b> the moment in which the duo [...] "were settling into themselves, losing their folk revival pretensions and emphasizing quirky production techniques to match their soaring vocals". The A.V. Club called it the group's [...] "most musically and conceptually daring album".|$|E
500|$|<b>Bookends</b> was {{released}} by Columbia Records on April 3, 1968. In a historical context, this was just 24 hours before the assassination of Civil Rights Movement activist Martin Luther King, Jr., which spurred nationwide outrage and riots. Fornatale opines that the album served as [...] "comfort food" [...] during rather tumultuous times within the nation. The album debuted on the Billboard Pop Album Chart in the issue dated April 27, 1968, climbing to number one and staying at that position for seven non-consecutive weeks; it remained on the chart {{for a total of}} 66 weeks. <b>Bookends</b> received such heavy orders weeks in advance of its release that Columbia was able to apply for award certification before copies left the warehouse, a fact it touted in magazine ads. [...] The record became the duo's best-selling album to date: it fed off the buzz created by the release of The Graduate soundtrack album ten weeks earlier, creating an initial combined sales figure of over five million units. In the United Kingdom, <b>Bookends</b> was a number one hit. Likewise, the album charted highly in both Australia and France, where it peaked in both countries at number three.|$|E

500|$|Disc jockey {{and author}} Pete Fornatale writes that <b>Bookends</b> {{represents}} [...] "a once-in-a-career convergence of musical, personal, and societal forces that placed Simon & Garfunkel squarely {{at the center}} of the cultural zeitgeist of the sixties". Rolling Stone credited the record with striking a chord among lonely, adrift young adults near the end of the decade, writing that a lyric in [...] "A Hazy Shade of Winter" [...] — [...] "Time, time, time, see what’s become of me..." [...] — [...] "defined the moment for a generation on the edge of adulthood". Many viewed <b>Bookends</b> as the band's most accomplished work at the time, a breakthrough in production and songwriting. [...] "Bookends was our first serious piece of work, I'd say", said Simon in a 1984 interview with Playboy.|$|E
500|$|The duo's fourth studio album, <b>Bookends,</b> was {{recorded}} {{in fits and starts}} over various periods from late 1966 to early 1968. The duo were signed under an older contract that specified the label pay for sessions, and Simon & Garfunkel took advantage of this indulgence, hiring viola and brass players, as well as percussionists. The record's brevity reflects its concise and perfectionist production. The team spent over 50 studio hours recording [...] "Punky's Dilemma", for example, and re-recorded vocal parts, sometimes note by note, until they were satisfied. Garfunkel's songs and voice took a lead role on some of the songs, and the harmonies for which the duo was known gradually disappeared. For Simon, <b>Bookends</b> represented the end of the collaboration and became an early indicator of his intentions to go solo. Although the album had been planned long in advance, work did not begin in earnest until the late months of 1967.|$|E
500|$|They reunited, {{releasing}} {{their second}} studio album Sounds of Silence and touring colleges nationwide. On their third release, Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme (1966), the duo assumed more creative control.

500|$|Reviews of <b>Bookends</b> {{upon its}} release in 1968 were largely positive. Allen Evans of the British {{publication}} New Musical Express (NME) gave the record {{four out of}} five stars and called it [...] "inspiring, descriptive music," [...] while noting the album is [...] "Imaginative and at times confusing to know what the composer is getting at, if anything." [...] Rival newspaper Melody Maker did not use a ratings system, but called <b>Bookends</b> a [...] "thoughtful, clever and well-produced album." [...] Reviewer Chris Welch criticized the songs as [...] "not particularly tuneful," [...] but performed with [...] "Beatles fervour and Beatles conviction," [...] praising the lyricism, opining that [...] "The words capture part of America today, a lot of its sickness and tragedy." [...] In the US, Rolling Stone reviewer Arthur Schmidt wrote that [...] "The music is, for me, questionable, but I've always found their music questionable. It is nice enough, and I admit to liking it, but it exudes a sense of process, and it is slick, and nothing too much happens." ...|$|E
500|$|John Simon's {{work with}} the duo {{produced}} several tracks that ended up on <b>Bookends,</b> such as [...] "Punky's Dilemma", [...] "Save the Life of My Child", and [...] "Overs". In October 1967, Morgan Ames, writer for High Fidelity magazine, attended a recording session with the duo, Simon, Halee and an assistant engineer at Columbia's recording studio on 52nd Street in New York City. Her observations were reported in the November edition of the magazine: ...|$|E
