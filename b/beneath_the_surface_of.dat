5|$|Professor T. Bird and {{the three}} Battletoads, Rash, Zitz, and Pimple, are escorting Princess Angelica to her home planet using their spacecraft, the Vulture. Pimple and Angelica decide to take a leisurely trip on Pimple's flying car. They are ambushed and {{captured}} by the Dark Queen's ship, the Gargantua. Pimple sends out a distress signal to the Vulture, alerting Professor T. Bird, Rash, and Zitz that himself and Angelica had been captured. Learning that the Gargantua is hidden <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a nearby planet called Ragnarok's World, Professor T. Bird flies Rash and Zitz there in the Vulture to rescue them.|$|E
5|$|The Voyager 2 probe {{observed}} in 1989 {{a handful of}} geyser-like eruptions of nitrogen gas and entrained dust from <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> Triton in plumes up to 8km high. Triton is thus, along with Earth, Io, and Enceladus, {{one of the few}} bodies in the Solar System on which active eruptions of some sort have been observed. The best-observed examples are named Hili and Mahilani (after a Zulu water sprite and a Tongan sea spirit, respectively).|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} Ferelden, one {{of several}} {{countries}} in the fictional world of Thedas. Demonic creatures called the Darkspawn dwell within the Deep Roads, an underground highway system created by the dwarves long ago, deep <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> Thedas. Every few hundred years, the Darkspawn swarm the surface world in a movement known as a Blight. Ever since the first Blight, Thedas has relied on the legendary order of warriors known as the Grey Wardens to drive the Darkspawn back. Dragon Age: Origins begins {{on the eve of}} Thedas's fifth Blight.|$|E

5|$|Because Triton's surface {{indicates}} {{a long history}} of melting, models of its interior posit that Triton is differentiated, like Earth, into a solid core, a mantle and a crust. Water, the most abundant volatile in the Solar System, comprises Triton's mantle, enveloping a core of rock and metal. There is enough rock in Triton's interior for radioactive decay to power convection in the mantle to this day. The heat may even be sufficient to maintain a global subsurface ocean similar to what is hypothesized to exist <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> Europa. If liquid water is present in Triton, it has been speculated that this could make it habitable for some form of life.|$|E
5|$|Soldiers of {{the species}} Globitermes sulphureus commit suicide by autothysis– rupturing a large gland just <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> their cuticles. The thick, yellow fluid in the gland becomes very sticky on contact with the air, {{entangling}} ants or other insects which are trying to invade the nest. Another termite, Neocapriterme taracua, also engages in suicidal defence. Workers physically unable to use their mandibles while in a fight form a pouch full of chemicals, then deliberately rupture themselves, releasing toxic chemicals that paralyse and kill their enemies. The soldiers of the neotropical termite family Serritermitidae have a defence strategy which involves front gland autothysis, with the body rupturing between the head and abdomen. When soldiers guarding nest entrances are attacked by intruders, they engage in autothysis, creating a block that denies entry to any attacker.|$|E
5|$|The {{bivalves}} are {{a highly}} successful class of invertebrates found in aquatic habitats throughout the world. Most are infaunal and live buried in sediment on the seabed, or in the sediment in freshwater habitats. A large number of bivalve species {{are found in the}} intertidal and sublittoral zones of the oceans. A sandy sea beach may superficially appear to be devoid of life, but often {{a very large number of}} bivalves and other invertebrates are living <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the sand. On a large beach in South Wales, careful sampling produced an estimate of 1.44 million cockles (Cerastoderma edule) per acre of beach.|$|E

60|$|He was {{a slender}} brunette of a man, lean-cheeked, thin-lipped, and strong. The smooth-shaven {{face was a}} healthy sallow. All his {{movements}} were quick and precise. He did not fumble his cards. The eyes were black, direct, and piercing, with the trick of seeming to look <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> things. His hands, slender, fine and nervous, appeared made for delicate work, and to the most casual eye they conveyed an impression of strength.|$|R
500|$|The Galileo {{spacecraft}} was {{the first}} to enter orbit around Jupiter, arriving in 1995 and studying it until 2003. During this period, Galileo gathered a large amount of information about the Jovian system, making close approaches to all of the Galilean moons and finding evidence for thin atmospheres on three of them, as well as the possibility <b>of</b> liquid water <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. It also discovered a magnetic field around Ganymede.|$|R
5|$|Seething <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> American {{life in the}} Depression was {{the fear}} of the angry mob, portrayed in panicked {{hysteria}} in films such as Gabriel Over the White House (1933), The Mayor of Hell (1933), and American Madness (1932). Massive wide shots of angry hordes, comprising sometimes hundreds of men, rush into action in terrifyingly efficient uniformity. Groups of agitated men either standing in breadlines, loitering in hobo camps, or marching the streets in protest became a prevalent sight during the Great Depression. The Bonus Army protests of World War I veterans on the capital in Washington, D.C., on which Hoover unleashed a brutal crackdown, prompted many of the Hollywood depictions. Although social issues were examined more directly in the pre-Code era, Hollywood still largely ignored the Great Depression, as many films sought to ameliorate patrons' anxieties rather than incite them.|$|E
