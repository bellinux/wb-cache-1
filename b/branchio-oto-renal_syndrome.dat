40|$|A {{candidate}} gene for <b>Branchio-Oto-Renal</b> (BOR) <b>syndrome</b> was identified at chromosome 8 q 13. 3 by positional cloning and shown to underlie the disease.

40|$|<b>Branchio-oto-renal</b> (BOR) <b>syndrome</b> is {{characterized}} by ear malformations, cervical fistulas, hearing loss, and renal anomalies. It is an autosomal dominant disorder with variable clinical manifestations. The most common features of BOR syndrome are branchial, hearing, and renal anomalies. However, many affected subjects have been observed with branchial-cleft anomalies and hearing loss but without renal anomalies, a condition called "branchio-otic" (BO) syndrome. It is logical to question whether the BOR and BO syndromes are allelic or whether they represent distinct genetic entities. We identified a very large extended family whose members had branchial and hearing anomalies associated with commissural lip pits that segregated in an autosomal dominant fashion. Using a genomewide search strategy, we identified genetic linkage, with a maximum LOD score of 4. 81 at recombination fraction 0, between the BO phenotype and polymorphic marker D 1 S 2757 in the genetic region of chromosome 1 q 31. This is the first report of linkage for a second gene associated with BOR syndrome.

40|$|In {{addition}} to craniofacial, auricular, ophthalmologic, and oral anomalies, the distinctive phenotype of the branchio-oculo-facial (BOF) syndrome (MIM 113620) includes skin defects {{in the neck}} or infra/supra-auricular region. These unusual areas of thin, erythematous wrinkled skin differ from the discrete cervical pits, cysts, and fistulas of the <b>branchio-oto-renal</b> (BOR) <b>syndrome</b> (MIM 113650). Although the BOF and BOR syndromes are sufficiently distinctive {{that they should not}} be confused, both can be associated with nasolacrimal duct stenosis, deafness, prehelical pits, malformed pinna, and renal anomalies. Furthermore, a reported father and son [Legius et al., 1990, Clin Genet 37 : 347 - 500] had features of both conditions. It was not clear whether they had an atypical presentation of either BOR or BOF syndrome, or represented a private syndrome. In light of these issues, we selected the BOR locus (EYA 1) as a possible gene mutation for the BOF syndrome. In five BOF patients, there were no mutations detected in the EYA 1 gene, suggesting that it is not allelic to the BOR syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Eyes absent (EYA) {{proteins}} {{are defined}} by a conserved C-terminal EYA domain (ED) that both contributes to its function as a transcriptional coactivator by mediating protein-protein interactions and possesses intrinsic protein tyrosine phosphatase activity. Mutations in human EYA 1 result in an autosomal dominant disorder called <b>branchio-oto-renal</b> (BOR) <b>syndrome</b> as well as congenital cataracts and ocular defects (OD). Both BOR- and OD-associated missense mutations alter residues in the conserved ED as do three missense mutations identified from Drosophila eya alleles. To investigate the molecular mechanisms whereby these mutations disrupt EYA function, we tested their activity {{in a series of}} assays that measured in vivo function, phosphatase activity, transcriptional capability, and protein-protein interactions. We find that the OD-associated mutations retain significant in vivo activity whereas those derived from BOR patients show a striking decrease or loss of in vivo functionality. Protein-protein interactions, either with its partner transcription factor Sine oculis or with EYA itself, were not significantly compromised. Finally, the results of the biochemical assays suggest that both loss of protein tyrosine phosphatase activity and reduced transcriptional capability contribute to the impaired EYA function associated with BOR/OD syndrome, thus shedding new light into the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease...|$|R
40|$|Introduction  <b>Branchio-oto-renal</b> (BOR) <b>syndrome</b> is an autosomal-dominant genetic {{condition}} with high penetrance and variable expressivity, {{with an estimated}} prevalence of 1 in 40, 000. Approximately 40 % of the patients with the syndrome have mutations in the gene EYA 1, located at chromosomal region 8 q 13. 3, and 5 % have mutations in the gene SIX 5 in chromosome region 19 q 13. The phenotype of this syndrome is characterized by preauricular fistulas; structural malformations of the external, middle, and inner ears; branchial fistulas; renal disorders; cleft palate; and variable type and degree of hearing loss. Aim  Hearing loss is part of BOR syndrome phenotype. The {{aim of this study}} was to present a literature review on the anatomical aspects and audiological profile of BOR syndrome. Data Synthesis  Thirty-four studies were selected for analysis. Some aspects when specifying the phenotype of BOR syndrome are controversial, especially those issues related to the audiological profile in which there was variability on auditory standard, hearing loss progression, and type and degree of the hearing loss. Mixed loss was the most common type of hearing loss among the studies; however, there was no consensus among studies regarding the degree of the hearing loss...|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of multicystic dysplastic kidney {{is a result}} of an abnormal induction of metanephric mesenchyme. This could be a result of a formation difficulty of the mesonephric duct. Some mutations in genes associated with renal dysplasia (in syndromes)have been determined. The mutations in question occur at EYA1 or SIX1 genes (<b>branchio-oto-renal</b> <b>syndrome).</b> The PAX2 gene is also thought {{to play a role in}} MCDK.|$|E
50|$|The {{system of}} tissue {{induction}} between the ureteric bud and the metanephric blastema is a reciprocal control system.

Mutations in the EYA1 gene, which is a GDNF transcription factor, lead to the renal abnormalities of BOR syndrome (<b>branchio-oto-renal</b> <b>syndrome).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} and/or {{signs of}} <b>branchio-oto-renal</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{are consistent with}} underdeveloped (hypoplastic) or absent kidneys with resultant renal insufficiency or renal failure. Ear anomalies include extra openings {{in front of the}} ears, extra pieces of skin in front of the ears (preauricular tags), or further malformation or absence of the outer ear (pinna). Malformation or absence of the middle ear is also possible, individuals can have mild to profound hearing loss. People with BOR may also have cysts or fistulae along the sides of their neck.|$|E
40|$|<b>Branchio-oto-renal</b> (BOR) <b>syndrome</b> is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder {{characterized by the}} coexistence of branchial cysts or fistulae, external ear malformation with pre-auricular pits or tags, hearing impairment and renal malformations.

Here, we present a 16 -year-old boy admitted to the Department of Nephrology at the Pediatric Clinic, University Clinical Center of Kosovo, Pristina, Republic of Kosovo because of severe renal insufficiency diagnosed 6 years ago, which progressed to end-stage renal failure. Clinical examination on readmission showed a pale, lethargic and edematous child, with auricular deformity, pre-auricular tags and pits as well as bilateral branchial fistulae. Laboratory tests revealed high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 15. 96 mmol/L and serum creatinine 633. 0 µmol/L; low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 12 mL/min. / 1. 73 m 2 and massive proteinuria 4 +. Abdominal ultrasound showed bilateral kidney hypoplasia. A novel mutation of the EYA 1 gene was confirmed. Daily hemodialysis is continuing until renal transplantation is done. This case is presented to increase awareness among general practitioners to consider BOR syndrome or other renal abnormalities in patients with branchial fistula and/ or external ear anomalies or similar findings in other family members...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} results of {{petrosal}} bone imaging and audiometric long-term follow-up of two patients with <b>branchio-oto-renal</b> (BOR) <b>syndrome</b> and relate them to the clinical features, including caloric responses. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal case study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A father and son with the BOR syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Both patients underwent imaging studies to detect and evaluate inner ear anomalies. Longitudinal audiometric analysis of the hearing threshold data over the previous 23 years was performed. Caloric tests were performed at various ages. RESULTS: The son had a short, wide internal acoustic canal, a hypoplastic cochlea, a plump vestibule, and a wide vestibular aqueduct on both sides; the semicircular canals and endolymphatic sac were of normal size. He showed progressive fluctuant sensorineural hearing loss. Caloric tests disclosed hyporeflexia on the left side. The father had a plump internal acoustic canal and hypoplastic cochlea on both sides. The left vestibule was hypoplastic, and the left vestibular aqueduct was marginally enlarged. He showed severe hearing impairment, without substantial progression or fluctuation, and caloric areflexia on the left side. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a correlation between progressive fluctuant sensorineural hearing loss with caloric hypofunction {{and the presence of}} an enlarged vestibular aqueduct in the BOR syndrome. Additional longitudinal case studies are needed to further evaluate such a correlation...|$|R
40|$|Background <b>Branchio-oto-renal</b> (BOR) <b>syndrome</b> is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder characterized by branchial, ear, and renal anomalies. The most common gene mutated in BOR patients is EYA 1, the human homolog of the Drosophila eyes absent gene, while mutations in SIX 1 gene, the human homolog of sine oculis, encoding a DNA binding protein interacting with EYA 1, {{have been reported}} less frequently. Recently, mutations in another SIX family member, SIX 5, have been described in BOR patients, however, this association has not been confirmed by other groups. Case presentation In this study, we have clinically and genetically characterized a proband that displayed hearing loss, pre-auricular pits, branchial fistulae, hypoplasia of the left kidney, bilateral mild hydronephrosis, progressive proteinuria and focal glomerulosclerosis. Mutational analysis of EYA 1 gene revealed a novel splice site mutation, c. 1475 + 1 G>C, that affects EYA 1 splicing and produces an aberrant mRNA transcript, lacking exon 15, which is predicted to encode a truncated protein of 456 aa. Conclusion This report provided the functional description of a novel EYA 1 splice site mutation and described {{for the first time}} a case of BOR syndrome associated with the atypical renal finding of focal glomerulosclerosis, highlighting the importance of molecular testing and detailed clinical evaluation to provide accurate diagnosis and appropriate genetic counselling.

50|$|The {{genetics}} of <b>branchio-oto-renal</b> <b>syndrome</b> indicate it is inherited in an {{autosomal dominant}} manner, and {{results from a}} mutation in the EYA1 gene. Autosomal dominant inheritance indicates that the defective gene responsible for a disorder is located on an autosome, and only one copy of the gene is sufficient to cause the disorder, when inherited from a parent who has the disorder.

5000|$|Hearing loss {{associated}} with Mondini dysplasia may first become manifest in childhood or early adult life.

Vestibular function is also often affected. While the hearing loss is sensorineural a conductive element may exist probably because of the third window effect of the widened vestibular aqueduct.

50|$|While genetic {{research}} has linked certain genetic mutations {{to be the}} cause of ARPKD, ADPKD and possibly MRD, to date no genetic mutation or chromosomal anomaly has been linked to {{be the cause of}} BRA. Chromosomal anomalies have been associated with BRA in certain cases (chromosomes 1, 2, 5 and 21), but these anomalies were not inherited and have not been observed in subsequent cases. Additionally, neither extreme substance abuse or environmental factors (high power line, mercury, etc.) have been reported to be linked to an increased incidence of BRA or other cause of Potter sequence. BRA and other causes of oligohydramnios sequence have been linked to a number of other problems, to include Down syndrome, Kallmann syndrome, <b>branchio-oto-renal</b> <b>syndrome</b> and others.|$|E
40|$|Allele {{variants}} of EYA 1 and EYA 4, {{two members of}} the vertebrate Eya gene family, underlie two types of inherited human deafness, <b>branchio-oto-renal</b> (BOR) <b>syndrome</b> and DFNA 10, respectively. To clarify how mutations in these two genes and their encoded proteins impact the normal biology of hearing, we completed a number of functional studies using the yeast-two-hybrid system. We verified that bait constructs of the homologous region (Eya 1 HR and Eya 4 HR) interact with Six 1 prey constructs, although no interaction with Dach 1 prey was demonstrable. To compare interaction affinities, we evaluated -galactosidase activity after cotransformation of Eya 1 HR/Six 1 and Eya 4 HR/Six 1 and found that the latter interaction was weaker. By immunofluorescence staining, we showed Eya 4 HR localization to the cytoplasm. After coexpression of Six 1, Eya 4 HR was translocated to the nucleus. Results with Eya 1 HR were similar. Translation of mutant constructs (Eya 4 HR R 564 X and Eya 1 HR R 539 X) could not be demonstrated. Using dual Eya-containing constructs (with two wild-type alleles or wild-type and mutant alleles), we confirmed no translation of the mutant allele, even if the mutation was nontruncating. These results are consistent with clinical data and implicate haploinsufficiency as the cause of BOR syndrome and DFNA 10...|$|R
40|$|Urinary tract malformations {{constitute}} {{the most frequent}} cause of chronic renal failure {{in the first two}} decades of life. Branchio-otic (BO) syndrome is an autosomal dominant developmental disorder characterized by hearing loss. In <b>branchio-oto-renal</b> (BOR) <b>syndrome,</b> malformations of the kidney or urinary tract are associated. Haploinsufficiency for the human gene EYA 1, a homologue of the Drosophila gene eyes absent (eya), causes BOR and BO syndromes. We recently mapped a locus for BOR/BO syndrome (BOS 3) to human chromosome 14 q 23. 1. Within the 33 -megabase critical genetic interval, we located the SIX 1, SIX 4, and SIX 6 genes, which act within a genetic network of EYA and PAX genes to regulate organogenesis. These genes, therefore, represented excellent candidate genes for BOS 3. By direct sequencing of exons, we identified three different SIX 1 mutations in four BOR/BO kindreds, thus identifying SIX 1 as a gene causing BOR and BO syndromes. To elucidate how these mutations cause disease, we analyzed the functional role of these SIX 1 mutations with respect to protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions. We demonstrate that all three mutations are crucial for Eya 1 –Six 1 interaction, and the two mutations within the homeodomain region are essential for specific Six 1 –DNA binding. Identification of SIX 1 mutations as causing BOR/BO offers insights into the molecular basis of otic and renal developmental diseases in humans...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in {{the human}} EYA 1 gene have been {{associated}} with several human diseases including branchio-oto (BO) and <b>branchio-oto-renal</b> (BOR) <b>syndrome,</b> as well as congenital cataracts and ocular anterior segment anomalies. BOR patients suffer from severe malformations of the ears, branchial arches and kidneys. The phenotype of Eya 1 -heterozygous mice resembles the symptoms of human patients suffering from BOR syndrome. The Eya 1 gene encodes a multifunctional protein that acts as a protein tyrosine phosphatase and a transcriptional coactivator. It has been shown that Eya 1 interacts with Six transcription factors, which are also required for nuclear translocation of the Eya 1 protein. We investigated the effects of seven disease-causing Eya 1 missense mutations on Eya 1 protein function, in particular cellular localization, ability to interact with Six proteins, and protein stability. We show here that the BOR-associated Eya 1 missense mutations S 454 P, L 472 R, and L 550 P lead to enhanced proteasomal degradation of the Eya 1 protein in mammalian cells. Moreover, Six proteins lead to a significant stabilization of Eya 1, which is caused by Six-mediated protection from proteasomal degradation. In case of the mutant L 550 P, loss of interaction with Six proteins leads to rapid protein degradation. Our observations suggest that protein destabilization constitutes a novel disease causing mechanism for Eya 1...|$|R

40|$|Haploinsufficiency of Eya 1 {{causes the}} <b>branchio-oto-renal</b> (BOR) <b>syndrome,</b> and {{abnormally}} {{high levels of}} Eya 1 are linked to breast cancer progression and poor prognosis. Therefore, regulation of Eya 1 activity is key to its tissue-specific functions and oncogenic activities. Here, we show that Eya 1 is posttranslationally modified by ubiquitin and that its ubiquitination level is self-limited to prevent premature degradation. Eya 1 has an evolutionarily conserved CDC 4 phosphodegron (CPD) signal, a target site of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK 3) kinase and Fbw 7 ubiquitin ligase, which is required for Eya 1 ubiquitination. Genetic deletion of Fbw 7 and pharmacological inhibition of GSK 3 significantly decrease Eya 1 ubiquitination. Conversely, activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt and the canonical Wnt signal suppresses Eya 1 ubiquitination. Compound Eya 1 /;Wnt 9 b/mutants exhibit an increased penetrance of renal defect, indicating that they function in the same genetic pathway in vivo. Together, these findings reveal that the canonical Wnt and PI 3 K/Akt signal pathways restrain the GSK 3 /Fbw 7 -dependent Eya 1 ubiquitination, and they further suggest that dysregulation of this novel axis contributes to tumorigenesis. The name of the eyes absent (eya) gene tells only a partial tale. Indeed, it is required for development of and is capable of inducing the ectopic Drosophila eye (1 – 3). The function of mam-malian Eya family proteins, however, expands beyond organogen-esis (4 – 6), from tumorigenesis (7 – 10) to tissue remodeling (11, 12) to innate immunity (13).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{inventory}} computed tomographic {{and magnetic}} resonance imaging findings in the <b>branchio-oto-renal</b> (BOR) <b>syndrome.</b> STUDY DESIGN: A prospective computed tomographic and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} study on a family with the BOR syndrome. SETTING: Department of medical imaging and magnetic resonance imaging at St. Jan Brugge, Brugge, Belgium. PATIENTS: Eight affected members of a Belgian family. Younger affected family members {{were excluded because of}} their age. RESULTS: Computed tomography showed inner ear malformations in all eight affected patients. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on five patients and showed inner ear malformations. To define hypoplasia or congenital enlargement of the inner ear structures, measurements obtained from a control group of normal subjects were used for comparison. Almost symmetrical cochlear abnormalities were observed on the three-dimensional Fourier transformation-constructive interference in steady state images of the five patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging; four had dysplasia of the cochlea, and one had hypoplasia. The vestibule was slightly enlarged in one patient; computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed semicircular canal malformations. Magnetic resonance imaging clearly showed bilateral enlarged endolymphatic sacs and ducts, whereas computed tomography showed only unilateral widening of the vestibular aqueduct and borderline widening of the vestibular aqueduct. Magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral hypoplasia of the cochlear branch of the eighth nerve in one patient. CONCLUSION: Hypoplasia and dysplasia of the cochlea were consistent findings, and only magnetic resonance imaging was able to evaluate the intracochlear changes in detail and corrected computed tomography in most patients. Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging also detected bilateral hypoplasia of the cochlear branch of the eighth nerve in one patient. A widened vestibular aqueduct and a widened vestibular sac were frequent but not obligatory features of the BOR syndrome.

40|$|Dysfunction of the ureter {{often leads}} to urine flow {{impairment}} from the kidney to the bladder, causing dilation of the ureter and/or renal pelvis. Six 1 is a crucial regulator of renal development: mutations in human SIX 1 cause <b>branchio-oto-renal</b> (BOR) <b>syndrome</b> and Six 1 –/– mice exhibit renal agenesis, although the ureter is present. It remains unclear whether Six 1 {{plays a role in}} regulating ureter morphogenesis. We demonstrate here that Six 1 is differentially expressed during ureter morphogenesis. It was expressed in undifferentiated smooth muscle (SM) progenitors, but was downregulated in differentiating SM cells (SMCs) and had disappeared by E 18. 5. In Six 1 –/– mice, the ureteral mesenchymal precursors failed to condense and differentiate into normal SMCs and showed increased cell death, indicating that Six 1 is required for the maintenance and normal differentiation of SM progenitors. A delay in SMC differentiation was observed in Six 1 –/– ureters. A lack of Six 1 in the ureter led to hydroureter and hydronephrosis without anatomical obstruction when kidney formation was rescued in Six 1 –/– embryos by specifically expressing Six 1 in the metanephric mesenchyme, but not the ureter, under control of the Eya 1 promoter. We show that Six 1 and Tbx 18 genetically interact to synergistically regulate SMC development and ureter function and that their gene products form a complex in cultured cells and in the developing ureter. Two missense mutations in SIX 1 from BOR patients reduced or abolished SIX 1 -TBX 18 complex formation. These findings uncover an essential role for Six 1 in establishing a functionally normal ureter and provide new insights into the molecular basis of urinary tract malformations in BOR patients...|$|R
