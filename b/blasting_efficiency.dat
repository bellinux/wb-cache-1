40|$|Pumpable {{emulsion}} explosives {{have been}} available to surface and underground massive mining operations for decades and through their unique properties offer significant advantages through improved safety, reliability and performance. Despite their advantageous properties the benefits of pumpable emulsions have been unavailable to narrow reef mining operations due to the void in technology necessary for their successful implementation within the challenging environment. The purpose of the following research report is to evaluate the viability of pumpable emulsion explosives for use in South African narrow reef mining operations. By approaching the problem from multiple perspectives, this research report aimed first to propose a theoretical framework and suite of equipment suitable {{for the implementation of}} pumpable emulsions within the narrow reef environment. Through the development of this equipment, controlled tests could be undertaken on the proposed narrow reef emulsion formulations and pumpable emulsion technology to obtain the necessary understanding of the performance of the system under controlled conditions. Once an understanding had been obtained for the controlled performance of the system, a field study could be undertaken in order to compare the performance of the new pumpable emulsion system with available explosives within the underground mining industry. Through the results obtained a comparison could be made of the <b>blasting</b> <b>efficiency</b> and feasibility of pumpable emulsions when compared to existing explosives within the narrow reef environment. Given the vast difference in underground narrow reef and massive mining operations, fundamental changes were necessary with regard to emulsion technology prior to the successful implementation of the narrow reef emulsion system. Following the development of the system, controlled explosives tests allowed for optimisation of the pump technology as well as recommended daily practices. Blast results achieved in field trials with the narrow reef emulsion system allowed for improved <b>blasting</b> <b>efficiency</b> while reducing explosives costs per tonne broken. While blast results and efficiencies improved throughout pumpable emulsion trials, variances in daily blasting practices including the use of stemming, overcharging and varying priming practices influenced the results obtained.

30|$|For small–medium {{foundries}} (handling {{less than}} 2, 000  t per month of good casting), cold blast cupolas (which uses the blast at atmospheric pressure and at normal environmental temperature) are common. In {{order to reduce}} the CO emission and increase the energy efficiency, the conversion of cold blast furnaces to hot blast furnaces may be considered (this is economically justified only for bigger plants operating continuously). In hot blast cupolas, the combustion air (the “blast”) is preheated typically by a recuperative heat exchanger. This involves the transfer of the residual heat of the flue gases (that can be at 900 – 1, 000  °C) to the combustion air by means of post-combustion of exhausts (collected {{at the top of the}} furnace, mixed with sufficient air and then burned in a unit) and the following heat exchange in a recuperator. Typically, the blast air is heated at temperatures of 500 – 600  °C. Above these temperatures, problems arise with the sintering of furnace dust on the surface of the recuperator.

40|$|AbstractCleaning {{technology}} {{is an important}} factor in the field of production technology as well as service and recycling. Blasting with solid carbon dioxide (dry ice blasting – dib) is generally based on compressed air, which is a flexible but energy consuming acceleration method. To improve the mechanical acceleration by rotational wheel blasting, the main removal mechanisms of dib, mechanical and thermal, have been investigated separately. Based on the developed methods both mechanisms can be characterized independently of the target type. The presented results show a promising approach to determine the size of the mechanical removal mechanism's impact force. Obviously it depends primarily on the blasting pressure, one of the main influencing process factors. Cleaning applications – substrate and the adherence of the residues – show different resistance against thermal stress as well as against mechanical impact.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{an approach that}} improves the <b>blasting</b> <b>efficiency</b> in open pit mines. The aim {{of the study is}} the development of an environmentally friendly, low-emission production of dimension stone and gravel in six different quarries by optimizing the blasting technology. In addition to an improved energy-effective production of the muck pile two correlations of blast parameters were found. Both correlate the strain with the peak particle velocity: the first involves a “momentum-distance” relation and the second involves an “energy-distance ” relation. These relations suggest that the vibrations are controllable by adjusting the type of explosives, charge weights, borehole lengths, and borehole diameter. The simultaneous ignition of multiple charges according to the momentum theory does not increase the vibrations compared to consecutive ignition of smaller charges. This fact makes large blasting systems possible. The vibra-tion relations have to be determined individually for each quarry site. The zone of permanent deformation is defined on the basis of strain measurements at distances close to the blasting. Remarkably, damage in the form of crack formation does not occur in constructions outside of this zone, and this is independent of the construc-tion type. This is also valid for multiple blast impacts. parameters are calculated. If the forecast method is improved, the dimensioning of blasting systems is also improved...|$|E

We proposed a new technique to estimate the dynamic fracture process of the cylindrical rock specimen.

The strength of incident underwater shock wave is adjusted by changing the length of the water pipe. The main purpose of this test is to collect the experimental data on the behaviors of dynamic fracture of the rock. We would like to provide these experimental data, which can confirm the validities of the related numerical simulations or fracture models for the rock materials. In addition, one of the aims of this test is to estimate the dynamic tensile strength of the rock for a wide range of the strain rate utilizing Hopkinson’s effect. The free surface velocity at the end of rock specimen and the position of cracks on the rock surface are observed by using a laser vibration meter and high-speed camera, respectively.

40|$|Student Number : 0210528 - PhD thesis - School of Mining Engineering - Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmnetThis thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a directional primer charge for use in blasting in mining operations. The directional primer charge is an explosive gun which takes the place of a standard primer charge in a blasthole. It is a shaped charge which directs the explosive energy forwards into the blasthole. Its effectiveness is enhanced by a metal liner which is located at a specified stand-off distance from the toe of the hole. The explosive energy of the column charge is converted into the kinetic energy of the metal liner which transforms into an ultrasonic slug. This in turn converts into the impact energy of the slug impacting on the rock. This rock is axially compressed {{to such a degree that}} a radial fracture is developed. This radial fracture is termed an umbrella crack. Prior to the development of the directional primer charge, the phenomenon of the umbrella crack had only been observed in experimental Perspex blasting models and its formation mechanism had never been satisfactorily explained. If the directional primer charge could cause an umbrella crack in hard rock mining at the end of blastholes, then more rock would be broken out per blast than is currently achieved in practice. This thesis records the historical development of the explosive shaped charge with particular reference to the development of the explosively-forged projectile. It {{describes the}} classical theories and models which apply in determining the theoretical prediction of the physical properties of the designed directional primer charge. It describes the experimental procedures and measurements using flash X-ray radiography and electronic shorting screens to freeze the flight of a metal slug traveling at speeds of over 2000 metres per second. Underground tests were undertaken under full mining production conditions to compare the rock breaking effects of various designs. The theoretical calculation of the extent of the movement of the rock at the toe of the blasthole indicates that umbrella cracks should be formed. The underground tests confirm their formation. It is concluded that the use of the directional primer charge in stoping operations can improve the <b>blasting</b> <b>efficiency</b> in South African hard rock mines by up to 15...|$|E
40|$|The {{blasting}} operation plays {{a pivotal role}} in the overall economics of opencast mines. The blasting sub-system affects all the other associated sub-systems, i. e. loading, transport, crushing and milling operations. Fragmentation control through effective blast design and its effect on productivity are the challenging tasks for practicing blasting engineer due to inadequate knowledge of actual explosive energy released in the borehole, varying initiation practice in blast design and its effect on explosive energy release characteristic. This paper describes the result of a systematic study on the impact of blast design parameters on rock fragmentation at three mines in India. The mines use draglines and shovel–dumper combination for removal of overburden. Despite its pivotal role in controlling the overall economics of a mining operation, the expected blasting performance is often judged almost exclusively on the basis of poorly defined parameters such as powder factor and is often qualitative which results in very subjective assessment of blasting performance. Such an approach is very poor substitutes for accurate assessment of explosive and blasting performance.

It has been heretofore proposed to control the flight of such aircraft by fixed external vanes, or by vanes which are selectively moved into the slip stream of air surrounding the aircraft or into the rocket blast. Such vanes, if external, have serious air resistance which produces drag and reduces their steering effectiveness.

The role of blasting in mining A major part of South Africa's economy is based on the mining of the rich mineral deposits that {{are to be found in}} the country. These mining operations are carried out both above ground (open-pit iron ore mines, for example) and below ground (gold, uranium and others). Open-pit mining, in particular, requires significant amounts of commercial blasting to dislodge the high volumes of material that have to be moved and processed. An average blasting block at Iscor's Sishen mine, for example, contains about 250 000 tons of material, although a world record was established in April 1981 when 7, 2 million tons of rock was broken during a single blast. The chemical quality of the final products is partly controlled by supplying the primary crusher at the mine with a suitable mixture of so-called run-of-mine ore. To determine which material from a specific blasting block may be sent to the plant, and to which waste dump the remaining material should be assigned, factors such as beneficiation properties of the raw material and the content of various by-products are considered. Samples are typically taken from alternate blast holes for every metre drilled. Each drill sample is divided into two parts by means of a riffler for a washed and unwashed sample. The washed samples are examined and the rock types noted. Subsequently, all the samples are grouped and analysed chemically and the densities of the different rock types are determined. The results are processed and those for the washed and unwashed samples correlated. The blasting blocks in the pit are demarcated by means of whitewash lines, according to the divisions on the blasting-block plans, and they are marked with signs to guide shovel operators. Primary drilling is performed by means of electrically-driven rotary drills. At the Sishen mine, 310 mm diameter blast holes are drilled in all rock types. The following table depicts typical drilling 2 patterns for various rock types: Rock type Pattern (m) Drill depth (m) Hard iron ore 2 x 8, 3 3, 0 Medium-hard iron ore 1 x 9, 3 2, 7 Quartzite 8, 2 x 9, 4 2, 5 Flagstone 8, 2 x 9, 4 5 Calcrete 8, 1 x 9, 3 0 Primary blasting is done at Sishen with Heavy Anfo, an explosive that is manufactured by mine personnel at the emulsion plant on site. The ingredients for the explosive blends are transported by pump trucks to the blasting blocks, where it is mixed and pumped down the blast holes.

40|$|Abstract: Conventional {{comminution}} (crushing and grinding) uses {{compressive forces}} to initiate and propagate cracks throughout the rock mass, yet the material actually breaks under tension since this strength characteristic is about 10 {{percent of the}} compressive strength. Converting a compressive force into a tensile one is inefficient- {{of the order of}} 1 to 2 percent. On the other hand, <b>blasting</b> shows energy <b>efficiencies</b> of the order of 10 to 20 %. Part of this difference is due to forces being applied directly in tension (from the inside-out), but also because the velocity of impact is orders of magnitude higher (10, 000 m·s- 1 versus 10 m·s- 1), i. e., the rate of energy input is very high (micro-seconds vs. seconds in conventional comminution). This paper reports on studies that show how the energy efficiency of comminution can be enhanced by high-velocity impact.

40|$|Open pit mines {{constitute}} {{more than}} half of global minerals production. Yet most of the large, high-grade, and close to the surface deposits have been depleted or are currently in production. Besides, volatility in commodity prices and stringent environmental regulations limit the up-scaling expansions in large open pits. Consequently, the mines are determined to increase their operational efficiency in order to thrive. This has recently led to major metallurgical improvements in the processing of ores; whereas the improvements in mining of the said ores are relatively overdue in terms of efficiency and technological advancement. This thesis concentrates on the mining activities and their efficiency in open pits with a focus on drilling, blasting, loading, and crushing. As all of these tasks revolve around the fragmentation of run-of-mine ore, their relationships and efficiencies are explored within the context of fragmentation. Fragmentation is a result of complex interactions between rockmass, blasting geometry, explosive, and timing sequence of blast holes. The influence of rockmass and timing sequence on fragmentation and efficiency are explored, as well as the target fragmentation for efficient loading and crushing. Moreover, the techniques for measuring fragmentation are evaluated as to whether they can benefit mines in terms of efficiency. As the circumstances in open pits are essentially site-specific, these issues are addressed as a case study of the Aitik mine in Sweden. The research comprised four elements. First, the influence of rockmass fractures on blast results and downstream efficiency was evaluated via full-scale field trials. The fractures in and around the case study mine were mapped using a photogrammetric technique and six production blasts were adapted to the major fracture sets to evaluate the effect of initiation direction on downstream efficiency. Second, the influence of the timing sequence of blast holes was explored within the theories of stress waves interaction and their consequent effect on fragmentation. Theoretical and numerical solutions were accompanied by six field trials in full-scale to evaluate the influence of short delay times on fragmentation and efficiency. Third, an empirical study was conducted to correlate fragmentation to the efficiency of loading and crushing; this was done to define a target fragmentation for the studied case. Finally, the techniques to assess fragmentation were discussed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings indicated that rockmass fractures have a significant influence on the quality of <b>blasts</b> and <b>efficiency</b> of downstream tasks. In the case study mine, adjustments to orientation of drill pattern and initiation direction of blasts suggested that careful experimentation in this regard can yield a favourable initiation direction with respect to existing discontinuities. Finer fragmentation and higher loading efficiencies can be achieved by adapting the blast designs to the existing fractures, which can lead to significant savings in the long run. On the contrary, the influence of stress waves interaction on blast results turned out to be marginal. Neither the theoretical and numerical solutions nor the field trials showed any significant improvements in blast results from short delays. In fact, it was found rather implausible to expect any noticeable improvements by using short delays. The empirical method to evaluate target fragmentation proved useful as well. It was shown that by incorporating different data from various sources in a mine, one can follow the ore from muckpile to loaders and then to crushers. Having a qualitative understanding of the fragmentation, and by developing tools to measure efficiency, one can estimate what fragmentation is most favourable for an efficient operation. Finally, two image-based methods to assess fragmentation were discussed in terms of repeatability and statistical significance. It was found that the scatter in both methods is rather large, introducing a certain ambiguity in representativeness of their results. Admittedly, it was found that in matters of long-term efficiency, the number, size and representativeness of assessed samples are of more importance compared to the accuracy of individual measurements...|$|R

The effects of softening temperature, load pressure, and bed composition (mono - single melting particles, including pure or blend particles vs binary  two different melting point particles) on softening deformation are examined. The principal findings of this study are: 1. At low softening temperatures, an increase in load pressure increases the deformation rate almost linearly. 2. At higher softening temperatures, an increase in load pressure dramatically increases the deformation rate, and after a certain time there is no more significant change in deformation rate. 3. The bed deformation rate of a mono bed is much greater than that of a binary one. 4. In a binary system, the softening deformation rate increases almost proportionally with the increase in the amount of lower melting point wax balls. 5. In a mono system with blend particles, the content of the lower melting point material has a more significant effect on overall bed deformation than the higher melting point one. 6. The macro softening {{deformation of}} the bed behaves the theory of creep deformation. 7. A mathematical model for predicting bed porosity change due to softening deformation based on creep deformation theory has been developed. 8. Increase in load pressure also reduces the peak contact face number of the distribution curves, and this is more prominent with higher porosity values. 9. The contribution of contact face number to bed porosity reduction is more pronounced in a mono system than in a binary system. 10. The porosity reduction in a binary bed is more due to the contact face area increase, presumably of the lower melting point particles. 11. The mono system has a single peak contact face number distribution pattern while the binary system exhibits a bimodal distribution pattern once the higher melting point material starts to deform. 12. In a binary system, an increase in deformation condition severity tends to reduce the contact face number of the higher melting point material without having to increase the contact face number of the lower melting point material accordingly to achieve a given porosity...|$|R
40|$|The {{ironmaking}} {{process in}} blast furnace is complicated, and coupled with multiphase flow, chemical reaction and heat transfer, which make {{it one of}} the most complicated systems in industry. The process of ironmaking is very difficult to control but only few approaches are available, for example, improve the quality of the raw material, optimize burden distribution, and maximize coal combustion. The burden distribution significantly affects the <b>blast</b> furnace operation <b>efficiency.</b> The void fraction, gas flow distribution and burden descending behaviour depend on the burden distribution. Thus, understanding blast furnace burden distribution is very important for blast furnace operation. In most previous numerical studies, particle shape is not considered. Hence, in the first component, a discrete element method (DEM) based framework is established, aiming to bridge particle shape gap between simulation and practice. Spherical particle surface properties are adjusted by angle of repose to make spheres behave as non-spherical particles in practice. Then experimental results are used to validate DEM in the present study, showing a good agreement. Then variables related to burden distribution are investigated, such as particle surface properties, chute angles and discharge rate. Chute wear prediction has always been a problem for blast furnace schedule maintenance. In the second part, chute flow is analyzed in great details, and the microscopic information is generated to get better understanding of chute flow and thus used to predict the wear issue for rotating chute. Then size segregation phenomenon is also studied for both chute flow and in burden profiles. And finally, a practice case is simulated to further prove the capability of present DEM model, indicating DEM is capable to use for practice application. The purpose of taking control of burden distribution is taking control of the gas distribution in blast furnace thus can obtain smooth operation. In the third part, practice cases are simulated and analyzed. A thin sector frame is introduced to reduce total particle number in the system thus multi-layer burden profiles are studied, showing burden profile keeping changing in the charging process. Gas flow is simulated by coupling DEM with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and its distribution for different burden profiles are analyzed qualitatively. Hopper is the essential feeding mechanic for blast furnace, thus fundamental study is required in this area. In the fourth part, ellipsoidal particles are simulated in a rectangular hopper to study hopper flow phenomenon. The focus is particle shape effect on wall stress, meanwhile flow patterns and discharge rate have also been studied. The results indicate that particle shape changes the internal properties thus bulk material properties hence make impact on wall stress. The particles discharged from hopper can naturally form a pile, and the particle shape effect on angle of repose and force distributions are investigated. Furthermore, varies factors’ effects on stress dip phenomenon have been investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{blast furnace}} (BF) that {{converts}} iron ore into molten iron {{is an important}} component in iron-steel making. An improvement of the <b>blast</b> furnace fuel <b>efficiency</b> contributes to the reduction of energy consumption in the steel industry because this process represents about 70 % of the total energy input to this industry. The goal of the research is to improve the competitive edge of steel mills by developing the advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model to optimize the gas and burden distributions inside a blast furnace for achieving the best gas utilization. A state-of-the-art 3 -D CFD model has been developed for simulating the gas distribution inside a blast furnace at given burden conditions, burden distribution and blast parameters. The comprehensive 3 -D CFD model has been validated by plant measurement data from an actual blast furnace. Validations of the sub-models are also achieved. ^ The burden distribution is direct related to <b>efficiency</b> and stable <b>blast</b> furnace operation. In this research, a mathematical model for estimating the burden distribution was developed with the combination of the falling curve sub-model, stock-line profile formation sub-model and burden descending sub-model. In a blast furnace, the burden descending velocity may be non-uniform along the radial direction due to the shaft angle and non-uniform consumption. The modifications on two existing burden descending models, i. e., geometric profile (GP) model and potential flow (PF) model are proposed to consider the non-uniform descending speed. The proposed non-uniform descending models are validated with published scaled blast furnace model results. Comparing to the original uniform descending model, the accuracy increases notably for the modified models with the non-uniform descending velocity. ^ The blast furnace burden consists of alternative layers of iron ore and coke. A novel methodology is proposed to efficiently model the effects of alternative burden layer structure on gas flow, heat transfer, mass transfer and chemical reactions. Different reactions and heat transfer characteristics are applied for difference types of layer. ^ In addition, the layered CFD model accurately predicts the Cohesive Zone (CZ) shape where the melting of solid burden taking place. The shape and location of the CZ are determined by an iterative method based on the ore temperature distribution. A new methodology has been developed to determine the location and shape of the CZ, based on the burden temperature distribution and composition. In addition, an under-relaxation scheme has been developed to obtain layered CZ shape which explicitly considered the layer structure inside the CZ. ^ The user friendly software package named Blast Furnace Shaft Simulator (BFSS) has been developed to simulate the blast furnace shaft process. The BFSS software package has been used for the optimization of burden and gas distributions to maximize gas utilization with proper furnace permeability for given burden materials, productivities, and blast furnaces; and also to optimize the burden and gas distributions for high fuel injection rate and low coke rate. The research has significant benefits to the steel industry with high productivity, low energy consumption, and improved environment. Using the BFSS, it is possible to design, optimize, and trouble shoot the blast furnace operation. ...|$|R
