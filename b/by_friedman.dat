5|$|Following {{a disappointing}} 4–7–2 season the next year, Potteiger was {{replaced}} by LeRoy Andrews. Before the 1929 season, Mara purchased the entire squad of the Detroit Wolverines, including star quarterback Benny Friedman. The Wolverines had finished in third place the year before. Led <b>by</b> <b>Friedman,</b> New York's record soared to 13–1–1. However, their lone loss was a 20–6 setback in November to the Green Bay Packers, and by virtue of this win, and their 12–0–1 record, won the NFL title. Following the season, Mara transferred ownership over to his two sons to insulate the team from creditors. At the time, Jack was just 22, and Wellington only 14.|$|E
5|$|Marty Friedman {{filled the}} guitarist {{position}} at the recommendation of Ron Laffitte, a member of Capitol management. Laffitte had heard Dragon's Kiss, a solo recording <b>by</b> <b>Friedman</b> {{when he was in}} Cacophony. Mustaine and Ellefson were satisfied with Friedman's style and thought he understood Megadeth's music. With Friedman in the group, the band completed what fans consider the definitive Megadeth lineup. The revitalized band entered Rumbo Studios in March 1990 with co-producer Mike Clink to begin Megadeth's most critically acclaimed album to date, Rust in Peace. For the first time the band's members remained sober in the studio, alleviating many problems which plagued previous albums. Clink was the first producer to complete a Megadeth album without being fired. Its recording was documented in Rusted Pieces, a home video released in 1991 with six music videos and an interview with the band.|$|E

500|$|At that time, Arthur F. Burns, who {{was then}} the head of the National Bureau of Economic Research, asked Friedman to rejoin the Bureau's staff. He {{accepted}} the invitation, and assumed responsibility for the Bureau's inquiry into the role of money in the business cycle. As a result, he initiated the [...] "Workshop in Money and Banking" [...] (the [...] "Chicago Workshop"), which promoted a revival of monetary studies. During {{the latter half of the}} 1940s, Friedman began a collaboration with Anna Schwartz, an economic historian at the Bureau, that would ultimately result in the 1963 publication of a book co-authored <b>by</b> <b>Friedman</b> and Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960.|$|E

With George Stigler and others, Friedman was among the intellectual leaders of the second generation of Chicago price theory, a methodological movement at the University of Chicago's Department of Economics, Law School, and Graduate School of Business from the 1940s onward.

500|$|Following Metallica's {{mainstream}} {{breakthrough in}} 1991, Mustaine stripped down Megadeth's sound, though the music remained as technically perfectionist as their previous releases. Drummer Nick Menza explained: [...] "Metallica has definitely {{opened the doors}} for other bands to step through. We're obviously the next band to step through that doorway." [...] Musically, Countdown to Extinction saw Megadeth beginning to incorporate more melody and mid-tempos into its traditional sound. Bassist David Ellefson noted that the band's goal was to [...] "create music that had more of a groove to it," [...] capitalizing on the melodic playing style employed <b>by</b> <b>Friedman,</b> and further assisted by the input of producer Norman. Author Thomas Harrison wrote that with this album, Megadeth's music became [...] "more virtuosic than noisy and took {{the next step towards}} widespread acceptance".|$|E
500|$|Econometrician David Hendry criticized part of Friedman's and Anna Schwartz's 1982 Monetary Trends. When {{asked about}} it during an {{interview}} with Icelandic TV in 1984, Friedman said that the criticism referred to a different problem from that which he and Schwartz had tackled, and hence was irrelevant, and pointed out the lack of consequential peer review amongst econometricians on Hendry's work. In 2006, Hendry said that Friedman was guilty of [...] "serious errors" [...] of misunderstanding that meant [...] "the t-ratios he reported for UK money demand were overstated by nearly 100 per cent", and said that, in a paper published in 1991 with Neil Ericsson, he had refuted [...] "almost every empirical claim [...] made about UK money demand" [...] <b>by</b> <b>Friedman</b> and Schwartz.

Benny Friedman tried to scoop up the ball, but he fumbled it and Northwestern recovered on Michigan's three-yard line. [...] Michigan's defense held on three straight runs by Northwestern.

500|$|The Phillips curve {{appeared}} {{to reflect a}} clear, inverse relationship between inflation and output. The curve broke down in the 1970s as economies suffered simultaneous economic stagnation and inflation known as stagflation. The empirical implosion of the Phillips curve followed attacks mounted on theoretical grounds <b>by</b> <b>Friedman</b> and Edmund Phelps. Phelps, although not a monetarist, argued that only unexpected inflation or deflation impacted employment. Variations of Phelps's [...] "expectations-augmented Phillips curve" [...] became standard tools. Friedman and Phelps used models with no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Instead of the Phillips curve they used models based on the natural rate of unemployment where expansionary monetary policy can only temporarily shift unemployment below the natural rate. Eventually, firms will adjust their prices and wages for inflation based on real factors, ignoring nominal changes from monetary policy. The expansionary boost will be wiped out.|$|E
500|$|The anime {{series has}} been {{compared}} with a similar series that involved gender swapping—Rumiko Takahashi's Ranma ½. In a review at T.H.E.M.

The characters, as they are, bring much of the believability of the show, despite the alien elements. It's very much down to earth and pleasant to look at, if nothing else. The rather soft and detailed art style does help, of course, as does the generally great animation quality." [...] The conclusion of the anime was positively reviewed by Erica Friedman, who is the president of Yuricon, an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the anime's conclusion as [...] "so normal - so much like a thing that might have actually happened in real life...that it kind of just went under the radar. So - after all these years of watching crappy unresolved restart endings we FINALLY get a real ending and it's a yuri ending where the girl remains a girl and get the girl and...thud. Nothing." [...] The anime was given an overall score of 7/10 <b>by</b> <b>Friedman.</b>|$|E

500|$|Friedman {{also argued}} for the {{cessation}} of government intervention in currency markets, thereby spawning an enormous literature on the subject, as well as promoting the practice of freely floating exchange rates. His close friend George Stigler explained, [...] "As is customary in science, he did not win a full victory, in part because research was directed along different lines by the theory of rational expectations, a newer approach developed by Robert Lucas, also at the University of Chicago." [...] The relationship between Friedman and Lucas, or new classical macroeconomics as a whole, was highly complex. The Friedmanian Phillips curve was an interesting starting point for Lucas, but he soon realized that the solution provided <b>by</b> <b>Friedman</b> was not quite satisfactory. Lucas elaborated a new approach in which rational expectations were presumed instead of the Friedmanian adaptive expectations. Due to this reformulation, the story in which {{the theory of the}} new classical Phillips curve was embedded radically changed. This modification, however, had a significant effect on Friedman’s own approach, so, as a result, the theory of the Friedmanian Phillips curve also changed. Moreover, new classical Neil Wallace, who was {{a graduate student at the}} University of Chicago between 1960 and 1963, regarded Friedman’s theoretical courses as a mess. This evaluation clearly indicates the broken relationship between Friedmanian monetarism and new classical macroeconomics.|$|E

2500|$|More {{influential}} was the Chicago {{school of}} economics, led by Milton Friedman (1912–2006) and George J. Stigler (1911–1991), who advocated neoclassical and monetarist public policy. The Chicago School provided a vigorous criticism of regulation, {{on the grounds}} that it led to control of the regulations by the regulated industries themselves. Since 1974, government regulation of industry and banking has greatly decreased. The School attacked Keynesian economics, then the dominant theory of economics, which Friedman claimed was based on unsound models. The [...] "stagflation" [...] of the 1970s (combining high inflation and high unemployment) was impossible according to Keynesian models, but was predicted <b>by</b> <b>Friedman,</b> giving his approach credibility among the experts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, the Japanese {{introduced}} a new cipher machine for their most sensitive diplomatic traffic, replacing an earlier system that SIS referred to as [...] "RED." [...] The new cipher, which SIS called [...] "PURPLE", was different and much more difficult. The Navy's cryptological unit (OP-20-G) and the SIS {{thought it might be}} related to earlier Japanese cipher machines, and agreed that SIS would handle the attack on the system. After several months trying to discover underlying patterns in PURPLE ciphertexts, an SIS team led <b>by</b> <b>Friedman</b> and Rowlett, in an extraordinary achievement, figured it out. PURPLE, unlike the German Enigma or the Hebern design, did not use rotors but stepper switches like those in automated telephone exchanges. Leo Rosen of SIS built a machine — as was later discovered, using the identical model of switch that the Japanese designer had chosen.|$|E
2500|$|Cognitive {{inhibition}} {{can be seen}} at {{work during}} studies in developmental psychology. [...] An experiment done <b>by</b> <b>Friedman</b> and Leslie explained children's performance in the false belief task as relying on a critical inhibitory process. What this demonstrated is that reaching the age of 3 or 4 triggers cognitive inhibition ability formation. The idea is that children who are 3 or 4 can suppress information from their cognitive experience in order to evaluate a situation from another's point of view. This is very important developmentally as it may interact with the formation of empathy: cognitive inhibition cannot be so great as to completely block one's experiences while evaluating another point of view, but must be strong enough to enable an accurate representation of that point of view. Other elements of cognitive inhibition that are studied in developmental psychology include memory formation [...] or memory inhibition. It has been demonstrated that intentional inhibition of memory commitment is not fully developed until adulthood, and is very difficult for children to accomplish. This illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition tasks, such as those in memory processing, are a gradually acquired skill rather than instinctual. Other cognitive functions that are developed gradually throughout childhood include exercising self-control over retained representational structures of information and quickly adapting cognitive processing to changing behavioral situations. Both of these functions were determined to be present throughout development, but not at full capacity until young adulthood. Evidently, the ability to intentionally ignore irrelevant details and to focus attention and cognitive ability on more relevant details is not present in young children and is a highly developmentally-related process.|$|E
