Last week, the CM Specialist Group of British Computer Society (BCS CMSG) hosted a special event on Agile-versus-Traditional Configuration Management [1]. Presenters discussed the impact of agile methods to traditional SCM and posed the question: Is there a need for Agile CM- and what is it? This month, we describe what we believe are {{the root causes of}} some key differences between agile and traditional development, and how they change certain assumptions SCM has about software development. Should I be worried about Agile Development? Agile development practices can significantly impact software development practices. Of course, any significant process change is ultimately a change in the organization’s culture. And underlying any cultural change is a set of values and beliefs that define and sustain the change in behaviors and mindsets. How will such changes affect us as SCM professionals? • Should SCM professionals be worried about agile projects running out of control? • Should agile teams be worried about SCM cramping their style and entangling them in red tape...|$|E

If for some reason the letter did not reach you, I would like to express my thanks again now and also let you know that you have the correct address.

There is one break we get here in Florida though, and that is we can go bathing and lay on the beach wile you are wrapped up in heavy winter clothing to keep warm. The ocean temperature averages around 70 or 75 degrees in the winter and it sure feels good. Even this simmer we are getting the breaks. So far the hottest day we have had has been 86 and I’ve seen by the Providence Papers that you have had much warmer days even though you can look forward to a cool day now and then.

The cattle and the horses have thick, shaggy coats and for the last two weeks they have had a tough time finding anything to eat because of all the snow. Of course I have had to do more driving around the country the last two months than ever before and none of the trucks have cabs. You might think it would build a fellow up but it doesn’t. Just wears him out. And to think I went to Bryant so I could get a soft job, inside, and wouldn’t have to be tough at all. But I can’t kick. I’m still in a good country.

You see around the first of August, I left the states for overseas duty and after some 2 ½ months I finally arrived at my destination, some where in India. The land of enchantment and untold mysteries, with its mystic beauties, sets a throb in any travelers heart. All of the boys over here have found India an unforeseen paradise. India at dawn, India at dusk never loses its magnificence as the sun slowly rises or sets in the sky over this picturesque land. When I did get here I had a bundle of mail 1 foot high. Your letter was on top, although I {{did not know it}} was yours. It was put in a war tmpt. envelope because it had so many different addresses on it. It followed me from Ft. Harrison, Ind. to Homestead, Fla, then to Miami, then up to New York, where it was sent overseas. It was wonderful news hearing about those Bryant fellows who were found after reported missing. We all hope and pray that many more of our boys missing in action will be found. Thanks a log for the list of fellow’s addresses. I often wondered where they all went too. Things in India arn’t [sic] so bad though. We get all the cigarettes and tobacco we need, we usually get a ration of American beer each week, besides, gum, candy, toilet articles, and magazines. We’ve seen several U. S. O. shows direct from the States, including Jack Benny and his cast. Every so often we see an all G. I. show, which really are good. We have several short wave radios and we get broadcasts from the United States, England, Italy, South America, and dear old Japan, (all propaganda). In closing I would like to say {{to the members of the}} B. S. C. that you have my heartiest congratulations on the work you are doing for the fellows in the Armed Forces.

40|$|Well, here we {{are with}} another full volume published. I have watched this journal grow from an idea to a sustainable, reputable journal with readers and {{contributors}} {{from all over the}} world. It has grown from a small editorial group to a collection of peer reviewers, Evidence Summary writers, copyeditors, etc., that is eighty-four strong (and counting). I have wavered between wondering whether promoting evidence based librarianship is akin to flogging a dead horse to feeling secure in knowing that we are making a difference. Being involved with this journal has made me look at what I do in a different light and I now approach decisions and change with what I refer to as “structured flexibility”. Following the EBL framework is the structured part, and when it works, it works well. But we all know that there is not always an answer in the literature nor is there a guarantee that implemented evidence based change will work similarly in different environments. That’s where the flexibility comes in. Three years as Editor-in-Chief has been a challenging, enjoyable, time-consuming, and fascinating learning experience. It has provided me with numerous opportunities in terms of speaking engagements, workshop offerings, and valuable discussion and discourse. It has also provided me with research and project ideas that I have had to place on the back burner until a time when I have enough hours in the day. Recognizing that adding additional hours to the day is, well, impossible, I have decided to stepdown from my editorial role to pursue other activities. This was a bittersweet decision, but a necessary one. I am pleased to announce that Denise Koufogiannakis will be taking on the role of Editor-in-Chief for the next term. Denise, as many of you know, has also been involved with this journal since its inception and, after a brief period of reduced involvement, has eagerly stepped up to the plate. This journal would not be what it is today without Denise’s continued dedication and passion. You’re in good hands. I look forward to watching this journal continue to grow and to contributing to it as a peer reviewer. Thank you to the entire editorial team for providing me with three years of collaborative teamwork and a mostmemorable, meaningful professional experience. I am grateful for all your valuable time, effort, and expertise. <b>Best</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> all, and I’ll see you at EBLIP 5.

I have had some wonderful experiences and have learned things that I would not have learned had I not traveled to far off lands. I hope it won’t be long until all the boys can return home and start life anew in a new and peaceful country. There is not much a fellow can write about here and therefore I hope you will excuse the short letter. I have been meaning to write you before but there is work to be done first and write letters afterwards. I hope I will hear from you again soon and would like some information on the boys of the class of ’ 36. I know that quite a few of them are in the Army but I could not say as to their whereabouts at present. I would appreciate your sending me any information you could gather about my school chums. Well so long for now and the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in what you are doing for the boys in the service. Write again soon and please send me the Bulletin. I will write again when I get the chance. Best of luck to all. Sincerely yours, Gardiner W. Congdon, Class of ’ 36. [Transcription ends...|$|E

Feb. 7, 1943 Fellow Students, I {{received}} {{your very}} nice letter {{and also the}} enclosed copy of the November issue of the Bryant Alumni Bulletin. I was very pleased {{to hear from you}} and {{want to tell you that}} I think your idea of keeping in touch with former members of Bryant who are now in the service of their country an admirable one. It is a long time since I have been at Bryant but I have nothing but fond memories and a good education that has been to my advantage on more than one occasion. I could not help but smile when I read your reference to change of address. I’ll say I’ve had a change of address since I last heard from you. I would like to tell you in detail of the many experiences and adventures that I have had in the past few months but I know that you realize that censorship will not permit me to do so. However, I am at liberty to tell you a little so here goes. At the present time I am located on an island in the Southwest Pacific. This island is very mountainous and French is the language that is spoken. The Franc is the basis of the monetary system and the climate is definitely on the hot side. We have two kinds of seasons here one is the rainy season and the other is the season when it doesn’t rain quite so much. There are two things that we can always depend on and that is that it will be hot and that there will always be a liberal supply of mosquitoes and other insects. The mosquitoes seem to take particular delight in biting my tender flesh and I’m sure that the other members of this command are subject to the same nuisance. There is no entertainment except that which we provide ourselves. However there is one exception and that is the movies. The pictures are generally old and I have seen most of them on previous occasions but I see them again as it helps pass the time. I found many items in the Alumni Bulletin that were of interest to me especially the reference to Eleanor Eldridge who was kind enough to write to me as a result of your program of writing to men in the service. She has written me many interesting letters which I have enjoyed very much and now that she has joined the W. A. V. E. S. we have something in common. I am sure that she will be a success and a credit to our country. I don’t imagine that there are many now at Bryant who remember me but I want <b>to</b> wish the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> all <b>of</b> you and please remember me to Gardner Jacobs and to Mr. Lee and Mr. Gulski. I particularly want to thank the person whose initials are N. M. W. and who was kind enough to write your nice letter out in long hand. Please write again as I enjoy hearing from you and hope that some day when the war is ended I may have the pleasure of once again coming to Bryant and meeting some of you personally. Thanks, Louis M. Schablein, Jr. [Transcription ends...|$|R
40|$|This issue {{brings to}} {{completion}} another year and another volume. It also represents my last issue as Editor of Mathematical Mayhem. I {{have been at}} this post {{for a long time}} now, and in that time, I have seen Mayhem go through several changes, most notably the merger with Crux Mathematicorum, but its spirit and purpose has remained the same. At this point, I would like to thank all the current members of the Mayhem sta: Cyrus Hsia, Adrian Chan, Donny Cheung, Jimmy Chui, and David Savitt, as well as all the other sta memberswhoareno longer present. Your hard work and dedication over the years have been greatly appreciated. I {{would also like to thank}} Bruce Shawyer, who has had to put up with his share of garbled L ATEX and missed deadlines, for his patience and guidance, and in addition the CMS, without whom Mayhem would not be where itis today. Most of all, however, I would like to thank all the people who have read and contributed to Mayhem. We greatly value your input and support, and you are the reason that Mayhem exists. Taking over from me next year will be Shawn Godin, a high school math and physicsteacher in Ottawa. His enthusiasm and vision will be a welcome addition to Mayhem, and I wish him the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck.</b> Thanks again <b>to</b> all. Ionce said I believed that Mayhem was a good thing. I still do...|$|R
