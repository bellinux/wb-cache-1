5|$|A typical Nike-X {{deployment}} {{around a}} major city would have consisted of several missile batteries. One of these would <b>be</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> the MAR and its associated DCDP computers, while the others would optionally have an MSR. The sites were all networked together using communications equipment working at normal voice bandwidths. Some of the smaller bases would be built north of the MAR to provide protection to this central station.|$|E
5|$|Abilities are {{classified}} into action and support categories. Action abilities consume magic points (MP) and include magic spells and special moves {{that are used}} in battle. Support abilities provide functions that remain in effect indefinitely and must <b>be</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> magic stones to be functional.

5|$|Dreadnoughts {{also carried}} lighter weapons. Many early dreadnoughts carried a {{secondary}} armament of very light guns designed {{to fend off}} enemy torpedo boats. The calibre and weight of secondary armament tended to increase, as the range of torpedoes and the staying power of the destroyers expected to carry them also increased. From the end of World War I onwards, battleships had to <b>be</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> many light guns as anti-aircraft armament.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the 100th {{became the}} first Army Reserve {{formation}} to <b>be</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> its own squadrons of M1 Abrams tanks.

5|$|SM U-21 was a U-boat {{built for}} the Imperial German Navy shortly before World War I. The third of four Type U-19-class submarines, these were the first U-boats in German service to <b>be</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> diesel engines. U-21 was built between 1910 and October 1913 at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig. She was armed with four torpedo tubes and a single deck gun, though a second was added during her career.|$|E
5|$|The 767 {{interior}} introduced larger overhead bins {{and more}} lavatories per passenger than previous aircraft. The bins are wider to accommodate garment bags without folding, and strengthened for heavier carry-on items. A single, large galley is installed near the aft doors, allowing for more efficient meal service and simpler ground resupply. Passenger and service doors are an overhead plug type, which retract upwards, and commonly used doors can <b>be</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> an electric-assist system.|$|E
5|$|The CSBS and the {{improved}} version, the Mk. X were insufficient, as both were {{too large to}} easily stabilize. Because {{of the way it}} was built, the Automatic Bomb Sight could <b>be</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> a stabilizer but it was estimated that it would be some time before it could be modified and brought into production. The Norden did offer stabilization but it also required relatively long setup times and was still not available for purchase.|$|E

5|$|The Yakovlev Yak-19 (Russian: Як-19, USAF/DOD {{designation}} Type 7) was {{a prototype}} Soviet fighter built in late 1940s.

5|$|The vessels {{also carried}} the same {{electrical}} plant {{as in the}} older Roon-class ships. It consisted of four turbo-generators that delivered 260kilowatts at 110volts. The Scharnhorst-class ships were the last cruisers built by Germany to <b>be</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> generators that put out power at 110volts; the subsequent design, , had generators that ran at 225volts.|$|E
5|$|To {{capture the}} straight-on {{shot of the}} shower head, the camera had to <b>be</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> a long lens.

5|$|Aerial robots must be {{unmanned}} and autonomous, {{and must}} compete {{based on their}} ability to sense the semi-structured environment of the competition arena. They may be intelligent or preprogrammed, but they must not be controlled by a remote human operator. Computational power need not be carried on the air vehicle itself. Computers operating from standard commercial power may be set up outside the competition arena boundary and uni- or bi-directional data may be transmitted to/from the vehicles in the arena. Size or weight constraints are normally placed on the aerial robots, which must <b>be</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> a method of manually activated remote override of the primary propulsion system.|$|E
5|$|As intended, the Comanche was to <b>be</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> {{sophisticated}} avionics, including {{navigation and}} detection systems, {{which would have}} to enabled operations during nighttime and within challenging weather conditions. Its primary mission was to scout around using its advanced sensors, attempting to find and designate targets for attack helicopters, such as the AH-64 Apache, to strike. The Comanche was furnished with a digital fly-by-wire flight control system. Each of the two crew members were to be provided {{with a pair of}} LCD multi-functional displays which would have functioned in addition to the Helmet-Integrated Display and Sight System (HIDSS) worn by the crew.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} work {{had already begun}} on MAR-II on Kwajalein; built by General Electric, it {{differed}} in form and in its beam steering system. The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land {{just west of the}} original Zeus site. MAR-II was built into a pyramid with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would <b>be</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> only one set of transmitter and receiver elements, but with all the wiring in place in case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a climate-controlled storage facility.|$|E
