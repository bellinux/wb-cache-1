40|$|The {{polyphagous}} shot <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> and Kuroshio shot <b>hole</b> <b>borer,</b> {{two members}} of the Euwallacea fornicatus species complex (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), are invasive ambrosia beetles that harbor distinct species of Fusarium fungal symbionts. Together with the damage caused by gallery construction, these two phytopathogenic Fusarium species are responsible for the emerging tree disease Fusarium dieback, which affects over 50 common tree species in Southern California. Host trees suffer branch dieback as the xylem is blocked by invading beetles and fungi, forcing the costly removal of dead and dying trees in urban areas. The beetles are also threatening natural riparian habitats, and avocado is susceptible to Fusarium dieback as well, resulting in damage to the avocado industries in California and Israel. Currently there are no adequate control mechanisms for shot <b>hole</b> <b>borers.</b> This paper summarizes efforts to find a suitable lure to monitor shot <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> invasions and dispersal. Field trials were conducted in two counties in Southern California over a span of two years. We find that the chemical quercivorol is highly attractive to these beetles, and perform subsequent field experiments attempting to optimize this lure. We also explore other methods of increasing trap catch and effects of other potential attractants, as well as the deterrents verbenone and piperitone...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent {{eruption}} of a pernicious insect known as the shot <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> (Euwallacea fornicatus). This pest is {{a major threat to}} the agricultural stability in Southern California. A plant pathogenic fungus is vectored by the borer. The fungus, Fusarium sp., clogs the tree's vascular system, causing dieback in the outer branches. Avocados (Persea americana), one of California's premium crops, are threatened by the shot <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> and associated fungus. The tree itself is not likely to survive the infestation. Other known hosts of the insect include Castor Bean (Ricinus communis), American Sweet Gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), California Sycamore (Plantanus racemosa), and Coast Live Oak (Quercus agrifolia); all of which are part of the campus flora and therefore, possible hosts. Our campus serves as a "living laboratory" for pests and disease issues that affect agriculture in Southern California. Being a major agricultural university, Cal Poly Pomona has several plots of trees prone to attack from the shot <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> and its affiliated fungus. In order to discover the range and severity of potential infected plants, a campus survey needed to be conducted.

40|$|Three cryptic {{species in}} the Euwallacea fornicatus species complex were reared in {{laboratory}} colonies and investigated {{for the presence of}} pheromones. Collections of volatiles from combinations of diet, fungus, beetles, and galleries from polyphagous shot <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> (Euwallacea sp. # 1) revealed the presence of 2 -heneicosanone and 2 -tricosanone only in the presence of beetles, regardless of sex. Subsequent examination of volatiles from the other two species, tea shot <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> (Euwallacea sp. # 2) and Kuroshio shot <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> (Euwallacea sp. # 5), revealed these two ketones were present in all three species but in different ratios. In dual choice olfactometer behavioral bioassays, mature mated females were strongly attracted to a synthetic binary blend of ketones matching their own natural ratios. However, females in each species were repelled by ketone blends in ratios corresponding to the other two species. Males of each species responded similarly to females when presented with ratios matching their own or the other two species. The presence of these compounds in the three beetle species, in ratios unique to each species, and their strong species-specific attraction and repellency, suggests they are pheromones. The ecological function of these pheromones is discussed. In addition to the pheromones, the previously known attractant (1 S, 4 R) -p-menth- 2 -en- 1 -ol (also known as quercivorol) was discovered {{in the presence of the}} fungal symbionts, but not in association with the beetles. Quercivorol was tested in a dual-choice olfactometer and was strongly attractive to all three species.

40|$|The spotted stem borer, Chilo partellus, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests of sorghum, and host plant resistance is an important component for the management of this pest. Most of the sorghum hybrids currently under cultivation are based on cytoplasmic male-sterility (CMS). In order to develop a strategy for resistance to stem borer, we studied the traits associated with resistance, and their nature of gene action in F 1 hybrids derived from resistant, moderately resistant, and susceptible CMS and restorer lines. The hybrids based on stem borer-resistant, moderately resistant, or susceptible CMS and restorer lines were equally resistant or susceptible as the parents for leaf feeding [Damage rating (DR) 5. 8 to 6. 6 vs. 5. 9 to 6. 6], and had significant and decreasing trend in deadheart formation (resistant CMS × resistant restorer lines < moderately resistant CMS × moderately resistant restorer lines < susceptible CMS × susceptible restorer lines), respectively. Proportional contributions of restorer lines were greater than those of the CMS lines for leaf feeding, deadhearts, recovery and overall resistance, stalk length, nodes per plant, stem <b>borer</b> <b>holes</b> per plant, and peduncle tunneling. The general (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) estimates suggested that leaf feeding score, number of nodes, overall resistance score, panicle initiation, recovery score, and stalk length (dominance type of gene action) have been found to be associated with resistance to spotted stem borer, governed by additive type of gene action, their correlation and direct effects in the same direction, and explained 65. 3 % of the variation in deadhearts, and thus could be used as marker traits to select and breed for resistance to C. partellus in sorghum.

The results of this study suggest that the KSHB-associated F. kuroshium and G. kuroshium are novel fungal associates of KSHB. A method to inhibit the Fusarium ambrosial fungi of PSHB and KSHB using plant-endophytic bacteria was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Endophytic bacterial isolates were obtained from the wood tissues of avocado (Persea americana) and California sycamore (Platanus racemosa), and were identified using molecular identification methods. These bacteria were simultaneously cultured with F. euwallaceae in order to screen for endophytic bacteria with the ability to inhibit the Fusarium ambrosial fungi. 15 bacterial isolates were found to inhibit F. euwallaceae during the screen. Inhibition efficacies of the bacterial endophytes were calculated for both Fusarium associates of PSHB and KSHB as percent inhibition, and 4 Bacterial isolates that showed the highest percent inhibition were chosen to be used as injection treatments in the greenhouse in vivo study. In greenhouse, stems of avocado and California sycamore were bacterized using the endophytic bacteria then challenged with F. euwallaceae or F. kuroshium.

The cork borer was made from a hypodermic injection needle (14 #) with the tip removed and modified (Hammel 1968). The borer can bring bark debris out when it removes out to {{lower the risk of}} system blockage without damaging the xylem. Following the withdrawing of the borer, the micropipette tip of the PTPP was immediately inserted tightly into the hole. The latex will flow out rapidly from many severed laticifers into the PTPP system and pressurize the silicon oil inside it. The pressure inside the PTPP was recorded with a pressure transducer (26 PCFA 6 D, Honeywell, Germany) and a data logger (92101 Sensor-interface, Burster, Germany) to monitor the pressure change. During the measurement, the pressure inside the system can be changed while the latex exudation from the wounded laticifers was slowed, stopped or reversed by adjusting the micrometer screw {{at the end of the}} probe. The reliability of the measured {{turgor pressure}} could also be confirmed by a relaxation (suction) drop and a subsequently quick recovery of the pressure by adjusting the micrometer screw because the H. brasiliensis laticifer is a big reservoir of latex.|$|R

The ambrosia beetle carries several symbiotic fungi, including Fusarium euwallaceae which was newly identified as a species associated with recent tree dieback symptoms. Injury occurs when the ambrosia beetle bores into a tree to create tunnels (galleries) for its eggs and larvae and, in the process, inoculates the tunnels with its symbiotic fungi that subsequently clog the surrounding water conducting tissue, or xylem. These pests in combination have killed several hardwood species in urban areas and on National Forest lands. This ambrosia beetle attacks over 20 species as hosts, including bigleaf maple, Acer macrophyllum, California box elder, Acer negundo var. californicum, California sycamore, Platanus racemosa, coast live oak, Quercus agrifolia, castorbean, Ricinus communis, red willow, Salix laevigata, valley oak, Q. lobata, and white alder, Alnus rhombifolia, {{all of which are}} found on public land.

Collectively termed E. nr. fornicatus, these cryptic species carry symbiotic Fusarium spp. fungi, some of which cause dieback disease in susceptible hosts, which include avocado, Persea americana Miller. Due to the threat to this economically important crop, research was initiated to evaluate efficacy of kairomone-based lures for detection of the beetle in Florida (termed the Florida tea shot <b>hole</b> <b>borer,</b> FL-TSHB). A series of field tests were conducted in 2016 in commercial avocado groves known to have FL-TSHB at various population levels. All tests evaluated lures containing quercivorol (p-menth- 2 -en- 1 -ol) and α-copaene, presented separately and in combination; and one test evaluated effect of trap type on beetle captures. In addition, electroantennography (EAG) was used to quantify female olfactory responses to lure emissions. This study identified (-) -α-copaene as a new attractant for FL-TSHB, equivalent in efficacy to quercivorol (the standard lure for Euwallacea detection in the USA); however, the combination of lures captured significantly more FL-TSHB than either lure alone. This combination resulted in synergistic attraction at two field sites and additive attraction at a third site. Sticky panel traps captured more FL-TSHB than comparably-baited Lindgren funnel traps.

50|$|Tree injection, {{also known}} as trunk or stem injection, is a method of target precise {{application}} of pesticides, plant resistance activators, and fertilizers into the xylem vascular tissue of a tree {{with the purpose of}} protecting the tree from pests or nutrition for correction of nutrient deficiencies. This method largely relies on harnessing the tree’s vascular system to translocate and distribute the active compounds into the wood, canopy and roots where protection or nutrition is needed. Tree injection is currently the most popular method for control of damaging insects, pathogens, and nematodes in landscape tree care. It has been developed primarily for use on large size trees and in proximity of urban areas where ground- and air-spray applications are impractical due to substantial drift-driven pesticide losses or not allowed due to potential human exposure. However, the prime driver of tree injection use has been a wide spread need for control of many invasive tree pathogens and insects pests. The most infamous examples are that of Ophiostoma fungi that cause Dutch Elm Disease (DED) and insect Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) which have specific biologies that lead to severe internal damage of wood and thus tree death, and which make their management extremely difficult or inefficient with classical pesticide application methods. Trunk injection for tree protection is viewed as environmentally safer alternative for pesticide application since the compound is delivered within the tree, thus allowing for selective exposure to plant pests. In landscapes and urban zones trunk injection significantly reduces the non-target exposure of water, soil, air, and wildlife to pesticides and fertilizers. In the last 20 years, tree injection is gaining momentum with the development and availability of new, efficient injection devices and injectable and xylem mobile formulations of pesticides, biopesticides and nutrients. Further, a number of newly occurring and fast spreading invasive insect pests and diseases such as Polyphagous Shot <b>Hole</b> <b>Borer</b> (PSHB) Euwallacea, which vectors plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium euwallaceae, and Sudden Oak Death (SOD) caused by an Oomycete Phytophthora ramorum, establish the use of trunk injection as the most efficient tree protection technique in landscapes and urban forestry.|$|R

In the 22 forested units,I examined the dominant arroyo and black willows (Salix lasiolepis Benth. and S. gooddingii C. R. Ball), and in the seven scrub units, I examined mule fat (Baccharis salicifolia (Ruiz & Pav.) Pers.). Evidence of KSHB infestation was found in 25 of the 29 units. In the forest units, infestation rates ranged from 0 to 100 % and were high (> 60 %) in 16 of the units. In the scrub units, infestation rates ranged from 0 to 33 %. Infestation rates were significantly correlated with the wetness of a unit; wetter units had higher infestation rates. Evidence of major physical damage was found in 24 units, and dense stands of willows were reduced to broken trunks in several areas. Overall, I estimated that more than 280, 000 (70 %) of the willows in the valley were infested, and more than 140, 000 had suffered major limb damage. In addition, I recorded evidence of KSHB infestation in the other common plant species in the valley; of the 23 species examined, 14 showed evidence of beetle attack. The four species with the highest rates of infestation were native trees in the Salicaceae family. The three species considered to be the worst invasive plants in the valley, Ricinus communis L., Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. and Arundo donax L., had low rates of infestation. Several findings from this study have significance for resource managers: (1) the KSHB attack caused extensive mortality of trees soon after being first discovered so, if managers are to control the spread of the beetle, they will need to develop an effective early detection and rapid response program; (2) infestation rates were highest in units that were wet, so resource managers trying to detect the beetle in other areas should thoroughly search trees near water, particularly nutrient-enriched water; (3) the infestation appears to be a novel form of disturbance, and the affected forests may need special management actions in order to recover; and (4) the infestation has altered the structure of the forest canopy, and this is likely to promote the growth of invasive plant species that were relatively inconspicuous in the forests prior to the beetle attack but will now need more attention...|$|R
