5000|$|... #Caption: An 'iron-hydrogen resistor', or <b>barretter</b> -- a {{glass bulb}} {{containing}} an iron filament in a hydrogen atmosphere that forms a temperature-dependent iron-hydrogen alloy during operation.|$|E
5000|$|Wollaston wire {{was used}} in early radio {{detectors}} known as electrolytic detectors [...] and the hot wire <b>barretter.</b> Other uses include suspension of delicate devices, sensing of temperature, and sensitive electrical power measurements.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the Audion, radio receivers had used a variety of detectors including coherers, <b>barretters,</b> and crystal detectors. The most popular crystal detector consisted of a small piece of galena crystal probed by a fine wire commonly referred to as a [...] "cat's-whisker detector". They were very unreliable, requiring frequent adjustment of the cat's whisker and offered no amplification. Such systems usually required the user to listen to the signal through headphones, sometimes at very low volume, as the only energy available to operate the headphones was that picked up by the antenna. For long distance communication huge antennas were normally required, and enormous amounts of electrical power had to be fed into the transmitter.|$|R
50|$|The first device used {{to demodulate}} audio signals, {{it was later}} {{superseded}} by the electrolytic detector, also generally attributed to Fessenden. The <b>barretter</b> principle is still used as a detector for microwave radiation, similar to a bolometer.|$|E
50|$|The {{hot wire}} <b>barretter</b> was a demodulating detector, invented in 1902 by Reginald Fessenden, that found limited use in early radio receivers. In effect {{it was a}} highly {{sensitive}} thermoresistor developed to permit the reception of amplitude modulated signals, something that the coherer (the standard detector of the time) could not do.|$|E
5000|$|An iron-hydrogen {{resistor}} {{consists of}} a hydrogen-filled glass bulb (similar to a light bulb), in which an iron wire is located. This resistor has a positive temperature coefficient of resistance. This characteristic made it useful for stabilizing circuits against fluctuations in power supply voltages. This device is often called a [...] "barretter" [...] because of its similarity to the <b>Barretter</b> used for detection of radio signals. The modern successor to the iron-hydrogen resistor is the current source.|$|E
5000|$|In 1902 Fessenden {{developed}} what {{he called}} a [...] "barretter" [...] detector that would rectify an AM signal, but it was not very sensitive. The <b>barretter</b> used a fine platinum wire, called Wollaston wire, manufactured as a platinum core in a silver sheath that had to be stripped off with acid. In the process of stripping some Wollaston wire, Fessenden left it immersed in acid too long, eating away most of the wire until only a tip remained in contact with the solution; he noted that it responded well to radio signals being generated nearby, and could be used as new type of detector.|$|E
50|$|More {{important}} for the future, the coherer could not detect AM (radio) transmissions. As a simple switch that registered {{the presence or absence}} of radio waves, the coherer could detect the on-off keying of wireless telegraphy transmitters, but it could not demodulate (rectify) the waveforms of AM radiotelephone signals, which began to be experimented with in the first years of the 20th century. This problem was solved by the rectification capability of Reginald Fessenden's hot wire <b>barretter</b> and electrolytic detector. These in turn were replaced by the crystal detector around 1906, and then around 1912 by vacuum tube technologies such as John Ambrose Fleming's thermionic diode and Lee De Forest's Audion (triode) tube.|$|E
50|$|In 1900 Fessenden left Pittsburgh to {{work for}} the United States Weather Bureau, with the {{objective}} of proving the practicality of using a network of coastal radio stations to transmit weather information, thereby avoiding the expense of the existing telegraph lines. The provisions of his contract called for him to be paid $3,000 per year, and provided with work space, assistance, and housing. The agreement gave the Weather Bureau access to any devices Fessenden developed, but he would retain ownership of his inventions. Fessenden quickly made major advances, especially in receiver design, as he worked to develop audio reception of signals. His initial success came from the invention of a <b>barretter</b> detector, which was followed by an electrolytic detector, which consisted of a fine wire dipped in nitric acid, and {{for the next few years}} this latter device would set the standard for sensitivity in radio reception.|$|E
50|$|The {{hot wire}} <b>barretter</b> {{depends upon the}} {{variation}} (usually an increase) of a metal's resistivity {{as a function of}} increasing temperature. The device is biased by a direct current adjusted to heat the wire to its most sensitive temperature. When there is an oscillating current from the antenna through the extremely fine platinum wire loop, the wire is further heated as the current increases and cools as the current decreases again. As the wire heats and cools, it varies its resistance in response to the signals passing through it. Because of the low thermal mass of the wire, it is capable of responding quickly enough to vary its resistance in response to audio signals. However, it cannot vary its resistance fast enough to respond to the much higher radio frequencies. The radio frequencies are essentially removed, and the sound is demodulated because the current through the circuit varies with the changing wire resistance. Headphones are connected in series with the D.C. circuit and the variations in the current are rendered as sound.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum tube {{equipment}} used {{a number of}} tubes, each with a heater requiring {{a certain amount of}} electrical power. In AC/DC equipment, the heaters of all the tubes are connected in series. All the tubes are rated at the same current (typically 100, 150, 300, or 450 mA) but at different voltages, according to their heating power requirements. If necessary, resistance (which can be a ballast tube (<b>barretter),</b> a power resistor or a resistive mains lead are added so that, when the mains voltage is applied across the chain, the specified heating current flows. Some types of ballast resistors were built into an envelope like a tube that was easily replaceable. With mains voltages of around 220 V, the power dissipated by the additional resistance and the voltage drop across it could be quite high, and it was common to use a resistive power cable (mains cord) of defined resistance, running warm, rather than putting a hot resistor inside the case. If a resistive power cable was used, an inexperienced repairer might replace it with a standard cable, or use the wrong length, damaging the equipment and risking a fire.|$|E
