30|$|After {{reviewing}} the full texts of 65 publications, 59 were excluded. Thirty-two publications <b>were</b> <b>not</b> formal {{reviews of the}} literature (for example they did not describe their search methods). Other reviews <b>were</b> excluded <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> about implementation (n =[*] 15); were focused on the measurement properties of PROMs (n =[*] 11) or were about using PROMs in a research context (n-[*]=[*] 1). Of the 15 reviews excluded <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> about implementation, 12 focused {{on the impact of}} PROMs, such as whether they improved clinical outcomes or patient satisfaction. The review team were initially uncertain about whether to include these, but ultimately excluded them <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> about implementation in routine practice.|$|R

5|$|A second {{specimen}} {{was obtained}} in 1966 and the find {{was published in}} 1971 by Hugh Genoways and Knox Jones, who noted that the species is closely similar to O.palustris. Later workers affirmed the relationship between O.dimidiatus, O.palustris and associated species like O.couesi. Fiona Reid reported in 1997 that a third specimen had been found. In 2006, Marcelo Weksler and coworkers removed most of the species formerly placed in Oryzomys from the genus, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{closely related to the}} type species O.palustris, but kept O.dimidiatus as an Oryzomys.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{theories}} of constraints {{focus on how}} children learn nouns, but ignore other aspects of their word learning. Although constraints are useful in explaining how children limit possible meanings when learning novel words, the same constraints would eventually need to be overridden <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> utilized in adult language. For instance, adult speakers often use several terms, each term meaning something slightly different, when referring to one entity, such as a family pet. This practice would violate the mutual exclusivity constraint.|$|E
5|$|Surveys {{are needed}} to {{determine}} existing population densities and habitat viability for all species of slow loris. Connectivity between protected areas is important for slow lorises <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> adapted to dispersing across the ground over large distances. For successful reintroductions, connectivity between sites with low population density is considered ideal. Protected area extensions are also needed in Borneo, Java, and Sumatra.|$|E

5|$|Until this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} a {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Some supported the idea that GRBs occur within the Milky Way, but are visibly faint <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and are extremely energetic. Although the possibility of multiple types of GRBs meant that the two theories were not mutually exclusive, the distance measurement unequivocally placed {{the source of the}} GRB outside the Milky Way, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
5|$|When a new seal was {{unveiled}} in June 2011, it received several negative {{feedback from the}} students through social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. The changes were made after the Curia in Rome suggested for a uniformity in the titles and name of UST. The university's council of Regents decided to include UST's name in the new seal and drop the titles of Royal and Pontifical <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> part of the official name of university. The seal was revised a month after and is currently being used today.|$|E
5|$|Most {{sharks are}} carnivorous. Basking sharks, whale sharks, and megamouth sharks have {{independently}} evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton: basking sharks practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction {{to take in}} plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires gill rakers—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve—analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales. The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows {{from time to time}} in huge mouthfuls. Teeth in these species are comparatively small <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> needed for feeding.|$|E

5|$|Prior to this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested {{that they do not}} occur within the disk of the Milky Way, some astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the Milky Way's halo, concluding that the bursts are visibly faint <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected because they are extremely energetic. The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
5|$|The Bengal slow loris {{is not a}} {{seasonal}} breeder, unlike the pygmy slow loris. Females in an estrous cycle attract males with a loud whistle. Females reproduce every 12–18months and have a six-month gestation. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> seasonal breeders, females could become pregnant when their offspring are approximately 6 months old, making possible for females to produce two offspring per year. Females typically {{give birth to a}} single offspring, although twins rarely occur. This differs from the sympatric pygmy slow loris, which commonly has twins. The mother carries her young about three months before they become independent, although they may be temporarily left on branches while the mother searches for food. Sexual maturity is reached at approximately 20months of age. The species is known to live up to 20years.|$|E
5|$|The {{muscles and}} nerves are much simpler {{than those of}} most other animals, {{although}} more specialised than in other cnidarians, such as corals. Cells in the outer layer (epidermis) and the inner layer (gastrodermis) have microfilaments that group into contractile fibers. These fibers are not true muscles <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> freely suspended in the body cavity {{as they are in}} more developed animals. Longitudinal fibres are found in the tentacles and oral disc, and also within the mesenteries, where they can contract the whole length of the body. Circular fibers are found in the body wall and, in some species, around the oral disc, allowing the animal to retract its tentacles into a protective sphincter.|$|E

5|$|The {{teeth were}} long and slender, {{as opposed to the}} usually very short teeth seen in other abelisaurids. On each side of the upper jaws there were four premaxillary and twelve maxillary teeth, while the lower jaws were {{equipped}} with fifteen dentary teeth per side. In contrast to the robust-looking skull, the lower jaw was shallow and weakly constructed, with the dentary (the foremost jaw bone) connected to the hindmost jaw bones by only two contact points. The lower jaw was found with hyoid bones, in the position they would be in if the animal was alive. These slender bones, supporting the tongue musculature and several other muscles, are rarely found in dinosaurs <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> connected to other bones and therefore get lost easily.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins are {{classified}} as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. In humans there are 13 vitamins: 4 fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and 9 water-soluble (8 B vitamins and vitamin C). Water-soluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and, in general, are readily excreted from the body, {{to the degree that}} urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> as readily stored, more consistent intake is important. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed through the intestinal tract with the help of lipids (fats). Because {{they are more likely to}} accumulate in the body, they are more likely to lead to hypervitaminosis than are water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamin regulation is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} his first for Starbucks' Hear Music record label, after {{previously}} having a 45-year-old relationship with Capitol/EMI. The recording contract with Capitol/EMI ended a few {{months prior to the}} release of the album, after McCartney had found out that EMI were planning to take six months to set up a promotional plan for the album. McCartney was the first artist to sign to Hear Music. The album was released on 4 June 2007 in the UK, and a day later on the 5th in the US, and with a vinyl edition later in the month on 25 June. In the US, Memory Almost Full debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 with about 161,000 copies sold within the first week, making it McCartney's highest-charting album there since 1997's Flaming Pie. 47% of the album sales from the opening week were from Starbucks coffee shops, which were the best sales for any album in the history of Starbucks. While it was announced that copies of the album sold in the Starbucks coffee shops in the UK would not be counted by the Official UK Charts, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> registered in the copies counting system, Memory Almost Full, however, still managed to hit number 5 on the UK Album Charts. The album was also peaked at number 1 on Billboard Internet Sales Chart, and number 3 on Billboard Top Internet Albums Downloads.|$|E
