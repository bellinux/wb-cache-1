5|$|The largest {{commercial}} use of Se, accounting for about 50% of consumption, {{is for the}} production of glass. Se compounds confer a red color to glass. This color cancels out the green or yellow tints that arise from iron impurities typical for most glass. For this purpose, various selenite and selenate salts are added. For other applications, a red color may <b>be</b> <b>desired,</b> produced by mixtures of CdSe and CdS.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, it {{was found}} that the {{handling}} of armoured forces during the campaign left much to <b>be</b> <b>desired.</b> During the beginning of Guderian's attack in northern Poland, his corps was held back to coordinate with infantry for quite a while, preventing a faster advance. It was only after Army Group South had its attention taken from Warsaw at the Battle of Bzura that Guderian's armour was fully unleashed. There were still lingering tendencies to reserve Germany's armour, even if in independent divisions, to cover an infantry advance or the flanks of advancing infantry armies. Although tank production was increased to 125 tanks per month after the Polish Campaign, losses forced the Germans to draw further strength from Czech tank designs, and light tanks continued to form the majority of Germany's armored strength.|$|E
5|$|The initial French {{attack was}} aimed at seizing the three Russian {{positions}} collectively known as the Bagration flèches, four arrow-head shaped, open-backed earthworks which arced out to the left en échelon {{in front of the}} Kolocha stream. These positions helped support the Russian left, which had no terrain advantages. There was much to <b>be</b> <b>desired</b> {{in the construction of the}} flèches, one officer noting that the ditches were much too shallow, the embrasures open to the ground, making them easy to enter, and that they were much too wide exposing infantry inside them. The flèches were supported by artillery from the village of Semyanovskaya, whose elevation dominated the other side of the Kolocha.|$|E

5|$|In June 2015, {{two members}} of the Security Committee of the Czech Parliament visited Uherský Brod and talked to {{multiple}} witnesses. The MPs issued a report condemning handling of the situation by the police. Among other issues, the MPs criticized that policemen parked their cars and put bullet proof vests on within the shooting range of the attacker, initially failed to get information from the witnesses and only later during the intervention attempted to contact them, didn't cover the back exit and thus potentially allowed the perpetrator {{to get out of the}} object and jeopardize other people. The police even let a helicopter land within the shooting range of the attacker. According to MPs, the police left much to <b>be</b> <b>desired</b> in regards of communication and most importantly, they wrongly decided to believe the perpetrator's claim of having hostage even though the witnesses could have readily confirmed that everyone inside was most likely dead. The policemen didn't seal the vicinity of the attack until 1pm and used civilian phones in communication with superior officers instead of using either their own phones or radio transmitters. Minister of Interior Chovanec commented that the MPs failed to interview the policemen and thus didn't get all the relevant information.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the context}} of a stigmatic-eligibilic paraphilia, what is {{considered}} repulsive, unsuitable, prohibited, abnormal or taboo by most people turns into something attractive, suitable, permitted, normal and licensed. Thus, in paedophilia, necrophilia and zoophilia, children, corpses and animals <b>are</b> <b>desired</b> despite being incapable of forming sexual (or, indeed, any) relationships. In the attraction to disability, disabled people <b>are</b> <b>desired</b> despite deviating from the physical standard. In gerontophilia and ephebophilia, significantly older or younger people <b>are</b> <b>desired</b> despite being generally considered unsuitable due to great difference in age. In hybristophilia, notorious criminals <b>are</b> <b>desired</b> despite being generally considered objectionable. In urolagnia, coprophilia and emetophilia, urinating, defecating and vomiting in intimate circumstances are seen as arousing despite the general views that they are repulsive. In this sense, stigmatic-eligibilic paraphilias can seem 'non-conformist' and 'taboo-busting.' ...|$|R

25|$|Apertures are annular {{metallic}} plates, {{through which}} electrons that are further than a fixed {{distance from the}} optic axis may be excluded. These consist of a small metallic disc that is sufficiently thick to prevent electrons from passing through the disc, whilst permitting axial electrons. This permission of central electrons in a TEM causes two effects simultaneously: firstly, apertures decrease the beam intensity as electrons are filtered from the beam, which may <b>be</b> <b>desired</b> {{in the case of}} beam sensitive samples. Secondly, this filtering removes electrons that are scattered to high angles, which may be due to unwanted processes such as spherical or chromatic aberration, or due to diffraction from interaction within the sample.|$|E
25|$|As {{technology}} improved, so {{also did}} {{the kinds of}} innovative performances Tibbits {{was able to put}} on stage. Such obscure technologies as cinematoscopes and luminere cinematographs offered the promise of displaying moving pictures. Kleine's Lumiere Cinematograph promised families the chance to see their sons in the Spanish–American War march toward the camera. Thomas Edison's Magniscope never reached Coldwater because it exploded en route, but his Animotoscope did. Eventually the Lyman H. Howe Company offered genuine moving pictures with its Vivograph Graphophone, which depicted a train ride through the Rocy Mountain's Frazer River Canyon. While such technologies had much to <b>be</b> <b>desired</b> in terms of quality, they were nonetheless important steps in the march toward the modern cinema.|$|E
25|$|Quine's work in logic {{gradually}} became dated in some respects. Techniques {{he did not}} teach and discuss include analytic tableaux, recursive functions, and model theory. His treatment of metalogic left something to <b>be</b> <b>desired.</b> For example, Mathematical Logic does not include any proofs of soundness and completeness. Early in his career, the notation of his writings on logic was often idiosyncratic. His later writings nearly always employed the now-dated notation of Principia Mathematica. Set against all this are the simplicity of his preferred method (as exposited in his Methods of Logic) for determining the satisfiability of quantified formulas, the richness of his philosophical and linguistic insights, and the fine prose in which he expressed them.|$|E
