40|$|Magnetic {{bearings}} {{have demonstrated}} the capability for achieving positioning accuracies at the nanometer level in precision motion control stages. This makes possible the positioning of a wafer in {{six degrees of freedom}} with the precision necessary for photolithography. To control the position of an object at the nanometer level, a model of the magnetic bearing actuator force-current-airgap relationship must be accurately obtained. Additionally, to reduce thermal effects the design of the actuator should be optimized to achieve maximum power efficiency and flux density. Optimization of the actuator is accomplished by proper pole face sizing and utilizing a magnetic core material which can be magnetized to the highest flux density with low magnetic loss properties. This paper describes the construction of a magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>calibration</b> fixture designed for experimental measurement of the actuator force characteristics. The results of a material study that review the force properties of nickel-steel, silicon-steel, and cobalt-vanadium-iron, as they apply to magnetic bearing applications are also presented...|$|E
40|$|NREL has {{initiated}} the Gearbox Reliability Collaborative (GRC) {{to investigate the}} root cause of the low wind turbine gearbox reliability. The GRC follows a multi-pronged approach based on a collaborative of manufacturers, owners, researchers and consultants. The project combines analysis, field testing, dynamometer testing, condition monitoring, and the development and population of a gearbox failure database. At the core of the project are two 750 kW gearboxes that have been redesigned and rebuilt so that they are representative of the multi-megawatt gearbox topology currently used in the industry. These gearboxes are heavily instrumented and are tested in the field and on the dynamometer. This report discusses the <b>bearing</b> <b>calibrations</b> of the gearboxes...|$|R
40|$|While {{both the}} U. S. Navstar GPS and the Soviet GLONASS will furnish users {{consistent}} global coverage for position fixes, neither system is certifiable as a sole-source navigation system because {{not enough of}} its satellites will be in view of vehicular receivers at one time to satisfy the redundancy and system-monitoring standards of the FAA and ICAO. A hybrid receiver employing combined signals from both satellite fleets will overcome this problem. While recent test flight results confirm the feasibility of precision landing approaches conducted by these means, issues <b>bearing</b> on <b>calibration,</b> standardization, and organization remain to be resolved politically and diplomatically...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} {{a simple and}} very efficient strategy to extrinsically calibrate a bearing sensor (e. g. a camera) mounted on a mobile robot and simultaneously estimate the parameters describing the systematic error of the robot odometry system. The paper provides two contributions. The first one is the analytical computation to derive {{the part of the}} system which is observable when the robot accomplishes circular trejectories. This computation consists in performing a local decomposition of the system, based on the theory of distributions. In this respect, this paper represents the first application of the distribution theory in the frame-work of mobile robotics. Then, starting from this decomposition, a method to efficiently estimate the parameters describing both the extrinsic <b>bearing</b> sensor <b>calibration</b> and the odometry calibration is derived (second contribution). Simulations and experiments with the robot e-Puck equipped with encoder sensors and a camera validate the approach...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{considers the}} problem of sensor self-calibration in mobile robotics by only using a single point feature. In particular, it is introduced a simple and efficient strategy to extrinsically calibrate a bearing sensor (e. g. a vision sensor) mounted on a vehicle and simultaneously estimate the parameters describing the systematic error of its odometry system. Special attention is devoted to investigate the dependence of the observability properties of these parameters on the chosen robot trajectory. The document provides two contributions. The first one is the analytical derivation of the combinations of these parameters which are observable for a given robot trajectory. This derivation requires to perform a local decomposition of the system, based on the theory of distributions. In this respect, this document represents the first application of the distribution theory in the frame-work of mobile robotics. Then, starting from this decomposition, {{it is possible to}} analytically derive the expression of the bearing angle of the feature in the bearing sensor local frame vs the curve length of the robot trajectory as evaluated by the odometry. Starting from this expression, a method to efficiently estimate the parameters describing both the extrinsic <b>bearing</b> sensor <b>calibration</b> and the odometry calibration is derived (second contribution). Many accurate simulations and real experiments with the robot e-Puck equipped with encoder sensors and a camera show the robustness the efficiency and the accuracy of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|For centuries, the {{improvement}} of machine tool accuracy has been the key enabler {{for the development of}} new technologies. The accuracy of machine tools depends mostly on the positioning accuracy of the tool with respect to the workpiece. The largest influences affecting this positioning accuracy are thermo-mechanical and geometrical errors. Reduction of thermal errors is currently achieved by placing the machine in a temperature-controlled environment, by employing low-expansion materials for the machine structure and by modelling and compensating thermal errors. Geometrical errors are generally reduced by air bearings or hydrostatic <b>bearings</b> and by <b>calibration</b> and numerical compensation of the motion errors. Despite these solutions, there are difficulties bringing the machining errors in normal machine tools below 1 µm and in ultra-precision machines consistently below 0. 1 µm. However, the elaborate application of certain precision engineering design principles, such as functional separation of the force loop and the metrology loop and the Abbe principle, could increase the accuracy of machine tools considerably. These principles have been applied in multiple ultra-precision machine tools and coordinate measurement machines (CMMs) based on laser interferometer position measurement and in a few CMMs utilising linear encoders. Nevertheless, the application of laser interferometry in machine tools requires complex and expensive additional measures to maintain the stability of the surrounding air's refractive index. Abbe-compliance of linear encoders, on the other hand, has not yet been investigated for machine tools and has only been implemented for CMMs in three degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) for a small work volume. The goal of this doctoral work was therefore to develop an Abbe-compliant linear encoder-based position measurement system for machine tools that enables sub- 100 nm precise machining. The system requires a 1 -D expanded measurement uncertainty (k= 2) of 20 nm for a measurement range of 100 mm in ambient conditions of (20 +/- 0. 5) °C and +/- 5...|$|R
