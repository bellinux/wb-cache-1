5|$|In June 1970, a long {{article on}} The Castafiore Emerald by French philosopher and author, Michel Serres, {{appeared}} in the literary review, Critique, under the title, Les <b>Bijoux</b> distraits ou la cantarice sauve.|$|E
500|$|The Castafiore Emerald was serialised weekly from 4 July 1961 to 4 September 1962 in Tintin {{magazine}} {{and published in}} book form as Les <b>Bijoux</b> de la Castafiore by Casterman in 1963. For the English version of the book, the gramophone record that Tintin receives from Castafiore, which is the [...] "Jewel Song" [...] from Charles Gounod's Faust, is titled [...] "Margarethe", the name by which Gounod's opera is known in Germany but not in England.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Barbie years, BillyBoy* invented Mdvanii {{as his own}} [...] "fashion doll", this time not a commercially made toy, but an artistic creation. Mdvanii is an {{original}} concept and patented sculpting, inspired by 1950s and 60s fashion dolls. The looks originate from BillyBoy*'s Russian-origin mother by adoption. [...] The doll was first made and shown in BillyBoy*'s Paris-based Surreal <b>Bijoux</b> showroom.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, French writers {{kept their}} stride. One genre, which vies in oddness with the English [...] "Merryland" [...] productions, was {{inspired}} by the newly translated Arabian Nights and involved the transformation of people into objects which were in propinquity with or employed in sexual relationships: such as sofas, dildos and even bidets. The climax of this trend is represented in French philosopher Diderot's Les <b>Bijoux</b> indiscrets (1747) in which a magic ring is employed to get women's vaginas to give an account of their intimate sexual histories.|$|E
2500|$|The modern fame of the Nights {{derives from}} the first known European {{translation}} by Antoine Galland, which appeared in 1704. According to Robert Irwin, Galland [...] "played so large a part in discovering the tales, in popularizing them in Europe and in shaping what would come {{to be regarded as}} the canonical collection that, at some risk of hyperbole and paradox, he has been called the real author of the Nights." [...] The immediate success of Galland's version with the French public may have been because it coincided with the vogue for contes de fées ("fairy stories"). This fashion began with the publication of Madame d'Aulnoy's Histoire d'Hypolite in 1690. D'Aulnoy's book has a remarkably similar structure to the Nights, with the tales told by a female narrator. The success of the Nights spread across Europe {{and by the end of}} the century there were translations of Galland into English, German, Italian, Dutch, Danish, Russian, Flemish and Yiddish. Galland's version provoked a spate of pseudo-Oriental imitations. At the same time, some French writers began to parody the style and concoct far-fetched stories in superficially Oriental settings. These tongue-in-cheek pastiches include Anthony Hamilton's Les quatre Facardins (1730), Crébillon's [...] (1742) and Diderot's Les <b>bijoux</b> indiscrets (1748). They often contained veiled allusions to contemporary French society. The most famous example is Voltaire's Zadig (1748), an attack on religious bigotry set against a vague pre-Islamic Middle Eastern background. The English versions of the [...] "Oriental Tale" [...] generally contained a heavy moralising element, with the notable exception of William Beckford's fantasy Vathek (1786), which had a decisive influence on the development of the Gothic novel. The Polish nobleman Jan Potocki's novel Saragossa Manuscript (begun 1797) owes a deep debt to the Nights with its Oriental flavour and labyrinthine series of embedded tales.|$|E
60|$|And the {{intention}} of the pleasantry is pointed by a malicious footnote, to the effect that people who might be surprised that a serious man like Valère should have written works of this licentious and frivolous kind, will conceive that in a moment of leisure a philosopher should write Les <b>Bijoux</b> Indiscrèts, for instance, and the next day follow it by a treatise on morality,[195]--as Diderot unhappily had done.|$|E
6000|$|The {{far greater}} part of the volume, however, {{contains}} pieces which can be little gratifying to the public:--some are pretty; and all are besprinkled with [...] "gems," [...] and [...] "roses," [...] and [...] "birds," [...] and [...] "diamonds," [...] and such like cheap poetical adornments, as are always to be obtained at no great expense of thought or of metre.--It is happy for the author that these <b>bijoux</b> are presented to persons of high degree; countesses, foreign and domestic; [...] "Maids of Honour to Louisa Landgravine of Hesse D'Armstadt;" [...] Lady Blank, and Lady Asterisk, besides---, and---, and others anonymous; who are {{exactly the kind of}} people to be best pleased with these sparkling, shining, fashionable trifles. We will solace our readers with three stanzas of the soberest of these odes: ...|$|E
60|$|Mirah {{said that}} she had slept well that night; and when she came down in Mab's black dress, her dark hair curling in fresh fibrils as it {{gradually}} dried from its plenteous bath, she looked like one who was beginning to take comfort after the long sorrow and watching which had paled her cheek and made blue semicircles under her eyes. It was Mab who carried her breakfast and ushered her down--with some pride in the effect produced by a pair of tiny felt slippers which she had rushed out to buy because there were no shoes in the house small enough for Mirah, whose borrowed dress ceased about her ankles and displayed the cheap clothing that, moulding itself on her feet, seemed an adornment as choice as the sheaths of buds. The farthing buckles were <b>bijoux.</b>|$|E
60|$|They were whisked away, having first duly {{gone through}} the amount of badgering which the bride and bridegroom have to suffer at the wedding breakfast-table. They drank their own health in champagne. Alaric made a speech, {{in which he said}} he was quite unworthy of his present happiness, and Gertrude picked up all the <b>bijoux,</b> gold pencil-cases, and silver cream-jugs, which were thrown at her from all sides. All the men made speeches, and all the women laughed, but the speech of the day was that celebrated one made by Sir Gregory, in which he gave a sketch of Alaric Tudor as the beau idéal of a clerk in the Civil Service. 'His heart,' said he, energetically, 'is at the Weights and Measures;' but Gertrude looked at him as though she did not believe a word of it.|$|E
60|$|After the Husband and Wife were buried, the Crew return'd on Board, {{and gave}} an Account {{of what had}} pass'd; the Captains Wives (for Misson and his were on Board the <b>Bijoux,</b> the Name they had given their Prize from her Make and Gilding) seem'd {{not in the least}} surprized, and Caraccioli's Lady only said, she must be of noble Descent, for none but the Families of the Nobility had the Privilege allowed them of {{following}} their Husbands on pain, if they transgressed, of being thrown into the Sea, to be eat by Fish; and they knew, that their Souls could not rest as long as any of the Fish, who fed upon them, lived. Misson asked, if they intended to have done the same Thing had they died? We should not, answer'd his Wife, have disgraced our Families; nor is our Tenderness for our Husbands inferior to hers whom you seem to admire.|$|E
6000|$|Moi, je suis tres calme. Je suis tout a fait calme. Ecoutez. J'ai des <b>bijoux</b> caches ici que meme votre mere n'a jamais vus, des <b>bijoux</b> tout a fait extraordinaires. J'ai un collier de perles a quatre rangs. On dirait des lunes enchainees de rayons d'argent. On dirait cinquante lunes captives dans un filet d'or. Une reine l'a porte sur l'ivoire de ses seins. Toi, quand tu le porteras, tu seras aussi belle qu'une reine. J'ai des amethystes de deux especes. Une qui est noire comme le vin. L'autre qui est rouge comme du vin qu'on a colore avec de l'eau. J'ai des topazes jaunes comme les yeux des tigres, et des topazes roses comme les yeux des pigeons, et des topazes vertes comme les yeux des chats. J'ai des opales qui brulent toujours avec une flamme qui est tres froide, des opales qui attristent les esprits et ont peur des tenebres. J'ai des onyx semblables aux prunelles d'une morte. J'ai des selenites qui changent quand la lune change et deviennent pales quand elles voient le soleil. J'ai des saphirs grands comme des oeufs et bleus comme des fleurs bleues. La mer erre dedans, et la lune ne vient jamais troubler le bleu de ses flots. J'ai des chrysolithes et des beryls, j'ai des chrysoprases et des rubis, j'ai des {{sardonyx}} et des hyacinthes, et des calcedoines et je vous les donnerai tous, mais tous, et j'ajouterai d'autres choses. Le roi des Indes vient justement de m'envoyer quatre eventails faits de plumes de perroquets, et le roi de Numidie une robe faite de plumes d'autruche. J'ai un cristal qu'il n'est pas permis aux femmes de voir et que meme les jeunes hommes ne doivent regarder qu'apres avoir ete flagelles de verges. Dans un coffret de nacre j'ai trois turquoises merveilleuses. Quand on les porte sur le {{front on}} peut imaginer des choses qui n'existent pas, et quand on les porte dans la main on peut rendre les femmes steriles. Ce sont des tresors de grande valeur. Ce sont des tresors sans prix. Et ce n'est pas tout. Dans un coffret d'ebene j'ai deux coupes d'ambre qui ressemblent a des pommes d'or. Si un ennemi verse du poison dans ces coupes elles deviennent comme des pommes d'argent. Dans un coffret incruste d'ambre j'ai des sandales incrustees de verre. J'ai des manteaux qui viennent du pays des Seres et des bracelets garnis d'escarboucles et de jade qui viennent de la ville d'Euphrate. [...] . Enfin, que veux-tu, Salome? Dis-moi ce que tu desires et je te le donnerai. Je te donnerai tout ce que tu demanderas, sauf une chose. Je te donnerai tout ce que je possede, sauf une vie. Je te donnerai le manteau du grand pretre. Je te donnerai le voile du sanctuaire.--Salome.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile Joseph {{had brought}} a trayful of small articles. [...] "Now, ladies," [...] said Mr. Trumbull, taking {{up one of the}} articles, [...] "this tray {{contains}} a very recherchy lot--a collection of trifles for the drawing-room table--and trifles make the sum of human things--nothing more important than trifles--(yes, Mr. Ladislaw, yes, by-and-by)--but pass the tray round, Joseph--these <b>bijoux</b> must be examined, ladies. This I have in my hand is an ingenious contrivance--a sort of practical rebus, I may call it: here, you see, it looks like an elegant heart-shaped box, portable--for the pocket; there, again, it becomes like a splendid double flower--an ornament for the table; and now"--Mr. Trumbull allowed the flower to fall alarmingly into strings of heart-shaped leaves--"a book of riddles! No less than five hundred printed in a beautiful red. Gentlemen, if I had less of a conscience, I should not wish you to bid high for this lot--I have a longing for it myself. What can promote innocent mirth, and I may say virtue, more than a good riddle?--it hinders profane language, and attaches a man to the society of refined females. This ingenious article itself, without the elegant domino-box, card-basket, &c., ought alone to give a high price to the lot. Carried in the pocket it might make an individual welcome in any society. Four shillings, sir?--four shillings for this remarkable collection of riddles with the et caeteras. Here is a sample: 'How must you spell honey to make it catch lady-birds? Answer--money.' You hear?--lady-birds--honey money. This is an amusement to sharpen the intellect; it has a sting--it has what we call satire, and wit without indecency. Four-and-sixpence--five shillings." ...|$|E
60|$|Caraccioli {{kept his}} Bed two Months, but Misson seeing {{him in a}} fair way of Recovery, took what Hands could be spar'd from the <b>Bijoux,</b> leaving her {{sufficient}} for Defence, and went out, having mounted ten of the Portuguese Guns, for he had hitherto carried but thirty, though he had Ports for forty. He stretched over to Madagascar, and coasted along this Island to the Northward, {{as far as the}} most northerly Point, when turning back, he enter'd a Bay to the northward of Diego Suares. He run ten Leagues up this Bay, and on the larboard Side found it afforded a large, and safe, Harbour, with plenty of fresh Water. He came here to an Anchor, went ashore and examined into the Nature of the Soil, which he found rich, the Air wholesome, and the Country level. He told his Men, that this was an excellent Place for an Asylum, and that he determined here to fortify and raise a small Town, and make Docks for Shipping, that they might have some Place to call their own; and a Receptacle, when Age or Wounds had render'd them incapable of Hardship, where they might enjoy the Fruits of their Labour, and go to their Graves in Peace. That he would not, however, set about this, till he had the Approbation of the whole Company; and were he sure they would all approve this Design, which he hoped, it being evidently for the general Good, he should not think it adviseable to begin any Works, lest the Natives should, in his Absence, destroy them; but however, as they had nothing upon their Hands, if they were of his Opinion, they might begin to fall and square Timber, ready for the raising a wooden Fort, when they return'd with their Companions.|$|E
6000|$|And {{the women}} of France! If the men are bound in that mysterious kinship, how much more so are the women! What is it in the Frenchwoman which makes her so utterly unique? A {{daughter}} in one of Anatole France's books says to her mother: [...] "Tu es pour les <b>bijoux,</b> je suis pour les dessous." [...] The Frenchwoman spiritually is pour les dessous. There is in her a kind of inherited, conservative, clever, dainty capability; {{no matter where you}} go in France, or in what class--country or town--you find it. She cannot waste, she cannot spoil, she makes and shows--the best of everything. If I were asked for a concrete illustration of self-respect I should say--the Frenchwoman. It is a particular kind of self-respect, no doubt, very much limited to this world; and perhaps beginning to be a little frayed. We have some Frenchwomen at the hospital, the servants who keep us in running order--the dear cook whom we love not only for her baked meats, proud of her soldier son once a professor, now a sergeant, and she a woman of property, with two houses in the little town; patient, kind, very stubborn about her dishes, which have in them the essential juices and savours which characterise all things really French. She has great sweetness and self-containment in her small, wrinkled, yellowish face; always quietly polite and grave, she bubbles deliciously at any joke, and gives affection sagaciously to those who merit. A jewel, who must be doing something pour la France. And we have Madame Jeanne Camille, mother of two daughters and one son, too young to be a soldier. It was her eldest daughter who wanted to come and scrub in the hospital, but was refused because she was too pretty. And her mother came instead. A woman who did not need to come, and nearly fifty, but strong, as the French are strong, with good red blood, deep colouring, hair still black, and handsome straight features. What a worker! A lover of talk, too, and of a joke when she has time. And Claire, of a languissante temperament, as she says; but who would know it? Eighteen, with a figure abundant as that of a woman of forty, but just beginning to fine down; holding herself as French girls learn to hold themselves so young; and with the pretty eyes of a Southern nymph, clear-brown and understanding, and a little bit wood-wild. Not self-conscious--like the English girl at that age--fond of work and play; with what is called [...] "a good head" [...] on her, and a warm heart. A real woman of France.|$|E
