40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} desicribing of common axle types, their modern solutions and modifications, which are brought by a usage of electronic and hydraulic systems, and discusses their properties as well. The next {{part of the}} thesis deals with types of axle differentials and their modern electronic substitutes. The most common brake types, <b>brake</b> <b>assistant</b> systems and main types of vehicle wheels are mentioned in the last chapter...|$|E
40|$|A {{verification}} {{case study}} of a complex real-time system from the automotive area, an emergency <b>brake</b> <b>assistant,</b> is conducted. In particular the application and usefulness of formal methods in the refinement process during {{the design of a}} large system is investigated, where we mean by “large system ” a system which cannot be formally verified as a whole due to its complexity. We establish that the application of formal methods in the early phase of a system design is beneficial despite the limits of current tools. Useful directions of further work to improve the verified design of safety-critical systems are also shown. ...|$|E

[...] It {{also features a}} speed-limiting device called 'maximum speed control' (MSC), and is fitted with an accident data recorder (ADR). [...] An optional feature is the 'lane guard system' (LGS), which will vibrate the drivers seat should the coach drift out of its lane.|$|R

In 2016, Mercedes also introduced its Active Brake Assist 4, which was the first emergency <b>braking</b> <b>assistant</b> with pedestrian recognition on the market.|$|R

40|$|English When {{developing}} modern {{control systems}} like anti-lock braking systems (ABS), traction control (TC), <b>brake</b> <b>assistant</b> (BAS) and electronic stability programs (ESP) to increase safety and comfort in vehi-cles, accurate tyre models are very important. Numerical simulation models {{are needed to}} predict the vehicle’s behaviour for various driving conditions. Testing facilities like the tyre measurement tower are needed to provide the necessary experimental data to validate these tyre models. The tyre measurement tower of the Dynamics and Control section of the TU Eindhoven, is already capable of simulating different situations, but it needs hydraulic actuators to subject the wheel to vertical vibra-tions and alternating steer angles. This report discusses {{the design of a}} vertical hydraulic actuator for the tyre measurement tower. A theoretical model of the hydraulic actuator and the measurement tower is developed, to determine what size of hydraulic cylinder is needed to fulfill the demands for good tyre measurement. This is done for a-symmetrical and symmetrical cylinder types. The size of these hydraulic cylinders limit the choice between servo valves, and this choice has a substantial effect on the dynamics of the total system. Some available hydraulic cylinders and servo valves ar...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{discussed}} the working {{principle of the}} hydraulic brake system, and built a model in the simulation by using AMESim to analyze performance of this system. The paper also established a test bench of hydraulic brake system, and the test result coincided with the consequence of simulation, thus to prove the simulation model and method reasonable. This simulation can shorten design cycle of hydraulic brake system apparently, and it contributes a good method to <b>assistant</b> <b>brake</b> system design...|$|R
