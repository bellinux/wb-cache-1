25|$|Type 4 RTA is not {{actually}} a tubular disorder at all {{nor does it}} have a clinical syndrome similar to the other types of RTA described above. It was included in the classification of renal tubular acidoses as it is associated with a mild (normal anion gap) metabolic acidosis due to a physiological reduction in proximal tubular ammonium excretion (impaired ammoniagenesis), which is secondary to hypoaldosteronism, and results in a decrease in urine <b>buffering</b> <b>capacity.</b> Its cardinal feature is hyperkalemia, and measured urinary acidification is normal, hence it is often called hyperkalemic RTA or tubular hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|There {{are limits}} to electrophoretic techniques. Since passing current through a gel causes heating, gels may melt during electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is {{performed}} in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too long can exhaust the <b>buffering</b> <b>capacity</b> of the solution. There are also limitations in determining the molecular weight by SDS-PAGE, {{especially if you are}} trying to find the MW of an unknown protein. There are certain biological variables that are difficult or impossible to minimize and can affect the electrophoretic migration. Such factors include protein structure, post-translational modifications, and amino acid composition. For example, tropomyosin is an acidic protein that migrates abnormally on SDS-PAGE gels. This is because the acidic residues are repelled by the negatively charged SDS, leading to an inaccurate mass-to-charge ratio and migration. Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.|$|E
25|$|These buffers {{have plenty}} of ions in them, which is {{necessary}} for the passage of electricity through them. Something like distilled water or benzene contains few ions, which is not ideal for the use in electrophoresis. There are a number of buffers used for electrophoresis. The most common being, for nucleic acids Tris/Acetate/EDTA (TAE), Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE). Many other buffers have been proposed, e.g. lithium borate, which is almost never used, based on Pubmed citations (LB), iso electric histidine, pK matched goods buffers, etc.; in most cases the purported rationale is lower current (less heat) and or matched ion mobilities, which leads to longer buffer life. Borate is problematic; Borate can polymerize, and/or interact with cis diols such as those found in RNA. TAE has the lowest <b>buffering</b> <b>capacity</b> but provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM Lithium borate).|$|E

40|$|To analyse the {{influence}} of a finishing coat on the hygric <b>buffering</b> <b>capacities</b> of gypsum board, dynamic experiments are performed on uncoated and coated gypsum board samples. In these experiments a harmonically changing relative humidity is imposed, while the mass response of the sample is measured quasi-continuously. The measured response is compared with a numerically predicted response. To do so, gypsum board is implemented as a composite material in a FE-model with sorption isotherm and vapour permeability determined for each layer of the board separately. It is found that hysteresis on the sorption isotherm plays an important role on the dynamic response of coated gypsum board...|$|R
2500|$|The {{frequency}} with which teeth are exposed to cariogenic (acidic) environments affects the likelihood of caries development. [...] After meals or snacks, the bacteria in the mouth metabolize sugar, resulting in an acidic by-product that decreases pH. [...] As time progresses, the pH returns to normal due to the <b>buffering</b> <b>capacity</b> of saliva and the dissolved mineral content of tooth surfaces. [...] During every exposure to the acidic environment, portions of the inorganic mineral content at the surface of teeth dissolve and can remain dissolved for two hours. [...] Since teeth are vulnerable during these acidic periods, the development of dental caries relies heavily on the frequency of acid exposure.|$|E
2500|$|Besides {{diffusion}} and Joule heating (discussed above), {{factors that}} may decrease the resolution in capillary electrophoresis from the theoretical limits in the above equation include, {{but are not limited}} to, the finite widths of the injection plug and detection window; interactions between the analyte and the capillary wall; instrumental non-idealities such as a slight difference in height of the fluid reservoirs leading to siphoning; irregularities in the electric field due to, e.g., imperfectly cut capillary ends; depletion of <b>buffering</b> <b>capacity</b> in the reservoirs; and electrodispersion (when an analyte has higher conductivity than the background electrolyte). [...] Identifying and minimizing the numerous sources of band broadening is key to successful method development in capillary electrophoresis, with the objective of approaching {{as close as possible to}} the ideal of diffusion-limited resolution.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{things are}} {{required}} for caries formation: a tooth surface (enamel or dentin), caries-causing bacteria, fermentable carbohydrates (such as sucrose), and time. This involves adherence of food to the teeth and acid creation by the bacteria that makes up the dental plaque. [...] However, these four criteria are not always enough to cause the disease and a sheltered environment promoting development of a cariogenic biofilm is required. [...] The caries disease process {{does not have an}} inevitable outcome, and different individuals will be susceptible to different degrees depending on the shape of their teeth, oral hygiene habits, and the <b>buffering</b> <b>capacity</b> of their saliva. [...] Dental caries can occur on any surface of a tooth that is exposed to the oral cavity, but not the structures that are retained within the bone.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{canonical}} transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC 6) {{protein is}} a non-selective cation channel able to transport essential trace elements like iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) through the plasma membrane. Its over-expression in HEK- 293 cells causes an intracellular accumulation of Zn, indicating {{that it could}} be involved in Zn transport. This finding prompted us to better understand the role played by TRPC 6 in Zn homeostasis. Experiments done using the fluorescent probe FluoZin- 3 showed that HEK cells possess an intracellular pool of mobilisable Zn present in compartments sensitive to the vesicular proton pump inhibitor Baf-A, which affects endo/lysosomes. TRPC 6 over-expression facilitates the basal uptake of Zn and enhances the size of the pool of Zn sensitive to Baf-A. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments showed that TRPC 6 over-expression does not affect the mRNA expression of Zn transporters (ZnT- 1, ZnT- 5, ZnT- 6, ZnT- 7, ZnT- 9, Zip 1, Zip 6, Zip 7, and Zip 14); however it up-regulates the mRNA expression of metallothionein-I and -II. This alters the Zn <b>buffering</b> <b>capacities</b> of the cells as illustrated by the experiments done using the Zn ionophore Na pyrithione. In addition, HEK cells over-expressing TRPC 6 grow slower than their parental HEK cells. This feature can be mimicked by growing HEK cells in a culture medium supplemented with 5 μM of Zn acetate. Finally, a proteomic analysis revealed that TRPC 6 up-regulates the expression of the actin-associated proteins ezrin and cofilin- 1, and changes the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton without changing the cellular actin content. Altogether, these data indicate that TRPC 6 is participating in the transport of Zn and influences the Zn storage and <b>buffering</b> <b>capacities</b> of the cells...|$|R
50|$|Finely ground {{agricultural}} lime is often applied to acid soils to increase soil pH (liming). The amount of lime {{needed to change}} pH {{is determined by the}} mesh size of the lime (how finely it is ground) and the <b>buffering</b> <b>capacity</b> of the soil. A high mesh size (60 mesh = 0.25 mm; 100 mesh = 0.149 mm) indicates a finely ground lime that will react quickly with soil acidity. The <b>buffering</b> <b>capacity</b> of a soil depends on the clay content of the soil, the type of clay, and the amount of organic matter present, and {{may be related to the}} soil cation exchange capacity. Soils with high clay content will have a higher <b>buffering</b> <b>capacity</b> than soils with little clay, and soils with high organic matter will have a higher <b>buffering</b> <b>capacity</b> than those with low organic matter.

Changes in <b>buffering</b> <b>capacities</b> upon flash excitation were detected in (0. 03 % Triton X- 100) detergent solution of reaction centers from Rhodobacter (Rb.) sphaeroides and Rb. capsulatus wild type and mutant strains with empty or occupied secondary quinone (QB) binding sites {{in the presence of}} an external electron donor. The light-induced differences in <b>buffering</b> <b>capacities</b> between pH 4 and 11 were analyzed in terms of protonatable residues. Due to its differential nature, this method is more sensitive to the position and shift of pKa of the individual groups than the direct method based on proton uptake measurements. Out of the four different ionizable residues which were used to fit the curves, the two groups with apparent (dark) pKa values between 8. 4 – 8. 8 and 9. 5 – 10. 0 (depending on the species and conditions) disappeared when the native ubiquinone 10 was replaced by menadione at the primary quinone (QA) binding site of Rb. sphaeroides or when the key protonatable residues (L 212 Glu and L 213 Asp) were replaced by non-protonatable alanines in the QB binding site of the AA+M 43 D mutant from Rb. capsulatus. The experimentally observed acidic and neutral residues remained unchanged. These results obtained from modifications in both quinone sites reveal the origin of the alkaline pH groups: they reflect the interaction of QA− and the cluster of ionizable residues around L 212 Glu in the QB binding pocket. The involvement of two residues with close pKa values reflects the complex titration of the cluster. The interaction between the quinone pockets is best described qualitatively as a network of ionizable residues extending from the QA site to the QB site...|$|R
