5|$|Historian Jerry F. Hough {{notes that}} Gorbachev treated Ryzhkov and his reform {{attempts}} just as <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> Leonid Brezhnev treated Alexei Kosygin, one-time Chairman of the Council of Ministers, during the Brezhnev Era. Brezhnev's most notable snub {{was over the}} 1965 Soviet economic reform.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} season, Bart {{convinced}} Krusty {{to run for}} Congress so that Krusty could introduce an airline rerouting bill and stop planes from flying over the Simpsons' house. Krusty agreed and ran on the Republican ticket. Although his campaign started off badly, Lisa suggested that he try connecting with regular families, which Krusty did, resulting in a landslide victory. Krusty's term started off <b>badly,</b> <b>as</b> he was completely ignored by his new, more politically savvy colleagues. With {{the help of the}} Simpsons and an influential doorman, however, Krusty succeeded in passing his bill.|$|E
5|$|As in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, {{the severe}} drought during the El Niño of 1997 {{exacerbated}} the flood's disruption to crops in eastern Cuba. The heavy rainfall from Georges damaged the crops greatly, {{despite the effort}} to harvest them prior to its arrival. Up to 70% of the plantain crop, a chief food in the country's diet, was destroyed. The sugarcane crop fared <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> well, limiting one of the country's important export crops. The coffee and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane, further damaging the country's food supply. A total of 15,758 hectares of croplands as well as 36,040 tons of fruit were destroyed by Hurricane Georges. Agricultural losses from the storm were estimated at $15million.|$|E

5|$|By {{the start}} of the 21st century it became evident that the soft stone of the Cenotaph was deteriorating <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> a result of water damage and frost. Recutting the names on the {{monument}} was discounted as a solution due to the long term damage this repeated work would cause to the Cenotaph's structure: {{the decision was made to}} expand the war memorial instead. A glass wall consisting of eight large panels 2.85m (9ft) by 1.2m (4ft) in size, was built alongside the Cenotaph at a cost of £130,000. The panels were engraved with the names of the World War I casualties and, in addition, those from Southampton who had died in later conflicts. The Memorial Wall included a total of 2,368 names from the First World War, 927 from the Second World War and three from subsequent conflicts. This addition to the Cenotaph was opened on 11 December 2011.|$|E
5|$|Gugelmin entered Formula One, {{the highest}} {{category}} of circuit racing {{defined by the}} Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body, with the March team in 1988, as team-mate to Ivan Capelli. He had previously been in contention for a drive with Lotus in 1986 but was overlooked in favour of Johnny Dumfries. The season started <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> Gugelmin suffered five retirements from the first six races due to mechanical failure, but soon afterwards he took his first points scoring finish with fourth place at the British Grand Prix. Gugelmin scored points in one other race with fifth place at the Hungarian Grand Prix. He finished the season as the highest-scoring newcomer in the Formula One World Championship, ending the year in 13th position overall.|$|E
5|$|Ireland {{failed to}} qualify for Euro 96, despite a strong start to the group, when they won their opening three games, {{including}} a 4–0 win against Northern Ireland. The Republic's next game was also against Northern Ireland, although {{the result was a}} 1–1 draw. From that point onwards the Republic stuttered <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> injuries struck down key players such as Roy Keane, Andy Townsend, John Sheridan and Steve Staunton. After beating the highly fancied Portugal, the Irish then endured an embarrassing 0–0 draw to Liechtenstein (this was Liechtenstein's only point in their ten matches), before losing twice to Austria, on both occasions by three goals to one. Although they defeated Latvia, Ireland needed to beat Portugal in Lisbon to qualify outright, but lost 3–0. They finished second in the group, ahead of Northern Ireland on goal difference, but as the worst performing runners-up they had to win a play-off game at Anfield against the Netherlands; Ireland lost 2–0 after a brace from Patrick Kluivert. Charlton resigned shortly after the game.|$|E

25|$|On 29 March 1784, she {{was married}} to John Abraham Fisher, a 40-year-old {{composer}} and violinist. The marriage went <b>badly,</b> <b>as</b> Fisher abused and may have beaten her. Word of this got to the Emperor, who was heavily involved in running his opera company, and he ordered Fisher to leave Vienna. Fisher complied, moving to Ireland. Storace was pregnant with a child, which was born on 30 January 1785; this daughter, Josepha Fisher, lived until 17 July 1785.|$|E
25|$|The 1996–97 season started just as <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> the last, {{with three}} {{straight}} losses. However, {{the introduction of}} young forward Andrew Fotiadis saw Luton burst into life, as they shot up {{the table with a}} run of eight wins and two draws in eleven games. Tony Thorpe, too, proved to be a revelation, scoring 28 goals to become the division's top scorer. Luton were nearly promoted, but finished in third place on goal difference and then lost to Crewe Alexandra in the play-offs.|$|E
25|$|At {{the next}} race in Belgium Trulli struggled, only {{being able to}} finish 16th, as his gearbox was damaged in a {{collision}} with Sébastien Bourdais' Toro Rosso on the first lap. Timo Glock, on the other hand, was doing as <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> Trulli until a few laps {{before the end of}} the race the rain came down. Glock changed to wet tyres, and was able to move up the order to 8th place. After the race, however, Glock was penalized 25-seconds for overtaking Mark Webber under yellow flags during the final lap of the race. The penalty pushed Glock to ninth place.|$|E
50|$|Snow started {{falling in}} the early hours of March 14. Except for pockets, most of the snow {{dissipated}} in the night of March 14. Rhode Island wasn't <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> hit <b>as</b> other states, due to its location to the Atlantic Ocean. It toppled a wind turbine, due to winds.|$|R

25|$|Before the Communist takeover, the {{relationship}} between the Khampa and the Dalai Lama's Government had deteriorated <b>badly.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the Khampa were indifferent to the initial Communist assault on Chamdo. The PLA had entered Kham without much opposition from local Khampas. The relationship between the Khampa and the Tibetan Dalai Lama government in Lhasa was extremely poor at the time. Pandatsang Rapga, a pro Kuomintang and pro Republic of China revolutionary Khampa leader, offered the governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Ngawang Jigme, some Khampa fighters in exchange for the Tibetan government recognizing the independence of Kham. Ngabo refused the offer.|$|E
25|$|Al-Husayn's second {{campaign}} was to end as <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> the first. Once again the Turks defending the land between Baghdad and al-Anbar attacked the Baghdadi army. Al-Husayn {{was able to}} fight them off for several days, but eventually the Turks were able to outmaneuver him and rout the guards stationed on his flanks. When they attacked al-Husayn's army itself, they quickly defeated his men and overran his camp. Al-Husayn himself managed to escape on a river skiff, but a hundred of his men were killed and 170 had been taken prisoner, including several of the officers. Al-Husayn and the other survivors returned to Baghdad, {{and there were no}} further attempts to retake al-Anbar.|$|E
25|$|In November 1758, another {{petition}} {{was sent}} to Thomas Pownall, requesting that Timothy be allowed to purchase another 350 acres of the Stockbridges' land. During these times, church attendance was often mandatory at a certain frequency, and tythingmen were charged with {{making sure that the}} families under their watch were attending. If one failed to attend, they were given a choice of paying a fine or spending a day in the stocks. Such was the case with a group of Dutchmen in Great Barrington. Timothy advised them to go the stockade route rather than pay a fine, and even went as far as accompanying them to Sheffield, to ensure they weren't treated <b>badly,</b> <b>as</b> was usually the case with the stockades.|$|E

25|$|In a {{practice}} match preceding the first One Day International, a fifty over game was arranged against a strong Victorian side. The game was thirteen-a-side, but with only eleven players allowed to bat and eleven to field. Andrew Flintoff {{was allowed to}} rest, with the other World players all playing. By agreement the World batted first, but they fared <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> they collapsed from 63 for no loss to 131 for 6, with Shane Harwood taking 4 for 37. Rahul Dravid's knock of 66 off 80 balls and Shaun Pollock's cameo of 54 not out off only 38 balls rescued the innings, which finished on a competitive 281 for 8. Victoria came close in reply, with Brad Hodge top-scoring with 92 before succumbing to Muttiah Muralitharan.|$|E
25|$|Maria Pavlovana {{childhood}} {{was spent in}} splendor. Her early memories were of magnificent palaces and lazy country estates populated by armies of servants. Until she was six, Maria spoke Russian <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> all of her governesses and the immediate family spoke English. Later she had another governess, Mademoiselle Hélène who taught her French and stayed with her until her marriage. At {{the age of seven}} she traveled in her own personal railway car accompanied by her governess to visit Germany and France. On Sundays, she and her brother were allowed to play with children from aristocratic families. Growing up without a mother and with a frequently absent father, Grand Duchess Maria and her brother Dimitri became very close, relying on each other for affection and companionship.|$|E
25|$|The initial attack went <b>badly,</b> <b>as</b> the German {{troops were}} untrained for Arctic warfare and {{especially}} the SS division, merely a former police force, were unsuccessful {{in dealing with the}} organized Soviet defense. After repeated attacks failed, XXXVI Corps combined all its forces {{and with the help of}} a flanking attack by the Finnish 6th division the Soviet defenses were finally breached at 6 July. Salla was taken on 8 July, and the Soviets started a general retreat towards Kayraly to the east. XXXVI Corps sustained its momentum by pusuing the fleeing trops, and arrived at Kayral the next day. Kayraly was protected by heavy Soviet defense and large natural lakes around the town. This prevented any further German advance, rendering the situation into a stalemate for the remainder of the month.|$|E
