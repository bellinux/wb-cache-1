5|$|It is Christmas in Bikini Bottom and Plankton is {{miserable and}} angry for {{committing}} so many naughty deeds, {{that he always}} gets on Santa's naughty list, making him unable to receive his Christmas wishthe Krusty Krab's Krabby Patty secret formula. However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as a}} trap for the citizens of Bikini Bottom and is capable of turning anyone into a jerk. He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob a slice, but nothing seems to work on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very <b>big</b> <b>heart.</b> Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into jerks. After realizing that the element works only on other people in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil wind-up robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E

500|$|Priyanka Gandhi, while campaigned in Rae Bareli on 24 April, accused Narendra Modi of favouring {{businessmen}} by allocating land {{to their}} companies {{at very low}} prices and defended her husband Robert Vadra over the accusations of corruptions. While addressing a rally in Amethi on 5 May, Modi responded by criticising Priyanka for saying that BJP was involved in low level politics. He also added that former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi had humiliated a former chief minister of a state at an airport. Priyanka Gandhi called Modi's statement an insult to his [...] "martyr father" [...] and criticised BJP for involving in low level politics.

2500|$|Lucky and Luke start a {{slow process}} of {{reconciling}} when Luke kidnaps Lucky to an abandoned cabin and Lucky watches Luke distressfully dream of the rape while suffering from a delirious fever following a wolf trap accident.

Lucky's estrangement with his parents adds to his newfound open-mindedness about Nikolas, as Jackson told Soap Opera Magazine: [...] "Lucky's been {{trying to change the}} way he looks at things, to not become Luke. That's part of the process – not having the same relationship with Nikolas that Luke has with Stefan. (...) He's trying to find his own Spencer."

[...] In the same interview, Guza described the acceptance Lucky had come to have about his parents, recounting scenes where Lucky bonds with each.
