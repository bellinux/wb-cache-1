40|$|Background: Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a {{dermatosis}} {{characterized by}} thickened, hyperpigmented plaques, typically on the intertriginous surfaces and neck. Common in some populations, its prevalence depends on race. Clinicians should recognize AN; it heralds disorders ranging from endocrinologic disturbances to malignancy. In this review, {{we discuss the}} pathogenesis of AN and its clinical implications and management. Materials and Methods: We selected 30 patients for the study. Diagnosis of associated disorders was established by history, physical examination, body mass index (BMI), hormone measurements by radioimmunoassays of thyroidnfunction tests, free testosterone, 17 (OH) progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), cortisol, gonadotropins, prolactin, immunoreactive insulin, and C-peptide levels. Results and Discussion: In our study, the flexural involvement (flexures of groins, knees and elbows) <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in 40 % patients, lip involvement <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in 6. 6 % patients, and dorsal involvement <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in 3. 3 % patients each. Increased serum testosterone levels <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> in 13. 3 % patients and increased DHEAS levels <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> in 20 % patients. Regarding the types of AN, obesity induced AN or pseudo-AN <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> 70 % patients, syndromic AN <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in 23. 35 % patients and malignant AN <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in 6. 6 % patients. The commonest histopathological feature of patients with AN <b>was</b> hyperkeratosis, <b>seen</b> in 100 % patients, papillomatosis <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in 90 % patients, dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in 60 % patients, horn pseudocysts <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> in 30 % patients, and irregular acanthosis <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in 26. 6 % patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cicatrical {{alopecia}} {{occurs in}} otherwise healthy {{men and women}} of all ages and <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> worldwide Material and Methods: A study of 40 patients was conducted to study the clinical variants and histopathology of cicatricial alopecia. Results and Discussion: n our study, it <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> that maximum number of cases of cicatrical alopecia were of LPP (27. 5 %) followed by 25 % of DLE, 20 % patients had pseudopelade of Brocq, SLE <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in 5 % cases followed by Scleroderma, dermatomyositis, Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans, aplasia cutis, kerion, follicular mucinosis, pemphigus, dissecting cellulitis of scalp/ pyogenic folliculitis and acne keloidalis nuchae in 2. 5 % cases each. Regarding the morphology of lesions,epidermal atrophy <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in 90 % patients, erythema <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in 55 % cases, follicular pluging <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in 40 % patients, telangiectasias in 27. 5 % patients, diffuse scaling in 25 % patients and mottled hyperpigmentation <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in 20 % patients. In our study, commonest histopathological feature of alopecia <b>was</b> perifollicular fibrosis <b>seen</b> in 65 % patients, basal cell vacuolization <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in 52. 5 % patients,perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> in 50 % patients, epidermal atrophy seen in 35 % patients and hyperkeratosis <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in 20 % patients...|$|R
