500|$|Santiago Fouz-Hernández {{wrote in}} his book, Madonna's Drowned Worlds, that the Black woman who catches Madonna when she is falling through heaven in her dream, is a symbol for the divinity, as she helps Madonna {{throughout}} the video {{to come to the}} correct decision. Fouz-Hernández explained how the physical similarity between Madonna and woman indicated that it was actually Madonna's inner divinity which was rescuing her. When the singer accidentally cuts her hand on the dagger, it was described as receiving stigmata by scholar Robert McQueen Grant, who believed that the scene marked Madonna as having an important role to play in the narrative. This was evident when the crime scene is shown in detail, and an identification is established between Madonna and the victim. Freya Jarman-Ivens, coauthor with Fouz-Hernández, noted that the woman cries out for help when Madonna sings the line [...] "When you call my name, It's like a little prayer". However, Madonna could not do anything thus portraying failure of divinity to save. Jarman-Ivens also noted the look between the gang member and Madonna, which she thought was a complicity of [...] "White men rape/kill women, white men blame it on Black men; Women are raped/killed for being on the streets at night, <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> nevertheless thrown in jail." ...|$|E

500|$|Clarence13X {{developed}} novel teachings, assigning backronyms to familiar words. He {{stated that}} {{the letters of the}} word [...] "Allah" [...] stood for [...] "arm, leg, leg, arm, head", signifying the human body. This was said to prove that humanity held a divine nature. He named parts of the New York area after locations in the Middle East that are significant to Islam: Harlem was referred to as Mecca, and Brooklyn, Medina. Other disaffected NOI members, including some who served the Fruit of Islam, were soon drawn to his burgeoning group. Several people from the NOI who were unwilling to choose between loyalty to Elijah Muhammad and MalcolmX also joined; Clarence13X incorporated aspects of the theology taught by the feuding leaders. In the group's early years, some Five Percenters attended NOI events, and Clarence13X's theology had much in common with the teachings of the NOI, although there were notable differences. He taught his followers that he was an incarnation of God, and they each were gods. His followers were thus encouraged to look within themselves in their search for God. Clarence13X taught that there was an inherent greatness in those of African descent not found in Europeans and their descendants, echoing statements made by Elijah Muhammad. He did not enforce the NOI's strict moral rules: one way that the group appealed to potential converts was by allowing many practices condemned by the NOI, including gambling, alcohol consumption, and drug use. Clarence13X told his followers to avoid developing addictions but that drug use was not inherently wrong. He strictly forbade the consumption of pork, arguing that pigs were similar to animals that are not eaten in the United States, such as rats and dogs, and hence should not be consumed. Owing to their belief that <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> gods, the group allowed its members to make choices about clothing and most aspects of diet.|$|E
2500|$|It was 1920 in the {{southwest}} West Virginia coal fields, and, as the narrator recalls, [...] "things were tough." [...] In response to efforts by miners to organize into a labor union, the Stone Mountain Coal Company announces it will cut the pay miners receive, and will be importing replacement workers into town to replace those who join the union. The new workers are African Americans from Alabama and are coming in on the train, but the train is stopped outside town and the <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> told to get off. Derided as [...] "scabs", they are then attacked by the local miners, but manage {{to get back on}} the train and continue their journey.|$|E

[...] "This is 2016 and <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> now target practice for police,” he said. “The Bronx District Attorney's office is no better ... They are out to cover their tracks of lies, deceit and prejudice." [...] Moore's sister, in response, called him a [...] "menace to society ... should {{never be able to}} see the light of day again.” He was returned to Attica Correctional Facility, where he has been serving his assault sentence.|$|E

2500|$|A rumour later {{spread that}} in 1916, Garvey had called on his {{supporters}} to [...] "look to Africa" [...] for the crowning {{of a black}} king; this quote was never verified. Soumahoro noted that this statement was [...] "legendary". Rather, Garvey was critical of Haile Selassie for leaving Ethiopia {{at the time of}} the Italian Fascist occupation, describing the king as [...] "a great coward" [...] who rules a [...] "country where <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> chained and flogged." [...] Rastafari does not promote all of the views that Garvey espoused, but nevertheless shares many of the same perspectives, with many Rastas regarding Garvey as a prophet. According to Soumahoro, Rastafari [...] "emerged from the socio-political ferment inaugurated by Marcus Garvey", while for Cashmore, Garvey was the [...] "most important" [...] precursor of the Rastafari movement.|$|E

50|$|During {{the time}} Joseph Smith, {{founder of the}} Latter Day Saint Movement (1830-1844), was the leader, there were no {{official}} racial policies established by what {{is now known as}} the LDS Church. Black people were welcomed as members of the church and as evidence of the lack of official policy, in 1836, two <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> ordained priests: Elijah Abel and Walker Lewis. Before 1847 a handful of other <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> ordained to the priesthood. That same year, Abel {{went on to become a}} member of the Quorum of the Seventy and received a patriarchal blessing. Although there was no official policy, there is evidence that some <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> denied the priesthood during the Missouri period in order to appease slave owners in the area.|$|R

[...] Orpin here commenced to expound the Word, and {{to tell the story of}} the Cross, while the Hottentot listened with rapt attention, or asked questions which showed that he had indeed been thinking of these things since his last meeting with the trader, many years before. He was not very communicative, however, and when the two parted he declined to make any more satisfactory promise than that he would continue to [...] "tink." ...|$|E
6000|$|The merry {{voices of}} children, too, were heard, and their active little black bodies were seen, while {{they engaged in}} the play of savages-- though not {{necessarily}} in savage play. Some romped, ran after each other, caught each other, tickled each other, occasionally whacked each other--just as our own little ones do. Others played at games, of which the skipping-rope was a decided favourite among the girls, but the play {{of most of the}} older children consisted in imitating the serious work of their parents. The girls built little huts, hoed little gardens, made small pots of clay, pounded imaginary corn in miniature mortars, cooked it over ideal fires, and crammed it down the throats of imitation babies; while the boys performed deeds of chivalric daring with reed spears, small shields, and tiny bows and arrows, or amused themselves in making cattle-pens, and in sculpturing cows and crocodiles. Human nature, in short, was powerfully developed, without anything particular to suggest the idea of [...] "savage" [...] life, or to justify the opinion of Arabs and half-caste Portuguese that <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> all [...] "cattle." ...|$|E
60|$|Governors, we {{know very}} well, cannot with their own hands be {{continually}} receiving bribes,--for then they must have as many hands {{as one of the}} idols in an Indian temple, in order to receive all the bribes which a Governor-General may receive,--but they have them vicariously. As there are many offices, so he has had various officers for receiving and distributing his bribes; he has a great many, some white and some black agents. The white men are loose and licentious; they are apt to have resentments, and to be bold in revenging them. The <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> very secret and mysterious; they are not apt to have very quick resentments, they have not the same liberty and boldness of language which characterize Europeans; and they have fears, too, for themselves, which makes it more likely that they will conceal anything committed to them by Europeans. Therefore Mr. Hastings had his black agents, not one, two, three, but many, disseminated through the country: no two of them, hardly, appear to be in the secret of any one bribe. He has had likewise his white agents,--they were necessary,--a Mr. Larkins and a Mr. Croftes. Mr. Croftes was sub-treasurer, and Mr. Larkins accountant-general. These were the last persons of all others that should have {{had anything to do with}} bribes; yet these were some of his agents in bribery. There are few instances, in comparison of the whole number of bribes, but there are some, where two men are in the secret of the same bribe. Nay, it appears that there was one bribe divided into different payments at different times,--that one part was committed to one black secretary, another part to another black secretary. So that it is almost impossible to make up a complete body of all his bribery: you may find the scattered limbs, some here and others there; and while you are employed in picking them up, he may escape entirely in a prosecution for the whole.|$|E

50|$|Racial {{differences}} have historically stratified the men’s liberation movement and such divisions still remain problematic today. Some profeminist {{scholars argue that}} racism within American society has emasculated non-white men. For example, <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> perceived to lack control over their innate sexual aggression. Within this ideological framework <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> presented as hyper-sexual to an animalistic degree; they therefore represent beasts, not men. East Asian Americans have been emasculated in an opposite way: they have been portrayed as desexualized, unattractive, small, wimpy, intelligent, and devious (see: Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States).|$|E
