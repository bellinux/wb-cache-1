5|$|An insect {{uses its}} {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes. Most of this food is ingested {{in the form of}} macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins, polysaccharides, fats and nucleic acids. These macromolecules must <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion.|$|E
5|$|As on the White Pass trail, {{supplies}} {{needed to}} <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> down into smaller packages and carried in relay.

5|$|Fears then arose for the engine's future, the {{speculation}} being {{that it might}} remain in the US or even <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> up.

After its return to the UK via the Panama Canal in February 1973, McAlpine paid for the locomotive's restoration at Derby Works.|$|E

5|$|For 24-year-old Hanshin Tigers fan Masaya Shitababa, the 2003 celebration was a tragedy. He {{drowned in}} the canal, with all reports being {{that he had been}} shoved in by the revelers.

50|$|Glucose and {{galactose}} {{are called}} simple sugars, or monosaccharides.

As a result, lactose, sucrose and other compounds made from carbohydrates cannot be digested by individuals with glucose-galactose malabsorption.|$|R
