40|$|Abstract: Biomass <b>briquettes</b> are a biofuel {{substitute}} to {{coal and}} charcoal. <b>Briquettes</b> are mostly {{used in the}} developing world where cooking fuels are not as easily available. <b>Briquettes</b> are used to heat industrial boilers in order to produce electricity from steam. The <b>briquettes</b> are con-fired with coal in order to create the heat supplied to the boiler. People have been using biomass <b>briquettes</b> since before recorded history. Biomass <b>briquettes</b> are made from agriculture waste and are a replacement for fossils fuels such as oil or coal, and can be used to heat boiler in manufacturing plants. Biomass <b>briquettes</b> are a renewable source of energy and avoid adding fossils carbon to the atmosphere. The extrusion production technology of <b>briquettes</b> is the process of extrusion screw wastes (straw, sunflower husks, buckwheat, etc.) or finely shredded wood waste (sawdust) under high pressure. There is a tremendous scope to bring down the waste of convention energy sources to a considerable level through the development, propagation of non-convention <b>briquettes</b> technology i. e. <b>briquettes</b> machine, <b>briquettes</b> plant, biomass <b>briquettes</b> plant for production of agro residue <b>briquettes</b> to meet thermal energy requirement.

25|$|A {{charcoal}} <b>briquette,</b> or briquet is a {{block of}} flammable charcoal matter which is used as fuel to start and maintain a fire, mainly used for food preparation over an open fire or a barbecue. Charcoal briquettes are made by using a process which consists of compressing charcoal, typically made from sawdust and other wood by-products, with a binder and other additives. The binder is usually starch. Some charcoal briquettes may also include brown coal, mineral carbon, borax, sodium nitrate, limestone, raw sawdust, and other additives like paraffin or petroleum solvents to aid in ignition. The design of the charcoal <b>briquette</b> was invented and patented by Ellsworth B. A. Zwoyer in 1897.|$|E
