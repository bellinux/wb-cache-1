40|$|Abstract—The Automobile Braking System has {{a crucial}} role for safety of the {{passenger}} and riding quality of the vehicle. The <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> mainly depends on normal reaction on the wheel and the co-efficient of friction between the tire and the road surface. Whenever a vehicle is loaded, the normal reaction on the rear wheel is increased. Thus the amount of <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> required to halt the vehicle with minimum stopping distance, {{is based on the}} pillion load on the vehicle. In this work, in order to vary the <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> in two wheelers, the mechanical leverage which operates the master cylinder is varied based on the pillion load. Thus the amount of <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> developed between ground and tire is varied. This optimum <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> on the disc brake helps in attaining the minimum vehicle stopping distance. In addition to that, it also helps in preventing sliding. Thus the system results in reducing the stopping distance of the two wheelers and providing a better braking efficiency than the conventional <b>braking</b> system.

2500|$|Disc brakes are {{increasingly}} used on {{very large and}} heavy road vehicles, where previously large drum brakes were nearly universal. One {{reason is that the}} disc's lack of self-assist makes <b>brake</b> <b>force</b> much more predictable, so peak <b>brake</b> <b>force</b> can be raised without more risk of braking-induced steering or jackknife on articulated vehicles. Another is disc brakes fade less when hot, and in a heavy vehicle air and rolling drag and engine braking are small parts of total braking force, so brakes are used harder than on lighter vehicles, and drum brake fade can occur in a single stop. For these reasons, a heavy truck with disc brakes can stop in about 120% the distance of a passenger car, but with drums stopping takes about 150% the distance. In Europe, stopping distance regulations essentially require disc brakes for heavy vehicles. In the U.S., drums are allowed and are typically preferred for their lower purchase price, despite higher total lifetime cost and more frequent service intervals.|$|E

Firstly, the corresponding preferred controls subjected to vehicle <b>braking</b> <b>forces</b> and earthquake excitations, separately, are obtained by simulation analyses for seven control strategies. Then, a mixed control system is established to obtain the best control efficiency and reduce the energy consumption of MR dampers, based on the displacement responses and changing rate of accelerations.
