5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may <b>be</b> <b>advised</b> {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E
5|$|If {{permanent}} brachytherapy is used, {{low dose}} radioactive sources (seeds) {{are left in}} the body after treatment – the radiation levels are very low and decrease over time. In addition, the irradiation only affects tissues within a few millimeters of the radioactive sources (i.e. the tumour being treated). As a precaution, some people receiving permanent brachytherapy may <b>be</b> <b>advised</b> to not hold any small children or be too close to pregnant women {{for a short time}} after treatment. Radiation oncologists or nurses can provide specific instructions to patients and advise for how long they need to be careful.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945 an Interim Committee {{was created}} to advise and report on wartime and postwar {{policies}} {{regarding the use of}} nuclear energy. The Interim Committee in turn established a scientific panel consisting of Arthur Compton, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the Interim Committee the scientific panel offered its opinion not just on the likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its likely military and political impact. This included opinions on such sensitive issues as whether or not the Soviet Union should <b>be</b> <b>advised</b> of the weapon in advance of its use against Japan.|$|E
50|$|Negotiations and {{the search}} for {{international}} lenders is ongoing. Uganda and Tanzania <b>are</b> being <b>advised</b> by Standard Bank of South Africa, while Total SA <b>is</b> being <b>advised</b> by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. The London-based firm law firm Clifford Chance <b>is</b> <b>advising</b> Total SA on legal matters, while CNOOC <b>is</b> <b>advised</b> by the Imperial Bank of China.|$|R

50|$|Its use in {{pregnancy}} <b>is</b> <b>advised</b> against, although animal studies are reassuring {{in that they}} show minimal risk of birth defects; its use in the elderly or those with liver/kidney impairment <b>is</b> <b>advised</b> against, but if these groups of people must be treated a lower dose and caution is usually advised; its use in lactation <b>is</b> <b>advised</b> against as it is excreted in breast milk.|$|R
5|$|Russell replaces Mill's {{analysis}} with {{an examination of}} the issue from four perspectives: the perspective of the governor, the citizen, the innovator, and the philosopher. The rational governor is always threatened by revolutionary activities, and can always be expected to ban speech which calls for assassination. Yet the governor would <b>be</b> <b>advised</b> to allow freedom of speech to prevent and diminish discontent among the subjects, and has no reason to suppress ideas which are unrelated to his governance, for instance the Copernican doctrine of heliocentrism. Relatedly, the citizen mainly understands free speech {{as an extension of the}} right to do peaceably that which could only otherwise be done through violence (Russell 1938:179–182).|$|E
5|$|In the 15th century, York Castle, {{along with}} Nottingham Castle, was {{considered}} a key security asset {{in the north of}} England, but investment even in these castles diminished. Repairs to York Castle grew infrequent from 1400 onwards, and it fell into increasing disrepair. Richard III recognised the issue and in 1483 had some of the most decrepit structures removed, but he died at the battle of Bosworth before replacement work could commence. By the reign of Henry VIII, the antiquary John Leland reported that the castle was in considerable disrepair; nonetheless the water defences remained intact, unlike those of many other castles of the period. As a result of the deterioration, Henry had to <b>be</b> <b>advised</b> that the king's councillors no longer had any official residence in which to stay and work when they were in York. The castle mint was shut down after the death of Edward VI in 1553, and the castle mills were given to a local charitable hospital in 1464. The hospital was then closed during the Reformation, and the mills passed into private ownership once again.|$|E

Calcium supplements may also <b>be</b> <b>advised,</b> as may Vitamin D. When medication is used, it may include bisphosphonates, Strontium ranelate, and hormone replacement therapy.|$|E
25|$|Hematologic effects, such as neutropenia, {{agranulocytosis}} {{and other}} blood dyscrasias, have occurred during therapy with ACE inhibitors, especially {{in patients with}} additional risk factors (see Warnings). Patients should <b>be</b> <b>advised</b> to report symptoms such as sore throat or fever to their physician.|$|E

50|$|Each of {{the health}} risk {{categories}} has advice with it. At the low and moderate levels the public <b>are</b> <b>advised</b> that they can continue normal activities. For the high category, children, the elderly and people with heart or respiratory illnesses <b>are</b> <b>advising</b> to reduce outdoor physical exertion. Above this (very high or serious) the general public <b>are</b> also <b>advised</b> to reduce or avoid outdoor physical exertion.|$|R
50|$|The main {{aim of the}} Pojulu {{marriage}} is to produce children. It {{is for this reason}} that the mothers of the girls <b>are</b> <b>advised</b> to <b>be</b> strict on their girls' behaviors and movement.

25|$|Indian amateur radio {{operators}} number approximately 20,000. Amateur radio clubs {{across the}} country offer training courses for the Amateur Station Operator's Certificate. People interested in the hobby would <b>be</b> <b>advised</b> {{to get in touch}} with a local radio club or a local amateur radio operator who can direct them to a club that organises training programmes.|$|E
25|$|Sunscreen is {{effective}} and thus recommended to prevent melanoma and squamous-cell carcinoma. There {{is little evidence}} that it {{is effective}} in preventing basal-cell carcinoma. Other advice to reduce rates of skin cancer includes avoiding sunburning, wearing protective clothing, sunglasses and hats, and attempting to avoid sun exposure or periods of peak exposure. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that people between 9 and 25 years of age <b>be</b> <b>advised</b> to avoid ultraviolet light.|$|E
25|$|I-131 will be {{eliminated}} from the body {{over the next several}} weeks after it is given. The majority of I-131 will {{be eliminated}} from the human body in 3–5 days, through natural decay, and through excretion in sweat and urine. Smaller amounts will continue to be released over the next several weeks, as the body processes thyroid hormones created with the I-131. For this reason, it is advised to regularly clean toilets, sinks, bed sheets and clothing used by the person who received the treatment. Patients may also <b>be</b> <b>advised</b> to wear slippers or socks at all times, and avoid prolonged close contact with others. This minimizes accidental exposure by family members, especially children. Use of a decontaminant specially made for radioactive iodine removal may <b>be</b> <b>advised.</b> The use of chlorine bleach solutions, or cleaners that contain chlorine bleach for cleanup, are not advised, since radioactive elemental iodine gas may be released. Airborne I-131 may cause a greater risk of second-hand exposure, spreading contamination over a wide area. Patient is advised if possible to stay in a room with a bathroom connected to it to limit unintended exposure to family members.|$|E

25|$|A Mediterranean diet {{lowers the}} risk of cancer as does the {{stopping}} of smoking. There is tentative evidence that treating H. pylori decreases the future risk. If cancer is treated early, many cases can be cured. Treatments may include some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. If treated late, palliative care may <b>be</b> <b>advised.</b> Outcomes are often poor with a less than 10% five-year survival rate globally. This is largely because most people with the condition present with advanced disease.|$|E
25|$|Cumberland's unpopularity, {{which had}} {{steadily}} increased since Culloden, interfered greatly with {{his success in}} politics, and when {{the death of the}} Prince of Wales brought the latter's son, a minor, next in succession to the throne, the Duke was not able to secure for himself the contingent regency. As a compromise, the regency was vested in the Dowager Princess of Wales, who considered him an enemy, but her powers were curtailed and she was to <b>be</b> <b>advised</b> by a committee of twelve men, headed by Cumberland.|$|E
25|$|The Paris Peace Accords of 1973 {{brought an}} end to the United States {{advisory}} capacity in South Vietnam.
