5|$|One-day {{track and}} field {{meetings}} form {{the most common and}} seasonal aspect of the sport – they are the most <b>basic</b> <b>level</b> of {{track and field}} competition. Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club, or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, athletes are selected to represent their club or institution. In the case of privately run or independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation-only basis.|$|E
5|$|During {{the concept}} phase {{there were four}} people working on the Hitman Go. Initial prototypes were built on paper using printed out characters. The project was pitched and greenlit for {{production}} in mid 2013. Daniel Lutz served as creative director, and the team size peaked at eleven people throughout {{the remainder of the}} game's development. The studio looked at several different engines for building the game, but opted with Unity early on as it had a low barrier of entry, provided support for the main mobile platforms, and some members of the development team had previous experience creating projects in the game engine. An initial working prototype and a <b>basic</b> <b>level</b> editor were developed in a few days and after two weeks the first version of the game was presented to the remainder of the studio.|$|E
5|$|Education was {{provided}} for the children, but workhouse teachers were a particular problem. Poorly paid, without any formal training, and facing large classes of unruly children {{with little or no}} interest in their lessons, few stayed in the job {{for more than a few}} months. In an effort to force workhouses to offer at least a <b>basic</b> <b>level</b> of education, legislation was passed in 1845 requiring that all pauper apprentices should be able to read and sign their own indenture papers. A training college for workhouse teachers was set up at Kneller Hall in Twickenham during the 1840s, but it closed in the following decade.|$|E

5|$|From a user's perspective, an HDMI display can {{be driven}} by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an {{overlapping}} minimum set of allowed resolutions and framebuffer formats to ensure a <b>basic</b> <b>level</b> of interoperability. In the reverse case a DVI-D monitor {{would have the same}} level of basic interoperability unless there are content protection issues with High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space YCbCr which is not possible in DVI, instead of RGB. An HDMI source such as a Blu-ray player may demand HDCP-compliance of the display, and refuse to output HDCP-protected content to a non-compliant display. A further complication {{is that there is a}} small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.|$|E
5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a <b>basic</b> <b>level,</b> they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by {{the problem of how}} to provide better access to ever enlarging collections of digital images. The paper opens by examining the concept of place in geographic theory and suggests how it might provide a way of providing keywords suitable for indexing of images. The paper then focuses on the specific challenge of how places are described in natural language, drawing on previous research from the literature that has looked at eliciting geographical concepts related to so-called <b>basic</b> <b>levels.</b> The authors describe their own approach to eliciting such terms. This employs techniques to mine a database of descriptions of images that document the geography of the United Kingdom and compares the results with those found in the literature. The most four most frequent <b>basic</b> <b>levels</b> encountered in the database, based on fifty possible terms derived from the literature, were road, hill, river and village. In co-occurrence experiments terms describing the elements and qualities of <b>basic</b> <b>levels</b> showed a qualitative accordance with expectations for example, terms describing element of beaches included shingle and sand and, those for beach qualities included being soft and deserted...|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} study aimed {{to investigate the}} effect of extensive reading on the pronunciation ability of EFL learners at <b>basic</b> <b>levels.</b> The proposed hypothesis predicted {{that the use of}} an extensive reading program, such as Uninterrupted Sustained Silent Reading (USSR), Drop Everything and Read (DEAR), or the Book Flood Approach, while nurturing a lifelong reading habit, leads to fossilization of incorrect pronunciations at <b>basic</b> <b>levels.</b> To this end, 100 EFL students attending English language courses at Azad University of Kermanshah were selected using convenient sampling. Pretests were administered before the application of experimental and control treatments. The equivalence of the groups was provided by random assignment of subjects to experimental and control treatments. Also a post test was administered after the treatment. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used for data analyses. The mean test scores of both groups was subjected to the test of statistical significance which was a t-test. Based on the use of descriptive and inferential statistics, it was concluded that the use of extensive reading programs leads to the fossilization of incorrect pronunciations at <b>basic</b> <b>levels</b> among EFL learners. </p...|$|R
