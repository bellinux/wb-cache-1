5|$|The trihalides adopt a planar {{trigonal}} structure. These compounds are Lewis {{acids in}} that they readily form adducts with electron-pair donors, which are called Lewis bases. For example, fluoride (F−) and <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> (BF3) combined to give the tetrafluoroborate anion, BF4−. <b>Boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> {{is used in the}} petrochemical industry as a catalyst. The halides react with water to form boric acid.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} acid {{catalyst}} is very important. Bronsted acids such as HCl, H2SO4, polyphosphoric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid {{have been used}} successfully. Lewis acids such as <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride,</b> zinc chloride, iron(III) chloride, and aluminium chloride are also useful catalysts.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its high}} neutron cross-section, boron-10 {{is often used to}} control fission in nuclear {{reactors}} as a neutron-capturing substance. Several industrial-scale enrichment processes have been developed; however, only the fractionated vacuum distillation of the dimethyl ether adduct of <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> (DME-BF3) and column chromatography of borates are being used.|$|E
5|$|Low-pressure {{deposition}} of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, {{the major problem}} is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> is used for c-BN. Ion beam deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition, reactive sputtering, and other physical vapor deposition methods are used as well.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> is planar and {{possesses}} {{an incomplete}} octet. It {{functions as a}} Lewis acid and combines with Lewis bases like ammonia to form adducts. Carbon tetrafluoride is tetrahedral and inert; its group analogues, silicon and germanium tetrafluoride, are also tetrahedral but behave as Lewis acids. The pnictogens form trifluorides that increase in reactivity and basicity with higher molecular weight, although nitrogen trifluoride resists hydrolysis and is not basic. The pentafluorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are more reactive than their respective trifluorides, with antimony pentafluoride the strongest neutral Lewis acid known.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, {{when she}} was {{finishing}} writing up her thesis, she was the youngest and last of Mulliken's pre-war students, and was working alone because all her fellow students had become involved with war work. She met Herbert Anderson, who was working for Enrico Fermi. The two would go swimming together in Lake Michigan every afternoon at 5 pm. Anderson discovered that Woods was adept with vacuum technology from her research, {{and as soon as}} her PhD was finished, he hired her to work with the <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> detectors used to measure neutron flux.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} resumed at 14:00. Weil {{worked the}} final control rod while Fermi carefully monitored the neutron activity. Fermi {{announced that the}} pile had gone critical (reached a self-sustaining reaction) at 15:25. Fermi switched the scale on the recorder to accommodate the rapidly increasing electrical current from the <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> detector. He wanted to test the control circuits, but after 28 minutes, the alarm bells went off to notify everyone that the neutron flux had passed the preset safety level, and he ordered Zinn to release the zip. The reaction rapidly halted. The pile had run for about 4.5 minutes at about 0.5 watts. Wigner opened a bottle of Chianti, which they drank from paper cups.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> and trichloride {{are used}} as {{catalysts}} in organic synthesis and electronics; the tribromide {{is used in the}} manufacture of diborane. Non-toxic boron ligands could replace toxic phosphorus ligands in some transition metal catalysts. Silica sulfuric acid (SiO2OSO3H) is used in organic reactions. Germanium dioxide is sometimes used as a catalyst in the production of PET plastic for containers; cheaper antimony compounds, such as the trioxide or triacetate, are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about antimony contamination of food and drinks. Arsenic trioxide has been used in the production of natural gas, to boost the removal of carbon dioxide, as have selenous acid and tellurous acid. Selenium acts as a catalyst in some microorganisms. Tellurium, and its dioxide and tetrachloride, are strong catalysts for air oxidation of carbon above 500°C. Graphite oxide {{can be used as a}} catalyst in the synthesis of imines and their derivatives. Activated carbon and alumina have been used as catalysts for the removal of sulfur contaminants from natural gas. Titanium doped aluminium has been identified as a substitute for expensive noble metal catalysts used in the production of industrial chemicals.|$|E
25|$|The Mukaiyama aldol {{reaction}} is the nucleophilic addition of silyl enol ethers to aldehydes catalyzed by a Lewis acid such as <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> (as <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> etherate) or titanium tetrachloride. The Mukaiyama aldol reaction {{does not follow}} the Zimmerman-Traxler model. Carreira has described particularly useful asymmetric methodology with silyl ketene acetals, noteworthy for its high levels of enantioselectivity and wide substrate scope.|$|E
25|$|When phenol is {{reacted with}} {{diazomethane}} {{in the presence}} of <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> (BF3), anisole is obtained as the main product and nitrogen gas as a byproduct.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} type {{requires a}} Lewis acid catalyst such as <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride.</b> In this way 2-phenyl-N-tosylaziridine reacts with alkynes, nitriles, ketones and alkenes. Certain 1,4-dipoles form from azetidines.|$|E
25|$|Reactions of {{ethylene}} oxide with fatty alcohols proceed {{in the presence}} of sodium metal, sodium hydroxide or <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> and are used for the synthesis of surfactants.|$|E
25|$|A second Mitsunobu {{reaction}} then {{forms the}} aziridine 14 available for ring-opening reaction with 3-pentanol catalyzed by <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> to ether 15. In {{the final step}} the BOC group is removed (HCl) and phosphoric acid added to objective 16.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} of the Geiger tube is used to measure neutrons, where the gas used is <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> or helium-3 and a plastic moderator is used to slow the neutrons. This creates an alpha particle inside the detector and thus neutrons can be counted.|$|E
25|$|In the {{synthesis}} of apremilast, compound 3 in scheme 5 is produced in a 41% yield from compound 2 treated with lithium hexamethyldisilazide, in mixture with lithium dimethylsulfone and <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> etherate. The resolution of compound 3 was accomplished by treating it with N-acetyl-L-leucine yielding 3S. The final step then uses condensation of 3-N-acetylaminophthalic anhydride with 3S to afford apremilast (1S) in 75% yield.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{point for}} the {{synthesis}} of ring A was methoxydimethylindol 3 synthesised by condensation of the Schiff base from m-anisidine 1 and acetoin 2. Reaction with the Grignard reagent of propargyl iodide 4 give the propargyl indolenine 5 and ring-closure to 7 was brought about by <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> and mercuric oxide in methanol through intermediate 6 (electrophilic addition) with the two methyl groups forced into a cis-relationship.|$|E
25|$|Research in {{the area}} of a solid {{catalyst}} for alkylation has been ongoing for many years. Numerous patents exist for different catalysts, catalyst supports, and processes. Lewis acids will catalyze the alkylation reaction (alkylation of isobutane with olefins was discovered using aluminum chloride promoted with HCl). Several of the current preferred solid catalysts use a salt of HF: either <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> (BF3) or antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).|$|E
25|$|Type-III binary {{compounds}} are covalently bonded. Covalent bonding occurs between nonmetal elements. Covalently-bonded compounds {{are also}} known as molecules. In the compound, the first element is named first and with its full elemental name. The second element is named {{as if it were}} an anion (root name of the element + -ide suffix). Then, prefixes are used to indicate the numbers of each atom present: these prefixes are mono- (one), di- (two), tri- (three), tetra- (four), penta- (five), hexa- (six), hepta- (seven), octa- (eight), nona- (nine), and deca- (ten). The prefix mono- is never used with the first element. Thus, NCl3 is called nitrogen trichloride, P2O5 is called diphosphorus pentoxide (the a of the penta- prefix is dropped before the vowel for easier pronunciation), and BF3 is called <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lewis {{later wrote}} in [...] "To {{restrict}} {{the group of}} acids to those substances that contain hydrogen interferes as seriously with the systematic understanding of chemistry as would the restriction of the term oxidizing agent to substances containing oxygen." [...] In Lewis theory an acid, A, and a base, B:, form an adduct, AB, in which the electron pair is used to form a dative covalent bond between A and B. This is illustrated {{with the formation of}} the adduct H3N−BF3 from ammonia and <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride,</b> a reaction that cannot occur in aqueous solution because <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> reacts violently with water in a hydrolysis reaction.|$|E
500|$|Fermi {{designed}} a new pile, {{which would be}} spherical to maximize k, which was predicted to be around 1.04, thereby achieving criticality. Leona Woods was detailed to build <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> neutron detectors {{as soon as she}} completed her doctoral thesis. She also helped Anderson locate the large number of [...] timbers required at lumber yards in Chicago's south side. Shipments of high-purity graphite arrived, mainly from National Carbon, and high-purity uranium dioxide from Mallinckrodt in St Louis, which was now producing [...] a month. Metallic uranium also began arriving in larger quantities, the product of newly developed techniques.|$|E
500|$|About {{two layers}} were laid per shift. Woods' <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> neutron counter was {{inserted}} at the 15th layer. Thereafter, readings were {{taken at the}} end of each shift. Fermi divided the square of the radius of the pile by the intensity of the radioactivity to obtain a metric that counted down to one as the pile approached criticality. At the 15th layer, it was 390; at the 19th it was 320; at the 25th it was 270 and by the 36th it was only 149. The original design was for a spherical pile, but as work proceeded, it became clear that this would not be necessary. The new graphite was purer, and [...] of very pure metallic uranium began to arrive from the Ames Project at Iowa State University, where a team under Frank Spedding had developed a new process to produce uranium metal. Westinghouse Lamp Plant supplied , which it produced in a rush with a makeshift process.|$|E
500|$|The next day, 2 December 1942, {{everybody}} assembled for the experiment. There were 49 scientists present. Although {{most of the}} S-1 Executive Committee was in Chicago, only Crawford Greenewalt was present, at Compton's invitation. Other dignitaries present included Szilard, Wigner and Spedding. Fermi, Compton, Anderson and Zinn {{gathered around}} the controls on the balcony, which was originally intended as a viewing platform. Samuel Allison stood ready with a bucket of concentrated cadmium nitride, which he was to throw over the pile {{in the event of}} an emergency. The startup began at 09:54. Walter Zinn removed the zip, the emergency control rod, and secured it. Norman Hilberry stood ready with an axe to cut the scram line, which would allow the zip to fall under the influence of gravity. While Leona Woods called out the count from the <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> detector in a loud voice, George Weil, the only one on the floor, withdrew all but one of the control rods. At 10:37 Fermi ordered Weil to remove all but [...] of the last control rod. Weil withdrew it [...] at a time, with measurements being taken at each step.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{laboratory}} methods {{start from}} boron trichloride with lithium aluminium hydride or from <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> ether solution with sodium borohydride. Both methods result {{in as much}} as 30% yield: ...|$|E
2500|$|For example, <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride,</b> BF3 is {{a typical}} Lewis acid. It can accept a pair of {{electrons}} as it has a vacancy in its octet. The fluoride ion has a full octet and can donate a pair of electrons. Thus ...|$|E
2500|$|Ethers {{serve as}} Lewis bases and Bronsted bases. Strong acids protonate the oxygen to give [...] "onium ions". For instance, diethyl ether forms a complex with <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride,</b> i.e. diethyl etherate (BF3·OEt2). Ethers also {{coordinate}} to the Mg(II) center in Grignard reagents.|$|E
2500|$|... is {{a typical}} Lewis acid, Lewis base reaction. All {{compounds}} of group 13 elements with a formula AX3 can behave as Lewis acids. Similarly, compounds of group 15 elements with a formula DY3, such as amines, NR3, and phosphines, PR3, can behave as Lewis bases. Adducts between them have the formula X3A←DY3 with a dative covalent bond, shown symbolically as ←, between the atoms A (acceptor) and D (donor). Compounds of group 16 with a formula DX2 may also act as Lewis bases; in this way, a compound like an ether, R2O, or a thioether, R2S, {{can act as a}} Lewis base. The Lewis definition is not limited to these examples. For instance, carbon monoxide acts as a Lewis base when it forms an adduct with <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride,</b> of formula F3B←CO ...|$|E
2500|$|Pyridine (1) {{is reduced}} with sodium {{borohydride}} in presence of benzyl chloroformate to the Cbz protected dihydropyridine 2. The asymmetric Diels-Alder reaction with acrolein 3 {{is carried out}} with the McMillan catalyst to the aldehyde 4 as the endo isomer which is oxidized to the carboxylic acid 5 with sodium chlorite, monopotassium phosphate and 2-methyl-2-butene. Addition of bromine gives halolactonization product 6 and after replacement of the Cbz protective group by a BOC protective group in 7 (hydrogenolysis {{in the presence of}} di-tert-butyl dicarbonate) a carbonyl group is introduced in intermediate 8 [...] by catalytic ruthenium(IV) oxide and sacrificial catalyst sodium periodate. Addition of ammonia cleaves the ester group to form amide 9 the alcohol group of which is mesylated to compound 10. [...] In the next step iodobenzene diacetate is added, converting the amide in a Hofmann rearrangement to the allyl carbamate 12 after capturing the intermediate isocyanate with allyl alcohol 11. On addition of sodium ethoxide in ethanol three reactions take place simultaneously: cleavage of the amide to form new an ethyl ester group, displacement of the mesyl group by newly formed BOC protected amine to an aziridine group and an elimination reaction forming the alkene group in 13 with liberation of HBr. In the final two steps the aziridine ring is opened by 3-pentanol 14 and <b>boron</b> <b>trifluoride</b> to aminoether 15 with the BOC group replaced by an acyl group and on removal of the other amine protecting group (Pd/C, Ph3P, and 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid in ethanol) and addition of phosphoric acid oseltamivir 16 is obtained.|$|E
