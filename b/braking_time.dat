40|$|Antilock {{braking systems}} use slip to control braking, {{for which the}} {{velocity}} {{of the car and}} wheel speeds of the wheels are required. The wheel speeds can be measured directly but the velocity of the vehicle is difficult to measure. Although the wheel speed can be used to calculate the linear velocity of the vehicle using the tire characteristic function, it depends upon various environmental and time varying parameters. The dominant factor in the characteristic function is the road friction coefficient. Due to the difficulties in proper estimation of the road friction, most systems calculate the optimal values offline and apply them at different speeds using switching functions. By using the tire model and the optimal friction coefficients, the velocity of the vehicle is estimated and used for calculating the optimal braking force, resulting in inappropriate control of braking creating longer braking distances. In the method proposed in this paper, an estimator will be used to estimate the velocity, which is proved to be more accurate than calculated from the wheel speeds. The estimated velocity and the pitch angle will be used to schedule the braking forces {{in order to reduce the}} <b>braking</b> <b>time.</b> The <b>braking</b> <b>time</b> of the proposed system lies between the ideal <b>braking</b> <b>time</b> and the conventional reference wheel speed related <b>braking</b> <b>time,</b> indicating an improvement in reducing the braking distance...|$|E

In two experiments, participants drove a simulated vehicle equipped with a forward collision avoidance system. Auditory, vibrotactile, and multimodal warnings were presented when the time to collision was shorter than five seconds. The effects of these warnings were investigated with participants performing a concurrent cell phone conversation (Exp. 1) or driving in high-density traffic (Exp. 2). <b>Braking</b> <b>times</b> and subjective workload were measured.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to understand how the athlete produces acceleration during the first steps of sprint running. One athlete performed four starts from starting blocks over a series of four force plates. Horizontal impulse (which directly relates to the acceleration of the athlete) gradually decreased after leaving the blocks, while this decrease was transferred to a gradual increase in vertical force production to support the small but required vertical movement of CM in order to increase flight time (to gain longer steps). It also seems that the body can compensate for some technical mistakes during the performance, as the results revealed that an extended <b>braking</b> <b>time</b> in one step yielded a reduced <b>braking</b> <b>time</b> in the next step. This implied that the increased time in the contact was used to get other body parts into more favourable positions for the next step.

In response to this, a great deal of ergonomics research effort has been directed towards the analysis of <b>brake</b> reaction <b>times.</b> However, the engineering solution has been to develop advanced systems for longitudinal control, which it is argued will mitigate the problem of rear-end collisions.

40|$|Time and the {{stopping}} {{distance of the}} electric drive with frequent starting-and-braking modes that contain embedded asynchronous motor with a recessed combined braking device depend on the moment of an electromagnet disinhibition. At the same time other important criteria are taken into the account, i. e. wear resistance of the brake device and the smoothness of the deceleration of the electric drive. In general such an asynchronous motor contains asynchronous engine with squirrel-cage rotor, electromechanical normally-closed brake, electromagnetical slip clutch and control circuit. The mechanical characteristics of the deceleration of asynchronous motor with recessed combined brake device at different moments of an electromagnet disinhibition are presented.  The mathematical model is featured and the transients in such a motor are presented.  Formation models for computer research were {{carried out in the}} Fortran 2008 programming language. Calculation of the system of differential equations was fulfilled by the Runge – Kutta method.
