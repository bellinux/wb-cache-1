50|$|Stretch and folds or degassing: When {{the dough}} reaches a {{specified}} size or scheduled {{time it is}} removed from the bowl and stretched and folded on a flour-dusted surface for the purposes of degassing the bubbles that have formed as well as stretching and aligning the gluten, then it is returned to the bowl for continued <b>bulk</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Prior to folding, the dough surfaces that are folded together should be brushed to remove excess dry flour. This is also called knock back or punch down, and may occur in an oiled bowl followed by a few folds, then flipped over so the seam side is down. This stretching and folding develops the gluten and equalizes the dough temperature. Long bulk fermentations may have as many as 4 to 5 folding sessions. Some schedules begin degassing at half the total fermentation time, while others degas once just before the peak begins to fall. A fermentation ratio is described as the time the dough takes from leaving the mixer to just before the peak begins to fall — when degassing occurs — relative to the remaining <b>bulk</b> <b>fermentation</b> time afterwards. Folding or knock back may also be omitted: after sufficient <b>bulk</b> <b>fermentation</b> time, the dough may go straight to make-up.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of <b>bulk</b> starter <b>fermentation</b> strategy for {{production of a}} cost-effective and GRAS source of β-galactosidase from a starter culture strain Lactobacillus bulgaricus was investigated. Three different media were selected and the strain, L. bulgaricus DSM 20081 was cultivated in these media under pH-controlled condition (pH = 5. 6) at 43 °C. The media were: bulk starter medium based on skim milk + whey, bulk starter medium based on whey, and skim milk. Growth and β-lactic acid production parameters were estimated from experimental data with the Garcia and Luedeking-Piret models, respectively. β-galactosidase production kinetics was also simulated using models based on biomass concentration and lactic acid production. Growth in the bulk starter medium based on skim milk + whey resulted in {{a higher rate of}} lactic acid production (7. 35 ± 0. 23   mg lactic acid ml - 1 media h - 1) and β-galactosidase activity (800. 1 ± 0. 7 nmol ONP ml - 1 media) compared to the other two media (P < 0. 01). Simulation of β- galactosidase production based on rate of lactic acid production resulted in very good agreement with experimental data for all three tested media. The results revealed the {{potential of}} <b>bulk</b> starter <b>fermentation</b> strategy and skim milk + whey based medium for in-house and relatively low cost production of food-grade β-galactosidase by dairy plants. </p...|$|R
25|$|Dietary fibers {{have three}} primary mechanisms: <b>bulking,</b> {{viscosity}} and <b>fermentation.</b> Different fibers have different effects, {{suggesting that a}} variety of dietary fibers contribute to overall health. Some fibers contribute through one primary mechanism. For instance, cellulose and wheat bran provide excellent bulking effects, but are minimally fermented. Alternatively, many dietary fibers can contribute to health through more than one of these mechanisms. For instance, psyllium provides bulking as well as viscosity.|$|R

30|$|Mariano et al. [74], Secuianu et al. [75] and Ezeji [3] {{reported}} some of {{the most}} commonly used techniques for continuous recovery of butanol from the fermentation broth, namely adsorption, gas stripping, ionic liquids, liquid-liquid extraction, pervaporation, aqueous two-phase separation, supercritical extraction, and flash fermentation. Adsorption should allow separation of butanol from the <b>bulk</b> aqueous <b>fermentation</b> broth. Hydrophobic adsorbents potentially show high selectivity for butanol over water [5]. In adsorption, alcohol is preferentially transferred from the feed liquid to a solid adsorbent material [16]. Dhamole et al. [76] used a non-ionic surfactant to decrease butanol toxicity and its separation from the non-ionic surfactant micelle aqueous solution by cloud point extraction. Thus, the fermentation is not inhibited and butanol concentration is increased in the micelles.|$|R
25|$|Fiber {{is defined}} by its {{physiological}} impact, with many heterogenous types of fibers. Some fibers may primarily impact one of these benefits (i.e., cellulose increases fecal bulking and prevents constipation), but many fibers impact {{more than one of}} these benefits (i.e., resistant starch increases <b>bulking,</b> increases colonic <b>fermentation,</b> positively modulates colonic microflora and increases satiety and insulin sensitivity).

50|$|Retarding {{may occur}} {{at any time}} during {{fermentation}} and is accomplished by placing the dough into a dough retarder, refrigerator, or other cold environment to slow the activity of the yeast. The retarding stage is often used in sourdough bread recipes to allow the bread to develop its characteristic flavor. A cold fermentation stage is sometimes used to develop flavor in other artisan breads, with a part of the dough ("pre-ferment") before the final mixing, with the entire dough during <b>bulk</b> <b>fermentation,</b> or in the final fermentation stages after shaping.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} making yeast-leavened bread {{involves}} a series of alternating work and rest periods. Work periods occur when the dough is manipulated by the baker. Some work periods are called mixing, kneading, and folding, as well as division, shaping, and panning. Work periods are typically followed by rest periods, these occur when dough is allowed to sit undisturbed. Particular rest periods include, {{but are not limited}} to, autolyse, <b>bulk</b> <b>fermentation</b> and proofing. Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked.|$|E

Coagulase positive strains tended to clump when grown in tryptose serum broth. Tellurite glycine agar plates were not entirely reliable for the selection of coagulase positive strains. Fibrinogen-tellurite-glycine plates were very useful for the isolation of staphylococci from milk in the presence of other microorganisms and for the simultaneous identification of coagulase positive strains. Plate coagulase tests utilizing fibrinogen tellurite glycine agar corresponded almost perfectly with conventional tube tests. Fibrinolytic strains were not uncommon and were found also among beta hemolysin producing coagulase positive strains...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBacteria possess surface properties, {{related to}} their charge, {{hydrophobicity}} and Lewis acid/base characteristics, {{that are involved in}} the attachment processes of microorganisms to surfaces. <b>Fermentation</b> <b>bulks</b> and food matrixes are complex heterogeneous media containing various components with different physicochemical characteristics. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether (i) bacteria present in a food matrix, interacted physicochemically at their surface level with the other constituents and (ii) the diversity of bacterial surface properties could result in a diversity of microbial adhesion to components and thus in a diversity of tolerance to toxic compounds. The surface properties of 20 lactic acid bacteria were characterized by the MATS method showing their relatively hydrophilic and various basic characteristics. The results obtained from a set of representative strains showed that (i) the strains with higher affinity for apolar solvents adsorbed more to lipids and hydrophobic compounds, (ii) the more the strains adsorbed to a toxic solvent, the less they were tolerant to this solvent. A diversity of bacterial surface properties was observed for the strains in the same species showing the importance of choosing bacteria according to their surface properties in function of technological objectives...|$|R
40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} of the {{gastrointestinal tract}} {{is crucial for}} optimal food processing and nutrient balance in many vertebrate species. For mammalian herbivores, gut plasticity is typically correlated with the fiber content of forage; however, we show here that other factors such as ingesta particle size may effect profound phenotypic plasticity of the fermentative hind-gut in a medium-sized (10 -kg body mass) marsupial herbivore, the red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus). When dietary fiber contents were comparable, red-necked wallabies that were fed a finely ground, pelleted hay for 60 - 72 d had hindguts that were some 28 % heavier (empty wet mass) than those fed unchopped hay. The hindguts of pellet-fed wallabies contained more wet ingesta, which was also of a finer particle size, than those fed hay, indicating some separation of large- and small-particle fermentation between the foregut and the hindgut, respectively. Such a digestive strategy would benefit animals by allowing fermentation {{of a range of}} ingesta particle sizes that are expected for free-ranging animals faced with a spectrum of diet types and qualities. The heavier hindgut of pellet-fed wallabies was correlated with increased concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the fermentative hindgut (cecum and proximal colon) and particularly with increases in the molar proportions of n-butyric acid. The mechanisms facilitating gut plasticity in herbivorous mammals are uncertain, but we suggest that manipulating ingesta particle size rather than dietary fiber could provide a useful tool for evaluating causal explanations. In particular, altering ingesta particle size could help to distinguish possible direct processes (e. g., the favoring of smaller intestinal microbes and production of specific SCFAs) from indirect affects of feed structure (e. g., muscular hypertrophy to compensate for increased intakes and digesta <b>bulk</b> or the <b>fermentation</b> of mucus secreted to promote the flow of viscous, fine-particle material) ...|$|R
50|$|A dough proofer is {{a warming}} chamber used in baking that {{encourages}} fermentation of dough by yeast through warm temperatures and controlled humidity. It is also called a proofing box, proofing oven or proofing cabinet. The warm temperatures increase {{the activity of}} the yeast, resulting in increased carbon dioxide production and a higher, faster rise. Dough is typically allowed to rise in the proofer before baking, but can also be used for the first rise, or <b>bulk</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Desired proofer temperatures can range from around 70F / 21C up to about 115F / 46C (cooler temperatures are achieved in a dough retarder, see below). Commercial bakers typically use large, temperature- and humidity-controlled proofers, whereas home bakers employ a variety of methods to create a warm, humid environment for dough rising. Examples include a home oven with a bowl of water and the pilot light on, a box with a bowl of hot water in it (the water is replaced periodically to maintain warmth), or a counter top proofer (an electric appliance) designed for home use.|$|E
40|$|Resistant starch has {{potential}} health benefits but the factors affecting its formation in bread and baked products {{are not well}} studied.

The effects of each the factor were assessed using a full factorial design. The impact on final starch content of traditional sourdough fermentation of wholemeal rye bread, as well as the <b>bulk</b> <b>fermentation</b> process of wheat and wheat/oat blends of wholemeal bread, was also assessed by enzyme assay. Palm oil content was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the formation of resistant starch in all of the breads while fermentation time and temperature had no significant impact.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} {{different}} quantities of added amylase to white wheat flours characterized with different activities of naturally existing amylases is tested. Response surface methodology is chosen to test the effects of main applied technological parameters on bread quality responses. Independent variables are chosen to be: quantity of added amylase and <b>bulk</b> <b>fermentation</b> time, while analysed responses are: specific volume, grain structure, <b>bulk</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Bread quality responses are statistically significant, while predicted and observed responses correspond very well, which allows good prediction of bread quality parameters based on applied technological parameters and flour characteristics. Score analysis shows that optimum quantity of amylase addition regarding bread quality depends on the activity of naturally existing amylases. Optimal quantity of added xylanase in bread samples made from both flour types is 0. 004 %. Xylanase improved properties of white wheat bread and higher effect is experienced with flour that has more active naturally existing amylases. Addition of amylase has statistically significantly increased a* values of crust.

40|$|The {{processes}} of grain milling {{as well as}} bread making both have a very long history {{and the evolution of}} current practices has seen many changes in both processing and formulation of baked goods. White flour is preferred as the primary ingredient rather than wholemeal. In addition there has been a trend to abandon sourdough fermentation and adopt rapid bread making procedures. However growing evidence indicates that traditional approaches offer significant health advantages to consumers. Accordingly, the purpose of this project has been to investigate the significance of various aspects of bread making in relation to the health implications of bread. For this purpose loaves have been prepared by applying <b>bulk</b> and sourdough <b>fermentation</b> using freshly milled whole grains. Various components have been investigated and the effects of fermentation time and temperature evaluated for selected blends of wholemeal grains. In order to study the stability and retention of vitamin E components, the possibility and advantages of replacing hexane with the less toxic (and greener) option of heptane for HPLC analysis was evaluated. Strategies to increase the quantity of vitamin E were found and the optimal fermentation conditions established. The use of palm oil as an ingredient in bread making was demonstrated as a means to increase the vitamin E content of wholemeal breads and a further advantage was the wider range of E vitamers retained during baking. To evaluate factors influencing phytate levels and resistant starch (RS) formation, the effects of fermentation time and temperature on selected wholemeal flours from rye, oats and wheat were also investigated. Fermentation temperature was found to make only a small difference to the degree of phytate reduction and the formation of resistant starch (RS). The presence of palm oil in formulations decreased the RS content in rye bread when added at 8 %. The rye sourdough fermentation gave the greatest formation of RS and temperature also influenced the levels to some extent. Rye sourdough fermentation because of the lowering of pH appeared to have a greater effect on RS formation than that observed for bulk fermented wholemeal breads. A further series of trials were been carried out to evaluate the detoxification of gliadin by a partially purified preparation of the papaya enzyme caricain. The incorporation of the enzyme directly into wholemeal wheat dough demonstrated that caricain is able to detoxify wheat to a level at where it is less of a problem for coeliac sufferers and this approach warrants further investigation in baking as well as other processes using cereal grains, particularly wheat and rye. Accordingly, the results of the phases of this investigation show that some of the more traditional approaches in milling and baking do have potential as ways to enhance the nutritional profile of baked goods. Various ways to provide health benefits are therefore recommended and these impact upon the vitamin E and resistant starch contents of breads...|$|R

This “enzyme–microbe synergy” requires the presence of metabolically active cellulolytic microbes, is not explained by removal of hydrolysis products from the <b>bulk</b> <b>fermentation</b> broth, and appears due to surface phenomena involving adherent cellulolytic microorganisms.

40|$|Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Torulaspora delbrueckii {{isolated}} from traditional bread doughs displayed dough-raising capacities {{similar to the}} ones found in baker’s yeasts. During storage of frozen doughs, strains of T. delbrueckii (IGC 5321, IGC 5323, and IGC 4478) presented approximately the same leavening ability for 30 days. Cell viability was not significantly affected by freezing, but when the dough was submitted to a <b>bulk</b> <b>fermentation</b> before being stored at 220 &C, there was a decrease in the survival ratio which depended on the yeast strain. Furthermore, the leavening ability after 4 days of storage decreased as the prefermentation period of the dough before freezing increased, except for strains IGC 5321 and IGC 5323. These two strains retained their fermentative activity after 15 days of storage and 2. 5 h of prefermentation, despite showing a reduction of viable cells under the same conditions. The intracellular trehalose content was higher than 20 % (wt/wt) in four of the yeasts tested: the two commercial strains of baker’s yeast (S. cerevisiae IGC 5325 and IGC 5326) and the two mentioned strains of T. delbrueckii (IGC 5321 and IGC 5323). However, the strains of S. cerevisiae were clearly more susceptible to freezing damages, indicating that other factors may contribute to the freeze tolerance of these yeasts...|$|E
40|$|Interactions among dietary {{ingredients}} are often assumed non-existent when evaluating the nutritive value and {{health effects of}} dietary fiber. Specific fibers can distinctly affect digestive processes; therefore, digestibility and fermentability of the complete diet may depend on fiber types present. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of readily fermentable fibers (β-glucans and resistant starch) {{on the degradation of}} feed ingredients containing more persistent, recalcitrant, fibers. Six semi-synthetic diets with recalcitrant fibers from rapeseed meal (pectic polysaccharides, xyloglucans, and cellulose) or corn distillers dried grain with solubles (DDGS; (glucurono) arabinoxylans and cellulose) with or without inclusion of β-glucans (6 %) or retrograded tapioca (40 %) substituted for corn starch were formulated. Six ileal-cannulated pigs (BW 28 ± 1. 4 kg) were assigned to the diets according to a 6 × 6 Latin square. β-glucan-extract increased apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of non-glucosyl polysaccharides (accounting for ~ 40 % of the fiber-fraction) from rapeseed meal (6 %-units, P 10 %-units, P< 0. 001), indicating that the large amount of resistant starch entering the hindgut was preferentially degraded over recalcitrant fibers from rapeseed meal and DDGS, possibly related to reduced hindgut-retention time following the increased intestinal <b>bulk.</b> <b>Fermentation</b> of fiber sources was not only dependent on fiber characteristics, but also on the presence of other fibers in the diet. Hence, interactions in the gastrointestinal tract among fibrous feed ingredients should be considered when evaluating their nutritive value...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of various amounts of sourdough on the rheological properties of the dough, on texture and colour parameters after baking and during storage. Sourdough (SD) {{has been used in}} bread manufacture since ancient times because its beneficial effects on dough leavening. SD is a symbiotic culture of lactobacilli (LAB) and yeasts, giving a distinctively tangy or sour taste, due mainly to the lactic and acetic acid produced by the LAB. The presence in Sardinia of a big number and types of breads lead to consider the cycle of the bread as a phenomenon characterizing the Sardinian traditional culture. A commercial blend of semolina and re-milled semolina of Sardinia were used in this study. Commercial compressed yeast (L) (1010 cells/g, dry matter) and sourdough (6 x 108 cells/g of Lactobacillus and 3 x 107 cells/g of yeasts) were used as a starter. Unfermented bread doughs were prepared by mixing ingredients in a 10 kg mixer at 60 turns/min up to optimum dough development. Fermented doughs were obtained after <b>bulk</b> <b>fermentation</b> (30 min), dividing (600 g doughs), rounding, resting (5 min) panning and proofing up to maximum volume increment. Fermented doughs were baked at 185 °C for 25 min to make pan breads. After 2 h of cooling, fresh breads were packaged in coextruded polypropylene bags and stored for 10 days at 20 ± 1 °C.

30|$|The {{upstream}} {{stages of}} the Pan Bauletto bread chain (i.e. imports of soft wheat, and other primary inputs) occur at continental level while the following stages occur at the national level. Fuel supply, machinery and energy represent the most global inputs throughout the chain, although not as specific as wheat. Barilla company both sources soft wheat for internal milling (30  %) and buys flour directly from other milling companies (70  %). Soft wheat supplies are based on production contracts with farmers according to specific quality specifications (or specific varieties that have the desired characteristics). The price is set {{on the basis of}} the commodity board of exchange or bargained at the beginning of the season: it may vary according to the amount purchased, and a premium price is granted when the farmers comply with Barilla’s specification on wheat growing and storage and/or the wheat displays some specific quality characteristics. The requirements are strict because the industrial baking process cannot be adjusted “manually” (as the handcraft baker would do). Hence, there is the need for highly standardized raw material suitable for specific dough rising times and strength of flour. For flour, Barilla refers to three main millers with whom it makes contracts from 3 to 6  months. In this case it is not possible to know the exact origin of the grain. The main suppliers of flour are Italian, because flour is highly perishable during transportation. The production process occurs in two plants based in the North and South of Italy (i.e. Cremona and Melfi, respectively). Secondary processes include mixing of raw ingredients (flour, water, salt and yeast) to form a dough; <b>bulk</b> <b>fermentation,</b> division of dough into individual loaf-sized pieces, molding, proofing; baking of pieces in gas oven; cooling and packaging; production of packaging material; delivery of products to distribution platforms. Distribution channels of packaged soft bread entail large scale distribution for most part (75  %) then there are individual traders and retailers, all over Italy. The price list is national, there are discounts and promotions depending on the local market. Production processes allow a long shelf life (over 45  days) without the use of preservatives: at the end of the process the loaves are kept in sterile rooms, without any contamination and with addition of a splash of ethanol (a mild antibacterial). The longer shelf life of the product allows very low levels of waste at the distribution and consumption levels. Differently from what happens to industrial bread production in other countries, this long shelf-life is due to the peculiarity of the Italian bread market: indeed, the Italian consumers normally use industrial bread in the absence of freshly baked bread.|$|E
