Smith would <b>be</b> <b>learning</b> under a fourth different offensive coordinator in four seasons; Jim Hostler was fired and replaced by former Detroit Lions offensive coordinator and St. Louis Rams offensive coordinator/head coach Mike Martz. Unlike the previous three seasons, where offensive continuity was somewhat maintained, Martz's system was completely different. Smith lost the starting job in {{training camp}} to O'Sullivan, who was elevated to starting quarterback, partly due to his familiarity with Martz's offense {{when he was a}} member of the Detroit Lions.|$|E
25|$|The National Public Radio investigative {{report on}} Acu-Gen {{predicted}} that parents {{may use the}} Baby Gender Mentor test {{as a basis for}} determining whether to get a sex-selective abortion. KMSP-TV interviewed genetic counselor Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction. The concern is that learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. Americans United for Life argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early.

500|$|A few critics {{disagree}} with the speculation over Giraud's and Byron's relationship. The early 20th-century biographer Ethel Mayne points out both the frequency of such relationships in Byron's life and their inherent ambiguity when she says, [...] "His stay was also marked by one of those ambiguous friendships with a youth infinitely below him in rank which have already been seen to recur in his life... The patron was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>learning</b> Italian from this made a pretext for giving him, on their parting at Malta in 1811... a considerable sum of money". Elizabeth Longford, in her 1976 biography, disagrees with the claims {{that there was a}} physical relationship between the two and argues, [...] "Byron's especial favourite among the 'ragazzi' was Nicolo Giraud. He had first taken up with Nicolo while Hobhouse was away in Euboea the year before, but {{there is no evidence that}} his feelings for Nicolo were anything but romantic and protective." [...] Jerome Christensen followed this view in 1993 and adds, [...] "we know little more than what Byron tells us".|$|E

2500|$|The {{transmission}} of individual stories and customs within a family depends {{for the most}} part upon the personality, character, and lifestyle of individual family members. It is not normally passed along as part of a defined family role. As a family reshapes itself around each birth, death, marriage and other life events, individual members elect to pick up items of family lore to own and perform. This might <b>be</b> <b>learning</b> a skill, telling a story (or story cycle) or baking a traditional pie for the Thanksgiving table. The {{transmission of}} individual items can picked up by several different family members, for example when several grown siblings use a family recipe or tradition in their own households. This type of transmission through multiple individuals was first described in an article by Dégh and Vázsonyi as [...] "multi-conduit transmission". By choosing to own a piece of the family lore, a family member signifies that this tradition embodies beliefs and values to which he adheres. By successfully transmitting it further within the family, these beliefs and values come to define the family.|$|E
