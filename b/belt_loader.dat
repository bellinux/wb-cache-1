50|$|Belt loaders are {{vehicles}} with conveyor belts for unloading and loading of baggage and cargo onto aircraft. A <b>belt</b> <b>loader</b> is positioned {{at the door}} sill of an aircraft hold (baggage compartment) during operation. Belt loaders are used for narrowbody aircraft, and the bulk hold of wide body aircraft. Stowing baggage without containers is known as bulk loading.|$|E

5000|$|Subsidies {{are another}} {{powerful}} policy tool used by governments to influence economic behavior. Subsidies {{can take many}} forms, ranging from tax credits to direct cash payments. To limit mobile source pollution from airports, for example, the Federal Aviation Administration's [...] "Voluntary Airport Low Emission Program" [...] provides funding to U.S. commercial service airports located in air quality non attainment and maintenance areas. While the funding {{can be used to}} reduce emissions from both mobile and stationary sources at the airport, much of the program's emphasis is on mobile source emission reduction. The program promotes the use of electric ground support equipment, such as electric bag tugs that take luggage from the airplane to the baggage claim. Other airport equipment that can be electronically operated include various types of <b>belt</b> <b>loaders,</b> along with the pushback tractors that assist airplanes when departing from the gate.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the dawn}} of aviation, cargo loading on {{aircraft}} has remained virtually constant. A person and a baggage cart together have been the primary method of loading baggage on to aircraft, and this practice has virtually remained unchanged, especially for narrow body aircraft. This study explores {{the question of whether}} a loading device, designed for Embraer 190 aircraft, can increase economic efficiency by reducing aircraft turnaround times, increasing aircraft utilization and reducing work hours. In the course of designing a theoretical loading device for an Embraer 190, various literature ranging from elaborate articulating conveyor belts, to the use of LD 3 - 45 W containers in Airbus 320 aircraft were analyzed. In the pursuit of understanding ground operations with containers, the study looked at the Boeing 767 - 300 and the Boeing 777 - 200 LR to analyze the timeliness in which containers can be loaded and unloaded from an aircraft. With the goal of using common narrow body ground support equipment, time trials were done with a Purdue University baggage <b>belt</b> <b>loader</b> to see if loading a container on a conventional <b>belt</b> <b>loader</b> was feasible. To create a theoretical working container design, the LD 3 - 45 W boundaries in relation to the Airbus 320 aircraft cargo walls was scaled to match the Embraer 190 s. With this scale, a container size could be derived, as well as volume, capacity, tare weight and maximum weight. In determining these various parameters, the amount of baggage that could be placed in 11 loading device containers was determined. With these figures an extensive comparison between loading baggage by hand and loading baggage utilizing containers, was analyzed. ...|$|E
40|$|Directed Technologies, Inc. has {{completed}} three analysis {{projects for the}} hydrogen program office during the past year: a detailed mass production cost estimate for stationary proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell systems, {{an assessment of the}} costs of producing electricity from stationary fuel cells for buildings with hydrogen and heat cogeneration, and a preliminary assessment of the use of hydrogen for airport ground support equipment. We conclude that the economic case for producing both hydrogen and electricity from stationary fuel cell systems is stronger than the economic case for selling only electricity to the building owner. This co-generation of hydrogen and electricity is particularly attractive for stationary fuel cell systems with greater than 50 kW of electrical capacity. The economics of small residential fuel cell systems in the 3 to 5 kW range are not promising, however, based on our current cost assessments. Three types of airport ground support equipment were analyzed in terms of converting to hydrogen fuel cell operation: a 22 -foot shuttle bus, a baggage <b>belt</b> <b>loader,</b> and a baggage tractor. We compared the likely performance and cost of hydrogen-powered ground support equipment with that of battery-powered vehicles. We conclude that hydrogen-powered vehicles could be less costly to purchase an...|$|E
40|$|JetBlue Airways Corporation, a Fortune 500 {{company based}} in New York City, is an airline that {{services}} 87 destinations across the U. S., Caribbean, and Latin America. From 2010 to 2014, JetBlue has made its overall operations increasingly more energy efficient, resulting in an 8. 3 % decline in greenhouse gas emissions intensity ratio (metric tons CO 2 -eq per 1, 000 revenue ton miles flown), which has also saved the company {{millions of dollars in}} operating costs. As JetBlue continues to enhance its efforts to couple sustainability with economic value, a logical next step was to evaluate JetBlue’s ground fleet for potential improvement. Our analysis focused on ground support operations at JetBlue’s Terminal 5 at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York. Responsible for 13, 800 metric tons of CO 2 -eq emissions, the function of ground support equipment (GSE) vehicles is to service the aircraft between flights. Our study included the three most used vehicle types—bag tug, <b>belt</b> <b>loader,</b> and push back tug—as they offered the largest opportunity for savings. Our study explored the economic and environmental opportunities associated with replacing current gasoline and diesel-powered GSE vehicles with electric vehicles, also called eGSE. This report first provides background on JetBlue Airways, its environmental impacts, and the airline’s sustainability program. It provides general emissions trends within the transportation sector before narrowing in on ground vehicles, where it details their specific function and describes emissions standards that apply to off-road GSE. The report then details the first step within our analysis in which we review JetBlue-provided GSE data, including a system-wide inventory and ground fuel expenditures dataset by airport. This report summarizes this data by describing the composition of JetBlue’s JFK ground vehicles by function, quantity, and energy inputs. We then consider energy reduction strategies for the GSE fleet by describing available alternative fuel sources and evaluating relevant efforts by other airlines and airports. The next stage of our analysis consisted of interviews with JetBlue employees and associated business partners and stakeholders, whose commentary and feedback have been integrated into the report. Data was also recorded on the ground at JFK to better understand the operation and retrieve accurate daily vehicle usage data. In the final stage of the analysis, all data was synthesized into a model that estimated how much gasoline or diesel the average bag tug, <b>belt</b> <b>loader,</b> and push back tug is using, as well as how much JetBlue spends per vehicle in powering it annually. Based off data from a GSE manufacturer, we calculated what the energy costs savings would be if all vehicles would run off of electricity instead of gasoline or diesel. Lastly, we modeled eight scenarios in which JetBlue would change a portion of their fleet to electric, and for each scenario the model projected fuel costs and emissions savings. Page | 2 Based on the incentives described in this report, we recommend the following for JetBlue’s GSE fleet at JFK: 1. Pursue push back electrification secondary to bag tug and <b>belt</b> <b>loader</b> 2. Launch pilot to test 1 charger, 2 belt loaders, and 1 bag tug at JFK 3. Apply for the FAA’s Voluntary Airport Low Emissions Program (VALE) funding 4. Set goal of 20 % electric bag tugs and belt loaders in 3 -year period (by 2019), replacing vehicles as they retire. In a worst case scenario where JetBlue receives no funding and pays the higher cost for all new vehicles instead of refurbished, JetBlue will save roughly $ 1. 7 million and 36, 500 metric tons of CO 2 -eq emissions across a 14 -year timeline. 5. Set goal of 50 % electric belt loaders and bag tugs in a 7 -year period (by 2023), replacing vehicles as they retire. In a worst case scenario where JetBlue receives no funding and pays the higher cost for all new vehicles instead of refurbished, JetBlue will save roughly $ 4. 3 million and 89, 200 metric tons of CO 2 -eq emissions across a 14 -year timeline. 6. Research feasibility of retrofitting 100 % electric belt loaders, bag tugs, and push backs, replacing vehicles are they retire. This can maximize the opportunity to save roughly $ 7 million in fuel costs (assuming funding is received) and over 60, 000 metric tons of CO 2 -equivalent emissions over 14 years...|$|E
