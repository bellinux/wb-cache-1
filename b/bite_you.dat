500|$|The Flukeman—also known affectionately as [...] "Flukey" [...] by {{the cast}} and crew—was portrayed by Darin Morgan, brother of {{executive}} producer Glen Morgan. He would become {{a staff writer for}} the show later in the second season. The Flukeman suit used by Morgan, which included flipper-like feet, yellow contact lenses, and fake teeth, took six hours to put on; this process was eventually sped up. Morgan wore the suit as much as 20 consecutive hours during shooting. As a result, he was forced to go to the bathroom while still wearing the suit. Morgan was rarely on set without being in full costume, and recalled that when he met up with David Duchovny again upon joining the series' writing staff, the actor had no idea who he was, despite having enjoyed an amiable relationship with the costumed Morgan previously. The suit dissolved in water, forcing special effects artist Toby Lindala to reconstruct the suit each day. Because the suit did not permit Morgan to breathe through his nose, he was unable to eat while wearing it. Carter described the character as [...] "the embodiment of everyone's sense of vulnerability, the idea of something that exists in the underworld of the sewer system and might in fact come to <b>bite</b> <b>you</b> in the least elegant of places". The original intention was showing even less of the Flukeman, but some angles and lighting ended up revealing more of the creature's design. Carter still felt it helped to [...] "get more creepy", as the Flukeman is not shown fully until the final scenes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't, sir," [...] {{answered}} the butler. [...] "My young lady has ordered the glass dog to bark whenever you call here. You'd better look out, sir," [...] he added, [...] "for if it <b>bites</b> <b>you,</b> {{you may have}} glassophobia!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} Dog; [...] "if I were to accept that, {{it might be}} thought that in <b>biting</b> <b>you</b> I was {{actuated}} by improper motives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ya c'n trample on {{the poor}} man's face," [...] said Officer Cassidy, severely; [...] "but don't be {{surprised}} if one day he <b>bites</b> <b>you</b> in the leg!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Carlton Blanchard: {{played by}} William Hickey, Carlton {{is an old}} man with a high-pitched nasal voice whose {{outwardly}} meek yet privately demanding behavior causes everyone who meets him to shudder at his coming. He is also known for asking bizarre questions such as [...] "If you were to carpet Florida, {{how long would it take}} to vacuum it?" [...] and [...] "If a monkey were to <b>bite</b> <b>you,</b> what kind of drugs do you suppose they'd give you?". He annoys Joe, Brian, Lowell and Antonio when he wins a charity contest sponsored by Sandpiper and demands to be flown to Las Cruces, New Mexico, far beyond the scope of Sandpiper's routes.|$|E
2500|$|The Ganassi {{team also}} {{competed in the}} prestigious Indianapolis 500 race, part of the rival Indy Racing League series using a G-Force chassis and a Comptech-tuned Oldsmobile Aurora engine. Media and drivers were {{critical}} of the way Montoya approached the Brickyard, and many IRL drivers labelled him as reckless and predicted an early retirement from the race. The media activity around the event was intense, with Montoya and his CART teammate Jimmy Vasser being the first CART drivers to [...] "cross-over" [...] to drive in the Indy 500. Despite public warnings from two-time Indy 500 winner Al Unser, Jr. claiming that if a driver does not respect the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the place [...] "will <b>bite</b> <b>you</b> – hard" [...] Montoya shrugged off the advice claiming that all four corners were exactly the same and that the track required less attention than the road courses in the CART series and in European racing.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sure I did," [...] said Peter, with sullen quietness. [...] "I reckon you needn't bother about Jimmy. Something's <b>bitten</b> <b>you.</b> Stannard's all right. If he can't help us, we {{have got}} to freeze." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you mean,' said Gerald, {{with the}} punctiliousness {{of a man}} who has been drinking, 'that you are afraid of the sight of a black-beetle, or you are afraid of a black-beetle <b>biting</b> <b>you,</b> or doing you some harm?' ...|$|R
50|$|Fortunately, when a tick <b>bites</b> <b>you,</b> it {{does not}} {{automatically}} transfer diseases to their host. Instead, {{they need to be}} attached to the host around 6-8 hours before they are capable of transferring the disease. This gives the host an opportunity to remove this parasite before disease transmission occurs.|$|R
6000|$|... "One more step, Mr. Hands," [...] said I, [...] "and I'll {{blow your}} brains out! Dead men don't <b>bite,</b> <b>you</b> know," [...] I {{added with a}} chuckle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to look}} at no legs while I'm at dinner," [...] {{cried the}} skipper. [...] "O' course the dog'll <b>bite</b> <b>you</b> if you've been teasing him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There's another thing," [...] he said, {{swinging}} round {{suddenly and}} causing his sister to drop another stitch. [...] "Maybe you think he's {{some kind of}} a Dago, this guy? Maybe that's what's <b>biting</b> <b>you.</b> Let me tell you that he's an American--pretty near as much an American as you are yourself." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Inject The Venom": [...] "Thats a power {{thing like}} For Those About To Rock. It just means, have it hot." [...] Brian Johnson: [...] "Theres one line that says, if you inject the venom {{it will be}} your last attack. Which is like a snake - once it <b>bites</b> <b>you</b> its got nothing left." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But when a horse kicks and <b>bites,</b> <b>you</b> {{know his}} nature {{and do not}} go near him. When a man has cheated you once, you think he will cheat you again, {{and you do not}} deal with him. You do not look to gather grapes from thistles, after you have found that they are thistles." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No; {{you miss}} many pleasures," [...] remarked the cab-horse, pityingly. [...] "You {{do not know}} the relief of {{brushing}} away a fly that has <b>bitten</b> <b>you,</b> nor the delight of eating delicious food, nor the satisfaction of drawing a long breath of fresh, pure air. You may be an imitation of a horse, but you're a mighty poor one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a pretty}} little beast, marked black and white, and {{about the size of}} a big weasel. It has got a way of coming and <b>biting</b> <b>you</b> when you are asleep, and when it does it is sartin death; thar ain't no cure for it; the best plan is to put your Colt to your head and finish it at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She hasn't <b>bitten</b> <b>you,</b> has she? Oh, {{they do it}} sometimes! What lies has {{she been}} telling you of me? Oh, they lie in the most abominable manner! What? She has been talking of me in the kindest terms? Then why {{did she want to}} get out of my hearing? Ah, they're so infernally deceitful! I do hate mad people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is nothing}} of the kind. On your own showing he didn't even <b>bite</b> <b>you</b> once. And every dog is allowed one bite by law. The case of Wilberforce v. Bayliss covers that point thoroughly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take hold of this spade for {{a little}} while, an' they won't <b>bite</b> <b>you.</b> It seems to me I'm doin' all the work, an' I know you ate more'n your share of the supper an' breakfast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Never mind; {{you tell}} her. She won't <b>bite</b> <b>you.</b> Tell her also that I shall be over at Granpere soon {{to see her}} {{and the rest of}} them. I'll be over--as soon as ever I can get away.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If <b>you</b> <b>bite</b> your nails, for example. Then, {{when you}} don't want to bite your nails, bite them, make {{yourself}} <b>bite</b> them. And <b>you</b> {{would find the}} habit was broken.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Humphrey, {{at least}} you were saved. Then came another trouble. You took fever. Bickley {{said that it was}} because a certain gnat had <b>bitten</b> <b>you</b> when you went down to the ship, and my father, the Lord Oro, told me that this was right. At the least you grew very weak and lost your mind, and it seemed as though you must die. Then, Humphrey, I went to the Lord Oro and kneeled before him and prayed for your life, for I knew that he could cure you if he would, though Bickley's skill was at an end.|$|R

6000|$|... "Lie quite still, Tim," [...] he said, [...] "and don't be afraid. We {{will try}} to kill him, without his {{touching}} you; {{but even if he}} should <b>bite</b> <b>you,</b> with help ready at hand, there will be no danger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The spider {{had no idea}} {{of attacking}} you, Kelly," [...] Peters said, laughing. [...] "It might {{possibly}} <b>bite</b> <b>you</b> in the night, though I do not think it would do so; or if you took it up in your fingers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I explained, it can't be banished. There's {{always a}} richer claim somewhere that you haven't found. Our prospectors dream {{of it as}} the Mother Lode, and some spend half their lives in search of it; it was called El Dorado three hundred years ago. After all, the idea's a deeper thing than a miner's fantasy: in one shape or another it's {{inherent}} in optimistic human nature.

6000|$|... 'Why {{should we}} think you did it?' said Lady Wetherby, bitterly. 'You had a grudge against the poor brute for <b>biting</b> <b>you.</b> We find you hiding here with a pistol and a story about burglars which an infant couldn't swallow. I suppose you thought that, if you planted the poor creature's body here, it {{would be up to}} Algie to get rid of it, and that if he were found with it I should think that it was he who had killed the animal.' ...|$|R
