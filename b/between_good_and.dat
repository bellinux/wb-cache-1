5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil, which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view {{is reinforced by the}} rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in comparison to the immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{incorporates}} the stylised fact of labour market rationing into {{an analysis of}} marginal tax reform in Ireland. In the absence of weak separability <b>between</b> <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> leisure, labour market rationing will have both substitution and income effects.

40|$|Using Mexican data on {{household}} {{time use}} and consumption, we find significant substitution <b>between</b> <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> time in home production and different elasticities of substitution for different household commodities. Adding these {{findings to the}} Ramsey optimal tax problem, we show it is optimal to impose higher taxes on market goods used {{in the production of}} commodities with a lower elasticity of substitution <b>between</b> <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> time. The reason is that government wants to minimize the distortionary substitution from market purchases toward untaxed time use in home production. This is an analog of the classical Corlett and Hague (1953 - 1954) result, differing in that we allow for the possibility of substitution <b>between</b> <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> time in the production of commodities. Leaving aside distributional considerations, we conclude that higher taxes should be imposed on market goods used in the production of `Eating' and lower taxes imposed on market goods used in the production of `Recreation'...|$|R

Lord Ao, the Overdeity, forced the gods to become mortal until the Tablets were found; some gods died while in this mortal state.|$|E

40|$|More {{than three}} decades of {{research}} on trade costs <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> trade have unveiled fundamental insights into the determinants, the nature {{and the consequences of}} goods trade agreements. A cottage literature has also evolved studying similar issues from a services trade perspective, but the two-way interaction <b>between</b> <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services trade has not been explored formally. We bridge this gap by providing a formal treatment of the inter-linkages <b>between</b> <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services trade. The model provides insights into how trade agreements impact <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services trade. We also explore the impact of the complementarities of <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services agreements on <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services trade empirically using bilateral <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services trade data for OECD and BRICS trading partners over 1995 - 2010...|$|R

5|$|According to {{the epic}} poem Mahabharata, Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, {{but on the}} {{condition}} that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his Gandiv (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
5|$|The Smallville {{incarnation}} of the character is first introduced as a morally ambiguous character, who walks a fine line <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil. Lex is an inquisitive person, {{and it is that}} curiosity that drives him to attain as much power as possible as the series progresses—it will ultimately lead him to being Clark's greatest enemy. Michael Rosenbaum has been nominated for and won a Saturn Award and a Teen Choice Award for his portrayal of Lex Luthor on Smallville. After seven seasons as a series regular, Michael Rosenbaum left the show, but reprised the role for the two-hour series finale.|$|E

5|$|The {{challenges}} and quests {{were developed to}} keep players occupied while playing through the story. Molyeux told Leach about the ways {{of good and evil}} and the system's reflection of the player's behaviour, and provided him with a digital copy of the Bible with instructions to study the concepts due to their connection with gods and men. Leach decided to supplement the idea of evil with mischief, as he thought being completely evil by annoying or killing followers was senseless. Molyneux wanted a conflict <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil, and for the enemy gods to have the opposite alignment to the player. As a method of introducing the player to miracles and combat, a god whose alignment {{is the same as the}} player's was added.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Black finds a {{group of}} obelisks in the woods. He is about to examine one when Beebe appears, chased by dogs. The Old Man also arrives, and Black asks him to call off his dogs. The Old Man denies the dogs are his, but they retreat regardless. Black then sees that the obelisks all bear an ouroboros, {{the symbol of the}} Millennium Group. He visits the Old Man's home, where the two speak about the Group and its symbolism, and the coming millennium. The Old Man then brings Black to a {{clearing}} full of the wild dogs, where the latter realizes they are embodiments of the evil in the world. He approaches them as stands his ground, being struck by several visions as he does so. The Old Man then explains that the world's balance <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil is being lost as the millennium approaches, and that Beebe's home, built on sacred ground, {{is one of the many}} small things upsetting this balance.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the studio's history, many {{projects}}—including Futureblight, Dwarves, Aliens: Crucible, and Stormlands—were cancelled. Due {{to having}} so many projects cancelled, the company entered a severe financial crisis in 2012. As a result, Obsidian decided to crowdfund their next game, Pillars of Eternity, a role-playing game played from an isometric perspective, which ultimately became a success and saved the studio from closure. The team's focus then changed from developing licensed titles to creating original games {{based on the}} studio's own intellectual property. Obsidian has developed {{a close relationship with}} another studio that was founded by ex-Interplay Entertainment employees, inXile Entertainment. The company's latest games are Tyranny, a role-playing game set in a world where the war <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil has been fought with evil coming out on top, and Armored Warfare, a massively multiplayer online game with a focus on controlling tanks.|$|E

5|$|Use of {{insanity}} {{as a concept}} dates from 1324, and its criminal application was used until the late 16th century in an almost identical way. The defence, if successful, either allowed the defendant to return home or led to him being incarcerated until he was granted a royal pardon; after 1542, a defendant who became insane prior to the trial could not be tried for any crime, {{up to and including}} high treason. During the 18th century the test to determine insanity became extremely narrow, with defendants required to prove that they could not distinguish <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil and that they suffered from a mental disease which made them incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions. The current wording comes from the M'Naghten Rules, based on the trial of Daniel M'Naghten in 1843.|$|E
5|$|While {{the last}} three Fire Emblem titles had used a similar setting, with Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and Mystery of the Emblem both being set on the {{continent}} of Archanea, Kaga wanted to create something new for his next title. This was for two reasons: he wanted {{to move beyond the}} confines of Archanea, and also wanted to try his hand at a large-scale historical drama. Similar to other Fire Emblem titles, the setting drew inspiration from Medieval Europe. The story's inspiration changed, drawing from Norse and Celtic mythology as opposed to the elements from Classical mythology used by earlier titles. Similar to Mystery of the Emblem, the story was split into two halves, with the first half acting as an introduction for Seliph's quest. The story's main theme was how the stupidity of humans could forge history. The focus shifted away from the characters to the overall world of Jugdral, intended to show the scale of the conflict and make it seem like history in the making. While the backstory of Jugdral featured a clearly defined battle <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil, the main story's distinction <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil was blurred, exemplified by the descendants of the Twelve Crusaders being on opposing sides rather than united. A stated example was Alvis, whose conquests were driven by a wish to end discrimination against Loptyr descendants. Due to this, Kaga did not create a storyline focused on poetic justice and morality, instead aiming for a more realistic scenario. This realism also prompted the inclusion of elements such as patricide and incest, which had occurred in history but were not typically included in gaming narratives at the time. The story originally had three acts rather than two. The missing act would have covered the period {{between the first and second}} act, which put a more overt focus on the themes of patricide and incest. Due to time constraints, this third act needed to be cut. In a later interview, Kaga felt that the focus on narrative weakened the gameplay.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the association among price, exchange rates {{and interest rates}} in ASEAN- 5 economies. Several studies have suggested {{the importance of the}} linkages <b>between</b> <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> assets market in the determination of exchange rates and one way to account for such linkages is to incorporate interest rate and prices. By using cointegration test, we found evidence on the long run relationship among the variables indicating the importance of interest rate and price on exchange rate when structural break is considered. The findings thus show that the linkages <b>between</b> <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> assets market found in developed countries has general applicability to other small open economies specifically for Malaysia only when structural break caused by the financial crisis 1997 is considered. The diferent in results far the sub period indicate that not only {{it is important to consider}} multivariate approach but also the impact of financial crisis in the future research examining exchange rate in ASEAN- 5 countries...|$|R
