40|$|Based on {{the model}} {{suggested}} in an accompanying paper[1], diodes having the multilayered n+ipvn+ structure have been fabricated from silicon material using ion implantation techniques. Systematic descriptions of their fabrication and evaluation are presented. Microwave CW oscillations at C-band (∼ 7. 5 Ghz) have been observed in some of our devices. The measured maximum power output was {{in the range of}} 40 mw and the efficiency was ∼ 5 %. The obtained efficiency is the best reported for any <b>BARITT</b> <b>diode.</b> This result indicatest hat the retarding field region in BARITT diodes may be used advantageously to provide a favorable phase delay between the injected current and the a. c. voltage and leads to improved efficiency BARITT oscillators. © 1977. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have been}} made on a new n+ipvn+ reach through {{structure}} operated as a <b>BARITT</b> <b>diode.</b> Unlike earlier BARITT structures, the present one has an additional region (the i-layer) added to it so as to provide a longer retarding field region. By {{taking advantage of the}} carrier diffusion at low velocities against an opposing field in this region, the injected current may be delayed relative to the a. c. voltage and improved efficiency BARITT diodes can be expected. In this paper, a one dimensional model is used to illustrate the basic operating mode and advantages of the structure. A d. c. analysis is performed and expressions for the reach through voltage and, critical voltage at which the space charge effects of the injected carriers become apparent are obtained. Furthermore an a. c. analysis is made and a relation for the transit time delay in the retarding field region is developed. © 1977. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The {{recently}} studied planar-doped triangular barrier {{structure is}} analyzed theoretically {{for a possible}} application as a barrier injection transit time device (BARMT). The small signal impedance {{as well as the}} large-signal power characteristics are calculated. Compared to the conventional Bm structures the new device offers a sign&ant improvement i its frequency range and generated power. The idea of two-terminal devices with a negative dynam-ical resistance arising from the transit-time effect in semiconductor structures was first considered by Shock-ley in 1954. A number of devices have been since pro-posed and implemented based on this principle (Ref. [l], Chap. IO), the most important of those being the IM-PATT and <b>BARITT</b> <b>diodes.</b> All transit time devices contain a high-field region in which carriers travel at saturated velocity and develop a charge density wave which contributes to a phase delay between the ac cur-rent and voltage. For physical reasons this delay canno...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} semiconductor devices {{in which the}} transport of carriers is controlled by punch-through space-charge effects. Examples include the Bipolar Mode Static Induction Transistor (BSIT), ultrasmall Punch-through MOSFETs, and <b>BARITT</b> <b>diodes</b> for microwave applications. The development of punch-through space-charge type of devices is a technology motivated by the demanding high density among the IC chips. This dissertation discusses a device which operates in a punch-through condition with space-charge control of currents. It is a two terminal device, which could be fabricated with no deviation from today's technology. The device structure is simple, with two n⁺ or p⁺ regions formed in p⁻ or n⁻ substrate, respectively. Punch-through space-charge limited structures both n⁺p⁻n⁺ and p⁺n⁻p⁺, were simulated using a general one-dimensional semiconductor device performance simulation program GESIM 1 for dynamic and static analysis. The results of simulation show that the potential barrier height decreases with increasing applied potential and with a reduction of the spacing L between the n⁺ diffusion in an n⁺p⁻n⁺ structure. The resistance increases as the spacing L is increased. A two-dimensional analytical model of carrier transport in the device was developed. This model accounts for surface effects {{as well as the}} space-charge limited flow. Also, a one-dimensional model that includes mobile carriers effects on the device operation. Structures of various configurations were fabricated and tested. Electrical evaluations of these structures provided large value resistors in a remarkably small area compare to traditional integrated resistors. The resistance was observed to increase with the spacing L and with the resistivity of the starting substrate. These punch-through space-charge limited loads should have applications as an alternative approach for integrated resistors in high-speed VLSI applications. They can provide very small area, large value resistors based on the space-charge limiting action of the device. The range of resistance value is large, and small dimensions lead to small capacitance and fast switching times...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{improvement}} in measurement accuracy for the slotted-line system used in all admittance measurements allows more accurate determination of package parasitics. We {{are now using}} a five-element equivalent-circuit model, rather than the four-element equivalent-circuit model reported in RLE Progress Report No. 117 (pp. 25 - 26). Fig-ure VII- 1 shows the new equivalent-circuit model for package parasitics composed of a single lead-wire connection (0. 001 " diam) and a double lead-wire connection (0. 001 " diam). The new model is highly accurate for representing package parasitics in the 4 - 8 GHz frequency range, which is the frequency range {{of interest in this}} work. This five-element equivalent circuit for package parasitics is used to de-embed the terminal admittance measurements on BARITT diodes back to the diode chip reference plane. A FORTRAN IV program has been written to accomplish the de-embedding. The equivalent circuit proposed to fit the experimentally measured small-signal admittance of the <b>BARITT</b> <b>diode,</b> as shown in Fig. VII- 2, incorporates only frequency-independent elements. These elements, however, will be bias-dependent and RF voltage level-dependent. In order to fit the model to the measured admittance data, accurat...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of these studies}} is to develop improved signal and noise models for solid-state microwave devices. These models are useful for accurate prediction of device characteristics, optimization of design, and improvement of performance in cir-cuit applications. The three devices of interest at present are silicon BARITT diodes, GaAs microwave FETs, and high-efficiency IMPATT diodes. a. BARITT Diodes We have fabricated BARITT diodes and made a detailed characterization of their non-linear properties at microwave frequencies. The measured parameters include small-signal and large-signal device impedance, frequency-modulation sensitivity, and linearity of modulation. We report the following achievements: (i) An improved method of measurement of large-signal impedance for nonlinear diodes. In this method the sensitivity of measurement is high even when the device impedance is small (VSWR high), and the RF voltage across the device can be measured independently. (ii) We have devised a lumped-circuit model for BARITT diodes. This model has shown better agreement with experimentally measured devices; improvement has been found over a wider frequency range than in previous models and its elements can be given physical interpretation. (iii) An extensive set of large-signal measurements for a device with known param-eters has provided a data base for evaluating the theoretical nonlinear models of the <b>BARITT</b> <b>diode.</b> This work is reported in the Ph. D. thesis of Gary K. Montress,l and a paper is being prepared for publication...|$|E
