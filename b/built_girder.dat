25|$|Leven Shreve, a Louisville civic leader, {{became the}} first {{president}} of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L), which was to prove more important for trade. It led to the developing western states and linked with Mississippi River traffic. With the railroads, Louisville could manufacture furniture and other goods, and export products to Southern cities. Louisville {{was on her way to}} becoming an industrial city. The Louisville Rolling Mill <b>built</b> <b>girders</b> and rails, and other factories made cotton machinery, which was sold to Southern customers. Louisville built steamboats. Louisville emerged with an iron-working industry; the plant at Tenth and Main was called Ainslie, Cochran, and Company.|$|R

40|$|There are {{a number}} of bridges which are {{designed}} according to codes without seismic provisions being considered. Such bridges are mostly found deficient and may need seismic retrofitting. Bridges that were built before the 1970 S, either in the USA or Japan or Europe, were designed with little or no consideration for seismic demands. The majority of these bridges are supported on reinforced concrete bents at the abutments and pier walls that lack the ductility and strength to resist earthquakes. Besides most of these bridges have short spans (6 - 18 m) to medium spans (18 - 90 m). A bridge with a short span may be <b>built</b> with timber <b>girders</b> or with a concrete slab superstructure, whereas a bridge with a medium span is often <b>built</b> with steel <b>girders,</b> precast concrete girders, or cast-in-place box girders. Bridges in general consist of two structural components: a superstructure including the elements above the support and a substructure including the elements that sustain the superstructure. In this paper, the retrofitting of an existing short bridge is discussed; it is situated in Treviso (a town in the Venice area) near the vital new airport "Antonio Canova". Retrofit consists of building a new semi-integral bridge type with micro-piers on the bridge heads...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 This thesis {{investigated}} {{the methods of}} failure in the webs of <b>built</b> up <b>girders.</b> The beams had rectangular holes five and one-half inches wide and seven and one-half inches high with rounded corners in a web fourteen inches deep between flanges. The longitudinal position of the hole edge varied from four inches to sixteen inches from the support. The results of the test were compared to analytical analysis for failure by column action, plate buckling and shear in the web. Failure occurred by local crippling in the web in the test beams with holes four and eight inches from the support. The test beams with holes 12 inches and 16 inches from the support failed by yielding of the web under the applied load. The test results indicated that further study is needed of local stress effects {{at the edge of}} the holes...|$|R
25|$|A {{cantilever}} bridge is a bridge built using cantilevers, structures that project horizontally into space, supported {{on only one}} end. For small footbridges, the cantilevers may be simple beams; however, large {{cantilever bridge}}s designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from structural steel, or box <b>girders</b> <b>built</b> from prestressed concrete. The steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into practice, as it can span distances of over , and can be more easily constructed at difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no falsework.|$|R
500|$|During the Second World War the {{government}} was concerned that Axis bombers would target the bridge, and a temporary bridge known as Millbank Bridge was built parallel to Vauxhall Bridge, [...] downstream. Millbank Bridge was <b>built</b> of steel <b>girders</b> supported by wooden stakes; however, despite its flimsy appearance it was a sturdy structure, capable of supporting tanks and other heavy military equipment. In the event, Vauxhall Bridge survived the war undamaged, and in 1948 Millbank Bridge was dismantled. Its girders were shipped to Northern Rhodesia and used to span {{a tributary of the}} Zambezi.|$|R

50|$|The Banpo Bridge (Korean: 반포대교; Hanja: 盤浦大橋) {{is a major}} {{bridge in}} {{downtown}} Seoul over the Han River, South Korea, connecting the Seocho and Yongsan districts. The bridge {{is on top of}} Jamsu Bridge, forming the upper half of a double-deck bridge; it is the first double deck bridge built in South Korea. During periods of high rainfall, the Jamsu Bridge is designed to submerge as the water level of the river rises, as the lower deck lies close to the waterline. The bridge was <b>built</b> as a <b>girder</b> bridge and was completed in 1982.|$|R
25|$|The {{elevated}} section <b>built</b> {{with concrete}} <b>girders</b> was not <b>built</b> {{to withstand the}} use of road salt in the winter. The salt created corrosion of the steel within the concrete bents (vertical columns and horizontal caps), which expanded and weakened the steel, and caused pieces of concrete to fall off. Remedial work had to be applied starting in the 1990s {{at a cost of}} $8 million per year. The remedial work included sealing expansion joints to force the salty water into the drains and extensive patching of the concrete columns. Exposed steel was sand-blasted and repainted.|$|R

The road crossing the bridge is Highway 114, running [...] from Lentini [...] to the south to Cantini [...] to the north. To assist the Italians defending the bridge, four pillbox bunkers had been constructed, two on the north bank and two on the south bank.|$|R
