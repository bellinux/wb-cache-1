This mechanical stress is postulated to be stored in the semi-rigid linker regions between the transmembrane domains and the SNARE helical bundle. The energetically unfavorable bending is minimized when the complex moves peripherally to the site of membrane fusion. As a result, relief of the stress overcomes the repulsive forces between the vesicle and the cell membrane and presses the two membranes together.|$|E

We observe the phase transition phenomenon for non-binary CSPs and study how dynamic bundling performs in the phase transition region.

40|$|Summary: The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the in vivo tensile {{behavior}} of a double-looped semitendinosus and gracilis graft used to reconstruct a torn anterior cruciate ligament in the human knee. In 14 subjects: intraoperative tension was measured for each of the four graft <b>bundles</b> <b>during</b> passive motion from 0 to 90 ° of flexion. Two hypotheses were tested: (a) the peak tension carried by each of the four <b>bundles</b> was equal <b>during</b> passive motion, and (b) the mechanics of the bundles mimicked the functional bands of the native anterior cruciate ligament. The total tension was also calculated and used to determine strength requirements for fixation devices. The peak tensions of the four <b>bundles</b> <b>during</b> passive motion were not equal: however, enough tension was present in each bundle that load-sharing occurred between bundles. The pattern of tension between the anterior and posterior bundles mimicked the reciprocating load-sharing be-havior of the functional bands of the native anterior cruciate ligament. Reciprocal tensile behavior was con-sistently achieved with the use of a single femoral tunnel centered on the most isometric line without the need for two separate femoral sockets. The maximum total tension was 296 N; this was nearly equal to the strength of one commonly used fixation device. The double-looped semitendinosus and gracilis graft is an attractive alternative to the patellar tendon for replacing a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Although material testing result...|$|R

40|$|Activation of {{cytoskeleton}} regulator Rho-kinase during ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) plays a {{major role}} in I/R injury and apoptosis. Since Rho-kinase is a negative regulator of the pro-survival phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) /Akt pathway, we hypothesized that inhibition of Rho-kinase can prevent I/R-induced endothelial cell apoptosis by maintaining PI 3 -kinase/Akt activity and that protective effects of Rho-kinase inhibition are facilitated by prevention of F-actin rearrangement. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were subjected to 1  h of simulated ischemia and 1 or 24  h of simulated reperfusion after treatment with Rho-kinase inhibitor Y- 27632, PI 3 -kinase inhibitor wortmannin, F-actin depolymerizers cytochalasinD and latrunculinA and F-actin stabilizer jasplakinolide. Intracellular ATP levels decreased following I/R. Y- 27632 treatment reduced I/R-induced apoptosis by 31 % (P <  0. 01) and maintained Akt activity. Both effects were blocked by co-treatment with wortmannin. Y- 27632 treatment prevented the formation of F-actin <b>bundles</b> <b>during</b> I/R. Similar results were observed with cytochalasinD treatment. In contrast, latrunculinA and jasplakinolide treatment did not prevent the formation of F-actin <b>bundles</b> <b>during</b> I/R and had no effect on I/R-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis and Akt activity were inversely correlated (R 2  =  0. 68, P <  0. 05).

40|$|Actin is an {{ubiquitous}} {{structural protein}} fundamental to such biological processes as cell motility and muscle contraction. Our model {{system is the}} acrosomal process of the Limulus sperm which extends a 60 ýtm long actin <b>bundle</b> <b>during</b> reproduction. It {{is an example of}} a biological spring where the force of elongation derives from twist energy stored within the <b>bundle</b> <b>during</b> spermatogenesis. In addition to actin the acrosome comprises only one other protein: scruin, an actin-binding protein specific to Limulus that decorates and crosslinks actin filaments into a crystalline bundle. Our goal is to reconstitute the structure of the acrosome using these two proteins in order to further elucidate the role of scruin in actin bundle crosslinking. A multi-scale approach is presented wherein the bending rigidity of scruin bundles and their constituent filaments are probed individually, then inter-related by simple mechanical models. Material properties of filaments and bundles are measured using a combination of optical tweezers, electron and fluorescence microscopy. We find that scruin bundles reconstituted from acrosome fragments display an ordered structure, with a bending rigidity orders of magnitude higher than their individual filaments. Actin bundles formed by depletion exhibit similar behavior, revealing an intrinsic regime of coupled actin bundle formation. Bundle elastic moduli are eight orders of magnitude stiffer than reconstituted networks and an order of magnitude softer than the native acrosome, highlighting scruin's ability to dictate a wide range of material properties depending on the formation conditions. by Alec P.

40|$|We {{study the}} creep rupture of bundles of {{viscoelastic}} fibers occurring under uniaxial constant tensile loading. A novel fiber bundle model is introduced which combines the viscoelastic constitutive behaviour and the strain controlled breaking of fibers.

40|$|AbstractThe virtual {{hair cell}} we have {{proposed}} utilizes {{a set of}} parameters related to its mechanoelectric transduction. In this work, we observed the effect of such channel gating parameters as the gating threshold, critical tension, resting tension, and Ca 2 + concentration. The gating threshold {{is the difference between}} the resting and channel opening tension exerted by the tip link assembly on the channel. The critical tension is the tension in the tip link assembly over which the channel cannot close despite Ca 2 + binding. Our results show that 1), the gating threshold dominated the initial sensitivity of the hair cell; 2), the critical tension minimally affects the peak response, (I), but considerably affects the time course of response, I(t), and the force-displacement, F-X, relationship; and 3), higher intracellular [Ca 2 +] resulted in a smaller fast adaptation time constant. Based on the simulation results we suggest a role of the resting tension: to help overcome the viscous drag of the hair <b>bundle</b> <b>during</b> the oscillatory movement of the bundle.

However, life-threatening complications occur in a significant proportion of procedures, making TI perhaps one the most common but underappreciated airway emergencies in the ICU. In contrast to the controlled conditions in the operating room (OR), the unstable physiologic state of critically ill patients along with underevaluation of the airways and suboptimal response to pre-oxygenation are the major factors for the high incidence of life-threatening complications like severe hypoxaemia and cardiovascular collapse in the ICU. Studies have shown that strategies planned for TI in the OR can be adapted and extrapolated for use in the ICU. Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation for pre-oxygenation provides adequate oxygen stores during TI for patients with precarious respiratory pathology.

The effects of sonication intensity and time were investigated in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) and dimethylformamide (DMF). The aggregation fraction below the dispersion limit of SWNTs in the range of organic solvents was found to be influenced by the solvent parameters, particularly solvent vapor pressure and viscosity.
