5|$|As it {{had been}} two decades since much silver was {{regularly}} deposited for striking into coins, {{the fact that the}} United States had been on a <b>bimetallic</b> standard since 1792 was often forgotten. The gold standard was seen as the only possible choice, and many people assumed that the United States was on that standard, which had been adopted by strong nations like the United Kingdom (1816) and the German Empire (1871).|$|E
5|$|Because {{the most}} {{circulated}} coins in the United States {{at the time}} were Spanish currency, Hamilton proposed that minting a United States dollar weighing almost as much as the Spanish peso would be the simplest way to introduce a national currency. Hamilton differed from European monetary policymakers in his desire to overprice gold relative to silver, {{on the grounds that the}} United States would always receive an influx of silver from the West Indies. Despite his own preference for a monometallic gold standard, he ultimately issued a <b>bimetallic</b> currency at a fixed 15:1 ratio of silver to gold.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, a {{currency}} reform introduced a <b>bimetallic</b> standard, which {{went into effect}} in July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|The 1896 Democratic {{convention}} {{opened at}} the Chicago Coliseum on July 7, 1896. Much activity took place {{in advance of the}} formal opening as the silver and (vastly outnumbered) gold forces prepared their strategies. Silver forces were supported by the Democratic National <b>Bimetallic</b> Committee, the umbrella group formed in 1895 to support silver Democrats in their insurgency against Cleveland. Gold Democrats looked to the President for leadership, but Cleveland, trusting few in his party, did not involve himself further in the gold efforts, but spent the week of the convention fishing off the New Jersey coast.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury the <b>bimetallic</b> {{relationship}} between gold coins and silver coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. It is a matter of debate as whether he intended to do this or not. It has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{believed}} that the Populists' embrace of free silver would be the main issue to attract new members to the party. After the election, he attended {{a meeting of the}} American <b>Bimetallic</b> League, a pro-silver group, and gave speeches advocating an inflationist monetary policy. In the meantime, the Panic of 1893 caused bank failures, factory closures, and general economic upheaval. As the federal gold reserves dwindled, President Cleveland convinced Congress to repeal the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which ensured the government would purchase less silver for coining and which further disconcerted free silver supporters. While depletion of gold reserves slowed after the repeal, the country's economy still floundered.|$|E
5|$|In {{switching}} {{to what was}} essentially a gold standard, the United States joined a host of nations {{around the world that}} based their currencies on gold alone. But in doing so, these nations exacerbated the demand for gold as opposed to silver which, combined with more silver being mined, drove the cost of gold up and silver down. The result was not apparent immediately after the Coinage Act's passage, but by 1879 the ratio between the price of gold and that of silver had risen from 16.4:1 to 18.4:1; by 1896 it was 30:1. The ultimate effect was more expensive gold, which meant lower prices and deflation for other goods. The deflation made the effects of the Panic of 1873 worse, making it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had contracted when currency was less valuable. Farmers and laborers, especially, clamored for the return of coinage in both metals, believing the increased money supply would restore wages and property values, and the divide between pro- and anti-silver forces grew in the decades to come. Writing in 1895, Sherman defended the bill, saying that, barring some international agreement to switch the entire world to a <b>bimetallic</b> standard, the United States dollar should remain a gold-backed currency.|$|E
25|$|A nickel 10-franc {{piece was}} issued in 1986, but was quickly {{withdrawn}} and demonetized due to confusion with the half-franc and an unpopular design. This {{led to the}} conception of the later <b>bimetallic</b> model. The aluminium-bronze pieces continued to circulate until the <b>bimetallic</b> pieces were developed and additional aluminium-bronze coins were minted to replace those initially withdrawn. Once the <b>bimetallic</b> coins were circulating and produced in necessary quantities, the aluminium-bronze pieces were gradually withdrawn and demonetized.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bimetallic</b> coins are {{sometimes}} used for higher values and for commemorative purposes. In the 1990s, France used a tri-metallic coin. Common circulating <b>bimetallic</b> {{examples include the}} €1, €2, British £1, £2 and Canadian $2 and several Peso coins in Mexico.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bimetallic</b> {{mechanical}} {{or electrical}} sensors.|$|E
25|$|A direct {{indicating}} {{dial thermometer}} (such as a patio thermometer or a meat thermometer) uses a <b>bimetallic</b> strip wrapped into a coil. One {{end of the}} coil is fixed to the housing of the device and the other drives an indicating needle. A <b>bimetallic</b> strip is also used in a recording thermometer. Breguet's thermometer consists of a tri-metallic helix.|$|E
25|$|A {{circulating}} <b>bimetallic</b> two pound (£2) coin {{was introduced}} in 1998 (first minted in, and dated, 1997). There had previously been unimetallic commemorative £2 coins which did not normally circulate. This tendency to use the two pound coin for commemorative issues has continued since {{the introduction of the}} <b>bimetallic</b> coin, {{and a few of the}} older unimetallic coins have since entered circulation.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical clock {{mechanisms}} {{are sensitive to}} temperature changes which lead to errors in time keeping. A <b>bimetallic</b> strip is used to compensate for this in some mechanisms. The most common method {{is to use a}} <b>bimetallic</b> construction for the circular rim of the balance wheel. As the spring controlling the balance becomes weaker with increasing temperature, so the balance becomes smaller in diameter to keep the period of oscillation (and hence timekeeping) constant.|$|E
25|$|The first {{aluminium}} {{bascule bridge}} in the world, spanned the junction of Hendon and Hudson Docks. It suffered from <b>bimetallic</b> corrosion and was demolished in 1977.|$|E
25|$|The model {{appears to}} have been first {{proposed}} for carbon monoxide on silica-supported platinum by Brandt et al. (1993). A similar, but independent model was developed by King and co-workers to describe hydrogen adsorption on silica-supported alkali promoted ruthenium, silver-ruthenium and copper-ruthenium <b>bimetallic</b> catalysts. The same group applied the model to CO hydrogenation (Fischer–Tropsch synthesis). Zupanc et al. (2002) subsequently confirmed the same model for hydrogen adsorption on magnesia-supported caesium-ruthenium <b>bimetallic</b> catalysts. Trens et al. (2009) have similarly described CO surface diffusion on carbon-supported Pt particles of varying morphology.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury the <b>bimetallic</b> {{relationship}} between gold coins and silver coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. Due to differing valuations in other European countries this unintentionally resulted in a silver shortage, as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard, rather than the <b>bimetallic</b> standard implied by the proclamation.|$|E
25|$|On April 22, 1867, a <b>bimetallic</b> {{currency}} was adopted, {{with the}} leu equal to 5grams of 83.5% silver or 0.29032grams of gold. The first leu coin was minted in Romania in 1870.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bimetallic</b> {{strip wound}} into a coil. The {{center of the}} coil is {{attached}} to a rotating post attached to lever (1). As the coil gets colder the moving end carrying (4) moves clockwise.|$|E
25|$|Most coins closely {{resemble}} {{the size and}} shape of various euro coins. Most notably the <b>bimetallic</b> 50 qəpik (similar to €2 coin) and the 10 qəpik (Spanish flower, like the 20 euro cent coin).|$|E
25|$|Saipem now uses either {{zirconium}} stripper tubes, or <b>bimetallic</b> tubes with a titanium body (cheaper {{but less}} erosion-resistant) and a metallurgically bonded internal zirconium lining. These tubes are fabricated by ATI Wah Chang (USA) using its Omegabond technique.|$|E
25|$|The balance {{consisted}} of a circular steel balance wheel with two <b>bimetallic</b> strips attached diametrically. Each <b>bimetallic</b> strip terminated with a screw thread mounted with a weight or balance nut. The further along the strip this nut was screwed, the greater the compensating effect. Another part of the patent concerned an addition to {{the form of the}} balance spring—a coil of smaller radius {{at each end of the}} helical spring, which offered increasing resistance to the rotating balance as it turned towards the end of each vibration. This was an important invention, as it largely eliminated the problem of the positional adjustment of balance controlled watches. This device, known as the Overcoil balance spring is still used today in most precision mechanical watches.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, {{aluminium-bronze}} 200-lira coins were introduced, {{followed in}} 1982 by the <b>bimetallic</b> 500 lire. This {{was the first}} bi-metallic coin to be produced for circulation, minted using a system patented by IPZS. It {{was also the first}} to feature the value in braille.|$|E
25|$|In 1775, Arnold {{took out}} a patent for {{a new form of}} {{compensation}} balance with a <b>bimetallic</b> spiral at the centre. This spiral actuated two weighted arms, making them move in and out from the centre, changing the radius of gyration, and thus the period of oscillation.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, a {{new series}} of coins was {{introduced}} consisting of , , 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 dinars. A 200 dinar bi-metallic coin was issued in 2012 to commemorate Algeria's 50th anniversary of independence. The 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 dinar coins are <b>bimetallic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nickel-clad {{copper-nickel}} 5-franc and nickel-brass 10-franc coins replaced their silver {{counterparts in}} 1970 and 1974, respectively. Nickel 2 francs were finally introduced in 1979, followed by <b>bimetallic</b> 10 francs in 1988 and trimetallic 20 francs in 1992. The 20-franc coin {{was composed of}} two rings and a centre plug.|$|E
25|$|Most {{economic}} historians {{see this}} period as negative {{for the most}} industrial nations. Many argue {{that most of the}} stagnation was caused by a monetary contraction caused by abandonment of the <b>bimetallic</b> standard, for a new fiat gold standard, starting with the Coinage Act of 1873.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, cupronickel 5 baht coins were introduced, {{switching}} to cupronickel-clad copper in 1977. Between 1986 and 1988, a new coinage was introduced, consisting of aluminium 1, 5, and 10 satang, aluminium-bronze 25 and 50 satang, cupronickel 1 baht, cupronickel-clad-copper 5 baht and <b>bimetallic</b> 10 baht. Cupronickel-clad-steel 2 baht {{were introduced in}} 2005.|$|E
25|$|Brass 10, 20 and 50 avos and {{cupro-nickel}} 1 and 5 patacas {{were introduced}} in 1982. The 20 avos and 5 patacas became dodecagonal in 1993 and 1992, respectively, whilst a <b>bimetallic</b> 10 patacas was introduced in 1997 and a cupronickel 2 patacas in 1998. Coins are issued by the Monetary Authority of Macau.|$|E
25|$|Ciampi {{chose the}} Vitruvian man of Leonardo da Vinci, on the {{symbolic}} {{grounds that it}} represented man {{as a measure of}} all things, and in particular of the coin: in this perspective, money was at the service of man, instead of its opposite. The design also fitted very well on the <b>bimetallic</b> material of the coin.|$|E
25|$|Coins were {{introduced}} in 2005 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 new (Yeni) kuruş and 1 new (Yeni) lira. The 1 new (Yeni) kuruş was minted in brass and the 5, 10 and 25 new kuruş in cupro-nickel, whilst the 50 new kuruş and 1 new lira are <b>bimetallic.</b> All coins show portraits of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.|$|E
25|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{redesigning}} the coin was to combat counterfeiting. As of March 2014 there were an estimated 1,553 million of the original nickel-brass coins in circulation, of which the Royal Mint estimated in 2014 that just over 3% were counterfeit. The new coin, in contrast, is <b>bimetallic</b> like the current £2 coin, and features an undisclosed hidden security feature called 'iSIS' (Integrated Secure Identification Systems).|$|E
25|$|This {{surviving}} watch {{dates from}} around 1769-1770, and is signed Arnold No. 1 Invenit et Fecit. The movement, which indicates centre seconds, has a steel balance with a <b>bimetallic</b> temperature compensation strip that acts {{on the flat}} balance spring. Though now altered, the original escapement was Arnold's horizontal pivoted detent as fitted to the larger timekeepers, which was it seems not entirely successful and needed improvements.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, coins were {{introduced}} in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 fils. The 1, 5 and 10 fils were struck in bronze, with the others in cupro-nickel. The 1 fils coin was not produced after 1966 and no longer circulates. A <b>bimetallic</b> 100 fils coin was introduced in October 1977. In 1992, brass replaced bronze in the 5 and 10 fils.|$|E
25|$|National Economic Security and Recovery Act (NESARA) {{was a set}} of {{proposed}} economic reforms suggested during the 1990s by Harvey Francis Barnard. Barnard claimed that the proposals, which included replacing the income tax with a national sales tax, abolishing compound interest on secured loans, and returning to a <b>bimetallic</b> currency, would result in 0% inflation and a more stable economy. The proposals were never introduced before Congress.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{thermostat}} control {{was developed in}} the 1830s by Andrew Ure (1778–1857), a Scottish chemist, who invented the bi-metallic thermostat. The textile mills of the time needed a constant and steady temperature to operate optimally, so to achieve this Ure designed the <b>bimetallic</b> thermostat, which would bend as one of the metals expanded in response to the increased temperature and cut off the energy supply.|$|E
25|$|In the {{regulation}} of heating and cooling, thermostats that operate {{over a wide range}} of temperatures are used. In these, one end of the <b>bimetallic</b> strip is mechanically fixed and attached to an electrical power source, while the other (moving) end carries an electrical contact. In adjustable thermostats another contact is positioned with a regulating knob or lever. The position so set controls the regulated temperature, called the set point.|$|E
