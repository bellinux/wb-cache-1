5|$|There {{are four}} primary levels of care; routine home care, {{continuous}} care, general inpatient and respite/respite inpatient. All hospices in the United States certified <b>by</b> <b>Medicare</b> {{are required to}} offer each of these levels of care.|$|E
5|$|The hospice team is {{required}} <b>by</b> <b>Medicare</b> to meet every 14 days. During this team meeting, patient needs are discussed and {{planned for the}} next two weeks. Additionally, the team reviews the patient's medical condition to ensure that the patient still meets criteria for hospice care.|$|E
5|$|Counselor: Counselors are {{required}} {{as part of}} the core team <b>by</b> <b>Medicare</b> regulations. Typically, the role is filled by a Chaplain or Spiritual Counselor, but social workers or other persons, sometimes specially trained, may also serve. While not every patient will see a Chaplain on hospice, all hospices {{have to be able to}} provide regular and consistent Chaplain services. The Chaplain is available to provide spiritually supportive counseling, life review and may connect a patient with clergy they are comfortable with. At times the hospice Chaplain will officiate at a patient's funeral.|$|E
50|$|Providing {{psychology}} {{services to}} older adults was historically curtailed <b>by</b> <b>Medicare’s</b> limited coverage {{of mental health}} services. Barriers specific to psychological services were caused <b>by</b> <b>Medicare’s</b> provider restrictions, which did not allow reimbursement to psychologists until 1988. In addition, prior to 1988, Medicare capped reimbursement for all mental health outpatient services at $250 annually. The annual cap on outpatient mental health care was increased in 1988 and 1989, and then eliminated in 1990.|$|R

5|$|Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a {{force behind}} {{the passage of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to {{children}} whose parents could not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law. She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided <b>by</b> <b>Medicare.</b> She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Care may be {{provided}} in a patient's {{home or in}} a designated facility, such as a nursing home, hospital unit or freestanding hospice, with level of care and sometimes location based upon frequent evaluation of the patient's needs. The four primary levels of care provided by hospice are routine home care, continuous care, general inpatient, and respite care. Patients undergoing hospice treatment may be discharged {{for a number of}} reasons, including improvement of their condition and refusal to cooperate with providers, but may return to hospice care as their circumstances change. Providers are required <b>by</b> <b>Medicare</b> to provide to patients notice of pending discharge, which they may appeal.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{hospice care}} may {{be met by}} health {{insurance}} providers, including Medicare or Medicaid for eligible Americans. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible <b>by</b> <b>Medicare</b> Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and respite care, if needed. (Respite care may be necessary, for instance, if a family member who is providing home hospice care is briefly unable to perform his or her duties and an alternative care provider becomes necessary.) As of 2008, Medicare was responsible for around 80% of hospice payments, reimbursing providers differently from county to county with a higher rate for inpatient hospice care. A lower rate is paid for home care, with a higher rate paid for round-the-clock nursing care {{in order to get}} a patient's symptoms under control.|$|E

25|$|Hospice {{benefits}} are also provided under Part A of Medicare for terminally ill persons {{with less than}} six months to live, as determined by the patient's physician. The terminally ill person must sign a statement that hospice care has been chosen over other Medicare-covered benefits, (e.g. assisted living or hospital care). Treatment provided includes pharmaceutical products for symptom control and pain relief as well as other services not otherwise covered <b>by</b> <b>Medicare</b> such as grief counseling.

25|$|Norfolk Island Hospital is {{the only}} medical centre on the island. From 1 July 2016, medical {{treatment}} on Norfolk Island is covered <b>by</b> <b>Medicare</b> and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme {{as it is on}} mainland Australia. Emergency medical treatment is covered <b>by</b> <b>Medicare</b> or a private health insurer. Although the hospital can perform minor surgery, serious medical conditions are not permitted to be treated on the island and patients are flown back to mainland Australia. Air charter transport can cost in the order of A$30,000, which is covered by the Australian Government. For serious emergencies, medical evacuations are provided by the Royal Australian Air Force. The island has one ambulance, staffed by St John Ambulance Australia volunteers.|$|E
25|$|Parts B and D are {{partially}} {{funded by}} premiums paid <b>by</b> <b>Medicare</b> enrollees and general fund revenue.

25|$|The {{funding of}} {{healthcare}} in Australia <b>by</b> <b>Medicare</b> {{is referred to}} as a rebate or benefit. The difference between the cost of healthcare and the rebate is called an out-of-pocket cost. The out-of-pocket costs for Australians are continuing to increase, as a result of increases in healthcare costs above Medicare schedule increases, and also because a Medicare benefits freeze has been imposed over the last few years. Medical practitioners choosing to cease or cut back on bulk-billing also increases out-of-pocket costs to patients.|$|E
25|$|Donnelly, {{along with}} 197 {{members of the}} House, was a cosponsor of the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007. Requiring federal {{officials}} to negotiate with prescription drug companies for lower prices for seniors covered <b>by</b> <b>Medicare</b> Part D, repealing the original text of Medicare Part D, banning the government to negotiate with prescription drug companies. Donnelly has voted against the Prescription Drug Imports Act, allowing imports of Prescription Drugs from FDA inspected plants in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and European countries.|$|E
25|$|Medicare Australia {{provides}} {{cover for}} many of the major surgeries needed for SRS (sex reassignment surgery). However, there can often be a gap between the Medicare benefit paid and the amount the surgeon will charge, sometimes in the amount of thousands of dollars. However many Australian private health insurance policies provide private hospital cover policy that includes any SRS procedure that is also covered <b>by</b> <b>Medicare.</b> There is typically a waiting period before insurers allow people to claim for these services, usually about 12 months.|$|E

25|$|The first 20 {{days would}} be paid for in full <b>by</b> <b>Medicare</b> with the {{remaining}} 80 days requiring a co-payment of $161 per day as of 2016. Many insurance group retiree, Medigap and Part C insurance plans have a provision for additional coverage of skilled nursing care in the policies they sell. If a beneficiary uses some portion of their Part A benefit and then goes at least 60 days without receiving facility-based skilled services, the 90-day hospital clock and 100-day nursing home clock are reset and the person qualifies for new benefit periods.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, adverse medical event {{reporting}} systems were mandated {{in just over}} half (27) of the states as of 2014, a figure unchanged since 2007. In U.S. hospitals error reporting is a condition of payment <b>by</b> <b>Medicare.</b> An investigation by the Office of Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services released January 6, 2012 found that most errors are not reported {{and even in the}} case of errors that are reported and investigated changes are seldom made which would prevent them in the future. The investigation revealed that there was often lack of knowledge regarding which events were reportable and recommended that lists of reportable events be developed.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 {{follow-up}} to the IOM {{study found that}} medication errors {{are among the most}} common medical mistakes, harming at least 1.5 million people every year. According to the study, 400,000 preventable drug-related injuries occur each year in hospitals, 800,000 in long-term care settings, and roughly 530,000 among Medicare recipients in outpatient clinics. The report stated that these are likely to be conservative estimates. In 2000 alone, the extra medical costs incurred by preventable drug-related injuries approximated $887 millionand the study looked only at injuries sustained <b>by</b> <b>Medicare</b> recipients, a subset of clinic visitors. None of these figures take into account lost wages and productivity or other costs.|$|E

30|$|Low {{adherence}} to comorbidity medication {{was reported by}} 29.5 % of patients (Table 1).

There were no differences in comorbidity medication adherence levels by cancer type.|$|R
25|$|Other {{advantages}} of the NPT approach are that it is fast and convenient, usually less painful, and offers, in home use, the ability for patients to measure their own INRs when required. Among its problems are that quite a steady hand is needed to deliver the blood to the exact spot, that some patients find the finger-pricking difficult, and {{that the cost of}} the test strips must also be taken into account. In the UK these are available on prescription so that elderly and unwaged people will not pay for them and others will pay only a standard prescription charge, which at the moment represents only about 20% of the retail price of the strips. In the USA, NPT in the home is currently reimbursed <b>by</b> <b>Medicare</b> for patients with mechanical heart valves, while private insurers may cover for other indications. Medicare is now covering home testing for patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. Home testing requires a doctor's prescription and that the meter and supplies are obtained from a Medicare approved Independent Diagnostic Testing Facility (IDTF).|$|E
25|$|Due to glycated hemoglobin's {{variability}} (as {{shown in}} the table above), additional measures should be checked in patients at or near recommended goals. People with HbA1c values at 64mmol/mol or less should be provided additional testing {{to determine whether the}} HbA1c values are due to averaging out high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) with low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) or the HbA1c is more reflective of an elevated blood glucose that does not vary much throughout the day. Devices such as continuous blood glucose monitoring allow people with diabetes to determine their blood glucose levels on a continuous basis, testing every few minutes. Continuous use of blood glucose monitors is becoming more common, and the devices are covered by many health insurance plans but not <b>by</b> <b>Medicare</b> in the United States. The supplies tend to be expensive, since the sensors must be changed at least weekly. Another test that is useful in determining if HbA1c values are due to wide variations of blood glucose throughout the day is 1,5 Anhydroglucitol, also known as GlycoMark. GlycoMark reflects only the times that the person experiences hyperglycemia above 180mg/dL over a two-week period.|$|E
25|$|Medicaid {{is a joint}} {{federal and}} state program that helps with medical costs for about 74 million people (as of 2017) with limited income and resources. Medicaid also offers {{benefits}} not normally covered <b>by</b> <b>Medicare,</b> like nursing home care and personal care services. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with low income in the United States, providing free health insurance to low-income and disabled people. It is a means-tested program that is jointly funded {{by the state and}} federal governments and managed by the states, with each state currently having broad leeway to determine who is eligible for its implementation of the program. States are not required to participate in the program, although all have since 1982. Medicaid recipients must be U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, and may include low-income adults, their children, and people with certain disabilities. Poverty alone does not necessarily qualify someone for Medicaid. The Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), the percent of Medicaid program costs covered by the federal government, ranges from 50% for higher-income states to 75% for states with lower per-capita incomes.|$|E
