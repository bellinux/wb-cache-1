5|$|In the High Court case of Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989), the {{plaintiff}} {{argued that the}} 1989 amendments to the Constitution had violated the <b>basic</b> <b>features</b> of the Constitution by breaching the principle of separation of powers by usurping judicial power, and contravening the rule of law. The Court rejected {{the application of the}} <b>basic</b> <b>features</b> doctrine owing to the differences in the making of the Singapore Constitution and the Indian Constitution, {{and the fact that the}} framers of the Singapore Constitution had not expressly provided for limitations to be placed on Parliament's power of amendment. The Court also held that, in any case, there had been no violation of the Constitution's <b>basic</b> <b>features</b> on the facts of the case. On appeal, the Court of Appeal determined the case on other grounds, and thus found it unnecessary to decide conclusively if the <b>basic</b> <b>features</b> doctrine applies in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|The game {{opens with}} a group of Magnemite—magnet-like Pokémon with {{levitation}} abilities—delivering a television to the player's house. Upon turning the television on, Professor Oak appears to request the player's help: he is creating a new television network for Trainers and their Pokémon to enjoy together, and he wants the player to serve as a beta tester. He has them watch an episode of an anime called Pichu Bros. and then introduces the game's <b>basic</b> <b>features</b> before leaving them alone. The player then hears Pokémon cries from outside, which turn out to belong to a Pikachu and two other creatures: the reptilian Treecko and the avian Torchic. While the others run off, the Pikachu stays and the player adopts it. Oak decides to allow Pikachu to be a second beta tester.|$|E

5|$|The term {{track and}} field is {{intertwined}} with the stadiums that first hosted such competitions. The two <b>basic</b> <b>features</b> of a {{track and field}} stadium are the outer oval-shaped running track and an area of turf within this track—the field. In earlier competitions, track lengths varied: the Panathinaiko Stadium measured 333.33metres at the 1896 Summer Olympics, while at the 1904 Olympics the distance was {{a third of a}} mile (536.45m) at Francis Field. As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for the lanes were established, as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track. Tracks made of flattened cinders were popular in the early 20th century but synthetic tracks became standard in the late 1960s. 3M's Tartan track (an all-weather running track of polyurethane) gained popularity after its use at the 1968 US Olympic Trials and the 1968 Summer Olympics and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport. Many track and field stadiums are multi-purpose stadiums, with the running track surrounding a field built for other sports, such as the various types of football.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{structure}} or <b>basic</b> <b>features</b> doctrine holds {{that there is}} an implied restriction on the powers of the legislature to amend the Constitution: it is precluded from amending the <b>basic</b> <b>features</b> of the Constitution. The landmark case of Kesavananda Bharati established that the doctrine applies in India, highlighting that while Parliament's power to amend the Constitution extends to all its sections, essential features of the Constitution must not be altered.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, the {{rejection}} of the <b>basic</b> <b>features</b> doctrine may have paved the way for fundamental changes to be made to the Singapore Constitution over the years, including the introduction of Group Representation Constituencies, Non-constituency Members of Parliament, Nominated Members of Parliament and the Elected President. Such changes may not have happened or may have faced the possibility of being pronounced unconstitutional by the courts if the <b>basic</b> <b>features</b> doctrine was applicable in Singapore.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Justice Ajit Nath Ray dissented and gave reasons for rejecting the <b>basic</b> <b>features</b> doctrine. He stated {{that since the}} Constitution {{is the source of}} all legal {{validity}} and is itself always valid, a constitutional amendment, being part of the Constitution itself, will also always be valid. The power to amend the Constitution is wide and unlimited, and there is neither a distinction nor any possibility of a difference between essential and non-essential features of the Constitution that may impede amendment. In fact, if Parliament's power to amend is extinguished because of essential features that are not expressly defined in the Constitution, the courts would be creating a new constitution. Justice Ray presented other problems of the <b>basic</b> <b>features</b> doctrine, criticizing it as being uncertain in scope. Without an evident definition of what the <b>basic</b> <b>features</b> are, the task of trying to amend the Constitution becomes unpredictable. In his view, all the provisions of the Constitution are essential but this does not prohibit them from being amendable.|$|E

30|$|In addition, the {{proposed}} method has one underlying {{requirement for the}} basic feature: it should have a good-enough recognition performance. For two features, different feature orders in fusion will result in different recognition performances. The main {{reason is that the}} <b>basic</b> <b>feature</b> {{plays an important role in}} {{the proposed}} method, which should meet the above requirement. If the <b>basic</b> <b>feature</b> has poor recognition performance, it will be very hard to achieve a promising performance. The proposed method has only tested on Gabor and SURF features. Whether other features are effective depends on whether the <b>basic</b> and minor <b>features</b> complement each other. Further tests are required for using other features.|$|R
