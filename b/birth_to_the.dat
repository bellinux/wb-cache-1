40|$|The {{acculturation}} {{effect of}} immigrant women on birth outcomes varies by race. We examined birth outcomes of {{three groups of}} births for the period 1995 - 2004, USA <b>births</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> USA-born Korean mothers, USA <b>births</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> non-USA-born Korean mothers, and births in Korea. In singleton USA <b>births</b> <b>to</b> both Korean parents, average birth weight was 3, 294 g for the USA-born Korean mothers and 3, 323 g for the non-USA-born Korean mothers. However, this difference was not significant, once controlled for other maternal sociodemographic, obstetric and medical factors. Low birth weight and prematurity prevalence were not different by maternal nativity between these two singleton groups. Average birth weight of all births including multiplets in Korea was 3, 270 g, compared to 3, 297 g for all USA-born infants including multiplets and <b>births</b> either <b>to</b> both or one Korean parents. This difference might have reflected a significantly lower educational attainment of mothers in Korea compared to Korean mothers in the USA. Low birth weight rate was consistently lower in infants born in Korea compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> USA-born, but this difference became less, 4. 2 % and 4. 6 % respectively by 2004. These observations suggest that in the USA acculturation effect of Korean immigrants on birth outcomes is negligible...|$|R
