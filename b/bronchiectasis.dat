5|$|Asthma, chronic bronchitis, <b>bronchiectasis</b> {{and chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits {{the amount of}} air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and emphysema is smoking, and common causes of <b>bronchiectasis</b> include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|If left untreated, DPB {{progresses}} to <b>bronchiectasis,</b> an irreversible {{lung condition}} that involves {{enlargement of the}} bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the bronchiolar passages. Daily treatment of DPB with macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin eases symptoms and increases survival time, but the disease currently has no known cure. The eventual result of DPB can be respiratory failure and heart problems.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} TBI who die do so {{within minutes of}} the injury, due to {{complications}} such as pneumothorax and insufficient airway and to other injuries that occurred at the same time. Most late deaths that occur in TBI are attributed to sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). If the condition is not recognized and treated early, serious complications {{are more likely to}} occur; for example, pneumonia and <b>bronchiectasis</b> may occur as late complications. Years can pass before the condition is recognized. Some TBI are so small {{that they do not have}} significant clinical manifestations; they may never be noticed or diagnosed and may heal without intervention.|$|E
5|$|Untreated DPB {{leads to}} <b>bronchiectasis,</b> {{respiratory}} failure, and death. A journal report from 1983 indicated that untreated DPB had a five-year survival rate of 62.1%, while the 10-year survival rate was 33.2%. With erythromycin treatment, individuals with DPB {{now have a}} much longer life expectancy due to better management of symptoms, delay of progression, and prevention of associated infections like P.aeruginosa. The 10-year survival rate for treated DPB is about 90%. In DPB cases where treatment has resulted in significant improvement, which sometimes happens after about two years, treatment {{has been allowed to}} end for a while. However, individuals allowed to stop treatment during this time are closely monitored. As DPB has been proven to recur, erythromycin therapy must be promptly resumed once disease symptoms begin to reappear. In spite of the improved prognosis when treated, DPB currently has no known cure.|$|E
5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected lung tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause <b>bronchiectasis,</b> in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E
25|$|When utilising high {{resolution}} CT scans, {{there can be}} better assessment of the distribution and pattern of <b>bronchiectasis</b> within the lungs, and hence this is the tool of choice in the radiological diagnosis of ABPA. Central (confined to medial two-thirds of medial half of the lung) <b>bronchiectasis</b> that peripherally tapers bronchi is considered a requirement for ABPA pathophysiology, though in up to 43% of cases there is considerable extension to {{the periphery of the}} lung.|$|E
25|$|Exophiala dermatitidis forms {{neurotrophic}} infections, and is {{the black}} yeast that most commonly causes life-threatening phaeohyphomycosis. Conditions that might predispose people towards an invasive opportunistic infection include diabetes mellitus, lymphocytic leukemia, <b>bronchiectasis,</b> rheumatoid arthritis, and catheterization. Systemic infections are often reported to be without cutaneous or subcutaneous involvement.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, Carl von Rokitansky {{described}} {{a case of}} fetal death with meconium peritonitis, a complication of meconium ileus associated with CF. Meconium ileus was first described in 1905 by Karl Landsteiner. In 1936, Guido Fanconi {{described a}} connection between celiac disease, cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, and <b>bronchiectasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mucoid {{impaction}} of {{the upper}} and lower airways is a common finding. Plugs are hypodense but appear on CT with high attenuation (over 70 Hounsfield units) in up to 20% of patients. Where present it is a strong diagnostic factor of ABPA and distinguishes symptoms from other causes of <b>bronchiectasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{typically}} {{based on a}} person's signs and symptoms. The color of the sputum does not indicate if the infection is viral or bacterial. Determining the underlying organism {{is typically}} not needed. Other causes of similar symptoms include asthma, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, <b>bronchiectasis,</b> and COPD. A chest X-ray {{may be useful to}} detect pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|As {{concentrations}} of Aspergillus proteases increase, the immunological effect switches from pro-inflammatory to inhibitory, and further reduces phagocytic ability to clear Aspergillus. Ultimately, repeated acute episodes lead to wider scale damage of pulmonary structures (parenchyma) and function via irreversible lung remodelling. Left untreated, this manifests as progressive <b>bronchiectasis</b> and pulmonary fibrosis {{that is often}} seen in the upper lobes, and can {{give rise to a}} similar radiological appearance to that produced by tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|Almost all {{patients}} have clinically diagnosed asthma, and present with wheezing (usually episodic in nature), coughing, {{shortness of breath}} and exercise intolerance (especially in patients with cystic fibrosis). Moderate and severe cases have symptoms suggestive of <b>bronchiectasis,</b> in particular thick sputum production (often containing brown mucus plugs), as well as symptoms mirroring recurrent infection such as pleuritic chest pain and fever. Patients with asthma and symptoms of ongoing infection, who {{do not respond to}} antibiotic treatment, should be suspected of ABPA.|$|E
25|$|Lewis Balfour and his {{daughter}} both had weak chests, so they often needed to stay in warmer climates for their health. Stevenson inherited a tendency to coughs and fevers, exacerbated when {{the family moved to}} a damp, chilly house at 1Inverleith Terrace in1851. The family moved again to the sunnier 17Heriot Row when Stevenson was six years old, but the tendency to extreme sickness in winter remained with him until he was eleven. Illness would be a recurrent feature of his adult life and left him extraordinarily thin. Contemporary views were that he had tuberculosis, but more recent views are that it was <b>bronchiectasis</b> or even sarcoidosis.|$|E
25|$|About 25% of {{individuals}} with situs inversus have an underlying condition known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is a dysfunction of the cilia that manifests itself during the embryologic phase of development. Normally functioning cilia determine {{the position of the}} internal organs during early embryological development, and so embryos with PCD have a 50% chance of developing situs inversus. If they do, they are said to have Kartagener syndrome, characterized by the triad of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and <b>bronchiectasis.</b> Cilia are also responsible for clearing mucus from the lung, and the dysfunction causes increased susceptibility to lung infections. Kartagener syndrome can also manifest with male infertility as functional cilia are required for proper sperm flagella function.|$|E
25|$|Medicare penalizes {{hospitals}} for readmissions. After making initial payments for hospital stays, Medicare will take {{back from the}} hospital these payments, plus a penalty of 4 to 18 times the initial payment, if an above-average number of patients from the hospital are readmitted within 30 days. These readmission penalties apply after {{some of the most}} common treatments: pneumonia, heart failure, heart attack, COPD, knee replacement, hip replacement. A study of 18 states conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that 1.8 million Medicare patients aged 65 and older were readmitted within 30 days of an initial hospital stay in 2011; the conditions with the highest readmission rates were congestive heart failure, septicemia, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and <b>bronchiectasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In later stages, {{changes in}} the {{architecture}} of the lung, such as pathology in the major airways (<b>bronchiectasis),</b> further exacerbate difficulties in breathing. Other signs include coughing up blood (hemoptysis), high blood pressure in the lung (pulmonary hypertension), heart failure, difficulties getting enough oxygen to the body (hypoxia), and respiratory failure requiring support with breathing masks, such as bilevel positive airway pressure machines or ventilators. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the three most common organisms causing lung infections in CF patients. In addition to typical bacterial infections, people with CF more commonly develop other types of lung disease. Among these is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, in which the body's response to the common fungus Aspergillus fumigatus causes worsening of breathing problems. Another is infection with Mycobacterium avium complex, a group of bacteria related to tuberculosis, which can cause lung damage and does not respond to common antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, {{while in}} {{hospital}} {{for the removal of}} her tonsils, Svetlana met Kunwar Brajesh Singh, an Indian Communist from the Kalakankar Rajput Zamindar family visiting Moscow. The two fell in love. Singh was mild-mannered and highly educated but gravely ill with <b>bronchiectasis</b> and emphysema. The relationship grew deeper and stronger still while the couple were recuperating in Sochi beside the Black Sea. Singh returned to Moscow in 1965 to work as a translator, but he and Svetlana were not allowed to marry. The following year, 1966, he died. She was allowed to travel to India to take his ashes to his family to pour into the Ganges. She stayed in the family home in Kalakankar {{on the banks of the}} Ganges for three months and became immersed in local customs, leading to her abandonment of atheism. In an interview on 26 April 1967, she referred to Singh as her husband but also stated that they were never allowed to marry officially.|$|E
25|$|Recurrent sinus {{and lung}} infections {{can lead to}} the {{development}} of chronic lung disease. Such infections should be treated with appropriate antibiotics to prevent and limit lung injury. Administration of antibiotics should be considered when children and adults have prolonged respiratory symptoms (greater than 7 days), even following what was presumed to have been a viral infection. To help prevent respiratory illnesses from common respiratory pathogens, annual influenza vaccinations should be given and pneumococcal vaccines should be administered when appropriate. Antibiotic treatment should also be considered in children with chronic coughs that are productive of mucous, those who do not respond to aggressive pulmonary clearance techniques and in children with muco-purulent secretions from the sinuses or chest. A wet cough can also be associated with chronic aspiration which should be ruled out through proper diagnostic studies, however aspiration and respiratory infections are not necessarily exclusive of each other. In children and adults with <b>bronchiectasis,</b> chronic antibiotic therapy should be considered to slow chronic lung disease progression.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{lung disease}} {{develops}} {{in more than}} 25% of people with A-T. Three major types of lung disease can develop: (1) recurrent and chronic sinopulmonary infections; (2) lung disease caused by ineffective cough, swallowing dysfunction, and impaired airway clearance; and (3) restrictive interstitial lung disease. It is common for individuals with A-T {{to have more than}} one of these lung conditions. Chronic lung disease can occur because of recurrent lung infections due to immunodeficiency. Individuals with this problem are at risk of developing <b>bronchiectasis,</b> a condition in which bronchial tubes are permanently damaged, resulting in recurrent lower airway infections. Gamma globulin for people with antibody deficiency and/or chronic antibiotic treatment may reduce the problems of infection. Other individuals with A-T have difficulty with taking deep breaths and may have an ineffective cough, making it difficult to clear oral and bronchial secretions. This can lead to prolonged respiratory symptoms following common viral respiratory illnesses. Techniques that allow clearance of mucus can be helpful in some individuals during respiratory illnesses. Some people will develop swallowing problems as they age, increasing their risk of aspiration pneumonia. Recurrent injury to the lungs caused by chronic infections or aspiration may cause lung fibrosis and scarring. This process may be enhanced by inadequate tissue repair in ATM-deficient cells. A small number of individuals develop interstitial lung disease. They have decreased pulmonary reserve, trouble breathing, a need for supplemental oxygen and chronic cough in the absence of lung infections. They may respond to systemic steroid treatment or other drugs to reduce inflammation.|$|E
500|$|Symptoms of DPB include chronic {{sinusitis}} (inflamed paranasal sinuses), wheezing, crackles (respiratory sounds made by obstructions such as phlegm and secretions in the lungs), dyspnea (shortness of breath), and a severe cough that yields {{large amounts of}} sputum (coughed-up phlegm). There may be pus in the sputum, and affected individuals may have fever. Typical signs of DPB progression include [...] (enlargement) of the bronchiolar passages and hypoxemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood). If DPB is left untreated, <b>bronchiectasis</b> will occur; it is characterized by dilation and thickening of {{the walls of the}} bronchioles, inflammatory damage to respiratory and terminal bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the lungs. DPB is associated with progressive respiratory failure, hypercapnia (increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood), and can eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary vein and artery) and cor pulmonale (dilation of the right ventricle of the heart, or [...] "right heart failure").|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, Lee {{wrote that}} he was {{discharged}} from Korea's mandatory military service due to a diagnosis of acute <b>bronchiectasis</b> while at the Nonsan Training Facility.|$|E
2500|$|He {{died at the}} age of 70, on December 29, 1919 in Oxford, {{during the}} Spanish {{influenza}} epidemic, most likely of complications from undiagnosed <b>bronchiectasis.</b> His wife, Grace, lived another nine years but succumbed to a series of strokes. Sir William and Lady Osler's ashes now rest in a niche in the Osler Library at McGill University. They had two sons, one of whom died shortly after birth. [...] The other, Edward Revere Osler, was mortally wounded in combat in World War I at the age of 21, during the 3rd battle of Ypres (also known as the battle of Passchendaele). At the time of his death in August 1917, he was a second lieutenant in the (British) Royal Field Artillery; Lt. Osler's grave is in the Dozinghem Military Cemetery in West Flanders, Belgium. According to one biographer, Osler was emotionally crushed by the loss; he was particularly anguished by the fact that his influence had been used to procure a military commission for his son, who had mediocre eyesight. Lady Osler (Grace Revere) was born in Boston in 1854; her paternal great-grandfather was Paul Revere. In 1876, she married Samuel W. Gross, chairman of surgery at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. Gross died in 1889 and in 1892 she married William Osler who was then professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bronchiectasis</b> {{refers to}} the abnormal, {{irreversible}} dilatation of the bronchi caused by destructive and inflammatory changes in the airway walls. <b>Bronchiectasis</b> has three major anatomical patterns: cylindrical <b>bronchiectasis,</b> varicose <b>bronchiectasis</b> and cystic <b>bronchiectasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Bronchiectasis</b> {{has both}} {{congenital}} and acquired causes, {{with the latter}} more frequent. Cystic fibrosis is a cause in {{up to half of}} cases. The cause in 10-50% of those without cystic fibrosis is unknown; <b>bronchiectasis</b> without CF is known as non-CF <b>bronchiectasis</b> (NCBE).|$|E
5000|$|Some {{people with}} <b>bronchiectasis</b> {{may have a}} cough {{productive}} of frequent green/yellow mucus (sputum), up to 240 ml (8 oz) daily. <b>Bronchiectasis</b> may also present with coughing up blood (hemoptysis) {{in the absence of}} sputum, called [...] "dry bronchiectasis". Sputum production may also occur without coloration. People with <b>bronchiectasis</b> may have bad breath indicative of active infection. Frequent bronchial infections and breathlessness are two possible indicators of <b>bronchiectasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other—Any other finding {{suggestive of}} prior TB, such as upper lobe <b>bronchiectasis.</b> <b>Bronchiectasis</b> is {{bronchial}} dilation with bronchial wall thickening.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bronchiectasis</b> {{may result}} from {{congenital}} disorders that affect cilia motility or ion transport. Kartagener syndrome is one such disorder of cilia motility linked {{to the development of}} <b>bronchiectasis.</b> A common cause is cystic fibrosis, which affects chloride ion transport, in which a small number of patients develop severe localized <b>bronchiectasis.</b> Young's syndrome, which is clinically similar to cystic fibrosis, is thought to significantly {{contribute to the development of}} <b>bronchiectasis.</b> This is due to the occurrence of chronic infections of the sinuses and bronchiole tree.|$|E
50|$|Endobronchial {{tuberculosis}} commonly {{leads to}} <b>bronchiectasis,</b> either from bronchial stenosis or secondary traction from fibrosis. Traction <b>bronchiectasis</b> characteristically affects peripheral bronchi (which lack cartilage support) {{in areas of}} end-stage fibrosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bronchiectasis</b> may be {{diagnosed}} clinically or on review of imaging. The British Thoracic Society recommends all non cystic-fibrosis-related <b>bronchiectasis</b> {{be confirmed by}} CT. CT may reveal tree-in-bud abnormalities, dilated bronchi, and cysts with defined borders.|$|E
50|$|Tuberculosis, pneumonia, inhaled foreign bodies, {{allergic}} bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bronchial tumours are {{the major}} acquired causes of <b>bronchiectasis.</b> Infective causes associated with <b>bronchiectasis</b> include infections caused by the Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, or Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough and nontuberculous mycobacteria.|$|E
