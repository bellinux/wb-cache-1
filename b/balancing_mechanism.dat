500|$|Many of Rupert's inventions were military. After {{designing}} the Rupertinoe naval gun, Rupert erected a water-mill on Hackney Marshes for a revolutionary method of boring guns, however his secret died with him, and the enterprise failed. Rupert enjoyed other military problems, and took to manufacturing gun locks; he devised both a gun that fired multiple rounds at high speed, and a [...] "handgun with rotating barrels". He {{is credited with}} the invention of a form of gunpowder, which when demonstrated to the Royal Society in 1663 had a force of over ten times that of regular powder; a better method for using gunpowder in mining; and a torpedo. He also developed a form of grapeshot for use by artillery. Rupert also focussed on naval inventions: he devised a <b>balancing</b> <b>mechanism</b> to allow improved quadrant measurements at sea, and produced a diving engine for retrieving objects on the ocean floor. While recovering from his trepanning treatment Rupert set about inventing new surgical equipment to improve future operations.|$|E
500|$|Scientists {{began to}} debate the {{function}} of the American paddlefish's rostrum when the species was described in the late 1700s. They had once believed it was used to excavate bottom substrate or functioned as a <b>balancing</b> <b>mechanism</b> and navigational aid. However, laboratory experiments in 1993 that utilized advanced technology in the field of electron microscopy have established conclusively that the rostrum of American paddlefish is covered {{with tens of thousands of}} sensory receptors. [...] These receptors are morphologically similar to the ampullae of Lorenzini of sharks and rays, and are indeed passive ampullary-type electroreceptors used by American paddlefish to detect plankton. [...] Clusters of electroreceptors also cover the head and operculum flaps. The American paddlefish's diet consists primarily of zooplankton. Their electroreceptors can detect weak electrical fields, which signal not only the presence of zooplankton, but also the individual feeding and swimming movements of zooplankton appendages. When a swarm of zooplankton is detected, the paddlefish swims forward continuously with their mouth wide open, forcing water over the gill rakers to filter out prey. Such feeding behavior is considered ram suspension-feeding. Further research has indicated that their electroreceptors may also serve as a navigational aid for obstacle avoidance.|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanism}} or robotic manipulator that is dynamically balanced {{does not}} cause base vibrations when moving at high speeds. A <b>balanced</b> <b>mechanism</b> does not perturb equipment mounted on the same base, the floor, and machines placed nearby, therefore dynamic balance improves the accuracy of a machine, reduces cycle times, and reduces the required size, mass, and stiffness of base frames and floors. For robotic end-effectors dynamic balance is advantageous because of dynamic decoupling. A <b>balanced</b> <b>mechanism</b> also remains stationary in any position which is advantageous for realizing safe and energy efficient large motion of objects. Since commonly dynamic <b>balancing</b> of multi-degree-of-freedom <b>mechanisms</b> is considered after the kinematic synthesis of a mechanism, profitable solutions without excessive mass, inertia, and complexity addition are hardly found. In this work a methodology was developed that considers dynamic balance as a design principle in the synthesis of dynamically <b>balanced</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> New mechanisms were found where all elements contribute to the motion {{as well as to}} the dynamic <b>balance.</b> Such <b>mechanisms</b> were named inherently dynamically <b>balanced</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Two methods for the synthesis of inherently dynamically <b>balanced</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were proposed which consider dynamic balance prior to the kinematic synthesis, the ‘method of linearly independent linear momentum’ and the ‘method of principal vector linkages’. Also a method was found by which the loop closure relations of general planar closed kinematic chains can be considered implicitly. For that purpose the mass of an element with general center-of-mass is modeled with one virtual equivalent mass and two real equivalent masses. For the first time a high-speed inherently dynamically balanced parallel manipulator was designed, built, and tested, showing that with dynamic balance the performance of the manipulator can be improved significantly.

We investigate the flow-level Valiant Load Balancing (VLB) technique that uses randomization {{to deal with}} highly volatile data center network traffics. Through extensive simulation experiments, we show that flow-level VLB can be significantly worse than the ideal packet-level VLB for non-uniform traffics in data center networks. We propose two alternate load <b>balancing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that utilize the realtime network state information to achieve load balancing. Our experimental results indicate that these techniques can improve the performance over flow-level VLB in many situations. I...|$|R

50|$|An {{assessment}} of the lost revenues is needed if some power plants, such as wind turbines, have absolute priority (must-run plants).

Preferably, there should be a straight line from bit to elbow (automatic release), as this improves contact and communication between horse and rider. The wrists of the rider should remain soft and straight, as bent wrists tend to stiffen the lower arm. The elbows should be next to the rider's side, not [...] "chicken-winged" [...] and pointing outward, which decreases flexibility and softness.|$|E
50|$|This {{model was}} {{originally}} proposed in 1880 by Othniel C. Marsh. The theory states Archaeopteryx was a reptilian bird that soared {{from tree to}} tree. After the leap, Archaeopteryx would then use its wings as a <b>balancing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> According to this model, Archaeopteryx developed a gliding method to conserve energy. Even though an arboreal Archaeopteryx exerts energy climbing the tree, {{it is able to}} achieve higher velocities and cover greater distances during the gliding phase, which conserves more energy in the long run than a cursorial bipedal runner. Conserving energy during the gliding phase makes this a more energy-efficient model. Therefore, the benefits gained by gliding outweigh the energy used in climbing the tree. A modern behavior model to compare against would be that of the flying squirrel. In addition to energy conservation, arboreality is generally associated positively with survival, at least in mammals.|$|E
