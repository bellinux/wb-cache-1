500|$|Delphine {{does not}} visit Goriot as he lies on his deathbed, and Anastasie arrives too late, only once {{he has lost}} consciousness. Before dying, Goriot rages about their disrespect toward him. His funeral is {{attended}} only by Rastignac, a servant named Christophe, and two paid mourners. Goriot's daughters, rather than being present at the funeral, send their empty coaches, each bearing their families' respective coat of arms. After the short ceremony, Rastignac turns to face Paris as the lights of evening begin to appear. He sets out to dine with Delphine de Nucingen and declares to the city: [...] "À nous deux, maintenant!" [...] ("It's <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> now!") ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Lane {{reunited with}} Richard Gere for the romantic drama Nights in Rodanthe. It {{is the third}} film Gere and Lane filmed together, {{and is based on}} the novel of the same title by Nicholas Sparks. Lane also co-starred in Jumper and Untraceable in the same year. She then {{appeared}} in Killshot with Mickey Rourke, which was given a limited theatrical release before being released on DVD in 2009. While promoting Nights in Rodanthe, she expressed frustration with being typecast and stated that she was [...] "gunning for something that's not so sympathetic. I need to be a bitch, and I need to be in a comedy. I've decided. No more Miss Nice Guy." [...] Lane had even contemplated quitting acting and spending more time with her family if she is unable to get these kinds of roles. She said in an interview, [...] "I can't do anything official. My agents won't let me. <b>Between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> I don't have anything else coming out." [...] Despite her concerns with being typecast, Lane signed on to Secretariat (2010), a Disney film about the relationship between the 1973 Triple Crown-winning racehorse and his owner, Penny Chenery, whom Lane portrayed.|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} amount of the correspondence between Fronto and Marcus has survived. The pair were very close. [...] "Farewell my Fronto, wherever you are, my most sweet love and delight. How is it <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me?</b> I love you {{and you are not}} here." [...] Marcus spent time with Fronto's wife and daughter, both named Cratia, and they enjoyed light conversation. He wrote Fronto a letter on his birthday, claiming to love him as he loved himself, and calling on the gods to ensure that every word he learned of literature, he would learn [...] "from the lips of Fronto". His prayers for Fronto's health were more than conventional, because Fronto was frequently ill; at times, he seems to be an almost constant invalid, always suffering—about one quarter of the surviving letters deal with the man's sicknesses. Marcus asks that Fronto's pain be inflicted on himself, [...] "of my own accord with every kind of discomfort".|$|E

6000|$|... "Had {{it never}} swerved more than {{at this moment}} Walter, another need not {{be called upon to}} speak <b>between</b> <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> <b>me!</b> My words would then have been regarded, my voice would then have been loud enough to be heard. Why are you dumb? a single happy {{syllable}} might now save him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Drop that bloody sir, then; it's unbecoming now, as <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me.</b> Call me Marble, or Moses; as I call you, Miles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the idea," [...] {{answered}} Flossie; [...] "a {{heart to}} heart talk <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> and nobody else. Half-past four. Don't forget." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've studied your merry old {{progenitor}} pretty closely," [...] said Archie, [...] "and, <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> I can't {{imagine him}} approving of anybody!" ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{she heard}} this, the maiden {{rose to her}} feet, and would have put her hand in his. 'Not yet,' said Theseus, kindly, 'till water has clean washed away that which is <b>between</b> <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> <b>me.</b> But wherefore, maiden, being in fear as you were, did you not call to the gods in heaven to keep you, but to the {{asparagus}} thorns that cannot hear or help?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look'ee, fellow," [...] {{he called}} to Blunt, [...] "thou art he who struck me whilst I was down some while since. Wilt thou let this quarrel stand <b>between</b> <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> meet <b>me</b> man to man without weapon? See, I throw me down mine own, <b>and</b> will meet <b>thee</b> with bare hands." [...] And as he spoke, he tossed the clog he held in his hand back upon the cot.|$|R
6000|$|... "We have wronged each other," [...] {{answered}} he. [...] "Mine was {{the first}} wrong, when I betrayed thy budding youth into a false and unnatural relation with my decay. Therefore, {{as a man who}} has not thought and philosophised in vain, I seek no vengeance, plot no evil against <b>thee.</b> <b>Between</b> <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> the scale hangs fairly balanced. But, Hester, the man lives who has wronged us both! Who is he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It isn't {{really a}} locality, though,' he said. 'It's a perfected {{relation}} <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> and others--the perfect relation--so {{that we are}} free together.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{continued}} George, [...] "as {{the affair}} had been talked over so often <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> I thought {{it right to}} tell you." ...|$|E

6000|$|And thenceforth shall so firm an amity 'Twixt <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> be, {{that neither}} Fortune, The monstrous phantom which pursues success, [...] 180 That careful miser, that free prodigal, Who ever alternates, with changeful hand, Evil and good, reproach and fame; nor Time, That lodestar of the ages, to whose beam The winged years speed o'er the {{intervals}} [...] 185 Of their unequal revolutions; nor Heaven itself, whose beautiful bright stars Rule and adorn the world, can ever make The least division <b>between</b> <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> Since now I find a refuge in thy favour.

60|$|Because {{his faith}} in God made him high-minded, generous, and courteous; as when he bids Lot go whither he will with his flocks and herds. 'Let there be no strife, I pray <b>thee,</b> <b>between</b> <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> <b>me.</b> If thou wilt take the left hand, I {{will go to the}} right.' He is then, as again with the king of Sodom, and with the three strangers at the tent door, and with the {{children}} of Heth, when he is buying the cave of Machpelah for a burying-place for Sarah-- always and everywhere the same courteous, self-restrained, high- bred, high-minded man.|$|R

60|$|The {{moral of}} your letter, my dearest cousin, {{certainly}} {{is that no}} green herb of a secret will spring up and flourish <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Were I {{to listen}} to the common {{feelings}} of my sex, Sigismund, this reluctance to accept what both my father and myself offer might cause me to feign displeasure. But, <b>between</b> <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> there shall be naught but holy truth. My father has well weighed all these objections, and he has generously decided to forget them. As for me, placed in the scale against thy merits, they have never weighed at all. If thou canst not become noble in order that we may be equals, I shall find more happiness in descending to thy level, than by living in heartless misery at the vain height where I have been placed by accident." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I haven't--there! But it's <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> in confidence. He thinks I have. I made a {{noise like}} {{breaking}} with him, and he deserved it, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is no {{question}} of manners, sweetheart, <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me.</b> It has not come to that, I hope. Do you wish for any change,--as regards me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, Doctor Break {{said it was}} a {{professional}} matter, so the laugh was turned on me. I was horribly afraid it might have been something unladylike and indelicate. But that wasn't my triumph. Dad asked me to play on the harp. <b>Between</b> just <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> child, I had been practising a new song from London--I don't always live in trees--for weeks; and I gave it them for a surprise.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou seest, Kallikrates," [...] she said. [...] "Know {{then that}} it was I who slew thee: in the Place of Life I gave thee death. I slew thee because of the Egyptian Amenartas, whom thou didst love, for by her wiles she held thy heart, and her I could not smite as but now I smote that woman, for she was too strong for me. In my haste and bitter anger I slew <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> now for all these days have I lamented <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> waited for thy coming. And thou hast come, and none can stand <b>between</b> <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> of a truth now for death I will give thee life--not life eternal, for that none can give, but life and youth that shall endure for {{thousands}} upon thousands of years, and with it pomp, and power, and wealth, and all things that are good and beautiful, such as have been to no man before thee, nor shall be to any man who comes after. And now one thing more, and thou shalt rest and make ready for the day of thy new birth. Thou seest this body, which was thine own. For all these centuries it hath been my cold comfort and my companion, but now I need it no more, for I have thy living presence, and it can but serve to stir up memories of that which I would fain forget. Let it therefore go back to the dust from which I held it.|$|R
6000|$|There can {{surely be}} no {{advantage}} in further argument <b>between</b> <b>you</b> [...] <b>and</b> <b>me</b> at this stage—especially {{after so many}} hours and pages of [...] it—on the recognition of usage beyond the limit of Ulster custom [...] as a distinct head. You pressed your view repeatedly on the [...] cabinet, which did not adopt it.

6000|$|... "That is well," [...] Seaman replied, [...] "but I feel uneasy. I {{must not}} stay here longer. Too {{intimate}} an association <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> is unwise." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "How could I help it, my dear Wallingford?

60|$|In {{the height}} of this work my fourth year expired, from the time I was cast on this island, At this time I did not forget my anniversary; but kept it with rather greater devotion than before. For now my hopes being frustrated, I looked upon this world as a thing {{had nothing to do}} with; and very well might I say as Father Abraham said unto Dives, <b>Between</b> <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> there is a gulph fixed. And indeed I was {{separated}} from its wickedness too, having neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the pride of life; I had nothing to covet, being lord, king and emperor over the whole country I had in possession, without dispute and without control: I had loadings of corn, plenty of turtles, timber in abundance, and grapes above measure. What was all the rest to me? the money I had lay by me as despicable dross, which I would freely have given for a gross of tobacco pipes, or a hard mill to grind my corn: in a word the-nature and experience of these things dictated to me this just reflection: That the good things of this world are no farther good to us, than they are for our use; and that whatever we may heap up to give to others, we can but enjoy as much as we use, and no more.|$|R
