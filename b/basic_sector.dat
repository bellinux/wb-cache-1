He also instituted a new knighthood for his loyal officers known as Chempakaraman Pillai, re-organized the commercial sector and monopolized the spice trade. New roads and inns were opened throughout the state with military outposts. Water transport from Varkala, Thiruvananthapuram to Cochin was implemented under Marthanda Varma while he also renovated the Padmanabhapuram Palace and built Krishnapuram Palace, Alappuzha. Marthanda Varma also made villages the most <b>basic</b> <b>sector</b> of the kingdom and created a post known as the Mandapathu Vathilkkal, similar to the later tehsildar. He paid special attention to improving agriculture in the state. The portions of land lying east of Nagercoil, Kanyakumari called Nanjil Nadu was considered the granary of Kerala due to its extensive cultivation of paddy rice. The fertility of this area was only due to the irrigation facilities introduced by Marthanda Varma. His edicts {{on the subject of}} irrigation issued between 1729 and 1758 fill several pages in Travancore Land Revenue Manual by R Mahadeva Iyer. Only due to the digging of new canals for irrigation during his reign, the single-crop paddy fields of that area became double-crop fields, almost doubling their production.|$|E

Before that time, Oțel și pîine was being recommended as a major accomplishment of the new literary school, in articles by Socialist Realist critics such as Sami Damian or Mihai Novicov. Late in 1951, Dumitriu himself had publicly pledged {{to follow up on}} Călugăru's example and write the second-ever Romanian book to deal [...] "with the <b>basic</b> <b>sector</b> in our economy, heavy industry." [...] In 1953, as the Romanian literary scene reoriented itself in accordance with the guidelines suggested by Soviet politico Georgy Malenkov, the same book was officially criticized, on the behalf of the Romanian Writers' Union, by author Eugen Frunză. Frunză's official report, formed around Malenkov's theories about literary types and naturalness in Socialist Realist literature, argued: [...] "The reader of Ion Călugăru's book Oțel și pîine was for sure able to note that the author is able to individualize certain negative characters. In contrast, the reader will encounter in the same book some six Central Committee activists, who are nothing other than diagrams, not in any way distinguished one from the other". Similar criticism had been voiced a year earlier by communist politician and literary chronicler George Macovescu, in reference to Călugăru's contributions in the reportage genre, particularly his initial piece on the Hunedoara Steel Foundry. In Macovescu's opinion, the text [...] "is not a reportage, but an article not yet woven, or a fragment from a report not so well researched." ...|$|E

The disaggregation of the manufacturing sector into new and existing establishments extends previous export base models. In addition, the model is estimated for three county classification (metro, adjacent, and nonadjacent) to determine how the size of local markets affect the impact of the <b>basic</b> <b>sector</b> (manufacturing) on the nonbasic sector (other sectors). ^ The results indicate the response in nonbasic employment to changes new and existing manufacturing employment was not statistically different in nonadjacent counties. In metro and adjacent counties, the size of the impact only varied slightly. These results imply that new and existing manufacturing establishments are equally capable of stimulating nonbasic employment. ^ The model indicates nonmetro communities suffer larger leakages of economic activity relative to metro communities. This suggests nonmetro communities lack the size and diversity of markets present in metro communities to retain all local business and household purchases. ^ The analysis also shows the economic structure of the community plays an important role in the growth of nonbasic employment. Across all county classifications, communities with larger markets and better infrastructure tend to receive more of a stimulus from the expansion of the <b>basic</b> <b>sector.</b> These communities also have stronger overall economic growth. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} ten years, {{integrated}} land use and transportation modeling has received considerable attention in the scholarly literature. This academic interest is slowly yielding practical applications. Many metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) and state departments of transportation are beginning to implement these types of models for the first time. While many improvements {{have been made to}} these models, and the value of these improvements should not be understated, much work still remains. One of the most challenging problems in land use modeling is how floorspace (buildings) is built and occupied. The {{purpose of this paper is}} twofold: first, to draw attention to insufficiencies in the representation of floorspace developer behaviorâ€”particularly as it applies to large, urban-edge projectsâ€”within current integrated land use and transportation models and, second, to determine the necessity of explicitly accounting for such projects within these models. The Sacramento MEPLAN model will be used together with historical development records to demonstrate and test these assertions. Single large developments are modeled with a common year of development, size, and location. Among the findings, large developments are fairly common in the Sacramento region and make up a considerable amount of floorspace development in absolute terms, large <b>basic</b> <b>sector</b> developments have more of an impact and are therefore more important to explicitly account for than are large non-basic sector developments. A single large <b>basic</b> <b>sector</b> development modeled in a 20 year forecast has a significant impact on zonal outputs.
