60|$|Rivers {{cannot be}} forded if their depth exceeds 3 feet for men or 4 feet for horses. Fords are easily {{discovered}} by typing a sounding-pole to {{the stern of}} a boat rowing {{down the middle of}} the stream, and searching those places where the pole touches the bottom. When no boat is to be had, fords should be tried for where the river is broad rather than where it is narrow, and especially at those places where there are bends in its course. In these the line of shallow water does not run straight across, but follows the direction of a line connecting a promontory on one side to the nearest promontory on the other, as in the drawing; that is to say, from A to B, or from B to C, and not right across from <b>B</b> <b>to</b> <b>b,</b> from A to a, or from C to c. Along hollow curves, asa, b, c, the stream runs deep, and usually beneath overhanging banks; whilst in front of promontories, as at A, B, and C, the water is invariably shoal, unless it be a jutting rock that makes the promontory. Therefore, by entering the stream at one promontory, with the intention of leaving it at another, you ensure that at all events the beginning and end of your course shall be in shallow water, which you cannot do by attempting any other line of passage.|$|E

Calculations are performed for the B 1, B 2, B 3, B 4, B 8 _ 1 and h-MgO polymorphs of MgO to compute lattice constants and bulk moduli. The isothermal enthalpy calculations predict that <b>B</b> 4 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 8 _ 1, h-MgO <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 8 _ 1, <b>B</b> 3 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 2, <b>B</b> 4 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 2 and h-MgO <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 2 transitions take place at 2, 9, 37, 42 and 64 GPa respectively. The high pressure transitions <b>B</b> 8 _ 1 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 2 and <b>B</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 2 are found <b>to</b> occur at 340 and 410 GPa respectively. The pressure dependent changes are observed largely in the valence electrons Compton profiles whereas core profiles are almost independent of the pressure in all MgO polymorphs. Increase in pressure results in broadening of the valence Compton profiles. The principal maxima in the second derivative of Compton profiles shifts towards high momentum side in all structures. Reorganization of momentum density in the <b>B</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 2 structural phase transition is seen in the first and second derivatives before and after the transition pressure.

40|$|Product {{data sheet}} 1. General {{description}} The HEF 4104 B is a quad low voltage-to-high voltage translator with 3 -state outputs. It provides {{the capability of}} interfacing low voltage circuits to high voltage circuits. For example low voltage Local Oxidation Complementary MOS (LOCMOS) and Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) to high voltage LOCMOS. It has four data inputs (A 0 to A 3), an active HIGH output enable input (OE), four data outputs (<b>B</b> 0 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 3) and their complements (<b>B</b> 0 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 3). With OE = HIGH, the outputs <b>B</b> 0 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 3 and <b>B</b> 0 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 3 are in the low impedance ON-state, either HIGH or LOW {{as determined by the}} inputs A 0 to A 3. With OE = LOW, the outputs <b>B</b> 0 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 3 and <b>B</b> 0 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 3 are in the high-impedance OFF-state. It uses a common negative supply (VSS) and separate positive supplies for the inputs (VDD(A)) and the outputs (VDD(B)). VDD(A) must always be {{less than or equal to}} VDD(B), even during power turn-on and turn-off. For the permissible operating range of VDD(A) and VDD(B) see Figure 4. Each input protection circuit is terminated between VDD(B) and VSS. This allows the input signals to be driven from any potential between VDD(B) and VSS, without regard to current limiting. When driving from potentials greater than VDD(B) or less than VSS, the current at each input must be limited to 10 mA. It operates over a recommended VDD power supply range of 3 V to 15 V referenced to VSS (usually ground). Unused inputs must be connected to VDD, VSS, or another input. 2. Features and benefits � Fully static operation � 5 V, 10 V, and 15 V parametric ratings � Standardized symmetrical output characteristics � Inputs and outputs are protected against electrostatic effects � Specified from � 40 �C to + 85 �C � Complies with JEDEC standard JESD 13 -BNXP Semiconductor...|$|R

40|$|The {{abilities}} of 151 Streptococcus agalactiae strains to oxidize 95 carbon sources were studied using the Biolog system. Two populations were constituted: {{one with a}} high risk of causing meningitis (HR group; 63 strains), and the other with a lower risk of causing meningitis (LR group; 46 strains). Strains belonging to the HR group were significantly less able to use four carbon sources, i. e., α-d-glucose- 1 -phosphate, d-ribose, β-methyl-d-glucoside, and d,l-α-glycerol phosphate, than strains from the LR group (P ≤ 0. 004). Moreover, strains in the HR group significantly more frequently possessed one of several mobile genetic elements or genome deletions previously shown to be associated with strains responsible for neonatal meningitis than strains in the LR group (P < 0. 001). These findings suggest that genetic disruption might have occurred in virulent clones of S. agalactiae. Fifteen biotypes (<b>B</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 15) were identified from the results of oxidation of the four carbon sources, of which six (<b>B</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 6) included 92 % of the isolates belonging to the HR group. Strains of biotypes <b>B</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 6 are thus 13 {{times more likely to be}} able to invade the central nervous system of neonates than strains of biotypes <b>B</b> 7 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 15. In addition, 86 % of strains recently associated with neonatal meningitis (42 strains studied) were identified as being of biotypes <b>B</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 6.

40|$|The {{electronic}} structure and phase stability of MgTe, ZnTe, and CdTe {{were examined in}} the zinc-blende (B 3), wurtzite (B 4), and NiAs-type (B 8) crystal structures using a first-principles method. Both the band-gap and valence-band maximum (VBM) deformation potentials of MgTe, ZnTe, and CdTe in the B 3 structure were analyzed, revealing a less negative band-gap deformation potential from ZnTe to MgTe to CdTe, with a VBM deformation potential increase from CdTe to ZnTe to MgTe. The natural band offsets were calculated {{taking into account the}} core-level deformation. Ternary alloy formation was explored through application of the special quasirandom structure method. The B 3 structure is found to be stable over all (Zn,Cd) Te compositions, as expected from the preferences of ZnTe and CdTe. However, the (Mg,Zn) Te alloy undergoes a <b>B</b> 3 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 4 transition above 88 % Mg concentration and a <b>B</b> 4 <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 8 transition above 95 % Mg concentration.
