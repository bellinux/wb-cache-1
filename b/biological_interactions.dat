We develop a discrete theoretical framework based on {{the analysis of the}} asymptotic dynamics of <b>biological</b> <b>interaction</b> networks.

Our main result is that the conventional decomposition into strongly connected components fulfills the formal conditions of being a modular organisation. We also propose a modular and incremental algorithm for an efficient equilibria computation. Furthermore, we point out that our framework enables a finer analysis providing a decomposition in elementary modules, possibly smaller than strongly connected components...|$|R

25|$|Urban ecosystems, {{influenced}} as {{they are}} by the density of human buildings and activities differ considerably from those of their rural surroundings. Anthropogenic buildings and waste, as well as cultivation in gardens, create physical and chemical environments which have no equivalents in wilderness, in some cases enabling exceptional biodiversity. They provide homes not only for immigrant humans but also for immigrant plants, bringing about interactions between species which never previously encountered each other. They introduce frequent disturbances (construction, walking) to plant and animal habitats, creating opportunities for recolonization and thus favoring young ecosystems with r-selected species dominant. On the whole, urban ecosystems are less complex and productive than others, due to the diminished absolute amount of <b>biological</b> <b>interactions.</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE — The study aims to {{test whether}} <b>biological</b> <b>interaction</b> between {{hyperglycemia}} and albuminuria can explain the inconsistent findings from epidemiological studies and clinical trials about effects of hyperglycemia on stroke in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A total of 6, 445 Hong Kong Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes and free of stroke at enrollment were followed up for a median of 5. 37 years. Spline Cox proportional hazard regression was used to obtain hazard ratio curves, which were used to identify cutoff points of A 1 C and spot urinary albumin–to–creatinine ratio for increased ischemic stroke risk. The identified cutoff point of A 1 C was used to check <b>biological</b> <b>interaction</b> between A 1 C and albuminuria (micro- and macroalbuminuria). The <b>biological</b> <b>interaction</b> was estimated using relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion due to interaction (AP), and synergy index. RESULTS — During the follow-up period, 4. 45 % (n � 287) of patients developed ischemic stroke. A 1 C was associated with increased hazard ratios of ischemic stroke in a near-linear manner except for two points— 6. 2 and 8. 0 %—where the slope between these two points accelerated.

2500|$|He {{expanded}} {{this idea}} in a 1985 paper written while visiting Santa Rosa National Park in Costa Rica. [...] While there, {{he observed that}} almost all of the species in the park occupied large geographic ranges, and despite the heterogeneity of habitats across these ranges, individuals were mostly identical across locations, indicating that little local adaptation had taken place. He described the cyclical life history pattern he believed responsible for this pattern: a species begins as a small population occupying a small area with little genetic variation, but then {{over the course of a}} few generations grows to occupy a large area, either because of the emergence of a genotype successful over a wider range, or because of the removal of a geographic barrier. [...] This large interconnected population is now subject to many contradictory selection pressures and thus remains evolutionarily static until a disturbance separates populations, restarting the cycle. [...] This cyclic life history pattern is dependent on three premises: that the ancestral range of most species is smaller than the ones now occupied, that biological communities have porous borders and are thus subject to invasion, and that species possess robust genotypes that allow them to colonize new habitats without evolution. Thus, many biological communities may be made up of organisms that despite their complex <b>biological</b> <b>interactions</b> have very little evolutionary history with each other.|$|E

Results To study more complex relationships involving multiple <b>biological</b> <b>interaction</b> types, we assembled an integrated Saccharomyces cerevisiae network in which nodes represent genes (or their protein products) and differently colored links represent the aforementioned five <b>biological</b> <b>interaction</b> types. We examined three- and four-node interconnection patterns containing multiple interaction types and found many enriched multi-color network motifs. Furthermore, we showed {{that most of the}} motifs form 'network themes' – classes of higher-order recurring interconnection patterns that encompass multiple occurrences of network motifs. Network themes can be tied to specific biological phenomena and may represent more fundamental network design principles. Examples of network themes include a pair of protein complexes with many inter-complex genetic interactions – the 'compensatory complexes' theme. Thematic maps – networks rendered in terms of such themes – can simplify an otherwise confusing tangle of biological relationships. We show this by mapping the S. cerevisiae network in terms of two specific network themes.

30|$|As is well known, the biokinetic {{behavior}} of the ZnO-NPs depends both on their physicochemical properties, determined principally by the method of obtaining them, their dissolution properties in biological fluids and the nanoparticle–protein interaction. Specifically, the toxicity mechanism of nanoparticles must depend on the physicochemical properties such as particle size, the kinetics of dissolution and retained surface species, but {{the understanding of the}} contribution of each of them to toxicity is incomplete [21, 22]. This is why studies such as that of Aula et al.

The ecotoxicity of ZnO would be caused mainly by the soluble fraction of oxide, i.e., by the Zn ion [24]. The work of Eixenberger et al.
