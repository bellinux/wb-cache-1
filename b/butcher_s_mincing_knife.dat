50|$|A {{meat grinder}} or meat mincer is a kitchen {{appliance}} for fine chopping ('mincing') and/or mixing of raw or cooked meat, fish, vegetables or similar food. It replaces tools like the <b>mincing</b> <b>knife,</b> for example, {{which is also}} used to produce minced meat, filling, etc. The producer puts the minced food into a funnel, which is placed {{on the top of the}} grinder. From there the material goes on a horizontal screw conveyor. This screw conveyor, which can be powered by a hand wheel or an electric motor, squashes and partially mixes the food. At the end of the screw, conveyor there is a knife installed directly in front of the fixed hole plate. At this opening the minced meat comes out of the machine. The fineness of the meat depends on the size of the holes of the plate.|$|R

Tendrils are contact-sensitive, filamentous organs that permit climbing plants to tether to their taller neighbors. Tendrilled legume species are grown as field crops, where the tendrils {{contribute to the}} physical support of the crop prior to harvest. The homeotic tendril-less (tl) mutation in garden pea (Pisum sativum), identified almost a century ago, transforms tendrils into leaflets. In this study, we used a systematic marker screen of fast neutron?generated tl deletion mutants to identify Tl as a Class I homeodomain leucine zipper (HDZIP) transcription factor. We confirmed the tendril-less phenotype as loss of function by targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING) in garden pea and by analysis of the tendril-less phenotype of the t mutant in sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus). The conversion of tendrils into leaflets in both mutants demonstrates that the pea tendril is a modified leaflet, inhibited from completing laminar development by Tl. We provide {{evidence to show that}} lamina inhibition requires Unifoliata/LEAFY-mediated Tl expression in organs emerging in the distal region of the leaf primordium. Phylogenetic analyses show that Tl is an unusual Class I HDZIP protein and that tendrils evolved either once or twice in Papilionoid legumes. We suggest that tendrils arose in the Fabeae clade of Papilionoid legumes through acquisition of the Tl gene. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2001 Academic Press. All rights reserved. A mutant form of {{the common}} beta-subunit of the GM-CSF, interleukin- 3 (IL 3) and IL 5 receptors is {{activated}} by a 37 residue duplicated segment which includes the WSXWS motif and an adjacent, highly conserved, aliphatic/basic element. Haemopoietic expression of this mutant, hbeta(c) FIDelta, in mice leads to myeloproliferative disease. To examine the mechanism of activation of this mutant we targetted the two conserved motifs in each repeat for mutagenesis. Here we show that this mutant exhibits constitutive activity in BaF-B 03 cells {{in the presence of}} mouse or human GM-CSF receptor alpha-subunit (GMRalpha) and this activity is disrupted by mutations of the conserved motifs in the first repeat. In the presence of these mutations the receptor reverts to an alternative conformation which retains responsiveness to human IL 3 in a CTLL cell line co-expressing the human IL 3 receptor alpha-subunit (hIL 3 Ralpha). Remarkably, the activated conformation is maintained in the presence of substitutions, deletions or replacement of the second repeat. This suggests that activation occurs due to insertion of extra sequence after the WSXWS motif and is not dependent on the length or specific sequence of the insertion. Thus hbeta(c) displays an ability to fold into functional receptor conformations given insertion of up to 37 residues in the membrane-proximal region. Constitutive activation most likely results from a specific conformational change which alters a dormant, inactive receptor complex, permitting functional association with GMRalpha and ligand-independent mitogenic signalling.

The batter of the mince, characterised by higher protein solubility and viscosity and lower fat content (S 1), exhibited greater structural stability at temperatures above 50 °C. The addition of gelling ingredients always produced an increase in maximum rigidity values, except in the case of sodium caseinate or starch-containing batters of mince with low protein solubility and viscosity (S 2), where the rigidity is considerably inferior throughout the experimental temperature range. Of the non-muscle proteins assayed, batters contanining egg white presented the highest rigidity at maximum gelation peak, mainly in the low quality <b>mince</b> (<b>S</b> 2).

Moreover, in all the samples colony count at 30 °C, Enterobacteriaceae, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Pseudomonas spp. were determined. The carcasses contamination was {{in compliance with the}} criteria fixed by EC Reg. 2073 / 2005. Gas composition of the headspace changed significantly during the storage, mainly at + 8 °C, where a significant decrease of O 2 (until 0. 1 - 0. 6 %) and an increase of CO 2 (until 81. 0 - 89. 0 %) were recorded. This could be related to the level of LAB and Pseudomonas spp. Less significant changes were observed at + 2 °C. At 7 days of storage colony count, mean values were higher than > 107 CFU/g in the samples at + 8 °C, and also at 14 days at + 2 °C, presumably due to the high levels of Pseudomonas spp., that was dominant {{at the end of the}} test.

The {{products}} that founders William Butcher, Jr. (a {{son of the}} founder of W. & <b>S.</b> <b>Butcher</b> Steel Works, a scion of the Sheffield, England steel industry) and Philip Syng Justice (an American manufacturer) planned to produce were cast-steel locomotive tires (that is, in British spelling, tyres) and cast-steel forgings, {{with a plan to}} make eventually a promising new product: steel rails, which would be far superior to older iron ones. At about this time in nearby Bethlehem, the predecessor company of Bethlehem Steel was also getting into the steel rail business. The Nicetown site was chosen because plenty of the anthracite coal that moved by river, canal, and rail from northeast Pennsylvania passed by Nicetown on its way to Port Richmond. Anthracite was superior to bituminous coal for steelmaking. Nicetown's proximity to one of the principal locomotive-building plants of the western hemisphere, the Baldwin Locomotive Works (which at the time was just a few rail-served miles away in the Spring Garden neighborhood), was another benefit of the site.|$|R
40|$|The Echoplanar Imaging Thrombolysis Evaluation Trial (EPITHET) {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) -diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) mismatch predicts the response to thrombolysis. There is no accepted standardized definition of PWI-DWI mismatch. We compared common mismatch definitions in the initial 40 EPITHET patients. Raw perfusion images were used to generate maps of time to peak (TTP), mean transit time (MTT), time to peak of the impulse response (Tmax) and first moment transit time (FMT). DWI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and PWI volumes were measured with planimetric and thresholding techniques. Correlations between mismatch volume (PWIvol-DWIvol) and DWI expansion (T 2 (Day 90 -vol) -DWI(Acute-vol)) were also assessed. Mean age was 68 +/- 11, time to MRI 4. 5 +/- 0. 7 hours, and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 11 (range 4 to 23). Tmax and MTT hypoperfusion volumes were significantly lower than those calculated with TTP and FMT maps (P or = 20 % was observed in 89 % (Tmax) to 92 % (TTP/FMT/MTT) of patients. Application of a + 4 s (relative to the contralateral hemisphere) PWI threshold reduced the frequency of positive mismatch volumes (TTP 73 %/FMT 68 %/Tmax 54 %/MTT 43 %). Mismatch was not significantly different when assessed with ADC maps. Mismatch volume, calculated with all parameters and thresholds, was not significantly correlated with DWI expansion. In contrast, reperfusion was correlated inversely with infarct growth (R=- 0. 51; P= 0. 009). Deconvolution and application of PWI thresholds provide more conservative estimates of tissue at risk and decrease the frequency of mismatch accordingly. The precise definition may not be critical; however, because reperfusion alters tissue fate irrespective of mismatch. K. <b>S.</b> <b>Butcher,</b> M. Parsons, L. MacGregor, P. A. Barber, J. Chalk, C.

40|$|Visual clutter {{concerns}} {{designers of}} user interfaces and information visualizations. This should not surprise visual perception researchers because excess and/or disorganized display items can cause crowding, masking, decreased recognition performance due to occlusion, greater difficulty at both segmenting a scene and performing visual search, and so on. Given a reliable {{measure of the}} visual clutter in a display, designers could optimize display clutter. Furthermore, a measure of visual clutter could help generalize models like Guided Search (J. M. Wolfe, 1994) by providing a substitute for “set size ” more easily computable on more complex and natural imagery. In this article, we present and test several measures of visual clutter, which operate on arbitrary images as input. The first is {{a new version of}} the Feature Congestion measure of visual clutter presented in R. Rosenholtz, Y. Li, S. Mansfield, and Z. Jin (2005). This Feature Congestion measure of visual clutter is based on the analogy that the more cluttered a display or scene is, the more difficult it would be to add a new item that would reliably draw attention. A second measure of visual clutter, Subband Entropy, is based on the notion that clutter is related to the visual information in the display. Finally, we test a third measure, Edge Density, used by M. L. Mack and A. Oliva (2004) as a measure of subjective visual complexity. We explore the use of these measures as stand-ins for set size in visual search models and demonstrate that they correlate well with search performance in complex imagery. This includes the search-in-clutter displays of J. M. Wolfe, A. Oliva, T. <b>S.</b> Horowitz, <b>S.</b> <b>Butcher,</b> and A.

According to the increased consumer concern regarding health and food safety, and simultaneously the abusive use of chemical products to control pathogenic flora, it is essential to get knowledge about bacteriocinogenic and technological properties provided by starter strains in meat products. Within this framework, it was developed a study in order to evaluate technological flora, namely Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), found in different Portuguese fermented/smoked sausages (Chourição (CH), Chouriço de Carne (CC), Chouriço de Vinho (CV), Linguiça (L), Paio (P) and Salsichão Grosso (SG)), at three different production points (meat batter after stuffing, meat batter after half maturation and final product), and work surfaces after cleaning procedures (mixing machine (<b>S</b> 1), <b>mincing</b> machine (<b>S</b> 2), wall of stuffing room (S 3) and stuffing machine (S 4), from three factories located in Alentejo, Portugal (factories A, B and C). The 232 LAB isolates from MRS agar plates (80 isolates from factory A, 56 isolates from factory B and 96 isolates strains from factory C) were pre-selected after microscopic observation of their morphology, Gram coloration, catalase and oxidase tests, obtaining a set of 89 isolates presumptively Lactobacilli (25 strains from factory A, 15 strains from factory B and 49 strains from factory C). Pre-selected Lactobacilli isolates (n= 89) were genetically identified by PCR (Dubernet, Desmasures and Guéguen, 2002), identifying 58. 5 % of isolates (n= 52) as Lactobacillus genus (60. 0 % from factory A, 20. 0 % from factory B and 61. 2 % from factory C). 21. 2 % of these isolates were identified by PCR (Berthier and Ehrlich, 1998) as L. sakei, 15. 4 % as L. curvatus and 15. 4 % as L. plantarum. Those strains were evaluated regarding their potential of producing bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances against a sensitive strain Enterococcus avium EA 5 (isolated at LAM- IAP SAS, Kosice, Slovakia, by Lauková, A.) and different pathogens Salmonella enteritidis CECT 4300, Listeria monocytogenes 4 A CECT 934, Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 8325, Campylobacter coli ZIM 140, Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168, through the Skalka modified method (Skalka, Pillich & Pospisil, 1983). The strain Enterococcus faecium EK 13 (Enterocina A producer, isolated by Lauková, A.) was used as positive control. Eight tested strains (L. sakei CV 2 C 2, CV 3 C 2, CH 2 C 5 and CH 3 C 7; L. curvatus CH 2 C 3 and L 2 B 5; L. plantarum P 2 B 2 and S 4 B 8) shown ability to inhibit all pathogenic strains under study, and five strains (n= 5) of L. plantarum produced inhibitory zones ≥ 12. 0 mm against the sensitive strain EA 5 (P 3 B 6, P 3 B 7, P 3 B 8, S 4 B 6 and S 4 B 8). The strains L. sakei CV 2 C 2, CH 3 C 7, CV 3 C 2, C 2 C 7 and L. plantarum S 4 B 8 and P 2 B 2 revealed ability to inhibit C. coli ZIM 140 and C. jejuni ATCC 11168.

40|$|Background Whether {{intravenous}} {{tissue plasminogen}} activator (alteplase) is eff ective beyond 3 h after onset of acute ischaemic stroke is unclear. We aimed to test whether alteplase given 3 – 6 h after stroke onset promotes reperfusion and attenuates infarct growth in patients who have a mismatch in perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) and diff usionweighted MRI (DWI). Methods We prospectively and randomly assigned 101 patients to receive alteplase or placebo 3 – 6 h after onset of ischaemic stroke. PWI and DWI were done before and 3 – 5 days after therapy, with T 2 -weighted MRI at around day 90. The primary endpoint was infarct growth between baseline DWI and the day 90 T 2 lesion in mismatch patients. Major secondary endpoints were reperfusion, good neurological outcome, and good functional outcome. Patients, caregivers, and investigators were unaware of treatment allocations. Primary analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00238537. Findings We randomly assigned 52 patients to alteplase and 49 patients to placebo. Mean age was 71 · 6 years, and median score on the National Institutes of Health stroke scale was 13. 85 of 99 (86 %) patients had mismatch of PWI and DWI. The geometric mean infarct growth (exponential of the mean log of relative growth) was 1 · 24 with alteplase and 1 · 78 with placebo (ratio 0 · 69, 95 % CI 0 · 38 – 1 · 28; Student’s t test p= 0 · 239); the median relative infarct growth was 1 · 18 with alteplase and 1 · 79 with placebo (ratio 0 · 66, 0 · 36 – 0 · 92; Wilcoxon’s test p= 0 · 054). Reperfusion was more common with alteplase than with placebo and was associated with less infarct growth (p= 0 · 001), better neurological outcome (p< 0 · 0001), and better functional outcome (p= 0 · 010) than was no reperfusion. Interpretation Alteplase was non-signifi cantly associated with lower infarct growth and signifi cantly associated with increased reperfusion in patients who had mismatch. Because reperfusion was associated with improved clinical outcomes, phase III trials beyond 3 h after treatment are warranted.
