25|$|By mutating aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, chemists have {{expanded}} the genetic codes of various organisms to include lab-synthesized amino acids {{with all kinds}} of useful properties: photoreactive, metal-chelating, xenon-chelating, crosslinking, spin-resonant, fluorescent, <b>biotinylated,</b> and redox-active amino acids. Another use is introducing amino acids bearing reactive functional groups for chemically modifying the target protein.|$|E
25|$|A ‘selector’ is {{designed}} {{which consists of}} <b>biotinylated</b> DNA oligonucleotide probes targeting the recurrently mutated regions chosen for the specific cancer type. The selector is chosen using a multiphase bioinformatics approach. Using the selector, a probe-based hybridization capture is performed on tumor and normal DNA to discover mutations specific to the patient. The hybridization capture is then also applied to ctDNA to quantify the mutations that were previously discovered.|$|E
25|$|Pyro{{sequencing of}} {{bisulfite}} treated DNA. This is sequencing of an amplicon {{made by a}} normal forward primer but a <b>biotinylated</b> reverse primer to PCR the gene of choice. The Pyrosequencer then analyses the sample by denaturing the DNA and adding one nucleotide {{at a time to}} the mix according to a sequence given by the user. If there is a mis-match, it is recorded and the percentage of DNA for which the mis-match is present is noted. This gives the user a percentage methylation per CpG island.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} designed at further elucidating protease {{activity is}} Proteomic Identification of protease Cleavage Sites (PICS). Beginning with a peptide library generated from endopeptidase digestion of a proteome, this technique allows for screening and characterizing the prime- and non-prime specificity for proteases. After digestion, primary amines and sulfhydryl are chemically blocked before digesting the sample {{again with the}} desired protease. Now, protease generated primary amines that constitute the prime site of cleavage can be <b>biotinylated</b> and isolated due to their reactivity and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Non-prime sides sequences left behind must be determined using bioinformatics analysis of the extracted N-termini and full length protein sequences. These prime and non-prime sites give a full picture of protease cleavage site specificity.|$|E
25|$|Hybridization capture {{with the}} {{selector}} probe set is performed on tumor DNA from a biopsy and sequenced {{to a depth}} of ~10,000× coverage. The <b>biotinylated</b> selector probes bind selectively to the regions of the DNA library that were chosen to be where the recurrently mutations occur in the given cancer type. In this way you are left with a smaller library that is enriched for only the regions you want, which can then be sequenced. This allows the determination of patient specific mutations. Hybridization capture with the same selector is then performed on ctDNA from the blood to quantify the previously identified mutations in the patient. CAPP-Seq can be applied to ctDNA from multiple blood samples at different time points in order to follow tumor evolution.|$|E
2500|$|Biotin {{is widely}} used {{throughout}} the biotechnology industry to conjugate proteins for biochemical assays. Biotin's small size means the biological activity of the protein {{will most likely be}} unaffected. This process is called biotinylation. Because both streptavidin and avidin bind biotin with high affinity (Kd of [...] 10−14mol/l to 10−15mol/l) and specificity, <b>biotinylated</b> proteins of interest can be isolated from a sample by exploiting this highly stable interaction. [...] The sample is incubated with streptavidin/avidin beads, allowing capture of the <b>biotinylated</b> protein of interest. [...] Any other proteins binding to the <b>biotinylated</b> molecule will also stay with the bead and all other unbound proteins can be washed away. [...] However, due to the extremely strong streptavidin-biotin interaction, very harsh conditions are needed to elute the <b>biotinylated</b> protein from the beads (typically 6M guanidine HCl at pH1.5), which often will denature the protein of interest. [...] To circumvent this problem, beads conjugated to monomeric avidin can be used, which has a decreased biotin-binding affinity of ~10−8mol/l, allowing the <b>biotinylated</b> protein of interest to be eluted with excess free biotin.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the ability to}} label and identify individual cells via fluorescent antibodies, cellular products such as cytokines, proteins, and other factors may also be measured as well. [...] Similar to ELISA sandwich assays, cytometric bead array (CBA) assays use multiple bead populations typically differentiated by size and different levels of fluorescence intensity to distinguish multiple analytes in a single assay. [...] The amount of the analyte captured is detected via a <b>biotinylated</b> antibody against a secondary epitope of the protein, followed by a streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin treatment. The fluorescent intensity of R-phycoerythrin on the beads is quantified on a flow cytometer equipped with a 488nm excitation source. [...] Concentrations of a protein of interest in the samples can be obtained by comparing the fluorescent signals to those of a standard curve generated from a serial dilution of a known concentration of the analyte. Commonly also referred to as cytokine bead array (CBA).|$|E

50|$|Extent of {{biotinylation}} {{can also}} be measured by streptavidin gel-shift, since streptavidin remains bound to biotin during agarose gel electrophoresis or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

50|$|For Chem-seq to be feasible, {{the small}} {{molecule}} under study must be amenable to biotinylation without disruption of its natural binding properties. This {{is simply not}} possible with certain small molecules and even when it is, the process can require expertise in organic chemistry. Once synthesized, the binding properties of the <b>biotinylated</b> compound must be tested. To date, this has been accomplished by comparing the binding kinetics of the <b>biotinylated</b> and unmodified compounds, a process that requires prior knowledge of the proteins that the compound binds.|$|E
5000|$|The key to ampliPHOX Colorimetric Detection Technology is a light-initiated {{chemical}} reaction that forms solid polymer {{spots on the}} microarray. <b>Biotinylated</b> targets are first captured onto the microarray, and subsequently labeled with a streptavidin-coupled initiator. When a proprietary solution is added and light from the ampliPHOX Reader illuminates the array, polymer grows selectively from only locations where the <b>biotinylated</b> targets were captured. The process occurs {{in just a few}} minutes, and can be seen with the unaided eye and subsequently imaged with the ampliPHOX Reader.|$|E
50|$|Polyclonal {{antibodies}} {{are heavily}} glycosylated, and because glycosylation does {{not interfere with}} the antibody activity, biotinylating the glycosyl groups is an ideal strategy to generate <b>biotinylated</b> antibodies.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} to primary amine biotinylation is to label sulfhydryl groups with biotin. Because free sulfhydryl groups are less prevalent on most proteins compared to primary amines, sulfhydryl biotinylation is useful when primary amines {{are located in}} the regulatory domain(s) of the target protein or when a reduced level of biotinylation is required. Sulfhydryl-reactive groups such as maleimides, haloacetyls and pyridyl disulfides, require free sulfhydryl groups for conjugation; disulfide bonds must first be reduced to free up the sulfhydryl groups for biotinylation. If no free sulfhydryl groups are available, lysines can be modified with various thiolation reagents (Traut's reagent, SAT(PEG4), SATA and SATP), resulting in the addition of a free sulfhydryl. Sulfhydryl biotinylation is performed at a slightly lower pH (6.5-7.5) than labeling with NHS esters. Besides whole proteins, <b>biotinylated</b> peptides can be synthesized by introducing a cysteine (Cys) residue during synthesis at the terminus of the amino acid chain to get a site specific and oriented biotinylation. Nucleotides can also be <b>biotinylated</b> by incorporation of <b>biotinylated</b> nucleotides.|$|E
5000|$|The non-covalent bond formed between biotin and avidin or {{streptavidin}} has {{a binding}} affinity that {{is higher than}} most antigen and antibody bonds and approaches {{the strength of a}} covalent bond. This very tight binding makes labeling proteins with biotin a useful tool for applications such as affinity chromatography using immobilized avidin or streptavidin to separate the <b>biotinylated</b> protein from a mixture of other proteins and biochemicals. <b>Biotinylated</b> protein such as <b>biotinylated</b> bovine serum albumin (BSA) is used in solid-phase assays as a coating on the well surface in multiwell assay plates. Biotinylation of red blood cells {{has been used as a}} means of determining total blood volume without the use of radiolabels such as chromium 51, allowing volume determinations in low birth weight infants and pregnant women who could not otherwise be exposed to the required doses of radioactivity. Furthermore, biotinylation of MHC molecules to create MHC multimers has become a useful tool for identifying and isolating antigen-specific T-cell populations. More recently, in vivo protein biotinylation was developed to study protein-protein interactions and proximity in living cells ...|$|E
50|$|During In vivo Chem-seq, {{cultured cells}} in medium are treated {{simultaneously}} {{with either a}} <b>biotinylated</b> version of the small molecule under study or DMSO (as a control) and 1% formaldehyde for the crosslinking of DNA, proteins and small molecules. DNA is then extracted from the cells, sonicated and enriched for regions containing the <b>biotinylated</b> molecule of interest by incubation with streptavidin magnetic beads, which {{have a very high}} affinity for biotin. The enriched DNA fraction is then purified, eluted from the beads and subjected to next generation sequencing. Genomic regions enriched in the Chem-seq library relative to the control are associated with the small molecule under study.|$|E
50|$|<b>Biotinylated</b> dextran amines (BDA) are organic {{compounds}} used as anterograde and retrograde neuroanatomical tracers. They {{can be used}} for labeling the source as well as the point of termination of neural connections and therefore to study neural pathways.|$|E
50|$|Glycoproteins can be <b>biotinylated</b> by {{modifying the}} {{carbohydrate}} residues to aldehydes, which then react with hydrazine- or alkoxyamine-based biotinylation reagents. Sodium periodate oxidizes the sialic acids on glycoproteins to aldehydes to form these stable linkages at pH 4-6.|$|E
50|$|For example, avidin-displaying baculoviruses {{could be}} imaged in rat brain by coating them with <b>biotinylated</b> iron particles, {{rendering}} them visible in MR imaging. The biodistribution of the iron-virus particles {{was seen to}} concentrate on the choroid plexus cells of lateral ventricles.|$|E
50|$|In biochemistry, {{biotinylation}} is {{the process}} of covalently attaching biotin to a protein, nucleic acid or other molecule. Biotinylation is rapid, specific and is unlikely to perturb the natural function of the molecule due to the small size of biotin (MW = 244.31 g/mol). Biotin binds to streptavidin and avidin with an extremely high affinity, fast on-rate, and high specificity, and these interactions are exploited in many areas of biotechnology to isolate <b>biotinylated</b> molecules of interest. Biotin-binding to streptavidin and avidin is resistant to extremes of heat, pH and proteolysis, making capture of <b>biotinylated</b> molecules possible {{in a wide variety of}} environments. Also, multiple biotin molecules can be conjugated to a protein of interest, which allows binding of multiple streptavidin, avidin or Neutravidin protein molecules and increases the sensitivity of detection of the protein of interest. There is a large number of biotinylation reagents available that exploit the wide range of possible labelling methods. Due to the strong affinity between biotin and streptavidin, the purification of <b>biotinylated</b> proteins has been a widely used approach to identify protein-protein interactions and post-translational events such as ubiquitylation in molecular biology.|$|E
50|$|Chem-seq {{relies on}} the ability to create a <b>biotinylated</b> version of a small {{molecule}} of interest to allow for downstream affinity capture. Chem-seq can be carried out either In vitro or In vivo, although the results from each have proven to be highly similar.|$|E
50|$|Avidin's {{affinity}} for biotin is exploited in wide-ranging biochemical assays, including western blot, ELISA, ELISPOT and pull-down assays. In {{some cases the}} use of <b>biotinylated</b> antibodies has allowed the replacement of radioiodine labeled antibodies in radioimmunoassay systems, to give an assay system which is not radioactive.|$|E
50|$|The {{incorporation}} of ampliTAG onto the <b>biotinylated</b> microarray {{is the first}} step toward detecting the microarray capture event. Labeling the microarray with ampliTAG is performed manually and is not accomplished using the ampliPHOX Reader. The microarray labeling process consists of a five-minute incubation step followed by a five-minute wash.|$|E
