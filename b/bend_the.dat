5|$|Burns is {{in southeastern}} Oregon near the {{northern}} edge of the arid Harney Basin. The basin is part of the High Lava Plains, a region dominated by erupting volcanoes in the late Miocene, five to ten million years ago. Centered on the Brothers Fault Zone, which runs southeast–northwest between Steens Mountain and <b>Bend,</b> <b>the</b> High Lava Plains merge with the Blue Mountains to the north and the Basin and Range Province to the south.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, South Bend {{was laid}} out as the county seat and {{as one of the}} four {{original}} townships of St. Joseph County with 128 residents. Soon after, design began on what would become the town of South <b>Bend.</b> <b>The</b> town was formally established in 1835 and rapidly grew. In 1856, attorney Andrew Anderson founded May Oberfell Lorber, the oldest business in St. Joseph County. He compiled a complete index of South Bend's real estate records.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} of the murder the area was a semirural rainforest. Morgan’s Corner is a bend on Nuuanu Pali Drive that {{connected}} Honolulu to Kāneʻohe before it was superseded by Hawaii Route 61. <b>The</b> <b>bend</b> is after a hairpin turn from the Honolulu side of <b>the</b> <b>bend.</b> Morgan’s Corner became referred to as a “corner” because <b>the</b> <b>bend</b> curves <b>the</b> road perpendicularly so that from Honolulu one enters <b>the</b> <b>bend</b> from <b>the</b> north and exits to the east or from Kāneʻohe one enters <b>the</b> <b>bend</b> from <b>the</b> east and exits to the north. The namesake came from Dr. James Morgan who built his villa on the inside of <b>the</b> <b>bend</b> in <b>the</b> 1920s. Opposite Morgan, Wilder’s house was south of <b>the</b> <b>bend.</b>|$|R

5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the <b>bend.</b> <b>The</b> outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful positive feedback loop.|$|E
5|$|Mississippi Highway 465 (MS 465) is {{a highway}} in the {{southern}} region of the Mississippi Delta. The highway starts at U.S. Route 61 (US 61) near Redwood. It travels westward towards the Mississippi River, and then northwards {{to the village of}} Eagle <b>Bend.</b> <b>The</b> highway then traverses on the Mississippi River levee on a one-lane road. Later, MS 465 leaves the levee, continues northward, and soon ends at MS 1.|$|E
5|$|Sound {{movement}} {{through the atmosphere}} is affected by wind shear, which can <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> wave front, causing sounds to be heard where they normally would not, or vice versa. Strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development, but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into living longer life cycles that can then produce severe weather. The thermal wind concept explains how differences in wind speed with height are dependent on horizontal temperature differences, and explains {{the existence of the}} jet stream.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of a qualifier, <b>the</b> term <b>bending</b> is {{ambiguous}} because bending can occur locally in all objects. Therefore, to make the usage of the term more precise, engineers refer to a specific object such as; <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> of rods, <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> of beams, <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> of plates, <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> of shells and so on.|$|R

5|$|Synchrotrons are {{generally}} national facilities, each with several dedicated beamlines where data is collected without interruption. Synchrotrons were originally {{designed for use}} by high-energy physicists studying subatomic particles and cosmic phenomena. The largest component of each synchrotron is its electron storage ring. This ring is actually not a perfect circle, but a many-sided polygon. At each corner of the polygon, or sector, precisely aligned magnets <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> electron stream. As the electrons’ path is bent, they emit bursts {{of energy in the}} form of X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The South Bend Museum of Art {{is located}} in Century Center in {{downtown}} South <b>Bend.</b> <b>The</b> museum was {{opened to the public}} in March 1996, and features a variety of artists from South Bend and the Michiana region.

5|$|Although Kawasaki's theorem {{completely}} {{describes the}} folding patterns that have flat-folded states, {{it does not}} describe the folding process needed to reach that state. For some folding patterns, {{it may be necessary}} to curve or <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping the rest of the paper flat and only changing the dihedral angles at each fold. For rigid origami (a type of folding that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a folding pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|E

As the soil stiffness increases from 0.8 to 8  MPa (i.e., the modular ratio decreases from 50 to 5), the value of <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> moment at <b>the</b> center of the strip footing decreases by 60.8 %. Also, the decrease in <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> moment over <b>the</b> edge part of the strip footing is smaller than the decrease in <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> moment over <b>the</b> middle part.|$|R
5|$|Bart {{gets into}} a fight with Nelson Muntz, the school bully, while {{defending}} Lisa and the cupcakes that she baked for Miss. Hoover's birthday party. Nelson beats up Bart after school and warns him to expect the same treatment the following day. At home, Marge consoles and encourages Bart to reason with Nelson. Homer urges Bart to <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> rules and fight dirty. Taking Homer's advice, Bart does so, but is beaten up again. Bart turns to the toughest member of the Simpson family, Grampa Simpson, who introduces Bart to Herman, the crazed one-armed proprietor of an army surplus store. He instructs Bart on military tactics, then Bart declares war on Nelson and his sidekicks.|$|E
5|$|Due to her honesty, Marge {{does not}} sell any homes. Hutz informs {{her to use}} more {{positive}} descriptions when selling the houses, and also informs Marge if she does not sell {{a house in the}} first week, she will be fired. Marge tries to <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> truth, but fails as she just cannot lie to others. Marge does not disclose the entire truth of the house she sells to Ned Flanders and his family, which had been the site of a multiple homicide. The Flanders purchase the house and bid farewell to the Simpsons.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the rural}} ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing {{influence}} of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement. The ranchers largely maintained {{control of the country}} outside Tombstone, {{due in large part to}} the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers, and who also grew to intensely dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earps' complaints about the McLaurys' and Clantons' horse thieving and cattle rustling. The Earps were known to <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction.|$|E
50|$|A {{class of}} plant hormones called auxins {{coordinates}} this root growth process. Auxins {{play a key}} role in <b>bending</b> <b>the</b> plants root towards the water because they cause one side of the root to grow faster than the other and thus <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> of <b>the</b> root.|$|R
50|$|A spine crank (the term spine lock is {{also often}} used to refer {{exclusively}} to this type) is a spinal lock that affects the thoracic and/or lumbar regions of the spinal column. A spine crank is applied by twisting or <b>bending</b> <b>the</b> upper body beyond its normal ranges of motion, causing hyperextension, hyperflexion, or hyperrotation of the spine. In martial arts, spine cranks are generally rarer techniques than neck cranks {{because they are more}} difficult to apply. Twisting or <b>bending</b> <b>the</b> upper body to apply pressure to the spinal column requires large amounts of leverage compared to twisting or <b>bending</b> <b>the</b> head.|$|R

5|$|South Bend's {{location}} {{around the}} St. Joseph River has influenced {{the development of}} its streets. While city streets mainly follow a grid layout, road development also adapted to the river's path. South Bend is connected to state and national highway systems by State Roads 2, 23, and 933; U.S. Route 20 and 31; and Interstate 80 and 90, the Indiana Toll Road. Original routes of both the Lincoln Highway and the Dixie Highway also pass through South <b>Bend.</b> <b>The</b> headquarters for the Lincoln Highway Association are in South Bend.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy. The device uses a magnet to <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> trajectory of a beam of ions, {{and the amount of}} deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist Francis William Aston used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The atomic mass of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the whole number rule. The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the neutron, an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the proton, by the physicist James Chadwick in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The eldest living {{brother of}} the late King Robert, Stannis Baratheon, announces himself as {{rightful}} heir to the Iron Throne. From his court {{on the island of}} Dragonstone, he sends a letter to all the corners of the Seven Kingdoms announcing that Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella Baratheon are not Robert's true heirs, but rather the products of incest between Cersei Lannister and her twin brother Jaime. Stannis refuses to seek an alliance with Robb Stark or Renly Baratheon, despite the advice of his advisor Ser Davos Seaworth, because he sees them as usurpers; Stannis insists that all will <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> knee to him or be destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The plant's initial {{response}} to contact with prey consists of thigmotropic (movement {{in response to}} touch) tentacle movement, with tentacles bending toward the prey {{and the center of}} the leaf to maximize contact. D. anglica is also capable of further movement, being able to <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> actual leaf blade around prey to further the digestion process. Tentacle movement can occur in a matter of minutes, whereas the leaf takes hours or days to bend. When something gets caught, the tentacles touching the prey exude additional mucilage to mire down the prey, which eventually dies of exhaustion or is asphyxiated as the mucilage clogs its tracheae. Once the prey has been digested and the resulting nutrient solution has been absorbed by the plant, the leaf unfurls, leaving only the prey's exoskeleton behind.|$|E
5|$|CR149 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY52 {{in the community}} of Youngsville. The route progresses northward, passing and paralleling Tremper Road, a dead-end road. CR149 passes by several residential homes in Youngsville, along with one local commercial building. After leaving the community, CR149 continues to the north as Shandelee Road, passing through the residential surroundings. After passing by a few more residences, Shandelee Road makes a bend to the northwest, and into more dense woodlands in the area. About a mile north of Youngsville, CR149 continues its way northward, passing by a local residence, and intersects with Stump Pond Road, which heads westward from the main highway. Shandalee Road makes another bend, this time to the north, passing through moderate development for about another mile. A short distance into the <b>bend,</b> <b>the</b> woodlands that were surrounding the highway clear and the highway becomes surrounded by fields and residential homes.|$|E
5|$|Kaecilius {{uses the}} stolen pages {{to contact the}} {{powerful}} Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time is non-existent. Kaecilius destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off {{with the help of}} the Cloak of Levitation until Mordo and the Ancient One arrive. Strange and Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One after Kaecilius reveals that the Ancient One's long life is due to her drawing power from the Dark Dimension. Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have to <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension irresistibly engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then creates an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment of time. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he leave Earth and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the time loop.|$|E
