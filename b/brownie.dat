40|$|The {{effects of}} {{substitution}} of cocoa with sorghum bran in <b>brownies</b> were evaluated. Particle size, color, phenol content, tannin content and antioxidant activity of sorghum brans were evaluated and compared to cocoa {{before and after}} the roasting process. Cocoa was substituted in levels of 25 % and 50 % with non roasted and roasted sorghum brans. Color, phenol content, tannin content and antioxidant activity, and texture of <b>brownies</b> containing sorghum bran as a cocoa extender were evaluated. A hedonic scale for texture, color, taste, aroma and overall acceptability of <b>brownies</b> was used for sensory evaluation of <b>brownies.</b> Objective texture test of <b>brownies</b> was evaluated with Texture Profile Analysis and color was evaluated objectively using the CIEL*a*b* scale. Color of sorghum brans similar to cocoa were achieved by adjusting decortication of sorghum, roasting time, roasting temperature, moisture content and fructose content levels. Brans with 10 % decortication had lower L* and a* values; Increase in roasting time, roasting temperature and moisture content, decreased L* values. Higher phenol content, antioxidant activity and tannin content was obtained with sorghum brans with 10 % decortication roasted at lower temperature and lower moisture content. Colors of <b>brownies</b> containing sorghum brans were similar to sample with 100 % cocoa. <b>Brownies</b> with substitution of cocoa with 25 % of roasted sorghum bran had higher phenol content, antioxidant activity and tannin content than other samples with sorghum bran. Total dietary fiber of <b>brownies</b> with 100 % cocoa was similar to those <b>brownies</b> containing bran with 10 % decortication.

40|$|The {{formula for}} making <b>brownies</b> can be {{modified}} to produce low fat <b>brownies.</b> One of the easiest ways is by reducing the use of margarine. However, the absence of margarine in the formula would decrease the <b>brownies</b> quality so guar gum could be added as fat replacer in low-fat bakery product. The addition of broccoli (Brassica olaracea L. var italic) in the formula was aimed to increase the nutritional and functional properties of <b>brownies.</b> The purposes of the research were to study the effect of various guar gum concentrations (0. 25 %, 0. 5 %, 0. 75 %, 1 %) on the physicochemical and sensory properties; also on the nutrition value of the preferred low fat <b>brownies.</b> Broccoli powder concentration that used to substitute wheat flour was 10 %. The preliminary analysis was done by acceptance sensory test of <b>brownies</b> after substituted by broccoli powder. Using the concentration of 10 % didn’t show differences in preferences with control <b>brownies.</b> Therefore, 10 % broccoli powder was used further in all free margarine <b>brownies</b> formulation that replaced with guar gum. The analysis were % volume expansion, texture profile (hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, chewiness, gumminess), water content, antioxidant activity, total phenols, vitamin C, fat content, and crude fiber. Hedonic sensory tests both rating and ranking were evaluated by 30 untrained panelists. Proximate analysis was conducted after low-fat <b>brownies</b> was chosen by panelists based on their preferences. The variables that determine the quality of <b>brownies</b> were correlated using Pearson correlation. The primary test results showed that increasing concentration of guar gum 0. 5 - 0. 75 % increased % volume expansion with the highest result 49. 43 % and reduced texture profiles at all parameters. Besides that, the greater guar gum concentration, the greater antioxidant activity and total phenols but the water content, vitamin C, fat content, and crude fiber weren’t significantly affected. The most preferred <b>brownies</b> were control, followed by both low fat broccoli <b>brownies</b> added with 0. 5 % and 0. 75 % guar gum as shown at grade 3 from a scale of 5 (accepted).

Ishii had served as the director for the original game in the series, Final Fantasy Adventure, which Sword of Mana is a remake of. The remake, in addition to adding enhanced graphics to the original Game Boy title, sought to add elements present in later games in the series, such as the Ring Command menu system, and to expand the game's storyline.

5|$|Heroes of Mana was {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Takeo Oin, and written by Masato Kato. Ishii had previously produced or directed all of the previous Mana games, while Kato also wrote the stories for Children of Mana (2006) and Dawn of Mana (2006). The game was developed by <b>Brownie</b> Brown, who previously helped develop Sword of Mana (2003). Ishii created the overall design, and <b>Brownie</b> Brown worked directly with him to implement it. As the series creator, Ishii {{felt it was important}} to be directly involved in all stages of development. Heroes of Mana was created as an RTS game to complement the other titles in the World of Mana project, which all offer a spin on the original Seiken Densetsu formula. Ishii stated that it was also to help expose Japanese gamers to real-time strategy games, a genre that is relatively obscure in Japan, while simultaneously satisfying players abroad with an RTS for an unconventional console, as most real-time strategy games are released for personal computers. To match this mission, the game was designed for more casual players than the typical fan of the traditionally role-playing game series. The Nintendo DS was chosen as the platform partially due to the system's multiplayer potential as well as giving the sensation of touching the game. The team found developing an RTS for the Nintendo DS to be difficult, and had to start development over at one point. Although prior to the World of Mana project Ishii has said that the games in the series are only thematically connected, Heroes is explicitly set as a prequel to Seiken Densetsu 3 (1995), depicting battles between the nations present in that game. It is set one generation prior to Seiken Densetsu 3, with some characters noted as the parents of characters in the other game.|$|E
