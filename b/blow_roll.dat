60|$|I heard Frank <b>Rolls</b> <b>blowing</b> his infernal whistle {{opposite}} {{my summer}} cottage at some ghastly {{hour in the}} morning. Even without getting out of bed, I could see from the window {{that it was no}} day for fishing. No, not raining exactly. I don't mean that, but one of those peculiar days--I don't mean wind--there was no wind, but a sort of feeling in the air that showed anybody who understands bass fishing that it was a perfectly rotten day for going out. The fish, I seemed to know it, wouldn't bite.|$|R
6000|$|When I {{was still}} {{fretting}} over the annoyance of the disappointment I heard Frank <b>Rolls</b> <b>blowing</b> his whistle {{in front of}} the other cottages.

It was clear to me that the other [...] "boys" [...] had thrown the thing over. There was no use in my trying to go out alone. I stayed where I was, my doze lasting till ten o'clock.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the experimental program reported here was to evaluate {{the possibility of using}} tangential <b>blowing</b> to create <b>roll</b> and yaw control on a delta wing-forebody combination at high angles of attack. It is found that the vortical flow over the model can be manipulated more efficiently by blowing on the nose section rather than fuselage. Large rolling moments and side forces are generated by blowing from forebody compared to wing blowing. For a wing-body combination, a model with a blunt nose is found to be less sensitive to flow asymmetry than a sharp-nosed configuration. Rolling moment changes sign from prestall to stall for all the configurations tested...|$|R

Deliberately taking the carbine from the dead man's hand, and plucking the revolver from his belt, he sauntered off {{in the direction of the}} stables. These being too small to contain all the troop-horses, some of the animals were picketed in an open shed, and several troopers were rubbing them down. The men took Jake for one of the cow-boys of the ranch, for he passed them whistling.|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using forebody tangential blowing {{to control the}} roll-yaw motion of a wind tunnel model is experimentally demonstrated. An unsteady model of the aerodynamics is developed based on the fundamental physics of the flow. Data from dynamic experiments is used to validate the aerodynamic model. A unique apparatus is designed and built that allows the wind tunnel model two degrees of freedom, roll and yaw. Dynamic experiments conducted at 45 degrees angle of attack reveal the system to be unstable. The natural motion is divergent. The aerodynamic model is incorporated into the equations of motion {{of the system and}} used for the design of closed loop control laws that make the system stable. These laws are proven through dynamic experiments in the wind tunnel using blowing as the only actuator. It is shown that asymmetric blowing is a highly non-linear effector that can be linearized by superimposing symmetric blowing. The effects of forebody tangential <b>blowing</b> and <b>roll</b> and yaw angles on the flow structure are determined through flow visualization experiments. The transient response of roll and yaw moments to a step input blowing are determined. Differences on the roll and yaw moment dependence on blowing are explained based on the physics of the phenomena...|$|R

40|$|Films {{based on}} linear low-density {{polyethylene}} (LLDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) containing linalool or methylchavicol were prepared by extrusion film <b>blowing.</b> Film <b>rolls</b> of LLDPE containing linalool or methylchavicol were stored {{at ambient temperature}} for 1 year. Samples of these films were then evaluated {{for the amount of}} linalool or methylchavicol retained and for their antimicrobial (AM) activity by the agar disc diffusion assay. In addition, film rolls of LDPE-EVA (LDPE-ethylene vinyl acetate) containing linalool or methylchavicol were stored at 25 and 35 °C. Samples of these films were periodically collected to quantify the amount of linalool or methylchavicol retained as a function of time. For the AM LLDPE films, a decrease in additive retention was observed but there was no statistically significant difference in their AM activity against Escherichiacoli at the beginning and after 1 year of storage. For the AM LDPE-EVA films, the amount of additive in the film decreased with time and the additive retention in all films tended to deviate from the theoretical first-order decay. These findings suggest that an amount of linalool or methylchavicol that is sufficient to maintain AM activity remained in the polymeric matrix after the storage period. This study confirms the potential use of polymeric films containing basil constituents as AM films for enhancing quality and safety as well as the extension of the shelf life of foods...|$|R
5|$|Employees of ANA {{believed}} the container had last {{been used to}} drain fuel from the cross-feed drain cock, the fuel cock that serves the pipe in the wing centre-section for cross-feeding of fuel from tanks in one wing to engines in the other wing. Moments after this procedure commenced, the staff member was advised of {{a telephone call from}} his wife and he went to answer the telephone. With the cross-feed selector valves closed, little fuel ran out when the drain cock was opened. Some employees believed that because no fuel was running out neither the staff member nor anyone else noticed the drain cock was still open. Due either to the wind or the slipstream from Amana's propellers as it began to taxi prior to take-off, the almost-empty container was <b>blown</b> over and <b>rolled</b> some distance along the apron where it was found the next morning.|$|R
60|$|They rode {{in single}} file with Ladd in the lead. He did not keep to {{the trail of the}} raiders all the time. He made short cuts. The raiders were {{traveling}} leisurely, and they evinced a liking for the most level and least cactus-covered stretches of ground. But the cowboy took a bee-line course for the white escarpment pointed out by the Yaqui; and nothing save deep washes and impassable patches of cactus or rocks made him swerve from it. He kept the broncho at a steady walk over the rougher places and at a swinging Indian canter over the hard and level ground. The sun grew hot and the wind began to <b>blow.</b> Dust clouds <b>rolled</b> along the blue horizon. Whirling columns of sand, like water spouts at sea, circled up out of white arid basins, and swept away and spread aloft before the wind. The escarpment began to rise, to change color, to show breaks upon its rocky face.|$|R
40|$|The solo {{exhibition}} at Canary Wharf curated by Ann Elliott comprised two installations ‘Globes of Stuff’ and The Palace of Raw Dreams. Five large, resin globes resting on different axis, scattered around {{different areas of}} the floor, like tumbleweeds, made sight lines with each other. All cast from the same mould, a giant ball of wrapped cloth with an accumulation of seemingly random objects haphazardly emerging from various parts of its folds. A key part of the work revolves around the idea of the accumulation of this, reflected by the globes sitting at different angles and so revealing different surfaces as though they have been <b>blown</b> or <b>rolled</b> through the space of the building, creating a sense of movement and relationship to one another as they occupy various locations. ‘The Palace of Raw Dreams’ is a large wooden walkway that supports a rectangular screen made of transparent, amber Perspex. At either side of the structure is a ladder, stairs that seem to provide access to the walkway, although central to the piece is the fact that these cannot be climbed, involving the audience while keeping them at a slight remove. The walkway and its screen create the sense of a set or a stage, albeit one that is perhaps ambiguous or mysterious: seen from without, behind the scenes. The film, like a type of opera, shot in the Antonio Pasqualino Museum in Palermo, Sicily, shows fragmented narratives from varying perspectives including the puppets. The sounds echoed through the lobby of Canada Square. The two installations have in common a sense of both movement and the static, of presence and absence, of making something strange to itself by dislocating or altering it slightly from reality and the world around it: presenting or raising {{a different point of view}} from which to see and interpret objects, ideas, and how we might engage with them...|$|R
2500|$|The tornado then {{struck the}} nearby town of De Soto, which was also devastated. 69 people were killed in De Soto, and many homes were swept away. 33 of the deaths were {{students}} that were killed in the partial collapse of the De Soto School, the worst tornadic death at a single school in US history. The tornado continued northeast and impacted the small village of Bush, killing seven people there. Several homes were leveled, and pieces of wood were speared into the town's water tower. Heavy railroad axles were reportedly lifted and scattered across the railyard. Further east, the mining town of West Frankfort was also devastated by the massive tornado, with 152 fatalities occurring in that area. The tornado struck the northwest side of town, leveling many businesses and sweeping away entire subdivisions. At the Orient Mine, a large multi-ton coal tipple was <b>blown</b> over and <b>rolled</b> by the tornado. Extreme damage continued east of town, as a railroad trestle was torn from its supports, and [...] of railroad track was ripped from the ground and blown away. Several small mining villages in the area were obliterated, resulting in numerous fatalities. The tornado then destroyed the small town of Parrish, where 22 people were killed, and the town was never rebuilt. Severe damage and several fatalities also occurred in the Olga area. Within 40 minutes, 541 lives were lost and 1,423 were seriously injured. The tornado proceeded to devastate rural areas across Hamilton and White counties, claiming 65 more residents before crossing into Indiana. An estimated 613 people died in Illinois, the most tornadic deaths within a state in U.S. history.|$|R
50|$|The film then flashes back to Bulgaria. Raj is {{in a car}} chase with a rival gang, {{trying to}} make off with a {{container}} of gold, when he accidentally runs over a woman, Meera. When he gets out to help her, the rival gang catches up with him, {{and he has to}} leave. Later, Raj runs into Meera again, who works as a sketch artist. He reveals to her that he is a gangster, and that he is the son of Randhir Bakshi, the leader of the gang. Veer attends a boarding school where Raj only comes to visit once a month. Randhir and Raj talk about how Raj was adopted. Raj meets with Meera again, and she asks him to take care of some guys who are troubling her. She also asks him to celebrate her birthday with her the next day. He promises {{to take care of a}} job early and then meet her in the evening. The next day, Raj is engaged in a car chase. His car gets <b>blown</b> up and <b>rolls</b> over, trapping him inside. He is confronted by Meera, who he finds out is the daughter of the rival gang’s leader, Malik. She reveals that their entire relationship so far was designed so that Malik’s gang could have a chance to kill him. She holds a gun to his head, but she chooses to spare his life this time. Later, Raj gets a new car and engages in a car chase with Meera, eventually pushing her car to the edge of a cliff. He saves Meera from falling off the cliff, then tells her that the next time he sees her, he will kill her. Despite this warning, she later comes to his home and tells him that she loves him. At first he refuses to listen to her, but then he admits that he loves her, too. They make plans to tell their parents about their relationship.|$|R
40|$|Advantages {{of flight}} at high angles of attack include {{increased}} maneuverability and lift capabilities. These are beneficial {{not only for}} fighter aircraft, but also for future supersonic and hypersonic transport aircraft during take-off and landing. At high angles of attack the aerodynamics of the vehicle are dominated by separation, vortex shedding and possibly vortex breakdown. These phenomena severely compromise the effectiveness of conventional control surfaces. As a result, controlled flight at high angles of attack is not feasible for current aircraft configurations. Alternate means to augment {{the control of the}} vehicle at these flight regimes are therefore necessary. The present work investigates the augmentation of an aircraft flight control system by the injection of a thin sheet of air tangentially to the forebody of the vehicle. This method, known as Forebody Tangential Blowing (FTB), has been proposed as an effective means of increasing the controllability of aircraft at high angles of attack. The idea is {{based on the fact that}} a small amount of air is sufficient to change the separation lines on the forebody. As a consequence, the strength and position of the vortices are altered causing a change on the aerodynamic loads. Although a very effective actuator, forebody tangential blowing is also highly non-linear which makes its use for aircraft control very difficult. In this work, the feasibility of using FTB to control the roll-yaw motion of a wind tunnel model was demonstrated both through simulations and experimentally. The wind tunnel model used in the experiments consists of a wing-body configuration incorporating a delta wing with 70 -degree sweep angle and a cone-cylinder fuselage. The model is equipped with forebody slots through which blowing is applied. There are no movable control surfaces, therefore blowing is the only form of actuation. Experiments were conducted at a nominal angle of attack of 45 degrees. A unique apparatus that constrains the model to two degrees-of-freedom, roll and yaw, was designed and built. The apparatus was used to conduct dynamic experiments which showed that the system was unstable, its natural motion divergent. A model for the unsteady aerodynamic loads was developed based on the basic physics of the flow and results from flow visualization experiments. Parameters of the aerodynamic model were identified from experimental data. The model was validated using data from dynamic experiments. The aerodynamic model completes the equations of motion of the system which were used in the design of control laws using blowing as the only actuator. The unsteady aerodynamic model was implemented as part of the real-time vehicle control system. A control strategy using asymmetric blowing was demonstrated experimentally. A discrete vortex method was developed to help understand the main physics of the flow. The method correctly captures the interactions between forebody and wing vortices. Moreover, the trends in static loads and flow structure are correctly represented. Flow visualization results revealed the vortical structure of the flow to be asymmetric even for symmetric flight conditions. The effects of <b>blowing,</b> and <b>roll</b> and yaw angles on the flow structure were determined. It is shown that superimposing symmetric and asymmetric blowing has a linearizing effect on the actuator characteristics. Transient responses of roll and yaw moments to step input blowing were characterized, and their differences were explained based on the physical mechanisms through which these loads are generated...|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after {{touching}} down in Caddo County, the tornado quickly became violent, debarking numerous trees as it crossed into Canadian County southwest of Calumet, and crossed Interstate 40 west of El Reno, reaching maximum intensity. Three {{people were killed}} as two vehicles were tossed more than 1093 yd from the road and obliterated, the victims being found stripped of clothing 1/4 mi from the interstate and left [...] "unrecognizable". Only pieces of the vehicle's frames were reportedly recovered. A nearby 20,000 lb oil tanker truck that was parked at an oil production site near the interstate was thrown approximately spell=in 1 mi into a wooded gully. Several homes were swept completely away along Interstate 40, trees were completely debarked, and the ground was heavily scoured in some areas. At the nearby Cactus-177 oil rig site, a 1,900,000 lb oil derrick was <b>blown</b> over and <b>rolled</b> three times. Due to the extreme nature of the damage at the Cactus-177 oil rig and along Interstate 40, damage in that area was rated EF5. The tornado passed north of El Reno and continued northeast, producing EF3 to EF4 damage in rural areas. The tornado then passed northwest of Piedmont as a high-end EF4, leveling multiple homes and causing additional fatalities. The Falcon Lake subdivision was particularly hard hit, and multiple homes and vehicles were swept into the lake. One home had nothing left but the foundation slab and an above ground reinforced concrete shelter, which sustained damage to its metal door from debris impacts. An SUV in this area was thrown 780 yd into a wooded thicket, and had its frame torn from the vehicle body, which was found crumpled around a debarked tree. The frame was twisted apart and was found nearby, along with the engine block and axles. The tornado weakened to EF3 strength as it crossed into Kingfisher County debarking trees and heavily damaging structures. The tornado then weakened further to EF2 strength, with damage confined to outbuildings and trees. Crossing into Logan County south of Cashion, the tornado produced a mixture of EF2 and EF3 damage as large high-tension towers were toppled and manufactured homes were destroyed. Frame homes were left with only interior rooms standing in this area, and two people who were caught outside during the tornado were killed. EF0 to EF1 damage occurred along {{the north side of}} Guthrie before the tornado dissipated.|$|R
