5|$|Krell's Klingon battlecruiser and two <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> {{arrive in}} orbit and Krell orders the ships {{to destroy the}} colony. Enterprise {{attempts}} to intervene but is engaged by the <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey.</b> Columbia arrives and joins combat with the two <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey,</b> while Enterprise impedes the battlecruiser. Meanwhile, Phlox infects a restrained Archer, as he needs human antibodies for the cure. Antaak then transports a canister of the virus onto the battlecruiser which infects the crew, including Krell. Needing the cure from Phlox, Krell stands down the attack and the Klingon High Council soon agrees to distribute the cure throughout the Empire. Tucker then agrees to remain onboard temporarily to assist with repairs.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{is a small}} bird of prey with short, broad {{wings and}} a long tail, both adaptations to manoeuvring through trees. Females can be up to 25% larger than males and weigh up to twice as much.

50|$|The <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} common Klingon ships seen in the Star Trek franchise. Introduced in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, the <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> has {{featured}} {{in five of the}} films and frequently appears in The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine. Industrial Light & Magic designed and built the <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> for Star Trek III, assisted by the film's director, Leonard Nimoy. In early drafts of the script, the <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> was to be a Romulan vessel; although this idea was later dropped, the <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> maintained its cloaking device as a plot point in the film and the Romulan bird feather patterns on its wings were kept. The <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> is the first Klingon vessel depicted with a cloaking device; all classes chronologically later in the series would also use a cloaking device. The wings <b>of</b> the <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> are able to move, lowering to attack, maintaining just above horizontal in flight mode and raising high when the ship lands. However, as the studio model's mechanism for moving the wings broke, in later Star Trek series' episodes the wings are usually fixed in either flight mode or attack mode. This was not rectified until the creation of a CGI model for the vessel. The studio models for the <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> were sold in the 2006 Christie's auction; the original model sold for US$307,200, while an enlarged wing, used for close-up shots in Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, was sold for US$8,400.|$|R

5|$|The {{middle toe}} is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed, while the talons of all the toes are comparatively straight and blunt. The feet are thus more adapted to walking, and are of little use as weapons or organs of prehension as in <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> and Old World vultures. The beak is hooked, and adapted to tear rotting meat. The irises of the male are brown, while those of the female are deep red. The eyelids lack eyelashes. Contrary to the usual rule for sexual dimorphism among <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey,</b> the female is smaller than the male.|$|E
5|$|The {{typical owls}} are small to large solitary nocturnal <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey.</b> They have large {{forward-facing}} eyes and ears, a hawk-like beak and a conspicuous circle of feathers around each eye called a facial disk.|$|E
5|$|The {{young are}} covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after six months, but {{continue}} to roost and hunt with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch. Healthy adults have no natural predators, but large <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> and mammalian predators, like foxes, may take eggs or hatchlings. Predation is relatively uncommon, since the vigilant parents often aggressively displace <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> who come near and the rocky, precipitous location of most nests are difficult for mammals to access.|$|E
