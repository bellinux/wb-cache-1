Between October 2013 and September 2016, access to Radio 2's domestic internet streams was blocked for listeners outside Canada. The CBC stated {{that they were not}} allowed to <b>broadcast</b> <b>advertising</b> outside of Canada.

2500|$|At the 2003 General Synod, the United Church of Christ began a {{campaign}} with [...] "emphasis on expanding the UCC's name-brand identity through modern advertising and marketing." [...] Formally launched during the advent season in 2004, the campaign included coordinated program of evangelism and hospitality training for congregations paired with {{national and local}} television [...] "brand" [...] advertising, known as the [...] "God is Still Speaking" [...] campaign or [...] "The Stillspeaking Initiative." [...] The initiative was themed around the quotation [...] "Never place a period where God has placed a comma," [...] and campaign materials, including print and <b>broadcast</b> <b>advertising</b> as well as merchandise, featured the quote and a large [...] "comma," [...] with a visual theme in red and black. United Church of Christ congregations were asked to opt into the campaign, signifying their support {{as well as their}} willingness to receive training on hospitality and evangelism. An evangelism event was held in Atlanta in August 2005 to promote the campaign. Several renewal groups panned the ad campaign for its efforts to create an ONA/progressive perception of the UCC identity despite its actual majority in centrist/moderate viewpoints. According to John Evans, associate professor of sociology at University of California, San Diego, [...] "The UCC is clearly going after a certain niche in American society who are very progressive and have a particular religious vision that includes inclusiveness...They are becoming the religious brand that is known for this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bianca's {{impact on}} daytime {{television}} is considered significant for various reasons: She is {{cited as a}} gay icon by soap opera and gay/lesbian media, and is credited as the first long-term lesbian character on an American soap opera. AfterElton.com, a website {{that focuses on the}} portrayal of gay men in the media, addressed Bianca's impact on viewers. They noted All My Children creator Agnes Nixon having told The Advocate in 2000 that out-lesbian Chastity Bono's memoir was the inspiration for the Bianca storyline, and that she hoped that outing an already-established character as gay would make for a more integrated storyline. AfterElton.com said the representation of gay and lesbian characters in the media is important when taking into account that the viewing audience for soap operas [...] "is enormous." [...] Cited was The Museum of Broadcast Communications' assertion that soap opera is [...] "the most effective and enduring <b>broadcast</b> <b>advertising</b> vehicle ever devised. It is also the most popular genre of television drama in the world today and probably in the history of world broadcasting..." [...] The museum states that [...] "no other form of television fiction has attracted more viewers in more countries {{over a longer period of}} time." [...] Author C. Lee Harrington, in her book Homosexuality on All My Children: Transforming the Daytime Landscape, stated that when [...] "resident villainess" [...] Greenlee Smythe uttered [...] "Bianca is gay" [...] during Bianca's coming-out storyline, it transformed the daytime landscape and ABC's All My Children entered [...] "uncharted territory" [...] for daytime television by revealing a core character as a lesbian.|$|E
