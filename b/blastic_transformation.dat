These patients were submitted to full blood counts, quantitation of mononuclear cell subpopulations by monoclonal antibodies, study of <b>blastic</b> lymphocyte <b>transformation,</b> and quantitation of circulating antibodies by the indirect immunofluorescence test, in order to correlate their clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory data with their immunological profile, and to determine the relationship between circulating autoantibody titers and lesion intensity and course of lesions under treatment. Leucocytosis was observed especially in group G 2. All patients showed decreased relative CD 3 + and CD 4 + values and a tendency to decreased relative values of the CD 8 + subpopulation. <b>Blastic</b> lymphocyte <b>transformation</b> indices {{in the presence of}} phytohemagglutinin were higher in patients (group G 1 +G 2) than in controls.

All 31 cases of common, B cell and null cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and B cell {{chronic lymphocytic leukaemia}} showed Ig heavy chain (JH) rearrangement, and TCR (beta-chain) rearrangement was seen in all 5 cases of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Inappropriate JH and TCR (beta) rearrangements were present in some cases of T-ALL (60 %) and common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (18 %), respectively. For the 19 patients with acute leukaemias following chronic myeloid leukaemia, <b>blastic</b> <b>transformation,</b> all 4 with lymphoid transformation and 3 of the 15 with myeloid transformation had JH rearrangement, and 3 CD 10 -positive lymphoid transformation and 2 myeloid transformation had their TCR (beta) genes rearranged.

Nucleolar and cytoplasmic RNA's were visualized using a simple cytochemical method followed by computer assisted densitometry and size measurements of digitised images. An increased nucleolar and cytoplasmic RNA density accompanying the <b>blastic</b> <b>transformation</b> was significant after 48 hours of cultivation with phytohemaglutinin (PHA) when stimulated cells were characterized the largest nucleolar size reflecting S or G 2 phase of the cell cycle. On the other hand, significantly larger ratio of the nucleolar to cytoplasmic density was noted only after a shorter cultivation when stimulated cells were presumably in the G 1 phase. Thus the increased nucleolar and cytoplasmic RNA density together represented an accompanying phenomenon of the cell proliferation and cycling state. From the methodical point of view, the nucleolar and cytoplasmic RNA densitometry appeared as a simple as well as useful additional method to study "dedifferentiation" or various cell states at the single cell level. In addition, it was also interesting that the increase of the nucleolar diameter in stimulated cells was much larger {{than that of the}} nucleolar density.

We performed a retrospective study to assess the incidence of AL in ET patients treated with pipobroman (PB) as first-line therapy. One hundred and sixty-four patients with ET were managed with PB at a dose of 1 mg/kg/d until a stable platelet count below 400 x 10 (9) /l was achieved. Maintenance therapy was given at a planned dose ranging between 0. 2 and 1 mg/kg/d according to platelet count, in all cases, with a median daily dose of 25 mg (range 7 - 75 mg/d). The median treatment time was 100 months (range 25 - 243 months). The patients were evaluated for the occurrence of AL and/or secondary malignancies and survival end-points. AL was observed in nine patients (5. 5 %) after a median treatment time of 153 months (range 79 - 227 months). The overall survival (OS) and the event-free survival (EFS) at 120 months were 95 % and 97 %, whereas at 180 months, they were 84 % and 76 % respectively.
