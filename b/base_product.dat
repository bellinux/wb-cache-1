The retail Switch version differs from the other console versions in that the multiplayer component is not included in the <b>base</b> <b>product,</b> but is instead offered as a free download, whereas the SnapMap component is not included at all, both changes as a result of cartridge limitations. It was released on November 10, 2017.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the scaling up of bionsecticide production from Bacillus thuringiensisvar. israelensisusing onggok (a cassava by-product) as a carbon source. The insecticide produced was used to eradicate Aedes aegypti larvae. The product was a crystal protein produced during bacterial sporulation. Scaling up from laboratory to pilot plant scale was done using two methods, i. e. constant agitation power per unit volume (Pg/V) and constant oxygen transfer coefficient (kLa). The results showed that yield of product per substrate (Yp/s) of Pg/V <b>based</b> <b>product</b> with the value of 3. 52 ± 0. 02 spora per gram substrates was higher than Yp/s of kLa <b>based</b> <b>product</b> with the value of 2. 96 spora per gram substrate. Logarithmic value of viable spore count (log of VSC) was also higher, i. e. 7. 23 ± 0. 30 for Pg/V <b>based</b> <b>product</b> as compared to 7. 17 ± 0. 20 for kLa <b>based</b> <b>product.</b> Substrate efficiency was also higher in Pg/V based (92. 47 %) than kLa based (64. 87 %). LC 50 of Pg/V <b>based</b> <b>product</b> was lower (0. 49 μg/ml) meaning that it was more toxic than kLa <b>based</b> <b>product</b> (0. 62 μg/ml). Amino acid content of Pg/V <b>based</b> <b>product</b> was also higher than kLa <b>based</b> <b>product.</b> Constant Pg/V method was suggested as a based on the scaling up of bioinsecticide production of B. thuringiensis israe/ensison industrial scal...|$|R
