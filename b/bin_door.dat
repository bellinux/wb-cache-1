40|$|The Zero Power Physics Reactor (ZPPR) {{operated}} from April 18, 1969, until 1990. ZPPR operated at {{low power}} for testing nuclear reactor designs. This paper examines {{the temperature of}} Pu content ZPPR fuel while it is in storage. Heat is generated in the fuel due to Pu and Am decay and is a concern for possible cladding damage. Damage to the cladding could lead to fuel hydriding and oxidizing. A series of computer simulations were made to determine the range of temperatures potentially occuring in the ZPPR fuel. The maximum calculated fuel temperature is 292 °C (558 °F). Conservative assumptions in the model intentionally overestimate temperatures. The stored fuel temperatures are dependent {{on the distribution of}} fuel in the surrounding storage compartments, the heat generation rate of the fuel, and the orientation of fuel. Direct fuel temperatures could not be measured but storage <b>bin</b> <b>doors,</b> storage sleeve doors, and storage canister temperatures were measured. Comparison of these three temperatures to the calculations indicates that the temperatures calculated with conservative assumptions are, as expected, higher than the actual temperatures. The maximum calculated fuel temperature with the most conservative assumptions is significantly below the fuel failure criterion of 600 °C (1, 112 °F) ...|$|R

50|$|For 2005 models, Toyota {{introduced}} its refreshed Camry with new upgrades {{such as a}} chrome grille, with the SE having a unique, blackout grille. Other exterior changes are new headlight and taillight designs, redesigned front bumper, and new wheels. Interior upgrades to the Camry included a rear center head restraint, a storage <b>bin</b> in the <b>door,</b> Optitron electroluminescent gauges, steering wheel-mounted audio controls standard for all trim levels, chrome interior door handles and shift gear button, and standard leather seating on V6-powered XLE trims. A 5-speed automatic transmission also replaced the previous 4-speed automatic and ABS became standard on all trims.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} dashboard {{was of a}} multi-piece construction, {{and gained}} {{a reputation for being}} flimsy and prone to squeaks and rattles, so in February 1986, this was replaced with the more conventional dashboard from the Montego and in the change the voice synthesis unit (prone to reliability issues) was dropped. At the same time more minor equipment upgrades were made across the range. The City X gained <b>door</b> <b>bins</b> and rear wash-wipe. The L and LE gained tweed trim. The HL and automatic gained velour trim and additional brightwork. The Vanden Plas gained leather trim and uprated electronic stereo system.|$|R
5|$|Two SEALs {{broke through}} the bedroom <b>door.</b> <b>Bin</b> Laden's wife Amal was {{on the edge of}} the bed {{shouting}} in Arabic at the SEALs, and Osama bin Laden dived across the bed, shoving Amal at the same time, for an AKS-74U kept by the headboard. The SEALs fired four shots at bin Laden; the first missed, the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing bin Laden, and the final two hit bin Laden in the chest and head, killing him instantly. In Pfarrer's account, the total time elapsed from jumping on the roof to Osama bin Laden's death was between 30 and 90 seconds.|$|R
50|$|The Octavia {{features}} numerous so-called ‘Simply Clever‘ details, i.e. an {{ice scraper}} inside the fuel filler flap, a rubbish <b>bin</b> inside the <b>door</b> panel, and a double-sided (rubber/textile) floor mat in boot. A tilting/sliding panoramic sunroof is available {{as an option}} - single-piece for the Octavia hatchback and two-piece for the Octavia Combi. The Bolero, Amundsen and Columbus car radios are protected against theft by the physical separation of the central display and the multimedia system’s own central unit. The Octavia also offers a Phone Box, a storage compartment for the mobile phone with planar antenna {{in the bottom of}} the compartment, which permits a so-called inductive exterior antenna connection.|$|R

50|$|The stations, the {{infrastructure}} and the Diemen-Zuid maintenance facility of the East Line {{were designed by}} Ben Spängberg and Sier van Rhijn, two architects at the former Public Works Department of the City of Amsterdam. Their designs in Brutalist style are characterized by large-scale application of bare concrete and excessive space in the underground station halls. It also included a sophisticated use of colour. For example, the red colour of the train doors in the original design was also used at major facilities such as billboards, gates, elevator <b>doors,</b> <b>bins,</b> and the platform signage. For {{the design of the}} entire East Line Spängberg and Van Rhijn received Merkelbach Award in 1979. The East Line was also awarded the Betonprijs (Concrete Award) in 1981, which is commemorated by the award plaques in the concourses of Centraal Station and Gein Station.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Then Mrs. White {{came in with}} Dr. Lloyd; also Tom White and Solomon Wass. After {{they had}} been in two or three minutes, {{something}} else happened. Tom White and Wass were standing with their backs to the fire, just in front of it. Eliza Rose and Dr. Lloyd were near them, with their backs turned towards the bin, the doctor nearer to the door. I stood by the drawers, and Mrs. White was by me near the inner door. Then suddenly a basin, which stood {{on the end of the}} <b>bin</b> near the <b>door,</b> got up into the air, turning over and over as it went. It went up not very quickly, not as quickly as if it had been thrown. When it reached the ceiling it fell plump and smashed. I called Dr. Lloyd's attention to it, and we all saw it. No one was near it, and I don't know how it happened. I stayed about ten minutes more, but saw nothing else. I don't know what to make of it all. I don't think White or the girl could possibly have done the things which I saw.' ...|$|R
40|$|Bamboo mat boards (BMB) are {{produced}} from woven mats of bamboo that are soaked in adhesive resin and then pressed firmly {{together in a}} hot press. They were {{the first of the}} wide range of different panel boards presently available that use bamboo as a raw material, but they are the simplest to produce, involve only bamboo raw materials and have great income generating potential for the rural poor, who are able to weave the mats from which they are formed. The technology for the manufacture of BMB in India has been developed by the Indian Plywood Industries Research Institute (IPIRTI), Bangalore, who have developed a technically feasible and commercially viable technology for its manufacture. BMB is gaining in popularity and there are currently a handful of BMB factories in operation in India and 16 in China. Bamboo mat board is very versatile and can be produced up to 6 mm thick by varying the number of mat layers used; boards are usually formed of 2, 3, 5 or 7 mats. For thicker laminated boards, wood veneers are interleaved with the bamboo boards to produce bamboo mat-veneer composite boards (The production of these is not covered in this TOTEM). BMB is at least as durable and stable as wood-based plywood and is very resistant to pest attack, extreme climatic conditions and fire. It can be used for many of the uses to which plywood is now put such as paneling, ceilings, prefabricated shelters, packing cases and storage <b>bins,</b> roofs, <b>doors</b> and door panels, furniture, and household utensils such as trays and plates. BMB is much more flexible than wood-based-plywood and can be used in structural applications such as stressed skin panels, wall bracings and web beams for which plywood is not suitable. Bamboo mat board (BMB) is a plywood-like wooden board made from layers of woven bamboo mats that have been pressed togethe...|$|R
