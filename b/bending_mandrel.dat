Two new <b>mandrel</b> <b>bend</b> testing setups have been designed by employing either centre or end clamps in order to improve the uniformity of strain distributions over coated steel coupons, and by using strain gauges to perform in situ measurements of local strains.

Using a combination of nanoindenter cantilever <b>bending</b> and <b>mandrel</b> <b>bend</b> relaxation techniques, anelastic relaxation was measured over times ranging from 1 s to 3 107 s. Direct spectrum analysis yields relaxation-time spectra, which display seven distinct peaks. The results were analyzed using a linear dashpot-and-spring model, combined with transition-state theory, to yield several STZ properties. These reveal a quantized hierarchy of STZs that differ from each other by one atomic volume. Potential STZs occupy a large volume fraction of the solid. They access their ergodic space, with the ratio of forward-to backward jump rates ranging from 1. 03 to 4. 3 for the range of stress values used. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{process of}} tube bending {{involves}} using mechanical force to push stock material pipe or tubing against a die, forcing the pipe or tube {{to conform to}} the shape of the die.

Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin (DGEBA) was treated with different stoichiometry variations of polyamidoamine adducts (ARADUR-PA 450) as a curing agent at ambient temperature to fabricate four different formulations of epoxy coatings (DGEBA-PA 450).

40|$|High {{strength}} {{stainless steel}} tube (HSST) presents promising applications in many clusters as one of key lightweight materials. While, over thinning and further crack in plastic deformation are prone to occur due to limited strain hardening and high yield-strength ratio. To avoid this phenomenon, the accurate prediction of forming limit of HSST needs to be achieved considering uneven deformation induced fracture. Via the digital speckle correlation method (DSCM) based tension, both the diffuse necking limited hardening and the variation of Lankford coefficient R along tube deformation are studied, modeled and coupled into the Hill' 48 anisotropic yield framework; then by replacing the Mises effective stress with the extended Hill's anisotropic one and using a stepwise inverse method for damage parameter calibration, both the GTN and Lemaitre ductile fracture criteria (DFCs) coupled with anisotropy evolution are established and numerically implemented; thus, regarding several indexes in cases of uniaxial tension, flaring and <b>mandrel</b> <b>bending</b> of HSST, four individual anisotropic plasticity models and two coupled models are compared and evaluated. Due to considering the interplay between inhomogeneous deformation and damage evolution, the coupling model with the improved anisotropic plasticity provides the most accurate prediction of overall performance in all cases. The significance of the coupling DFCs with the anisotropic plasticity on overall simulation of complex forming processes of tubular materials is thus recognized.

40|$|Detailed characterizaton and {{formulation}} {{studies were}} performed on a methyltriakoxysilane hydrolysate as a binder for thermal control coatings. The binder was optimized by varying hydrolysis temperature, time, catalyst type, and water concentration. The candidate coating formulations, based on this binder with TiO 2 pigment, were optimized via a detailed series of sprayed test panels that included the parameters of binder/pigment ratio, ethanol content, pigment particle size, coating thickness and cure conditions. A typical optimized coating was prepared by acetic acid catalyzed hydrolysis of methyltriethoxysilane with 3. 25 mol-equivalents of water over a 24 hour period at room temperature. The resulting hydrolysate was directly mixed with pre-milled TiO 2 (12 grams pigment/ 26 grams binder) to yield a sprayable consistency. Panels were sprayed {{to result in a}} nominal cure coating thickness of 2 mils. Cure was affected by air drying for 24 hr at room temperature plus 72 hr at 150 F.

40|$|A {{carboxylic}} acid functional trimer {{made from the}} reaction of isosorbide with maleic anhydride was used to cross-link epoxidized sucrose soyate (ESS), resulting in bio-based, degradable thermosets having a good combination of hardness and flexibility. This work addresses some critical needs for thermosets such as improving the sustainability of raw materials, enabling recycling, and achieving both good material hardness and flexibility/ductility simultaneously. In this paper, a di{{carboxylic acid}}, MI, was synthesized from isosorbide and maleic anhydride and characterized in detail by FTIR and H- 1 NMR It was utilized to cross-link ESS without using extra catalyst or toxic compounds except for ethanol and water. For comparison, a dicarboxylic acid from 1, 3 -propanediol and maleic anhydride (MP) was also synthesized and used to cross-link ESS. Because of the carbon carbon double bond in conjugation with the carboxylic acid group, both MI and MP showed high reactivity toward ESS and could cross-link ESS {{with the assistance of}} water and ethanol. The MI cross-linked thermosets exhibited superior thermal and mechanical properties and excellent coating performance including a high level of flexibility (reverse impact > 168 in. -lb and elongation at break from <b>mandrel</b> <b>bend</b> > 28 %), adhesion (5 B), and solvent resistance as well as high hardness (Konig pendulum hardness 189 s).

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of two thin-walled outer tubes showed that more extensive alpha working of the billet core stock results in more uniform cladding on the extruded tube. In {{an effort to}} eliminate breakthrough and to reduce eccentricity, shift, and <b>bending</b> of the <b>mandrel,</b> two experimental coppernickel billets with Zircaloy sleeves were extruded to check a modified billet design. lt was observed that the final grain size of the unalloyed uranium core of a thin- walled outer tube is insensitive to small variations in the cooling rate from the beta-treatment temperature. An axia' load of 3000 pounds applied to a thin- walled outer tube during autoclaving was ineffective in preventing bowing of the tube. Shipping experiments demonstrated that current packaging methods of thin- walled inner tubes do not prevent bowing during transit. The fabrication of specimens for the capsule irradiation program was concluded with the shipment of sixteen specimens and excess extruded tube stock to Savannah River Laboratory. The following core compositions were represented: U- 1 wt. % Si, unalloyed dingot uranium, U- 0. 3 wt. % Al- 0. 5 wt. % Si, and U- 0. 3 wt. % Cr- 0. 3 wt. % Mo. All irradiation specimens were supplied in the beta-treated condition. The mechanical behavior of Zircaloy- 4 -clad dingot uranium tube sections was evaluated {{as a function of}} the cooling rate from the beta treatment temperature. The results indicate that the mechanical behavior is approximately independent of the cooling rate and that, in testing to failure, fracture initiates within the core. Also, in a eimilar test of a transient-melted ingot uranium tube, the uranium core appeared to be the most brittle component. Five tubular stainless steel- Zircaloy joints were extruded for use in an experiment to determine if such joints can withstand 30 and 40 % cold reductions. (auth...|$|R
40|$|Tube bending is {{a widely}} used {{manufacturing}} process in the aerospace, automotive, and other industries. During tube bending, considerable in-plane distortion and thickness variation occurs. The thickness increases at the intrados (surface of tube {{in contact with the}} die) and it reduces at the extrados (outer surface of the tube). In some cases, when the bend die radius is small, wrinkling occurs at the intrados. In industry a mandrel is used to eliminate wrinkling and reduce distortion. However, {{in the case of a}} close bend die radius, use of a mandrel should be avoided as <b>bending</b> with the <b>mandrel</b> increases the thinning of the wall at the extrados, which is undesirable in the manufacturing operation. The present research focuses on additional loadings such as axial force and internal pressure which can be used to achieve better shape control and thickness distribution of the tube. Based on plasticity theories, an analytical model is developed to predict cross section distortion and thickness change of tubes under various loading conditions. Results from both the FEA and analytical model indicated that at the intrados the increase in thickness for bending with internal pressure and bending with combined axial pull and internal pressure was nearly the same. But in the case of bending with the combination of axial pull and internal pressure there was a significant reduction of thickness at the extrados. A parametric study was conducted for the case of bending with combined internal pressure and axial pull and it was seen that with proper selection of the pressure and axial pull wrinkling can be eliminated, thickness distribution around the tube can be optimized, and cross section distortion of the tube can be reduced. Predictions of the analytical model are in good agreement with finite element simulations and published experimental results. The model can be used to evaluate tooling and process design in tube bending...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, Sandia has {{developed}} a variety of specialized analytical techniques for evaluating the long-term aging and stability of cable insulation and other related materials. These techniques have been applied to cable reliability studies involving numerous insulation types and environmental factors. This work has allowed the monitoring of the occurrence and progression of cable material deterioration in application environments, and has provided insights into material degradation mechanisms. It has also allowed development of more reliable lifetime prediction methodologies. As {{a part of the}} FAA program for intrusive inspection of aircraft wiring, they are beginning to apply a battery of techniques to assessing the condition of cable specimens removed from retired aircraft. It is anticipated that in a future part of this program, they may employ these techniques in conjunction with accelerated aging methodologies and models that the authros have developed and employed in the past to predict cable lifetimes. The types of materials to be assessed include 5 different wire types: polyimide, PVC/Glass/Nylon, extruded XL-polyalkene/PVDF, Poly-X, and XL-ETFE. This presentation provides a brief overview of the main techniques that will be employed in assessing the state of health of aircraft wire insulation. The discussion will be illustrated with data from their prior cable aging studies, highlighting the methods used and their important conclusions. A few of the techniques that they employ are widely used in aging studies on polymers, but others are unique to Sandia. All of their techniques are non-proprietary, and maybe of interest for use by others in terms of application to aircraft wiring analysis. At the end of this report is a list showing some leading references to papers that have been published in the open literature which provide more detailed information on the analytical techniques for elastomer aging studies. The first step in the investigation of aircraft wiring is to evaluate the applicability of their various techniques to aircraft cables, after which they expect to identify a limited subset of techniques which are appropriate for each of the major aircraft wiring types. The techniques of initial interest in the studies of aging aircraft wire are as follows: optical microscopy; <b>mandrel</b> <b>bend</b> test; tensile test/elongation at break; density measurements; modulus profiling/(spatially-resolved micro-hardness); oxygen induction time/oxygen induction temperature (by differential scanning calorimetry); solvent-swelling/gel fraction; infrared spectroscopy (with chemical derivatization as warranted); chemiluminescence; thermo-oxidative wear-out assessment; The first two techniques are the simplest and quickest to apply; those further down the list tend to be more information rich and in some cases more sensitive, but also generally more specialized and more time consuming to run. Accordingly, the procedure will be to apply the simplest tests for purposes of preliminary screening of large numbers of samples. For any given material type, it can be expected that {{only a limited number of}} the other techniques will prove to be useful, and therefore, the more specialized techniques will be used on a limited number of selected samples. Samples of aircraft wiring have begun to be released to the authors in late April; they include in this report some limited and preliminary data on these materials...|$|R
40|$|National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) {{have similar}} {{missions}} and therefore similar facilities and structures in similar environments. The standard practice for protecting metallic substrates in atmospheric environments is {{the application of}} an applied coating system. The most common topcoats used in coating systems are polyurethanes that contain isocyanates. Isocyanates are classified as potential human carcinogens and are known to cause cancer in animals. The primary objective of this effort was to demonstrate and validate alternatives to aliphatic isocyanate polyurethanes resulting {{in one or more}} isocyanate-free coatings qualified for use at AFSPC and NASA installations participating in this project. This joint Test Report (JTR) documents the results of the laboratory and field testing as well as any test modifications made during the execution of the testing. The technical stakeholders agreed upon test procedure modifications documented in this document. This JTR is made available as a reference for future pollution prevention endeavors by other NASA centers, the Department of Defense and commercial users to minimize duplication of effort. All coating system candidates were tested using approved NASA and AFSPC standard coating systems as experimental controls. This study looked at eight alternative coating systems and two control coating systems and was divided into Phase I Screening Tests, Phase II Tests, and Field Testing. The Phase I Screening Tests were preliminary tests performed on all the selected candidate coating systems. Candidate coating systems that did not meet the acceptance criteria of the screening tests were eliminated from further testing. Phase I Screening Tests included: Ease of Application, Surface Appearance, Dry-To-Touch (Sanding), Accelerated Storage Stability, Pot Life (Viscosity), Cure Time (Solvent Rubs), Cleanability, Knife Test, Tensile (pull-off) Adhesion, and X-Cut Adhesion by Wet Tape After a review of the Phase I test results, four of the alternative coating systems showed substandard performance in relation to the Control Systems and were eliminated from the Phase II testing. Due to the interest of stakeholders and time constraints, however, all eight alternatives were subjected to the following Phase II tests, along with field testing at Stennis Space Center (SSC), Mississippi: Hypergol Compatibility, Liquid Oxygen Compatibility, 18 -Month Marine Exposure (Gloss Retention, Color Retention, Blistering, Visual Corrosion, Creepage from Scribe, Heat Adhesion), and Field Exposure (6 - and 12 -month Evaluation for Coating Condition, Color Retention, Gloss Retention). The remaining four alternative coating systems determined to be the best viable alternatives were carried on to Phase II testing that included: Removability, Repairability, Abrasion Resistance, Gravelometer, Fungus Resistance, Accelerated Weathering, <b>Mandrel</b> <b>Bend</b> Flexibility, and Cyclic Corrosion Resistance. Of the systems that continued to Phase II, three (3) alternative coating systems meet the performance requirements as identified by stakeholders. Two (2) other systems, that were not included in Phase II testing, performed well enough on the 18 -Month Marine Exposure, the primary requirement for NASA technical standard NASA-STD- 5008, Protective Coating of Carbon Steel, Stainless Steel, and Aluminum on Launch Structures, Facilities, and Ground Support Equipment, that they were also considered to be successful candidates. In total, five (5) alternative coating systems were approved for inclusion in the NASA-STD- 5008 Qualified Products List (QPL). The standard is intended to provide a common framework for consistent practices across NASA and is often used by other entities.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is the study of}} the {{resistance}} of different organic coatings containing volatile corrosion inhibitors environmentally friendly and their anti corrosive performance when applied to steel surfaces in sea environment. In the context of this paper, studied 7 coatings systems of 2 categories: a.) organic solvent (SB) and especially 4 coating systems (SB 1,SB 2,SB 3,SB 4) with different density in anticorrosion pigment and 1 system of organic coating with volatile corrosion inhibitor (VCI) and b.) water soluble (WB) especially 2 systems of organic coatings (WB 1,WB 2) containing resin with anticorrosive properties. Coatings in the first category contained two types of anti-corrosive pigments, oxyaminophosphate salt of magnesium and zinc phosphate pigment. As well as these systems contain volatile corrosion inhibitors. Zinc phosphate (Zn 3 (PO 4) 2 * 2 - 4 H 2 O) was the first and most important alternative "green" phosphate pigment was used in place of chromate pigments. Magnesium pigments are ecological anticorrosive pigments as they do not contain any evidence to be responsible for toxicity. Even though these pigments are manufactured at high temperatures they show high thermal stability. The anticorrosive coatings contain corrosion inhibitors in ionic form under the name of "volatile inhibitors", creating a protective layer of ions at the steel surface that stops the electrolytic action between anode and cathode regions. The volatile corrosion inhibitors are defined as compounds or mixtures of compounds (usually organic amine base-soluble in water) with high vapor pressure (107 - 10 - 2 mmHg) that can prevent general corrosion of metallic materials. In the field of organic coatings the use of corrosion inhibitors makes it possible to prepare organic coatings friendlier to the environment with the possibility of better corrosion protection and the ability to heal itself. The requirement {{for the protection of the}} environment impose on paint industries, to produce paints with lower content in volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Thus one way to reduce these, is the steady reduction in the use of organic solvents and the creation of new coatings in which we use water as solvent which as a dispersion medium allows to avoid pollution problems by solvent evaporation. The second category of waterborne coatings,which are studied, contains acrylic resin with anticorrosive properties. The anticorrosive properties of these products are based on the fact that almost no water or vapor will migrate through the polymer membrane, since no water or oxygen can penetrate into the metal substrate, so therefore there is no corrosion. Because of this unique feature, the aqueous dispersion requires no filling or anticorrosive pigment for optimum performance. This means that it is possible to deliver very high gloss in pigmented coatings with superior anticorrosive properties. The degree of corrosion protection of the coatings was estimated by determining the density of the corrosion current icorr, linear polarization resistance Rp and the corrosion rate CR as a function of exposure time of the coated specimens in a sea enironment NaCl 3, 5 % w/w. In addition to this we examine the change in the corrosion potential of the coated samples according to the exposure time in the corrosive environment. The durability of organic coatings was studied by assessing their physicochemical properties. For this study used the following methods:  Estimation of coating system adhesion by the cross cut test  Estimation of coating system adhesion by the pull-off test  Estimation of coating system flexibility by the Conical <b>mandrel</b> <b>bending</b> test Summarizing the main outcomes from this thesis it is concluded that: The coatings contain volatile inhibitors (VpCI) have very good anti-corrosion properties in the coating but lose their mechanical properties and adhesion. Moreover both anticorrosive,adhesion and mechanical properties are very good in organic coatings (SB). On the contrary,huge disadvantage is the environmental pollution due to the organic solvent. In the end,in coatings with water-soluble resins (WB) we observe changes in the anticorrosive properties by changing the composition of the coating. Generally, WB coatings do not exhibit good electrochemical properties. Adhesion is increased when the emulsion of the resin increases. The mechanical properties vary and can be placed between the mechanical properties of the two previous categories of organic coatings. ΚΥΡΙΑΚΟΣ ΣΟΛΟΜΩΝΙΔΗΣ 172 σ.
