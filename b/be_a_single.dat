5|$|If {{the bike}} and rider are {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> system, the forces that act on that system and its components can be roughly divided into two groups: internal and external. The external forces are due to gravity, inertia, contact with the ground, and contact with the atmosphere. The internal forces are caused by the rider and by interaction between components.|$|E
5|$|The {{common and}} Asian house martins have {{sometimes}} been considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> species, although both breed {{in the western}} Himalayas without hybridising. There is also limited DNA evidence that suggests a significant genetic distance between these two martins.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it appears}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> star to the naked eye, Capella is {{actually}} a system of four stars in two binary pairs. The first pair consists of two bright yellow giant stars, {{both of which are}} around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun. They have exhausted their core hydrogen, and cooled and swollen, moving off the main sequence. Designated Capella Aa and Capella Ab, they are in a very tight circular orbit some 0.76 astronomical units (au) apart, and orbit each other every 104 days. Capella Aa is the cooler and more luminous of the two with spectral class K0III; it is 78.7 ± 4.2 times the Sun's luminosity and 11.98 ± 0.57 times its radius.|$|E

5|$|Ornithologists James Hancock and Jim Kushlan also {{consider}} the two to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> species, with the differences in plumage, size, skin coloration and degree of bill darkening during breeding season forming the diagnostic characters. They have proposed the populations recontacted in northwestern South America {{after a period of}} separation, and that the color difference is likely due to the presence of an enzyme that allows uptake of pigment in the diet. They have questioned whether white-plumaged birds of South America are in fact part of the ruber rather than the albus taxon, and acknowledge that more investigation is needed to determine this.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{advanced}} to the World Series against the Boston Red Sox, whom they defeated four games to three. While the Cardinals were facing the Dodgers, the Red Sox faced a team of American League All-Stars in an exhibition match. During the game, Ted Williams injured his elbow. He recovered in time {{to play in the}} World Series, but manager Joe Cronin blamed the injury on having to wait for the three-game series to finish, and pushed for future tie-breakers to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> game. Cronin got his wish in the American League, as the 1948 American League tie-breaker was only a one-game matchup. However, the National League hosted three more series-style tie-breakers in later seasons before converting to a single-game format.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{brought with}} it {{the end of the}} {{consensus}} among English Protestants that there should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> church imposed by the state, though there was still not complete freedom of religion. The ideals of the dissenting brethren of the Assembly were significant in the rise of denominationalism, the doctrine that the church is found in several institutions rather than a single one in a given location. Though Protestants already commonly recognized the validity of churches in different territories, the outcome of the Assembly's debates marks the wider acceptance of the idea that several true churches may be found in the same territory.|$|E

5|$|The Hadoram Shirihai {{expeditions to}} the Madeira {{archipelago}} in 2008, 2009 and 2010 each had sightings of a Pterodroma petrel (possibly the same bird) with largely white underwings, but upperwings like Zino's or Fea's. This plumage does {{not correspond to}} any known Pterodroma species. It {{may have been an}} unusual variant of Zino's but this is unlikely since no similar bird has been seen amongst the more than 100 caught at the nest. It may alternatively <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> aberrant individual, a hybrid or an unknown taxon from Madeira or elsewhere. No conclusion is possible on current knowledge.|$|E
5|$|The delegates couldn't {{agree on}} whether the {{executive}} should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> person, or a board of three. Many wished to limit {{the power of the}} executive and thus supported the proposal to divide the executive power between three persons. The possible problems of this system, in addition to the knowledge that George Washington would probably be the first president, calmed the fears enough so that the proponents of a singular executive could accumulate a large coalition. This issue came up occasionally after the matter was settled, but was never again seriously doubted.|$|E
5|$|The first formal {{movement}} {{for the creation}} of a Continental navy came from Rhode Island, because its merchants' widespread smuggling activities had been severely harassed by British frigates. On 26 August 1775, Rhode Island passed a resolution that there <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> Continental fleet funded by the Continental Congress. The resolution was introduced in the Continental Congress on 3 October 1775, but was tabled. In the meantime, George Washington had begun to acquire ships, starting with the schooner USS Hannah that was paid for out of Washington's own pocket. Hannah was commissioned and launched on 5 September 1775, from the port of Marblehead, Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s {{electricity}} was supplied by municipal undertakings. These were small power companies that built power stations {{dedicated to a}} single industry or group of factories, and sold any excess electricity to the public. These companies used widely differing standards of voltage and frequency. In 1925 Parliament decided that the power grid should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> system with uniform standards and under public ownership. Several of the private power companies reacted to the proposal by forming the London Power Company. They planned to heed parliament's recommendations and build {{a small number of}} very large stations.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} {{gravitational}} lensing {{is found in}} the radio galaxy 3C 324. First thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> overluminous radio galaxy with a redshift of z=1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift z=0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged radio galaxy discovered, the source appears to be an elliptical galaxy with a dust lane obscuring our view of the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus. In even shorter wavelengths, the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 is a heavy emitter of gamma rays. This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the TeV range as of 2007. The spectrum is unique, with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others.|$|E
5|$|Debate {{on church}} {{officers}} began on 19 October. The Assembly {{began with the}} issue of ordination, as many of the divines were concerned about the rise of various sectarian movements and the lack of any mechanism for ordination of ministers of the established church. While some members did not seem to think ordination necessary for preachers (though they should not administer the sacraments without it), a majority of the divines thought any regular preaching without ordination unacceptable and wished to erect a provisional presbytery for purposes of ordination. There was also debate at this early stage over the nature of the visible church. The congregationalists considered a church to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> local congregation, while the majority considered the national church to be a unity and were alarmed at the prospect of a disintegrated English church. Despite these debates, up until the end of 1643 there was hope that a common church government could be framed that would be satisfactory to all parties involved.|$|E

5|$|Episode IIs soundtrack {{was first}} {{released}} as an album on July 7, 2004 as Xenosaga II: Jenseits Von Gut und Böse Movie Scene Soundtrack by Victor Entertainment. Including only Kajiura's work, the album spans two discs and 40 tracks {{and has a}} duration of 1:52:26. Another soundtrack album for the game, Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Böse Soundtrack, was released by Namco and Brady Games as a promotional extra for the Brady Games strategy guide for the game. The 11-track CD again excluded the work of Hosoe, instead sampling Kajiura's pieces. Released on February 17, 2005, the album has a duration of 30:25. The Movie Scene album reached position #46 on the Japanese Oricon charts. In the liner notes for Movie Scene Soundtrack, Kajiura claims that she felt that her work for the game was different from her previous pieces, as {{it was more of}} a soundtrack, with the individual tunes fitting more closely together. She also said that she found it easier to compose tracks that fit with the worldview that Mitsuda had created for the first game, rather than invent her own. She also notes that she intended tracks 1—4 to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>single,</b> continuous piece, although they were broken up in the game; she intended tracks 20 and 21 the same way.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Hitchcock transitioned to Hollywood productions, {{the first}} of which was the {{psychological}} thriller Rebecca starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. He received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director, and the film won Best Picture. Hitchcock worked with Fontaine again the following year on the film Suspicion which also starred Cary Grant. In 1943 Hitchcock directed another psychological thriller Shadow of a Doubt which starred Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten. Three years later he reunited with Grant on Notorious which also starred Ingrid Bergman. The film included a three-minute intermittent kissing scene between the leads shot specifically to skirt the Motion Picture Production Code which at the time limited such scenes to three seconds. In 1948 Hitchcock directed Rope which starred James Stewart. The film was his first in Technicolor and is remembered for its use of long takes to make the film appear to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> continuous shot. Three years later he directed Strangers on a Train (1951).|$|E
5|$|Music {{from the}} series {{has also been}} played in {{specific}} Final Fantasy concerts and concert series. After {{the success of the}} 20020220 Music from Final Fantasy concert in 2002, a recording of which was produced as an album, the Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy, was launched in Japan in 2004. It was followed by the Dear Friends -Music from Final Fantasy- tour in the United States that same year, which was originally scheduled to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> concert but grew into a year-long tour. In 2005, a concert entitled More Friends: Music from Final Fantasy was performed to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the first Dear Friends concert and also had an album published of the performance. The latest Final Fantasy tour is the worldwide Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy tour, which began in Sweden in 2007 and still continues to date. A recording of its first performance was released as an album. Nobuo Uematsu additionally plays with The Black Mages, a band which performs Final Fantasy music in a rock music style. They have performed music live in concert, as well as with orchestras as part of various concert tours. They have released three albums to date, as well as DVDs of their live performances.|$|E
