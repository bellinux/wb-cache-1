These include breath-holding spells, bed wetting, night terrors, tics and shudder attacks. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause arching {{of the back}} and twisting of the {{head to the side}} in infants, which may be mistaken for tonic-clonic seizures.|$|E
5|$|Many modern {{birds are}} highly social, often found living in flocks. There is general {{agreement}} that some <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> common in birds, {{as well as}} in crocodiles (birds' closest living relatives), were also common among extinct dinosaur groups. Interpretations of behavior in fossil species are generally based on the pose of skeletons and their habitat, computer simulations of their biomechanics, and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{symptoms}} of low mood and energy, individuals with depression may {{be likely to}} have <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> counter to good sleep hygiene, such as taking naps during the day, consuming alcohol near bedtime, and consuming large amounts of caffeine during the day. In addition to sleep hygiene education, bright light therapy can be a useful treatment for individuals with depression. Not only can morning bright light therapy help establish a better sleep-wake schedule, {{but it also has}} been shown to be effective for treating depression directly, especially when related to seasonal affective disorder.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{evidence}} of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage {{in some form of}} social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed {{over a period of time}} using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.|$|E
25|$|Resilient {{children}} within classroom environments {{have been}} described as working and playing well and holding high expectations, have often been characterized using constructs such as locus of control, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and autonomy.

25|$|Job {{performance}} represents behaviors employees {{engage in}} while at work which contribute to organizational goals. These behaviors are formally evaluated by an organization {{as part of}} an employee's responsibilities. In order to understand and ultimately predict job performance, {{it is important to be}} precise when defining the term. Job performance is about <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> within the control of the employee and not about results (effectiveness), the costs involved in achieving results (productivity), the results that can be achieved in a period of time (efficiency), or the value an organization places on a given level of performance, effectiveness, productivity or efficiency (utility).|$|E
25|$|According to {{researchers}} the reward circuit is continuously involved in initiating <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{essential for the}} sustenance of the individual (such as eating) or of {{the preservation of the}} species (such as sexual reproduction). Food intake or sexual stimuli then lead to endorphine regulated release of dopamine in core substrates of the reward processing system, which subsequently activate craving sensations. The development of addictions is then directly related to the acquired or genetic abuse of the reward circuit. This finding then suggests that individuals with increased reward dependence have a relative deficit of endorphines and are possibly at higher risk for developing addictive behaviors.|$|E
25|$|There can be {{some issues}} of undetected {{behaviors}} {{in the case of}} behaviors that many people keep secret presently or in their earlier lives. They may not be as willing to reveal <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> discriminated against or stigmatized. If environment played no role in the actual behavior, skewed detection would still make it look like it played a role. For environment to appear to have no role in such cases, {{there would have to be}} either a counterproductivity of intolerance in the sense of intolerance causing the behavior it is bigoted against, or a flaw in the study that makes the results scientifically useless. Even if environment does play a role, the numbers would still be skewed.|$|E
5000|$|Operant {{conditioning}} (also, [...] "instrumental conditioning") is {{a learning}} {{process in which}} behavior is sensitive to, or controlled by its consequences.

25|$|Animals in zoos often exhibit <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{abnormal}} {{in their}} frequency, intensity, {{or would not}} normally be part of their behavioural repertoire. These are usually indicative of stress. For example, elephants sometimes perform head-bobbing, bears sometimes pace repeatedly around {{the limits of their}} enclosure, wild cats sometimes groom themselves obsessively, and birds pluck out their own feathers. Some critics of zoos claim that the animals are always under physical and mental stress, regardless of the quality of care towards the animals. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos.|$|E
25|$|Avatars {{may take}} any form users choose (human, animal, vegetable, mineral, or a {{combination}} thereof) or residents may choose to resemble themselves {{as they are in}} real life. They may choose even more abstract forms, given that almost every aspect of an avatar is fully customizable. Second Life Culture consists of many activities and <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> also present in real life. A single resident account may have only one avatar at a time, although the appearance of this avatar can change between as many different forms as the Resident wishes. Avatar forms, like almost everything else in Second Life, can be either created by the user, or bought pre-made. A single person may also have multiple accounts, and thus appear to be multiple Residents (a person's multiple accounts are referred to as alts).|$|E
25|$|Some {{disagree}} with these findings, {{arguing that the}} results of these tests are open to human interpretation and susceptible to the Clever Hans effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for primates, because primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged self-recognition behavior less certain. Skeptics argue that <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, and so researchers could be misinterpreting self-awareness for social responses to another individual. The researchers counter-argue that the behaviors shown are evidence of self-awareness, as they are very different from normal responses to another individual. Whereas apes can merely touch the mark on themselves with their fingers, cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness; they can only twist and turn themselves to observe the mark.|$|E

Whereas apes can merely touch the mark on themselves with their fingers, dolphins show less definitive behavior of self-awareness, twisting and turning themselves to observe the mark.|$|E
25|$|Louis Shuster and Nicholas Dodman {{noticed that}} dogs often {{demonstrate}} obsessive and compulsive behaviors similar to humans. Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) {{is not only}} specific only to certain breeds of dogs, but the breed may affect the specific types of compulsions. For example, bull terriers frequently exhibit obsessively predatory or aggressive behaviors. Breed may factor into the types of compulsions, but some behaviors are more common across the canine spectrum. Most commonly, CCD is seen in canines as they repeat behaviors such as chasing their tails, compulsively chewing on objects, or licking their paws excessively, similar to the common hand-washing compulsion many people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder have. Hallucinating and attacking the air around their head, {{as if there were}} a bug there, is another compulsion that has been seen in some dogs. Circling, hair biting, staring, and sometimes even barking are other examples of <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> considered compulsions in dogs when taken to extreme, repetitive actions.|$|E
25|$|Apparent {{correlation}} between heredity and {{behavior may be}} due to social stereotypes making people with certain physical characteristics (which may be hereditary physical characteristics) behave in certain ways, without any biological link between the genetic factor and the behavior. This violatates the equal environment assumption of twin design and suggests a stronger argument for environmental influences. This factor has an especially high likelihood of being the case for <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> culturally depicted in mass media as being more accepted by those who consider them to be biological than by those who consider them learned (e.g. sexuality and some psychiatric diagnoses) and for physical characteristics that are not culturally considered by mass media to be bigoted to associate with certain behaviors (e.g. not ethnic or racial). Such unequal environment biases may concentrate on {{a relatively small number of}} minor physical characteristics that are subject to stereotypes that are considered to be politically correct, with no statistically significant effect on overall ratings of physical similarity, let alone anywhere near being able to pass identical twins off as being fraternal.|$|E

Bourdieu claims that how one chooses to present one's social {{space to the}} world — one's aesthetic dispositions — depicts one's status and distances oneself from lower groups. Specifically, Bourdieu hypothesizes that children internalize these dispositions {{at an early age}} and that such dispositions guide the young towards their appropriate social positions, towards the <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> suitable for them, and foster an aversion towards other behaviors.|$|E
