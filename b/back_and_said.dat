500|$|Paltrow {{initially}} {{said about}} a possible return to Glee in its third season: [...] "No, I don't think so. I don't think I should. Though it's honestly {{been one of the}} best jobs I've ever had." [...] She did later state that she would love to come <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that Holly was [...] "probably the most fun character I've ever gotten to play". Murphy stated before the second season ended that he had plans for Paltrow to return in season three, though nothing specific has been mentioned {{since the beginning of the}} third season. Paltrow, however, was featured in [...] after being filmed while she performed [...] "Forget You" [...] as Holly in the 2011 Glee Live! In Concert! tour performances of June 16 and 17, 2011.|$|E
500|$|As {{an example}} of what Ornstein {{described}} as [...] "abstract music", his Sonata for Violin and Piano (1915; not 1913 as is often erroneously given) went even further; [...] "to the brink", as he put it: [...] "I would say that [...] had brought music just to the very edge.... I just simply drew <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'beyond that lies complete chaos. In 1916, critic Herbert F. Peyser declared that [...] "the world has indeed moved between the epoch of Beethoven and of Leo Ornstein." [...] That spring, Ornstein gave a series of recitals in the New York home of one of his advocates; these concerts were crucial precedents for the composer societies around which the modern music scene would thrive in the 1920s. Ornstein also traveled to New Orleans in 1916, where he discovered jazz. The following year, critic James Huneker wrote, ...|$|E
500|$|Work on Hooper's next film, The King's Speech, {{began in}} the same year. Hooper explained: [...] "It was a stage play, and my mother who's Australian was invited to a fringe [...] reading in London because she's part of the Australian community. The play's about the {{relationship}} between King George the Sixth and his Australian speech therapist. She came <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'you've got to read this play,' and I read it and it was brilliant ...". Hooper cast Colin Firth as George VI and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue and spent three weeks with the actors reading the script and rehearsing. Principal photography took place on location around the UK from November 2009 to January 2010. During editing, Hooper continued to consult with Firth and Rush by sending them cuts of the film and listening to their feedback.|$|E

6000|$|Having been {{supplied}} with these properties, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> farewell to Logan, Merton stole downstairs, walked round the house, entered the kitchen by the <b>back</b> door, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to Mrs. Bower, 'Grannie, I maun be ganging.' ...|$|R
500|$|I think that's bullshit. The word {{police can}} fuck off. I don't {{want to be}} policed! I'm not {{interested}} in political correctness. The word [...] "bitch" [...] means {{a lot of different}} things. Everything is about context. When I first moved to England and heard the word [...] "cunt", I was horrified. People were calling each other cunts! And then I realized that, in that culture, it was different—they slapped each other on the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Who's the cunt, right, you're my best mate!" [...] The word [...] "fuck" [...] doesn't just mean sexual intercourse. I mean, [...] "You're a stupid fuck," [...] "Are you going to fuck with me?" [...] "Fuck off!"... Sex {{has nothing to do with}} any of those expressions, and the same goes for [...] "bitch". If I say to you, [...] "I'm a badass bitch," [...] I'm owning myself, I'm saying, [...] "I'm strong, I'm tough, and don't mess with me." [...] If I say, [...] "Why are you being such a bitch to me?," [...] well, that means something else.|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{condition}} declined precipitously in September. Keyboardist Tony Brown {{remembers the}} singer's arrival at a University of Maryland concert: [...] "He {{fell out of}} the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, Is the tour gonna happen?" [...] Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, [...] "He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions". Wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in Detroit, [...] "I watched him in his dressing room, just draped over a chair, unable to move. So often I thought, 'Boss, why don't you just cancel this tour and take a year off...?' I mentioned something once in a guarded moment. He patted me on the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'It'll be all right. Don't you worry about it.'" [...] Presley continued to play to sellout crowds.|$|E
2500|$|The show's creators were {{initially}} refused {{permission to use}} [...] "Live and Let Die" [...] by Paul McCartney and Wings but, according to Graham in the Radio Times, [...] "We sent the episode directly to Paul McCartney. Almost immediately, his assistant phoned <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Paul loves it. You {{can go ahead and}} use it'".|$|E

6000|$|It {{was getting}} dark when Mrs. Farnam {{and the girl}} came <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> George <b>said,</b> [...] "Now I want to know all about your trip. Begin where you left the cars and go right on." ...|$|R
2500|$|Dr. Donna Nelson {{from the}} University of Oklahoma {{approached}} us several seasons <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I really like this show, {{and if you}} ever need help with the chemistry, I'd love to lend a hand." [...] She's been a wonderful advisor. We get help wherever we need it, whether it's chemistry, electrical engineering, or physics. We try to get everything correct. There's no full-time [...] on set, but we run certain scenes by these experts first.|$|E
2500|$|Gray {{revealed}} {{the most memorable}} thing anyone has said about her work {{in an interview at}} The Eternal Night, a book review site in Britain. Says Gray, [...] "Well, a few years ago, I submitted a story to an editor who wrote <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> it was the sickest thing she ever read, but then she said it was [...] "sick in the best sense of the word". I may be warped, but knowing that the editor had seen a lot of bizarre stuff in her career, I took her comment as a huge compliment, especially since the story was as psychological as it was gritty-physical. I went on to sell it elsewhere (twice!), and it received a Stoker recommendation, so I guess others thought it [...] "sick" [...] as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|After asking Wood who the [...] "coolest" [...] indie label was, Phair {{called up}} Gerard Cosloy, co-president of Matador Records, in 1992 {{and she asked}} him if he would put out her record. Coincidentally, Cosloy had just read a review of Girly Sound in Chemical Imbalance that very day and told Phair to send him a tape. Phair sent him a tape of six Girly Sound songs. Cosloy recalls: [...] "The songs were amazing. It was a fairly {{primitive}} recording, especially compared to the resulting album. The songs were really smart, really funny, and really harrowing, sometimes all at the same time[...] [...] [...] I liked it a lot and played it for everybody else. We usually don't sign people we haven't met, or heard other records by, or seen as performers. But I had a hunch, and I called her <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> O.K." ...|$|E
6000|$|He came <b>back</b> {{presently}} <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{his principal}} was charmed {{with the idea}} of brickbats at three-quarters of a mile, but must decline on account of the danger to disinterested parties passing between them. Then I said: ...|$|R

2500|$|This series saw {{the returns}} of Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry), Oliver Valentine (James Anderson) and Essie Harrison (Kaye Wragg). Henrik and Oliver were last seen in 2013, while Essie {{appeared}} on a recurring basis in 2014. She became a regular cast member upon her return in episode 26. Henrik returns to the hospital after deciding {{that he wants to}} [...] "bring his surgical brilliance back to Holby." [...] Henry expressed his delight at reprising his role, saying [...] "I'm so pleased to be reunited with Mr. Hanssen. He's such a weird and wonderful character to play - I've missed him! And the cast and crew at Holby are such fun to work with - I've missed them too." [...] While Anderson was equally pleased to be <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> there would be [...] "lots of surprises in store" [...] for Oliver. Oliver made his full-time return on 5 May 2015.|$|E
2500|$|She went up {{one story}} {{and stopped in}} between floors. The gentleman started to yell, [...] "What's wrong!" [...] I said, [...] "The {{elevator}} operator wants to kiss you." [...] Shocked, the gentleman said, [...] "But I'm a married man!" [...] The girl said, [...] "I don't mind that." [...] She walked toward him, and he stepped <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You start the elevator." [...] So she started it. She went up to about the fourth floor and stopped it again between floors. She said, [...] "I just have a craving for a kiss." [...] He said, [...] "You go about your business." [...] He wanted that elevator moving, not standing still. She replied, [...] "Well, let's go down {{and start all over}} again," [...] and she began to take the elevator down. He said, [...] "Not down, up!" [...] since he didn't want to go through that all over again.|$|E
2500|$|The chase {{was mostly}} led by [...] while [...] also chipped in. As the lead group {{continued}} to gain time, Busche told his teammate Voigt [...] "you look pretty good, why don't {{you go for}} the stage?". Voigt did exactly that and with [...] to race until the finish line he launched an attack {{that would not be}} nullified. He crossed the line in Avila Beach solo, registering his first victory of the year. The large group of escapees he was part of came in 6 seconds later, and the whole peloton a minute and seven seconds in arrears. The general classification was reshuffled, with Van Garderen taking the lead from Acevedo and Michael Rogers going from fifth to second. 41-year-old veteran Voigt said in his typical good humored fashion when interviewed after his victory: [...] "I just did the same move I've been doing since the ice age, and I couldn't believe they let me go. Once I get 20 seconds, I'm gone. I looked <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I can't believe they're giving me 20 seconds, don't they know?'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Future Animal Collective member Deakin (Josh Dibb) {{helped with}} the {{promotion}} and sent packages to record companies.

2500|$|Coonan {{revealed}} {{that in the}} run-up to his departure, Carl becomes a [...] "bit of a lone wolf" [...] after giving up trying to win Kirsty <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he has no friends because he has threatened everyone. Coonan shares scenes with actresses Samantha Womack, who plays Ronnie Mitchell, and Rita Simons, who plays Roxy Mitchell, but the actor explained that both characters realise that Carl is [...] "a bit too dark to get involved with" [...] and he is [...] "probably going a bit mad because he can't get Kirsty back". It was reported on 1 December 2013 that Roxy would [...] "seek solace" [...] in Carl after her marriage is annulled, but Shane Richie, who plays Roxy's ex-husband Alfie Moon, said Roxy is doing it because she has [...] "her freedom back—and she'll be throwing it in Alfie's face", despite being warned off Carl by Ronnie and Phil. Soaplife said that Roxy is [...] "hooked on the excitement of being with Carl." [...] Ronnie and Carl then start a feud, and it was reported that it would [...] "come to a head with some dark twists", and that [...] "One last showdown then sees Ronnie get rid of Carl forever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lu Su led his {{followers}} and some civilians southward to Juchao County to join Zhou Yu. He ordered able-bodied {{young men to}} guard the rear while the others moved ahead first. The local authorities sent some armed horsemen to stop Lu Su and his party from leaving. When the riders caught up with them, Lu Su turned <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You're all men of courage, so you should understand the situation well. The country {{is now in a}} state of chaos. You won't be rewarded for your efforts (even if you succeed in stopping us), but neither will you be punished if you don't pursue us. Do you really want to force us (to fight)?" [...] He then placed a shield upright on the ground and fired an arrow at it, piercing through the shield. The horsemen agreed with what Lu Su said and knew they could not stop him, so they gave up and left. Lu Su then crossed the Yangtze River with Zhou Yu and arrived in Jiangdong, where they met Sun Ce, who felt that Lu Su was a special person. Lu Su settled in Qu'e County (曲阿縣; in present-day Danyang, Jiangsu). When his grandmother died, he returned to Dongcheng County to attend her funeral.|$|E
2500|$|... “A baiji named Saraswatibai, {{renowned for}} her singing, {{had come from}} Kashi. We wanted {{to listen to her}} singing. She charged six hundred rupees for a single night’s performance. We sent Shyamsundar, “Go and bargain, see what you can manage.” Shyamsundar went and could fix her up for three hundred rupees. He came <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> “Three hundred rupees and two bottles of brandy.” On hearing about the brandy we were taken aback, mummy could object. Shyamsundar said, “She cannot sing without taking brandy.” Everything was ready. Saraswati entered the gathering. She was demure, round nosed, nothing great. Natore said, “Abanda, what have you done? Just thrown away three hundred rupees.” She was going to sing two songs. Natore was ready to {{accompany}} her on the mridangam. As the clock struck ten she started singing. One song and it was eleven at night. Natore was paralysed with the mridnagam in his lap. The wonderful voice of Saraswati reverberated around that dance-hall. How wonderfully she had tuned her voice. Some of us with pillows in our laps, others with hands close to our hearts, we were all wonderstruck. The gathering was won over with just one song. Everyone was still immersed in the song, when Saraswati said, “Aur kuch farmaiye.” (present your wish). After listening to her, no one dared to put anything forward. Then I told Shyamsundar, “Ask her to sing a bhajan. We have heard that bhajans of Kashi are very famous.” She sang a bhajan known to all, “Ao to Brajachandalal...” (Come oh, Lord!) Everybody was dumbfounded...|$|E

If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced {{you have a chance to}} swim to the other side." [...] The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town. On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear. [...] Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart to be used in the transplant attempt. The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. [...] When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique. [...] Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins. [...] Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard. Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, [...] "Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'It works.'" ...|$|E
