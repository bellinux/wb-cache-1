50|$|In February 1970, Bermuda {{converted}} from its former currency, the Bermudian pound, to a decimal currency, the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>dollar,</b> pegged to the U.S. dollar.|$|E
50|$|The Bermudian dollar (symbol: $; code: BMD; also {{abbreviated}} BD$; informally {{called the}} <b>Bermuda</b> <b>dollar)</b> {{is the official}} currency of the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda. It is subdivided into 100 cents. The Bermudian dollar is not normally traded outside of Bermuda, and is pegged to the United States dollar at a one-to-one ratio. Both currencies circulate in Bermuda on an equal basis.|$|E
5000|$|Following the US dollar {{crisis of}} 1971 which ended the {{international}} Bretton Woods agreement of 1944, the US dollar devalued, but the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>dollar</b> maintained its link to sterling. On 22 June 1972, the United Kingdom unilaterally ended its sterling area based exchange control laws, hence excluding Bermuda from its sterling area membership privileges. Bermuda responded on 30 June 1972 by amending its own exchange control laws accordingly, such as to impose exchange control restrictions {{in relation to}} Bermuda only. At the same time, Bermuda realigned its dollar back to one-to-one with the US dollar and formally pegged it to the US dollar at that rate. As far as United Kingdom law was concerned, Bermuda still remained {{a member of the}} overseas sterling area until exchange controls were abolished altogether in 1979.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was finally}} {{decided to take the}} action that British Honduras had already done 85 years earlier. In line with the {{international}} trend towards decimalization, Bermuda introduced a new currency {{in the form of a}} dollar that was fixed at an equal value to the US <b>dollar.</b> The new <b>Bermuda</b> <b>dollars</b> operated in conjunction with decimal fractional coinage, hence ending the pounds, shillings, and pence system in that colony in the year before it was ended in the United Kingdom itself. The decision to finally align with the US dollar was at least in part influenced by the devaluation of sterling in 1967 and Bermuda's increasing tendency to keep its reserves in US <b>dollars.</b> Although <b>Bermuda</b> changed to a U.S. based currency and changed the bulk of its reserves from sterling to U.S. dollars in 1970, it still nevertheless remained a member of the sterling area since at that time, the pound sterling and the US dollar had a fixed exchange rate of £1 = $2.40.|$|R
50|$|The pound {{sterling}} remained the official currency of Bermuda until 1970, though the Government of Bermuda did issue its own pound banknotes. With U.S. and Canadian coins regularly appearing in circulation in Bermuda {{and the possibility}} of the devaluation of the {{pound sterling}}, Bermuda was compelled to adopt its own decimal currency. On 6 February 1970, Bermuda introduced a new decimal currency {{in the form of a}} <b>dollar.</b> The nascent <b>Bermuda</b> <b>dollars</b> circulated in conjunction with the new British decimal coinage a year before it was introduced in the United Kingdom. By adopting decimalisation early, Bermuda was also able place orders for the coinage from the Royal Mint before other Commonwealth countries seeking to decimalise could. The link between the Bermudian dollar and the pound sterling was not broken until 31 July 1972, which allowed Bermuda to align to a one-to-one exchange rate with that of the United States. The decision for Bermuda to peg its dollar to the U.S. dollar added convenience for the multitude of American tourists and businesses with whom Bermuda largely relied on.|$|R
25|$|A {{triangular}} coin with a {{face value}} of £5 (produced to commemorate the 2007/2008 Tutankhamun exhibition at The O2 Arena) was commissioned by the Isle of Man: it became legal tender on 6 December 2007. Other triangular coins issued earlier include: Cabinda coin, <b>Bermuda</b> coin, 2 <b>Dollar</b> Cook Islands 1992 triangular coin, Uganda Millennium Coin and Polish Sterling-Silver 10-Zloty Coin.|$|R
50|$|In 1825, an {{imperial}} Order-in-Council was passed {{for the purposes}} of introducing the British coinage into all the British colonies. It wasn't immediately very effective due to unrealistic ratings, and it required a further Order-in-Council to be passed in 1838. By {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century, British coinage had replaced the Spanish dollar throughout all of the British West Indies. But it was only in the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Jamaica that the pound unit of account was used. In the Eastern Caribbean territories and in British Guiana, the dollar unit of account was retained in conjunction with the British coinage at a fixed rate of one dollar equal to four shillings and two pence. Unlike in <b>Bermuda,</b> the US <b>dollar</b> circulated freely alongside the British sterling coinage in the Bahamas.|$|R
40|$|The {{hurricane}} season of 1953 was about normal {{in the number}} of storms, with a total of eight. Four reached the coast of the United States, but only two of them were of hurricane force and these were not particularly severe. This resulted in only one death and damage estimated at about $ 6, 000, 000. Hurricane Carol did $ 1, 000, 000 damages to fishing craft along the New England coast and caused some destruction in the Canadian Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Edna caused quite a lot of damage at <b>Bermuda,</b> but no <b>dollar</b> estimates have been received. In addition to the wind damage, storm Hazel, that crossed southern Florida October 9, produced heavy rains which added to the flooded conditions in the river valleys of central and northeastern Florida, but it was not possibl...|$|R
