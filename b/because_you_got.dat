500|$|After the races, {{there was}} {{continued}} discussion about overheating engines in high temperatures. Harvick said the temperatures of around [...] had affected the racing, [...] the grills were [...] "too tight" [...] and competitors chose {{to remain in}} a single-file formation because of overheating. Smith said he believed there was no efficient method of tackling the problem. McMurray advocated the widening of the grille, saying, [...] "it was {{a little hard to}} race <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> too hot". One day after the second race, NASCAR announced that no further changes would be made.|$|E
500|$|From {{the age of}} thirteen, Mitchell {{was educated}} at Abingdon School, a public school in Oxfordshire. Having always been top of the class at Primary school and Prep school, once he moved to Abingdon, he {{realised}} that {{there were plenty of}} people more intelligent than he was; so he turned his attention to debating and drama, [...] "where [...] had a chance of being the best". There, Mitchell often took part in plays, [...] "largely <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to play cards backstage." [...] His roles mainly consisted of small minute-long parts, until he won the role of Rabbit in Winnie-the-Pooh. This {{was the first time that}} he was [...] "consciously aware I was doing a performance" [...] and that that [...] "was better, even, than playing cards." [...] Mitchell had been [...] "obsessed" [...] with comedy writing since his school days, as he [...] "always felt that doing a joke was the cleverest thing", and [...] "would intrinsically prefer a parody of something to the actual thing itself".|$|E
500|$|In the verses, Spears is {{flirting with}} a guy, in lyrics such as [...] "Look at you/Look at you/Be my sweetie/Be my honey tonight/Look at you/Look at you/Be my sweetie/Be my honey tonight/'Cause you're beautiful/Drop dead". Sabi rap's also {{alludes to the}} theme of the song, with lines such as [...] "I think I like you/Boy, boy, look at you/I want to get next to you/Got me kind of hot but I ain't {{sweating}} you/Steaming like a pot full of vegetables". Spears references The Notorious B.I.G.'s hit [...] "Hypnotize" [...] in [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] in the line [...] "You must be B.I.G. <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> me Hypnotized". Spears' vocals on [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] were deemed as [...] "robotic", but similar to the ones of [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] (2000). Jocelyn Vena of MTV noted the singer uses her deep vocals in lines such as [...] "And, yeah, your body looks so sick, I think I caught the flu" [...] and [...] "You must be B.I.G. 'cause you got me hypnotized".|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Paul Hunter, known {{for his work on}} previous Michael Jackson and TLC clips. However, for unknown reasons, the video was scrapped, and Hilson re-shot a clip for the video with [...] "Knock You Down" [...] and [...] "Number One" [...] director Chris Robinson. Robinson told Rap-Up, [...] "Keri Hilson has a great personality and is a real girl. That’s what we want to get across." [...] He also talked about the premise and plot of the video, stating that the video portrays Hilson as a woman who doesn't take herself seriously, commenting, [...] "It’s a really sexy song, but we don’t want to fall into the typical love, love, love R vibe with that... it starts where you think, ‘Oh, it’s about her and being sexy.' She’s in her house and by herself, and you kind of think it could be serious, but the song drops out in the middle and her friends catch her being all sexy, basically like, ‘What the f**k [...] are you doing? You are not singing by yourself.’" [...] In an interview with That Grape Juice, when asked about the video and on the sensuality of the live performances compared to video, Hilson responded, [...] "Yeah. It is a bit of that, but it’s a bit toned down for the video, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> so much censoring, I can’t do everything I do on stage (laughs). So when people come out they’re probably still gonna be a bit surprised to see it live, after seeing the video. But I’m very pleased with the video. I love the colours and it’s reminiscent of the whole late 70s early 80s era in music." [...] Chris Brown, Omarion, Monica, Melody Thornton, and Polow Da Don all appear in the video. The video begins with Hilson, dressed lavishly, arriving late to a Jeep full of the previous stated people. The clip flips back to what happened earlier that night, showing Hilson getting ready in a seductive fashion, as she chooses perfume and picks out clothes. Scenes of Hilson performing in front of a leather-like wall are interspersed in between her and her friends riding down a boulevard to the club. Once she arrives to the club, she is attracted to a particular man, and subsequently performs elaborate, sensual choreography with him and other dancers, before slow dancing. VIBE said, [...] "Keri Hilson is fine as wine. You know it. We know it. And she knows it. But for the doubters, she proves it once again with this seductive new video from In A Perfect World." [...] A writer for Rap-Up said that Hilson, [...] "takes it nice and slow in the video for 'Slow Dance.'" [...] The video ranked at number 80 on [...] Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E

5000|$|Dave Moody of the Motor Racing Network {{said that}} because fans and drivers don't want NASCAR to show {{discretion}} but enforce down to {{the letter of the}} law, they should [...] "be careful what <b>you</b> wish for. <b>Because</b> <b>you</b> just <b>got</b> it." ...|$|R

60|$|The truly quaint materialism of {{our view}} of life {{disables}} us from pursuing any transaction to an end. You can make no one understand that his bargain is {{anything more than a}} bargain, whereas in point of fact it is a link in the policy of mankind, and either a good or an evil to the world. We have a sort of blindness which prevents us from seeing anything but sovereigns. If one man agrees to give another so many shillings for so many hours' work, and then wilfully gives him a certain proportion of the price in bad money and only the remainder in good, we can see with half an eye that this man is a thief. But if the other spends a certain proportion of the hours in smoking a pipe of tobacco, and a certain other proportion in looking at the sky, or the clock, or trying to recall an air, or in meditation on his own past adventures, and only the remainder in downright work such as he is paid to do, is he, because the theft is one of time and not of money,--is he any the less a thief? The one gave a bad shilling, the other an imperfect hour; but both broke the bargain, and each is a thief. In piecework, which is what most of us do, the case is none the less plain for being even less material. If you forge a bad knife, you have wasted some of mankind's iron, and then, with unrivalled cynicism, you pocket some of mankind's money for your trouble. Is there any man so blind who cannot see that this is theft? Again, if you carelessly cultivate a farm, you have been playing fast and loose with mankind's resources against hunger; there will be less bread in consequence, and for lack of that bread somebody will die next winter: a grim consideration. And you must not hope to shuffle out of blame <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> less money for your less quantity of bread; for although a theft be partly punished, it is none the less a theft for that. You took the farm against competitors; there were others ready to shoulder the responsibility and be answerable for the tale of loaves; but it was you who took it. By the act you came under a tacit bargain with mankind to cultivate that farm with your best endeavour; you were under no superintendence, you were on parole; and you have broke your bargain, and to all who look closely, and yourself among the rest if you have moral eyesight, you are a thief. Or take the case of men of letters. Every piece of work which is not as good as you can make it, which you have palmed off imperfect, meagrely thought, niggardly in execution, upon mankind who is your paymaster on parole and in a sense your pupil, every hasty or slovenly or untrue performance, should rise up against you in the court of your own heart and condemn you for a thief. Have you a salary? If you trifle with your health, and so render yourself less capable for duty, and still touch, and still greedily pocket the emolument--what are you but a thief? Have you double accounts? do you by any time-honoured juggle, deceit, or ambiguous process, gain more from those who deal with you than if you were bargaining and dealing face to face in front of God?--What are you but a thief? Lastly, if you fill an office, or produce an article, which, in your heart of hearts, you think a delusion and a fraud upon mankind, and still draw your salary and go through the sham manoeuvres of this office, or still book your profits and keep on flooding the world with these injurious goods?--though you were old, and bald, and the first at church, and a baronet, what are you but a thief? These may seem hard words and mere curiosities of the intellect, in an age when the spirit of honesty is so sparingly cultivated that all business is conducted upon lies and so-called customs of the trade, that not a man bestows two thoughts on the utility or honourableness of his pursuit. I would say less if I thought less. But looking to my own reason and the right of things, I can only avow that I am a thief myself, and that I passionately suspect my neighbours of the same guilt.|$|E
