This way of determining stage temperatures is more applicable for wide boiling range mixtures, while that used by Holland is more applicable for a narrow boiling range mixture. The proposed method was utilized for a distillation column (employing a relatively narrow boiling range feed) and for both absorbers and strippers (employing relatively wide boiling range feeds). The absorber and stripper problems yielded good results; however, in. a problem with wide boiling mixtures, the round-off error which arises in the solution of the mate¬ rial balance equations becomes significant. This error was effectively eliminated by performing a top-down calculation for the light components, and a <b>bottom-up</b> <b>calculation</b> for the heavy components.

Targeted at this matter, this article develops a <b>bottom-up</b> <b>calculation</b> and scenario analysis model to estimate CO 2 emissions and reduction potentials for China&# 39;s primary aluminum industry. In this model, the complex structures of feedstock, technology and electric power are completely considered. CO 2 emissions from alumina and aluminum production in the selected year are calculated using this model, and emissions associated with five distinct refining technologies and smelters in the six regional power grids are examined in detail. Results show that CO 2 emissions of primary aluminum production in China could decrease at various extents through implementing alternative countermeasures for ore quality changes and policies adjustment in the future. It&# 39;s expected that wide adoption of SBSP and IBP as well as further elirriination of LSSP and SPCP have a reduction potential of 6 %, which is almost equivalent to the cutting effect of SBP domination.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is three-fold. First, it maps the delivery structure for on-street consignees and consignees located at shopping centers. In general, micro-data regarding urban freight is sparse, thus this survey greatly contributes to the general knowledge about number of deliveries and number of freight vehicles in Oslo. This information is important to take into account for <b>bottom-up</b> <b>calculations</b> of traffic impacts. This includes private costs of freight, but also socio-economic external costs related to local and global emissions, noise, increased congestion and increased chances of traffic accidents. Second, through surveys amongst employees and drivers, car counts and GPS data, we have identified and quantified an important cost difference between on-street consignees and consignees at shopping centers, namely the increased cost due to lower capacity for on-street consignees. The expected additional cost per vehicle related to low capacity is estimated to be NOK 49 (the additional cost per delivery will obviously depend on number of deliveries per vehicle). This is important information from a policy perspective, and suggests that both (1) increasing capacity for on-street deliveries in the city center and (2) facilitating for shopping centers with dedicated unloading spaces will reduce both private costs for transport operators and consignees, and external costs related to emissions and congestion. Third, we give recommendations for mitigating the problem of space restrictions for on-street deliveries in the city center. This approach consist of two elements: (1) deliveries before or after stores’ opening hours and (2) deliveries to a buffer storage location with a dedicated unloading space...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} the Swedish Programme for improving energy efficiency in energy-intensive industries (PFE). Since 2005, some 100 energy-intensive companies have entered this five year voluntary agreement (VA) and been exempted from the EU minimum tax on electricity. In return, each company is required to: conduct an energy audit and analysis; identify {{and invest in}} profitable electricity saving measures; implement and certify an energy management system; introduce routines for energy efficient procurement and project planning. For most participants the first programme period was completed in 2009 and available data enables this PFE ex-post evaluation. An impact evaluation compiles and analyse data that the companies have reported to the administrating agency, the Swedish Energy Agency (SEA). This assessment of quantifiable results is complemented by a process-oriented approach that combines studies of policy documents, previous evaluations and personal communication with administrators as well as companies. The <b>bottom-up</b> <b>calculation</b> method distinguishes between gross and net impact. While the SEA estimates a gross impact of 1450 GWh/year the net impact consists of an interval between 689 and 1015 GWh of net annual electricity savings.

Two air quality simulations (4 km x 4 km, 1 h) were performed for February and June 2009, using the CALIOPE-AQFS system (WRF-ARW/HERMESv 2. 0 /CMAQ/BSC-DREAM 8 b) differing only by the vertical allocation of point source emissions: i) using fixed vertical profiles based on the stack height of each facility and ii) using an hourly <b>bottom-up</b> <b>calculations</b> of effective emission heights. When using plume rise calculations, emissions are generally allocated to lower altitudes than when using the fixed vertical profiles, showing significant differences depending on source sector and air pollutant (up to 75 % between estimated average effective emission heights). In terms of air quality, it is shown that hourly plume rise calculations lead to improved simulation of industrial SO 2 concentrations, thus increasing modelled concentrations (1. 4 mu g m(- 3) increase in February, 1. 5 mu g m(- 3) increase in June) and reducing the model biases for both months (31. 1 % in February, 73. 7 % in June). The increase of SO 2 concentrations leads to an increase of SO 4 - 2 surface levels that varies according to the season and location (4. 3 % in February and 0. 4 % in June, on average). On the other hand, the impact on NO 2 and PM 10 concentrations is less significant, leading to average changes of a few mu g. m(3) at most (0. 4 mu g m(- 3) for NO 2 and 0. 2 mu g m(- 3) for PM 10). In order to maximize the precision of plume rise calculations, the use of stack parameters based on real-world data is mandatory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Disagreement {{over the}} costs of actions to address climate change is a barrier to {{implementing}} effective policies. In this thesis, I focus on two particularly controversial actions: accelerating natural rates of improvement in energy efficiency and increasing carbon sequestration in forests. Analysts using {{what is known as}} the conventional bottom-up approach find that each of these actions can achieve substantial mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions at low costs. The prospect of combining low-cost actions with politically feasible policies, such as subsidies and information programs, is particularly enticing for policy-makers. However, actions that appear to be cost-effective based on conventional <b>bottom-up</b> <b>calculations</b> are not necessarily widely adopted – in the energy efficiency literature, this is referred to as the energy efficiency “gap”. There are two serious problems associated with the conventional bottom-up methodology. First, conventional bottom-up analysis ignores important aspects of human behavior and therefore does not take into account some of the real costs associated with actions. This explains to some degree the “gap” described above. Second, key feedback effects within the economy are not represented in bottom-up models. The energy efficiency “rebound effect” and the analogous phenomenon of “leakage” in forest carbon sequestration each reduce the initial effectiveness of the action in question. As a result of these deficiencies, conventional bottom-up models are likely to underestimate the cost of the actions in question and suggest inappropriate policy responses to rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. In the three papers comprising my PhD thesis, I develop and apply new models to test the findings of the bottom-up approach. These models incorporate empirically estimated behavioral parameters and have the capability to (where necessary) take into account feedback effects within the economy. My research suggests that neither energy efficiency nor forest carbon sequestration is the “magic bullet” against climate change. Subsidy programs designed to achieve these actions – including subsidies in the form of offsets – would require large public expenditures, especially due to free-rider problems. To successfully meet the challenge of climate change, policy-makers must implement broad-based policies that impose a substantial financial or regulatory constraint on greenhouse gas emissions...|$|E
30|$|Beth et al. [14] first {{proposed}} a trust measurement method under open network environment. In their work, trust {{is regarded as}} direct trust and recommendation trust, and a probabilistic method is adopted to represent trust. The PeerTrust model [15] uses the transaction and the community background {{as the source of}} reputation feedback. It can act as a defense against some of the subtle malicious attacks, e.g., a seller develops a good reputation by being honest for small transactions and tries to make a big profit by being dishonest for large transactions. The EigenRep model [16] assumes that if the direct trust between a node and the destination node is higher, the recommendation trust is more reliable. The model uses direct trust to calculate the global trust. This model can effectively solve the bad effect caused by the malicious recommendation. Wang et al. [17] proposed a trust model based on Bayesian network. This model investigates how to describe different aspects of trust to obtain various properties of entities according to different scenes. Wang et al. [18] solved the problem of recommendation trust based on the Bayesian method. This method calculates recommendation trust based on experts’ experience. Lu et al. [19] proposed an evaluation method of software reliability. It is a <b>bottom-up</b> <b>calculation</b> process of trust level that can decompose and synthetically derive a parallel structure, so that the trust value of a system can be calculated accurately. However, there are still some shortages about this kind of models. They only adopt probabilistic model to establish subjective trust model. In other words, subjectivity and uncertainty of trust are equivalent to randomness. They also adopt the averaging method to calculate recommendation trust, which cannot reflect the real situations of a trust relationship.|$|R
40|$|Summary Transport systems face {{significant}} input- and output-related {{challenges in}} the upcoming decades. To tackle climate change – the major output challenge - an 80 % CO 2 reduction has to be achieved by 2050 (base year 1990). This requires a sustainability transition to low-CO 2 passenger mobility and freight transport. Problem shifting – the occurrence of unintended/indirect consequences – is expected, if the sustainability transition is not properly governed. The results are potential societal disruptions and/or resource scarcity impacts. This study assesses CO 2 reduction measures for the Dutch transport system concerning their unintended consequences and describes policy implications as an essential pre-condition for a future-proof transport system. The following methodology has been applied: 1. 	Identification of potential measures to reduce CO 2 emissions in Dutch transport 2. 	Qualitative assessment of all measures concerning their indirect consequences 3. 	Quantification of scenario-specific unintended consequences through application of a <b>bottom-up</b> <b>calculation</b> model (assessment of five published strategies) 4. 	Development of optimized long-term strategy to minimize and balance unintended consequences of CO 2 reduction in Dutch transport All identified measures generate multiple unintended consequences – varying in quality and scale. The severity of unintended consequences depends on different inter-connected aspects, such as the scale of implemented measures, the combination of different measures and the socio-economic and cultural context. The assessment of five recently published strategies on CO 2 reduction in transport has shown that societal disruption and/or resource scarcity might occur, if transport governance is based on these publications. This {{is due to the}} limited scope of these publications. Furthermore, trade-offs are identified, which give guidance to policy-makers about potential key elements in transport governance. This implies that transport governance has to become aware on unintended consequences. The broadened approach chosen in this study has identified the following criteria as important for sustainable transport governance: costs, WTW-energy, infrastructure (transport and energy), land-use, natural resources, social impacts and social acceptance. Unintended consequences have to be politically managed through well-adjusted and context-specific measure combinations, preferably backed up with long-term strategic planning. Modelling results show that the successful management of unintended consequences is possible through re-organizing transportation systems in combination with long-term technology change. Modal shifts (through organizational measures) and transport demand reduction (through behavioural measures) {{play a key role in}} reducing CO 2 sustainably. Re-organizing transport to more energy-efficient means should get the highest priority, as it has proven to generate the least indirect impacts. The management of intended (CO 2 mitigation) and unintended consequences requires significant cross-sectorial policy coordination in the near future to achieve a sustainably “sound” transport system by 2050. This study is considered as a methodologically new approach to include additional criteria for the development of sustainable transportation. The developed optimized scenario “Organization first” should be considered as a valid basis for further discussions on controlling unintended consequences of transport-related CO 2 reduction in transport. ...|$|R

Washing machines, performing this task already in many private households, are now responsible for about 2 % of the global electricity consumption. Worldwide, more than 840 million domestic washing machines are in use, with an annual consumption exceeding 92 TWh of electricity and 19 billion m 3 of water as well as causing emissions of more than 62 megatons CO 2 eq. In North America, Western Europe and Pacific OECD countries, most households own a washing machine. In these economies standard and label policy programs already addressed and reduced the specific electricity and water consumption of washing machines per wash cycle. Nevertheless, in other world regions, the level of ownership for washing machines is still well below saturation and high growth rates can be observed in developing and newly industrialising countries. As washing machines use water, electricity, chemical substances and process time as resources, also the absolute worldwide resource consumption and emissions of these appliances are still on the rise. Due to different washing habits and practices as well as types of washing machines in different world regions, the specific consumption of resources for doing the laundry is varying to a large extent.

Based on this first experience, the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) formed in 2008 a working group for {{the development of}} the new and more specific South African National Standard SANS 941. This standard identifies energy efficiency requirements, labelling and measurement methods as well as the maximum allowable standby power for a set of appliances as reliable basis for introducing a mandatory regulation. Nevertheless, due to many existing barriers, such as lack of funding and low priority assigned to the initiative, a very long period passed by between the S&L planning and final policy implementation.

To analyse the effectiveness of the new S&L programme and the potential influence of delays in the implementing process, the authors performed an immediate first-hand evaluation of the new policy. As analytical reference base for available energy efficiency potentials, results from <b>bottom-up</b> scenario <b>calculations</b> will be presented exemplarily as case study for cold appliances covered by the S&L programme.

Both models draw data from a common database for describing the device geometry and the production environment. The method is used to evaluate the manufacturing plan for a microchannel heat exchanger, providing insight into the likely drivers of cost and environmental impact. For this case study, the analysis shows that both cost and environmental impact are dominated by the same process step – diffusion bonding...|$|R
