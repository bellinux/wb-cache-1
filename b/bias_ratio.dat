2500|$|Another {{focus of}} the B7 RS 4 was on the {{introduction}} of the latest development of Audi's 'trademark' quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. [...] This utilised the 'third generation' asymmetric/dynamic Torsen T-3 'automatic torque biasing' (ATB) centre differential, featuring a 'default' 40:60 front-to-rear torque split under normal conditions. [...] Audi stressed that this would result in a more neutral response in corners, and a more dynamic driving experience. [...] Also, a more aggressive Torque <b>Bias</b> <b>Ratio</b> (TBR) was used, and set to 4:1, as opposed to 2:1 (and later variants 3:1 TBR) on standard A4. [...] That means that one side of the differential can handle up to 80%, while the other side would have to only handle 20% of applied torque.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bias</b> <b>ratio</b> {{measures}} how far {{the returns}} from an investment portfolio - e.g. one managed by a hedge fund - are from an unbiased distribution. Thus the <b>bias</b> <b>ratio</b> of a pure equity index will usually be close to 1. However, if a fund smooths its returns using subjective pricing of illiquid assets the <b>bias</b> <b>ratio</b> will be higher. As such, it can help identify the presence of illiquid securities where they are not expected.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bias</b> <b>ratio</b> {{was first}} defined by Adil Abdulali, a risk {{manager at the}} {{investment}} firm Protégé Partners. The Concepts behind the <b>Bias</b> <b>Ratio</b> were formulated between 2001 and 2003 and privately used to screen money managers. The first public discussions on the subject took place in 2004 at New York University's Courant Institute and in 2006 at Columbia University. In 2006, the <b>Bias</b> <b>Ratio</b> was published {{in a letter to}} Investors and made available to the public by Riskdata, a risk management solution provider, that included it in its standard suite of analytics.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Bias</b> <b>Ratio</b> is {{also useful}} to detect {{illiquid}} assets forensically. The table above offers some useful benchmarks. If a database search for Long/Short Equity managers reveals a fund with a reasonable {{history and a}} <b>Bias</b> <b>Ratio</b> greater than 2.5, detailed diligence will no doubt reveal some fixed income or highly illiquid equity investments in the portfolio.|$|E
50|$|Ideally, a Hedge Fund {{investor}} would {{examine the}} price of each individual underlying asset that comprises a manager’s portfolio. With limited transparency, this ideal falls short in practice, furthermore, even with full transparency, time constraints prohibit the plausibility of this ideal, rendering the <b>Bias</b> <b>Ratio</b> more efficient to highlight problems. The <b>Bias</b> <b>Ratio</b> {{can be used to}} differentiate among a universe of funds within a strategy. If a fund has a <b>Bias</b> <b>Ratio</b> above the median level for the strategy, perhaps {{a closer look at the}} execution of its pricing policy is warranted; whereas, well below the median might warrant only a cursory inspection.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bias</b> <b>ratio</b> {{was created}} by Adil Abdulali, risk Manager at Protégé Partners and client of Riskdata. This risk indicator, {{integrated}} in Riskdata's products, helps in monitoring hedge funds and completing due diligence by detecting manipulation of the Net Asset Value (NAV) when illiquid securities are involved. In 2007, the <b>Bias</b> <b>ratio</b> indicator allowed Riskdata’s clients to raise a red flag on Madoff funds before fraud is discovered.|$|E

40|$|Although {{dioecious}} {{species are}} rare in nature, the sexual system {{appears in a}} diverse number of families and across all life forms and global locations. We looked at the population dynamics of natural populations to determine why many dioecious populations display <b>biased</b> sex <b>ratios.</b> We also looked at the role incestuous matings, seed and pollen dispersal patterns, and compensation play {{in the evolution of}} this sexual system using two theoretical models we developed. Finally, we studied aspen populations in the Midwest to determine how climate variables affect growth and decline. We found many dioecious species display male <b>biased</b> <b>ratios</b> and that life form and dispersal agents are good indicators. Our theoretical models imply that incest and dispersal specialization of unisexual individuals facilitate invasion, but through the interaction of specialization, incest, and compensation, unisexual invasion occurs much more consistently and under less stringent conditions then previously modeled. Finally, we found that declining aspen stands were much less responsive to climate variables than healthy stands and that a number of stand characteristics could be used to discriminate between responsive and non-responsive stands...|$|R
40|$|The {{epidemiology}} and genetic variability of 2 parasitic nematodes Heligmosomoides polygyrus and Syphacia stroma of Apodemus spp. were investigated. Both are parasites {{of the same}} host, exhibit a direct life-cycle and are dioecious. However, H. polygyrus has a diploid and S. stroma a haplodiploid mode of reproduction. Haplodiploidy {{may lead to a}} more female <b>biased</b> sex <b>ratio</b> and reduced genetic variability. Levels of genetic diversity were analysed using both isoenzyme electrophoresis and RAPDs (random amplified polymorphic DNA). Both parasites showed a female <b>biased</b> sex <b>ratio</b> with a stronger bias for the haplodiploid parasite. Results showed significantly fewer genetic polymorphisms as measured bq RAPDs for the haplodiploid parasite S. stroma in comparison with H. polygyrus. Despite the observed female <b>biased</b> sex <b>ratio</b> this could not be explained by a significant amount of inbreeding. Heterozygote deficiency for individual allozyme loci - which could indicate inbreeding - was not found in either parasite species.

40|$|Sex {{determination}} is {{a fundamental}} process governed by diverse mechanisms. Sex ratio selection is commonly implicated {{in the evolution of}} sex-determining systems, although formal models are rare. Here, we argue that, although sex ratio selection can induce shifts in sex determination, genomic conflicts between parents and offspring can explain why single-factor systems (e. g. XY/ XX or ZW/ZZ) are common even in species that experience selection for <b>biased</b> sex <b>ratios.</b> Importantly, evolutionary shifts in sex determination do not always result in the biased production of sons and daughters sensu sex ratio theory. Thus, equal sex ratios might be an emergent character of sex-determining systems even when <b>biased</b> sex <b>ratios</b> are favored by selection...|$|R

We derived the achievable data rates for AWGN channel as well as frequency-selective channel scenarios. We investigated the trade-off between the optical power constraint and distortion.

5000|$|The <b>Bias</b> <b>Ratio</b> gives {{a strong}} {{indication}} {{of the presence of}} a) illiquid assets in a portfolio combined with b) a subjective pricing policy. Most of the valuation-related hedge fund debacles have exhibited high Bias Ratios. However, the converse is not always true. Often managers have legitimate reasons for subjective pricing, including restricted securities, Private Investments in public equities, and deeply distressed securities. Therefore, it would be unwise to use the <b>Bias</b> <b>Ratio</b> as a stand-alone due diligence tool. In many cases, the author has found that the subjective policies causing high Bias Ratios also lead to [...] "conservative" [...] pricing that would receive higher grades on a [...] "prudent man" [...] test than would an un-biased policy. Nevertheless, the coincidence of historical blow-ups with high Bias Ratios encourages the diligent investor to use the tool as a warning flag to investigate the implementation of a manager’s pricing policies.|$|E
50|$|Serial {{correlations}} {{appear in}} many cases that are likely {{not the result of}} willful manipulation but rather the result of stale prices and illiquid assets. Both Sun Asia and Plank are emerging market hedge funds for which the author has full transparency and whose NAVs are based on objective prices. However, both funds show significant serial correlation. The presence of serial correlation in several market indices such as the JASDAQ and the SENSEX argues further that serial correlation might be too blunt a tool for uncovering manipulation. However the two admitted frauds, namely Bayou, an Equity fund and Safe Harbor, an MBS fund (Table IV shows the critical <b>Bias</b> <b>Ratio</b> values for these strategies) are uniquely flagged by the <b>Bias</b> <b>Ratio</b> in this sample set with none of the problems of false positives suffered by the serial correlation metric. The Bias Ratio’s unremarkable values for market indices, adds further credence to its effectiveness in detecting fraud.|$|E

50|$|The Bias Ratios {{of market}} and hedge fund indices gives {{some insight into}} the natural shape of returns near zero. Theoretically one would not expect demand for markets with {{normally}} distributed returns around a zero mean. Such markets have distributions with a <b>Bias</b> <b>Ratio</b> of less than 1.0. Major market indices support this intuition and have Bias Ratios generally greater than 1.0 over long time periods. The returns of equity and fixed income markets as well as alpha generating strategies have a natural positive skew that manifests in a smoothed return histogram as a positive slope near zero. Fixed income strategies with a relatively constant positive return ("carry") also exhibit total return series with a naturally positive slope near zero. Cash investments such as 90-day T-Bills have large Bias Ratios, because they generally do not experience periodic negative returns. Consequently, the <b>Bias</b> <b>Ratio</b> is less reliable for the theoretic hedge fund that has an un-levered portfolio with a high cash balance.Due diligence, due to the inverted x and y axes, involves manipulation and instigation and extortion etc.|$|E

On the other hand, the Lehman Aggregate MBS Index had a <b>Bias</b> <b>Ratio</b> of 2.16, while MBS hedge funds may have Bias Ratios from a respectable 1.7 to an astounding 31.0, with an average of 7.7 and standard deviation of 7.5.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There {{has been}} a {{considerable}} increase in studies investigating rates of diversification and character evolution, {{with one of the}} promising techniques being the BiSSE method (binary state speciation and extinction). This study uses simulations under a variety of different sample sizes (number of tips) and asymmetries of rate (speciation, extinction, character change) to determine BiSSE’s ability to test hypotheses, and investigate whether the method is susceptible to confounding effects. Results We found that the power of the BiSSE method is severely affected by both sample size and high tip <b>ratio</b> <b>bias</b> (one character state dominates among observed tips). Sample size and high tip <b>ratio</b> <b>bias</b> also reduced accuracy and precision of parameter estimation, and resulted in the inability to infer which rate asymmetry caused the excess of a character state. In low tip <b>ratio</b> <b>bias</b> scenarios with appropriate tip sample size, BiSSE accurately estimated the rate asymmetry causing character state excess, avoiding the issue of confounding effects. Conclusions Based on our findings, we recommend that future studies utilizing BiSSE that have fewer than 300 terminals and/or have datasets where high tip <b>ratio</b> <b>bias</b> is observed (i. e., fewer than 10 % of species are of one character state) should be extremely cautious with the interpretation of hypothesis testing results. </p...|$|R
