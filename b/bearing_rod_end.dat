The most probable reason for non-uniform contact at the bearing interface appears to be due to improper staking of the <b>bearing</b> into the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> top bore. It is recommended that the alignment and pressure calibration of the press, and geometry and dimensions of the staking tools be checked and corrective measures incorporated to avoid improper assembly.

5000|$|While in {{automotive}} parlance {{the term}} [...] "ball joint" [...] usually {{refers to the}} primary ball joint connections {{at the ends of}} the control arms, this type of joint is used in other parts as well, including tie <b>rod</b> <b>ends.</b> In these other applications, they are typically called tie <b>rod</b> <b>ends</b> or, when they are an inner tie <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> on a rack-and-pinion steering system, they are called inner socket assemblies. These joints are also used {{in a number of other}} non-automotive applications, from the joints of dolls to other mechanical linkages for a variety of devices, or any place where a degree of rotation in movement is desired.|$|R
40|$|Main and {{connecting}} <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> along the crankshaft in a heavy-duty engine oil system requires efficient feed of oil flow {{to ensure the}} performance of lubrication, cooling and cleaning. The bearings and builded bearing models considered in this work {{are based on a}} Volvo 13 L engine. Two main models to predict the oil flow in main {{and connecting}} <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> have been investigated using the system analysis software GT-SUITE. These two models are based on two numerical methods called  the Mobility method and the Reynold's equation respectively. The main bearing and the connecting <b>rod</b> large <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> loads calculated in the present work is similar to the reference bearing loads, especially for connecting <b>rod</b> large <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> and at lower engine speeds. For higher engine speeds, the present load results are far off,  compared to the reference load results. This difference at the higher engine speeds showed also an increased difference in the oil volume flow rates. But more information regarding the calculations of the reference loads is needed to analyze the differences further. Considering the "split lines", where the upper and the lower bearing shell meet, in the bearing models increased the oil volume flow rate with 13. 3 % on average for the main bearing. Main bearing stand for 86 % of the total flow whilst connecting <b>rod</b> large <b>end</b> and small end bearing stand for the rest 13 % and 1 % of the total flow. The feed of oil to main <b>bearing</b> and connecting <b>rod</b> large <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> appears continuously whilst the feed of oil to connecting <b>rod</b> small <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> appears {{in the form of a}} few pulsations. Comparing to the numerical reference flow results, the results in this work are similar at high oil temperatures and at low engine speeds, otherwise the results are far off. Considering the Reynold's equation when predicting the oil volume flow rates in plain journal bearings is a more accurate way than using the Mobility method since it takes more specific geometrical irregularities into account. The oil volume flow rate for main bearing differ with 2. 7 % on average when solving the Reynold's equation compared to the Mobility method...|$|R

40|$|The tie <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{elementary}} parts of a steering mechanism, which has direct and crucial importance in terms of driving safety. The main function of this part is to transfer the routing, coming from the steering linkage, to steering knuckle via tie rot arm. In this study the structural analysis of a tie <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> part for a van-type vehicle is carried out by finite element (FE) modeling of the body, the joint and the bearing. Hence, unlike the previous studies in literature, each component of the tie <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> is included in FE model and a complete assembly is analyzed by means of contact interactions between parts. The analyses for the joint assembly are carried out for different possible tie-end orientations, and by this modeling approach, the stress variations and deformation characteristics of each component are investigated for different operational loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} demonstrated that an axially loaded weightless circular rod buckles helically when constrained within a circular cylinder. The effects of pinned and fixed end conditions {{on the behavior of}} such a helically buckled rod are investigated. Both end conditions locate the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> on the cylinder axis. The pinned end condition considers the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> free to rotate about all three axes, allows axial translation, and prevents radial movement. The fixed end condition allows axial rotation and translation, requires the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> to be tangent to the cylinder axis, and prevents radial movement. Both end conditions are found to perturb the helix in an exponentially decaying manner for a distance of less than one pitch length. Far from the <b>end,</b> the <b>rod</b> behaves as an undisturbed constant-pitch helix. The distance from the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> to the point of initial contact with the cylinder wall is calculated. Closed form analytical solutions are obtained for the deflected shapes and internal reactions of the end sections. The maximum internal bending moment for the pinned-end case is 19. 5 % higher in the end section than in the helical section. The maximum bending moment for the fixed-end case also occurs in the end section and is 1 % higher than in the helical section. The solution procedure applies to rods of either finite or infinite length. Experimental results confirm the analytical findings...|$|R
50|$|A {{mechanism}} {{in which a}} body moves through a general spatial movement is called a spatial mechanism. An example is the RSSR linkage, which {{can be viewed as}} a four-bar linkage in which the hinged joints of the coupler link are replaced by <b>rod</b> <b>ends,</b> also called spherical joints or ball joints. The <b>rod</b> <b>ends</b> allow the input and output cranks of the RSSR linkage to be misaligned to the point that they lie in different planes, which causes the coupler link to move in a general spatial movement. Robot arms, Stewart platforms, and humanoid robotic systems are also examples of spatial mechanisms.|$|R

40|$|The {{method of}} two-sided {{evaluations}} is {{extended to the}} problems of stability of an elastic non-uniformly compressed rod, the variation formulations of which may be presented in terms of internal bending moments with uniform integral conditions. The problems are considered, in which one <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> is fixed and the other <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> is either restraint or pivoted, or embedded into a support which may be shifted in a transversal direction. For the substantiation of the lower evaluations determination, a sequence of functionals is constructed, the minimum values of which are the lower evaluations for the minimum critical value of the loading parameter of the rod, and the calculation process is reduced to the determination of the maximum eigenvalues of modular matrices. The matrix elements are expressed in terms of integrals of basic functions {{depending on the type of}} fixation of the <b>rod</b> <b>ends.</b> The basic functions, with the accuracy up to a linear polynomial, are the same as the bending moments arising with the bifurcation of the equilibrium of a rod with a constant cross-section compressed by longitudinal forces at the <b>rod</b> <b>ends.</b> The calculation of the upper evaluation is reduced to the determination of the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix, which almost coincides with one of the elements of the modular matrices. It is noted that the obtained upper bound evaluation is not worse thanthe evaluation obtained by the Ritz method with the use of the same basic functions...|$|R

Polyurethane materials, which show excellent properties as abrasion resistance, flexibility and needle pressure stability, can be used as dust boots in tie <b>rod</b> <b>ends.</b> So in this study flexibility, abrasion resistance and needle pressure stability are investigated by changing the hardness of polyurethane materials. In the experiment materials, named as Elastollan-C 60 A and Elastollan-C 70 A, are used as dust boots. During physical tests to be applied to the dust boot are as followed; hardness, tensile strength, elongation at break, recovery, compression set at 70 0 C/ 24 h, density, volume, weight, adhesive resistance, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter. During the aging tests, following steps are applied; change of hardness, change of tensile strength, volume change, change of weight, change of friction, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter at 100 0 C/ 70 h in the lithium grease and circulating air test. Finally those polyurethane materials, used as dust boots, are applied according to the criteria of ASTM, and DIN in order to preserve tie <b>rod</b> <b>ends</b> from outer factors for a long time.

40|$|Surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) is {{a highly}} sensitive probe for molecular detection. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an efficient platform for investigating the kinetics of catalytic reactions with SERS. To achieve this, we synthesized a novel Au-Pd bimetallic nanostructure (HIF-AuNR@AuPd) through site-specific epitaxial growth of Au-Pd alloy horns as catalytic sites at the ends of Au nanorods. Using high-resolution electron microscopy and tomography, we successfully reconstructed the complex three-dimensional morphology of HIF-AuNR@AuPd and identified that the horns are bound with high-index { 11 l} (0. 25 < l < 0. 43) facets. With an electron beam probe, we visualized the distribution of surface plasmon over the HIF-AuNR@AuPd nanorods, finding that strong longitudinal surface plasmon resonance concentrated at the <b>rod</b> <b>ends.</b> This unique crystal morphology led to the coupling of high catalytic activity with a strong SERS effect at the <b>rod</b> <b>ends,</b> making HIF-AuNR@AuPd an excellent bifunctional platform for in situ monitoring of surface catalytic reactions. Using the hydrogenation of 4 -nitrothiophenol as a model reaction, we demonstrated that its first-order reaction kinetics could be accurately determined from this platform. Moreover, we clearly identified the superior catalytic activity of the <b>rod</b> <b>ends</b> relative to that of the rod bodies, owing to the different SERS activities at the two positions. In comparison with other reported Au-Pd bimetallic nanostructures, HIF-AuNR@AuPd offered both higher catalytic activity and greater detection sensitivity. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
