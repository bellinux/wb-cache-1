Before these could be delivered, however, war broke out, and the aircraft were impressed into the French Army. To these, the Army soon added an order of 94 aircraft, and the British Royal Flying Corps also acquired a number, these latter machines purchased from Grahame-White, who was manufacturing the type in the UK under licence. At the outbreak of war, the type's military value was found to <b>be</b> <b>wanting,</b> and the French machines were quickly relegated to training duties.|$|E
25|$|June 15, 2005 - Paul Martin's {{minority}} government survives {{no fewer}} than 16 confidence votes in the House of Commons. A defeat on any {{of them would have}} forced an election. But in the end, there was no repeat of the single-vote squeaker win of May 19. The closest vote passed 153 to 149; Gurmant Grewal is on stress leave over the tape scandal, two other conservative MPs are sick with cancer, and Thibault from the BQ is away due to the passing away of her father. As well, a series of public opinion polls released just days earlier all showed the Liberals in the lead, one of them released just a week ago showing the Liberals have a 14% lead over the Tories. The Tories seem themselves to not <b>be</b> <b>wanting</b> an election now, either.|$|E

2500|$|Later in 1729, Curll set out {{to publish}} a volume of William Congreve. [...] John Arbuthnot complained in the press of Curll's action, so Curll renamed his shop [...] "Congreve's Head" [...] and put up a bust of Congreve to spite Arbuthnot and Congreve's friends. [...] In 1731 he moved shops to Burleigh Street and advertised an {{upcoming}} life of Pope, saying, [...] "Nothing shall <b>be</b> <b>wanting</b> but his (universally desired) Death." [...] In response to his call for materials, a person known as [...] "P.T." [...] offered Curll some Pope letters. [...] The letters, however, were fakes, and the entire offer had been a set-up by Pope, who published a corrected version of his letters in 1735. [...] Curll moved his shop again in that year and called it [...] "Pope's Head" [...] and sold under the sign of Pope. [...] Two years later, he published five volumes of Pope's letters. [...] In 1741, Pope finally prevailed against Curll in the courts. [...] A court ruled that letters affix copyright to the author, although a recipient of a letter has no copyright status.|$|E

[...] César-Auguste's technical abilities as a pianist were acknowledged; his abilities as a composer were (probably justly at this point) felt to <b>be</b> <b>wanting.</b> [...] The whole situation was aggravated by what in the end became a feud between Nicolas-Joseph and Henri Blanchard, the principal critic of the Revue et Gazette musicale, who lost no opportunity to castigate the aggressive pretensions {{of the father and}} to mock the [...] "imperial" [...] names of the elder son. [...] This animosity, [...] "undoubtedly personal", may well have caused Nicolas-Joseph to decide that a return to Belgium was in order, and [...] in 1842 [...] "a peremptory order" [...] to young Franck compelled the latter to leave the Conservatoire and accompany him.|$|E
