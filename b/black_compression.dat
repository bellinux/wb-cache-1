After winning the title by several points over rivals Towson and Dulaney, another team's coaches notified officials that one Hereford runner had violated a national high school running rule by wearing <b>black</b> <b>compression</b> shorts with white stitching on each side. The Hereford team member, who had finished fourth overall, was disqualified, costing the team the championship. There was much debate over the fairness of this ruling, since minor violations to the national rules occur frequently, many of which were at the very same race. The disqualified runner, a Hereford senior, was featured in an interview article by the New York Times.|$|E
40|$|Calamitalean stems {{that are}} {{preserved}} in growth position in Carboniferous sedimentary deposits {{have been described}} {{many times in the}} literature as either pith casts or stem casts. Many of these in situ stems show branching, which gives some information on their patterns of growth. Their manner of preservation is discussed in the light of a new stand of well-preserved in situ stem and branch pith casts of Calamites discovered in mid to upper Duckmantian sandstone at Brymbo in the Wrexham Coalfield of North Wales. Analysis of a brown mineralized layer surrounding the casts and below the <b>black</b> <b>compression</b> remains of the stem tissues has shown the presence of goethite, muscovite, quartz and kaolin. Deposition of these minerals around the inside of the central stem cavity would have provided rigidity and sufficient support, while the pith cavity filled with sediments. The outer tissues would then have been compressed to form a thin coal layer around the mineralized infill of the pith cavity. Cross sections of stems were found clustered together in relatively small areas, and kernel density map and nearest neighbour analysis suggest that each small patch of these pith casts represents an individual plant spread by rhizomatous growth. Stems found in ironstone nodules are external casts of leafy stems preserved by the deposition of siderite on their surfaces.

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{objective}} measures to evaluate compression methods for machine recognition applications. Vidware Vision, a <b>black</b> box <b>compression</b> method developed by Vidware Incorporated, {{is used in}} the case and its performance is compared to existing compression methods, i. e., JPEG and JPEG 2000, based on various measures. The encoding and decoding time are used to characterize computational complexity. Full- and no-reference image quality measures are exploited to describe distortions and degradations in the decompressed images. In addition, since this paper focuses on the performance of compression methods relating to machine recognition applications, we propose a non-separable rational function based Tenengrad (NSRT 2) measure to evaluate the sharpness of decompressed images. Based on our experimental results, Vidware VisionTM is robust to changes in compression ratio and presents gradually degraded performance at a considerably slower speed in terms of computational complexity and image quality. Particularly, according to full-reference measures Vidware Vision outperforms JPEG and JPEG 2000 when the compression ratio is larger than 140. The effectiveness of our proposed NSRT 2, as a new comparison tool, is also validated via experiments and performance comparisons with other tested measures...|$|R

40|$|Two-dimensional {{materials}} tend {{to become}} crumpled according to the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and the resulting ripple deformation may significantly influence electronic properties as observed in graphene and MoS 2. Here we unveil by first-principles calculations a new, highly anisotropic ripple pattern in phosphorene, a monolayer <b>black</b> phosphorus, where <b>compression</b> induced ripple deformation occurs only along the zigzag direction in the strain range up to 10 %, but not the armchair direction. This direction-selective ripple deformation mode in phosphorene stems from its puckered structure with coupled hinge-like bonding configurations and the resulting anisotropic Poisson ratio. We also construct an analytical model using classical elasticity theory for ripple deformation in phosphorene under arbitrary strain. The present results offer {{new insights into the}} mechanisms governing the structural and electronic properties of phosphorene crucial to its device applications. Comment: J. Phys. Chem.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Effect {{of various}} {{efficient}} vulcanization (EV) sulfur cure systems on the compression set of a nitrile rubber filled with car-bon black and silica/silane fillers was examined. The cure systems had different amounts of thiuram and sulfenamide accelerators and elemental sulfur, whilst the loading of zinc oxide and stearic acid activators was kept constant. The fillers had surface areas from 35 to 175 m 2 /g. In this study, the lowest compression set was measured for the rubber filled with carbon black with 78 m 2 /g surface area, which was cured with an EV cure system {{made of a}} small amount of elemental sulfur and large amounts of the two accelerators. Interestingly, a small change in the amount of elemental sulfur had a bigger effect on the compression set than did large changes in the loading of the accelerators in the cure system.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} the stratigraphic and structural {{development of the}} Eastern Pontides, North Turkey, based on section logging at eight localities, construction of three structural profiles across the mountains, and published literature. The Eastern Pontides comprise a Late Carboniferous to Miocene sequence resting on a basement of Hercynian metamorphics. Late Carboniferous to Scythian sediments are continental clastics interpreted as having been deposited in an extensional half graben. The Middle Triassic is limestone, reflecting {{the development of a}} south facing passive margin. In the Late Triassic, the ocean (Palaeotethys) began to close: flysch was deposited in most places with minor shallow water limestones in the Sinemurian above an inverted half graben. All pre-Aalenian strata were deformed during the Cimmerian orogeny. After a phase of subduction-related volcanism in the Mid-Jurassic, limestones were deposited during the Late Jurassic and early Cretaceous, mainly in shallow water. The Aptian and Albian are absent due to doming in the Western Pontides prior to the opening of the Western Black Sea, but there is a thick sequence of Upper Cretaceous arc volcanic rocks and intervening turbidites. The Upper Palaeocene is absent, possibly due to rifting in the Eastern <b>Black</b> Sea. Major <b>compression</b> affected the Pontides from the Eocene to the Pliocene associated with the closure of the Tethyan Ocean. Oligocene and younger rocks are accordingly non-marine...|$|R
