40|$|<b>Bark</b> <b>stripping</b> by {{red deer}} (Cervus elaphus) causes {{considerable}} damage to Austrian forests, however, {{the incidence of}} <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> was never examined from large scale survey data. In this manuscript we present a logistic regression model for <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> damage (static model) and a model for recent (5 -year period) <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> damage to previously undamaged trees (dynamic model) developed from Austrian National Forest Inventory data. Both models showed <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> damage to be most frequent in core red deer habitat areas and less frequent in less suitable habitat. Damage was concentrated at elevations of 400 – 1200 m and in alluvial forests (only static model). Norway spruce (Picea abies), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and Sorbus spp. had 11 – 12 times more injuries {{than all the other}} species. Red deer preferred the smallest trees with a breast height diameter of 5 cm for <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> and damage probability decreased rapidly for trees with a breast height diameter greater than 25 cm. Our static model showed a maximum of <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> damage in stands with a mean height of 20 m.

40|$|<b>Bark</b> <b>stripping</b> {{by large}} herbivores is widespread, yet poorly understood. Our study {{was carried out}} in a 2000 -ha area {{situated}} in the Vosges Mountains, France, where beech Fagus sylvatica bark is heavily <b>bark</b> <b>stripped</b> by red deer Cervus elaphus. We tested whether the seasonal variation in the frequency of beech <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> by red deer was correlated with bark nutritive value or bark mechanical properties (using an index of bark detachability). We also evaluated whether red deer selected beech trees based on the chemical composition of their bark (e. g. carbohydrates and minerals). Bark-stripped trees had slightly higher carbohydrate contents than non-stripped trees, but this difference resulted from a physiological reaction of the tree to <b>bark</b> <b>stripping.</b> <b>Bark</b> composition was similar between stripped and non-stripped trees spring and summer, but was easier to detach during these periods than during autumn and winter. Therefore, beech <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> by red deer in the Vosges Mountains {{does not appear to be}} driven by nutritional needs, but it may help deer in improving digestion efficiency...|$|R

This study aimed at {{assessing}} the incidence and intensity of <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> by red deer in the fenced rearing centre “Lomnička Reka“ (Mt. Veliki Jastrebac, central Serbia). The data were collected by detailed surveying of the entire rearing centre over spring and autumn 2008, 2009 and 2010. Our results show that, in spring and summer, it is exclusively broadleaf tree species that are <b>bark</b> <b>stripped</b> by red deer, mainly beech (86. 3 % or 536 trees) and hornbeam (10. 1 % or 63 trees).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the susceptibility, intensity and distribution of pine trees to <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> by chacma baboons Papio ursinus in three plantations in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe. The number of plots/ha, stripped trees/plot and stripped trees/ha was recorded during the pre-rainy, rainy and post-rainy seasons from August 2006 to May 2007. During data collection, altitude, aspect, season and other site predictor variables (e. g., roads and fire traces, water points, indigenous vegetation conservation areas, crop fields, human settlements, wattle scrubs, rocky areas, open grasslands, earlier stripped sites and roost sites) were recorded for each plot in association with selected predictor variables within plantation estates. Data on the number of stripped plots/ha, stripped trees/plot and stripped trees/ha were analysed as dependent variables using the Generalised Linear Model (GLM) through SPSS version 15 (2006) to determine which predictor variables were significantly related to <b>bark</b> <b>stripping.</b> Differences between means were tested using Bonferroni tests with a 5 % level of significance. Our findings show that <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> of pine trees by baboons occurred at all altitudes and aspects. Overall, the number of <b>bark</b> <b>stripped</b> trees/ha did not significantly vary by season. The number of <b>bark</b> <b>stripped</b> plots/ha was lower during the pre-rainy season than the rainy season, whereas the number of <b>bark</b> <b>stripped</b> trees/plot was higher during the pre-rainy than the rainy season. <b>Bark</b> <b>stripping</b> of pines occurred more often in the vicinities of areas with abundant food and water [Current Zoology 55 (6) : 389 – 395, 2009]...|$|R
40|$|This study reports daily {{activity}} pattern, {{home range}} size, daily travel distances and feeding behaviour for {{a troop of}} chacma baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus) inhabiting a pine plantation in Eastern Highlands, Zimbabwe. The {{amount of time spent}} foraging is similar to other baboons, Papio hamadryas in particular. The minimum home range size and daily travel distance for this troop are smaller than those reported for other troops of chacma, yellow, olive and hamadryas baboons in South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Saudi Arabia.

40|$|Sclerocarya birrea ssp. caffra (marula), {{a typical}} savanna tree, is {{vulnerable}} {{to the effects of}} fire, herbivory and their combination. This paper investigated the relative importance of these agents of disturbance, {{at the level of the}} individual stem, by specifically focusing on the following questions: (i) What is the greatest cause of mortality in adult marula stems in conservation areas with both elephants and fire? (ii) Does fire interact with <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> to cause adult stem mortality and if so what is the dominant mechanism? (iii) At what stem diameter are marulas resistant to fire? Field surveys quantified the extent of damage in marula individuals in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, highlighting the high levels of extreme herbivory such as toppling (7 %) and pollarding (8 %), relative to <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> (only 6 % with more than 50 % of the circumference stripped). In addition to extreme herbivory, the progression from <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> through to invasion of the soft, exposed heartwood by wood borers, often facilitated by fire, through to toppling of the weakened stem after successive fires, appears to be the dominant mechanism by which fire interacts with herbivory to cause adult stem death. <b>Bark</b> <b>stripping</b> and fire manipulation experiments indicated that <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> failed to increase the vulnerability of stems to fire directly through transport tissue damage. However, the combination of <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> and fire reduced the ability of the stem to regrow bark, increasing the vulnerability of the exposed stem to boring insects and future fires. Fire manipulation experiments were used to identify the minimum stem diameter of resistance to fire. Marula resisted stem death when greater than 3. 4 cm in basal diameter. This paper emphasizes the importance of both fire and herbivory in the development of woody plant population structure and by extension, the relative proportion of trees and grasses in savanna landscape...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGrey squirrels, Sciurus carolinensis, damage {{trees in}} the UK by <b>stripping</b> <b>bark</b> and eating the {{underlying}} phloem; squirrel motivation for damage is, however, unknown. Damage can result in deterioration of timber quality and a significant economic toll on the forestry industry. Prediction of severe damage followed by targeted killing of squirrels is the current recommended management option. However, the use of warfarin (an anticoagulant poison) is now restricted in the UK and other more humane methods of killing are labour-intensive, so an alternative solution is needed. A better understanding of what motivates grey squirrels to <b>strip</b> <b>bark</b> may enable a preventive approach to be developed. Whilst the <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> literature has explored predictive factors affecting the likelihood of damage, causal understanding is lacking. The aim of this review is to introduce the Calcium Hypothesis as a possible explanation for <b>bark</b> <b>stripping,</b> {{with a view to}} informing the prevention of damage. The Calcium Hypothesis states that grey squirrels damage trees to ameliorate a calcium deficiency. The main predictive factors of <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> behaviour each inform and lend support to the Calcium Hypothesis. Calcium is stored in tree phloem, and damage increases with phloem width, providing squirrels with more calcium per unit area ingested. Calcium levels increase in trees as active growth resumes after winter dormancy, this occurs immediately prior to the main <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> season of May–July, and trees growing most vigorously are at increased risk of damage. It is likely grey squirrels also have a requirement for calcium during the <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> season. Adult females will be under post-parturition pressures such as lactation, and juveniles will be going through their main period of bone growth, both of which likely represent a requirement for calcium – which supports an observed positive correlation between juvenile abundance and <b>bark</b> <b>stripping.</b> A high autumnal seed crop increases juvenile recruitment the following spring, and could also induce a requirement for calcium to a population due to the high phosphorus to calcium ratio of seeds. To further investigate the hypothesis, the extent to which grey squirrels can utilise calcium oxalate, as calcium occurs in bark, should be determined, and also the extent to which grey squirrels undergo seasonal periods of calcium deficiency. Increasing our causal understanding of <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> could inform the future development of preventive measures to aid forest management...|$|R

Logs (52 <b>bark</b> <b>stripped,</b> 28 controls) came from eight sites that had tree crops 28 – 39 years old; the logs were stratified for wound size (180 cm 2), large wounds being rare. Many wounded logs had no stain or rot, but six of the 33 better-quality sawlogs were judged to be usable only for pulp. Modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture were affected only at wounds and only in the sapwood there; at this position, mean stiffness and strength were both significantly reduced compared with control logs, with lowest means for logs with large wounds. Large wounds suffered a much greater incidence of stain and rot than small wounds, but their rarity meant that the calculated financial loss caused by the <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> estimated to be incurred over the whole rotation up to felling was only 3 per cent of the crop value. ...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{elephant}} {{populations have}} {{been implicated in}} the decline of woody vegetation throughout Africa. The problem is particularly relevant to the Kruger National Park in South Africa, where elephant populations have almost {{doubled in the last}} 10 years. One manner in which elephants utilize trees is by <b>stripping</b> their <b>bark.</b> The role of <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> in increasing stem vulnerability to fire and the mechanism through which fire damage is mediated were investigated by experimentally removing bark and burning Acacia nigrescens stems. Field surveys were conducted in order to investigate patterns of <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> in relation to mortality patterns of large trees occurring subsequent to natural fires. In the experimental study, an increasing probability of mortality was associated with increasing amount of bark removed when trees were burnt. However, when trees were stripped but not burnt, simulating damage to cambium and phloem, none died in the 4 -month period over which the experiment ran. This was taken as evidence that fire-induced xylem damage causes stem mortality. However, fire did kill a greater proportion of the remaining stem cambium around the circumference when bark had been removed. The field surveys indicate that <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> by elephants is frequent on large stems (44 %) and that larger trees are more heavily impacted. The only variable measured that explained mortality patterns well was the percent of bark removed around the stem circumference up to 3 m (p = 0. 0076). These results indicate that damage to xylem is important in determining post-fire survival and that <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> by elephants increases the vulnerability of stems to fire. This increased vulnerability is a result of both increased damage to cambium and damage to exposed xylem. The high proportion of trees stripped by elephants and the increase in vulnerability to mortality associated with <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> suggests that unless elephant population growth is curbed, large Acacia nigrescens trees will eventually be eliminated from this ecosystem...|$|R

Cedar trees are also vital to this population of Barbary macaques as an area with cedars can support a much higher density of macaques than one without them.

5000|$|Certain {{behavior}} of the grey squirrel, such as <b>bark</b> <b>stripping,</b> also has negative effects on trees and timber plantations. This {{is thought to be}} biggest effect introduced squirrels have on island ecosystems. For example, Garry oak trees on Vancouver Island have become endangered due to urban development and the presence of invasive species including the grey squirrel. Scatter-hoarding of seeds by grey squirrels causes notching in the acorns of white oaks. Notching prevents germination, which can hinder natural forest regeneration. [...] <b>Bark</b> <b>stripping</b> makes branches weaker and more susceptible to being broken off by wind or animals and can also cause secondary infection that may lead to death. <b>Bark</b> <b>stripping</b> makes trees more susceptible to Red Band Needle Blight (RBNB), which is caused by the asexual stage of the fungus Dothistroma septosporum. RBNB results in a necrotrophic infection that kills needle tissue in pine species. Phytophthora ramorum is another fungus affecting tree health. Trees between 10 and 40 years of age and certain species, including beech and sycamore, are more vulnerable than others. Grey squirrels also damage trees by eating their sap, suggesting this behavior provides some nutritional benefit.|$|R
40|$|African {{elephants}} (Loxodonta africana) are ecosystem {{engineers in}} that they substantially alter the environment through their unique foraging and feeding habits. At high densities, elephants potentially have negative impacts on the environment, specifically to large trees. Because of this, recent increases of elephants in the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR) on the Western Boundary of Kruger National Park, South Africa have caused concern regarding the health of several species of tree. My objective {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of wrapping protective wire netting around the trunk of the tree in preventing and reducing <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> by elephants. 2, 668 trees, 1352 marula (Sclerocarya birrea), 857 knobthorn (Acacia Nigrescens), and 459 false marula (Lannea schweinfurti), were assessed for elephant impact in the APNR, 1387 (52 %) of which had previously been wrapped in protective wire netting (789, 548, and 50 respectively). For knobthorn and marula, wire netting significantly decreased the number of the trees that were <b>bark</b> <b>stripped.</b> For all trees, wire netting decreased the level of <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> especially for the highest impact levels. No trees wrapped with wire were ringbarked, compared to 23 unwired trees. In addition, wire netting had an effect on the distribution of damage for the highest impact class incurred regardless of type. A higher relative frequency of wired trees were found in lower impact categories compared to unwired trees. Wire netting is a low maintenance and ecologically valuable technique that alleviates <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> for some species.

The probability of <b>bark</b> <b>stripping</b> depends on distance from the forest edge, density, age and tree species diversity of stands, slope and aspect of terrain, and red deer density; contrary to expectations, it is not related to distance from feeding places.
