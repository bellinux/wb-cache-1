5000|$|... 6111 {{aluminium}} and 2008 {{aluminium alloy}} are extensively used for external automotive body panels, with 5083 and 5754 used for inner <b>body</b> panels. <b>Bonnets</b> have been manufactured from 2036, 6016, and 6111 alloys. Truck and trailer body panels have used 5456 aluminium.|$|R
50|$|The {{main parts}} of the most usual type of valve are the <b>body</b> and the <b>bonnet.</b> These two parts form the casing that holds the fluid going through the valve.|$|R
5000|$|The vehicle {{shown on}} the picture {{appears to be the}} same vehicle that {{appeared}} in a Spanish Firestone calendar for 1977, (incorrectly being labelled [...] "Dalgleish"), being featured on the Abril, Mayo, Junio (April, May, June) page. In that picture, the vehicle had a white on black number plate commencing [...] "S123 ...". It had a simpler radiator cap and had red panel decorative lining to the <b>body</b> and <b>bonnet.</b> The seat was simpler with a single circular arc on the sides and had no seat hood.|$|R
50|$|The angular {{hatchback}} {{was designed}} by Marcello Gandini of Bertone, based on his unused design for the British 1977 Reliant FW11 concept and his 1979 Volvo Tundra concept car. It was the second car {{to benefit from the}} merger of Peugeot and Citroën in 1976, the first being the Citroën Visa launched in 1978. The BX shared its platform with the more conventional 405 that appeared in 1987, except the rear suspension which is from a Peugeot 305 Break. Among the features that set the car apart from the competition was the traditional Citroën hydropneumatic self-levelling suspension, extensive use of plastic <b>body</b> panels (<b>bonnet,</b> tailgate, bumpers), and front and rear disc brakes.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the seating}} layout was {{established}} the exterior was designed around it, hence designing inside out. The form is largely symmetrical and asymmetry is introduced {{in such a}} way that it does not hamper aerodynamic efficiency. The features include asymmetric <b>body</b> panels and <b>bonnet,</b> which creates interesting, highlights and provides space for boot and a spare wheel. The non - driver side has an asymmetrical gull-wing door, which provides easier ingress and egress for occupants.|$|R
5000|$|Falcon XR8 Xplod sedan: {{unveiled}} in 2001 but never produced, {{it was a}} concept car painted in a distinctive [...] "Firestorm" [...] gold paint and powered by a 200 kW, 5.0-Litre V8 engine benefitting from a custom Remus exhaust system and Pacemaker extractors; it also featured a full Tickford <b>body</b> kit with <b>bonnet</b> air scoops and Premium brake system, 18-inch MOMO alloy wheels, a black/gold Recaro leather-trimmed interior driving seats and, importantly, a Sony [...] "Xplod" [...] audio and DVD system from which it derived its name; ...|$|R
5000|$|Although the R33/36 World's Fair {{cars were}} later {{referred}} to as Redbirds, the cars were originally painted in a light turquoise blue and white upon delivery. This [...] "Bluebird" [...] paint color scheme was used until the mid-1970s when they were painted in the silver/blue MTA livery. Then they were painted a full white (roof, bonnets, sides were all painted white) from 1981 to 1982 to combat graffiti; since the white paint was a Teflon-based paint, the graffiti did not stick to it very well. The look was abandoned for the famous Redbird style. The Redbirds were painted between 1984 and 1989 to a deep maroon red <b>body,</b> black front <b>bonnets</b> and anti-climbers, and a silver roof.|$|R
50|$|Production of the 3500 GT {{started in}} late 1957; {{eighteen}} cars were built that year, the first handful leaving the factory before Christmas. All 3500 GTs had leather interior and Jaeger instruments.A first Touring convertible prototype was {{shown at the}} 1958 Turin Motor Show.But it was a proposal by Carrozzeria Vignale (designed by Michelotti) shown at the 1959 Salon de l'Auto in Paris that went into production as 3500 GT Convertibile. The Convertibile did not feature Touring's Superleggera construction, but rather a steel <b>body</b> with aluminium <b>bonnet,</b> boot lid and optional hard top; it was also built on an 10 cm shorter wheelbase, and weighed 1380 kg. Front disc brakes and limited slip differential became optional in 1959, and were standardized in 1960; rear discs became standard in 1962.|$|R
50|$|Defiance, a fast {{touring car}} on the 40 hp chassis was {{exhibited}} at Olympia's 1912 Motor Show. It is delivered ready for the road with hood, screen, Austin-Sankey detachable wheels, dynamo and lamps. The CAV dynamo projects through the aluminium dashboard from its mounting on an aluminium bridge over the flywheel. It is driven by a counter shaft taking its drive from the camshaft. The Automotor Journal described Defiance as having a Torpedo body.Defiance had been developed from the 40 hp for the 2,000 mile trial held by the Automobile Club of Russia and run from St Petersburg to Riga and Moscow. It was given a streamlined <b>body,</b> a tapered <b>bonnet</b> and a radiator with rounded edges. It performed well. At St Petersburg over the flying kilometre carrying three people, two spare wheels, spare parts and luggage it was timed at 28 seconds, more than 80 miles an hour.|$|R
40|$|Data {{obtained}} in teenage cyclist impact against three vehicles (sedan, SUV and Pick Up), tested in previous works, are analyzed {{to verify the}} theoretical results by the coupling of momentum conservation principle and energy conservation principle. The speed of vehicle and thorax are compared with theoretical ones, obtaining an excellent agreement. Following the results found in the literature, particular emphasis is done on teenager cyclist thorax and head speeds, indicating that the cyclist speed can be theoretically until 1, 41 times the impact speed, while greater values, until 2, are {{obtained in}} the simulations. A small slowing of the vehicle is found theoretically and in the simulations, due to kinetic energy transfer. A small component of the vehicle speed exists in the orthogonal plane to the motion, due, for example, to the compression of the rider <b>body</b> on the <b>bonnet.</b> A parameter is determined using all the data in term of thorax speed, in all the impact speeds and in all the relative positions; its value does not appear depending on the vehicle mass. It allows the subsequent determination of the best values of three geometric actual parameters identified {{in front of the}} vehicle: bumper height, bonnet height and bonnet inclination angle, by interpolation with a second order curve, by making the conclusion that the frontal part of the vehicle may be designed {{in order to reduce the}} injur...|$|R
50|$|The Scottish Bus Group had mainly dual-sourced {{the bodies}} on their Leyland Titan PD2 and PD3 from Northern Counties Motor and Engineering Company of Wigan and Walter Alexander Coachbuilders of Falkirk {{and it was}} these two who would provide the bodies for SBG's Lowlanders. Western and Central took both firm's {{products}} whilst the Alexander companies took Alexander bodywork (the bus operations of Walter Alexander & Sons had been separated from the vehicle building activities prior to the nationalisation of the SMT group's bus operations to avoid the sales restrictions that afflicted Bristol Commercial Vehicles and Eastern Coach Works from 1948). Alexander also bodied the Southend batch, East Midland’s first twelve and both batches for Ribble: these were notable as the only Lowlanders to have fully fronted <b>bodies,</b> the GRP <b>bonnet</b> assembly built into the body and disguised at the front with a similar grille (with a Ribble legend rather than the badges of Leyland or Albion) to the fully fronted Titans Ribble had taken from 1958 to 1963. Access to the engine cover for maintenance was provided by a hinged door of the same shape as the driver's door, but with an additional kerb-viewing window. Only Ribble took Alexander bodies with hinged driver's doors, SBG, East Midland and Southend Corporation used inward-sliding driver's doors, as also used by Northern Counties and Metro Cammell Weymann.|$|R
