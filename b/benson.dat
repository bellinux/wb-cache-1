5|$|Later, Judge Donnelly {{is nearly}} killed when {{she sits on}} a needle filled with {{potassium}} chloride at her home; she is saved when Stabler and <b>Benson</b> rush her to the hospital. O'Halloran tells Stabler and <b>Benson</b> that a mosquito sucked the blood from the killer {{as he or she}} was rigging Zimmer's car, and that the DNA from the blood will likely implicate Harrison. As the DNA is later being processed, however, O'Halloran is stabbed and killed by someone in the forensics lab. Stabler arrives and sees on the computer screen that the DNA matches Stuckey just before Stuckey knocks him out from behind. Stuckey then answers Elliot's phone when <b>Benson</b> calls to say that Stabler went out for lunch and forgot his phone. He then ties Stabler to a chair and starts torturing him. Stuckey admits he killed the woman at Coney Island in order to frame Harrison, and that he attacked Zimmer and Donnelly for embarrassing him. <b>Benson</b> arrives and is held at gunpoint by Stuckey, but she convinces Stuckey that she, too, hates Stabler and is in love with Stuckey. While <b>Benson</b> kisses Stuckey to distract him, Stabler kicks him from behind, allowing <b>Benson</b> to knock Stuckey out and free Stabler. When Stabler asks how <b>Benson</b> knew he was in trouble, <b>Benson</b> says that Stuckey told her he went out for sushi, which she knows that Stabler hates.|$|E
