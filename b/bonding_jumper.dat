50|$|A similar <b>bonding</b> <b>jumper</b> wire {{can also}} be seen {{crossing}} gas meters, but for a different reason.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bonding</b> <b>jumper,</b> main: The {{connection}} between the grounded circuit conductor (neutral) and the equipment-grounding conductor at the service.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes the {{fittings}} {{are considered}} sufficiently conductive to bond (electrically unite) the metal conduit to a metal junction box (thus sharing the box's ground connection); other times, grounding bushings are used which have <b>bonding</b> <b>jumpers</b> from the bushing to a grounding screw on the box.|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the good}} {{electrical}} conductivity and high stability {{in the face of}} short-circuit pulses, exothermic welds are one of the options specified by ยง250.7 of the United States National Electrical Code for grounding conductors and <b>bonding</b> <b>jumpers.</b> [...] It is the preferred method of bonding, and indeed it is the only acceptable means of bonding copper to galvanized cable. [...] The NEC does not require such exothermically welded connections to be listed or labelled, but some engineering specifications require that completed exothermic welds be examined using X-ray equipment.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bonding</b> <b>jumper</b> is a {{reliable}} conductor {{to ensure the}} required electrical conductivity between metal raceways required to be electrically connected.|$|E
50|$|Correcting {{the problem}} is a simple matter of either {{purchasing}} a copper <b>bonding</b> <b>jumper</b> kit, composed of copper cable at least #6 AWG in diameter and two bronze ground clamps for affixing it the plumbing. See NFPA 70, the U.S. National Electrical Code Handbook (NEC), section on bonding and ground for details on selecting the correct bonding conductor wire size.|$|E
50|$|Pinhole leaks with pitting {{initiating}} on {{the exterior}} surface of the pipe, can occur if copper piping is improperly grounded or bonded. The phenomenon is known technically as stray current corrosion or electrolytic pitting. Pin-holing due to poor grounding or poor bonding occurs typically in homes where the original plumbing has been modified; homeowners may find that a new plastic water filtration device or plastic repair union has interrupted the water pipe's electrical continuity to ground, when they start seeing pinhole water leaks after a recent install. Damage occurs rapidly, usually becoming obvious about {{six months after the}} ground interruption. Correctly installed plumbing appliances will have a copper <b>bonding</b> <b>jumper</b> cable connecting the interrupted pipe sections. Pinhole leaks from stray current corrosion can result in thousands of dollars in plumbing bills, and sometimes require the replacement of the entire affected water line. The cause is fundamentally an electrical defect, not a plumbing defect; once the plumbing damage is repaired, an electrician should promptly be consulted to evaluate the grounding and bonding of the entire plumbing and electrical systems.|$|E
