5|$|I {{was anxious}} that such details {{should be put}} on record <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these {{regional}} cooking pots are already becoming {{very hard to find}} in France, so that in some sense Juliet Renny's drawings constitute a little historical record in their own right.|$|E
5|$|That same year, J.J. Thomson {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} which he channeled a stream of neon ions through magnetic and electric fields, striking a photographic plate at the other end. He observed two glowing patches on the plate, which suggested two different deflection trajectories. Thomson concluded this was <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the neon ions had a different mass. The nature of this differing mass would later {{be explained by the}} discovery of neutrons in 1932.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E
50|$|In computing, {{resident}} set size (RSS) is {{the portion}} of memory occupied by {{a process that is}} held in main memory (RAM). The rest of the occupied memory exists in the swap space or file system, either <b>because</b> <b>some</b> parts <b>of</b> the occupied memory were paged out, or <b>because</b> <b>some</b> parts <b>of</b> the executable were never loaded.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, the called {{equipment}} can end a call {{by going}} on-hook deliberately, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> specific signalling, or <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> time out.|$|R
5000|$|A link {{might be}} broken <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> form <b>of</b> {{blocking}} such as content filters or firewalls.|$|R
5|$|Author Michael Bradley {{and friend}} Deanna Theilmann-Beann searched for Mussie in the Nepenthe, a boat with sonar technology. With their sonar, they found two creatures they {{hypothesized}} could be two marine mammals, three metres long. Bradley concluded {{that at least}} one creature compatible with Mussie's description lived in the lake, though he did not investigate the creatures further. Scientists have also surveyed the area and found nothing, though the definitive nonexistence of a Mussie-like creature is difficult to establish <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the trenches in Muskrat Lake extend to over 60 metres.|$|E
5|$|Despite these precautions, {{pollution}} {{from the power}} stations was still a factor. In 1954, consideration was given to scrapping the plan to build the Union Hall housing estate in Lemington because of probable {{pollution from}} nearby power stations. This was mainly <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the houses were as high as, if not higher than, the power stations' chimneys. At times, this meant the estate being exposed {{to as much as}} 1.25 parts per million of sulphur dioxide. However the estate was still built, as these peak conditions were thought unlikely to occur on more than 18 days in a year.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Rosendo Pascual {{and colleagues}} {{described}} a jaw of Sudamerica. <b>Because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> this jaw's features {{were thought to}} be incompatible with a multituberculate identity, they regarded gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotherium) as Mammalia incertae sedis. However, in 2009 Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck argued in favor of a close relationship between gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotherium) and multituberculates. The controversy is partially due to disagreement over the assignment of two upper premolars and the jaw fragment described by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996; Gurovich and Beck identify these as Ferugliotherium, while Kielan-Jaworowska and others regard them as indeterminate multituberculates.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, Mr.Patil {{has one of}} {{the longest}} {{affidavits}} submitted to the Election Commission <b>of</b> India <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the aforementioned cases which are still pending in various courts.|$|R
50|$|Diagnosing Ganser {{syndrome}} is very challenging, <b>because</b> <b>some</b> measure <b>of</b> dishonesty is involved {{and because it}} is very rare.|$|R
50|$|His {{writings}} are now lost, {{though there}} is a (probably fictitious) work occasionally attributed to him titled De peregrinis regionibus. This is likely <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the confusion over his identity.|$|R
5|$|On 30 August, Furious left Belfast with {{a load of}} 49 Hurricanes, {{carrying}} three Fulmars of 800 Squadron {{and four}} Sea Hurricane IBs of 880A Squadron for self-defence, and nine Swordfish of 812 Squadron for Ark Royal. She arrived in Gibraltar on 6 September and transferred 40 Hurricanes to the other carrier the next day. Ark Royal sailed for the departure point the following day, but could only fly off 14 Hurricanes <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the Bristol Blenheim bombers used to guide the fighters to Malta failed to make their rendezvous. When Ark Royal returned, she transferred the six Swordfish of 810 Squadron to Furious and both carriers departed that same day to deliver the Hurricanes. This was Furiouss last ferry mission as she was sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for a lengthy refit. She arrived on 7 October and {{did not return to}} the United Kingdom until April 1942.|$|E
5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, {{that they would have}} expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|E
5|$|List of United States {{business}} school rankings is a tabular listing {{of some of}} the {{business school}}s and their affiliated universities located in the United States that are included in {{one or more of the}} rankings of full-time Master of Business Administration programs. Rankings are typically published by magazines or websites. This list is not a comprehensive list of business schools in the United States. These rankings are a subset of college and university rankings. Business schools are university-level institutions generally affiliated with a university or college that produces students who attain business administration degrees. Most of the schools listed in the rankings below are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Some of the publications shown here have related rankings for undergraduate, part-time and executive curricula. There is currently some controversy among faculty and administrators in American institutions of higher education regarding the request by the surveyors to have college presidents give their subjective opinion of other colleges <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the methodologies are deemed misleading and a disservice. This has resulted in a movement surrounding the President's letter.|$|E
5000|$|Because bencoded files contain binary data, and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> {{the intricacies}} {{involved}} in the way binary strings are typically stored, it is often not safe to edit bencode files in text editors.|$|R
50|$|Quintus Fabius Ambustus {{was made}} {{dictator}} of the Roman Republic in 321 BCE. He immediately resigned <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> kind <b>of</b> irregularity in his election.|$|R
50|$|This {{amplitude}} modulation (and vestigial SSB modulation) energy-saving mode was devised {{in the late}} 1930s. DCC was not implemented in transmitter designs until the 1980s, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> {{the complexities of the}} control circuit.|$|R
5|$|On 12November 1945, at {{the first}} general meeting of army leadership, General Sudirman– {{the leader of the}} Fifth Division in Purwokerto, who had two years {{military}} experience and was 23 years younger than Oerip– was elected leader of the army following two deadlocked votes. In the third round, Oerip had 21votes to Sudirman's 22. Divisional commanders from Sumatra, who had voted unanimously, swayed the vote in Sudirman's favour; Oerip had lost votes <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the division leaders distrusted his history with the KNIL and the oath he had taken to the Dutch motherland upon graduation. Although Sudirman was surprised at his selection and offered to surrender the leadership position to Oerip, the meeting did not allow it; Oerip himself was glad to no longer {{be in charge of the}} army. Sudirman kept Oerip, by then a lieutenant general, to serve as chief of staff under him. While Sudirman remained unconfirmed, Oerip remained de jure leader; however, the Indonesian journalist Salim Said writes that Oerip's orders were at times unintelligible owing to the leader's poor command of Indonesian and often ignored unless approved by Sudirman.|$|E
5|$|This {{particular}} disclosure {{has given}} rise to speculation as to whether, in addition to his efforts to rescue the Hungarian Jews, Wallenberg may have also been pursuing a parallel clandestine mission aimed at politically destabilizing Hungary’s pro-Nazi government on behalf of the OSS. This would also seem to add some credence to the potential explanation that it was his association with US intelligence that led to Wallenberg being targeted by Soviet authorities in January 1945. Several other humanitarians who had helped refugees during World War II disappeared behind the Iron Curtain in the period 1949/50, several years after Wallenberg’s disappearance. OSS ties may have been of interest to the Soviets, but are not a complete explanation <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> those detained, i.e. Hermann Field and Herta Field, had not worked for the OSS. All of these humanitarians, however, like Wallenberg, had interacted with a large number of anti-fascist and socialist refugees during the War, and this experience was used in the Stalin regime’s factional politics and show trials.|$|E
25|$|Taxes: <b>Because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> {{the gains}} from {{interest}} {{may be subject}} to taxes, the lender may insist on a higher rate to make up for this loss.|$|E
50|$|The {{book was}} met with {{controversy}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the revelations it contains. And those revelations reveal both a strength and weakness, in that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Moloney's sources were willing to speak in great detail but with the caveat that they remain confidential.|$|R
50|$|In 1740 he {{surveyed}} Stonehenge and the Stanton Drew stone circles. He later wrote extensively about Bladud and Neo-Druidism. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his designs {{he is also}} {{thought to have been}} involved in the early years of Freemasonry.|$|R
25|$|However, criticisms {{have been}} raised, for {{instance}} of the phonological-loop component, <b>because</b> <b>some</b> details <b>of</b> the findings are not easily explained by the original Baddeley & Hitch model.|$|R
25|$|Some of the {{metabolites}} in glycolysis have alternative {{names and}} nomenclature. In part, this is <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them {{are common to}} other pathways, such as the Calvin cycle.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{may have}} {{associated}} gynecological conditions which may require multidisciplinary management. History of constipation is important <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the operations may worsen constipation. Fecal incontinence may also influence {{the choice of}} management.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the rules}} for when to use ligatures, contractions, and {{abbreviations}} differ when a word is divided {{at the end of}} a line of text, <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them may not come in contact with the hyphen that divides the word. See the references for details.|$|E
5000|$|Quantum {{computers}} have gained widespread interest <b>because</b> <b>some</b> problems <b>of</b> practical interest {{are known to}} be in BQP, but suspected to be outside P. Some prominent examples are: ...|$|R
50|$|The Stoics {{held that}} all being (ὄντα) - {{though not all}} things (τινά) - is material. They {{accepted}} the distinction between concrete bodies and abstract ones, but rejected Aristotle's belief that purely incorporeal being exists. Thus, they accepted Anaxagoras' idea (as did Aristotle) that if an object is hot, it is <b>because</b> <b>some</b> part <b>of</b> a universal heat body had entered the object. But, unlike Aristotle, they extended the idea to cover all accidents. Thus if an object is red, it would be <b>because</b> <b>some</b> part <b>of</b> a universal red body had entered the object.|$|R
5000|$|Therefore, the multiplicative {{order of}} 17 (mod 71) is not {{necessarily}} 70 <b>because</b> <b>some</b> factor <b>of</b> 70 may also work above. So check 70 divided by its prime factors: ...|$|R
25|$|Scholars rate voting methods using mathematically-derived voting method criteria, which {{describe}} desirable {{features of}} a method. No ranked-preference method can meet all of the criteria, <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them are mutually exclusive, as shown by statements such as Arrow's impossibility theorem and the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, a case {{involving}} a family of 5 in Australia made headlines when they abruptly fled their home and traveled more than 1,600 km <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the family had become convinced someone was out to kill and rob them. No such evidence was found by the police.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{addressed}} {{whether the}} Rhode Island Supreme Court erred in holding that Petitioner {{did not have}} standing to claim a regulatory taking because he acquired the property after the enactment of regulations, and that Petitioner did not endure a total taking <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the parcel remains economically usable.|$|E
50|$|On 12 January, the Constitutional Court of Moldova annulled the {{inconclusive}} December election <b>because</b> <b>some</b> members <b>of</b> parliament {{violated the}} law by showing how they marked their ballots on television.|$|R
50|$|Parkerton {{is one of}} {{many places}} in Central Wyoming that grew rapidly with the {{discovery}} of oil and minerals in the region in 1889 and {{is often referred to as}} an oil field community <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the local employers in the area.|$|R
5000|$|Again, {{this does}} not show that the multiplicative order of 11 (mod 71) is 70 <b>because</b> <b>some</b> factor <b>of</b> 70 may also work. So check 70 divided by its prime factors: ...|$|R
