5|$|Admission {{continues}} to be via the Eleven Plus examination; The Judd School complies with the Co-ordinated Admission Scheme which {{is administered by the}} Kent Local Authority. All pupils must have gained a selective place through the Eleven Plus and placed The Judd School as a preference on their application form. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> is usually over-subscribed, priority is given to students in Local Authority Care in the first instance. Students are then ranked according to their aggregate scores in the Eleven Plus, and the distance from a students home to the school (as the crow flies) is used as a tiebreaker.|$|E
5|$|Benavidez Elementary School, {{which opened}} on Tuesday January 21, 1992, {{relieved}} Cunningham of around 675 students and 29 teachers. Benavidez, {{along with two}} other schools, {{was a part of}} a $370 million Houston ISD school construction project, which originated from a school bond approved in March 1989. Rose Garza, the principal of Benavidez, said that the committee determining the name of the school named it after Roy P. Benavidez, a soldier in the Vietnam War who was given the Medal of Honor, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> wanted to name the school after a Hispanic who could serve as a positive role model to the mostly Hispanic student body that occupied the school when it opened. HISD officials said that the district had little difficulty opening the three schools {{in the middle of the}} year, since the same teachers had been teaching the same students while they occupied the previously overcrowded schools in the preceding fall. On its opening day Benavidez referred 400 students to other schools due to overcrowding. After Benavidez opened, Benavidez and Cunningham each had about 700 students. In 1994, Benavidez had 1,065 pupils and it had to send 200 children to different schools. As of that year, 88% of Benavidez's children were Hispanic. By 1996, both Cunningham and Benavidez became overcrowded. Gordon also became a reliever school for Benavidez and another non-Gulfton school. SER-Niños opened in 1996. In 2000 Benavidez had 1,300 students and Cunningham had 1,190 students. At the schools, the average classroom size was 30 students, exceeding the state's recommendation of 22 students per classroom.|$|E

50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>school's</b> students, {{teachers}} and staff come from many nations (50 nationalities are {{represented on the}} five campuses, with 39 languages spoken at home), social studies and the concept {{that we are all}} citizens of one world are emphasized.

Chief Justice Sir Richard Garth, who was president of Bethune School paid a visit to Banga Mahila Vidyalaya and was highly pleased with the arrangements and the instruction imparted to the girls. The result was an offer from the committee of Bethune School to Banga Mahila Vidyalaya for amalgamation, which came about on 1 August 1878. With the amalgamation Bethune School entered a new phase in its history.|$|E

Between 24March and 26March, 722recruits arrived for training. On 26March 21platoons of women Marines began training with the WAVES and graduated on 25April 1943. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> was designated for WAVE instruction, the curriculum was geared for the Navy. Some subjects were not relevant for Marines, so modifications were made and Marine drill instructors were added. Training sessions included drill; physical training; customs and courtesies; history and organization; administration; naval law; map reading; defense against air attack; identification of aircraft, and safeguarding military information. Between March and July, 3,346women trained at Hunter College, 3,280 of whom graduated.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, McWilliams began {{a series}} of concerts at the school that gave {{students}} the opportunity to hear work by such contemporary musicians and performances as Korean composer Nam June Paik and his collaborator, cellist Charlotte Moorman; Japanese composer Takehisa Kosugi; German Happenings artist Wolf Vostell; the musician/composer team of La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela, and minimalist composer Terry Riley. The events were sometimes controversial. Paik and Moorman's concert was almost stopped when Moorman began a striptease as part of Paik's Pop Sonata. Riley's first-ever all-night concert, conceived by McWilliams and performed with Young and Zazeela on November 17–18, 1967, raised fears of litigation among school administrators. McWilliams's idea was that people could bring their families and sleeping bags and spend the night at the gallery, but <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> had never been open overnight before, administrators required him to personally carry liability insurance for the event.|$|E

25|$|Despite the College's liberal {{acceptance}} of various {{religious and ethnic}} groups, {{during the period from}} 1785–1849 the life of the college was a continuous struggle for existence, owing to inadequate means and lack of financial support. The curriculum of the college during the beginning of the 19th century was mostly focused studying the Classics. As a result, the major prerequisite for admission into the College was familiarity with Greek and Latin and a basic understanding of mathematics. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> had no athletic program, student life during this period was mainly focused around literary groups such as the Philolexian Society, which was founded in 1802. The average graduating class of the university during {{the first decade of the}} 19th century was seventeen. The main building which housed the College was decayed and unsightly in appearance; however, the funds of the College were augmented somewhat by the growing importance of its investments in real-estate, although the true wealth of these acquisitions wouldn't come to light till later in the century. In 1810, following the advice of a committee put together by members of the school, the College greatly increased its admission standards; nonetheless, admission of qualified students increased, with 135 students matriculating in 1810.|$|E

500|$|In 1783, Austen and {{her sister}} Cassandra were sent to Oxford to be educated by Mrs Ann Cawley who took them with her to Southampton when she moved there later in the year. In the autumn both girls were sent home when they caught typhus and Austen nearly died. Austen was from then home educated, until she {{attended}} boarding school in Reading with her sister from early in 1785 at the Abbey School House, ruled by Mrs La Tournelle, who possessed a cork leg and a passion for theatre. The school curriculum probably included some French, spelling, needlework, dancing and music and, perhaps, drama. The sisters returned home before December 1786 <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> fees for the two girls were too high for the Austen family.

Its reputation also derived from its innovative teaching methods, based on individual reading and research, followed by debates guided by the teacher. This focus on reading allowed Razakandrainy to discover a range of French novelists, among whom his favorites were Victor Hugo, Alfred de Musset, Charles Baudelaire, and Albert Samain. While enrolled at Paul Minault, Razakandrainy was given two nicknames: Sorajavona ("colors of the clouds", an acronym formed from the initials of his name), and later Dox, from both the English [...] "ox", and from [...] "paradox".|$|E
