25|$|The {{greatest}} literary influence upon Kafka was Flaubert's. Flaubert who loathed pretty-pretty prose {{would have}} applauded Kafka's attitude towards his tool. Kafka liked to draw his terms from {{the language of}} law and science, giving them a kind of ironic precision, with no intrusion of the author's private sentiments; this was exactly Flaubert's method through which he achieved a singular poetic effect. The legacy of his work habits can <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described,</b> therefore, as paving the way towards a slower and more introspective manner of writing.|$|E

25|$|Lighting control tools might <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as {{anything}} {{that changes the}} quality of the light. Historically this has been done by the use of intensity control. Technological advancements have made intensity control relatively simple - solid state dimmers are controlled by one or more lighting controllers. Controllers are commonly lighting consoles designed for sophisticated control over very large numbers of dimmers or luminaires, but may be simpler devices which play back stored sequences of lighting states with minimal user interfaces. Consoles are also referred to as lighting desks or light-boards.|$|E

The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Hayakawa earned a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor; he was also nominated for a Golden Globe for the role. After that film, Hayakawa largely retired from acting.

25|$|One non-trivial {{example is}} the fractal {{dimension}} of a Koch snowflake. It has a topological dimension of 1, but {{it is by no}} means a rectifiable curve: the length of the curve between any two points on the Koch snowflake is infinite. No small piece of it is line-like, but rather it is composed of an infinite number of segments joined at different angles. The fractal dimension of a curve can be explained intuitively thinking of a fractal line as an object too detailed to be one-dimensional, but too simple to be two-dimensional. Therefore its dimension might <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> not by its usual topological dimension of 1 but by its fractal dimension, which in this case is a number between one and two.|$|E

25|$|Lima's {{climate is}} largely {{reflective}} of the variant climate of Ohio. The region's climate can <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as a humid continental climate, according to the Koppen Climate Maps. The city lies roughly halfway between Toledo and Dayton, Ohio and weather is at a similar medium. Summers are hot and humid and winters are generally cool to cold, with moderate precipitation year-round. Due to the city's inland location the moderating effects of Lake Erie are diminished, causing the city to experience higher averages {{in the summer and}} colder plunges in the winter than Toledo. On average the city sees around 4 more inches of snow annually than Dayton. During the summer months, Lima is prone to smog and allergens lingering when heat indexes exceed 85°F.|$|E

500|$|Falk's {{enduring}} legacy can <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as the NBA's new star-centered focus. [...] Falk's {{idea was}} that since most people bought Chicago Bulls tickets to see Michael Jordan, Jordan himself should get {{a large proportion of}} the benefit."Basketball is a hybrid between an individual and team sport", Falk is saying. [...] "Very gifted players almost make a team by themselves. In that environment, a Michael Jordan, Alonzo Mourning, Juwan Howard, Shaquille O'Neal and Patrick Ewing bring in the fans. Fans come to watch them play primarily. They create marketing opportunities, new stadiums, luxury boxes, and they should be paid a disproportionate amount of money. The salary structure should be close to what it is in Hollywood, where Jim Carrey makes $16 million a film and the second star makes $2 million. That's what I believe as an economics major and as a neo-capitalist." ...|$|E

500|$|Back in Los Angeles, Beck {{began to}} work at a video store in Silver Lake [...] "doing things like {{alphabetizing}} the pornography section". He began performing in arthouse clubs and coffeehouses such as Al's Bar and Raji's. In order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music, Beck would play in a spontaneous, joking manner. [...] "I'd be banging away on a Son House tune and the whole audience would be talking. So maybe out of desperation or boredom, or the audience's boredom, I'd make up these ridiculous songs just to see if people were listening," [...] he later remarked. Virtually an unknown to the public and an enigma to those who met him, Beck would hop onstage between acts in local clubs and play [...] "strange folk songs", accompanied by [...] "what could <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as performance art" [...] while sometimes wearing a Star Wars stormtrooper mask.

500|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} hepatorenal syndrome is liver transplantation, {{and all other}} therapies can <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as bridges to transplantation. [...] While liver transplantation {{is by far the}} best available management option for HRS, the mortality of individuals with HRS {{has been shown to be}} as high as 25% within the first month after transplantation. [...] Individuals with HRS and evidence of greater hepatic dysfunction (quantified as MELD scores above 36) have been found to be at greatest risk of early mortality after liver transplantation. [...] A further deterioration of kidney function even after liver transplantation in individuals with HRS has been demonstrated in several studies; however, this is transient and thought to be due to the use of medications with toxicity to the kidneys, and specifically the introduction of immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine that are known to worsen kidney function. [...] Over the long-term, however, individuals with HRS who are the recipients of liver transplants almost universally recover kidney function, and studies show that their survival rates at three years are similar to those who have received liver transplants for reasons other than HRS.|$|E
500|$|The {{external}} appearance of Holkham can <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> {{as a huge}} Roman palace. However, as with most architectural designs, it is never quite that simple. Holkham is a Palladian house, and yet even by Palladian standards the {{external appearance}} is austere and devoid of ornamentation. This can almost certainly be traced to Coke himself. The on-site, supervising architect, Matthew Brettingham, related that Coke required and demanded [...] "commodiousness", which {{can be interpreted as}} comfort. Hence rooms that were adequately lit by one window, had only one, as a second might have improved the external appearance but could have made a room cold or draughty. As a result, the few windows on the piano nobile, although symmetrically placed and balanced, appear lost in a sea of brickwork; albeit these yellow bricks were cast as exact replicas of ancient Roman bricks expressly for Holkham. Above the windows of the piano nobile, where on a true Palladian structure the windows of a mezzanine would be, there is nothing. The reason for this is the double height of the state rooms on the piano nobile; however, not even a blind window, such as those often seen in Palladio's own work, is permitted to alleviate the severity of the facade. On the ground floor, the rusticated walls are pierced by small windows more reminiscent of a prison than a grand house. One architectural commentator, Nigel Nicolson, has described the house as appearing as functional as a Prussian riding school.|$|E
