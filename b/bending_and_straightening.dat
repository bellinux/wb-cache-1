The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body, where they function as scraping organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood.|$|E
25|$|After {{conversion}} to electrical operation the boat lift was operated successfully for 75 years. Regular maintenance was still necessary; for example, the wire ropes supporting the caissons suffered from fatigue from the repeated <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> {{as they ran}} over the overhead pulleys {{and had to be}} replaced frequently. However, maintenance was simpler than before the conversion because the mechanism of the electrical lift was above ground. Maintenance was also less expensive because the caissons were now designed to be run independently, allowing most maintenance to be carried out while one caisson remained operational and thus avoiding the need to close the lift entirely.|$|E

40|$|Passive-dynamic walkers are a {{class of}} robots that can walk down a ramp stably without {{actuators}} or control due to the mechanical dynamics of the robot. Using a passive-dynamic design {{as the basis for}} a powered robot helps to simplify the control problem and maximize energy efficiency compared to the traditional joint-angle control strategy. This thesis outlines the design of a knee for the robot known as Toddler, a passive-dynamic based powered walker built at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. An actuator at the knee allows the robot to <b>bend</b> <b>and</b> <b>straighten</b> the leg, but a clutch mechanism allows the actuator to completely disengage so that the leg can swing freely. The clutch operates by using a motor to rotate a lead screw which engages or disengages a set of spur gears. Control of the knee is accomplished by utilizing the robot’s sensors {{to determine whether or not}} the knee should be engaged. The engagement signal is then fed through a simple motor control circuit which controls the motor that turns the lead screw. The knee design was successfully implemented on Toddler but more work is required in order to optimize his walking. In order to study the dynamics of walking with knees, we also built a copy of McGeer’s original passive walker with knees...|$|R
50|$|The PowerSwim is {{a device}} {{somewhat}} like {{two pairs of}} long thin airplane wings, one pair {{at each end of}} an axis. The axis is fastened to a scuba diver's shins by straps round his legs. The longer pair of wings (about 6 ft wide or a bit less) is at his hips and the shorter pair is at his ankles. The wings rotate limitedly on axles near their front edges, and thus on upstroke and downstroke they propel water backwards. It is claimed that the length of the front wing lets it operate outside the cone of wake that starts at the diver's shoulders. It is claimed to let a scuba diver or swim much faster (250%) than with swimfins for the same amount of bodily effort, if used correctly, and being not motorized, it makes no motor noise to be heard by hostile hydrophones, but noise would occur if the front wings are allowed to hit the diver's hips at end of upstroke. It works somewhat like a penguin's or turtle's side-mounted front flippers. Its estimated cost is less than $500. The diver uses it by moving his legs up and down together, letting the knees <b>bend</b> <b>and</b> <b>straighten.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most {{steps are}} danced {{with a slight}} {{downward}} bouncing or dropping action. This action is created through the <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> of the knees, with bending occurring on the beats of 1 and 2, and the straightening occurring between. However, unlike the bouncing of, e.g., Polka, there is no considerable bobbing. Also, Samba has a specific hip action, different from that in ballroom Latin dances (Rumba and Cha-Cha-Cha).|$|E

50|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature by {{one year of}} age, while males take one-and-a-half-year before they mature. Breeding occurs {{throughout}} the year. When females gather, the males compete among {{each other for the}} right to mate, showing polygyny in males. The rutting male approaches the female in a lower bending posture, sniffing her vulva. The female may move slowly or react nervously. Even if the female flees, the male continues pursuing her steadily, without showing any sign of hurry. A receptive female will raise her head with her mouth wide open, following which the male will begin attempts at mounting. At the time of mounting the female lowers her head, while the male first <b>bends</b> <b>and</b> then <b>straightens</b> his forelegs <b>and</b> rests his head and neck on her back. The two remain together for one or two days, during which time the male ensures that no other male can approach the female.|$|R
40|$|Benign {{paroxysmal}} {{positional vertigo}} (BPPV) {{is one of}} the most common peripheral vestibular disorders characterised by a brief period of vertigo that occurs when the position of the head is altered with respect to gravity in a particular way: typically when turning over in bed, getting in and out of bed, <b>bending</b> over <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> up or extending the neck to look up. The condition is important to recognize because the vertigo can be very distressing, and because in most patients the diagnosis is easily made with a positioning test and it can be cured with a simple bedside manouvre. BPPV can result from several inner ear diseases, or head injury; in about half of the cases no cause can be found. The basic features of BPPV and the associated positioning vertigo and nystagmus were described by Robert Barany (1921) but it was not until 1952 that Dix and Hallpike described a provocative positioning manouvre and defined the syndrome clearly.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this paper is the shear {{capacity}} of in-situ cast joints between precast concrete panels. Current practice with vertical lowering of the wall panels experiences difficulties in the assembly phase, since the traditional U-bar connection requires an overlap in a horizontal plane to allow for the mounting of a vertical locking bar. Where limited space is available <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> subsequent <b>straightening</b> of the U-bars are required to assemble the adjacent panels, a procedure which imposes substantial ductility requirements on the reinforcement as well as some manual workload. This paper introduces a construction-friendly design with U-bars overlapping in the same plane as the panel itself. The design allows for a trouble-free vertical lowering of the panels without pre or post processing of the preinstalled reinforcement loops. Furthermore, an overall more ductile behavior of the joint is obtained. The solution is tested in a push-off experimental setup and the influence of important geometric parameters of the keyed shear joint is investigated. The first peak load carrying capacity is assessed using plasticity models, and the failure modes are identified by the use of digital image correlation. The upper bound models produce satisfactory results capturing the experimental tendencies and predicting the mode of shear failure in the shear keys...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} effects of reverse <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> process on the mechanical properties of a typical carbon steel bar used for civil engineering applications. Twenty four specimens each were used for the metallogarphy, microhardness and tensile tests. The investigation revealed that the reverse <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> process has no significant effect on the bars’ through-thickness microstructure and hardness. However, the reverse <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> process reduces the yield load, ultimate load, and displacement at fracture of the bars by 4. 27 %, 2. 58 %, and 18. 62 % respectively. These results highlight the need to take into consideration the effects of the previous loading history of the bars/wires, particularly the reduction in the displacement at fracture and consequently, the ductility of the bars/wires in the design and fitness for purpose assessment of components made from them, since the bars/wires could experience high strain during installation and in service due to overloads...|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that {{stainless}} steel 304 (SS 304) containing martensite is susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. This generated concern regarding the structural integrity of SS 304 tubing we use in the W 87 pit tube. During surveillance operations, the pit tube undergoes a series of <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> as it goes through a number of surveillance cycles. This motivated the study to characterize austenitic SS 304 tubing obtained from Rocky Flats. The tubes continued to display structural soundness even after numerous repeated <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> cycles. The minimum and maximum number of bends to failure occurred after 13 and 16 cycles, respectively. After 5 bends, both the inner and outer surfaces of the tubing showed no microcracks. When the bent tubing samples were pressurized and tested using deuterium at 74 {degrees}C and at {approximately} 78 {degrees}C, they failed away from the bent area. Thus deuterium embrittlement of the bent SS 304 tubing should not be a problem. Moreover, to increase our 95 % confidence level to 5 bends, we are planning to perform at least four additional bends to failure tests...|$|E

40|$|Gravitropism, {{the slow}} {{reorientation}} of plant growth {{in response to}} gravity, is a key determinant of the form and posture of land plants. Shoot gravitropism is triggered when statocysts sense the local angle of the growing organ relative to the gravitational field. Lateral transport of the hormone auxin to the lower side is then enhanced, resulting in differential gene expression and cell elongation causing the organ to bend. However, {{little is known about}} the dynamics, regulation, and diversity of the entire <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> process. Here, we modeled the <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> of a rod-like organ and compared it with the gravitropism kinematics of different organs from 11 angiosperms. We show that gravitropic straightening shares common traits across species, organs, and orders of magnitude. The minimal dynamic model accounting for these traits is not the widely cited gravisensing law but one that also takes into account the sensing of local curvature, what we describe here as a graviproprioceptive law. In our model, the entire dynamics of the bending/straightening response is described by a single dimensionless “bending number” B that reflects the ratio between graviceptive and proprioceptive sensitivities. The parameter B defines both the final shape of the organ at equilibrium and the timing of curving and straightening. B can be estimated from simple experiments, and the model can then explain most of the diversity observed in experiments. Proprioceptive sensing is thus as important as gravisensing in gravitropic control, and the B ratio can be measured as phenotype in genetic studies...|$|E

50|$|Since ~3000 yr BP (= years Before Present), human {{impact is}} seen in the delta. As a result of {{increasing}} land clearance (Bronze Age agriculture), in the upland areas (central Germany), the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has speeded up. This has caused increased flooding and sedimentation, ending peat formation in the delta. In the geologically recent past the main process distributing sediment across the delta has been the shifting of river channels to new locations on the floodplain (termed avulsion). Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred. Direct human impact in the delta began with the mining of peat for salt and fuel from Roman times onward. This was followed by embankment of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11-13th century AD. Thereafter, canals were dug, <b>bends</b> were <b>straightened</b> <b>and</b> groynes were built to prevent the river's channels from migrating or silting up.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Increased spasms in {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) patients, whose {{spasticity}} was previously well controlled with intrathecal baclofen therapy, are due to (in order of frequency) drug tolerance, increased stimulus, low reservoir volume, catheter malfunction, disease progression, human error, and pump mechanical failure. We present a SCI patient, in whom bladder calculi acted as red herring for increased spasticity whereas the real cause was spontaneous extrusion of catheter from intrathecal space. Case Presentation A 44 -year-old male sustained a fracture of C 5 / 6 and incomplete tetraplegia at C- 8 level. Medtronic Synchromed pump for intrathecal baclofen therapy was implanted 13 months later to control severe spasticity. The tip of catheter was placed at T- 10 level. The initial dose of baclofen was 300 micrograms/day of baclofen, administered by a simple continuous infusion. During a nine-month period, he required increasing doses of baclofen (875 micrograms/day) to control spasticity. X-ray of abdomen showed multiple radio opaque shadows {{in the region of}} urinary bladder. No malfunction of the pump was detected. Therefore, increased spasticity was attributed to bladder stones. Electrohydraulic lithotripsy of bladder stones was carried out successfully. Even after removal of bladder stones, this patient required further increases in the dose of intrathecal baclofen (950, 1050, 1200 and then 1300 micrograms/day). Careful evaluation of pump-catheter system revealed that the catheter had extruded spontaneously and was lying in the paraspinal space at L- 4, where the catheter had been anchored before it entered the subarachnoid space. A new catheter was passed into the subarachnoid space and the tip of catheter was located at T- 8 level. The dose of intrathecal baclofen was decreased to 300 micrograms/day. Conclusion Vesical calculi acted as red herring for resurgence of spasticity. The real cause for increased spasms was spontaneous extrusion of whole length of catheter from subarachnoid space. Repeated <b>bending</b> forwards <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> of torso for pressure relief and during transfers from wheel chair probably contributed to spontaneous extrusion of catheter from spinal canal in this patient. </p...|$|R
