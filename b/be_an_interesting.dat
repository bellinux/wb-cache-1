5|$|To {{demonstrate}} Henry's immortality, Miller {{decided that}} Henry would die and {{would feel the}} pain every time he died. Anything on Henry's body would disappear with his body during each death. Miller felt that Henry's naked rebirth in water would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> {{way to keep the}} show's protagonist alive during the series by completing the death and rebirth process; the nakedness would create several comedic moments within the series. Miller intended to use Henry's death and rebirth process sporadically after the first two episodes so that the series would focus on Henry's long life.|$|E
5|$|Though the Mellotron was not {{extensively}} {{used in the}} 1980s, {{a number}} of bands featured it as a prominent instrument. One of the few UK post-punk bands to do so was Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, who featured it heavily on their platinum-selling 1981 album Architecture & Morality. Andy McCluskey has stated they used the Mellotron because they were starting to run into limitations of the cheap monophonic synthesizers they had used up to that point. He bought a second-hand M400 and was immediately impressed with the strings and choir sounds. XTC's Dave Gregory recalls seeing bands using Mellotrons when {{growing up in the}} 1970s, and thought it would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> addition to the group's sound. He bought a second-hand model in 1982 for £165, and first used it on the album Mummer (1983). IQ's Martin Orford bought a second-hand M400 and used it primarily for visual appeal rather than musical quality or convenience.|$|E
5|$|On October 28, Persis Khambatta {{was hired}} to portray Ilia. She had been {{required}} to wear a bald cap for her screen test, although {{at this point the}} character also wore elaborate headgear in some footage. Roddenberry was insistent on this as a character attribute, but others such as Eisner hated the idea of a bald female character. His notes said that while a bald female character would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> addition, it may prevent the audience from feeling at ease with Ilia and so the style may need to be given to a different character entirely. The auditions by this time were not held under the pretence that they were to play a part in a television series, but were openly talking about Star Trek becoming a feature film. The casting for Willard Decker had been delayed, both because of a slight delay in the production but also because the writers were no longer sure that the character was needed at all. This was despite auditions being conducted {{at the same time that}} Gautreaux was cast as Xon, during which, in his second audition with Barrett, he also read lines against ten actors competing for the role of Decker.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} stage, glorification of the {{religious}} beliefs and lives was the theme {{of most of the}} novels. Later on, picturization of real Bengali life became a common topic. By the end of the fifties, the novelists gradually turned to human mind and its analysis. A great change of the theme came after 1971.

25|$|Sewage and fecal sludge management: In cholera-affected areas, {{sewage and}} fecal sludge {{need to be}} treated and managed {{carefully}} {{in order to stop}} the spread of this disease via human excreta. Provision of sanitation and hygiene is an important preventative measure. Open defecation, release of untreated sewage, or dumping of fecal sludge from pit latrines or septic tanks into the environment need to be prevented. In many cholera affected zones, there is a low degree of sewage treatment. Therefore, the implementation of dry toilets that do not contribute to water pollution, as they do not flush with water, may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> alternative to flush toilets.|$|E
25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning.

After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E

500|$|Another {{realization}} of the correspondence states that M-theory on [...] {{is equivalent to the}} so-called (2,0)-theory in six dimensions. In this example, the spacetime of the gravitational theory is effectively seven-dimensional. The existence of the (2,0)-theory that appears {{on one side of the}} duality is predicted by the classification of superconformal field theories. It is still poorly understood because it is a quantum mechanical theory without a classical limit.

500|$|Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard {{was adamant}} {{that despite the}} defeat Liverpool would come back {{stronger}} next season: [...] "We've got to pick ourselves up, have a good rest {{in the summer and}} then go again next season."

Gerrard echoed his manager's sentiments in regards to new players joining the club: [...] "We need to strengthen and bring some quality into the club.

500|$|Chapman {{considered}} {{the concept of}} an elderly Bond to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> one, with Bond referring to Connery's Bond as a [...] "sexual acrobat who leaves a trail of beautiful dead women behind like blown roses". In line with the literary Bond, Niven's character drives a vintage Bentley, rather than the Aston Martin favoured by Connery. Bond scholar Steven Jay Rubin thought Niven perfectly cast as the retired Bond, and saw him as [...] "a throw-back to the hell-for-leather adventure heroes" [...] of the character, which paralleled Niven's own life and career. Barnes and Hearn describe this as a [...] "perfectly fair interpretation", given the way Niven approached the role, while Raymond Benson thinks casting Niven was [...] "intelligent". Jeremy Black questioned the use of Niven in the role, observing that he {{did not seem to be}} a killer, and did not have the [...] "disconcerting edge" [...] that Connery had.|$|E

[...] Marley continued: [...] "I suppose it may now be taken as an admitted fact, that the prosperity or depression of the iron and coal trades regulates, in a very material degree, the prosperity or depression of nearly all other commercial pursuits in the same locality." ...|$|E

Some music critics heavily criticized the track for its {{sampling of the}} [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech, while others found it to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> song. Jason Damas of PopMatters unfavorably compared the song to OutKast's [...] "Spread" [...] and claimed that Stefani [...] "awkwardly comment on race relations and as such it's {{a bit of a}} buzzkill". Krissi Murison of the British magazine, NME, also was negative with her review, claiming that the track is a [...] "bar the knuckle-bitingly bad duet", further adding that every song on Love. Angel. Music. Baby. sounds like a future hit, minus [...] "Long Way to Go". Nick Sylvester of Pitchfork Media remained indifferent of the song as he thought that the song's lyrics [...] "feel out of place on an otherwise carefree album" [...] and preferred Stefani and 3000's other collaboration, [...] "Bubble Pop Electric".|$|E

Hewis found the track to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> exploration of Scar, and felt its removal from current productions of the musical was disappointing. Featuring it {{as an example of}} why Scar was one of the [...] "15 most terrifying musical theater villains", Backstage's KC Wright described it as a [...] "snarling signature song". Megan Green of Australian Stage wrote that [...] "The Madness of King Scar" [...] was an example of one of the [...] "new, and equally memorable, songs" [...] created for the musicals.

500|$|Russell Lewin of SFX gave [...] "Cold War" [...] {{four out}} of five stars, praising the set and {{direction}} as well as the Ice Warrior. On the other hand, Lewin noted that, as a base-under-siege story, it did not play with the narrative form or [...] "go anywhere we couldn't have predicted," [...] {{with the exception of the}} Ice Warrior breaking out of its suit. IGN's Mark Snow gave the episode a rating of 8.3 out of 10. Snow praised the reintroduction of the Ice Warriors and called Skaldak [...] "the show's most memorable villain in a while, thanks to his stern, occasionally psychopathic approach to problem solving, and an environment that helped make the bulky, heavy creature design imposing rather than laughably naff." [...] However, he felt that some of Skaldak's effects were [...] "laughably rubbery" [...] and that his motivations were [...] "psychotically random." [...] Tor.com reviewer Emily Asher-Perrin was more critical of the episode, pointing out that little happened.

500|$|Critics {{applauded the}} growing {{relationship}} between Andrea and Shane, {{as well as}} Dale's confrontation with Shane. Despite describing them as an [...] "unlikely pairing", Meslow asserted that it was superior to the storyline between Andrea and Dale. [...] "There's {{something to be said}} for the occasional post-apocalyptic tryst, which allows two characters who've experienced almost nothing but misery to have, even for a moment, something that resembles joy," [...] he articulated. Meslow retorted that it was wise to underplay the tryst between Shane and Andrea, which he predicted would not lead to anything serious. Venable wrote: [...] " [...] Dale’s lack of personality traits, beyond being the wise sage who gets in everyone’s business, makes him an unpredictable foe in my book, and could be as interesting as Shane’s violent selfishness." [...] Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy avouched that Shane continued to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> character; [...] "Just as we were beginning to like him again, he murdered Otis in cold blood. And it seems like his downward spiral is set to continue—he's threatening poor Dale and embarking on an ill-advised affair with Andrea." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Benítez was {{confident}} that victory in the match would provide his side with a boost ahead of their opening match of the 2006–07 Premier League with Sheffield United: [...] "This {{will give us a}} lot of confidence I am sure, to play one of the best sides in the world and to beat them, this should give us more confidence going into what will <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> season." [...] He also defended his decision to players such as Gerrard and Alonso on the bench: [...] "It was my idea to start with the players that had the most fitness and have played the most minutes. Then I wanted to bring the other players on towards the end. It worked and it showed that we have a great squad – better than last season." [...] Crouch, scorer of the winning goal, was also confident the result would boost the Liverpool squad: [...] "There is a bit of rivalry between the sides and it is great to get an early one over them. Make no bones about it, this is a big game to win and it certainly could give us a psychological edge this season." ...|$|E
