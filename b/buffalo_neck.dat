40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 30  year old man managed in an out of {{hospital}} setting for a cardiorespiratory arrest. The patient was impossible to intubate under direct laryngoscopy because of a severe mouth opening limitation associated with a <b>buffalo</b> <b>neck.</b> After failure of direct laryngoscopy and intubating laryngeal mask airway, an Eschmann tracheal tube introducer (gum elastic bougie) was introduced through a nostril. The bougie could be blindly inserted into the trachea, and the patient was intubated using the bougie as a guide. Tracheal intubation was then confirmed using the syringe aspiration test and end tidal carbon dioxide detection...|$|E

The world was {{under attack by}} Mahishasura, the most evil demon in the world, who took many different forms, including that of a buffalo. The male gods, fearing total annihilation endowed Durga with their powers. Riding a lion into battle, Durga slew the buffalo by cutting off its head and then she destroyed {{the spirit of the}} demon as it emerged from the <b>buffalo's</b> severed <b>neck.</b> It is through this act that order was established in the world." ...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the rare}} nature of Madelung’s disease many clinicians {{will not have}} seen a patient with it {{and will not be}} able to {{recognise}} them: subsequently a diagnosis is unlikely to be made. Keywords rare disease, lipomatosis, Google image, fat tissue Madelung’s disease is a rare condition which is char-acterized with large symmetrical accumulation of noncapsulated fat tissue in the face and <b>neck</b> (<b>buffalo</b> hump), trunk and rarely in the upper and lower limbs (pseudoathletic). Aetiology is unknown and may lead to great dis-advantages emotionally and even socially; further studies are needed to characterize the pathogenesis and histologic findings of this rare adverse event...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of antiretroviral therapy (ART) {{has been one}} of the most dramatic progressions in the history of medicine. Concomitant with this momentous therapeutic advance, the mitochondrial toxicities of ART were recognized as an important clinical entity. Aim: The aim was to study the mitochondrial toxicities in terms of peripheral neuropathy (PN), lipodystrophy (LD), hepatic steatosis, lactic academia (LA), and pancreatitis developing in AIDS cases on nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) based ART regimens. Materials and Methods: An observational study, which included 90 AIDS cases, receiving first line ART regimens containing two NRTIs (zidovudine [AZT]/stavudine [d 4 T] with lamivudine [3 TC]) and one nonNRTIs (nevirapine/efavirenz) was conducted at Skin-VD outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital attached to a Medical College. Thorough history was taken, and clinical examination was done. Cases were subjected to measurements of abdominal girth and mid-arm circumference, liver function tests, blood sugar, lipid profile, serum lactate, and amylase levels. Results: Of 90 cases on ART, 66 % were males and 34 % were females. Mitochondrial toxicities developed in 26 (30 %) cases out of 90, which included 3 (7 %) out of 42 cases on AZT + 3 TC and 23 (48 %) out of 48 cases on d 4 T + 3 TC. Most common toxicity was PN seen in 20 (22 %) cases; male cases developed PN at a lower CD 4 count than female cases. LD was observed in total of 13 (14. 5 %) cases; deposition of fat in the abdomen in seven cases and at the nape of the <b>neck</b> (<b>buffalo</b> hump) in one case while loss of fat from extremities was seen in seven cases and loss of buccal fat in seven cases. Women presented more with fat accumulation (breast and abdomen), while men with loss of fat (limbs and buttocks). Both PN and LD were more common in d 4 T based regimen. LA was reported in one case on d 4 T. Hepatic steatosis was seen in three cases and pancreatitis in one case receiving AZT. Conclusion: Regular monitoring and early diagnosis of mitochondrial toxicities with timely switch to safer alternatives is of utmost importance...|$|R
