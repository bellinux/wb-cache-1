5|$|The AESC {{continued}} to snub the government. Playford advocated {{the use of}} <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> from the South Australian Leigh Creek mine to avoid supply complications, and even made into law a bill encouraging its use. He also championed {{the development of the}} town and the expansion of the mine, which had been dormant for several decades, to ease the state's dependency on imported coal. Much state and federal government money was invested in the scheme, the town infrastructure was built, and the production started in February 1944. Shortly afterwards, the AESC responded by buying new boilers which would only be able to the more productive black coal. With more conflicts ensuing, and even with the company slowly relenting, Playford did not stop his struggle. A Royal Commission in March 1945 was appointed to ascertain a solution between the two parties, and presented its report in August with a recommendation that the AESC be nationalised. A few months later, Playford's stance received a boost when heavy strikes in New South Wales forced shutdowns in South Australia that saw thousands of labourers out of work. By then {{at the head of the}} only conservative government in the nation, when Playford requested commonwealth funds to assist in the nationalisation of the AESC Prime Minister Chifley responded with glee and enthusiasm. On 11 October, he presented a bill to Parliament to nationalise the AESC and create the Electricity Trust of South Australia.|$|E

40|$|The US has {{invested}} heavily in research, development, and demonstration of efficient and environmentally acceptable technologies {{for the use of}} coal. The US has the opportunity to use its leadership position to market a range of advanced coal-based technologies internationally. For example, coal mining output in the Czech Republic has been decreasing. This decrease in demand can be attributed mainly to the changing structure of the Czech economy and to environmental constraints. The continued production of energy from indigenous <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> is a major concern for the Czech Republic. The strong desire to continue to use this resource is a challenge. The Energy and Environmental Research Center undertook two major efforts recently. One effort involved an assessment of opportunities for commercialization of US coal technologies in the Czech Republic. This report is the result of that effort. The technology assessment focused on the utilization of Czech <b>brown</b> <b>coals.</b> These coals are high in ash and sulfur, and the information presented in this report focuses on the utilization of these <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> in an economically and environmentally friendly manner.

40|$|Chemical {{structure}} {{changes during}} drying of Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coals,</b> that is, Loy Yang (LY) and Yallourn (YL), in hot air, nitrogen, and superheated steam are quantitatively studied using the FTIR technique. The infrared (IR) spectra of raw and dried coals were curve-fitted {{to a series}} of bands in hydroxyl groups (3500 – 3000 cm – 1), aliphatic hydrogen (3000 – 2800 cm – 1), and carbonyl and aromatic carbon (1850 – 1500 cm – 1) adsorption regions. Following air drying, the IR adsorption of aliphatic structures decreased significantly, indicating that oxidation reaction mainly takes place on these structures. Carbonyl and carboxyl groups decreased up to 130 °C by 25. 9 % and 23. 9 %, respectively, and then significantly increased at higher temperatures due to oxidation. Drying of <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> in nitrogen resulted in a significant increase in their aromaticity and a lower concentration of oxygen-containing functional groups. The loss of oxygen was confirmed by measuring the O/C ratio of raw and dried samples. The O/C ratio decreased by 30. 8 % and 40. 7 % for LY and YL coals, respectively, after drying at 200 °C for 10 min. Superheated steam fluidized-bed drying of both LY and YL coals showed the breakage of some weak aliphatic C–H structures. The decrease in adsorption of hydroxyl, carboxyl, and carbonyl groups leads to loss of oxygen in both LY and YL steam-dried coals. Superheated steam drying of <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> showed only minor changes to the coal organic structure as the aromatic carbon content remained relatively unchanged and aliphatic structures decreased negligibly...|$|R
