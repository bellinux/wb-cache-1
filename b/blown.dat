40|$|In this study, {{tangential}} and perpendicular steady <b>blowing</b> at {{the trailing}} edge of NACA 0012 airfoil is investigated numerically to flow separation control and {{to study the}} effects of <b>blowing</b> amplitude and <b>blowing</b> coefficient on airfoil aerodynamic characteristics. Flow was fully turbulent with the Reynolds number of 5 ൈ 105 and the turbulent employed model was the Menter’s shear stress model. <b>Blowing</b> on airfoil is modeled in tangential (tangential <b>blowing)</b> and perpendicular (perpendicular <b>blowing)</b> form and length of <b>blowing</b> jet is 3. 5 percent of chord length. Considering previous studies, <b>blowing</b> jet is optimum in two distances on the airfoil surface, one around 40 percent and the other around 80 percent of chord length from the leading edge, which in this study <b>blowing</b> jet is placed at 80 percent of the chord length from the leading edge. <b>Blowing</b> velocity from 0. 1 to 0. 5 is considered of freestream velocity. Results of tangential <b>blowing</b> show that by increasing amplitude of <b>blowing,</b> lift and drag coefficients changes are inconsiderable. Maximum increase of lift to drag ratio in amplitude of 0. 5, around 16. 5 percent, but in perpendicular <b>blowing</b> lower amplitude of <b>blowing</b> is more appropriate.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} <b>blowing</b> and its {{parameters}} including the jet amplitude, <b>blowing</b> coefficient and jet width {{in order to}} flow control was evaluated for a NACA 0012 airfoil. The flow was considered as fully turbulent with the Reynolds number of 5 · 10 ^ 5, and the Menter shear stress turbulent model was employed. Tangential and perpendicular <b>blowing</b> at the trailing edge were applied on the airfoil upper surface, and the jet widths were varied from 1. 5 to 4 percent of the chord length, and the jet amplitude was also selected 0. 1, 0. 3 and 0. 5. In the tangential <b>blowing,</b> {{the results showed that}} when the <b>blowing</b> amplitude increases, the lift-to-drag ratio rises by 15 percent, however, the smaller amounts of the <b>blowing</b> amplitude are more effective in the perpendicular <b>blowing.</b> Furthermore, when the <b>blowing</b> jet width rises, the lift-to-drag ratio increases continuously in the tangential <b>blowing</b> and decreases quasi-linear in the perpendicular <b>blowing.</b> In this study, the <b>blowing</b> jet width 3. 5 and 4 percent of the chord length for the tangential <b>blowing</b> was selected as optimal values as well as smaller amounts of <b>blowing</b> jet width are more suitable for the perpendicular <b>blowing.</b> Finally, the lift-to-drag ratio was increased by 17 percent for the tangential <b>blowing</b> in the angle of attack of 18 degrees...|$|R
