5|$|Allied naval commanders {{decided to}} use battleships to conduct a series of attacks against Japanese coastal cities in mid-1945.

However, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters had anticipated that the Allies would conduct bombardments and other operations with this goal, and decided to not attack naval forces operating off Japan. Instead, the aircraft would remain in reserve until Allied landing operations in the home islands began.|$|E

In November 1992, the Nagano Winter Olympic Organizing Committee and IOC Coordination Committee reached an agreement to include curling in the official programme of the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. Both the men's and women's tournaments have been held at every Winter Olympics since.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of Japanese air {{opposition}} to the American bomber raids, VIIFighter Command was solely tasked with ground attack missions from July. These raids were frequently made against airfields to destroy aircraft <b>being</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> reserve to attack the expected Allied invasion fleet. While the P-51 pilots only occasionally encountered Japanese fighters in the air, the airfields were protected by anti-aircraft batteries and barrage balloons. By the end of the war, VIIFighter Command had conducted 51 ground attack raids, of which 41 were considered successful. The fighter pilots claimed to have destroyed or damaged 1,062 aircraft and 254 ships along with large numbers of buildings and railway rolling stock. American losses were 91 pilots killed and 157 Mustangs destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Following the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which took place while six American-Hawaiian ships were <b>being</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> various Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, {{coupled with the}} fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan in late April. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to the canal route.|$|E
5|$|From January 1995, the {{frequency}} between Steinkjer and Melhus was increased slightly.

In 1997, NSB stated that the Trøndelag Commuter Rail was unprofitable and threatened to terminate it, along {{with an array of}} other services, if funding was not increased. The same year, 750,000 people traveled with the commuter rail.

5|$|Hezbollah {{says that}} its {{continued}} hostilities against Israel are justified as reciprocal to Israeli operations against Lebanon and as retaliation {{for what they}} claim is Israel's occupation of Lebanese territory. Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, and their withdrawal was verified by the United Nations as being in accordance with resolution 425 of 19 March 1978, however Lebanon considers the Shebaa farms—a 26-km² (10-mi²) piece of land captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 war and considered by the UN to be Syrian territory occupied by Israel—to be Lebanese territory. Additionally, Hezbollah claims that three Lebanese prisoners are <b>being</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> Israel. Finally, Hezbollah consider Israel to be an illegitimate state.
