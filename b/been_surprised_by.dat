5|$|Roosevelt had <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> {{the outcome}} of the Republican convention, having {{expected}} to oppose a conservative isolationist. The polls showed Willkie behind by only six points, and the president expected this to be a more difficult race than he had faced in his defeats of Hoover and Landon. Roosevelt felt that Willkie's nomination would remove the war issue from the campaign. Roosevelt was nominated by the Democratic convention in Chicago in July, though he stated that because of the world crisis, he would not actively campaign, leaving that to surrogates. The fact that both major-party presidential candidates favored intervention frustrated isolationists, who considered wooing Charles Lindbergh as a third party candidate.|$|E
5|$|More than 40 {{hours after}} the {{offensive}} began, substantial columns of the Seventh Ottoman Army were seen withdrawing northeastwards from Nablus, {{in the direction of}} the Jordan River where many would be captured by the 11th Cavalry Brigade of the 4th Cavalry Division. Liman von Sanders, the commander of the Yildirim Army Group, had <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the arrival of EEF cavalry at Nazareth in the early hours of 20 September. With no combat formations available to stop the EEF cavalry, he and his staff were forced to retire from Nazareth, driving via Tiberias, to reach Samakh in the late afternoon. Here he made arrangements to establish a strong rearguard garrison in what he planned would be the center of a rearguard line which was to stretch from Lake Hule to Irbid. Liman von Sanders drove on to Deraa on the morning of 21 September, where he received a report from the Ottoman Fourth Army, which he ordered to withdraw to the Deraa-to-Irbid line, without waiting for the southern Hejaz garrisons. He subsequently continued his journey back to Damascus.|$|E
5|$|Connery and Salomon {{eventually}} dropped out, and in September 1995, Robert Rodriguez, {{fresh from}} the success of Desperado, signed to direct with Antonio Banderas, who had also starred in Desperado, playing the title role. TriStar and Amblin had <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> Rodriguez's low-budget filming techniques for his action films, El Mariachi and Desperado, and shifted away from their initial plans with Salomon to make a big-budget version of Zorro. Spielberg had hoped Rodriguez would start filming in January 1996 for a Christmas release date, but the start date was pushed back to July. The release date was later moved to Easter 1997. Rodriguez {{pulled out of the}} film' in June 1996 over difficulties coming to terms with TriStar on the budget. The studio projected a range of $35 million, while Rodriguez wanted $45 million. They both attempted to compromise when Rodriguez lowered it to $42 million, but the studio refused and set $41 million as their highest mark. Banderas remained with the production, and Martin Campbell signed on later that month, turning down the chance to direct Tomorrow Never Dies. The finished screenplay would be written by John Eskow, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, based on a story by Elliott, Rossio, and Randall Jahnson.|$|E

5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} {{the capture of}} Junon, Guadeloupe was the only French colony in the Caribbean not under attack; Martinique fell to the British on 24 February and Spanish forces continued their Siege of Santo Domingo. The French did make further attempts to resupply the islands; a major expedition was defeated off Guadeloupe in April, and elements of this force that reached the island were defeated and captured during June and July. With British forces distracted by the ongoing Reconquista in Santo Domingo, {{the focus of the}} campaign moved north, and it was not until a second major expedition arrived in December that significant British forces returned to the Leeward Islands for the final invasion of Guadeloupe. The influx of British reinforcements was too late for HMS Junon; on 13 December she had been cruising alone to the east of Antigua and <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> François Roquebert's squadron of four French frigates. Outnumbered and surrounded, Junon fought hard but was eventually forced to surrender after Captain John Shortland was mortally wounded. Reduced to a sinking condition in the engagement, Junon was set on fire and abandoned by Roquebert, whose ships were intercepted five days later off Guadeloupe and defeated: two were destroyed and two others returned to France without landing their supplies.|$|E

25|$|Before {{becoming}} an official manga author, Masashi Kishimoto decided he should try creating a Chanbara manga since Weekly Shōnen Jump had not published a title from that genre.

25|$|The Saxon and Austrian armies were {{unprepared}} for Frederick's preemptive strike, and their forces were scattered; Prussians occupied Dresden {{with little or}} no resistance from the Saxons. At the Battle of Lobositz on 1 October, Frederick prevented the isolated Saxon army from being reinforced by an Austrian army under General Browne. The Prussians then fully occupied Saxony; after the Siege of Pirna ended later in October, the Saxon army surrendered and was forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army. Britain had <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the sudden Prussian offensive but now began shipping supplies and subsidies to its new ally.|$|E
25|$|However, {{several days}} later the Frontier Corps began a {{large-scale}} offensive {{under the command of}} Major-General Tariq Khan, codenamed Operation Sherdil (Lionheart), with the objective of regaining control of Bajaur from the Taliban. About 8,000 troops belonging to the FC and Army were involved, backed by Cobra attack helicopters and fighter jets that pounded Taliban holdouts. To support the Army, Pakistan Air Force responded with aggressive air campaigns. Pakistani military sources indicate that the army has <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the resistance the insurgents have been putting up. The Taliban have been using advanced tactics, fighting from prepared defenses.|$|E
25|$|This testing also {{demonstrated}} two unexpected and ultimately very useful {{features of the}} spiral scan system. The first was that since the scanning pattern crossed the ground when the antenna was pointed down, the ground returns produced a series of curved stripes along the lower portion of the display. This formed an analogue of an artificial horizon, one that radar operators found extremely useful in combat because they could immediately see if the pilot was responding correctly to their commands. Various {{members of the team}} record having <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> this outcome, noting that the effect was obvious in retrospect and should have been predicted.|$|E

25|$|On Monday, October 7, 1985, four PLF militants hijacked Achille Lauro off Egypt. The hijackers had <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> a {{crew member}} and acted prematurely. The Palestinians had hidden their weapons in the gas tank of a car parked in Italian in {{preparation}} for boarding the ship. Their smuggled weapons still with gasoline residue on them, gave off a smell that the crew had noticed but had not acted on. A cabin steward, with the hijackers' stateroom in his responsibilities, surprised the four Palestinians (as {{they were trying to}} use a hairdryer to clean the residue off their weapons) by entering the unlocked door to their room in order to deliver complimentary fruit. The hijackers plan to launch an attack on Ashdod, Israel was put aside as the terrorists panicked and moved to hijack the ship instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{fortified}} camp at Sidi Omar was {{ringed with}} barbed wire, trenches and minefields. On 11 June 1940, the 11th Hussars in Rolls-Royce and Morris CS9 armoured cars closed {{up to the}} frontier wire, crossed during the night and exchanged fire with the garrison at Sidi Omar. Sidi Omar was captured on 16 December, during Operation Compass by the 7th Hussars, 2nd Royal Tank Regiment (2nd RTR) and the 4th Royal Horse Artillery (4th RHA). After a bombardment, the British tanks charged the fort, one broke through the wall and after another tank drove through the hole, the garrison began to surrender. The Italians had concentrated their firepower on the east wall facing Egypt and had <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> an attack from the west. The fall of the fort left the way clear for the British to send reinforcements and supplies to the forces further north on the coast, free from the possibility of attack from the inland flank.|$|E

500|$|This {{decision}} provoked major opposition {{both from}} {{the people and the}} church, especially the Bishop of Rome, which Leo did not take into account. In the words of Warren Treadgold: [...] "He saw no need to consult the church, and he appears to have <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the depth of the popular opposition he encountered". The controversy weakened the Byzantine Empire, and was a key factor in the schism between the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Bishop of Rome.|$|E

500|$|According to Stefani, {{the various}} {{emotions}} she had {{experienced in the}} past year would be reflected on the album. The first songs written for the album had a sarcastic and humorous vibe, while she later described the other songs as having a [...] "realness" [...] to them. The first song written for the album was [...] "You Don't Know Me", a personal song penned with Rick Nowels. According to the singer, the song was [...] "the first opening of the channel" [...] of her songwriting inspiration. In the early stages, she also wrote a song with Linda Perry called [...] "Medicine Man" [...] while flying to No Doubt's Jazz Festival show in New Orleans. Another song, [...] "Red Flag", was the first song she wrote with J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels. She described it as a [...] "work of art" [...] for [...] "express so clearly what [...] was [...] at the time". They also worked on other songs, such as [...] "Naughty", [...] "Misery", which she considered a [...] "really happy song," [...] and [...] "Make Me Like You", produced by Mattman & Robin, which, having <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the result, she called [...] "so good"! ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first study}} showed infants a toy car that moved down an {{inclined}} track, disappeared behind a screen, and then reemerged {{at the other}} end, still on the track. The researchers created a [...] "possible event" [...] where a toy mouse was placed behind the tracks but was hidden by the screen as the car rolled by. Then, researchers created an [...] "impossible event." [...] In this situation, the toy mouse {{was placed on the}} tracks but was secretly removed after the screen was lowered so that the car seemed to go through the mouse. [...] Also in the 1991 study the researchers used an experiment involving two differently sized carrots (one tall and one short) in order to test the infants response when the carrots would be moved behind a short wall. [...] The wall was specifically designed to make the short carrot disappear, as well as tested the infants for habituation patterns on the disappearance of the tall carrot behind the wall (impossible event). Infants as young as 3½ months displayed greater stimulation toward the impossible event and much more habituation at the possible event. This indicated that they may have <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the impossible event, which suggested they remembered not only that the toy mouse still existed (object permanence) but also its location. The same was true of the tall carrot in the second experiment. [...] This research suggests that infants understand more about objects earlier than Piaget proposed.|$|E
500|$|When {{the teams}} reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, Hutton had been dropped, {{sparking}} much acrimony and {{controversy in the}} English cricket community. The reason {{was said to be}} Hutton's difficulties against Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. Observers noticed Hutton backing away, and the English selectors believed such a sight would {{have a negative effect on}} the rest of the side as it was a poor example from a key player. The Australians were pleased and believed the England selectors had erred, because they regarded Hutton as the hosts' best batsman. England batted first and Lindwall removed Hutton’s replacement as opener, George Emmett, who fended a short ball to Sid Barnes at short leg to leave England at 2/28. Emmett had <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> Lindwall's bouncer and took his eyes from the ball, fending with one hand on the bat, while ducking his head below his arms. The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett’s bat, rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect. In Australia’s match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who hesitantly parried it away for a single. Lindwall did not bounce Emmett again during the match, and O’Reilly surmised that the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent’s weakness against the short ball. O’Reilly concluded that Lindwall and Johnston [...] "had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort".|$|E
