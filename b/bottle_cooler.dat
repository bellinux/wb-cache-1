5000|$|A study {{conducted}} by engineering science students at Loyola College in Maryland suggested that the liquid content of aluminium bottles stays slightly colder than the liquid content of glass bottles when allowed to warm at room temperature. [...] These results were not corroborated by a 2005 study at Bucknell University, which found that “the fluid in the aluminium <b>bottle</b> <b>cools</b> much faster than the glass bottle, and once removed from a cold source and exposed to room temperature, the glass <b>bottle</b> remained <b>cooler</b> longer than the aluminium bottle.” [...] This conclusion {{is consistent with the}} fact that the bulk thermal conductivity of aluminium (237 W/(m·K)) is significantly higher than that of glass (1.1 W/(m·K)), as well as the fact that aluminium bottles are significantly thinner than glass. While the glass versus aluminium debate may make sense in connection with beer bottles, soft drinks are another matter. The majority of those bottles are currently plastic, while most beer bottles are glass.|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Southern African Solar Energy Conference, South Africa, 11 - 13 May, 2015. This work envisages {{on the development of}} an indoor solar simulator setup for operating PV panels and PV powered refrigeration appliances with a DC compressor. The use of DC powered devices helps in the elimination of inverters which aid reduction of cost and power loses. The solar simulator focuses on providing a test facility for a <b>bottle</b> <b>cooler</b> with a DC compressor solely powered from a PV panel of 125 W capacity. Halogen lamps are used in the simulator as they are inexpensive, readily available and their light intensity can be fully controlled by regulators. The lights in the solar simulator are arranged in a zig-zag pattern to obtain uniform illumination throughout the panel with minimum overlapping of light radiation. In order to perform various test conditions with respect to the light intensity, the distance between the simulator and the panel can be varied. The solar simulator is kept ON for a minimum of 30 minutes prior to the testing to obtain a steady state and uniform levels of irradiation. The compressor used in the <b>bottle</b> <b>cooler</b> is a DC powered Danfoss BD 35 K compressor which has an inbuilt control unit for smooth operation of the compressor during fluctuating solar irradiation and it works {{for a wide range of}} voltage of 10 to 45 V. The refrigerant used in the <b>bottle</b> <b>cooler</b> is iso-butane due to its low GWP and ODP values. An experimental comparison in the pull down characteristics of the DC powered <b>bottle</b> <b>cooler</b> and I-V characteristics of the PV panel used was performed using sun light and artificial solar simulator. In both cases, the <b>bottle</b> <b>cooler</b> unit is kept in the same environmental condition except for the PV panel that is kept in both conditions separately. The I-V characteristic experimentation was performed by applying load through a rheostat. Based on the I-V characteristics, the panel efficiency was found to be 9. 27 % under sunlight and 6. 93 % under the solar simulator setup. It is to be noted that the panel temperature was higher at outdoor conditions compared to that at indoor testing as fan cooling was provided during the test under the simulator. The average light intensity on the panel was lower at outdoor compared to indoor testing conditions. The pull down temperature was obtained by placing RTDs at various locations in the cabin and the average value was taken. The pull down time for the <b>bottle</b> <b>cooler</b> under the sunlight was 32. 78 minutes while it was 29. 5 minutes when tested under the solar simulator. Although the panel efficiency and the pull down time with the solar simulator is lower than the values observed from the open sun light, due to its consistency the simulator can be used as a test facility for PV powered DC appliances. cf 201...|$|E

40|$|Next-generation {{refrigerants}} {{with lower}} Global Warming Potentials than traditional HFC’s are being commercially introduced. Drop-in performance {{tests were conducted}} in a commercial bottle cooler/freezer. Tests were conducted with R 134 a as a baseline and several next-generation refrigerants and blends. The tests were conducted in accordance with ASHRAE Standard 72 at - 5. 6 °C and 3. 3 °C <b>bottle</b> <b>cooler</b> temperature setpoints. Two ambient conditions were tested, 23. 9 °C/ 55 % relative humidity and 26. 7 °C/ 55 % relative humidity. In addition to the ASHRAE test conditions, full pull-down and half pull-down tests were conducted in accordance with a soft-drink bottler’s specifications. Performance parameters such as discharge air temperatures, product simulator temperatures, suction pressure, discharge pressure, compressor mass flow rate, and compressor input power were measured and compared. With the exception of HFO 1234 ze(E), all the substitute refrigerants had similar performance as R 134 a. HFO 1234 ze(E) had lower density at compressor suction conditions and therefore resulted in longer compressor run times and longer pull-down times. A larger displacement compressor would likely bring HFO 1234 ze(E) to roughly the same performance as the other refrigerants...|$|E
40|$|Glass door merchandisers {{are used}} in grocery and {{convenience}} stores to display chilled beverages or refrigerated foods. Among other possible choices for this application, carbon dioxide (R 744, CO 2) {{is seen as a}} promising low-GWP refrigerant alternative that is non-flammable and non-toxic. While R 744 itself is less costly than synthetic alternatives, successful implementation of high-performance, low-cost transcritical R 744 technology is challenging. This paper summarizes important R 744 -specific design issues and differences in comparison to conventional R 134 a bottle coolers. Due to cost reasons, it is highly desired to use relatively conventional components, including round-tube-plate-fin heat exchanger designs, fixed geometry capillary tubes (instead of variable geometry expansion valves), and single-speed compressors. While a conventional round-tube-plate fin evaporator designs deliver acceptable results, transcritical R 744 systems require substantially different heat exchanger designs in order to deliver suitable performance when used as gas cooler. Internal heat exchange, which in conventional R 134 a systems is often achieved by wrapping the capillary tube around the compressor suction line, plays a much more important role in transcritical R 744 systems, and shows large optimization potential. Experiments also show that proper capillary tube sizing and refrigerant charge optimization have much bigger impact on transcritical R 744 systems in terms of cooling performance and energy efficiency in comparison to R 134 a systems. Presented {{is an example of a}} successful R 744 <b>bottle</b> <b>cooler</b> design that is on par with a comparable R 134 a system in terms of performance and cost.

25|$|Many plastic {{items for}} medical or {{laboratory}} use {{can be made}} from polypropylene because it can withstand the heat in an autoclave. Its heat resistance also enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade kettles. Food containers made from it will not melt in the dishwasher, and do not melt during industrial hot filling processes. For this reason, most plastic tubs for dairy products are polypropylene sealed with aluminum foil (both heat-resistant materials). After the product has cooled, the tubs are often given lids made of a less heat-resistant material, such as LDPE or polystyrene. Such containers provide a good hands-on example of the difference in modulus, since the rubbery (softer, more flexible) feeling of LDPE with respect to polypropylene of the same thickness is readily apparent. Rugged, translucent, reusable plastic containers made {{in a wide variety of}} shapes and sizes for consumers from various companies such as Rubbermaid and Sterilite are commonly made of polypropylene, although the lids are often made of somewhat more flexible LDPE so they can snap on to the container to close it. Polypropylene can also be made into disposable bottles to contain liquid, powdered, or similar consumer products, although HDPE and polyethylene terephthalate are commonly also used to make bottles. Plastic pails, car batteries, wastebaskets, pharmacy prescription <b>bottles,</b> <b>cooler</b> containers, dishes and pitchers are often made of polypropylene or HDPE, both of which commonly have rather similar appearance, feel, and properties at ambient temperature.|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{epidemiological}} {{studies have shown}} a strong link between air pollution and human morbidity and mortality. Combustion sources are most significant contributors to the urban air pollution. So far, toxicological research has focused predominantly on combustion generated particulate matter, thereby neglecting chemical complexity of combustion exhausts. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess toxic potential of ethylene combustion condensates, containing both particulate and gaseous combustion by-products, by means of a recombinant bacterial assay called the SWITCH (Salmonella Weighting of Induced Toxicity (Genotoxicity) and Cytotoxicity for Human Health) test. Thereby, the suitability of total organic carbon (TOC) as a parameter for toxicity assessment was also investigated. Ethylene was combusted in a low-pressure burner under controlled laboratory conditions by only varying the carbon/ oxygen ratio (C/O = 0. 63 – 0. 93). Ethylene combustion condensates were generated by drawing 10 l of combustion exhaust at constant flow rate (0. 4 l/min) and collecting it in condensated form in glass <b>bottles</b> <b>cooled</b> by liquid nitrogen. Genotoxic and cytotoxic potency of combustion condensates was analyzed with the SWITCH test, based on sequential measurements of luminescence, absorbance and fluorescence outputs of treated bacterial cultures. Our results show correlation between TOC content of combustion condensates and their genotoxicity/cytotoxicity. Moreover, combustion condensates of same TOC concentration exert the same toxic effect regardless of the used C/O ratios during their generation. Our results revealed that toxicologically relevant component(s) of the ethylene combustion exhausts is/are being produced during highly, mildly and non-sooting combustion conditions, only in different proportions. Thereby, total organic carbon proved to be a suitable parameter for the assessment of the toxicity of combustion condensates...|$|R
