5|$|Antioxidants {{are used}} as food {{additives}} to help guard against food deterioration. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping {{in the dark and}} sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. However, as oxygen is also important for plant respiration, storing plant materials in anaerobic conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors. Consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. Antioxidants are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike bacterial or fungal spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food. These preservatives include natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AA, E300) and tocopherols (E306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as propyl gallate (PG, E310), tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA, E320) and <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT, E321).|$|E

25|$|To {{minimize}} this problem, {{commercial samples}} of THF are often inhibited with <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT). THF {{should not be}} distilled to dryness, because the explosive peroxides concentrate in the residue.|$|E
25|$|The {{freezing}} process {{tends to}} degrade {{the taste of}} food and the meals are thus heavily processed with extra salt and fat to compensate. In addition, stabilizing the product {{for a long period}} typically means that companies will use partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for some items (typically dessert). Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are high in trans fats and are shown to adversely affect cardiovascular health. The dinners are almost always significantly less nutritious than fresh food and are formulated to remain edible after long periods of storage, thus often requiring preservatives such as <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene.</b> There is, however, some variability between brands.|$|E

5000|$|... p-Cresol {{is mainly}} {{consumed}} {{in the production of}} antioxidants, e.g., <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT). The monoalkylated derivatives undergo coupling to give an extensive family of diphenol antioxidants. These antioxidants are valued because they are relatively low in toxicity and nonstaining.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the cereal}} {{contains}} partially hydrogenated fats, it is marketed as trans-fat free since {{the amount of}} trans fat per serving {{is less than the}} threshold 0.5 grams/serving. The cereal also contains monoglycerides and diglycerides, used to bind saturated fat, and <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT), a preservative.|$|E
50|$|Manuel Rendon is a Venezuelan {{engineer}} {{who invented the}} first published formulation for the degradation of fossil-based high-density plastics. It is composed of heptane, cellulose, methyl rhenium trioxide, <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene,</b> and polyphenol oxidase. The additive can be selectively programmed to cause the plastic to begin disintegrating at a predetermined time.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the burgeoning}} {{interest}} in alternatives to fossil fuels, {{there has been}} renewed research interest in Botryococcus braunii. The DOE Joint Genome Institute is sequencing the DNA of Bb in 2009-2010. B. braunii is also the subject of research into the natural production of <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT), an antioxidant, food additive, and industrial chemical.|$|E

50|$|Since 1947, BHA {{has been}} added to edible fats and fat-containing foods for its {{antioxidant}} properties as it prevents rancidification of food which creates objectionable odors. Like <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT), the conjugated aromatic ring of BHA is able to stabilize free radicals, sequestering them. By acting as free radical scavengers, further free radical reactions are prevented.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{coriander}} {{essential oil}} in salami {{has been shown}} to increase the higher synthetic antioxidant effect of <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene,</b> which delays lipid oxidation and the rancid aroma and taste that come with it. Additionally, salami with coriander essential oil shows improvements in the sensory attributes of taste, odor, texture, brightness, and red colour intensity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT), {{also known}} as dibutylhydroxytoluene, is a {{lipophilic}} organic compound, chemically a derivative of phenol, that is useful for its antioxidant properties. European and U.S. regulations allow small amounts {{to be used as}} a food additive. In addition to this use, BHT is widely used to prevent oxidation in fluids (e.g. fuel, oil) and other materials where free radicals must be controlled.|$|E
50|$|Preservative food {{additives}} can be antimicrobial—which inhibit {{the growth of}} bacteria or fungi, including mold—or antioxidant, such as oxygen absorbers, which inhibit the oxidation of food constituents. Common antimicrobial preservatives include calcium propionate, sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, sulfites (sulfur dioxide, sodium bisulfite, potassium hydrogen sulfite, etc.), and EDTA. Antioxidants include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT). Other preservatives include formaldehyde (usually in solution), glutaraldehyde (insecticide), ethanol, and methylchloroisothiazolinone.|$|E
50|$|Ether is {{sensitive}} to light and air, tending to form explosive peroxides. Ether peroxides have a higher boiling point than ether and are contact explosives when dry. Commercial diethyl ether is typically supplied with trace amounts of the antioxidant <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT), which reduces the formation of peroxides. Storage over sodium hydroxide precipitates the intermediate ether hydroperoxides. Water and peroxides can be removed by either distillation from sodium and benzophenone, or by passing through a column of activated alumina.|$|E
50|$|Isobutylene {{is used as}} an {{intermediate}} {{in the production of}} a variety of products. It is reacted with methanol and ethanol in the manufacture of the gasoline oxygenates methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), respectively. Alkylation with butane produces isooctane, another fuel additive. Isobutylene is also used in the production of methacrolein. Polymerization of isobutylene produces butyl rubber (polyisobutylene). Antioxidants such as <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) are produced by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of phenols using isobutylene.|$|E
50|$|A 2015 {{article in}} Skeptical Inquirer details {{products}} Hari declares as having toxic ingredients while Hari promotes and receives sales commissions for products containing {{the same or}} similar ingredients. Hari's claims of toxicity have been dismissed by experts in science and medicine as incorrect or exaggerated. Hari in the past removed a product from her site when attention was drawn to it as containing chemicals she has spoken against, a body scrub called Fresh which contained <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT). However, Hari claims that BHT is not as toxic if applied to skin as opposed to ingested.|$|E

50|$|Antioxidants {{are often}} used as {{preservatives}} in fat-containing foods to delay the onset or slow the development of rancidity due to oxidation. Natural antioxidants include ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and tocopherols (vitamin E). Synthetic antioxidants include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT), TBHQ, propyl gallate and ethoxyquin. The natural antioxidants tend to be short-lived, so synthetic antioxidants are used when a longer shelf-life is preferred. The effectiveness of water-soluble antioxidants is limited in preventing direct oxidation within fats, but is valuable in intercepting free radicals that travel through the aqueous parts of foods. A combination of water-soluble and fat-soluble antioxidants is ideal, usually in the ratio of fat to water.|$|E
5000|$|Warmed-over flavor can be {{prevented}} {{by the addition of}} preservatives to processed meat. Many of the preservatives are antioxidants, ranging from tocopherols (related to vitamin E) to plum juice to industrial additives such as <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and propyl gallate. [...] Other preservatives such as sodium pyrophosphate and sodium hexametaphosphate may work by binding iron and preventing it from catalyzing the chemical reactions which lead to warmed-over flavor; as these compounds are generally more soluble in water than the fat-soluble antioxidant preservatives, they may be more readily used to prevent oxidative decomposition in meat. Nitrites, a curing agent for meat, may prevent the development of warmed-over flavor by preventing the release of iron during cooking.|$|E
50|$|Camphorsultam, or Oppolzer's sultam, is {{a typical}} chiral {{auxiliary}} in the asymmetric synthesis.In the total synthesis of manzacidin B, Ohfune group utilized camphorsultam to construct the core oxazoline ring asymmetrically. Comparing with oxazolidinone as the chiral auxiliary, camphorsultam had a significant (2S,3R)-selectivity.Camphorsultam also acts as a chiral auxiliary in Michael addition. Lithium base promoted stereoselective Michael addition of thiols to N-mcthacryloylcamphorsultam produced the corresponding addition products in high diastereoselectivity.Camphorsultam {{was used as a}} chiral auxiliary for the asymmetric Claisen rearrangement. In the presence of <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT) used as a polymerization inhibitor, a toluene solution of the adduct between geraniol and camphorsultam was heated in a sealed tube at 140 °C, to provide mainly the (2R,3S)-isomer as the major rearrangement product in 72% yield, securing the two contiguous stereocenters including the quaternary carbon.|$|E
50|$|This {{bacterium}} is an aquatic {{photosynthetic bacteria}} {{belonging to the}} phylum Cyanobacteria. They are composed of chained filaments known as trichomes that can show variation in morphology, varying from about 50-300 micrometers in length. These bacteria can also produce a thick walled, cylindrical, spore like structure known as akinetes, which also demonstrate variation in morphology. Some strains of this species are able to produce several toxins which affect humans: cylindrospermopsin, anatoxin-a and saxitoxin. This first toxin, cylindrospermopsin, {{has the ability to}} affect the liver and kidneys in humans as well as cause mild skin reactions upon exposure. The last two toxins, anatoxin-a and saxitoxin, are thought to be shellfish neurotoxins. Research has shown that C. raciborskii can naturally produce <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene,</b> an antioxidant, food additive, and industrial chemical.|$|E

5000|$|On February 5, 2015 Hari {{launched}} a petition on her website asking General Mills and Kellogg's {{to remove the}} preservative <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT) from their cereals. The additive has been widely used in cereal packaging in the U.S. for many years. BHT has to be listed as an ingredient on food labels, and some consumer-protection advocates like the Environmental Working Group have advised people to avoid it when possible. Cereals marketed in Europe by General Mills and Kellogg's do not contain the additive. Hari's petition received over 30,000 signatures in 24 hours. On February 5, 2015, General Mills released a statement that they are removing BHT from its cereal, stating, [...] "This change is not for safety reasons, but because we think consumers will embrace it. We've never spoken with Vani Hari {{and she did not}} play any role in our decision," [...] and [...] "...our removal of BHT from cereals is well underway and has been for more than a year." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, Walford began a {{commercial}} collaboration with fellow researchers Richard Weindruch and Kathleen Yankee Hall, {{and her husband}} William Hall, a wealthy businessman. In her tribute after his death, Kathleen Hall wrote of Walford, [...] "we both threw in {{a few thousand dollars}} and started a small business together." [...] Incorporated in California as Gerontix, the company was to sell supplements intended to improve health and increase life span. The first Gerontix product was <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxytoluene</b> (BHT), with lysine and zinc, which was sold in capsules and marketed as a treatment for herpes. Motivated by the success of the bestselling book Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach, by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw, the group intended to sell a package of products, called MaxiLife, which would capitalize on the release of Walford's book, Maximum Life Span. It was expected that Walford, a highly publicized researcher, would experience the same success as Pearson and Shaw. Before Walford's book was published and Gerontix started to manufacture its coordinated products, the manufacturer Twin Labs began to sell a single multi-ingredient supplement called MaxiLIFE. Despite the potential for trademark conflict, the Gerontix group elected to proceed with plans to use the name. Twin Labs brought suit against Gerontix for trademark infringement, which it won in 1984. Before the resolution of the lawsuit, the Gerontix MaxiLife products were brought to market and sold poorly, partly because of the lackluster sales of Walford's book. Lack of success in federal court and in health food stores led to the demise of Gerontix.|$|E
