5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{plans to}} go to his first sales call with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Dwight surprises Ryan by taking him to Dwight's beet farm to both teach and haze. When Ryan, a member of a {{fraternity}} in college, accuses him of trying to haze him into acceptance, Dwight snaps at him, saying the reason Ryan has yet to make a sale is <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> he knows everything, and must think otherwise to sell. After Dwight tries to force Ryan to wrestle his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), Ryan gets angry and walks out. Dwight apologizes to Ryan and begins to give Ryan serious sales advice as Ryan takes notes. The two then go on a sales call which ultimately doesn't work out for Ryan. Irritated, Ryan throws eggs at the building housing the company that refused his sale. Dwight and Ryan then go to a bar and return to the office, where it appears they formed a new bond.|$|E

25|$|On {{the way to}} {{the heart}} of the Island, Jack's group {{encounters}} the Man in Black's group. Jack tells the Man in Black that he is going to kill him, and together with Desmond, they travel {{to the heart of the}} Island. Jack believes that Desmond can kill the Man in Black <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> Jacob brought him back not as bait but as a weapon. Desmond tells Jack that destroying the island and killing the Man in Black do not matter because he is going down to the heart of the island and leaving for another place. Jack and the Man in Black lower Desmond down to the heart of the island and he reaches a chamber, leading to a glowing pool with an elongated stone at its center. Immune to the pool's electromagnetic energy, Desmond manages to remove the giant stone stopper in the center of the pool. However, the light goes out and the pool dries up, setting about the destruction of the island which the Man in Black predicted. A result of Desmond's act is an unforeseen side-effect of making the Man in Black mortal again. During a prolonged fight, the Man in Black stabs Jack in the same spot where his appendix was taken out and almost kills him when Kate shoots the Man in Black in the back, allowing Jack to kick him off the cliff to his death. The island continues to crumble and Jack realizes that he has to restore the light of the heart of the Island. He tells Kate to get Claire Littleton (Emilie De Ravin) on the plane and leave the island in case he fails. The two profess their love for each other and Kate leaves with Sawyer while Hurley and Ben follow Jack back to the pool.|$|E

500|$|Frusciante's guitar playing employs {{emphasis}} on appropriate melody, tone, and structure rather than virtuosity. Although virtuoso influences {{can be heard}} throughout his career, {{he has said that}} he often minimizes this. He feels that in general, guitar mastery has not evolved much since the 1960s and considers the greatest players of that decade unsurpassed. When he was growing up in the 1980s, many mainstream guitarists focused on speed. Because of this, he thinks that the skills of many defiant new wave and punk guitarists were largely overlooked. Therefore, he accentuates the melodically-driven technique of players such as Matthew Ashman of Bow Wow Wow and Bernard Sumner of Joy Division as much as possible <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> that their style has been overlooked and consequently underexplored. Despite this, he considers himself a fan of technique-driven guitarists like Randy Rhoads and Steve Vai, but represses an urge to emulate their style: [...] "People believe that by playing faster and creating new playing techniques you can progress forward, but then they realize that emotionally they don't progress at all. They transmit nothing to the people listening and they stay at where Hendrix was three decades ago. Something like that happened to Vai in the 80s." [...] Believing that focusing only on [...] "clean tones" [...] is negative, Frusciante developed an interest in playing with what he calls a [...] "grimy" [...] sound. As a result, he considers it beneficial to [...] "mistreat" [...] his guitar and employ various forms of distortion when soloing. He also tries to break as many [...] "stylistic boundaries" [...] as he can to expand his musical horizons. He thinks that much of the output from today's guitarists is unoriginal, and that many of his contemporaries [...] "follow the rules with no risk".|$|E
500|$|Frusciante's {{approach}} to album composition has changed. On his early recordings, he welcomed sonic imperfections, noting that [...] "even on [...] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars." [...] However, on later albums such as Shadows Collide With People, he pursued the opposite: [...] "I just wanted {{everything to be}} perfect—I didn't want anything off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that." [...] Frusciante views songwriting as taking time, and does not force it: [...] "If a song wants to come to me, I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it." [...] Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar. He also prefers to record his albums on analog tapes and other relatively primitive equipment. This preference stems from his belief that older equipment can actually speed up the recording process, and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency. Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> [...] "music comes alive when [...] are creating it fast". He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often get frustrated or bogged down by perfectionism. With his focus on new styles of music, Frusciante describes having worked with the computer as an instrument, and having found the ability to merge old and new production techniques together. He has noted {{that there has been}} a change in how he works on an album. In the past he would work on one song at a time, but with the new [...] "Progressive Synth Pop" [...] that he has been working on, he feels much more comfortable to work within the album as a whole. He currently uses the music tracker Renoise as his main Digital audio workstation along with some drum machines, sequencers, and other hardware, along with his Doepfer, Arp, and other modular synthesizers.|$|E

Kavli has also noted his intent that the Prizes distinguish themselves from the Nobel prizes in science. Consequently, one key distinction between the prizes: Kavli Prize laureates are selected by committees composed of distinguished international scientists. These committee members are recommended by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the French Academy of Sciences, the Max Planck Society, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and The Royal Society, with committee chairs chosen by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.|$|E

2500|$|He had {{an ongoing}} rivalry with Ambassador to Japan Edwin O. Reischauer and {{frequently}} withheld key {{information from the}} embassy. Reischauer favored Kennedy administration plans to give the island more autonomy and allow the Japanese government to provide the island with greater financial aid; Caraway opposed all such measures, believing that they would eventually strip the United States {{of one of its}} most strategic bases. Resichauer referred to Caraway as a [...] "bull-headed man" [...] and [...] "autocratic" [...] in his memoirs, with Caraway firing back that [...] "he's useless. He's a menace, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> he knows everything... and he knows nothing." [...] Caraway {{went so far as to}} accuse Resichauer of entering into a [...] "conspiracy with the Japanese" [...] to force American forces off the Ryukyus. In 1962, President of the United States John F. Kennedy began an effort to give the residents of the Ryukyu islands. One of his methods was to restrict Caraway's power of veto by allowing him to overrule the Ryukyu Legislature only when necessary to protect the security interests of the United States.|$|E
2500|$|As with season one, {{the writing}} team {{came up with}} more [...] "what if" [...] episodes for the series, like season two's [...] "Visitor", which came from the idea of, [...] "what if someone showed up and Clark began {{to believe that he}} wasn't the last person from his planet." [...] In the case of [...] "Nocturne", [...] "what if Clark had been brought up by {{different}} parents?" [...] With [...] "Nocturne", the episode is meant to be [...] "an extreme version of the Clark story". As Gough explains, [...] "Here's a kid with a condition, whose parents literally lock him in the basement. It's an extreme parenting episode—contrasting how these parents deal with Byron, and how the Kents deal with Clark." [...] The episode also dealt with Clark's fallibility, in the fact that Clark is only a teenager, and he does not always have all of the facts; just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> he is doing the right thing {{does not necessarily mean that}} he is. In this case, Clark believes that he is saving Byron from his abusive parents. Gough clarifies, [...] "'s doing what he thinks is right, but ultimately unleashes the kid, and [...] causes damage. Just because you have the power and you think you're right doesn't always mean you're taking the right course of action." [...] Another [...] "what if" [...] episode was [...] "Witness", which originally came from the concept, [...] "what if Clark witnessed a crime and had to testify in court as to why he was standing in the middle of the road at 2 o'clock in the morning?" [...] In the end, the court angle was dropped from the storyline, with Clark making an anonymous phone call to the Sheriff and eventually having to battle the three kryptonite powered thieves that he had witnessed stealing.|$|E
