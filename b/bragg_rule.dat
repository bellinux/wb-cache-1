40|$|A {{modified}} local plasma {{model is}} established. The Gordon-Kim's molecular charged density model is employed {{to obtain a}} formula to evaluate the stopping power of many useful molecular systems. The stopping power of H 2 and He gas was calculated for incident proton energy ranging from 100 keV to 2. 5 MeV. The stopping power of O 2, N 2, and water vapor was also calculated for incident proton energy ranging from 40 keV. to 2. 5 MeV. Good agreement with experimental data was obtained. A discussion of molecular effects leading to department from <b>Bragg's</b> <b>rule</b> is presented.

40|$|We have {{conducted}} a quantum-mechanical analysis within the independent elec- tron model to investigate electron removal {{processes in the}} proton-methane collision system in the 20 keV to a few MeV energy range. Similar to a previous work, {{we have used a}} spectral representation of the molecular Hamiltonian and a single-centre expansion of the initially populated molecular orbitals. The two-centre basis gen- erator method is then used to solve the time-dependent single-particle Schr ̈odinger equations. We have also used the “independent atom model” in which we have treated the collision system with a molecular target as a combination of collision systems with atomic targets. We have also shown that <b>Bragg’s</b> additivity <b>rule</b> is derived from the independent atom model. The results for net capture and ionization cross sections, obtained by the molec- ular method as well as <b>Bragg’s</b> additivity <b>rule,</b> are compared with available ex- perimental studies. We observe good agreement at high energies for both models. At intermediate and lower energies the situation seems to be less clear. For the molecular method the ionization results are improved when we estimate excitation particularly at intermediate energies. Overall, our molecular method outperforms <b>Bragg’s</b> additivity <b>rule</b> for both capture and ionization...|$|R

Proton stopping cross sections for gases and vapors were {{measured in the}} energy range 30 to 600 kev. A beam of protons was passed through a chamber with thin aluminum end walls containing the gas or vapor to be measured. The energy of the beam was measured before and after passing through the chamber and with and without the gas in the beam {{in order to measure}} the energy loss in the foils and in the gas. The beam was accelerated by an electrostatic generator, and the beam energies measured by an electrostatic analyzer and magnetic spectrometer. The substances measured were air, H[subscript 2], He, N[subscript 2], O[subscript 2], Ne, A, Kr, Xe, H[subscript 2]O, CO[subscript 2], CH[subscript 4], C[subscript 2]H[subscript 2], C[subscript 2]H[subscript 4], C[subscript 6]H[subscript 6], NH[subscript 3], NO, and N[subscript 2]O. <b>Bragg's</b> <b>rule</b> was tested by comparison of NH[subscript 3] with N[subscript 2]/ 2 + 3 H[subscript 2]/ 2, NO with N[subscript 2]/ 2 + O[subscript 2]/ 2 etc., for H[subscript 2]O, NH[subscript 3], NO, and N[subscript 2]O, and found to be valid above 150 kev, except for NO. On the assumption of <b>Bragg's</b> <b>rule,</b> the stopping cross section of carbon was calculated from the data on the hydrocarbons, CO[subscript 2], and oxygen and hydrogen. The results were consistent for energies above 100 kev.

40|$|We use the {{dielectric}} formalism {{to evaluate the}} electronic energy loss of swift H and He ions in SiC and TiC targets, {{as a function of}} the projectile energy. The electronic properties of these materials are described by the MELF-GOS model, where the excitation of outer electrons is characterized by a linear combination of Mermin-type energy-loss functions (ELF), whereas the contribution due to the target inner-shell ionizations is included through hydrogenic generalized oscillator strengths (GOS). In this scheme, the differences between the energy loss of the projectile in the compound clearly differ from that calculated from its elemental component when applying <b>Bragg’s</b> additivity <b>rule,</b> which assumes that the energy loss in each species is unaffected by the state of aggregation. Our calculations show that the results provided by <b>Bragg’s</b> additivity <b>rule</b> fails near and below the stopping power maximum due to aggregation effects, which affect mainly the outer electrons excitation spectrum. We obtain that aggregation effects in the energy loss are more important for H projectiles in TiC targets. A good agreement with available experimental data is obtained. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{stopping}} {{cross section}} of H 2, He, O 2, air, N 2, Ne, A, Kr, Xe, H 2 O, NH 3, NO, N 2 O, CH 4, C 2 H 2, C 2 H 4, and C 6 H 6 for protons has been measured over the energy range Ep= 30 - 600 kev. An electrostatic analyzer measures the energy of protons incident on a gas cell, and the transmitted beam energy is measured with a magnetic spectrometer. The gas cell is closed off with thin aluminum windows. Comparison of the molecular {{stopping cross section}} of the compounds with the values obtained by summing the constituent atomic cross sections shows that <b>Bragg's</b> <b>rule</b> does not hold for any of these compounds below Ep= 150 kev; for NO the additive rule does not hold at any energy studied. Above 150 kev the stopping cross section of carbon is obtained by subtracting the hydrogen contribution from the values measured for the hydrocarbons. Average ionization potentials are calculated from these measurements. A range energy relation for protons in air is included. Sources of error are discussed; the probable error of the stopping cross section measurements varies between 2 - 4 percent...|$|R
40|$|The high-charge-and energy (HZE) {{transport}} {{computer program}} HZETRN is developed {{to address the}} problems of free-space radiation transport and shielding. The HZETRN program is intended specifically for the design engineer who is interested in obtaining fast and accurate dosimetric information for the design and construction of space modules and devices. The program is based on a one-dimensional space-marching formulation of the Boltzmann transport equation with a straight-ahead approximation. The effect of the long-range Coulomb force and electron interaction is treated as a continuous slowing-down process. Atomic (electronic) stopping power coefficients with energies above a few A MeV are calculated by using Bethe's theory including <b>Bragg's</b> <b>rule,</b> Ziegler's shell corrections, and effective charge. Nuclear absorption cross sections are obtained from fits to quantum calculations and total cross sections are obtained with a Ramsauer formalism. Nuclear fragmentation cross sections are calculated with a semiempirical abrasion-ablation fragmentation model. The relation of the final computer code to the Boltzmann equation is discussed in the context of simplifying assumptions. A detailed description of the flow of the computer code, input requirements, sample output, and compatibility requirements for non-VAX platforms are provided...|$|R
40|$|Stopping powers for Vyns (vinyl {{chloride}} {{vinyl acetate}} copolymer) were measured both for 4 He ions in the rnage 200 - 3000 keV and for 1 H ions {{in the range}} 550 - 1750 keV using the transmission technique. A detector model {{is used for the}} energy calibration to improve the accuracy of the stopping power curve for 4 He ions in the low energy region. The estimated uncertainty in the stopping power values is ca. 1. 5 % for 4 He ions and ca. 2 % for 1 H ions. A comparison is made between a parametrization of the present data and several parametrizations of the stopping power found in the literature. The stopping power values closest to the present experimental data for 4 H ions are obtained by adding elemental stopping powers using <b>Bragg's</b> <b>rule.</b> for this the experimental values for the C 1 stopping power reported earlier should be used. The charge state scaling, sometimes used to take account for phase-state effects, is not appropriate for Vyns. For 1 H ions, the parametrization closest to our data is that of Janni from 1982. JRC.
