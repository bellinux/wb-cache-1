The cruiser, whose call sign was [...] "Thunder," [...] had arrived in the Gulf of Tonkin the previous day after setting out from Norfolk on 13 April. Two other warships that would participate in the mission cruised nearby, the USS Providence and USS Oklahoma City. At around 02:00 on 10 May, the Newport Newss commanding officer, Captain Walter F. Zartman, ordered the formation into a line abreast, Hanson to the far left, then the Providence, Newport News, Oklahoma City, and Buchanan. The USS Myles C. Fox was ordered farther to the northeast to act as a <b>blocking</b> <b>element</b> in case of enemy patrol-boat activity and to cover the rear of the formation when it would eventually turn to the west and onto a firing course. At 03:45, all five warships turned to the firing course of 240T, roughly parallel to the longitudinal axis of the Cat Bi airfield. At the extreme range of Newport Newss 8-inch guns, the Cat Bi military complex was the raid's primary target. The completely darkened warships together commenced firing at 03:47. Seventy-seven of the Newport Newss massive 8-inch shells slammed into the military installations around Cat Bi, while hundreds of rounds from the 6-inch guns of the two light cruisers and 5-inch guns of the cruisers and two destroyers pounded enemy targets on the Do Son Peninsula. When shore batteries opened up, effective cruiser-destroyer counter-battery fire silenced them. Less than thirty minutes later, the action was over. Enemy fire had been somewhat more sporadic than the day before, and none of the ships was hit. Quite possibly the overwhelming fire from the cruisers and destroyers caused most of the North Vietnamese gunners to run for cover, {{and by the time they}} re-manned their positions, the task group was retiring. Still, the enemy had fired numerous 152-mm shells at the column of ships as they steamed past in the darkness, and the sailors in all the ships felt the shells' explosions.|$|E

D Company operated out of Fire Support Base Hawk Hill in an area of I Corps. They were located south and southwest of Danang providing security for local villages and conducting regular searches for NVA units. The territory they patrolled stretched from the coastal lowlands to the mountains and jungle. North Vietnamese and Viet Cong activity was common in the area, and D Company suffered regular casualties from snipers and booby traps. On the morning of Jan. 17, 1970, Sloat's squad was conducting a patrol, serving as a <b>blocking</b> <b>element</b> in support of tanks and armored personnel carriers from F Troop in the Que Son valley. As the squad moved through dense up a small hill in file formation, the lead Soldier tripped a wire attached to a hand grenade booby-trap, set up by enemy forces. When the grenade rolled down the hill toward Sloat, he had a choice. He could hit the ground and seek cover, or pick up the grenade and throw it away from his fellow Soldiers. After initially attempting to throw the grenade, Sloat realized that detonation was imminent, and that two or three men near him would be killed or seriously injured if he couldn't shield them from the blast. In an instant, Sloat chose to draw the grenade to his body, shielding his squad members from the blast, and saving their lives. Sloat's actions define the ultimate sacrifice of laying down his own life in order to save the lives of his comrades. Specialist Four Donald P.

Here we describe the identification and characterization of two separable enhancer blocking elements located in the 5 ′ flanking region of the chicken α-globin domain, 11 – 16 kb upstream of the embryonic α-type π gene in a DNA fragment harboring a MAR (matrix attachment region) element and three DNase I hypersensitive sites (HSs). The most upstream enhancer <b>blocking</b> <b>element</b> co-localizes with the MAR element and an erythroid-specific HS.

The 11 zinc-finger CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which plays an essential role in enhancer blocking activity in many previously characterized vertebrate insulators, is found to bind the two α-globin enhancer blocking elements.

The proposed check valve design with a hollow ball as a <b>blocking</b> <b>element</b> {{has a number of}} substantial advantages compared with the most widely spread valves with disc type flaps used as blocking elements. The advantages are valve operation independent of functioning of other safety systems and absence of friction pairs. The need to conduct experimental studies is determined both by the novelty of the proposed check valve design and by absence of verified computational validation methods for functioning of this type of valves. In this connection, the paper presents a computational validation method for hydrodynamic parameters of the proposed check valve design and similitude parameters describing hydrodynamic characteristics of the check valve – numeric values of the similitude parameters were obtained through calculations made by the ANSYSCFX commercial hydrodynamic code. The paper describes the experimental model of the check valve with two alternative options for the <b>blocking</b> <b>element</b> – one {{in the form of a}} hollow ball in a support bowl; and another one, in the form of a semi sphere on a guide rod going through the support sleeve on the valve spindle.

We previously used a stable transfection colony assay to identify an enhancer-blocking element, <b>blocking</b> <b>element</b> alpha/delta- 1 (BEAD- 1), between the TCR δ and α gene segments of the human TCR α/δ locus. We hypothesized that enhancer-blocking by BEAD- 1 might be required to prevent the TCR δ enhancer from activating TCR α gene segment transcription and rearrangement at the double negative stage of thymocyte development. Here, we used a transfection approach to define partial enhancer-blocking activity in an analogous position of the murine TCR α/δ locus. To test the functional significance of this activity in vivo, we used gene targeting to delete the region from the endogenous locus. We found no perturbation of TCR δ and TCR α gene expression and rearrangement on targeted alleles, indicating that enhancer-blocking activity in this region {{is not required to}} maintain the developmentally distinct activation profiles of the two genes. We suggest that appropriate regulation may be achieved as a result of intrinsic biases in enhancer–promoter interactions or a developmental stage specificity to promoter function that is distinct from any additional specificity imposed by the enhancers themselves...|$|E

Information on pressure patterns is highly desirable for improving performance, condition monitoring and accurate prediction of the remaining life of systems that operate in extremely high temperature environments, such as gas turbine engines. A number of technologies have been recently investigated, however these technologies target specific applications and they are limited by the maximum operating temperature. Thick and thin films of SiCN can withstand high temperatures. SiCN is a polymer-derived ceramic with liquid phase polymer as its starting material. This provides the advantage {{that it can be}} molded to any shape. CERASET™ also yields itself for photolithography, with the addition of photo initiator 2, 2 -Dimethoxy- 2 -phenyl-acetophenone (DMPA), thereby enabling photolithographical patterning of the pre-ceramic polymer using UV lithography. SiCN fabrication includes thermosetting, crosslinking and pyrolysis. The technology is still under investigation for stability and improved performance. This work presents the preparation of SiCN films to be used as the body of a sensor for pressure measurements in high temperature environments. The sensor employs the phenomenon of drag effect. The pressure sensor consists of a slender sensitive element and a thick <b>blocking</b> <b>element.</b> The dimensions and thickness of the films depend on the intended application of the sensors.

40|$|Very large, two-dimensional, {{anisotropic}} arrays {{have been}} proposed to improve ultrasound image quality. Due to noncontiguous acoustic windows into the body, however, {{a significant portion of}} such an aperture may be <b>blocked.</b> <b>Blocked</b> <b>elements</b> result in high sidelobes in the point spread function, degrading image quality. To compensate for this, an object dependent method using multiple receive beams has been recently proposed. This method is effective in removing undesired sidelobes. However, previous results were for one-dimensional arrays where only lateral beams were used for estimation. With two-dimensional arrays, the distribution of <b>blocked</b> <b>elements</b> can change beam characteristics, both laterally and elevationally. In other words, receive beams must be formed in both directions for better performance. Although straightforward in principle, extension of the algorithm from one dimension to two increases computational complexity dramatically. Furthermore, the restricted elevational steering capability of anisotropic arrays also limits performance. In this paper, several computationally efficient algorithms for two-dimensional <b>blocked</b> <b>element</b> compensation are proposed and evaluated. It is shown that undesired sidelobes can be effectively removed using {{only a limited number of}} receive beams. Image quality can therefore be restored in the presence of <b>blocked</b> <b>elements</b> without significantly increasing hardware complexity...|$|R

Coordinate transcription {{of the five}} genes begins after meiotic maturation of the oocyte, continues through cleavage, and reaches its maximum at morula stage, after which these genes are shut off and maintained in a silenced state for {{the life cycle of}} the animal. Although cis regulative sequences affecting the timing and the level of expression of these genes have been characterized, much less is known about the mechanism of their repression. Here we report the results of a functional analysis that allowed the identification of the sequence elements needed for the silencing of the a-H 2 A gene at gastrula stage. We found that important negative regulative sequences are located in the 462 bp sns 5 fragment located in the 30 region. Remarkably, sns 5 contains the sns enhancer <b>blocking</b> <b>element</b> and the most 30 H 2 A codons. In addition, we made the striking observation that inhibition of the anti-enhancer activity of sns, by titration of the binding proteins in microinjected embryos, also affected the capability of sns 5 to down-regulate transgene expression at gastrula stage. A further sequence element essential for repression of the H 2 A gene was identified upstream of the enhancer, in the 50 region, and contains four GAGA repeats. Altogether these findings suggest that downregulation of the a-H 2 A gene occurs by the functional interaction of the 50 and 30 cis sequence elements. These results demonstrate the involvement of a genomic insulator in the silencing of gene expression...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{distance}} relays have integrated numerous protection functions including power-swing blocking and out-of-step or pole-slip tripping functions. The {{main purpose}} of the power-swing blocking function is to differentiate faults from power swings and block distance or other relay elements from operating during stable or unstable power swings. Most power-swing blocking elements are based on traditional methods that monitor {{the rate of change}} of the positivesequence impedance. The required settings for the power-swing blocking elements could be difficult to calculate in many applications, particularly those where fast swings can be expected. For these cases, extensive stability studies are necessary to determine the fastest rate of possible power swings. This paper describes a zero-setting power-swing blocking protection method that is independent of network parameters and is based on monitoring the line swing-center voltage rate of change. The new method does not require any stability studies or user settings for the proper blocking of relay elements that are prone to operate during stable or unstable power swings. The method is applicable to long, heavily loaded transmission lines that pose great problems in the application of power-swing blocking elements based on traditional methods. This new method offers a great advantage in its ability to detect three-phase faults that may occur during power swings and allows the protective relays to issue a tripping command and isolate the faulted power system element. In this paper, we discuss other enhancements in the design of power-swing blocking and out-of-step tripping functions that improve the security and reliability of the power system. We also demonstrate the behavior and performance of the new power-swing <b>blocking</b> <b>element</b> through use of electromagnetic transient program (EMTP) and relay simulations...|$|E

The antenna, notstudied here, is a linearly polarized antenna operating at 1 GHz with abandwidth of 30 %. The thesis is split into two parts: a radar cross sectionreduction part for 2 - 16 GHz and a low-pass filter design to make the radometransparent at the antenna operating frequency and polarization. In the first partwe design and compare shape optimization with a radar absorber as twomethods for radar cross section reduction. For an optimized Jaumann absorberdesign we achieved a 5 dB reduction of the two-dimensional mono-static radarcross section over 68 % of the frequency band {{as compared with the}} originalmetallic wing and for the polarization of the electric field is parallel to the wingaxis. It was observed during the design process that Jaumann absorber keeps itsmajor feature when it is applied to circular and elliptical surfaces; however, aresonant frequency shift occurs for elliptical structure due to varying thicknessof the elliptical Jaumann layers. It is shown that the Jaumann absorber has abetter performance for radar cross section reduction than shape optimizedscreen for the above mentioned polarization. Furthermore, by using theJaumann absorber design we leave more space for antenna inside the wing. The second part of the thesis is concerned with the transparency of theradome. It is required that the antenna enclosed by the radome can radiatethrough it. We propose a design where the main <b>blocking</b> <b>element</b> in theJaumann absorber, the metal back sheet, has been replaced with a frequencyselective surface. The frequency selective surface should be almost totallytransparent over the antenna frequency band and conversely, it must be almosttotally reflective over the remaining frequency band for the Jaumann absorberto function efficiently.

An optimizationis done for the FSS backed Jaumann absorber to achieve a desirableperformance. The new FSS back Jaumann absorber design not only provides apartial transparency for the radome but it also shows an improvement in radarcross section compare with ordinary Jaumann absorber.
