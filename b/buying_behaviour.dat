40|$|MBA thesisThis {{research}} set out {{to provide}} recommendations and insights to wealth management organisations that wish to develop a strategy that targets the gay market in South Africa. To achieve this end, the research identified the primary <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours</b> of affluent gay men living in Gauteng, and the key success factors that wealth management organisations should consider when designing and implementing specific strategies for the gay market in South Africa. The strategic success factors were critiqued {{to ensure that they}} addressed the identified <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours</b> or take advantage of the <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours</b> for maximum impact. A qualitative research methodology was employed with data being collected from the three population samples using in-depth interviews. The three sampled populations were: Affluent gay males living in Gauteng, wealth managers from leading wealth management organisations in South Africa, and South African media strategists. The data obtained from the interviews was analysed and triangulated in order to identify the said <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours</b> and key success factors. The research results show that affluent, South African gay men living in Gauteng possess very similar <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours</b> to those identified in the literature. The research did, however, uncover several unique <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours</b> as depicted by this market segment in the context of wealth management, including: gay individuals in South Africa are confident consumers with a high social status; gay individuals possess unique wealth management needs; the gay community will boycott homophobic or discriminatory companies or brands, and the gay community will actively seek out companies and brands that specifically target them. Regarding the key success factors for targeting the gay market in South Africa, the research results deviated considerably from the literature with many of the proposed key considerations being unique to this research. The unique success factors identified in this research are as follows: relevant festivals and events iii should be the preferred marketing mediums when targeting the affluent gay market in South Africa; there is merit in wealth management organisations having a dedicated team or individual actively involved in the gay community; wealth management organisations should embark on a brave and aggressive strategy, given the unchartered nature of the gay market in South Africa; a strategy for South Africa’s gay market should, ideally, be reserved for wealth management organisations with established and credible brands, and the strategy for South Africa’s gay market should take into account the strong social networks at play within the gay community. There was a good deal of consistency and overlap between the identified <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours</b> and the proposed strategic success factors. It is felt that this consistency added considerable value to the recommendations for wealth management organisations on how best to develop and implement a strategy for South Africa’s gay market. There has been very little research into the gay market in South Africa, and no research into how best to approach this gay market from the wealth management point of view. Using the recommendations proposed in this research, wealth management organisations can begin to tap into this lucrative, appealing, and previously ignored market segment...|$|R
40|$|With the {{financial}} crisis, {{it becomes more}} and more difficult and expensive to obtain funding for infrastructure projects. Public sector procurement is undergoing major changes. Drastic cuts in government budgets re-ignited the debate of centralisation versus decentralisation that was last debated after the oil crisis of 1973. In the traditional marketing and purchasing literature, the relationship between Buyer and Seller has long been at the centre of the purchase interaction. Organisations have chosen close long-term relationships instead of “playing the market” in the name of cost reduction and increased revenues. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify the particular constraints on relationship building in the public sector, and to assess whether or not these constraints make standard efficient management practices inapplicable to the public sector. Several organisations from the Irish public sector were interviewed about their relationships. The qualitative data collected from the interviews were combined with the current related literature of business to business relationships, public procurement and organisational <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours.</b> It is argued in this research that it is extremely difficult to establish a collaborative relationship with suppliers when mandatory rules and procedures create formal and centralised <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours.</b> In conclusion, lessons for developing collaborative arrangements in public procurement are identified...|$|R

50|$|An {{analytic}} {{approach is}} a much more research and data based approach, where two sets of information are derived and used to segment the market. The two approaches give the business an idea for the future profitability of a segment, and the tendencies and behaviours it portrays. The first approach gives them an idea on the future growth of the segment, and whether its investment outcome is worthwhile. This, therefore, will usually be done in advance. The second approach is more based around the observation of the <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours</b> of the segment and is more based around primary research.|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{substantial}} researches investigating {{the effects of}} corporate social responsibility (CSR) on corporate financial performance and long-term economic well-being. However, relatively little of researches or {{studies have been conducted}} based on the correlation of CSR and consumer behaviours, especially in developing countries or emerging markets. In this regard, this study addresses certain issues examining the effects of CSR on Chinese consumers’ <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours</b> in the industry of dairy by using a quantitative research method. Based on prior academic literatures in this field and attitude-behaviour theoretical framework, this paper postulates that CSR influence consumers’ attitudes, evaluation and identification towards a CSR brand. At the same time, customer’s attitudes of CSR brands, as their affective states of mind, will also influence their subsequent purchase behaviours (e. g., purchase intentions, loyalty intentions, word-of-mouth) regarding firms with CSR practices. 161 valid questionnaires were collected online and data in this case was analysed by using SPSS. Results of this research find that CSR has a significant effect on increasing customers’ emotions and evaluations towards CSR brands. But the effects of it on consumers’ behavioural intentions are more complicated than expectation. In addition, the study provides empirical evidence to support the link between customers’ knowledge of CSR and their <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours</b> towards CSR dairy corporations in the context of China. This paper was finally concluded by discussing the implications of these findings for managers and further research...|$|R

Although consumption-related emotions {{have been studied}} with increasing frequency in consumer behaviour, issues concerning the evaluation of emotions leading to impulse purchasing and airport environment effect remain hidden in academic context. Airport shoppers tend to make impulse purchases, however, previous studies relating to impulse purchases {{did not have the}} shopper as an independent variable. This research paper presents conceptual and empirical evidence that airport shoppers’ self-assessment (judgement) about the appropriateness of engaging in impulse shopping behaviour moderates the relationship between the airport influences on impulse shopping and consumers’ <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The study found that the relationship between airport impulsive shopping and the related shopping behaviour is significant only when airport shoppers believe that acting on impulse is appropriate. This finding supports the proposition for moderating airport shoppers’ self-evaluations...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we outline an overall {{approach}} for tracking service and relationship quality that differs substantially from the conventional paradigm. The conventional attitude-based approach relies on {{assumptions about the}} link between evaluations of service quality and subsequent behaviour which are {{not supported by the}} substantive body of research findings about buyer behaviour. The attitude-based approach also requires inferences to be made concerning what aspects of service provision determine the attitudes. Unfortunately the traditional approach is still widely practiced in commercial market research, as well as practised and taught in Universities. We therefore now explain a different approach which looks directly at service provision by using descriptive non-attitudinal measures and seeks to relate these to observed <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours</b> of interest. The approach has been trialled across a number of service categories and markets with promising results...|$|R

Segmenting makes it possible to target marketing measures at the most profitable shoppers.The value of segmenting shoppers is debated in the shopper marketing industry. For retailers it can provide direction on positioning relative to competitors as well as in terms of store locations. Loyalty cards can provide one of the richest sources of segmentation data. For consumer product manufacturers, shopper segmentation is less useful, at least in physical stores, as the shelf and displays communicate to all store shoppers in the same way.|$|E

5000|$|Low {{involvement}} consumers {{take on the}} habitual <b>buying</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{or variety}} seeking behaviour. These processes occur when a consumer is purchasing fast moving goods and requires a low product involvement level. Habitual behaviour occurs when the consumer doesn’t see large differences between brands; so therefore don’t search for information. Consumers usually purchase {{on the basis of}} advertising or promotion creating familiarity. The attitudes formed by being exposed to advertisements and promotions are what can cause brand loyalty to occur [...] The limited amount of information processing and lack of cognitive work done to assess each brand can mean that these consumers stick with a brand simply because it is less work. Low involvement consumers are using short-cut evaluations so a known brand name that they haven’t thought deep enough to find faults in will be an easy buy-decision for them. Habitual <b>buying</b> <b>behaviour</b> can result in brand loyalty subconsciously. The consumer isn’t actively aware they want to purchase repeatedly from a particular brand, it is just in their habitual nature to do so. Alternatively, low involvement consumers who are using variety seeking behaviour see differences between brands and tend {{to do a lot of}} switching. To attempt to persuade these consumers into habitual <b>buying</b> <b>behaviour,</b> marketers will try to dominate shelf space, cut prices or introduce new products. If a low involvement consumer continues to use variety-seeking behaviour, brand loyalty is unlikely to be established.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of QLIF subproject 1 was to deliver in-depth analyses of consumer expectations, attitudes and <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours,</b> {{with respect to}} quality and safety of foods from organic and low-input production systems. Results of the research showed that consumer attitudes towards quality and safety are not consistent - they are changeable, and linked to a whole bundle of assorted issues such as personal health, the natural environment, and ethics. Organic consumers appear to fall into two main types: regular and occasional purchasers. Regular consumers are committed insofar as the products satisfy their quality and safety requirements, but they are suspicious of over-processed organic foods sold in supermarkets. Occasional consumers of organic and low-input foods are more price and convenience sensitive. A key finding is that consumer behaviour has co-evolved with market development. Availability has constituted the main barrier to increasing demand, and limited assortment {{as well as the}} perceived relationship between quality and price account for much of the fluctuation in demand among occasional users...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Impulsivity is a core {{feature in}} {{patients}} with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim {{of the study is}} to investigate how a specific dimension of impulsivity, namely urgency (the tendency to act rashly when distressed), might shed new light on the aetiology of compulsive buying proneness {{in patients with}} TBI and to explore how urgency and compulsive buying relate to the burden perceived by the caregivers. SAMPLING AND METHODS: Caregivers of 74 patients with TBI were given 3 questionnaires in order to assess their subjective burden as well as patients' impulsivity and compulsive buying proneness. RESULTS: Both urgency and compulsive buying tendencies significantly increased after TBI. Furthermore, path analyses revealed that current urgency was both directly and indirectly related to the subjective burden perceived by the caregivers, and this indirect pathway was mediated by compulsive buying. CONCLUSION: Urgency plays a central role in understanding specific problematic behaviours after TBI and their impact on caregivers. These findings are discussed in light of the cognitive processes underlying the urgency component of impulsivity in relation to the occurrence of compulsive <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours</b> after TBI...|$|R
50|$|High VS Low Involvement ConsumersBuying {{decisions}} {{from consumers}} can {{be dependent on}} their level of involvement with the product or brand. Brand loyalty can stem from whether the consumer is highly or lowly involved with the brand. High involvement consumers interact with brands and products {{that are important to}} them, are risky or expensive and products that people who are important to the consumer have strong opinions on. High Involvement consumers will usually progress through complex <b>buying</b> <b>behaviour</b> to decide whether they want to purchase a product whose brand greatly differs from others. This involves gaining knowledge of the product, specifications and attributes, and furthermore creating attitudes that lead to the buyer’s decision. Similarly, dissonance-reducing <b>buying</b> <b>behaviour</b> occurs in the same situation, but instead with brands they see little differences between. This process consists of consumers finding purchase convenience, attractive pricing, and shopping around. High involvement consumers search for more product attributes and engage in more product related activities, such as searching for more information on a product and researching the brands background. This engagement makes consumers aware and knowledgeable of the brands attributes, so therefore they can shape behavioural brand loyalty, as the consumer feels that they know the brand well.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study consumers' <b>buying</b> <b>behaviours</b> towards {{certified}} eco-friendly food and to estimate their willingness to buy this food. It also examines the role of the retailer to replace the certification and to add value by analysing the consumer's 'willingness to switch store' in order to purchase a certified product. Results indicate that consumers' intentions to purchase eco-certified food depend on the level of awareness about production conditions, the eco-mark experience and credence attribute associations, occupation and household income. Therefore, the eco-mark and the most preferred retailer could add value for customers. A methodological insight is that when the consumer's decisions for eco-friendly products are analysed, the distinction of eco-mark representations in three different attribute associations improves the explaining capacity of the consumer's decision model. eco-marks; eco-marking; store switching; certified businesses; purchasing intentions; eco-certification; consumers; buying behaviour; eco-marked products; eco-friendly food; retail industry; retailing; food industry; customer occupations; household incomes; most preferred retailers; added value; decision making; attribute associations; willingness to purchase; ecology; ecological awareness; environmental management; environment; eco-labelling; fruit farming; agriculture; Greece; economics; business research. ...|$|R
