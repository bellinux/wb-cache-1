5|$|By this time, the 4th Destroyer Flotilla had <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> {{destroyed}} as {{a fighting}} unit. The few remaining, heavily damaged ships had been scattered and would take no further {{part in the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|Castile Curtain – {{the curtain}} wall linking St. James and St. Peter & Paul Bastions. Its parapet has <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> {{dismantled}} {{to make way}} for the road leading from Floriana to Valletta.|$|E
50|$|The music <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{in form of}} a {{background}} score and <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> used to enhance the various moods and scenes within the film.|$|R
50|$|The Scotto family's palace <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> {{destroyed}} {{during the}} Second World War {{and the garden}} grew ever more degraded until 2008 when it <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> reconstructed and refitted.|$|R
50|$|The {{constituency}} <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> rural, {{and particularly}} the coastal areas around the city of Vaasa <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> Swedish-speaking. The largest party in the 2007 election was the Centre Party.|$|R
5|$|Cobalt-60 has a {{radioactive}} half-life of 5.27years. The loss of potency requires periodic {{replacement of the}} source in radiotherapy and {{is one reason why}} cobalt machines have <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> replaced by linear accelerators in modern radiation therapy.|$|E
5|$|Greek {{historian}} Herodotus {{claimed that}} ancient Egyptians {{looked like the}} people in Colchis (modern-day Georgia). This claim has <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> discredited as fictional by modern-day scholars.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecosystem}} {{that developed}} in the caldera after the 1815 eruption has <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> uninfluenced by human beings because of its isolation.|$|E
50|$|The Krüper's nuthatch, a rare nuthatch, <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{restricted}} to forests of Turkish pine and depends heavily {{on it for}} feeding; the ranges of the two species <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> coincident.|$|R
50|$|Family law <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{a matter}} of custom, however {{customary}} family practices <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> supplemented and superseded by the Marriage Act of 1980, placing marriage largely within the jurisdiction of courts.|$|R
50|$|Such {{theories}} were proposed before tectonic theory <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> understood, {{and therefore}} <b>are</b> now <b>largely</b> discredited.|$|R
5|$|The {{legend has}} now <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> forgotten, {{and there have}} been no {{reported}} sightings of the ghost in recent times.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Curtis as Charlie Bratley, the 13-year-old son of Officer Lou Bratley and {{his ex-wife}} Terri. Having <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> ignored by his negligent mother, {{at the end}} of the film he is sent to live with Lou.|$|E
5|$|For unknown reasons, Ruisdael {{almost entirely}} stopped dating his work from 1653. Only five {{works from the}} 1660s have a, {{partially}} obscured, year next to his signature; none from the 1670s and 1680s have a date. Dating subsequent work has therefore <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> based on detective work and speculation.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: One of Darrach's more {{prominent}} designs. The {{current design of}} the Elgin County Courthouse <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> due to {{his work in the}} late 19th century after the building <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> destroyed by fire ...|$|R
50|$|Wayne Enterprises and the Wayne Foundation <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> run by Bruce Wayne's {{business}} manager Lucius Fox. Fox makes most company decisions on Bruce Wayne's behalf, since Wayne's time <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> occupied as the vigilante Batman.|$|R
50|$|The west of {{the borough}} <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> flat in nature, {{dominated}} by the River Sence flood plain. This area of the borough <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> rural, consisting {{of a number of}} very small villages and hamlets.|$|R
5|$|In 1991, it was {{estimated}} that 159 resident and 23 migratory species were endangered or vulnerable due to forest clearance, illegal logging, hunting and habitat degradation, especially in the lowlands. The species most affected are large water birds whose wetland habitat has <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> lost to agriculture, and forest species, as deforestation for agriculture and logging have removed and degraded portions of the woodlands.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, many {{scholars}} believed that Hammurabi was Amraphel, the King of Shinar in the Book of Genesis 14:1. This view has now <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> rejected, and Amraphael's existence is not attested in any writings from outside the Bible.|$|E
5|$|Ivanović painted {{very little}} in her final years, and {{is said to have}} <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> {{forgotten}} in Serbia by the 1870s.

5000|$|The {{light of}} the inner portion of the solar corona <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> inherent, whereas the {{light of the}} outer portion <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{reflected}} sunlight, as proven at the Sumatra eclipse by means of spectroscopic and polariscopic observations.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} thought that {{through most of}} Earth's history, oceans <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> oxygen-deficient. During the Archean, euxinia <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> absent because of low {{availability}} of sulfate in the oceans, but during the Proterozoic, it would become more common.|$|R

It {{serves as the}} continuation of Highway 139 (WIS139) from Wisconsin into Michigan, connecting to US Highway 2 (US2) in Iron River. M-189 has <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> unchanged since being designated in the 1930s, although a new bridge over the Brule River at the state line was built in 1988.|$|E
5|$|On May 22, villagers {{returned}} to Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan, which had <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> destroyed. Expecting another attack, reinforcements from the Carmeli Brigade took up {{positions in the}} two villages. Many of the participants of the battles were sent to Tiberias to rest and recuperate, and the units that lost soldiers were reorganized.|$|E
5|$|Super Typhoon Pamela was {{not only}} a wet {{tropical}} cyclone for the island of Guam, but a destructive one as well. Since Pamela, wooden structures across Guam have <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> replaced by concrete structures in order to better weather typhoons.|$|E
50|$|The land {{being used}} <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{marshland}} and reclaimed from the sea: in particular, it <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> unoccupied. As a result, {{the social and}} fiscal costs of development are less than are usual for Chinese urban and industrial development.|$|R
50|$|Orchestration {{is often}} {{discussed}} {{as having an}} inherent intelligence or even implicitly autonomic control, but those <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> aspirations or analogies rather than technical descriptions. In reality, orchestration <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> the effect of automation or systems deploying elements of control theory.|$|R
50|$|Until 1947, {{the second}} track <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> {{dismantled}} for reparations to the Soviet Union, but it <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> restored from Halle to Sangerhausen by 1954. In 1965, the line near Berga-Kelbra was relocated {{for the new}} Kelbra Dam on the Helme.|$|R
5|$|Taman Sari {{consisted}} of four distinct areas: a large artificial lake with islands and pavilions {{located in the}} west, a bathing complex in the centre, a complex of pavilions and pools in the south, and a smaller lake in the east.

In the years following his victory at Strasbourg, Julian was able to repair and garrison the Rhine forts and impose tributary status on the Germanic tribes beyond the border.|$|E
50|$|The {{museum has}} a wide and varied events {{programme}} that changes every year. Events <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> family-focussed, with some events aimed at an older adult audience. Because of the family-focus, events <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> centred on bank holiday weekends and school holidays.|$|R
