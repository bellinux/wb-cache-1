5|$|The {{security}} forces {{set up a}} JOC at Mangula at 09:30 on 19 January with 1 Commando present. A tracking team led by Lieutenant Nigel Henson first made contact around noon on 21 January, when concealed ZIPRA cadres from Gang 2 fired upon them with an RPD machine-gun and AK-47 and SKS rifles. Henson's men withdrew and 1 Commando set up stop points around the contact area to contain the guerrillas during the day; night-ambush positions were then set up as darkness fell. The RLI moved up again at dawn {{the next day and}} met the insurgents at 07:30, when a stick of five 1 Commando men led by Lieutenant Bruce Snelgar was sighted in an area of thick bush by three guerrillas from Gang 2. The cadres caught Snelgar's stick by surprise, opening fire with a heavy burst of RPD bullets. Snelgar and Trooper McMaster were wounded and Trooper Anthony <b>Brading</b> was shot dead. In the battle which ensued all three ZIPRA fighters were killed with no further loss to the RLI.|$|E

50|$|On Sunday, <b>Brade</b> reads through Ralph's {{research}} notebooks {{and realizes}} that Ralph's data had been faked, a cardinal sin in chemistry.

5000|$|Frommer's {{said of the}} town: [...] "Overall, you'll get {{the sense}} of a small {{community}} galvanized into new forms of self-reliance and cooperation, with lots of emphasis on somewhat gritty business-related visits from construction crews and British and international relief agencies". <b>Brades</b> contains several small shops, a bank, a branch of the Royal Bank of Canada on the <b>Brades</b> Main Road, government offices, a post office, a library, and a pharmacy. Runaway Travel, the largest and most comprehensive travel agency on Montserrat is based in <b>Brades.</b> The firm Gas Grant Enterprises and Trading has its offices in <b>Brades,</b> as does Montserrat Airways and the Montserrat Tourist Board. The Attorney-General's Chambers are situated at 3 Farara Plaza in <b>Brades.</b> Eateries of note in the area include Soca Cabana, a beach shack on Little Bay which sells chicken and fish dishes with live reggae music on Friday nights, and Tina's on <b>Brades</b> Main Road which serves lobster burgers, garlic shrimp, coconut cream pie and ginger beer.|$|R

The only person who could have overheard was Cap Anson. <b>Brade</b> accuses Anson of killing Ralph to prevent him from publishing the faked data (but does not mention the attempt on his own life). Anson denies the murder, but Doheny then tricks Anson into revealing that he knows about the attempt on <b>Brade's</b> life.

5000|$|The {{founder of}} the company, William Hunt, was an edge tool maker at Rowley Regis, near Dudley, Worcestershire, in the late 18th century. In 1782 he {{purchased}} the <b>Brades</b> Estate at Oldbury, near Birmingham, and established a new works there known as <b>Brades</b> Forge, or simply as The <b>Brades.</b> By 1805 they were also manufacturing steel on the site, which was {{now known as the}} <b>Brades</b> Steel Works. Around 1793, Hunt took W. Cliffe into partnership, and for a short period the firm was known as Hunt and Cliffe: this name appears in the company's first ledger, dated 9 May 1794. This partnership dissolved around 1803, and Hunt continued trading on his own account until 1809, when he took his sons into partnership and the firm became known as William Hunt & Sons.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Brading</b> {{joined the}} Royal Naval Air Service on 12 June 1917, {{just a month}} past his eighteenth birthday. He trained in an {{operational}} squadron, 12 Naval, before being posted to 1 Naval in April 1918 as a Sopwith Camel pilot. On 2 May, he scored his first aerial victory when a squadron patrol caught a luckless German reconnaissance plane north of Albert and <b>Brading,</b> Samuel Kinkead, Hazel Wallace, and four other pilots sent it down out of control for a win apiece. On the 15th, <b>Brading</b> gained a second victory in similar fashion, teaming with Kinkead, Wallace, Charles Dawson Booker, Robert McLaughlin, Maxwell Findlay, James Henry Forman, and two other pilots to destroy an Albatros D.V to add to all their scores. <b>Brading</b> also received a second victory that day, for his solo win in driving a second Albatros D.V down out of control. His fourth triumph came on 9 June, when he drove a DFW reconnaissance plane down out of control. On 28 June, he became an ace by driving down another Albatros D.V. From there on, Brading's wins were always over the best German fighter planes, Fokker D.VIIs and a Pfalz D.XII. The only curiosity among them was the last pilot downed plummeted to his death {{in one of the}} pioneering uses of a parachute; that was on 16 September 1918.|$|E
