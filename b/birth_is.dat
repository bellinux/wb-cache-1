40|$|Children’s Experiences {{after the}} Unintended Birth of a Sibling 2 This study {{examined}} whether {{children with a}} younger sibling whose <b>birth</b> <b>was</b> unintended experience larger declines {{in the quality of}} their home environment and larger increases in behavioral problems than children whose younger sibling’s <b>birth</b> <b>was</b> intended. We use data from the NLSY 79, which involved approximately 1500 children who experienced a sibling’s birth. We estimate crosslag regression models to assess changes in the home environment and children’s behavioral problems after the birth of a sibling (intended or unintended). Results were consistent with our hypotheses, such that compared to boys and girls whose sibling’s <b>birth</b> <b>was</b> intended, children whose sibling’s <b>birth</b> <b>was</b> unintended experienced larger declines in the quality of their home environment, and boys had larger increases in behavioral problems. These associations were limited to children whose sibling’s <b>birth</b> <b>was</b> mistimed, and were not observed for children whose younger sibling’s <b>birth</b> <b>was</b> unwanted. The effects of unintended childbearing, and of mistimed births particularly, on siblings are discussed. Children’s Experiences after the Unintended Birth of a Sibling...|$|R

5|$|Born William fitzHerbert in York, William {{was the son}} of Herbert of Winchester, or Herbert fitzAlberic, {{chancellor}} and {{treasurer of}} King Henry I. Most sources say his mother was Emma, half-sister of King Stephen and Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, and that she was an illegitimate daughter of Stephen II, Count of Blois, Stephen's father. New research, however, suggests that Emma might have been a daughter of Hunger fitzOdin, who held lands in Dorset in the Domesday survey.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Multiple <b>births</b> <b>are</b> an {{important}} subgroup {{to consider in}} trials aimed at reducing preterm birth or its consequences. Including multiples results in a unique mixture of independent and clustered data, which has implications for the design, analysis and reporting of the trial. We aimed to determine how multiple <b>births</b> <b>were</b> {{taken into account in}} the design and analysis of recent trials involving preterm infants, and whether key information relevant to multiple <b>births</b> <b>was</b> reported. DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review of multicentre randomised trials involving preterm infants published between 2008 and 2013. Information relevant to multiple <b>births</b> <b>was</b> extracted. RESULTS: Of the 56 trials included in the review, 6 (11 %) excluded multiples and 24 (43 %) failed to indicate whether multiples were included. Among the 26 trials that reported multiples were included, only one (4 %) accounted for clustering in the sample size calculations and eight (31 %) took the clustering into account in the analysis of the primary outcome. Of the 20 trials that randomised infants, 12 (60 %) failed to report how infants from the same <b>birth</b> <b>were</b> randomised. CONCLUSIONS: Information on multiple <b>births</b> <b>is</b> often poorly reported in trials involving preterm infants, and clustering due to multiple <b>births</b> <b>is</b> rarely taken into account. Since ignoring clustering could result in inappropriate recommendations for clinical practice, clustering should be taken into account in the design and analysis of future neonatal and perinatal trials including infants from a multiple birth.
