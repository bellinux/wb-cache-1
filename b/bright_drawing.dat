So that’s kind of what it’s about, but it’s a really tempo-driven song as well, so it’s kind of a bit of a juxtaposition as far as the story content and the music … It sounds rockin’, but it has a positive message." [...] - Carrie Underwood on the inspiration behind the song. [...] The song was written by Underwood with frequent collaborators Chris DeStefano and Hillary Lindsey, and was produced by Mark <b>Bright.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on country and rock influences in its composition, [...] "Little Toy Guns" [...] features a [...] "heavy and orchestral" [...] arrangement with emotionally resonant lyrics and an [...] "uplifting" [...] melody. Critics have also called the song a prequel of sorts to her 2012 hit [...] "Blown Away" [...] for the songs' similar thematic content and [...] "stormy" [...] sonic aesthetic.Lyrically, the song tells a story of domestic violence revolving around a young child overhearing her parents fighting and wanting to escape from the pain. Underwood narrates the chorus from the child's perspective, stating that she wishes the angry words were fake [...] "like little toy guns" [...] so they wouldn't hurt.|$|E

40|$|In the 1980 s, rural {{settlements}} in the Northeast of Thailand were farming focused, and strategies of living were structured around the need to secure subsistence {{in the face of}} a capricious environment and a weak developmental state. More than half of households in the region lived below the poverty line, and the immediate prospects for 'development' were not <b>bright.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on a 25 -year longitudinal study of two villages in Mahasarakham, the paper describes and reflects on how risk and vulnerability have been re-shaped during a quarter of a century of profound economic and social change.

40|$|A {{technique}} for measuring temperature {{close to the}} primary cutting edge in turning has been developed. The cutting temperatures of a 0. 16 percent carbon <b>bright</b> <b>drawn</b> mild steel, have been measured {{for a range of}} cutting speeds and feedrates at a constant depth of cut. Tool nose radius was also varied. The correlations for the workpiece temperature of cutting speed and feedrate have been developed. The results show that the temperature correlates well with cutting speed and feedrate but the nose radius has little effect. Cutting forces were measured by a dynamometer and these were used to find the non zero forces at zero feedrate. These farces have been related to the deformation of the work material near the cutting edge of the tool and a method for calculating the cutting temperatures from these has been proposed...|$|R

50|$|Long-exposure, time-exposure, or slow-shutter {{photography}} involves using a long-duration {{shutter speed}} to sharply capture the stationary elements of images while blurring, smearing, or obscuring the moving elements.
