A seamless intermixing of the vector and threaded control mechanisms allows a VT architecture to flexibly and compactly encode application parallelism and locality.

The Scale VT architecture is an instantiation of the vector-thread paradigm designed for low-power and high-performance embedded systems. Scale includes a scalar RISC control processor and a four-lane vector-thread unit that can execute 16 operations per cycle and supports up to 128 simultaneously active virtual processor threads. Scale provides unit-stride and strided-segment vector loads and stores, and it implements cache refill/access decoupling. The Scale memory system includes a four-port, non-blocking, 32 -way set-associative, 32 KB cache. A prototype Scale VT processor was implemented in 180 nm technology using an ASIC-style design flow. The chip has 7. 1 million transistors and a core area of 16. 6 mm 2, and it runs at 260 MHz while consuming 0. 4 - 1. 1 W. This thesis evaluates Scale using a diverse selection of embedded benchmarks, including example kernels for image processing, audio processing, text and data processing, cryptography, network processing, and wireless communication. (cont.) Larger applications also include a JPEG image encoder and an IEEE 802. 11 la wireless transmitter. Scale achieves high performance on a range of different types of codes, generally executing 3 - 11 compute operations per cycle. Unlike other architectures which improve performance at the expense of increased energy consumption, Scale is generally even more energy efficient than a scalar RISC processor. by Ronny Meir Krashinsky.

However, new methods are needed to meet the complex demands of high performance, embedded systems. This research explores new storage management techniques for this focused but critical application. These techniques include memory design exploration based on the application retargeting technique, storage-based systolic <b>instruction</b> <b>broadcast,</b> and systolic virtual memory to improve both the performance and efficiency of embedded SIMD systems. For an efficient storage usage by memory design space exploration in embedded SIMD systems, an analysis method for assessing storage needs and costs of a given application automatically retargeted across a spectrum of storage configuration designs was developed. Using this technique, a SIMD processing element achieves optimal area and energy efficiency with a register file containing between 8 and 12 words for given workload. This configuration is between 15 % and 25 % more area and energy efficient than other memory configurations being considered. Systolic <b>instruction</b> <b>broadcast</b> is a high performance and area efficient instruction broadcasting scheme with short-wire interconnects by eliminating of wire latency bottleneck found in global <b>instruction</b> <b>broadcast.</b> Three implementation methods are defined and evaluated - software method, 2 -write port register file method, and bypass method. In our evaluations, due to the system's short clock cycle time and scheduler, a speedup in system performance of up to 7. 5 {{can be achieved by}} the year 2010. In addition, speedup of area efficiency also can be achieved up to 7. 2 for a given workload. The ability of minimizing off-chip memory access latency while maximizing access frequency by scheduling techniques along with data prefetch techniques in systolic virtual memory mechanism was evaluated using our SIMD-systolic architecture simulator. Results show that, systolic virtual off-chip memory with shared address space can achieve over 50 % higher area efficiency than that of an on-chip only system for a matrix multiplication application.

40|$|While {{the clock}} speed of general purpose (uni-) {{processors}} has risen dramatically during recent years, {{this is not}} true for SIMD (Single Instruction stream Multiple Data streams) parallel processors. The reason {{is to be found in}} the structure of this type of architecture: long-range broadcasting of data, clock and control signals. Also, as syn- chronization in the architecture has traditionally been done using broadcasting of a global clock, clock skew has been one limiting factor to the clock speed. The advent of deep-submicron VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technology, where interconnect delay dominates over gate delay, further emphasizes the importance of resolving this "broadcasting bottleneck" problem, since broadcasting normally implies the distribu- tion of signals using long resistive (high delay) wires. As a solution, this thesis presents and evaluates new principles for the organization of SIMD architectures, using a two-level hierarchical organization of the control path. A global Control Unit (CU) <b>broadcasts</b> <b>instructions</b> to all Processing Elements (PEs) in the array at the word-level. These instructions are then executed by local CUs (one in each PE) at the bit-level. An up-shift in clock frequency from the global CU (low speed) to the local CUs (high speed) is thus used, relieving the global CU from broad- casting the high fan-out control signals at high speed. Not only does this scheme enable the use of a high PE clock frequency, it also cre- ates the possibility for greater local freedom at the PE level, enabling very efficient "bit-level pipelined" instructions. These instructions permit various types of "global operations", e. g. data broadcasting, inner product calculations and minimum/maxi- mum searches, all done with very low latency. Introducing hierarchical control in SIMD architectures, also enables locally gener- ated phase-locked PE clocks to be used. This approach has the potential of offering a low (array size independent) clock skew between adjacent PEs. The simulation results of one such implementation ("connected ringoscillators") are presented and discussed. The REMAP-. gamma. SIMD architecture, using the hierarchical control organization, is presented and discussed. Basic matrix calculations (e. g. matrix by vector multiplication), which form the most basic parts in signal processing algorithms, are mapped and their performance discussed on the REMAP-. gamma. architecture. Also shown is how some frequently used sig- nal processing algorithms are performed: convolutions, FIR filtering and Discrete Fou- rier Transform. Two application domains in which the REMAP-. gamma. architecture may be used are pre- sented and evaluated: 1) Artificial Neural Networks, and 2) Phased array multi-channel radar signal processing.

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{instruction}} scheduling logic {{is one of}} the most critical components of modern superscalar microprocessors, both from the delay and power dissipation standpoints. The delay and energy requirement of driving the result tags across the associatively-addressed issue queue accounts for a significant percentage of the scheduler’s overhead and also limits the design scalability. We propose two schemes to reduce the power consumption and the delays of the wakeup logic. Our first scheme – instruction packing – shares the associative part of an issue queue entry between two instructions, each with at most one non-ready source. As a result, the number of entries in the issue queue (and, hence, the length of the tag buses) can be reduced by a factor of two with almost no impact on the IPCs, because most instructions either enter the pipeline with at least one of their source operands ready, or do not make use of two source registers to begin with. Our second scheme – tag memoization – avoids driving the upper portion of the tags, if those bits did not change their values from what was driven on the same tag bus during the most recent <b>broadcast.</b> While <b>instruction</b> packing results in the reduced length of the tag buses, tag memoization reduced the number of tag lines that need to be driven. We evaluate our designs using detailed microarchitectural simulations of the SPEC 2000 benchmarks and the SPICE simulations of the issue queue layouts. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{instruction}} {{window is}} a critical component and a major energy consumer in out-of-order superscalar processors. An important source of energy consumption in the instruction window is the instruction wakeup: a completing <b>instruction</b> <b>broadcasts</b> its result register tag and an associative comparison is performed with all the entries in the window. This paper shows that a very large fraction of the completing instructions have to wake up {{no more than a}} single instruction currently in the window. Consequently, we propose to save energy by using indexing to only enable the comparator at the single instruction to wake up. Only in the rare case when more than one instruction needs to wake up, our scheme reverts to enabling all the comparators or a subset of them. For this reason, we call our scheme Hybrid. Overall, our scheme is very effective: for a processor with a 96 -entry window, the number of comparisons performed by the average completing instruction with a destination register is reduced to 0. 8. The exact magnitude of the energy savings will depend on the specific instruction window implementation. Furthermore, the application suffers no performance penalty...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Modern {{processors}} {{rely heavily}} on broadcast networks to bypass instruction results todependent instructions in the pipeline. However, as architectures get wider and pipelines get deeper, broadcasting becomes more complex, slower, {{and more difficult to}} implement. This complexity is compounded by shrinking feature size, as the communication speed decreases relative to transistor switching speeds. This paper examines the fundamentalsneeds of bypass networks and proposes a method for classifying these Inter-ALU Networks based on how operands are routed from producers to consumers. We then propose and eval-uate at both the circuit and architectural level a fine grain point-to-point Routed Inter-ALU Network (RIAN) that delivers the same instruction throughput as a full bypass network butat higher speeds and using fewer wires. 1 Introduction The most critical loop in pipelined processors enables data dependent instructions to execute in consecutivecycles. In fact, the ALU execution delay plus the bypass latency to deliver the ALU output back to its input often sets the cycle time of the machine. As shown in prior research [16, 3], increasing this path by even a singlecycle dramatically reduces instruction throughput rates. Most modern processors, including both superscalar and VLIW architectures, use some form of <b>broadcast</b> to deliver <b>instruction</b> results to all places that a consumerinstruction could reside...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores a new {{approach}} to building data-parallel accelerators that is based on simplifying the instruction set, microarchitecture, and programming methodology for a vector-thread architecture. The thesis begins by categorizing regular and irregular data-level parallelism (DLP), before presenting several architectural design patterns for data-parallel accelerators including the multiple-instruction multiple-data (MIMD) pattern, the vector single-instruction multiple-data (vector-SIMD) pattern, the single-instruction multiple-thread (SIMT) pattern, and the vector-thread (VT) pattern. Our recently proposed VT pattern includes many control threads that each manage their own array of microthreads. The control thread uses vector memory instructions to efficiently move data and vector fetch <b>instructions</b> to <b>broadcast</b> scalar <b>instructions</b> to all microthreads. These vector mechanisms are complemented by the ability for each microthread to direct its own control flow. In this thesis, I introduce various techniques for building simplified instances of the VT pattern. I propose unifying the VT control-thread and microthread scalar instruction sets to simplify the microarchitecture and programming methodology. I propose a new single-lane VT microarchitecture based on minimal changes to the vector-SIMD pattern. (cont.) Single-lane cores are simpler to implement than multi-lane cores and can achieve similar energy efficiency. This new microarchitecture uses control processor embedding to mitigate the area overhead of single-lane cores, and uses vector fragments to more efficiently handle both regular and irregular DLP as compared to previous VT architectures. I also propose an explicitly data-parallel VT programming methodology that is based on a slightly modified scalar compiler. This methodology is easier to use than assembly programming, yet simpler to implement than an automatically vectorizing compiler. To evaluate these ideas, we have begun implementing the Maven data-parallel accelerator. This thesis compares a simplified Maven VT core to MIMD, vector-SIMD, and SIMT cores. We have implemented these cores with an ASIC methodology, and I use the resulting gate-level models to evaluate the area, performance, and energy of several compiled microbenchmarks. This work is the first detailed quantitative comparison of the VT pattern to other patterns. My results suggest that future data-parallel accelerators based on simplified VT architectures should be able to combine the energy efficiency of vector-SIMD accelerators with the flexibility of MIMD accelerators. by Christopher Francis Batten.
