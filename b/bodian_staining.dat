40|$|The {{stainability}} {{of neural}} elements is determined during the {{various stages of}} tissue preparation which precede impregnation. The hypothesis (Romanes, 1950) that variations in the physiological state of the neurones {{at the time of}} fixation might influence the stain was examined. Feeding and anaesthesia did not influence the staining of gastric nerve fibres under the conditions of the experiments. A study was made of fixing fluids for <b>Bodian</b> <b>staining.</b> A picric-acetic-alcohol mixture and alcoholic Bouin were convenient and effective, each being superior to formaldehyde-acetic-alcohol. For overnight fixation formaldehyde solution neutral-ized with calcium carbonate was satisfactory, but where prolonged fixation is per-missible formaldehyde neutralized with excess of magnesium carbonate gave superior results. Attention was drawn to the probability that the final stain could be improved by 'pretreatment ' of mounted sections before silvering. Dewaxed sections were treated individually with 27 substances from a variety of chemical groups to determine the effects on subsequent <b>Bodian</b> <b>staining.</b> Nitric and sulphuric acids, formaldehyde solution neutralized with magnesium carbonate, methyl alcohol, and perhaps sodium carbonate contribute in different ways towards better preparations. In particular pretreatment with nitric acid suppresses the background stain, especially in smooth muscle; sulphuric acid increases the number of fine nerve fibres displayed, and methyl alcohol facilitates the staining (in formaldehyde-fixed tissues) of nerve fibres that are otherwise difficult to demonstrate, such as those in the renal cortex, which are almost certainly post-ganglionic sympathetic fibres...|$|E
40|$|Special {{staining}} {{plays an}} important role in the clinical neuropathological diagnosis. Some special staining is used to distinguish the specific structure of neuron, such as Nissl staining for Nissl body. It can distinguish neuron from other cells, and can be used to judge the degree of neuron injury. Some special staining is used as the assistance of pathological diagnosis of some nervous system diseases. For example, in the primary demyelinating disease, Luxol Fast Blue staining is used to mark the demyelinating region; <b>Bodian</b> <b>staining</b> is used to label the relatively preserved axon; Holzer staining can show the abundant fine processes of reactively proliferative astrocytes, and so on. It will get twice the result with half the effort if pathologists use special staining as the assistance of clinical neuropathological diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{adhesion}} molecule 1 (CADM 1), an immunoglobulin superfamily member, is expressed on superior cervical ganglion neurites and mediates cell–cell adhesion by trans-homophilic binding. In {{addition to the}} membrane-bound form, we have previously shown that a soluble form (sCADM 1) generated by alternative splicing possesses a stop codon immediately downstream of the immunoglobulin-like domain. Here, we demonstrate the presence of sCADM 1 in vivo and its possible role in neurite extension. sCADM 1 {{appears to be a}} stromal protein because extracellular-restricted, but not intracellular-restricted, anti-CADM 1 antibody stained stromal protein-rich extract from mouse brains. Murine plasmacytoma cells, P 3 U 1, were modified to secrete sCADM 1 fused with either immunoglobulin (Ig) G Fc portion (sCADM 1 -Fc) or its deletion form that lacks the immunoglobulin-like domain (ΔsCADM 1 -Fc). When P 3 U 1 derivatives expressing sCADM 1 -Fc or ΔsCADM 1 -Fc were implanted into collagen gels, Fc-fused proteins were present more abundantly around the cells. Superior cervical ganglion neurons, parental P 3 U 1, and either derivative were implanted into collagen gels separately, and co-cultured for 4 days. <b>Bodian</b> <b>staining</b> of the gel sections revealed that most superior cervical ganglion neurites turned toward the source of sCADM 1 -Fc, but not ΔsCADM 1 -Fc. Furthermore, immunofluorescence signals for sCADM 1 -Fc and membrane-bound CADM 1 were co-localized on the neurite surface. These results show that sCADM 1 appears to be involved in directional neurite extension by serving as an anchor to which membrane-bound CADM 1 on the neurites can bind...|$|E
40|$|Conventional light {{microscopic}} morphometrical investigations {{were performed}} on senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in eighteen senile brains. Specimens from the hippocampal region were investigated statistically {{whether or not there}} is any difference in detection of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles among the conventional staining methods, that is, Hematoxylin-Eosin stain, Congo red stain, Periodic acid Schiff reaction, <b>Bodian</b> <b>stain</b> and Bielschowsky- Hirano's silver stain. It was clarified that, even in the laboratory without specific antibody to senile plaque and neurofibrillary tangle, Bielschowsky-Hirano's stain is the most useful and convenient staining method for detection of these ageing-related changes...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantitative}} assessment of the age-dependent number of neuritic plaques {{is essential for the}} diagnosis of Alzheimer type dementia. This study reports the superiority of a modified Hortega-Globus stain compared to Bielschowsky and <b>Bodian</b> <b>stains</b> applied to samples obtained from ten brains of patients with a clinical history of progressive dementia. In two of ten cases only the modified Hortega-Globus stain allowed confirmation of the diagnosis of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT). The counts of neuritic plaques in sections stained by other methods were not sufficient to establish the histological diagnosis of SDAT. These results indicate that the choice of the most sensitive staining method is critical for the correct histopathologic diagnosis of the Alzheimer type dementia...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bodian</b> silver <b>staining</b> of {{guinea-pig}} Taenia coli {{produces a}} regular distribution of silver at {{the periphery of}} the smooth muscle cells. Electron microscopic analysis of this precipitate revealed that the membrane of the caveolae intracellularis was the only structure at {{the periphery of the}} cells that consistently exhibited a high affinity for silver. Thus, this staining method demonstrates that caveolae are distributed over most of the cell surface in an orderly pattern...|$|R
40|$|Animals rely on {{information}} provided by their senses to perform the complicated series of motor actions {{that allow them to}} obtain food and shelter, locate mates, and avoid predators. Interpreting sensory information and using it to guide behavior is one of the principle roles of the nervous system. In the insect brain, a system of midline neuropils called the central complex is thought to be the site at which sensory information is integrated and converted into the signals that initiate or modify motor outputs. This dissertation addresses three important questions for understanding how the central complex processes sensory information and influences behavior. These questions are: 1. What kind of sensory information is represented in the central complex? 2. What is the relationship of central complex neuropils to other brain regions? 3. Are such regions simply relay stations, or do they support computations that contribute to phenomena cautiously ascribed to the central complex, such as visual learning and memory? Using the flesh fly, Neobellieria bullata, intracellular recordings and dye fills were conducted to explore the sensory parameters that are relayed to the central complex. The results of these experiments along with previously published observations suggest that the sensory information relayed to the central complex differs from species to species and is likely matched to the behavior of each. Reconstructions of neurons labeled during intracellular recordings, cobalt injections, Golgi impregnations, immunohistochemistry, and <b>Bodian</b> <b>staining</b> were used to further explore the relationship between the central complex and the superior protocerebrum. These studies suggest that the superior protocerebrum is a complicated computation center, more intricately related to the central complex than has been previously assumed. These results are used to propose a network model for how one circuit in the central complex may perform some of the functions the central complex has experimentally been shown to mediate. The differences between this model and the elaboration of the central complex in vivo suggest that circuits within the central complex also support a variety of other computations. Finally, future experiments are described, investigating the role of the central complex in orientation of migrating monarch butterflies...|$|E
40|$|Canines {{are known}} for their natural {{development}} of age-related neuropathological brain lesions, such as beta amyloid deposits as senile plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and lipofuscin. Presence of these features in combination with cognitive decline and behavioral alterations is considered canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD). Studies have provided evidence of the beneficial effect of an antioxidant fortified diet in CCD patients and have connected these effects to reduced brain pathology. CCD in dogs shares similarities with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in humans, such as beta amyloid and tau pathology. The canine has therefore been suggested as a possibly promising animal model of AD. In scientific research devoted to AD, ApoE has suggested to be an important apolipoprotein in the disease pathology. Aims of the present investigation were to expand the knowledge of CCD and to support the view of the dog as a valuable animal model of AD. First, by studying the occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT’s). NFT’s and dense content containing plaques have not been consistently demonstrated in the dog. Second, by exploring the ApoE 4 immunoreactivity in dogs. From a veterinary standpoint, this study focuses on the possible correlation between the quantity of ApoE 4 staining and antioxidant dietary treatment. Therefore 11 of the 12 canines available for immunohistochemistry were divided into 3 groups. One group containing old demented dogs, the second group housed the old demented dogs with dietary treatment and the third group consisted of the control dogs. Histopathological evaluation of NFT’s with the <b>Bodian</b> silver <b>staining</b> method resulted in the finding of tangles in four of the six demented dogs. Immunoreactivity of canine ApoE 4 with human antibodies was found in all of the nine elderly dogs. A trend for lower ApoE 4 quantities was demonstrated, with evident differences between the ApoE 4 amount in the groups old demented and non-demented old control dogs. The distinction based on the ApoE 4 staining in macrophages (microglia) proved significant...|$|R
40|$|Vibrissae, or whiskers, are largest among {{pinnipeds}} and are specialized hairs {{that potentially}} evolved to serve sensory, thermoregulatory or protective functions. Behavioral data from pinniped and rodent vibrissa {{studies indicate that}} functional differences exist between medial microvibrissae and lateral macrovibrissae. However, comparative data are lacking, and current pinniped studies only focus on the largest ventrolateral macrovibrissae. Consequently, we investigated the medial-to-lateral innervation and microanatomy of harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) vibrissal Follicle-Sinus Complexes (F-SCs). F-SCs were sectioned either longitudinally or in cross-section. Sections remained unstained or were stained with a modified <b>Bodian</b> silver <b>stain</b> (innervation) or Masson?s trichrome stain (microanatomy). Harp seals possessed 88 - 105 F-SCs and each exhibited a tripartite blood organization system. Hair shafts were more circular medially but became more elliptical laterally. Medial F-SCs had more symmetrical dermal capsule thicknesses and distributions of major branches of the deep vibrissal nerve, but these symmetries diminished as F-SCs became more lateral. Medial-to-lateral axon counts ranged from 550 ? 97. 4 axons/F-SC (medial) to 1632 ? 173. 2 axons/F-SC (lateral). Overall, axon counts averaged 1221 ? 422. 3 axons/F-SC (n= 146 cross-sections), indicating a total of 117, 235 axons/snout. Lateral F-SCs alone possessed a mean of 1533 ? 192. 9 axons (n= 82 cross-sections), {{which is similar to}} counts reported in other pinniped vibrissal innervation studies. These data suggest that conventional studies that only examine lateral vibrissae overestimate total innervation by ~ 20 %. Moreover, we counted axon bundles with and without silver staining (n= 834) and determined that unstained sections yielded more accurate and ~ 10 % greater axon counts. Consequently, conventional analyses are likely only overestimating innervation by ~ 10 % overall. The relationship between axon count and F-SC surface area was non-linear (p<< 0. 01; n= 24 cross-sections), presumably from mechanoreceptors reaching carrying capacity, and axon densities were consistent across the snout. Presumptive Merkel-Neurite complexes and lanceolate endings were observed at the glassy membrane and outer root sheath interface. Our data agree well with behavioral research on pinnipeds and rodents that documents functional compartmentalization between micro-(medial) and macrovibrissae (lateral). Furthermore, our results support that vibrissal innervation variation observed among extant mammals initially diverged as a result of phylogeny and then environment (i. e., terrestrial, semi-aquatic, fully aquatic) ...|$|R
