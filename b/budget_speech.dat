It examines how these <b>Budget</b> <b>speeches</b> conceptualised the debate surrounding these reforms and discusses the extent to which this conceptualisation can be seen as reflecting the discursive character of a New Liberalism. The focus is on key collectivist concepts—“the state”, “the community”, “the people” and “the nation”. These were concepts which were very far from being the preserve of the Liberals but it is argued they were unpacked and used in ways that constituted a different conceptual terrain from that which had characterised previous Liberal <b>budget</b> <b>speeches.</b> The article {{considers the}} frequency of their usage but, more importantly, their collocation and rhetorical context and argues that these do indeed suggest that in important respects these budgets displayed a rhetorical character reflective of the ideology of New Liberalism...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of fiscal {{consolidation}} on the current account. We examine contemporaneous policy documents, including <b>Budget</b> <b>Speeches,</b> <b>Budgets,</b> and IMF and OECD reports, to identify changes in fiscal policy motivated primarily {{by the desire to}} reduce the budget deficit, and not by a response to the short-term economic outlook or the current account. Estimation results based on this measure of fiscal policy changes suggest that a 1 percent of GDP fiscal consolidation raises the current account balance-to-GDP ratio by about 0. 6 percentage point, supporting the twin deficits hypothesis. This effect is substantially larger than that obtained using standard measures of the fiscal policy stance, such as the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance. ...|$|R

This database therefore allows to search and retrieve contributions from individual deputies of the Dáil (Teachta Dála or TD) and to combine information about TDs' parties and constituencies {{with the history of}} political speeches and written answers. In addition, our database facilitates the application of content analysis software such as Wordscore (Laver, Benoit and Garry, 2003) or Wordfish (Slapin and Proksch, 2008) and makes it possible to estimate TDs' policy preferences from speeches.

Even the censorious critics of the leading journal found in the largeness and variety of the scheme its greatest recommendation, as suggesting an accord between the occasion, the man, and the measure, so marvellous that it would be a waste of all three not to accept them. Among other hearers was Lord Brougham, who for the first time since he had quitted the scene of his triumphs a generation before, came to the House of Commons, and for four hours listened intently to the orator who had now acquired the supremacy that was once his own. “The speech,” said Bulwer, “will remain among the monuments of English eloquence as long as the language lasts.” Napoleon begged Lord Cowley to convey his thanks to Mr. Gladstone for the copy of his <b>budget</b> <b>speech</b> he had sent him, which he said he would preserve “as a precious souvenir of a man who has my thorough esteem, and whose eloquence is of a lofty character commensurate with the grandeur of his views.” Prince Albert wrote to Stockmar (March 17), “Gladstone is now the real leader of the House, and works with an energy and vigour almost incredible.”(20) ...|$|E
