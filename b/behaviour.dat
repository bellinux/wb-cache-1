The neoclassical {{model of the}} consumer and its extensions provide the theoretical framework for most economic research on health <b>behaviours.</b> More recently, behavioural economic models that incorporate insights from psychology have been proposed as alternative models of health <b>behaviours,</b> especially <b>behaviours</b> involving addiction.

40|$|Objective: Planning can {{bridge the}} gap between {{intentions}} and action, but what bridges the gap between planning and action? This study helps to answer the question by disentangling the interrelationships between self-efficacy, planning and preparatory <b>behaviours</b> in predicting physical activity. Preparatory <b>behaviours</b> are tested as a working mechanism of planning. Moreover, it is tested whether the utility of preparatory <b>behaviours</b> depends on an individual’s level of self-efficacy. Methods: A survey assessed planning, self-efficacy and preparatory <b>behaviours</b> for physical activity. Adults (N = 166) provided data at two measurement points. In a longitudinal model, preparatory <b>behaviours</b> were specified as a mediator between planning and physical activity. Self-efficacy was specified as a possible moderator at two points in the model. Results: Preparatory <b>behaviours</b> mediated the relationship between planning and physical activity. An interaction between self-efficacy and preparatory <b>behaviours</b> on physical activity was found, indicating that individuals with low self-efficacy beliefs were more active if they engaged more frequently in preparatory <b>behaviours.</b> Conclusion: Planning seems to stimulate preparatory <b>behaviours,</b> which in turn make future physical activity more likely. Furthermore, as performing preparatory <b>behaviours</b> represent a step forward towards the enactment of behavioural goals, preparatory <b>behaviours</b> may be particular beneficial for individuals afflicted by self-doubts regarding physical activity...|$|R

5|$|There is no {{well-established}} {{treatment for}} self-injurious <b>behaviour</b> in children or adolescents.

Dialectical <b>behaviour</b> therapy (DBT) can be successful for those individuals exhibiting a personality disorder, and could potentially be used for those with other mental disorders who exhibit self-harming <b>behaviour.</b> Diagnosis and treatment of the causes of self-harm is thought {{by many to be the}} best approach to treating self-harm. But in some cases, particularly in people with a personality disorder, this is not very effective, so more clinicians are starting to take a DBT approach in order to reduce the <b>behaviour</b> itself. People who rely on habitual self-harm are sometimes hospitalised, based on their stability, their ability and especially their willingness to get help. In adolescents multisystem therapy shows promise.

40|$|Adverse {{childhood}} experiences-including parental {{and familial}} {{factors such as}} parental substance abuse, parental mental health problems, parental incarceration, parental unemployment and family violence, and personal factors such as physical, sexual, and emotional abuse- {{have been shown to}} strongly affect health risk <b>behaviours</b> in adulthood in the general population and are thus important in the health status of an individual. However, studies of people who use injection drugs have generally focused on disease seroprevalence and risk <b>behaviours</b> without considering their psychosocial histories. In the 2000 Regina Seroprevalence and Risk <b>Behaviours</b> Study, 255 people who use injection drugs completed a standardized, confidential, and anonymous interview which included questions on adverse childhood experiences and injection-related and sexual risk <b>behaviours.</b> Associations among and between participants' reported adverse childhood experiences and subsequent risk <b>behaviours</b> were tested. Demographic factors were also considered, and general linear models of factors associated with risk <b>behaviours</b> were developed. The rates of adverse childhood experiences and risk <b>behaviours</b> reported were very high. Several of the adverse childhood experiences studied were related to increased risk <b>behaviours.</b> The factors associated with injection-related risk <b>behaviours</b> were similar to those associated with sexual risk <b>behaviours.</b> The impact of adverse childhood experiences on risk <b>behaviours</b> was found to be cumulative; the more adverse childhood experiences the participants reported, the more risk <b>behaviours</b> they also reported.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clustering of {{multiple}} health-compromising <b>behaviours</b> {{is associated with}} an increased risk of various chronic diseases. There are few studies on patterns of clustering {{of multiple}} health-compromising <b>behaviours</b> in adolescents. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} assess how six health-compromising <b>behaviours,</b> namely, low fruit consumption, high sweet consumption, less frequent tooth brushing, low physical activity, physical fighting and smoking, cluster among Saudi male adolescents. METHODS: A representative stratified cluster random sample of 1, 335 Saudi Arabian male adolescents living in Riyadh city answered a questionnaire on health-related <b>behaviours.</b> Hierarchical Agglomerative Cluster Analysis (HACA) was used to identify cluster solutions of the six health-compromising <b>behaviours.</b> RESULTS: HACA suggested two broad and stable clusters for the six health-compromising <b>behaviours.</b> The first cluster included low fruit consumption, less frequent tooth brushing and low physical activity. The second cluster included high sweets consumption, smoking and physical fighting. CONCLUSIONS: The six health-compromising <b>behaviours</b> clustered into two conceptually distinct clusters among Saudi Arabian male adolescents, one reflecting non-adherence to preventive <b>behaviours</b> and the second undertaking of risk <b>behaviours.</b> Clustering of health <b>behaviours</b> has important implications for health promotion...|$|R
5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their <b>behaviour,</b> leading them to {{go to great lengths to}} conceal their <b>behaviour</b> from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal <b>behaviour.</b> People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking <b>behaviour</b> may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Acting on {{delusions}} is {{a significant}} clinical issue. The concept of safety <b>behaviours</b> [...] actions carried out {{with the intention of}} reducing perceived threat [...] provides a new way of understanding acting on delusions. A study was conducted with the aim of examining the prevalence and correlates of safety <b>behaviours</b> related to persecutory delusions. METHOD: One hundred patients with persecutory delusions were assessed for safety <b>behaviours,</b> acting on delusions, anxiety, depression, and psychotic symptoms. Case note data were collected on instances of serious violence or suicide attempts. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients had used safety <b>behaviours</b> in the last month. Greater use of safety <b>behaviours</b> was associated with higher levels of distress. A history of violence or suicide attempts was associated with greater use of safety <b>behaviours.</b> Safety <b>behaviours</b> were significantly associated with acting on delusions, but not with the negative symptoms of psychosis. CONCLUSION: Safety <b>behaviours</b> are a common form of acting on persecutory delusions. These <b>behaviours</b> have the consequence that they are likely to prevent the processing of disconfirmatory evidence and will therefore contribute to delusion persistence...|$|R
