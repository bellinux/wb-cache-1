40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) {{are characterized by}} their long-range oceanic and atmospheric transport, limited <b>biodegradation</b> <b>and</b> <b>bioaccumulation</b> along the trophic levels {{of the food chain}} [1]. Concentration of POPs in several species of the marine artic food chain can be very high, especially in fat of marine mammals. Consequently, human population in the Arctic that rely mainly on traditional foods, including consumption of marine species, can be exposed to levels of POPs exceeding established national guidelines [2]. The Stockholm Convention, an international agreement concluded in 2001, identified twelve POPs of most health concern at th...|$|E
40|$|For the {{purposes}} of risk assessment in aquatic environments, pathways, transport, persistence and bioaccumulation are the key determinants of exposure. Since metals are elements and since all non-radioactive elements, by definition, are persistent, the criterion of persistence is not a useful descriptor for metals. From a risk assessment perspective, it is the chemical form or "species" of a metal that is important. Indeed, only when metals are in a free cationic state, or part of a hydroxyl complex or organometallic compound, are they potentially available for uptake by organisms, and only then {{do they have the}} potential to bioaccumulate and to cause biological effects. For organometallics, the criteria of <b>biodegradation</b> <b>and</b> <b>bioaccumulation</b> can be applied as for organic chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Petro{{chemical}} {{and chemical}} wastewaters contain {{a great variety}} of contaminants needing different treatments for their removal. In recent decades, regulations for the final discharge of industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have set more and more stringent limits for macro- and micro-pollutants, requiring upgrades to existing WWTPs. This paper examines the interventions at the WWTP for the petrochemical site of Porto Marghera, near Venice, Italy. Due to extremely severe legal limits and bare available areas for plant upgrading, the existing Conventional Activated Sludges (CAS) tank was converted into a Membrane Biological Reactor (MBR). In this way, the increased sludge retention time (SRT) enhances nitrification <b>and</b> <b>biodegradation,</b> <b>bioaccumulation</b> <b>and</b> mineralization of the more persistent compounds and the passage through the ultrafiltration membrane guarantees a full solid-liquid separation. An analysis of the different forms of nitrogen in the treated wastewaters showed significant amounts of dissolved and recalcitrant organic nitrogen. The limit of 10 mg L- 1 for total nitrogen (TN) is met by the combined means of a membrane filtration, which removes the organic nitrogen discharged with the sludge flocks, and a post-denitrification...|$|R

Electrochemical test has been carried out for Tafel polarization to determine the corrosion rate of carbon steel. This research aimed to investigate the potential corrosion of carbon steel in seven different immersion,,periods (1, 2, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days) in seawater (3. 5 % NaC 1).

40|$|The toxic {{effects of}} the {{antifouling}} agent tributyltin (TBT) on three microalgal species, Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Dunaliella tertiolecta, were studied. Toxic effects of TBT on growth, reproduction and physiology of the microalgae were assessed. The 5 -day EC 50 on growth inhibition of C. vulgaris, C. pyrenoidosa and D. tertiolecta were 130 /μg I- 1, 33 μg 1 -l and 3 μg I- 1 TBT, respectively. The {{results indicated that the}} vulnerability to TBT was highly species dependent. When comparing with other species of microalgae, C. vulgaris was a highly tolerant microalgal species, with EC 50 value one or two order of magnitude higher. For this reason, the tolerant mechanism of microalgae was further investigated. The <b>biodegradation,</b> biosorption <b>and</b> <b>bioaccumulation</b> of TBT in C. vulgaris and C. pyrenoidosa were studied. The results of gas chromatography with flame photometric detector analysis showed that C. vulgaris could eliminate 50 % of the initial 100 μg 1 -l TBT from external medium in 60 hours. At the end of a 2 -week experimental period, it was measured that 25 % and 39 % of the original amount of TBT were degraded to dibutyltin (DBT) and monobutyltin (MBT), respectively. In contrast to C. vulgaris, DBT appeared to be the only degradation product for C. pyrenoidosu within the testing period, with 30 % of the original amount of TBT transformed into DBT. The results demonstrated that the higher tolerant ability of C. vulgaris may due to its capability in degrading TBT into less toxic metabolite. The biochemical study on the enzyme system involving in degradation process showed that the in vivo cytochtome P- 450 content in C. vulgaris was significantly increased after 4 -day exposure to sublethal concentration of TBT. A maximum of 80 -fold increase in cytochrome P- 450 was recorded. Meanwhile, the activity of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase was concurrently increased as cytochrome P- 450 when the algal cells were exposed to sublethal concentration. NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, rather than cytochrome b 5, was the potential primary electron donor for the mixed function oxygenase (MFO) reaction. Inhibition studies using piperonyl-butoxide, cinnamic acid and carbon monoxide greatly reduced the algal in vivo biotransformation of TBT by 74 %, 61 % and 60 %, respectively. All these results suggested that debutylation of TBT in C. vulgaris was mediated by a cytochrome P- 450 dependent oxygenase system...|$|R

40|$|The {{composition}} {{and distribution of}} triaromatic steroid hydrocarbons in oil residues after <b>biodegradation</b> <b>and</b> photo-oxidation processes were detected, and the diagnostic ratios for oil spill identification were developed and evaluated based on the relative standard deviation (RSD) and the repeatability limit. The preferential loss of C- 27 methyl triaromatic steranes (MTAS) relative to C- 28 MTAS and C- 29 MTAS was shown during the photo-oxidation process. In contrast to the photochemical degradation, the MTAS with the original 20 R biological configuration was preferentially degraded during the biodegradation process. The RSD {{of most of the}} diagnostic ratios of MTAS ranged from 9 to 84 % during the photo-oxidation process. However, the RSDs of such ratios derived from MTAS were all < 5 % even in high <b>biodegradation,</b> <b>and</b> such parameters may also provide new methods on oil spill identification. The parameters of monoaromatic sterane and monoaromatic sterane are not used well for oil spilt identification after photo-oxidation. The triaromatic steroid hydrocarbons retained their molecular compositions after <b>biodegradation</b> <b>and</b> photo-oxidation and most of the diagnostic ratios derived from them could be efficiently used in oil spill identification...|$|R
