40|$|AbstractOyster {{mushroom}} (Pleurotus ostreatus) was cultivated on {{rice straw}} basal substrate, wheat straw basal substrate, cotton seed hull basal substrate, and wheat straw or rice straw supplemented with different proportions (15 %, 30 %, and 45 % in rice straw substrate, 20 %, 30 %, and 40 % in wheat straw substrate) of cotton seed hull {{to find a}} cost effective substrate. The effect of autoclaved sterilized and non-sterilized substrate on growth and yield of oyster mushroom was also examined. Results indicated that for both sterilized substrate and non-sterilized substrate, oyster mushroom on rice straw and wheat basal substrate have faster mycelial growth rate, comparatively poor surface mycelial density, shorter total colonization period and days from <b>bag</b> <b>opening</b> to primordia formation, lower yield and biological efficiency, lower mushroom weight, longer stipe length and smaller cap diameter than that on cotton seed hull basal substrate. The addition of cotton seed hull to rice straw and wheat straw substrate slowed spawn running, primordial development and fruit body formation. However, {{increasing the amount of}} cotton seed hull can increase the uniformity and white of mycelium, yield and biological efficiency, and increase mushroom weight, enlarge cap diameter and shorten stipe length. Compared to the sterilized substrate, the non-sterilized substrate had comparatively higher mycelial growth rate, shorter total colonization period and days from <b>bag</b> <b>opening</b> to primordia formation. However, the non-sterilized substrate did not gave significantly higher mushroom yield and biological efficiency than the sterilized substrate, but some undesirable characteristics, i. e. smaller mushroom cap diameter and relatively long stipe length...|$|R

40|$|Provision of {{machining}} accuracy is a relevant objective in technology {{of mechanical engineering}} and its solution allows to guarantee an operational accuracy of mechanisms and machines, their wear resistance, reliability and durability. In order to solve the given task a method has been proposed {{in the paper that}} permits to ensure the highest {{machining accuracy}} margin on the basis of multiple-factor optimization of parameters for technological process while using methods of artificial intelligence. To ensure the machining accuracy by point tools, an intellectual system has been developed and it is based on technologies of functional semantic networks. For revealing correctness of SEMANTIC intellectual system operation an experimental inspection of its working capacity has been carried out in the paper. The paper contains description of the methodology for In article the technique of experimental investigations and their purpose is to make a comparative analysis of actual errors in <b>opening</b> <b>machining</b> with the machining errors predicted by the SEMANTIC system on the basis of functional semantic network application. The investigations have made it possible to determine dependences of axial misalignment in the <b>machined</b> <b>openings</b> on tool advance and its rotation frequency while making openings by high-speed steel drills. The paper presents analysis results of limiting and probable values for components of a total machining error. It has been shown that while making assessment of machining accuracy it is necessary to consider probabilistic nature of occurrence of total error components that are setting upper boundary as it is realized in the described intellectual system. The semantic network permits to compare errors in arrangement of opening axes which are machined in accordance with admissible drill advance and rotation frequency and corresponding experimental values. The experimental investigations prove the possibility to use an approach for forecasting a total machining error which is based on application of functional semantic network technology.   </p...|$|R

40|$|The HANDSS- 55 Transuranic Waste Sorting Module is {{designed}} to sort out items found in 55 -gallon drums of waste as determined by an operator. Innovative imaging techniques coupled with fast linear motor-based motion systems and a flexible end-effector system allow the operator to remove items from the waste stream by {{a touch of the}} finger. When all desired items are removed from the waste stream, the remaining objects are automatically moved to a repackaging port for removal from the glovebox/cell. The Transuranic Waste Sorting Module consists of 1) a high accuracy XYZ Stereo Measurement and Imaging system, 2) a vibrating/tilting sorting table, 3) an XY Deployment System, 4) a ZR Deployment System, 5) several user-selectable end-effectors, 6) a waste <b>bag</b> <b>opening</b> system, 7) control and instrumentation, 8) a noncompliant waste load-out area, and 9) a Human/Machine Interface (HMI).

The operator identifies the object by locating the visual image on a large color display and touches the image on the display with his finger.
