Implication of this theories {{are of the}} great importance for philosophy of time. This paper concern topology of time in context of existence of the multiverse. We will show that topology of time in such multiverse, whose particular universes would be generated due to eternal chaotic inflation, should be non-standard {{and that in the}} case of existence of multiverse only model which include topology of <b>brenching</b> time should be acceptable like real description of multiverse. Moreover, we will show that, the existence of hypothetical entities like Kerr`s rotating black holes, also represent necessary and sufficient condition of branching spacetime in such multiverse...|$|R

He bought the castle of Alcarrás by Guillem de Cardona in 1249 and {{received}} authority from {{the king of the}} castles of Cinca, Malda and Maldanell as a reward for his participation in the Valencia's campaign. In the fourteenth century the members of this <b>brench</b> resided on carrer Major of Lleida and owned many lordships: Alcarràs, Montagut, Sarroca de Lleida, Llardecans, Vilanova de Remolins and large estates in Flix and La Palma d'Ebre (the last two were sold to Barcelona in 1398). Francesc de Santcliment, noble citizen of Lleida, was in the service of Peter IV of Aragon, who sent him as ambassador to Avignon in 1336 and as a defender of the Aran Valley against the bishop of Comminges; Francesc founded the family chapel in the cathedral of Lleida. One of his children, Pere, was chancellor of the university of Lleida (1387-1403), canon and then bishop of Lleida, while is son Francesc was paer in 1380 and veguer in 1413. The son of Francesc, Bernat de Santcliment, carried out a long lawsuit against the chapter of Lleida for some lands near Montagut, that he ended lost. He also fought in the war against John II of Aragon in 1467 and was paer. It seems that from the sixteenth century the decline of this branch is evident because they neither have nor Alcarrás, Sarroca or Llardecans.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} have {{investigated}} a fundamental theory for planning of seasonal water requirement for paddy field,improving the Critical Block Method (hereafter CB Method). Then to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} theory, they applied it to the YAHAGIGAWA water use district,which is located in Aichi Pref [...] Main results obtained are as follows; 1. Improvements in the block-kind judgements of the CB Method (Chap. 1 and Chap. 9). The block-kind judgements in the CB Method become difficult and complicated as the blocks increase number. The authors succeeded in working out these problems, by separating judgement into two parts: divisional judgement (D-judgement) and quantitative judgement (Q-judgement). D judgement is the means for calculating water quantity of divisional and returned flow under a part blench canal. It is done independent of other areas. Q-judegement is the means for caluculating water requirement in a whole area,under considering the results of D-judgement. In the actual process of planning, the block-kind judgement are done easily, correctly and swiftly. 2. Proposition concerning the fundamental theory for planning of seasonal water requirement (Chap. 2, Chap. 7 and Chap. 8). The CBMethod has been proposed for calculating maximun quantity of water requirement for a paddy field. Therefore, when we nead seasonal quantity of water, the necessary fundamental theory is insufficient. In this report; we proposed the general idea for planning that has been summarized in the coefficient of seasonol demand quantity (fı) and coefficient of seasonal repeating quantity (rı). The former is expressed in the equation (2 - 4) and the latter is expressed in the equation (2 - 11). If we multiply fı(or rı), by water requirement in depth and paddy field area, we can obtain seasonal demand quantity (or seasonal repeating quantity) in each block. 3. Estimation of the saved quarity by repeated use (Chap. 10). Applying the above described theory to the YAHAGIGAWA water district, we estimated the saved quantity by repeated use. Generally, repeated use is divided into two types, in one <b>brench</b> canal area and among mary <b>brench</b> canal areas. In the YAHAGIGAWA water district, repeated use saved 24 percent of water requirement on the average. Then,in the quantity of water, repeated use in a <b>brench</b> canal occupied about 38 percent and among many <b>brench</b> canals about 62 percent (Table. 10 - 5). Especially, the percentage was the highest during from June 16 th to 30 th and from August 1 st to 1 Oth, about 30 percent (Table. 10 - 5). 4. Comparison of the practical data with calculated results on the quantity of water requirement. The practical date during non-rainy days from 1973 to 1979 was compared with D-judgement and Q-judgement results. Consequently, the seasonal pattern calucuated shifted foward about 10 days (Fig. 10 - 2). This is {{explained by the fact that}} the rice-planting season has been moved in foward recent　years. Considering this gap,the puantity of Q-judgement was 59 percent and D-judgement was 84 percent of the practical data. Thus, it becomes clear that repcated water use had deep significance for the water requirement in this district...|$|E
