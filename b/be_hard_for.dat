5|$|Those {{who engage}} in self-harm face the {{contradictory}} reality of harming themselves {{while at the same}} time obtaining relief from this act. It may even <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> some to actually initiate cutting, but they often do because they know the relief that will follow. For some self-harmers this relief is primarily psychological while for others this feeling of relief comes from the beta endorphins released in the brain. Endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury, act as natural painkillers, and induce pleasant feelings and would act to reduce tension and emotional distress. Many self-harmers report feeling very little to no pain while self-harming and, for some, deliberate self-harm may become a means of seeking pleasure.|$|E

25|$|Other {{forms of}} {{intangible}} performance include status symbols, {{such as a}} corner office, and increased autonomy and freedom. Increased autonomy demonstrates trust in an employee, may decrease occupational stress and improve job satisfaction. A 2010 study found positive relationships between job satisfaction and life satisfaction, happiness at work, positive affect, {{and the absence of}} negative affect which may also be interrelated with work motivation. Since it may <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> an employee to achieve a similar level of trust in a new organization, increased autonomy may also help improve retention.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{his support}} among {{elements}} of the party, Zuma remained a powerful political figure, retaining a high position in the ANC even after his dismissal as the country's deputy president. A panel of political analysts convened in November 2005 agreed {{that if he was}} to be found innocent of the corruption charges brought against him, it would <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> any other potential ANC candidate to beat Zuma {{in the race for the}} country's presidency in 2009. However, these analysts also questioned whether Zuma was indeed a left-wing candidate of the sort that many of his supporters seem to seek, and noted that the global and national economic constraints that have shaped Mbeki's presidency would be no different in the next presidential term.|$|E
25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words than lexical measures, so hence consume more research instrument space and more respondent time to complete. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Often forget to put things back in their proper place, or Am careful to avoid making mistakes. Some statement-based measures of conscientiousness have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, but their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For instance, statements in colloquial North American English like Often forget to put things back in their proper place or Am careful to avoid making mistakes can <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> non-native English-speakers to understand, suggesting internationally validated measures might be more appropriate for research conducted with non-North Americans.|$|E

25|$|One {{theory is}} that these {{problems}} are caused by a structural contradiction within the euro system, the {{theory is that}} there is a monetary union (common currency) without a fiscal union (e.g., common taxation, pension, and treasury functions). In the Eurozone system, the countries are required to follow a similar fiscal path, but they do not have common treasury to enforce it. That is, countries with the same monetary system have freedom in fiscal policies in taxation and expenditure. So, even though there are some agreements on monetary policy and through the European Central Bank, countries may not be able to or would simply choose not to follow it. This feature brought fiscal free riding of peripheral economies, especially represented by Greece, as it is hard to control and regulate national financial institutions. Furthermore, there is also a problem that the Eurozone system has a difficult structure for quick response. Eurozone, having 18 nations as its members, require unanimous agreement for a decision making process. This would lead to failure in complete prevention of contagion of other areas, as it would <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the Eurozone to respond quickly to the problem.|$|E
25|$|After {{close to}} a month without {{international}} cricket, Australia toured India for two Tests and three one-day games in October, in {{what would be the}} team's last Test series ahead of the summer's Ashes in Australia. Haddin again failed to recover sufficiently for the series and Paine was named wicket-keeper. In a drawn three-day first-class match before the Test series, Paine scored a slow 45 and zero; failing to capitalise on his promotion to four in the batting order for the second innings. Returning to the traditional wicket-keepers spot of seven for the Test series, Paine battled to his highest Test score, 92 from 196 balls, in the first innings of the First Test in Mohali. In hot conditions, he displayed good shot selection and concentration, despite suffering from cramp in the latter stages of his innings. Still, when Australia was bowled out soon after his dismissal, Paine assumed wicket-keeper duties for India’s innings, where he took two catches. In his team's second innings, however, Paine scored only nine, as Australia collapsed to set India a target of 216 runs. They achieved the score with just one wicket remaining; Paine taking one catch. After the Test, Melbourne newspaper The Herald Sun, wrote an article saying that Paine could become Australia's future Test captain. The Second Test saw him continue his good form with the bat, scoring 59 and 9, but Australia lost the match and the series 2–0. Afterwards, former Australian wicket-keeper Rodney Marsh suggested it would <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Haddin to regain his spot in the Australian team for the Ashes. India won the opening one-dayer and therefore took the series 1–0 when rain washed out the remaining two matches. Paine struggled in the match, compiling 9 from 24 balls.|$|E
