5|$|In the {{earliest}} {{forms of the}} story, the woman's pig-like appearance {{was the result of}} witchcraft. Following her wedding day, the pig-faced woman's new husband was granted the choice of having her appear <b>beautiful</b> <b>to</b> him but pig-like to others, or pig-like to him and <b>beautiful</b> <b>to</b> others. When her husband told her that the choice was hers, the enchantment was broken and her pig-like appearance vanished. These stories became particularly popular in England, and later in Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The {{prominent}} social thinker and {{art critic}} John Ruskin, who had many associations with Keswick, {{once said that}} the town was a place almost too <b>beautiful</b> <b>to</b> live in. In October 1900, mainly {{through the efforts of}} Rawnsley, a simple memorial of Borrowdale slate was erected to Ruskin at Friars Crag. The monument is a now a Grade II listed structure.|$|E
50|$|In short, the <b>Beautiful,</b> {{according}} <b>to</b> Burke, {{is what is}} well-formed and aesthetically pleasing, {{whereas the}} Sublime is what {{has the power to}} compel and destroy us. The preference for the Sublime over the <b>Beautiful</b> was <b>to</b> mark the transition from the Neoclassical to the Romantic era.|$|R

5|$|While he was {{instrumental}} in the academic exploration of his techniques (he compiled two treatises: the later one in five volumes was substantially complete when he died and was published posthumously), and was himself a master of music analysis, he considered the development and study of techniques a means to intellectual, aesthetic, and emotional ends. Thus Messiaen maintained that a musical composition must be measured against three separate criteria: it must be interesting, <b>beautiful</b> <b>to</b> listen to, and it must touch the listener.|$|E
5|$|Forster's main interest, however, {{was again}} {{focused on the}} social {{behavior}} of people, as 15 years earlier in the Pacific. The national uprisings in Flanders and Brabant and the revolution in France sparked his curiosity. The journey through these regions, together with the Netherlands and England, where citizens' freedoms were equally well developed, in the end helped him to resolve his own political opinions. From that time on {{he was to be}} a confident opponent of the ancien régime. With other German scholars, he welcomed the outbreak of the revolution as a clear consequence of the Enlightenment. As early as July 30, 1789, shortly after he heard about the Storming of the Bastille, he wrote to his father-in-law, philologist Christian Gottlob Heyne, that it was <b>beautiful</b> <b>to</b> see what philosophy had nurtured in people's minds and then had realized in the state. To educate people about their rights in this way, he wrote, was after all the surest way; the rest would then result as if by itself.|$|E
5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and look <b>beautiful,</b> <b>to</b> be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went braless, they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E

His partner Marshall Herskovitz thought, however, that Silverstone was too <b>beautiful</b> <b>to</b> play a conflicted teenager uncertain of herself.

Oberon might have paid Puck with it for bringing the blossom which bewitched Titania." [...] Willis' Bank Note List stated that [...] "there is no probability of them ever getting into general circulation; they are altogether too small." [...] The North Carolina Standard hoped {{that they would be}} struck at the Charlotte Mint and circulated locally to eliminate the problem of small-denomination bank notes from out of state. Coin dealer and numismatic author Q. David Bowers notes that the head of Liberty on the Type 1 dollar is a scaled-down version of that on the double eagle, and [...] "a nicely preserved gold dollar is <b>beautiful</b> <b>to</b> behold".|$|E

His captaincy [...] "welded with wit, kindness and some practical joking a raw team into a formidable unit, nurturing such youngsters as Archie Jackson, Stan McCabe and (Sir) Donald Bradman". He hit a century in each innings against Queensland in their inaugural Sheffield Shield match in 192627. The following season he registered the highest score of his career, 315 not out in 388minutes versus Queensland at the SCG. Bradman wrote of this performance, [...] "...although they say Victor Trumper was even more <b>beautiful</b> <b>to</b> watch, it is hard to conceive more graceful batting than our skipper produced on that occasion." [...] Kippax ended the season with 926runs at an average of 84.18.|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Davies {{had first}} offered {{the ship to}} the U.S. Department of the Navy in 1941, but the Navy turned her down. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt objected to the ship {{entering}} service, remarking that she was too <b>beautiful</b> <b>to</b> be sacrificed. However, on January 7, 1942, the Navy reassessed their position, chartering the ship for $1 per year. The Navy sent Sea Cloud from Georgetown, South Carolina, to the United States Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland, to be refitted as a [...] "weather observation station vessel", and had its four masts removed and hull painted battleship gray. Sea Cloud was commissioned as a United States Coast Guard Cutter on April 4, 1942, and assigned to the Eastern Sea Frontier, with a permanent home port in Boston.|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft relies {{extensively}} on {{the language of the}} sublime in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. She draws on and redefines Edmund Burke's central terms in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757). Burke privileges the sublime (which he associates with masculinity, terror, awe, and strength) over the beautiful (which he associates with femininity, passivity, delicacy, and weakness), while Wollstonecraft ties the sublime to sterility and the <b>beautiful</b> <b>to</b> fertility. For her, the beautiful is connected to the maternal; this aesthetic shift is evident, for example, in the many passages focusing on the affectionate tie between Wollstonecraft and little Fanny, her daughter. She thus claims the feminine category of the [...] "beautiful" [...] for the most virtuous and useful of women: mothers.|$|E
