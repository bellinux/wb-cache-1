5000|$|For a given anode plane wire, {{the signal}} {{produced}} {{will have a}} specific form that depends on whether the wire is located in an induction plane or in a collection plane.

As the electron moves away from a wire, it induces a current in the opposite direction, producing an output [...] "bump" [...] of the opposite sign as the first. The result is a <b>bipolar</b> <b>signal.</b> In contrast, signals for a collection plane wire are unipolar, since electrons do not pass by the wire but are instead [...] "collected" [...] by it. For both of these geometries, a larger signal amplitude implies that more drift electrons either passed by the wire (for induction planes) or were collected by it (for the collection plane).|$|E

First, responses of rods increased linearly with flash strength, while those of rod bipolars increased supralinearly. Second, fluctuations in the responses of rod bipolars were larger than expected from linear summation of the rod inputs. Rod-OFF <b>bipolar</b> <b>signal</b> transfer did not share this strong nonlinearity. Surprisingly, nonlinear rod-rod <b>bipolar</b> <b>signal</b> transfer eliminated many of the rod’s single-photon responses. The impact on sensitivity, however, was more than compensated for by rejection of noise from rods that did not absorb photons. As a consequence, rod bipolars provide a nearoptimal readout of rod signals at light levels near visual threshold...|$|E

50|$|Another {{benefit of}} bipolar {{encoding}} compared to unipolar is error detection. In the T-carrier example, the <b>bipolar</b> <b>signals</b> are regenerated {{at regular intervals}} so that signals diminished by distance are not just amplified, but detected and recreated anew. Weakened signals corrupted by noise could cause errors, a mark interpreted as zero, or zero as positive or negative mark. Every single-bit error results in {{a violation of the}} bipolar rule. Each such bipolar violation (BPV) is an indication of a transmission error. (The location of BPV is not necessarily the location of the original error).|$|R

Later, other colors were introduced, e.g. yellow for triggers. By keeping output impedances low, Serge largely avoided the need for screened cables. 3.5 mm sockets were used for some audio interfacing to the outside World.|$|R

The computational requirement to implement the optimal Bayesian symbol-decision equalizer using RBFN [1] can be very high as the optimal Bayesian solution requires a large number of centers.

40|$|Background: Anisotropy in {{conduction}} velocity (CV) {{is a key}} substrate abnormality influencing atrial arrhythmias. In skeletal muscle fibers, CV and frequency content of the surface electromyogram signal are directly related. We hypothesized that in human atria the frequency content of the <b>bipolar</b> <b>signal,</b> recorded on the endocardial surface, {{is directly related to}} the local CV. Methods: In 15 patients submitted to ablation of supraventricular arrhythmias, incremental pacing was performed through an octapolar catheter inserted into the coronary sinus (CS), alternatively from both extremities in two different sequences: CS bipole 1 - 2 as the pacing site and CS bipole 7 - 8 as the detection site in the first, and vice versa in the second. The pacing cycle length (PCL) was stepwise decreased from 600 ms to 500 ms, 400 ms, 300 ms, until 250 ms. Estimation of the CV was performed as the ratio between the distance traveled by the propagating pulse and the propagation time. The frequency distribution of the signal energy was estimated using the fast Fourier transform, and the characteristic frequency (CF) was estimated as the barycenter of the frequency spectrum. Results: A total of 2, 496 bipolar signals were analyzed; CV and CF were estimated and compared. The single patient and group data analysis showed a significant direct correlation between CV and CF of the local <b>bipolar</b> <b>signal.</b> Conclusions: Comparing the degree of spectral compression among signals registered in different points of the endocardial cardiac surface in response to decreasing PCL enables to map local differences in CV, a useful arrhythmogenic substrate index...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{analysis}} of the bipolar budding pattern of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has suggested that it depends on persistent positional signals that mark {{the region of the}} division site and the tip of the distal pole on a newborn daughter cell, as well as each previous division site on a mother cell. In an attempt to identify genes encoding components of these signals or proteins involved in positioning or responding to them, we identified 11 mutants with defects in bipolar but not in axial budding. Five mutants displaying a bipolar budding-specific randomization of budding pattern had mutations in four previously known genes (BUD 2, BUD 5, SPA 2, and BNI 1) and one novel gene (BUD 6), respectively. As Bud 2 p and Bud 5 p are known to be required for both the axial and bipolar budding patterns, the alleles identified here probably encode proteins that have lost their ability to interact with the <b>bipolar</b> positional <b>signals</b> but have retained their ability to interact with the distinct positional signal used in axial budding. The function of Spa 2 p is not known, but previous work has shown that its intracellular localization is similar to that postulated for the <b>bipolar</b> positional <b>signals.</b> BNI 1 was originally identified on the basis of genetic interaction with CDC 12, which encodes one of the neck-filament-associated septin proteins, suggesting that these proteins may be involved in positioning the <b>bipolar</b> <b>signals.</b> One mutant with a heterogeneous budding pattern defines a second novel gene (BUD 7). Two mutants budding almost exclusively from the proximal pole carry mutations in a fourth novel gene (BUD 9).
