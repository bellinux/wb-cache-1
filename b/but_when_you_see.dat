500|$|After the {{election}} {{and the return of}} the National Government, little happened to support Baldwin's optimistic words. In the House of Commons on 2 March 1936, Wilkinson spoke of the [...] "atmosphere of mystery" [...] that surrounded the Jarrow scheme: [...] "Publicly one sees tremendous optimism... <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> people privately {{there is a great deal}} of humming and ha'ing, and they are not quite sure". Meanwhile, the BISF argued that increased steel production should be achieved by expanding capacity in existing facilities, rather than by building new plant. Duncan, in a reversal of his earlier attitude, now opposed the provision of finance for Jarrow which, he felt, might create a precedent that other distressed areas could exploit. The BISF finally succeeded in watering down the scheme to the extent that [...] it became unviable; Salt and his syndicate withdrew, and the scheme was dead, [...] "strangled at birth" [...] according to Wilkinson.|$|E
500|$|The artwork for Follow the Leader {{was done}} by Todd McFarlane Entertainment, with McFarlane and fellow Image Comics artists Greg Capullo (penciller) and Brian Hagelin (colorist) doing the album cover, and {{designer}} Brent Ashe handling the graphics work. According to drummer David Silveria, the band got interested in McFarlane after hearing that [...] "Todd had actually referred to us as 'the Doors of the 90's'", leading to them recording a song for Spawn, a film based on a comic book by McFarlane, and eventually approaching the artist to make an album cover for them. The cover art depicts a child hopscotching off a cliff and a gathering of kids waiting to follow, a concept that begun with bassist Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu and sketched by a friend of Jonathan Davis before being submitted to McFarlane. It marked the third straight Korn cover featuring children in a disturbing context, which Davis explained by saying that [...] "Children are always scared when they're all happy and stuff. They're {{the most beautiful thing}} in the world, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> it in our artwork, the way we've placed it, it's just kinda fuckin' weird." [...] The [...] "Freak on a Leash" [...] music video features animated segments by McFarlane featuring this cover art.|$|E
500|$|Johnston {{was entered}} as a {{competitor}} {{in the second}} series of Britain's Got Talent by his mother. He passed the first public audition, singing [...] "Pie Jesu" [...] from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Requiem. Amanda Holden, one of the competition's judges, was brought to tears, and the audience offered Johnston a standing ovation. Johnston was tipped as the favourite to win the competition. Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that [...] "it was scary singing in front of 2,500 people. I had never sang on stage before â€“ then there was also Simon, Amanda and Piers". He won his semi-final heat on 27 May 2008, receiving the most public votes on the night and thereby qualifying for the final. He sang [...] "Tears in Heaven" [...] by Eric Clapton; judge Holden {{told him he had}} [...] "a gift from God in [...] voice". At the final on 30 May, he again sang [...] "Pie Jesu". He finished in third place, behind the winner, the street dancer George Sampson and runners-up, the dance group Signature. Johnston left the stage in tears, later saying that he [...] "was upset. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the talent that was there, it was an honour just to be in the final". The day after the final, Cowell's publicist Max Clifford said that it was [...] "quite possible" [...] that Cowell would be offering record contracts to some of the finalists, including Johnston. Johnston and other contestants then embarked on a national arena tour.|$|E

I sort of buy that they're out living their lives. I've been very upfront with the studio and network in saying, Look, the audience may not accept a new version of the show.

Fincher had {{previously}} used the Thomson Viper {{over the past three years}} on commercials for Nike, Hewlett Packard, Heineken and Lexus which allowed him to get used to and experiment with the equipment. He was able to use inexpensive desktop software like Final Cut Pro to edit Zodiac.

The other night, in the street, I was {{watching}} an omnibus passing with lit-up windows, when I heard some one coughing at my side as though he would cough his soul out; and turning round, I saw him stopping under a lamp, with a brown greatcoat buttoned round him and his whole face convulsed.

6000|$|... "There {{are various}} {{ways of looking}} at that question," [...] replied the squire. [...] "Many men desire the {{prolongation}} of life as a lengthened period of enjoyment. There is, perhaps, something of that feeling with me; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> how far I am crippled and curtailed, how my enjoyments are confined to breathing the air, to eating and drinking, and to the occasional reading of a few pages, you must admit that there cannot be much of that. A conversation with you is the best of it. Some want to live for the sake of their wives and children. In the ordinary acceptation of the words, that is all over with me. Many desire to live because they fear to die. There is nothing of that in me, I can assure you. I am not afraid to meet my Creator. But there are those who wish for life that their purposes of love, or stronger purposes of hatred, may be accomplished. I am among the number. But, on that account, I only wish it till those purposes have been completed. I think I'll go to sleep for an hour; but {{there are a couple of}} letters I want you to write before post-time."

[...] "We went into season {{with the sense of}} talking about decisions in the team members' lives, and there have been elements of things Tony has been reflecting on all season, which is really why we wanted to do a story with Wendy", executive producer Gary Glasberg told TV Guide.

5000|$|Justin Chang of Variety had a mixed reaction, {{writing that}} the film [...] "gets some mileage out of its game performances, luscious {{production}} design and the unfettered enthusiasm director Sam Raimi brings to a thin, simplistic origin story." [...] He also compared the film's scale with the Star Wars prequel trilogy adding, [...] "In a real sense, Oz the Great and Powerful has a certain kinship with George Lucas' Star Wars prequels, {{in the way it}} presents a beautiful but borderline-sterile digital update of a world that was richer, purer and a lot more fun in lower-tech form. Here, too, the actors often look artificially superimposed against their CG backdrops, though the intensity of the fakery generates its own visual fascination." [...] /Film rated the film 7 out of 10, saying it had [...] "many charms" [...] while considering it to be [...] "basically Army of Darkness: (Normal guy lands in magical land, is forced to go on quest to save that land.) <b>But</b> just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> Raimi's kinetic, signature style starting to unleash, the story forces the film back into its Disney shell to play to the masses.
