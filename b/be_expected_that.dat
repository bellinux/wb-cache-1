5|$|According to Hepburn (2006, pp.238–239), “it should <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> {{industry}} will lobby furiously against any auctioning.” Hepburn et al. (2006) state {{that it is}} an empirical fact that while businesses tend to oppose auctioning of emissions permits, economists almost uniformly recommend auctioning permits. Garnaut notes that the complexity of free allocation, and the large amounts of money involved, encourage non-productive rent-seeking behaviour and lobbying of governments, activities that dissipate economic value.|$|E
5|$|Given that E°(O2/H2O) = +1.229V, {{which is}} less than +1.395V, it would <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> {{chlorine}} {{should be able to}} oxidise water to oxygen and hydrochloric acid. However, the kinetics of this reaction are unfavorable, and there is also a bubble overpotential effect to consider, so that electrolysis of aqueous chloride solutions evolves chlorine gas and not oxygen gas, a fact that is very useful for the industrial production of chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Germany has an {{installed}} capacity {{of wind and}} solar that can exceed daily demand, and has been exporting peak power to neighboring countries, with exports which amounted to some 14.7 billion kWh in 2012. A more practical solution is the installation of thirty days storage capacity able to supply 80% of demand, which will become necessary when most of Europe's energy is obtained from wind power and solar power. Just as the EU requires member countries to maintain 90 days strategic reserves of oil it can <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> countries will provide electric power storage, instead of expecting to use their neighbors for net metering.|$|E

5|$|With common {{ingredients}} including the olive, wheat, and grape; a shared climate; {{and a long}} period for cultural exchange, it might <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> a single, pan-Mediterranean cuisine would have developed. Certain items, such as olive oil, bread, wine, roast lamb or mutton (for example, Maghreb méchoui, Greek kleftiko and souvlaki, Turkish shish kebab), bottarga, and stews of meat with vegetables and tomato (such as Spanish andrajos, French estouffade à la Provençale, Italian ciambotta, Turkish buğu kebabı), are indeed found all around the Mediterranean. Despite this, however, the lands bordering the Mediterranean sea have distinct regional cuisines, from the Maghreb, Levant and Ottoman to the Italian, French, and Spanish. Each of those, in turn, has national and provincial variations.|$|E
5|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles offer users {{the opportunity to}} sell electricity stored in their batteries back to the power grid, thereby helping utilities to operate more efficiently {{in the management of}} their demand peaks. A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system would take advantage of the fact that most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time. During such idle times the electricity stored in the batteries could be transferred from the PEV to the power lines and back to the grid. In the U.S this transfer back to the grid have an estimated value to the utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car. In a V2G system it would also <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would have the capability to communicate automatically with the power grid to sell demand response services by either delivering electricity into the grid or by throttling their charging rate.|$|E
5|$|The {{sides of}} the Tor have seven deep, roughly {{symmetrical}} terraces, or lynchets. Their formation remains a mystery with many possible explanations. They may have been formed {{as a result of}} natural differentiation of the layers of Lias stone and clay used by farmers during the Middle Ages as terraced hills to make ploughing for crops easier. Author Nicholas Mann questions this theory. If agriculture had been the reason for the creation of the terraces, it would <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> the effort would be concentrated on the south side, where the sunny conditions would provide a good yield, but the terraces are equally deep on the northern side, which would provide little benefit. Additionally, none of the other slopes of the island have been terraced, even though the more sheltered locations would provide a greater return on the labour involved. Alternatively, the flattened paths may have been created by the hooves of grazing cattle.|$|E

40|$|Introduction A {{method is}} {{described}} to jointly estimate source and head parameters in a simultaneous MEG and EEG analysis. This simultaneous analysis {{would be very}} beneficial {{if it can be}} shown that it profits from the advantages of both modalities [e. g. 1]. First, the highest spatial gradients, and thus the preferred directions, differ between MEG and EEG. It <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> both directions <b>are</b> precise in a simultaneous analysis. Second, deep sources hardly generate a MEG signal. Therefore source precision deteriorates fast with depth. It <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> this disadvantage <b>is</b> countered in a simultaneous analysis. Third, the precision of superficial sources is higher for MEG than for EEG. It <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> a simultaneous analysis profits from this advantage. Fourth, the radial component of a dipole cannot be estimated from MEG. It <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> this component can be estimated reliably in a simultaneous analysis. Fifth, EEG requires accurate information concerning the radii and...|$|R
25|$|But {{even after}} {{exceeding}} the specified limits and the capacitors having reached their “end of life” the electronic circuit {{is not in}} immediate danger; only the functionality of the capacitors is reduced. With today's high levels of purity {{in the manufacture of}} electrolytic capacitors it is not to <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> short circuits occur after the end-of-life-point with progressive evaporation combined with parameter degradation.|$|E
25|$|In this circumstance, it may <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> {{there may}} also be active other drivers of {{diffusive}} flux of internal energy, such as gradient of chemical potential which drives transfer of matter, and gradient of electric potential which drives electric current and iontophoresis; such effects usually interact with diffusive flux of internal energy driven by temperature gradient, and such interactions are known as cross-effects.|$|E
25|$|Given this {{emphasis}} on biology in the three-factor approach, it would <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> the third trait, psychoticism, would have a similar explanation. However, the causal properties of this state are not well defined. Eysenck has suggested that psychoticism is related to testosterone levels and is an inverse function of the serotonergic system, but he later revised this, linking it instead to the dopaminergic system.|$|E
