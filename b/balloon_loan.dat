In the UK, a partial repayment mortgage is quite common, especially where the original mortgage was investment-backed.|$|E

Kevin O'Leary offered Maneesh $500,000 for 3.14% of Pavlok {{by way of}} a 2 year <b>balloon</b> <b>loan</b> at 7.5%. This was a surprisingly great offer from Mr. Wonderful that shocked the other sharks. Maneesh refused to take Kevin's offer because he would not rather work with him. Kevin told Maneesh to [...] "Get the f**k out of here... f**k you.".|$|E
5000|$|A {{balloon payment}} {{mortgage}} is a mortgage {{which does not}} fully amortize over the term of the note, thus leaving a balance due at maturity. [...] The final payment is called a balloon payment because of its large size. Balloon payment mortgages are more common in commercial real estate than in residential real estate. A balloon payment mortgage may have a fixed or a floating interest rate. The most common way of describing a <b>balloon</b> <b>loan</b> uses the terminology X due in Y, where X {{is the number of}} years over which the loan is amortized, and Y is the year in which the principal balance is due.|$|E

50|$|Billionaires in Russia and Ukraine {{have been}} {{particularly}} hard-hit by lenders seeking repayment on <b>balloon</b> <b>loans</b> in order to shore up their own balance sheets. Many oligarchs took out generous loans from Russian banks, bought shares, and then took out more loans from western banks against {{the value of these}} shares. One of the first to get hit by the global downturn was Oleg Deripaska, Russia's richest man at the time, who had a net worth of US$28 billion in March 2008. As Deripaska borrowed money from western banks using shares in his companies as collateral, the collapse in share price forced him to sell holdings to satisfy the margin calls.|$|R
5000|$|S&Ls, on {{the other}} hand, tended to offer 11 to 12 year fully amortizing mortgages, and would {{generally}} write mortgages with loan-to-value ratios well in excess of 50%. [...] Borrowers thus faced a decision: accept high payments in return for eventual outright ownership or preference short-term well-being over formal home ownership. Many adopted a hybrid, financing 50% {{of the purchase price}} (less down payment) with an interest-only <b>balloon</b> <b>loan</b> and covering the remainder with an amortizing mortgage from a thrift, eventually financing the obligation at maturity of the former (perhaps after rolling it over for several periods) with an amortizing loan, and in so doing extending the term to maturity of this hybrid {{while at the same time}} putting forth a smaller down payment (the combined value of the mortgages exceeds an individual mortgage that and individual would qualify for). This hybrid was termed the “Philadelphia Plan” by W. N. Loucks in 1928 in reference to where its use first became widespread.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2014, the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned Wonga {{from using}} a TV advert that it said {{breached}} its code {{because of a}} claim that customers would save money. The authority said this {{was likely to be}} interpreted as a statement that Wonga’s loans were cheaper than those of other lenders and was therefore a price comparison. It ruled that Wonga should consequently have informed consumers of its 5,853% annual interest rate. The ruling was in response to a complaint from the charity Citizens Advice, whose chief executive Gillian Guy, said: [...] "Adverts must be clear about what taking out a loan means and how much it will cost. The consequences are really serious when payday lending goes wrong. High interest rates and fees can mean that a small <b>loan</b> <b>balloons</b> into a huge debt… both the advertising and payday loan industries need to look at why so many adverts are not meeting the grade and change their ways". It was the third Wonga advert to be banned by the ASA in 2014.|$|R
