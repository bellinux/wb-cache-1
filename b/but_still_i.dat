500|$|... "Beauty Mark" [...] is an ode to Wainwright's mother, {{the title}} {{referring}} to the mole above her lip. The song {{is one of the}} few up-tempo tracks on the album and contains multiple keyboard overdubs by Brion. Chris Yurkiw of the Montreal Mirror considered the track to be the most moving love song on the album, with an [...] "overt and open-hearted" [...] reference to his homosexuality: [...] "I may not be so manly, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>I</b> know you love me." [...] Wainwright's Summer Stage performance of [...] "Beauty Mark" [...] appears on his 2005 DVD All I Want. In [...] "Barcelona", Wainwright recalls a love affair that took place in the city of the same name. The song is loosely about AIDS and contains the Italian language lyric [...] "Fuggi, regal fantasima", taken from Giuseppe Verdi's opera Macbeth. According to Wainwright, the line appears in a scene when [...] "Macbeth is going mad and sees the ghost, and in [...] mind the ghost was AIDS." [...] "Matinee Idol" [...] is about the rise and fall of an entertainment figure, inspired by the death of actor River Phoenix. According to Greenwald, the musical song has a [...] "1920s, cabaret musical feel". [...] "Damned Ladies" [...] is a slow ballad about the [...] "beloved yet doomed ladies of opera". Wainwright said the following of [...] "Damned Ladies", which contains references to nine opera heroines: [...] "In the song, I lament how these women are constantly dying brutal deaths, which I can see coming but cannot stop. It gets me every time." [...] Greenwald described [...] "Sally Ann" [...] as a 1920s love ballad of [...] "lost love and emotional regret". The melody in [...] "Imaginary Love", the album's closing track, contains sixth and major seventh chords.|$|E

He was [...] "deep in desolate thought that I would no more be able to see my beloved wife and children, since there was no alternative for me than to share the same destiny as the Titanic". [...] As the number of lifeboats remaining diminished rapidly, [...] "I tried to prepare myself for the last moment with no agitation, making up my mind not to leave anything disgraceful as a Japanese. <b>But</b> <b>still</b> <b>I</b> found myself looking for and waiting for any possible chance for survival." ...|$|E

In 1990, Fossella changed his voter registration from the Democratic Party to become the family's first Republican. [...] "I found myself voting more and more for Republicans," [...] he said in 1997. [...] "For the most part, my family reacted well. <b>But</b> <b>still,</b> <b>I</b> would love to have been a fly on the wall."
