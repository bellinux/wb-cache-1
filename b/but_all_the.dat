5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, the {{children}} were forced {{to go to church}} to pray, and were required to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that failed to do so were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> children feared Pulherija.|$|E
5|$|From the Székelys, {{continuing}} warfare demanded increased military service, and {{the royal}} administration imposed special taxes on them. Although {{the leaders of}} the Székely community were exempted from taxation in 1554, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> foot soldiers continued to be taxed, resulting in a double burden of military and monetary obligations for them. In 1562 many Székelys took up arms against John II Sigismund, but they were defeated. The Saxon towns continued to develop even in the years of upheaval. Their population, however, increased slowly, mainly {{as a consequence of the}} Saxons' traditional desire for segregation: even Hungarian craftsmen and merchants were prohibited from settling in their towns.|$|E
5|$|In 746, {{he moved}} to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his {{official}} career. He took the civil service exam a second time during the following year, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> candidates were failed by the prime minister (apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals). He never again attempted the examinations, instead petitioning the emperor directly in 751, 754 and probably again in 755. He married around 752, and by 757 the couple had had five children—three sons and two daughters—but one of the sons died in infancy in 755. From 754 he began to have lung problems (probably asthma), {{the first of a series}} of ailments which dogged him for the rest of his life. It was in that year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region.|$|E

5|$|The {{next season}} Vanderbilt tied Navy and met rival Sewanee, {{in a battle}} of the unbeaten for the mythical crown of the South, and won using a trick double-pass play. Sewanee led 12–11 with twelve minutes to play. At McGugin's signal, the Commodores went into a freakish {{formation}} in which Stein Stone remained at center <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other players shifted to his left. Quarterback Hugh Potts took the snap and lateraled the ball to Vaughn Blake, who lateraled it across to Bob Blake, who had lined up deep in punt formation, as Stone ran down the field. Blake completed a 35-yard pass to Stone who was inside the 5-yard line. Honus Craig ran it in to win the game. It was cited by journalist Grantland Rice as the greatest thrill he ever witnessed in his years of watching sports.|$|E

5|$|During {{the rule}} of the Aryacakravarti rulers, the laws {{governing}} the society was based on a compromise between a matriarchal system of society that seemed to have had deeper roots overlaid with a patriarchal system of governance. These laws seemed to have existed side by side as customary laws to be interpreted by the local Mudaliars. In some aspects such as in inheritance the similarity to Marumakattayam law of present-day Kerala and Aliyasanatana of modern Tulunadu was noted by later scholars. Further Islamic jurisprudence and Hindu laws of neighboring India also seemed to have affected the customary laws. These customary laws were later codified and put to print during the Dutch colonial rule as Thesavalamai in 1707. The rule under earlier customs seemed to have been females succeeded females. But when the structure of the society came to be based on patriarchal system, a corresponding rule was recognized, that males succeeded males. Thus, we see the devolution of muthusam (paternal inheritance) was on the sons, and the devolution of the chidenam (dowry or maternal inheritance) was on the females. Just as one dowried sister succeeded another, we had the corresponding rule that if one’s brother died instate, his properties devolved upon his brothers to the exclusion of his sisters. The reason being that in a patriarchal family each brother formed a family unit, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> brothers being agnates, when one of them died his property devolved upon his agnates.|$|E
5|$|In {{most species}} the sexes are separate, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{freshwater}} species are hermaphroditic. Nemerteans often have numerous temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), and build temporary gonoducts (ducts {{from which the}} ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, and others protect their eggs in various ways. The fertilized egg divides by spiral cleavage and grows by determinate development, in which {{the fate of a}} cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors in the process of division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or to form planuliform larvae, in which the larva's long axis {{is the same as the}} juvenile's. However, some form a pilidium larva, in which the developing juvenile has a gut which lies across the larva's body, and usually eats the remains of the larva when it emerges. The bodies of some species fragment readily, and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool had {{a chance}} to extend their lead in the 74th minute, but Gerrard was unable to score from a cross by Núñez, with his shot going wide of the Chelsea goal. Liverpool pressed forward and a sliding tackle from Chelsea captain John Terry {{prevented}} Baroš from shooting in the Chelsea penalty area. Chelsea were awarded a free-kick in the 79th minute which was taken by Ferreira, the ball was met by Gerrard who intended to head it clear, but scored an own goal after heading the ball into the Liverpool goal. The score was now 1–1. Chelsea made their final substitution following the goal, with Glen Johnson replacing Cole. Chelsea manager Mourinho was sent off following the goal for making a gesture towards the Liverpool fans. Chelsea nearly took the lead in the 82nd minute, but Duff's shot was saved by Dudek. Chelsea had a few chances to score in the following exchanges, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> efforts missed the Liverpool goal. Liverpool's only chance {{in the rest of the}} half fell to Baroš, but he also put his shot wide. With the scores at 1–1, following the end of 90 minutes the match went to extra time.|$|E

5|$|The Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelled the end {{for most}} of Somerset's cottage industries. Farming {{continued}} to flourish, however, and the Bath and West of England Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Arts, Manufactures and Commerce was founded in 1777 to improve farming methods. Despite this, 20 years later John Billingsley conducted {{a survey of the}} county's agriculture in 1795 and found that agricultural methods could still be improved. Coal mining was an important industry in north Somerset during the 18th and 19th centuries, and by 1800 it was prominent in Radstock. The Somerset Coalfield reached its peak production by the 1920s, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> pits have now been closed, the last in 1973. Most of the surface buildings have been removed, and apart from a winding wheel outside Radstock Museum, little evidence of their former existence remains. Further west, the Brendon Hills were mined for iron ore in the late 19th century; this was taken by the West Somerset Mineral Railway to Watchet Harbour for shipment to the furnaces at Ebbw Vale.|$|E
