5|$|In {{many animals}} {{of the deep}} sea, {{including}} several squid species, bacterial bioluminescence is used for camouflage by counterillumination, in which the animal matches the overhead environmental light as seen from <b>below.</b> <b>In</b> these animals, photoreceptors control the illumination to match {{the brightness of the}} background. These light organs are usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria. However, in one species, Euprymna scolopes, the bacteria are an integral component of the animal's light organ.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{letters or}} {{diacritics}} are added, removed or modified by the International Phonetic Association.

5|$|The carrier's crew {{suffered}} 811 fatalities, mainly {{among the}} aircraft mechanics and armorers stationed on the hangar decks and the ship's engineers, {{many of whom}} were trapped <b>below</b> <b>in</b> the boiler and engine rooms by uncontrolled fires raging on the decks above them. Twenty-one of the ship's aviators were killed. The loss of Kaga and the three other IJN carriers at Midway (Hiryū was also sunk during the battle), with their aircraft and veteran pilots, was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat in the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{observatory}} underwent major renovations and additions in 1956 and 1966 {{to accommodate}} the growing faculty (see architecture section <b>below).</b> <b>In</b> 1967, the 12inch telescope at the observatory made its last professional photometric observations.

The same year the observatory received recognition by the National Register of Historic Places, 1986, thousands gathered at the site to observe Comet Halley's journey into the inner solar system.|$|E
