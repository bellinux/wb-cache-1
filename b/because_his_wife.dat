5|$|At {{the time}} of the coup, Prince Paul was in Zagreb en route to a planned holiday in Brdo. On the morning of 27 March, Deputy Prime Minister Maček was {{informed}} of the coup and met Prince Paul at Zagreb's railway station to discuss the situation. Maček suggested that Paul stay in Zagreb, with the possibility of mobilizing army units in the Banovina of Croatia in his support. Prince Paul declined this offer, at least partially <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> Princess Olga and children remained in Belgrade. He reached the capital by train that evening and was immediately ordered to sign papers abolishing the regency. He was subsequently exiled to Greece.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Julian {{had written}} to the Glidden Company, a {{supplier}} of soybean oil products, to request a five-gallon sample of the oil to use as his {{starting point for the}} synthesis of human steroidal sex hormones (in part <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> was suffering from infertility). After receiving the request, W. J. O'Brien, a vice-president at Glidden, made a telephone call to Julian, offering him the position of director of research at Glidden's Soya Products Division in Chicago. He was very likely offered the job by O'Brien because he was fluent in German, and Glidden had just purchased a modern continuous countercurrent solvent extraction plant from Germany for the extraction of vegetable oil from soybeans for paints and other uses.|$|E

5|$|Seyfried {{appeared}} {{as the title}} character in the erotic thriller Chloe, theatrically released by Sony Pictures Classics on March 26, 2010. Chloe originally premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 2009. In the film, Seyfried's character is an escort/prostitute who is hired to test a husband, <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> feels that she cannot trust his fidelity. Chloe enjoyed commercial success and became director Atom Egoyan's biggest moneymaker ever. Seyfried's performance in the film also received favorable reviews from critics; it also helped her to gain industry acclaim and receive more opportunities to play more varied roles.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp {{probably}} {{held the}} office of royal forester for Worcestershire as well as sheriff. The evidence {{for this is that}} after Beauchamp's death, his son William was granted the revenues from the royal forests of Worcestershire {{at the same rate as}} his father had held them; this strongly implies that the elder held {{the office of}} forester. The historian Judith Green felt that Walter de Beauchamp might possibly have held the office of constable, which had been held by his father-in-law, although the historian C. Warren Hollister felt that Beauchamp definitely did hold the office. He also a held the royal office of dispenser, an office which later became known as a butler. He acquired this <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> inherited the office from her father. The date when he acquired the office is unknown. While a member of the royal household, Beauchamp witnessed a number of royal charters, mainly when the king was in England.|$|E
5|$|His goals {{also helped}} Darlington reach {{the second round}} proper (last 32) of the 1919–20 FA Cup. Healey scored twice against Bishop Auckland in the fifth {{qualifying}} round, and repeated the feat in the sixth, as well as creating two for Aaron Travis, as Darlington beat Southern League club Norwich City 5–0. In the first round proper, Darlington faced Sheffield Wednesday of the First Division. A damaged shoulder meant Healey was unfit for the scheduled date, but a waterlogged Feethams pitch gave him an extra few days to recover. The match ended goalless; Healey was unusually indecisive in front of goal, and was standing in an offside position when Travis did put {{the ball in the}} net. Although reported doubtful for the replay, he did appear, pressuring goalkeeper Arnold Birch into conceding a corner from which Darlington took the lead– the goal variously attributed to George Stevens or to Healey himself. He missed the second-round tie at Birmingham <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> was ill; Darlington lost 4–0.|$|E

5|$|Howard {{repeatedly}} questions Vaughn, {{believing he}} is {{acting as the}} fall guy for his two friends. Vaughn says nothing, but eventually writes a letter of apology to Ellison. Felton closes the case despite Howard's protests for more time to investigate. Vaughn eventually pleads guilty at his arraignment and insists on serving life without parole. Marvin and Tweety are sentenced to 30 years in prison, but Ellison tells Howard he feels no comfort <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> is still dead. Howard tries to give Vaughn's letter to Ellison, but he refuses to accept it. Howard eventually speaks directly to Vaughn in prison, where Vaughn admits he handled the gun during the stick-up because he thought {{if he had the}} gun, he could control the situation and prevent anyone from getting hurt. Vaughn said he lost control of the robbery, and insists he needs to serve the life sentence to make amends. A devastated Howard finally agrees with Felton's opinion that Vaughn was indeed the shooter.|$|E
5|$|Raynald {{was held}} in prison until 1176. After his release for a large ransom, he {{did not return to}} Antioch, <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> had {{meanwhile}} died. He married Stephanie of Milly, the wealthy heiress of Oultrejordain. Since Baldwin IV of Jerusalem also granted Hebron to him, Raynald was one of the wealthiest barons of the realm. He controlled the caravan routes between Egypt and Syria. Baldwin, who suffered from leprosy, made him regent in 1177. Raynald led the crusader army that defeated Saladin at the Battle of Montgisard. He was the only Christian leader to pursue an offensive policy against Saladin, making plundering raids against the caravans travelling near his domains. He built a fleet of five ships which plundered the coast of the Red Sea, threatening the route of the Muslim pilgrims towards Mecca in early 1183. Saladin pledged that he would never forgive Raynald.|$|E

AJ discovers that Masood and Zainab are divorced and later tells Masood he came to Walford <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> Aliyah (Ann Wenn) has left him. After Masood inspires AJ with his reunion with Zainab, AJ leaves to reconcile with his own wife. He returns a few weeks later saying that he and Aliyah are divorcing.

25|$|The family appealed, {{contrasting}} {{her case}} {{with that of}} Juan Lafuente, another possible victim whose petition the court's counterpart in Dutchess County, where he lived, had accepted. Like Philip, his exposure to the attacks is based on circumstantial evidence. He, too, had recently lost a job and struggled with depression, and as a volunteer fire marshal in Poughkeepsie might himself have had a reason to offer assistance at the attack site. His office was eight blocks north of the W.T.C. complex, but the court accepted testimony from someone who frequented the same local deli claiming he had overheard Lafuente say he had {{a meeting at the}} Trade Center that morning. Philip's family believes Lafuente's petition, with similarly minimal evidence of the alleged decedent's presence {{at the site of the}} attacks, was accepted primarily <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> Colette, was mayor of Poughkeepsie at the time and the case was heard there rather than in Manhattan.|$|E
