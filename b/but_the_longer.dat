5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E
25|$|Like most Germanic languages, Dutch forms noun compounds, {{where the}} first noun modifies the {{category}} given by the second (hondenhok = doghouse). Unlike English, where newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in open form with separating spaces, Dutch (like the other Germanic languages) either uses the closed form without spaces (boomhut = tree house) or inserts a hyphen (VVD-coryfee = outstanding member of the VVD, a political party). Like German, Dutch allows arbitrarily long compounds, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> they get, the less frequent they tend to be.|$|E
25|$|By June, Carter had the {{nomination}} sufficiently locked up and could {{take time to}} interview potential vice-presidential candidates. The pundits predicted that Church would be tapped to provide balance as an experienced senator with strong liberal credentials. Church promoted himself, persuading friends to intervene with Carter in his behalf. If a quick choice had been required as in past conventions, Carter later recalled, he would probably have chosen Church. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> period for deliberation gave Carter time to worry about his compatibility with the publicity-seeking Church, who {{had a tendency to}} be long-winded. Instead, Carter invited Senators Edmund Muskie, John Glenn, and Walter Mondale to visit his home in Plains, Georgia, for personal interviews, while Church, Henry M. Jackson, and Adlai Stevenson III would be interviewed at the convention in New York. Of all the potential candidates, Carter found Mondale the most compatible. As a result, Carter selected Mondale as his running mate.|$|E

500|$|The {{commander}} of Fort Lipantitlán, Nicolás Rodríguez, {{had been ordered}} to harass the Texian troops at Goliad. [...] Rodríguez took {{the bulk of his}} men on an expedition; while they were gone, Westover's force arrived in San Patricio. [...] On November 3, a local man persuaded the Mexican garrison to surrender, and the following day the Texians dismantled the fort. Rodríguez returned as the Texians were crossing the swollen Nueces River to return to Goliad.

2500|$|The {{rebuilding}} {{work was}} resumed in 1956 {{and the new}} station with its large office block, 'Intercity House', was formally opened by Dr Richard Beeching, the British Railways Chairman, on 26 March 1962. The office block {{was intended to be}} the northern point of Armada Way, counterbalancing the tower of the Civic Centre at the southern end, in the Abercrombie/Paton-Watson 'Plan for Plymouth'. [...] The station now had seven through platforms, although two of these were converted to terminal bay platforms in 1974. [...] One of these at the west end is usually used for the Tamar Valley Line service <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> east end bays were used for parcels and for Royal Mail trains until the withdrawal of this traffic from the area in 2003. [...] Outside the station a car park was provided, which was rebuilt in its current multistorey form in the 1970s. In recent times there have been updates to the station.|$|E
2500|$|High-intensity {{discharge}} (HID) {{lights were}} the brightest lights available for bicycles until recently eclipsed by the advances in LED lights. [...] They are very efficient, very bright, but expensive. They {{also tend to}} have high power consumption (although they use less power than halogens for higher output), so a relatively limited burn time. Otherwise {{they have the same}} advantages and disadvantages as rechargeable halogen systems, and like halogen systems they are designed primarily for off-road use, having rotationally symmetrical beams which cast as much light up as down. [...] An additional disadvantage compared with halogen or LED lights is that the HID lamp does not tolerate repeated strikes, and in many cases does not relight immediately after shutting down. [...] Likewise, should the battery level fall too low, the lamp will shut down rather than dimming. [...] <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> battery life than halogens tends to negate these problems, as many riders simply switch the light on and leave it running throughout the ride.|$|E

2500|$|Chief Constable is {{the title}} of the head of each United Kingdom {{territorial}} police force except the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police, which are headed by commissioners. Ranks above Chief Superintendent are usually non-operational management roles, and are often referred to as [...] "Chief Officer" [...] ranks <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> phrase [...] "chief police officer" [...] or similar in legislation is specifically a commissioner or chief constable, a [...] "senior police officer" [...] being their immediate deputy. The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police is often considered to be the highest police rank within the United Kingdom, although in reality every Chief Constable and the two Commissioners are supreme over their own forces and are not answerable to any other officer; there is also the matter that (in the absence of mutual aid arrangements and similar) a police officer of any rank only holds the office of constable in any of the three UK national jurisdiction(s) in which he/she has been attested thus implicitly limiting any general comparison or ranking to a chief police officer's home jurisdiction.|$|E

The day ended with a cover of [...] "Twist and Shout", {{which had to be}} recorded last because John Lennon had a particularly bad cold and Martin feared the throat-shredding vocal would ruin Lennon's voice for the day. This performance, caught on the first take, prompted Martin to say: [...] "I don't know how they do it. We've been recording all day <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> we go on the better they get." [...] Mark Lewisohn would later write: [...] "There can scarcely have been 585 more productive minutes in the history of recorded music" [...] Paul McCartney double tracked his vocal on [...] "A Taste of Honey" [...] and Lennon added harmonica onto [...] "There's a Place" [...] during these sessions.
