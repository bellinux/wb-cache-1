40|$|The {{robustness}} of hydrological {{models is}} determined by issues such as model performance under different calibration and validation conditions, extrapolation behaviour and propagation of uncertainties. Different conditions are commonly expressed by different objective functions such as the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient and the {{root mean square error}} of peak flows. These different objective functions can be combined into multi-objective functions for calibration purposes. However, it is generally not known which balance between different objectives should be used, i. e. which weights should be assigned to the different objective functions. Most multi-objective approaches in the literature assume a certain <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>objectives</b> depending on the simulation purpose of the model user. An alternative way is to assess the optimum balance based on an aggregated measure, for instance a fuzzy measure or a scaled multi-objective function. This avoids the selection of weights and makes the process less subjective. In this study, three different measures to assess the optimal <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>objectives</b> are compared: combined rank method, parameter identifiability and model evaluation. Four objectives (water balance, hydrograph, high flows, low flows) are included in each measure. The contributions of these objectives to the specific measure are varied to find the optimal balance between the objectives for each measure. The methods are applied to nine middle-sized catchments (350 - 2500 km 2) and using a typical conceptual hydrological model. Results indicate that differences in the optimal balance between the combined rank method and parameter identifiability {{on the one hand and}} model evaluation on the other hand are considerable. The theoretically optimal balance would be a situation without trade-off between single objectives. For some catchments and measures, this situation is almost obtained. On average, the combined rank method’s performance is somewhat better than the parameter identifiability’s performance (respectively 3. 6 % and 5. 0 % from theoretical optimum), where the model evaluation’s performance is considerably less (22. 4 % from theoretical optimu...|$|E

40|$|The {{economic}} viability of a manufacturing organization {{depends on its}} ability to maximize customer services; maintain efficient, low-cost operations; and minimize total investment. These objectives conflict with one another and, thus, are difficult to achieve on an operational basis. Much of the work in the area of automated scheduling systems recognizes this problem but does not address it effectively. The work presented by this Ph.

It is argued that to achieve the required <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>objectives,</b> a scheduling system must have the ability to relate the consequence of a decision to the satisfaction of overall objectives. The dissertation introduces the concept of a preference capacity plan (PCP) in an attempt to give automated schedulers this ability.

40|$|Syfte: Tidigare forskning tyder på att Balanced Scorecard handlar om att skapa balans mellan finansiella och icke-finansiella mål, medan andra menar att det handlar om balans mellan ägarnas och intressenternas mål. Vårt syfte med studien är därför att öka förståelsen för hur balans skapas mellan olika mål, med fokus på Balanced Scorecard i offentlig sektor. Metod: Denna kvalitativa studie bygger på en hermeneutisk och socialkonstruktivistisk ansats. Den teoretiska referensramen bygger på tidigare forskning inom delämnet och empiri samlas in genom semistrukturerade intervjuer. Genom en abduktiv ansats vägs teori och empiri mot varandra för att öka förståelsen. Analysen sorteras efter de teman som uppkommer i studien. Resultat & slutsats: Vår studie tyder på att det inte finns någon konflikt mellan ägarnas och intressenternas mål i offentlig sektor. Verksamheter i den offentliga sektorn har istället konflikter mellan finansiella och icke-finansiella mål, där fokus ligger i att få resurserna att räcka till för att uppnå andra mål. Förslag till vidare forskning: Trots att det finns mycket forskning kring Balanced Scorecard, ser vi ändå ett behov att studera fenomenet balans vidare. Antingen i en djupare jämförande studie där konceptet i den offentliga sektorn jämförs med den privata sektorn, alternativt i en studie som belyser medarbetares attityder till Balanced Scorecard och målstyrning. Uppsatsens bidrag: Det teoretiska bidraget innefattar en ökad förståelse kring balansen mellan olika mål formulerade i Balanced Scorecard, där fokus i den offentliga sektorn ligger i att tydligt synliggöra finansiella och icke-finansiella mål. Det praktiska bidraget innefattar en ökad förståelse för de verksamheter vi studerar över vilken balans som eftersträvas i deras verksamheter, men ger också en inblick för liknande organisationer i offentlig sektor. Aim: Previous {{research}} suggests that the Balanced Scorecard is about creating a balance between financial and non-financial objectives, while others believe that it is about the balance between owners and stakeholders objectives. Our purpose in this study is therefore to increase understanding of how to create balance between different objectives, with a focus on the Balanced Scorecard in the public sector. Method: This qualitative study is based on a hermeneutic and social constructivist approach. The theoretical framework builds on previous research in the field and empirical data is collected through semi-structured interviews. Through an abductive process, theory and empirical data is weighed against each other to increase understanding. The analysis is sorted by the themes that arise in the study. Result & Conclusions: Our study suggests that there is no conflict between the owners and stakeholders goals in the public sector. Businesses with no explicit profit-making purpose has a conflict between financial and non-financial objectives instead, where focus is in getting the resources to be sufficient to achieve their other objectives. Suggestions for future research: Although there is much research on the Balanced Scorecard, we still see a need to further study the phenomenon of balance. Either a deeper comparative study of the concept in where the public sector is compared with the private sector, alternatively a study that highlights employees' attitudes to the Balanced Scorecard and performance management.

In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), this focus has prompted practitioners to search for outcome measures that can objectively verify the effectiveness of TCM interventions, especially {{in the context of}} randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Commonly used indexes for outcome assessment in RCTs of TCM can be categorized into two types: TCM-specific outcomes such as tongue and pulse characteristics, and Western medicine (WM) -specific outcomes such as blood test and X-ray examination results. Some studies include both types of indicators. During the trial design, it is necessary to consider the rationales of selecting outcome assessments, the purpose and study approach, <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> <b>objective</b> and subjective indexes, standardization of outcome assessment, and standardized outcome indexes. We recommend to report the outcome assessment in RCTs of TCM in the following format: 1) identifying the primary and secondary outcomes based on the purpose and hypothesis of the trial; 2) defining the primary and secondary outcomes clearly; 3) presenting the rationale of selection; 4) presenting the method with aims to standardize the assessment process; 5) presenting the method to improve the reliability of assessment; and 6) stating the termination criteria in the trial...|$|R
