5|$|In {{his first}} season at Massillon, Brown's team posted a 5–4–1 record, better than the {{previous}} year <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> Brown's exacting standards. The Tigers improved again in 1933, ending with an 8–2 record but losing to their chief rivals, the Canton McKinley High School Bulldogs. In 1934, Massillon won all of its games until a 21–6 defeat to Canton in {{the final game of}} the season. As the pressure on Brown grew to turn the tables on Canton, Massillon finally accomplished the feat the following year in an undefeated season, the first of several with Brown at the helm.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} World War I {{there were}} no traditions of nationally commemorating mass {{casualties}} in war. France and Germany had been relatively recently involved in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 to 1871. Germany had built a number of national war memorials commemorating their victory, usually focusing on celebrating their military leaders. In France, memorials to their losses were relatively common, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> being a national response, and many towns and villages did not erect memorials at all. A new organisation, the Souvenir Français, {{was established in the}} 1880s to protect French war memorials and encourage young French people to engage in military activities; the organisation grew to have many contacts in local government by 1914.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} sound film {{released}} by Tan's, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> {{the first in the}} Indies. The earliest sound films released in the Indies, Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 and The Rainbow Man, were both shown in 1929. The following year, a domestic part-talkie, G. Krugers' Karnadi Anemer Bangkong, was also released, becoming the first domestic sound film. Two other directors had followed with full-talkies in 1931: The Teng Chun with Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang and the Wong brothers with Indonesia Malaise. In order to ensure the quality of the sound, Tan's hired Krugers and his single-system camera to do the cinematography and sound direction for this black-and-white film.|$|E

However Cassini, Rømer's superior at the Royal Observatory, was an early and tenacious opponent of Rømer's ideas, and it seems that Picard, Rømer's mentor, shared many of Cassini's doubts.|$|E

Tourville pursued, but instead of {{ordering}} a general chase, he maintained the strict line-of-battle, reducing the speed of the fleet to that of the slower ships. Torrington burnt six more badly-damaged Dutch ships (Noorderkwartier, Gekroonde Burg, Maagd van Enkhuizen, Elswout, Tholen and the fireship Maagd van Enkhuizen) and one English ship (the third rate 70-gun Anne) to avoid their capture before gaining the refuge of the Thames. The Wapen van Utrecht sank by herself. As soon as Torrington was in the safety of the river, he ordered all the navigation buoys removed, making any attempt to follow him too dangerous.|$|E
25|$|In drawing {{attention}} {{to a number of}} preliminary studies, the so-called primary project, that show an atelier installation incorporating the central triangular shape which reappears in the final version of Guernica, Becht-Jördens and Wehmeier interpret the painting as a self-referential composition in the tradition of atelier paintings such as Las Meninas by Diego Velázquez. In his chef d'oeuvre, Picasso seems to be trying to define his role and his power as an artist in the face of political power and violence. <b>But</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> being a mere political painting, Guernica should be seen as Picasso’s comment on what art can actually contribute towards the self-assertion that liberates every human being and protects the individual against overwhelming forces such as political crime, war, and death.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, the British {{had three}} {{infantry}} battalions in Sudan and the SDF, which had 4,500 men in 21 companies, the best-equipped being Motor Machine-Gun companies, with light machine-guns mounted in vans, lorries {{and a few}} locally made armoured cars; the Sudan Horse was converting to a 3.7-inch mountain howitzer battery. Platt held Khartoum with 2nd Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment, the 1st Battalion, Essex Regiment at Atbara and the 1st Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment at Gebeit and Port Sudan. The SDF garrisoned the frontier with the provincial police and a motley of irregular scouts to watch, harass and delay the Italians. Should the Italians invade, the units would converge against the attackers, exploit distance, the inadequate roads and supply difficulties, to impede their advance. The Royal Air Force (RAF) had three bomber squadrons, K Flight, 112 Squadron, with six Gladiator fighters at Port Sudan and 430 Flight, 47 Squadron for army co-operation. The aircraft were convenient for Port Sudan and the Red Sea <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> Kassala and Gedaref.

Last <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> least, Busby Berkeley would surely have been delighted to see his influence extending to the climactic drum dance." ...|$|E
500|$|Crime, usually murder, is {{an element}} of almost all films noir; in {{addition}} to standard-issue greed, jealousy is frequently the criminal motivation. A crime investigation—by a private eye, a police detective (sometimes acting alone), or a concerned amateur—is the most prevalent, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> dominant, basic plot. In other common plots the protagonists are implicated in heists or con games, or in murderous conspiracies often involving adulterous affairs. False suspicions and accusations of crime are frequent plot elements, as are betrayals and double-crosses. According to J. David Slocum, [...] "protagonists assume the literal identities of dead men in nearly fifteen percent of all noir." [...] Amnesia is fairly epidemic—"noir's version of the common cold", in the words of film historian Lee Server.|$|E

500|$|In 1861, the Civil War {{began as}} eleven Southern states seceded from the Union {{to form the}} Confederate States of America. Randall joined the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry in May of that year as a private. The unit was {{stationed}} in central Pennsylvania and eastern Virginia during Randall's 90-day enlistment, but saw no action during that time. In 1863, he re-joined the unit, this time being elected captain. The First Troop {{was sent back to}} central Pennsylvania during the Gettysburg campaign that summer, when Confederate forces under Robert E. Lee invaded Pennsylvania. He served as provost marshal at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania {{in the days before the}} battle there, and had the same role at Columbia, Pennsylvania during the battle, but did not see combat. As historian Albert V. House explained, [...] "is military career was respectable, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> arduous, most of his duties being routine reconnoitering which seldom led him under fire." ...|$|E
500|$|Terlecki openly {{participated in}} students' strikes {{at his old}} {{university}} in Łódź and across Poland {{over the next few}} months, providing food to the students by the car-load. ŁKS cancelled his registration in early 1981. Majchrzak stresses that Terlecki was the only player involved in the incident not to regain his place in the Poland team, and claims that this was down to an intense grudge held against him by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Secret Police (SB). Terlecki developed his own theory that the media circus following the airport incident had been deliberately engineered by the SB to head the players off forming their own trade union. There were several other incidents of drunkenness involving Młynarczyk, Majchrzak writes, but this was the only occasion when any player was punished for it. In October 1981, when the team travelled to Argentina, Młynarczyk arrived at Okęcie [...] "completely drunk", according to Iwan, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> reprimanding him, team staff gave him even more alcohol during the flight to help ease the pain of his broken finger.|$|E
500|$|When a {{group of}} about 50 ZANU–PF activists briefly invaded Gwenoro in May 2000, Smith played down the incident, saying the intruders were just bored and out of work. [...] "There's no {{politics}} on the farm," [...] he said. Five months later, in England to address the Oxford Union, Smith described Mugabe as [...] "mentally deranged". The President announced in response that Smith would be arrested and tried for genocide if he ever came back to Zimbabwe, a threat that Smith mocked. [...] "I would love that. Let him try it," [...] he said—"It would give me the chance to tell the world the truth about this gangster... I will give him the date and time of arrival of my plane so he can meet me at the airport." [...] A mass of reporters descended on Harare International Airport on 7 November 2000 to witness Smith's arrest, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> being detained, the former Prime Minister was greeted cheerily by immigration officers and allowed through without any obstruction. Telling the waiting pressmen that he was disappointed not to have met any confrontation, he commented: [...] "We have a president here who is mentally unstable and makes statements that have no bearing on reality", and went home unmolested.|$|E

500|$|The episode has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote, [...] "One of those shows that people always talk about when discussing The Simpsons– and rightfully so. Homer's transformation from angry parent to sensible, calm husband is excellent, as is his reaction to Bart posting his angry letter. Their attempts to retrieve the letter and Burns' eventual reaction are fabulous." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: 'In many ways, [...] "Feud" [...] seemed more derivative than usual. Not only did it resemble parts of [...] "Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish", but Homer’s attempts to regain the letter before Burns reads it appear reminiscent of an episode of The Flintstones. Despite those similarities, [...] "Feud" [...] still provided a very entertaining show. The program packed in a slew of hilarious moments, from Homer’s description of a Bible story to {{his visit to the}} post office.' A reviewer for DVDTown gave the episode a grade of C, describing it as [...] "a fun episode, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> great." [...] Ben Rayner of The Toronto Star included [...] "Blood Feud" [...] in his list of the top ten episodes of The Simpsons, noting that [...] "Homer's efforts to thwart the mail service still kill me 15 years later." ...|$|E
500|$|Mick LaSalle gave {{a largely}} {{negative}} review. [...] "A.I. exhibits all its creators' bad traits {{and none of}} the good. So we end up with the structureless, meandering, slow-motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy, cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg." [...] Dubbing it Spielberg's [...] "first boring movie", LaSalle also believed the robots {{at the end of the}} film were aliens, and compared Gigolo Joe to the [...] "useless" [...] Jar Jar Binks, yet praised Robin Williams for his portrayal of a futuristic Albert Einstein. Peter Travers gave a mixed review, concluding [...] "Spielberg cannot live up to Kubrick's darker side of the future." [...] But he still put the film on his top ten list that year for best movies. David Denby in The New Yorker criticized A.I. for not adhering closely to his concept of the Pinocchio character. Spielberg responded to some of the criticisms of the film, stating that many of the [...] "so called sentimental" [...] elements of A.I., including the ending, were in fact Kubrick's and the darker elements were his own. However, Sara Maitland, who worked on the project with Kubrick in the 1990s, claimed that one of the reasons Kubrick never started production on A.I. was because he had a hard time making the ending work. James Berardinelli found the film [...] "consistently involving, with moments of near-brilliance, <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> a masterpiece. In fact, as the long-awaited 'collaboration' of Kubrick and Spielberg, it ranks as something of a disappointment." [...] Of the film's highly debated finale, he claimed, [...] "There is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all Spielberg; the outstanding question is where Kubrick's vision left off and Spielberg's began." ...|$|E

Blender reporter Jon Dolan claims that Allen [...] "deploys a sugary melody as a Trojan horse for a smackdown on a douche-bag ex-boyfriend", as Rob Webb from Drowned in Sound called [...] "Smile" [...] an [...] "infectious slice of bouncing, carnival reggae that punches hard with its opening line: 'When you first left me / I was wanting more / But you were fucking that girl next door / What you do that for?,'" [...] and {{went on to say that}} the theme of the song is melancholy, [...] "set against breezy beats", and while not being [...] "an obvious TOTP contender on the surface, [...] is good <b>but</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> one of the LP's choice cuts". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone gave a rather negative review, claiming the singer [...] "doesn't sound as if she's trying too hard", singing the song with a [...] "breezy sha-la-la lilt that just made the song seem even nastier". Later, he called Allen a [...] "theoretical pop princess, who just entered the breakup-song hall of fame". Dom Passantino of Stylus suggested that [...] "'Smile' gets burned off the lights by both Sean Paul and Abs when it comes to facsimiles of 'Uptown Top Ranking,' but neither of them could bring the quality of lyricism the singer does," [...] while Slant Magazine reporter Sal Cinquemani was baffled as to why the song, which she [...] "sings without a smirk of irony", is a UK chart-topper.|$|E
