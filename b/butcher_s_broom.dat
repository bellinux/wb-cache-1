Tendril-less regulates tendril {{formation}} in pea leaves. Plant Cell, 21 (2), 420 - 428. Tendrils are contact-sensitive, filamentous organs that permit climbing plants to tether to their taller neighbors. Tendrilled legume species are grown as field crops, where the tendrils {{contribute to the}} physical support of the crop prior to harvest. The homeotic tendril-less (tl) mutation in garden pea (Pisum sativum), identified almost a century ago, transforms tendrils into leaflets. In this study, we used a systematic marker screen of fast neutron?generated tl deletion mutants to identify Tl as a Class I homeodomain leucine zipper (HDZIP) transcription factor. We confirmed the tendril-less phenotype as loss of function by targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING) in garden pea and by analysis of the tendril-less phenotype of the t mutant in sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus). The conversion of tendrils into leaflets in both mutants demonstrates that the pea tendril is a modified leaflet, inhibited from completing laminar development by Tl. We provide {{evidence to show that}} lamina inhibition requires Unifoliata/LEAFY-mediated Tl expression in organs emerging in the distal region of the leaf primordium. Phylogenetic analyses show that Tl is an unusual Class I HDZIP protein and that tendrils evolved either once or twice in Papilionoid legumes. We suggest that tendrils arose in the Fabeae clade of Papilionoid legumes through acquisition of the Tl gene. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2001 Academic Press. All rights reserved. A mutant form of {{the common}} beta-subunit of the GM-CSF, interleukin- 3 (IL 3) and IL 5 receptors is {{activated}} by a 37 residue duplicated segment which includes the WSXWS motif and an adjacent, highly conserved, aliphatic/basic element. Haemopoietic expression of this mutant, hbeta(c) FIDelta, in mice leads to myeloproliferative disease. To examine the mechanism of activation of this mutant we targetted the two conserved motifs in each repeat for mutagenesis. Here we show that this mutant exhibits constitutive activity in BaF-B 03 cells {{in the presence of}} mouse or human GM-CSF receptor alpha-subunit (GMRalpha) and this activity is disrupted by mutations of the conserved motifs in the first repeat. In the presence of these mutations the receptor reverts to an alternative conformation which retains responsiveness to human IL 3 in a CTLL cell line co-expressing the human IL 3 receptor alpha-subunit (hIL 3 Ralpha). Remarkably, the activated conformation is maintained in the presence of substitutions, deletions or replacement of the second repeat. This suggests that activation occurs due to insertion of extra sequence after the WSXWS motif and is not dependent on the length or specific sequence of the insertion. Thus hbeta(c) displays an ability to fold into functional receptor conformations given insertion of up to 37 residues in the membrane-proximal region. Constitutive activation most likely results from a specific conformational change which alters a dormant, inactive receptor complex, permitting functional association with GMRalpha and ligand-independent mitogenic signalling.

40|$|While still {{a medical}} student in Scotland in the late 1880 <b>s,</b> Robert <b>Broom</b> had already {{identified}} the principal aim of his scientific career as being ‘to {{solve the problem of}} the origin of the mammals’. In Australia, between 1892 and 1896, his work on extant and fossil marsupials and monotremes established that, contrary to the then prevailing scientific opinion which supported a polyphyletic origin for mammals from a diverse range of amphibians and reptiles, the most important living class had been monophyletically derived, most likely from a lineage of Karoo therapsid reptiles. Later, on a trip to the United States in 1909 / 10 he revived the theory which proposed the existence of a close relationship between the South African therapsids and the Permian ‘pelycosaur’ reptiles of North America. The third, and most extensive element of Broom’s task was carried out almost exclusively in South Africa over a period spanning {{more than half a century}} during which he created 369 therapsid holotypes, 168 of which were allocated to new genera.

50|$|The {{company began}} in 1867 as the William Butcher Steel Works. The {{products}} that founders William Butcher, Jr. (a {{son of the}} founder of W. & <b>S.</b> <b>Butcher</b> Steel Works, a scion of the Sheffield, England steel industry) and Philip Syng Justice (an American manufacturer) planned to produce were cast-steel locomotive tires (that is, in British spelling, tyres) and cast-steel forgings, {{with a plan to}} make eventually a promising new product: steel rails, which would be far superior to older iron ones. At about this time in nearby Bethlehem, the predecessor company of Bethlehem Steel was also getting into the steel rail business. The Nicetown site was chosen because plenty of the anthracite coal that moved by river, canal, and rail from northeast Pennsylvania passed by Nicetown on its way to Port Richmond. Anthracite was superior to bituminous coal for steelmaking. Nicetown's proximity to one of the principal locomotive-building plants of the western hemisphere, the Baldwin Locomotive Works (which at the time was just a few rail-served miles away in the Spring Garden neighborhood), was another benefit of the site.|$|R
40|$|This article {{frames the}} intersections of {{medicine}} and humanities as intrinsic to understanding the practice {{of health care in}} Africa. Central to this manuscript, which draws on empirical findings on the interplay between HIV and AIDS and alternative medicine in Zimbabwe is the realisation that very limited research has been undertaken to examine ‘HIV/AIDS patient behaviour’ with respect to choice of therapy on the continent [Bene, M. & Darkoh, M. B. K. (2014). The Constraints of Antiretroviral Uptake in Rural Areas: The Case of Thamaga and Surrounding Villages, Botswana. SAHARA-J: Journal of Social Aspects of HIV/AIDS, 11 (1), 167 – 177. doi: 10. 1080 / 17290376. 2014. 972057; Chavunduka, G. (1998). Professionalisation of Traditional Medicine in Zimbabwe, Harare, Jongwe Printers; O’Brien, <b>S.</b> & <b>Broom,</b> A. (2014).

As such, a social approach to health-seeking behaviour questions how decisions about alternative therapies including herbal remedies, traditional healing and faith healing are made. The paper unpacks the realities around how people living with HIV and AIDS – who span different age groups and profess various religious backgrounds, faced with an insurmountable health challenge against a background of limited resources and no cure for the virus – often experience shifts in health-seeking behaviour. Grappling with seemingly simple questions about ‘when, where and how to seek medical attention’, the paper provides pointers to therapy choices and health-seeking behaviour; and it serves as a route into deeper and intense healthcare practice explorations. In conclusion, the paper proposes that medicine and the humanities should engage seriously with those social aspects of HIV and AIDS which call for an integrated approach to healthcare practice in Africa. If combined, medicine and the humanities might achieve what neither would alone...|$|R

The future is a global voyage into the art and science of communication, where the successful communicator will be like {{the men and women}} of the Renaissance, pulling it all together, but in the high tech environment of the 21 st century. ” (pp. 10 - 11) Since the 1980 <b>s,</b> starting from <b>Broom</b> and Dozier’s seminal studies on the nature of public relations employment and professionalism, there has been discussion of the career paths, competencies and training needs of public relations and corporate communication professionals. More recently, the Arthur W. Page Society (2007) has scoped the role of the Chief Communication Officer’s role in the Authentic Enterprise which placed the communicator at C-Level (Executive Board) or close to it (the marzipan layer) of the corporation. The research to be reported in this paper analyses the responses of leading European and international senior-level communicators as to the knowledge, skills, relationships, 360 -degree vision, and managerial abilities that senior communications professionals will need in five years’ time, and what it takes to prepare the next generation of leaders in globally integrated organizations. The paper will also reflect on recent academic and practice literature about the nature of these competencies and discusses the potential methods and routes of their delivery. It will also consider the current operating situation, the challenges facing senior corporate communicators and their future needs. The outcomes will include recommendations for consideration by educators and employers, especially those operating in cross-cultural environments. ...|$|R
40|$|The Echoplanar Imaging Thrombolysis Evaluation Trial (EPITHET) {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) -diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) mismatch predicts the response to thrombolysis. There is no accepted standardized definition of PWI-DWI mismatch. We compared common mismatch definitions in the initial 40 EPITHET patients. Raw perfusion images were used to generate maps of time to peak (TTP), mean transit time (MTT), time to peak of the impulse response (Tmax) and first moment transit time (FMT). DWI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and PWI volumes were measured with planimetric and thresholding techniques. Correlations between mismatch volume (PWIvol-DWIvol) and DWI expansion (T 2 (Day 90 -vol) -DWI(Acute-vol)) were also assessed. Mean age was 68 +/- 11, time to MRI 4. 5 +/- 0. 7 hours, and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 11 (range 4 to 23). Tmax and MTT hypoperfusion volumes were significantly lower than those calculated with TTP and FMT maps (P or = 20 % was observed in 89 % (Tmax) to 92 % (TTP/FMT/MTT) of patients. Application of a + 4 s (relative to the contralateral hemisphere) PWI threshold reduced the frequency of positive mismatch volumes (TTP 73 %/FMT 68 %/Tmax 54 %/MTT 43 %). Mismatch was not significantly different when assessed with ADC maps. Mismatch volume, calculated with all parameters and thresholds, was not significantly correlated with DWI expansion. In contrast, reperfusion was correlated inversely with infarct growth (R=- 0. 51; P= 0. 009). Deconvolution and application of PWI thresholds provide more conservative estimates of tissue at risk and decrease the frequency of mismatch accordingly. The precise definition may not be critical; however, because reperfusion alters tissue fate irrespective of mismatch. K. <b>S.</b> <b>Butcher,</b> M. Parsons, L. MacGregor, P. A. Barber, J. Chalk, C.

40|$|Visual clutter {{concerns}} {{designers of}} user interfaces and information visualizations. This should not surprise visual perception researchers because excess and/or disorganized display items can cause crowding, masking, decreased recognition performance due to occlusion, greater difficulty at both segmenting a scene and performing visual search, and so on. Given a reliable {{measure of the}} visual clutter in a display, designers could optimize display clutter. Furthermore, a measure of visual clutter could help generalize models like Guided Search (J. M. Wolfe, 1994) by providing a substitute for “set size ” more easily computable on more complex and natural imagery. In this article, we present and test several measures of visual clutter, which operate on arbitrary images as input. The first is {{a new version of}} the Feature Congestion measure of visual clutter presented in R. Rosenholtz, Y. Li, S. Mansfield, and Z. Jin (2005). This Feature Congestion measure of visual clutter is based on the analogy that the more cluttered a display or scene is, the more difficult it would be to add a new item that would reliably draw attention. A second measure of visual clutter, Subband Entropy, is based on the notion that clutter is related to the visual information in the display. Finally, we test a third measure, Edge Density, used by M. L. Mack and A. Oliva (2004) as a measure of subjective visual complexity. We explore the use of these measures as stand-ins for set size in visual search models and demonstrate that they correlate well with search performance in complex imagery. This includes the search-in-clutter displays of J. M. Wolfe, A. Oliva, T. <b>S.</b> Horowitz, <b>S.</b> <b>Butcher,</b> and A.

40|$|Background Whether {{intravenous}} {{tissue plasminogen}} activator (alteplase) is eff ective beyond 3 h after onset of acute ischaemic stroke is unclear. We aimed to test whether alteplase given 3 – 6 h after stroke onset promotes reperfusion and attenuates infarct growth in patients who have a mismatch in perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) and diff usionweighted MRI (DWI). Methods We prospectively and randomly assigned 101 patients to receive alteplase or placebo 3 – 6 h after onset of ischaemic stroke. PWI and DWI were done before and 3 – 5 days after therapy, with T 2 -weighted MRI at around day 90. The primary endpoint was infarct growth between baseline DWI and the day 90 T 2 lesion in mismatch patients. Major secondary endpoints were reperfusion, good neurological outcome, and good functional outcome. Patients, caregivers, and investigators were unaware of treatment allocations. Primary analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00238537. Findings We randomly assigned 52 patients to alteplase and 49 patients to placebo. Mean age was 71 · 6 years, and median score on the National Institutes of Health stroke scale was 13. 85 of 99 (86 %) patients had mismatch of PWI and DWI. The geometric mean infarct growth (exponential of the mean log of relative growth) was 1 · 24 with alteplase and 1 · 78 with placebo (ratio 0 · 69, 95 % CI 0 · 38 – 1 · 28; Student’s t test p= 0 · 239); the median relative infarct growth was 1 · 18 with alteplase and 1 · 79 with placebo (ratio 0 · 66, 0 · 36 – 0 · 92; Wilcoxon’s test p= 0 · 054). Reperfusion was more common with alteplase than with placebo and was associated with less infarct growth (p= 0 · 001), better neurological outcome (p< 0 · 0001), and better functional outcome (p= 0 · 010) than was no reperfusion. Interpretation Alteplase was non-signifi cantly associated with lower infarct growth and signifi cantly associated with increased reperfusion in patients who had mismatch. Because reperfusion was associated with improved clinical outcomes, phase III trials beyond 3 h after treatment are warranted.
