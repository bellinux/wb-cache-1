50|$|A massive new {{production}} facility {{was developed in}} the early 1970s on a green field site, adjacent to the Foden works. The new plant was designed for an annual capacity of 6,000 trucks, based on an expectation of a continued <b>boom</b> in <b>truck</b> sales and exports. Instead, the market collapsed. The expenditure and the economic downturn of the period saw Foden run into financial difficulty in December 1974. It was given support by Harold Wilson's Labour government. Foden struggled as its home market continued to be depressed. It was 1977-78 before Foden returned to reasonable profitability. Large MOD contracts to supply military vehicles helped with this recovery. The military required fibreglass cabs (strengthened for military use), meaning that civilian Foden trucks were constructed in the same way.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of hail and wind damage to crops {{has long been}} a difficult task. Yield effects of stand loss and defoliation at various crop stages are well known, but getting accurate damage information across a field has been problematic. A quick and accurate method of determining losses such as using remote sensing techniques could lead to more efficient crop management and more accurate insurance claims adjustment. New satellites with spatial and temporal resolution capable of assessing crop damage could provide data for producing maps of field damage. Field plots of maize, Zea mays L. were established in Indiana and Nebraska in 1997, 1998, and 1999 and were subjected to various levels of stand loss and leaf loss during vegetative and early reproductive growth stages. Remote sensing data were collected using a variety of imaging spectroradiometers mounted in airplanes and field spectrometers mounted on <b>boom</b> <b>trucks.</b> Radiometric data compiled by wavelength to produce spectral response curves showed light reflectance level directly related to damage level across a broad range of wavelengths. Using feature selection, a function of the image processing software MultiSpec, the red and near infrared (NIR) wavelength bands provided the most distinction among levels of damage. Classification of images by damage level was accomplished using a combination of red and near infrared bands and using Discriminate Analysis Feature Extraction (DAFE) to utilize the contribution of all sensor bands and attempt high accuracy. Classification accuracies achievable for discriminating four levels of damage inflicted on a particular date ranged from 72 % to 100 %, with accuracy depending on the band combination used and level of damage. In a field after a storm, remote sensing images could be used to extrapolate information collected by insurance adjusters, and produce damage maps of a field. Fewer ground checks would be needed to get an accurate damage estimate. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Cranes {{have come}} to symbolize {{building}} construction itself. They perform indispensable services in moving materials and components vertically and horizontally. Used since antiquity, their history is interrelated {{with the development of}} new power sources that replaced man and mule, first steam and later internal combustion, diesel, and electric engines. Mobile cranes can be rapidly deployed to lift heavy loads. New models with telescoping booms and all-terrain travel capability, compact urban machines, and even hybrids with tower cranes are beginning to replace the familiar lattice <b>boom</b> <b>truck</b> cranes. Mobile cranes have dominated the North American market, but a cultural change appears to be taking place toward tower cranes for building projects. Tower cranes, common in Europe for decades, are globally gaining in popularity with surging real estate developments. Ideal for dense urban environments and coming with a small footprint, they are available in a growing diversity of sizes and configurations. Sophisticated electronic controls and operator assistance devices are enhancing their safe and productive operation. While cranes occupy a central role on mid-rise and high-rise building projects, they operate in conjunction with other types of supporting equipment that are {{an essential part of the}} overall equipment array on todayâ€™s industrialized construction sites...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{scanning}} is a terrestrial laser-imaging {{system that}} creates highly accurate three-dimensional images of objects {{for use in}} standard computer-aided design software packages. This report describes results of a pilot study to investigate the use of laser scanning for transportation applications in Iowa. After an initial training period {{on the use of}} the scanner and Cyclone software, pilot tests were performed on the following projects: intersection and railroad bridge for training purposes; section of highway to determine elevation accuracy and pair of bridges to determine level of detail that can be captured; new concrete pavement to determine smoothness; bridge beams to determine camber for deck-loading calculations; stockpile to determine volume; and borrow pit to determine volume. Results show that it is possible to obtain 2 - 6 mm precision with the laser scanner as claimed by the manufacturer compared to approximately one-inch precision with aerial photogrammetry using a helicopter. A cost comparison between helicopter photogrammetry and laser scanning showed that laser scanning was approximately 30 percent higher in cost depending on assumptions. Laser scanning can become more competitive to helicopter photogrammetry by elevating the scanner on a <b>boom</b> <b>truck</b> and capturing both sides of a divided roadway at the same time. Two- and three-dimensional drawings were created in MicroStation for one of the scanned highway bridges. It was demonstrated that it is possible to create such drawings within the accuracy of this technology. It was discovered that a significant amount of time is necessary to convert point cloud images into drawings. As this technology matures, this task should become less time consuming. It appears that laser scanning technology does indeed have a place in the Iowa Department of Transportation design and construction toolbox. Based on results from this study, laser scanning can be used cost effectively for preliminary surveys to develop TIN meshes of roadway surfaces. It also appears that this technique can be used quite effectively to measure bridge beam camber in a safer and quicker fashion compared to conventional approaches. Volume calculations are also possible using laser scanning. It seems that measuring quantities of rock could be an area where this technology would be quite beneficial since accuracy is more important with this material compared to soil. Other applications for laser scanning could include developing as-built drawings of historical structures such as the bridges of Madison County. This technology could also be useful where safety is a concern such as accurately measuring the surface of a highway active with traffic or scanning the underside of a bridge damaged by a truck. It is recommended that the Iowa Department of Transportation initially rent the scanner when it is needed and purchase the software. With time, it may be cost justifiable to purchase the scanner as well. Laser scanning consultants can be hired as well but at a higher cost...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} about dilbit is the difficulty in cleaning it up.

After detection of the leak, <b>booms</b> and vacuum <b>trucks</b> were deployed. Heavy rains caused the river to overtop existing dams, and carried dilbit 30 miles downstream before the spill was contained. Remediation work collected over 1.1 million gallons of oil and almost 200,000 cubic yards of oil-contaminated sediment and debris from the Kalamazoo River system. However, oil was still being found in affected waters in October 2012.|$|R

40|$|Ultra {{wideband}} {{linear array}} holography {{is a unique}} real-time imaging technique for in-situ inspection of buried waste at various DOE sites. The array can be mounted on various platforms such as crane <b>booms,</b> pickup <b>trucks,</b> ATVs, and scanned generating `` 3 -D`` subsurface images in real time. Inspection speeds are 0. 5 to 2 meters/sec, if the image is viewed in real time, greater for off-line processing. The Ground Penetrating Holographic (GPH) system developed for inspection of DOE sites employs two 32 element arrays of tapered-slot antenna operating at 5 -GHz and 2. 5 -GHz center frequencies. The GPH system, which is mounted on a small trailer with a computer image processor, display, and power supply, is capable of imaging a wide swath (1 to 2 meters) with its linear arrays. The lower frequency array will be used at INEL (for greater depth penetration) because of high soil attenuation. Recent holographic `` 3 -D`` images of buried waste container lids and dielectrics obtained in Hanford sand and INEL soils at various depths graphically illustrate the unique image resolution capabilities of the system. Experimental results using the 5 -GHz array will be presented showing the excellent holographic image quality of various subsurface targets in sand and INEL soil...|$|R
