Shivkumar Sharma contributed on santoor, and the bansuri (bamboo flute) was played by S.R. Kenkare. Hariprasad Chaurasia also contributed on bansuri, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> the soundtrack pieces had been completed, and the efficient {{progress of the}} sessions allowed Harrison to record some other compositions.|$|E
5|$|A {{state may}} place {{the burden on}} the {{defendant}} has to prove incompetence by the preponderance of the evidence, but the state cannot require the defendant to prove incompetence by a higher standard, such as clear and convincing evidence. The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary. The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant in order to make her competent for trial, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is likely to result in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.|$|E
5|$|Ai {{initially}} {{refuses to}} see a connection between his sexuality and his mode of consciousness, preventing him from truly understanding the Gethenians; thus {{he is unable to}} persuade them of the importance of his mission. Ai's failure to comprehend shifgrethor and to trust Estraven's motives leads him to misunderstand much of the advice that Estraven gives him. As Ai's relationship to Estraven changes, their communication also changes; they are both more willing to acknowledge mistakes, and make fewer assertions. Eventually, the two are able to converse directly with mindspeech, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> Ai is able to understand Estraven's motivations, and no longer requires direct communication.|$|E

5|$|Always {{in need of}} funds, Raynald urged Manuel to {{send the}} promised subsidy to him, but Manuel failed to pay the money. Raynald made an {{alliance}} with Thoros II of Cilicia. They attacked Cyprus, subjecting the Byzantine island to a three-week orgy of violence in early 1156. They only left Cyprus on the rumour of an imperial fleet approaching the island, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> they had forced all Cypriots to ransom themselves, {{with the exception of}} the wealthiest individuals (including Emperor Manuel's nephew, John Doukas Komnenos), whom they carried off to Antioch. Cyprus would never entirely recover from the devastation that Raynald's and Thoros's marauding raid caused.|$|E
5|$|Best {{passed the}} eleven plus exam at Blackmoor Park primary school in West Derby, and was {{studying}} at the Liverpool Collegiate Grammar School in Shaw Street {{when he decided}} he wanted to be in a music group. Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler's music store and Best formed his own band, the Black Jacks. Chas Newby and Bill Barlow joined the group, as did Ken Brown, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> he had left the Quarrymen. The Black Jacks later became the resident group at the Casbah, after the Quarrymen cancelled their residency because of an argument about money.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, Liam Lotter found a grey {{piece of}} debris {{on a beach}} in {{southern}} Mozambique, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> he read in March 2016 about Gibson's find (some 300 kilometres from his find) did his family alert authorities. It was flown to Australia for analysis. It carried a stencilled code 676EB, which identified it as part of a Boeing 777 flap track fairing, and the style in which the lettering was painted onto the fairing matched stencils used by Malaysia Airlines, making it almost certain that the part came from 9M-MRO.|$|E

5|$|On June 15, 1836, Jackson {{signed a}} bill that allowed Michigan to become a state, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> it ceded the Toledo Strip. In {{exchange}} for this concession, Michigan would be granted the western three-quarters {{of what is now}} known as the Upper Peninsula (the easternmost portion had already been included in the state boundaries). Because of the perceived worthlessness of the Upper Peninsula's remote wilderness, a September 1836 special convention in Ann Arbor, Michigan, rejected the offer.|$|E
5|$|Serevi coached Fiji to {{the final}} of the first Sevens Series leg of 2007 in Wellington, where they lost to Samoa 17–14 in the final. The team then rebounded when they {{defeated}} Samoa to win the San Diego leg. Fiji's next tournament was Hong Kong where Serevi made a world record 18th appearance. He scored the final try as Fiji defeated New Zealand in Hong Kong. They then faced Samoa in the final; Samoa led 27–0 at half time. Although Fiji then scored 22 points in the second half, Samoa won the final 27–22. Fiji won the following tournament at Adelaide, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> a converted try by Serevi forcing extra time in their quarter final with South Africa.|$|E
5|$|St-Calais was {{the only}} bishop who did not {{actively}} aid the king; the rebelling magnates included Roger de Montgomery Earl of Shrewsbury, Robert de Mowbray Earl of Northumbria, and Odo's brother Robert Count of Mortain. The rebellion had failed {{by the end of}} the summer, but St-Calais continued to hold out in Durham, at first claiming he had never actually rebelled. When the king's army arrived, St-Calais agreed to come out, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> receiving a safe conduct that would allow him to attend a trial while his men continued to hold the castle. St-Calais's actions suggest that he did rebel, whatever his claims to the contrary and affirmations of his innocence in northern chronicles.|$|E

5|$|The Bayside {{extension}} was tentatively {{approved in}} June 1913, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> {{the construction of}} the initial extension to Flushing. Under the revised subway expansion plan put forth in December 1913, the Flushing Line would be extended past Main Street, along and/or parallel to the right-of-way of the nearby Port Washington Branch of the LIRR towards Bell Boulevard in Bayside. A spur line would branch off north along 149th Street towards College Point.|$|E
5|$|The Diet of 1468 {{authorized}} Matthias to levy {{an extraordinary}} tax {{to finance the}} new war, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> 8 prelates and 13 secular lords pledged on the King's behalf {{that he would not}} demand such charges in the future. Matthias also exercised royal prerogatives to increase his revenues. For instance, he ordered a Palatine's eyre in a county, the cost of which were to be covered by the local inhabitants but soon authorized the county to redeem the cancellation of this irksome duty.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot of the}} novella {{describes}} the life journey of fourteen-year-old Eréndira, who is living with her grandmother when she accidentally sets fire to their home. The grandmother forces Eréndira to repay the debt by becoming a prostitute as they travel the road as vagrants. Men line up to enjoy Eréndira's services. She eventually escapes {{with the assistance of}} her affectionate and somewhat gullible lover, Ulises, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> he murders her grandmother. After the murder, Eréndira runs off into the night alone, leaving him in the tent with the dead body of her grandmother.|$|E

5|$|Washington's {{retirement}} to personal business at Mount Vernon was short-lived. He made an exploratory {{trip to the}} western frontier in 1784 and inspected his land holdings in Western Pennsylvania that had been earned decades earlier for his service in the French and Indian War. There he confronted squatters, including David Reed and the Covenanters; they vacated, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> losing a court decision heard in Washington, Pennsylvania in 1786. He also facilitated {{the creation of the}} Potomac Company, a public–private partnership that sought to link the Potomac River with the Ohio River, but technical and financial challenges rendered the company unprofitable.|$|E
5|$|Best was {{studying}} at the Collegiate Grammar School {{when he decided}} he wanted to be in a music group, so Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler's music store and Best formed his own band; The Black Jacks, who later played in The Casbah. Chas Newby joined the group, as did Ken Brown, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> he had left The Quarrymen. The reason for Brown's exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the flu, so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best's living room to rest. This caused a massive quarrel {{with the rest of the}} group when Mona came to pay them, as they wanted Brown's money to be shared amongst the three of them, as Brown had not played. Mona refused, so The Quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out.|$|E
5|$|Disney was keen {{to promote}} Mulan to the Chinese, hoping to {{replicate}} their {{success with the}} 1994 film The Lion King, {{which was one of}} the country's highest-grossing Western films at that time. Disney also hoped it might smooth over relations with the Chinese government which had soured after the release of Kundun, a Disney-funded biography of the Dalai Lama that the Chinese government considered politically provocative. China had threatened to curtail business negotiations with Disney over that film and, as the government only accepts ten Western films per year to be shown in their country, Mulans chances of being accepted were low. Finally, after a year's delay, the Chinese government did allow the film a limited Chinese release, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> the Chinese New Year, so as to ensure that local films dominated the more lucrative holiday market. Box office income was low, due to both the unfavorable release date and rampant piracy. Chinese people also complained about Mulan's depiction as too foreign-looking and the story as too different from the myths.|$|E

5|$|Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England, {{when the}} Catholic King James II of England was deposed and the Protestant William III ascended the throne, a {{rebellion}} of Maryland Puritan Protestants overthrew Calvert's rule. They quickly rescinded the Toleration Act and banned public practice of Catholicism, {{and it would}} never be reinstated under colonial rule. In fact, the colony established the Church of England as its official church in 1702 and explicitly barred Catholics from voting in 1718. The Calvert family regained control over the colony in 1715, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> Benedict Calvert converted to Protestantism. His political control remained tenses enough that he did not risk an attempt to reinstate protections for Catholics. It took until the era of the American Revolution for religious tolerance or freedom to again become the practice in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In 1650, {{during the}} Third English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell's Parliamentarian forces invaded Scotland, {{taking control of}} the south of the country after their victory at Dunbar in September. In February 1651, Cromwell found his lines of {{communication}} under attack from a small group of Royalists based at Tantallon. This group, led by Alexander Seton, comprised just 91 men. Despite this, Cromwell's retaliation was to send 2,000 to 3,000 troops under General Monck, together with much of the artillery he had in Scotland, and lay siege to Tantallon. Seton was ennobled by Charles II, as Viscount of Kingston, on 14 February, during the siege. After twelve days of bombardment with cannon a breach was made in the Douglas Tower. The defenders were compelled to surrender, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> quarter had been granted to them in recognition of their bravery. After the siege Tantallon was left in ruins: it was never repaired or inhabited afterwards. The siege of Tantallon was also interesting in that the Commonwealth land forces were supported by the Commonwealth Navy.|$|E

Her coach is still upset about her decision to marry, but Kom makes a comeback in the National Boxing Championship. Despite performing better than her opponent, she loses the match due to the apparent partiality of the judges. Kom throws a chair in anger towards them, resulting in a ban. She later writes an apology letter, and the official accepts it, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> insulting her.|$|E
