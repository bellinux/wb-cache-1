50|$|The primary {{difference}} between the two <b>basic</b> <b>schemes</b> is in polarization. As the feed horn in the rotated process spins, the polarization changes with the rotation and will thus be 90 degrees off in polarization when the feed is 90 degrees off its initial axis. As the feed horn is fixed in nutated feeds, no polarization changes occur. Most early systems used a rotated feed, due to its mechanical simplicity, but later systems often used nutated feeds in order to use the polarization information.|$|E

5000|$|Spatial {{sampling}} involves determining {{a limited}} number of locations in geographic space for faithfully measuring phenomena that are subject to dependency and heterogeneity. [...] Dependency suggests that since one location can predict the value of another location, we do not need observations in both places. But heterogeneity suggests that this relation can change across space, and therefore we cannot trust an observed degree of dependency beyond a region that may be small. Basic spatial sampling schemes include random, clustered and systematic. These <b>basic</b> <b>schemes</b> can be applied at multiple levels in a designated spatial hierarchy (e.g., urban area, city, neighborhood). It is also possible to exploit ancillary data, for example, using property values as a guide in a spatial sampling scheme to measure educational attainment and income. Spatial models such as autocorrelation statistics, regression and interpolation (see below) can also dictate sample design.|$|E

5000|$|All the schemes {{of basic}} and {{supplementary}} pensions in France {{work on the}} method of distribution. The schemes redistribute every year, {{in the form of}} pensions paid to retirees, contributions received that year from the assets. If the rules of the various pension plans in France correspond to different concepts, however they are based on common principles. All schemes incorporate mechanisms of solidarity: solidarity between generations (principle of distribution) and solidarity within a single generation (large redistributions between different occupational groups and gender). These principles of solidarity occurs both in the regimes, between the regimes and beyond regimes at the national level. There are transfers between the schemes, and therefore solidarity between the <b>basic</b> <b>schemes,</b> as well as mechanisms for schemes coordination. Solidarity at the national level consists of the minimum old-age pension assigned to all seniors who have limited resources, paid by the solidarity fund retirement (which also pay some family benefits), but also of state subsidies granted to certain regimes (farmers, SNCF, RATP, mining, marine ...), and finally of various taxes allocated to pensions. The retirement system in France is organized into three levels: a compulsory system, a scheme often mandatory, and optional arrangements.|$|E

The two-step parallelization scheme they develop is based upon LLNL`s two-step scheme.

The former transmits a single transport stream of interleaved voice and video, while the latter treats the two media as separate transport streams. Each approach has an option not to exert the synchronization control at the destination, which leads to four <b>basic</b> <b>schemes.</b> On an interconnected ATM-wireless LAN, we implemented the four <b>basic</b> <b>schemes</b> with RTP/RTCP on top of UDP and two variants which exercise dynamic resolution control of JPEG video. Making the performance measurement of the six schemes, we compare them to identify and evaluate {{advantages and disadvantages of}} each approach. We then show that the performance difference between the two approaches is small and that the dynamic resolution control improves the synchronization quality...|$|E

Sensor devices have to share a secret key for secure communication. There are several key distribution schemes for wireless sensor networks in the literature. The most common key distribution <b>scheme</b> is the <b>basic</b> <b>scheme</b> which is proposed by Eschenauer and Gligor. <b>Basic</b> <b>scheme</b> has three phases; Key Predistribution, Shared Key Discovery and Path-key Establishment. Ergun proposed an alternative phase to Path-key Establishment, called Key Transfer phase.

We use TelosB devices, which have 10 kB RAM, 1 MB ash memory, a microcontroller and RF interface. We design owcharts for each phase, create packet structures, implement in NesC programming language and test the implementation. We analyze the results using processing time, code space and memory usage metrics. We show that Key Transfer phase is more e cient than Path-key Establishment phase...|$|R

40|$|Two {{efficient}} authenticated encryption schemes with message linkages are proposed. One is a <b>basic</b> <b>scheme,</b> {{that it has}} {{the better}} performance {{in comparison with the}} all previously proposed schemes in terms of the communication and the computation costs. However, it has a property as same as the previously proposed schemes, that the message blocks can be recovered only after the entire signature blocks have been received. Therefore, the <b>basic</b> <b>scheme</b> is applicable to encrypt all-or-nothing flow. Thus, we improve the <b>basic</b> <b>scheme</b> and also propose a generalized scheme, which allows the receiver to recover the partial message blocks before receiving the entire signature blocks, That is, the receiver may perform the receiving and the recovering processes simultaneously. Therefore, the generalized scheme is applicable to message flows. The generalized scheme requires smaller bandwidth and computational time as compared to the previously proposed authenticated encryption schemes with message linkages for message flows.
