For galloping, the rider should lean slightly forward as the horse takes off, as the horse will be less likely to slip from under the rider. When pulling the horse up, the rider should lean back, which will lessen the shock of the sudden change in speed. Xenophon also suggests the rider loosen the reins and grab the mane when jumping a ditch or climbing an incline, so that he does not pull the horse in the mouth. Going down a steep incline, the rider should throw himself straight <b>backward</b> and <b>hold</b> the horse with the bit.|$|R

The first Greaser huddled low, let his carbine go clattering down, and then crawled behind the rim. The second and third jerked back. The fourth seemed to flop up over the crest of lava. A dark arm reached for him, clutched his leg, tried to drag him up. It was in vain.

50|$|The {{author of}} this work has been {{previously}} highly debated, with many previous critics assigning the work to Elisabetta Sirani, and categorizing as a statement by a 17th-century feminist. She is depicted in the white robes of a Roman Sybil or perhaps a vestal virgin, evoking sympathy. She looks back melancholic at an angle <b>backward.</b> Tradition <b>holds</b> that he painted the work for the Cardinal Ascanio Colonna. The work has inspired many romantic artists including Stendhal, Percy Shelley, Dumas, Artaud, and Guerrazzi. The debate over the authorship and the its influence are as interesting as the work itself. Traditions with no factual documentation claim Reni entered her cell the day prior to the execution, or saw her {{on the way to}} the scaffold. Others claim he was not even in Rome at that date. The earliest Barberini catalogue states it likely depicts the Cenci girl by an unknown painter, only a later one attributes the work to Reni.|$|R

50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with a schoolboy pin. The attacking wrestler holds their opponent from behind in a waistlock. The attacking wrestler then performs a <b>backward</b> roll while <b>holding</b> the waistlock. The opponent ends up on their shoulders with the attacking wrestler sitting on top of their legs holding the opponent down. This move is often done when the opponent is leaning on the ropes facing out of the ring and the attacking wrestler would first push forward into the ropes with the waistlock in order to generate faster backward motion. A common heel tactic is to grab the back of the opponents clothing or tights while sitting on top of them or to use the ropes for leverage, thus making the pin illegal.|$|R
40|$|Kleisli {{simulation}} is a categorical notion {{introduced by}} Hasuo to verify finite trace inclusion. They {{allow us to}} give definitions of forward and backward simulation for various types of systems. A generic categorical theory behind Kleisli simulation has been developed and it guarantees the soundness of those simulations wrt. finite trace semantics. Moreover, those simulations can be aided by forward partial execution (FPE) - a categorical transformation of systems previously introduced by the authors. In this paper, we give Kleisli simulation a theoretical foundation that assures its soundness also wrt. infinite trace. There, following Jacobs 2 ̆ 7 work, infinite trace semantics is characterized as the "largest homomorphism. " It turns out that soundness of forward simulations is rather straightforward; that of <b>backward</b> simulation <b>holds</b> too, although it requires certain additional conditions and its proof is more involved. We also show that FPE can be successfully employed in the infinite trace setting to enhance the applicability of Kleisli simulations as witnesses of trace inclusion. Our framework is parameterized in the monad for branching {{as well as in}} the functor for linear-time behaviors; for the former we use the powerset monad (for nondeterminism) as well as the sub-Giry monad (for probability) ...|$|R
50|$|Although it was uncommon, {{the drive}} bands could {{fall out of}} adjustment, {{allowing}} the car to creep, particularly when cold, adding another hazard to attempting to start the car: a person cranking the engine could be forced <b>backward</b> while still <b>holding</b> the crank as the car crept forward, although it was nominally in neutral. As the car utilized a wet clutch, this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the differential through a single universal joint attached to a torque tube which drove the rear axle; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing.

40|$|We {{consider}} differential inclusions where {{a positive}} semidefinite {{function of the}} solutions satisfies a class-KL estimate {{in terms of time}} and a second positive semidefinite function of the initial condition. We show that a smooth converse Lyapunov function, i. e., one whose derivative along solutions can be used to establish the class-KL estimate, exists if and only if the class-KL estimate is robust, i. e., it holds for a larger, perturbed differential inclusion. It remains an open question whether all class-KL estimates are robust. One sufficient condition for robustness is that the original differential inclusion is locally Lipschitz. Another sufficient condition is that the two positive semidefinite functions agree and a <b>backward</b> completability condition <b>holds.</b> These special cases unify and generalize many results on converse Lyapunov theorems for differential equations and differential inclusions that have appeared in the literature.

My claim in the present paper is that the historical attitude toward death reflects a cultural phenomenon where death is a constant presence.

Recent studies show that visual search is less {{efficient}} when loads are placed on working memory (WM) by having subjects manipulate information (i. e. count backwards from a target digit) but not when subjects simply maintain information in WM (i. e. rehearse a set of random digits). We tested the effects of different WM loads (maintain versus manipulate) on driver detection of peripheral letter targets and on driving performance using a driving simulator. Participants (n= 40) performed secondary tasks that loaded either visuo-spatial working memory or verbal working memory (phonological loop). The verbal task required participants to either rehearse a string of random letters or to alphabetize the string while driving. In the visual task the participants were presented with {{an image of a}} human stick figure in different orientations (up-right, up-side down, facing forward or facing <b>backward)</b> and <b>holding</b> different geometric shapes in each hand. The participants were asked to either remember the figure or to identify what the figure was holding in one of the hands. The simulation consisted four equal length segments demarcated by stop lights. At the start of each road segment the participants were presented with a random letter string or a stick figure and asked to memorize the stimulus or to manipulate it (i. e, alphabetize or identify which hand held a particular shape) while driving. The results show that subjects detected fewer peripheral letter targets (p =. 016) and responded more slowly to peripheral targets (p=. 002) when manipulating information using WM regardless of modality (visual or verbal). Subjects also received more speeding tickets but drove slightly slower while engaged in the manipulation tasks. These data show that WM tasks that require participants to manipulate information regardless of modality (visual or verbal) negatively affect driving performance and interfere with a drivers' visual search of the driving environment...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new fast O(n²) {{algorithm}} for solving Cauchy linear systems of equations. An a priori rounding error analysis, which provides bounds for the forward, backward and residual errors associated with the computed solution, indicates that for the class of totally positive Cauchy matrices the proposed algorithm is forward and backward stable, producing a remarkably high relative accuracy. In particular Hilbert linear systems, often considered to be too ill-conditioned to be attacked, actually can be rapidly solved with a favorably high precision. The results indicate to a close resemblance between the numerical properties of Cauchy matrices and the much-studied Vandermonde matrices. In particular, our proposed Cauchy solver is an analog of the the well-known Björck-Pereyra algorithm for Vandermonde systems, whose often favorable numerical properties motivated a number of authors, who extended this algorithm to the more general Vandermonde-related structures, and obtained favorable forward error bounds. Here we obtain also nice backward and residual error bounds for the Björck-Pereyra algorithm, and show that all these forward and <b>backward</b> stability results <b>hold</b> not just for Vandermonde and Vandermonde-related structures, but that they have counterparts for other classes of structured matrices, in particular for Cauchy matrices. The proposed algorithm is used to illustrate via computed examples the connection of high relative accuracy to the concepts of effective well-conditioning and of total positivity...|$|R
