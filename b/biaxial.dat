5|$|The objects {{created by}} amphiphiles are usually spherical (as {{in the case}} of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or <b>biaxial</b> (all three micelle axes are distinct). These {{anisotropic}} self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves {{in much the same way}} as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).|$|E
25|$|QuinXell Technologies from Singapore has {{developed}} a bioreactor known as the TisXell <b>Biaxial</b> Bioreactor which is specially designed {{for the purpose of}} tissue engineering. It is the first bioreactor in the world to have a spherical glass chamber with <b>biaxial</b> rotation; specifically to mimic the rotation of the fetus in the womb; which provides a conducive environment for the growth of tissues.|$|E
25|$|The two {{refractive}} indices can {{be determined}} using the index ellipsoids for given directions of the polarization. Note that for <b>biaxial</b> crystals the index ellipsoid {{will not be an}} ellipsoid of revolution ("spheroid") but is described by three unequal principle refractive indices nα, nβ and nγ. Thus there is no axis around which a rotation leaves the optical properties invariant (as there is with uniaxial crystals whose index ellipsoid is a spheroid).|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} no axis of symmetry, there are two optical axes or binormals which are defined as {{directions}} along which light may propagate without birefringence, i.e., directions along which the wavelength is independent of polarization. For this reason, birefringent materials with three distinct refractive indices are called <b>biaxial.</b> Additionally, there are two distinct axes known as optical ray axes or biradials along which the group velocity of the light is independent of polarization.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} composition of ammolite is variable, and aside from aragonite may include calcite, silica, pyrite, or other minerals. The shell itself may contain {{a number of}} trace elements, including: aluminium; barium; chromium; copper; iron; magnesium; manganese; strontium; titanium; and vanadium. Its crystallography is orthorhombic. Its hardness is 4.5–5.5, and its specific gravity is 2.60–2.85. The refractive index of Canadian material (as measured via sodium light, 589.3nm) is as follows: α 1.522; β 1.672–1.673; γ 1.676–1.679; <b>biaxial</b> negative. Under ultraviolet light, ammolite may fluoresce a mustard yellow.|$|E
25|$|Uniaxial {{birefringence}} {{is classified}} as positive when the extraordinary index of refraction ne {{is greater than the}} ordinary index no. Negative birefringence means that Δn = ne − no is less than zero. In other words, the polarization of the fast (or slow) wave is perpendicular to the optic axis when the birefringence of the crystal is positive (or negative, respectively). In the case of <b>biaxial</b> crystals, all three of the principal axes have different refractive indices, so this designation does not apply. But for any defined ray direction one can just as well designate the fast and slow ray polarizations.|$|E
25|$|The {{refractive}} index (as measured by sodium light, 589.3nm) of turquoise is approximately 1.61 or 1.62; {{this is a}} mean value seen as a single reading on a gemmological refractometer, owing to the almost invariably polycrystalline nature of turquoise. A reading of 1.61–1.65 (birefringence 0.040, <b>biaxial</b> positive) has been taken from rare single crystals. An absorption spectrum may also be obtained with a hand-held spectroscope, revealing a line at 432nm and a weak band at 460nm (this is best seen with strong reflected light). Under longwave ultraviolet light, turquoise may occasionally fluoresce green, yellow or bright blue; it is inert under shortwave ultraviolet and X-rays.|$|E
25|$|Fine ground calcium {{carbonate}} (GCC) {{is an essential}} ingredient in the microporous film used in diapers and some building films as the pores are nucleated around the {{calcium carbonate}} particles during the manufacture of the film by <b>biaxial</b> stretching. GCC or PCC {{is used as a}} filler in paper because they are cheaper than wood fiber. In terms of market volume, GCC are the most important types of fillers currently used. Printing and writing paper can contain 10–20% calcium carbonate. In North America, calcium carbonate has begun to replace kaolin in the production of glossy paper. Europe has been practicing this as alkaline papermaking or acid-free papermaking for some decades. PCC used for paper filling and paper coatings is precipitated and prepared in a variety of shapes and sizes having characteristic narrow particle size distributions and equivalent spherical diameters of 0.4 to 3 micrometres.|$|E
500|$|When {{viewed with}} {{polarized}} light under a petrographic microscope, widgiemoolthalite appears bluish-green {{and does not}} exhibit pleochroism. It is <b>biaxial</b> positive and has a high optic angle (or 2V). [...] When measured perpendicular and parallel to its axis of anisotropy, its refractive indices are 1.630 and 1.640 respectively. This gives it a birefringence of 0.010.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} common LC phases is the nematic. The word nematic comes from the Greek [...] (...) , which means [...] "thread". This term {{originates}} from the thread-like topological defects observed in nematics, which are formally called 'disclinations'. Nematics also exhibit so-called [...] "hedgehog" [...] topological defects. In a nematic phase, the calamitic or rod-shaped organic molecules have no positional order, but they self-align to have long-range directional order with their long axes roughly parallel. Thus, the molecules are free to flow and their center of mass positions are randomly distributed as in a liquid, but still maintain their long-range directional order. Most nematics are uniaxial: they have one axis that is longer and preferred, with the other two being equivalent (can be approximated as cylinders or rods). However, some liquid crystals are <b>biaxial</b> nematics, meaning that in addition to orienting their long axis, they also orient along a secondary axis. Nematics have fluidity similar to that of ordinary (isotropic) liquids but they can be easily aligned by an external magnetic or electric field. Aligned nematics have the optical properties of uniaxial crystals and this makes them extremely useful in liquid-crystal displays (LCD).|$|E
2500|$|The case of {{so-called}} <b>biaxial</b> crystals is substantially more complex. These {{are characterized by}} three refractive indices corresponding to ...|$|E
2500|$|The best {{characterized}} birefringent {{materials are}} crystals. Due to their specific crystal structures their refractive indices are well defined. Depending on the symmetry of a crystal structure (as determined {{by one of}} the 32 possible crystallographic point groups), crystals in that group may be forced to be isotropic (not birefringent), to have uniaxial symmetry, or neither in which case it is a <b>biaxial</b> crystal. The crystal structures permitting uniaxial and <b>biaxial</b> birefringence are noted in the two tables, below, listing the two or three principal refractive indices (at wavelength [...] 590nm) of some better known crystals.|$|E
2500|$|In 1919, [...] Stanisław Rodowicz, an engineer, {{developed}} {{the first draft}} of the container system in Poland. In 1920, he built a prototype of the <b>biaxial</b> wagon. The Polish-Bolshevik War stopped development of the container system in Poland.|$|E
2500|$|We {{consider}} the propagation for the SVEA {{of the electric}} field in a homogeneous dispersive nonisotropic medium. Assuming the pulse is propagating {{in the direction of}} the z-axis, it can be shown that the envelope [...] for one of the most general of cases, namely a <b>biaxial</b> crystal, is governed by the PDE: ...|$|E
2500|$|Polyethylene naphthalate film {{capacitors}} are film capacitors using a dielectric {{made of the}} thermoplastic <b>biaxial</b> polymer material polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), {{trade names}} Kaladex®, Teonex®. [...] They are produced only as metallized types. PEN, like PET, belongs to the polyester family, but has better stability at high temperatures. Therefore, PEN film capacitors {{are more suitable for}} high temperature applications and for SMD packaging.|$|E
2500|$|However {{materials}} {{in which all}} three refractive indices are different are termed <b>biaxial</b> and {{the origin of this}} term is more complicated and frequently misunderstood. In a uniaxial crystal, different polarization components of a beam will travel at different phase velocities, except for rays in the direction of what we call the optic axis. Thus the optic axis has the particular property that rays in that direction do not exhibit birefringence, with all polarizations in such a beam experiencing the same index of refraction. It is very different when the three principal refractive indices are all different; then an incoming ray in any of those principle directions will still encounter two different refractive indices. But it turns out that there are two special directions (at an angle to all of the 3 axes) where the refractive indices for different polarizations are again equal. For this reason, these crystals were designated as <b>biaxial,</b> with the two [...] "axes" [...] in this case referring to ray directions in which propagation does not experience birefringence.|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the work}} {{involving}} polarization preceded the understanding of light as a transverse electromagnetic wave, and this has affected some terminology in use. Isotropic materials have symmetry in all directions and the refractive index {{is the same for}} any polarization direction. An anisotropic material is called [...] "birefringent" [...] because it will generally refract a single incoming ray in two directions, which we now understand correspond to the two different polarizations. This is true of either a uniaxial or <b>biaxial</b> material.|$|E
2500|$|For a <b>biaxial</b> {{material}} a similar but more complicated condition {{on the two}} waves can be described; the allowed k vectors in a specified direction now lie on one of two ellipsoids. By inspection one can see that eqn. 6 is generally satisfied for two positive values of ω. Or for a specified optical frequency ω and direction normal to the wavefronts k/|k|, it is satisfied for two [...] wavenumbers (propagation constants) |k| (and thus effective refractive indices) corresponding to the propagation of two linear polarizations in that direction.|$|E
2500|$|Often, {{mechanical}} bodies {{experience more}} than one type of stress at the same time; this is called combined stress. [...] In normal and shear stress, {{the magnitude of the}} stress is maximum for surfaces that are perpendicular to a certain direction , and zero across any surfaces that are parallel to [...] [...] When the shear stress is zero only across surfaces that are perpendicular to one particular direction, the stress is called <b>biaxial,</b> and can be viewed as the sum of two normal or shear stresses. In the most general case, called triaxial stress, the stress is nonzero across every surface element.|$|E
2500|$|When {{polypropylene}} film is extruded and stretched {{in both the}} machine direction and across machine direction it is called biaxially oriented polypropylene. <b>Biaxial</b> orientation increases strength and clarity. BOPP is widely used as a packaging material for packaging products such as snack foods, fresh produce and confectionery. It is easy to coat, print and laminate to give the required appearance and properties {{for use as a}} packaging material. [...] This process is normally called converting. It is normally produced in large rolls which are slit on slitting machines into smaller rolls for use on packaging machines.|$|E
2500|$|Laminate: The snowboard's core is also {{sandwiched}} {{on the top}} {{and bottom}} by at least two layers of fiberglass. [...] The fiberglass adds stiffness and torsional strength to the board. [...] The fiberglass laminate may be either <b>biaxial</b> (fibers running the length of the board and more fibers 90 degrees perpendicular to it), triax (fibers running the length of the board with 45 degree fibers running across it), or quadax (a hybrid of the biax and triax). [...] Some snowboards also add carbon and aramid (also known as Twaron or Kevlar) stringers for additional elasticity and strength.|$|E
2500|$|Standard {{ellipsometry}} (or {{just short}} 'ellipsometry') is applied, when no s polarized light is converted into p polarized light nor vice versa. This {{is the case}} for optically isotropic samples, for instance, amorphous materials or crystalline materials with a cubic crystal structure. Standard ellipsometry is also sufficient for optically uniaxial samples in the special case, when the optical axis is aligned parallel to the surface normal. In all other cases, when s polarized light is converted into p polarized light and/or vice versa, the generalized ellipsometry approach must be applied. [...] Examples are arbitrarily aligned, optically uniaxial samples, or optically <b>biaxial</b> samples.|$|E
2500|$|Strength of {{materials}} {{is defined as}} the maximum stress that can be endured before fracture occurs. Strength of biomaterials (bioceramics) is an important mechanical property because they are brittle. In brittle materials like bioceramics, cracks easily propagate when the material is subject to tensile loading, [...] unlike compressive loading. A number of methods are available for determining the tensile strength {{of materials}}, such as the bending flexural test, the <b>biaxial</b> flexural strength test and the weibull approach. In bioceramics, flaws influence the reliability and strength of the material during implantation and fabrication. There are a number of ways that flaws can be produced in bioceramics such as thermal sintering and heating. The importance is for bioceramics to have high reliability, [...] rather than high strength.|$|E
2500|$|The {{refractive}} {{indices of}} ianbruceite {{are similar to}} that of ordinary window glass, with nα = 1.601, nβ = 1.660 and nγ = 1.662. [...] The refractive index varies with the wavelength (color) of light, so the positions of the optic axes in <b>biaxial</b> crystals, and the angle 2V between them, will change when the color of the incident light is changed. This effect may be expressed in the form r > v, indicating that the angle 2V is greater for red than for violet light, or vice versa. [...] For ianbruceite 2V is greater for violet light than for red light, v > r. [...] The angle 2V has been measured as 18°; it can also be calculated from the values of the refractive indices α, β and γ, giving a value of 20°. [...] The mineral does not fluoresce in ultraviolet light.|$|E
2500|$|When {{those two}} {{propagation}} constants are equal then the effective refractive index {{is independent of}} polarization, and there is consequently no birefringence encountered by a wave traveling in that particular direction. For a uniaxial crystal, this is the optic axis, the z direction {{according to the above}} construction. But when all three refractive indices (or permittivities), nx, ny and nz are distinct, it can be shown that there are exactly two such directions (where the two ellipsoids intersect); these directions are not at all obvious and do not lie along any of the three principal axes (x, y, and z according to the above convention). Historically that accounts {{for the use of the}} term [...] "biaxial" [...] for such crystals, as the existence of exactly two such special directions (considered [...] "axes") was discovered well before polarization and birefringence were understood physically. However these two special directions are generally not of particular interest; <b>biaxial</b> crystals are rather specified by their three refractive indices corresponding to the three axes of symmetry.|$|E
2500|$|In 1827, Hamilton {{presented}} {{a theory of}} a single function, now known as Hamilton's principal function, that brings together mechanics, optics, and mathematics, and which helped to establish the wave theory of light. He proposed it when he first predicted its existence in the third supplement to his [...] "Systems of Rays," [...] read in 1832. The Royal Irish Academy paper was finally entitled [...] "Theory of Systems of Rays," [...] (23 April 1827) and the first part was printed in 1828 in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy. The more important contents of {{the second and third}} parts appeared in the three voluminous supplements (to the first part) which were published in the same Transactions, and in the two papers [...] "On a General Method in Dynamics," [...] which appeared in the Philosophical Transactions in 1834 and 1835. In these papers, Hamilton developed his great principle of [...] "Varying Action". The most remarkable result of this work is the prediction that a single ray of light entering a <b>biaxial</b> crystal at a certain angle would emerge as a hollow cone of rays. This discovery is still known by its original name, [...] "conical refraction".|$|E

The optic angle, 2V, is the angle between the two optic axes that is split by {{the direction of the}} lowest index of refraction. If 2V is acute, the mineral is <b>biaxial</b> positive. In sarabauite crystals this angle is obtuse, thus the mineral is <b>biaxial</b> negative.|$|E

50|$|The main {{difference}} between a solid slab and a voided <b>biaxial</b> slab refers to shear resistance. Due to the reduced concrete volume, the shear resistance will also be reduced.
