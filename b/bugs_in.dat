5|$|A common {{complaint}} regarding Halo 2s online {{play was}} widespread cheating, which began occurring {{almost immediately after}} the game's release. Users exploited <b>bugs</b> <b>in</b> the game and vulnerabilities of the network to win ranked games and thus increase their matchmaking rank.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, an {{unofficial}} patch was released to keep C working on both 32 and 64 bit versions of Windows XP and higher. The patch fixes several <b>bugs</b> <b>in</b> the game, and adds upgrades like higher resolution {{and support for}} language packs.|$|E

50|$|Proponents of {{waterfall}} model argue that {{time spent in}} designing is a worthwhile investment, {{with the hope that}} less time and effort will be spent fixing a <b>bug</b> <b>in</b> the early stages of a software product's lifecycle than when that same bug is found and must be fixed later. That is, {{it is much easier to}} fix a requirements <b>bug</b> <b>in</b> the requirements phase than to fix that same <b>bug</b> <b>in</b> the implementation phase, as to fix a requirements <b>bug</b> <b>in</b> the implementation phase requires scrapping at least some of the implementation and design work which has already been completed.|$|R

5|$|In {{an effort}} to reset its {{relationship}} with developers, Twitter acquired Crashlytics on January 28, 2013 for over USD $100 million, its largest acquisition to date. Founded by Jeff Seibert and Wayne Chang, Crashlytics had rapidly gained popularity {{as a tool to}} help mobile developers identify and fix <b>bugs</b> <b>in</b> their apps. Twitter committed to continue supporting and expanding the service.|$|E
5|$|Europa Barbarorum {{was first}} {{released}} to the public as an open beta in December 2005. After several more minor releases throughout 2006 which mostly fixed bugs and made small adjustments to the modification, the next major release of Europa Barbarorum was version 0.80 in December 2006. Its changes included the addition of the Sabaean faction, new music, and the inclusion of a new military–industrial complex system. There were three more 0.8-series releases {{during the first half of}} 2007 which primarily made minor adjustments to the modification and fixed <b>bugs.</b> <b>In</b> total, over 135,000 downloads of the 0.80–0.81 versions were tracked.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 2010, a Brendan Casey (also {{known as}} scient) {{released}} an unofficial patch, which fixes <b>bugs</b> <b>in</b> Alpha Centauri. His project began in February 2009 at Apolyton's Alpha Centauri site, {{and moved in}} June 2009 to the Civilization Gaming Network, where he planned to continue developing further patch versions. He seemed to have resumed work in March 2013 at the http://alphacentauri2.info fan site. Currently, the subsequent patches of other modders generally build upon scient's original 1.0 patch. There is a graphics update, Artificial Intelligence update, and an additional modifications patch amongst others there.|$|E

5|$|Screening of donated blood, blood components, {{and solid}} organ donors, {{as well as}} donors of cells, tissues, and cell and tissue {{products}} for T. cruzi is mandated in all Chagas-endemic countries and has been implemented. Approximately 300,000 infected people live in the United States, which is likely the result of immigration from Latin American countries, {{and there have been}} 23 cases acquired from kissing <b>bugs</b> <b>in</b> the United States reported between 1955 and 2014. With increased population movements, the possibility of transmission by blood transfusion became more substantial in the United States. Transfusion blood and tissue products are now actively screened in the U.S., thus addressing and minimizing this risk.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} less {{successful}} in resolving other issues; programmer Matt Pritchard complained following {{the release of}} Age of Empires that {{there was still no}} process by which patches could be issued. Extensive cheating in multiplayer games of Age of Empires came as a result of several <b>bugs</b> <b>in</b> the game, which resulted in Microsoft promising Ensemble Studios there would be a patch process for The Age of Kings. On release, there were several bugs that needed immediate attention, but the patch process was not yet ready. The first patch was released 11 months later.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{discovers that}} he has an ally who is also working {{undercover}} at the half-built resort, Felix Leiter, who has been recalled to duty by the CIA and is working ostensibly as an electrical engineer while setting up <b>bugs</b> <b>in</b> Scaramanga's meeting room. However, they learn that Scaramanga plans to eliminate Bond when the weekend is over. Bond's true identity is confirmed by a KGB agent and Scaramanga makes new plans to entertain the gangsters and the KGB agent by killing Bond while they are riding a sight-seeing train to a marina. However, Bond manages to turn the tables on Scaramanga and, {{with the help of}} Leiter, kill most of the conspirators. Wounded, Scaramanga escapes into the swamps, where Bond pursues him. Scaramanga lulls Bond off-guard and shoots him with a golden derringer hidden in his palm. Bond is hit but returns fire and shoots Scaramanga several times, killing him at last.|$|E

5|$|More than 2.7million players {{participated in}} the beta, which lasted from May 3 to 20. The game was rolled out from an {{internal}} group of Bungie and Microsoft employees, with {{the total number of}} players in the thousands. When the beta went public, more than a million played the first day, causing back-end servers to struggle to handle the traffic. While the engineering team had overestimated server load, <b>bugs</b> <b>in</b> server clusters caused game uploads to become backed up, slowing matchmaking until the underlying issues could be fixed. Jarrard noted that the 16million total hours of play time and large-scale rollout of the beta was vital to seeing how Reach would perform.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{releases}} of System 6 were unstable; many third party software developers {{did not receive}} copies before its release, resulting in widespread compatibility problems. At first, many common software programs such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Works and 4th Dimension were not fully compatible with System 6. There were also software <b>bugs</b> <b>in</b> the Color Manager, Script Manager, and Sound Manager extension files. Apple announced that 66 bugs were fixed when the 6.0.1 update was released in September 1988. However, a major bug involving text spacing of screen fonts was found in 6.0.1 after distribution began. This led to the quick release of 6.0.2, which solved this problem. Some customers waited longer until moving to System 6 because of the poor reputation already gained.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to earlier}} {{recurring}} issues with mistranslations related to news updates, the team {{decided not to}} implement forums in the original release, instead hearing player feedback through fan sites and unofficial forums. Also because of mistranslation fears, dedicated teams {{in each of the}} game's release regions would gather feedback and transmit it to the development team. The game's first closed Alpha test began on March 11, 2010. It was available only to veteran players from XI. During alpha testing, the team used player feedback to find out key problems with the game, such as limitations on graphical adjustments making the game run at a slow frame rate. The open Beta test was originally scheduled to begin on August 31, but was indefinitely postponed due to the discovery of critical <b>bugs</b> <b>in</b> the game. The Beta test eventually went live on September 2, running until the game's release later that month. It was later stated that more time should have been given to fixing bugs during the Beta period. The game released on September 30, 2010, six months prior to the PS3 version's projected release date of March 2011. A Collector's Edition was released on September 22, allowing owners to log into the game from that date. The Collector's Edition, which was decorated by artwork from Amano and Yoshida, came with bonus items including a DVD featuring a behind-the-scenes documentary, a security token, a case for the game's box, and a decorated tumbler. The game was released with text in Japanese, English, French and German, while the spoken dialogue in cutscenes was English in all versions.|$|E

5000|$|The {{standard}} interpreter and {{the official}} specification do not match perfectly. One {{difference is that the}} compiler stops execution with data outside the 33-126 range.

25|$|Aggregation {{behavior}} is also common in adults in some species. Aside from combined chemical defenses, other possible benefits of aggregation include better mating opportunities and shelter, greater retention of moisture and heat, {{and a possible}} sense of security. Lone <b>bugs</b> <b>in</b> some species {{were known to be}} more likely to be skittish than <b>bugs</b> <b>in</b> groups. However, aggregation can also increase the threats of diseases, parasites, and parasitoids.|$|E

25|$|Chemical {{secretions}} from dorsal abdominal or sternal exocrine glands {{are used}} to attract mates by certain species of jewel <b>bugs.</b> <b>In</b> certain genera (like Tectocoris, Psacasta, Odontoscelis, and Irochrotus), males possess special unicellular glands in the abdomen known as the androconia (singular: androconium). They release sex pheromones when ruptured.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{approaches}} to defeating CAPTCHAs: using cheap human labor to recognize them, exploiting <b>bugs</b> <b>in</b> the implementation that allow the attacker to completely bypass the CAPTCHA, and finally using machine learning to build an automated solver. According to former Google click fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder, there are numerous criminal services which solve CAPTCHAs automatically.|$|E
