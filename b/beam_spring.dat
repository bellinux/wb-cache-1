This paper addresses the problem of predicting the behavior of full scale precast concrete sandwich panel walls, using data collected from small, inexpensive push-off specimens. Several fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) connectors being used today underwent shear testing performed on component scale push-off specimens. Each specimen contained several of the FRP connectors and the variables studied were wythe thickness, insulation type and insulation bond. A simplified <b>beam</b> <b>spring</b> model was created which uses beams to represent the concrete wythes and shear springs to model the shear deformation behavior created by the foam and shear connectors. This model {{was found to be}} accurate as compared to results from the literature. A short parametric study was performed using the <b>beam</b> <b>spring</b> model to investigate the effects of connector strength, pattern and intensity. It was found a triangular distribution of shear connectors – more lumped near the ends – is more structurally efficient. Further validation of this model is required and economizing and simplifying this procedure is key to more widespread implementation of thermally efficient, structurally composite, precast concrete sandwich panel walls...|$|E

It is trapezoidal in shape with small steel tubes on each end. The location of the bolster spring seating is marked by two circular grooves in the center. A rubber washer is placed at the grooved section. The bolster spring sits on the rubber washer. The lower <b>spring</b> <b>beam</b> is also a free-floating structure. It is not bolted or welded either to the bogie frame or the bogie bolster. It {{is attached to the}} bogie frame on the outside {{with the help of a}} steel hanger.

A BSS pin is placed in the tubular section in the end portion of the lower <b>spring</b> <b>beam.</b> A hanger block is placed below the BSS pin. The BSS hanger in turn supports the hanger. This arrangement is done on all the four corners of the lower <b>spring</b> <b>beam.</b> The top end of the hanger also has a similar arrangement. However, instead of the BSS pin, steel brackets are welded on the lower side of the bogie frame of which the BSS hanger hangs with the help of hanger block.

30|$|Whereas, the {{application}} of MEMS probes {{are known to be}} superior in characterizing local force response of any interested cell (Figure 3 C). Being divided into two major groups, one dimensional (1 D) and two dimensional (2 D) cell probes have been used in the past in order to determine mechanical properties of single cell. The device as reported by Yang and Saif consists of a suspended probe of a pairs of compliant beam of known stiffness. As the piezoelectric actuator approaches the cell, the deflections of the beams were observed. Later, the applied force is calculated using the spring constant of the beams [45],[46]. This technique can be further improved with a coat of fibronectin to promote adhesion permits the observation of cell stretching [46]. Retrospectively, it is obvious that MEMS probes surpass the traditional AFM method in terms of reduced complexity and operates at lower cost although this technique bound to the uncertainties produced from the <b>beam</b> <b>spring</b> constant calibration.

The device comprises a shape memory alloy wire wound around a low-friction cylindrical drum contrasted by a backup <b>beam</b> <b>spring</b> and fitted to the output shaft through an overrunning clutch. Electrical heating produces a contraction of the wire, hence a rotation of the drum which is transferred to the shaft. Thanks to the overrunning clutch, during the recoiling phase, the drum rotates backward while the shaft does not move. Spurious backward movements of the shaft are contrasted by a second overrunning clutch linking the shaft to the frame. This article develops {{a model for the}} quasi-static simulation of the motor and the experimental characterization of a prototype device featuring three active drums, a rotary sensor and an angular brake to apply the external load.

40|$|A {{physical}} model {{was built to}} study {{the properties of the}} feeding strike of the mantis shrimp that are responsible for drag reduction and cavitation control. The model had three goals: 1) The model was to be outfitted with a method to collect kinematic, force and cavitation data. 2) The velocity and acceleration profile of the model were to be predicted with a mathematical model of the mechanism. 3) The model was to match as many drag and cavitation sensitive properties of the mantis shrimp strike as feasible and have a means to control the rest. The first iteration of the model met the first goal but not the second or third. It matched the strike in maximum velocity, appendage size and shape and environmental temperature and salinity but did not control acceleration profile, water quality or pressure. Data collected with high-speed video of strikes of the model and Gonodactylus smithii showed the model to cavitate at speeds at which no cavitation was seen in animal strikes.

In the improved numerical model, lining, joint, and junction surface, respectively, are simulated by <b>beam,</b> <b>spring,</b> and a combination of compression bar and spring. Through the comparison of the numerical analysis results of the improved model and existing models, {{it turns out that}} the defects or problems in {{the existing}} numerical models are resolved; tension appearance on the contact surface and junction surface and the abrupt change of bending moment in linings are solved in the improved model because the compression bar element and the coupling technology of node displacement in the junction surface is applied.

In this paper, the parameter formulas of element stiffness, applicable to the junction surface and contact surface of double lining, are given definitely, and the influence of the element amount of junction surface on the analysis results is discussed. Based on the improved numerical model, the mechanical behavior of the double lining of the Huangpu River Tunnel in China is studied, and some conclusions are obtained as follows. (1) The thickness increase of the double lining will clearly increase its bending moment, but it has little influence on its axial force. (2) The allocation proportion of the bending moment between the segment lining and secondary lining has no linear relationship with the ratio of the lining thickness...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there have}} been many {{applications}} involving shape memory alloy (SMA) to actuate or control small to large vibration in the field of aerospace, automobile, building structures, bioengineering devices, etc. The application of SMA over a wide field is due to its ability to apply large force and displacement with low power. It is also found that SMA can regain its original state after going through the cycle of heating and cooling processes. During the process of loading, the internal temperature change due to phase transformation which causes energy dissipation. Due to its effective energy dissipation capabilities, it can respond to slow loading, fast loading, sudden loading, and time varying loading, respectively. However, to understand the effective control of vibration of a structure, it is important to investigate its linear and nonlinear behavior under the different loadings conditions. In this thesis, we plan to investigate the linear and nonlinear response of SMA controlled cantiliver <b>beam</b> (<b>spring)</b> under different loading conditions. To do the study, we first present the thermomechanical constitutive model of SMA with a single degree of freedom system. Subsequently, we solve the equation to obtain linear frequency and nonlinear frequency response using the method of harmonic balance. To analyze the in uence of cubic and quadratic nonlinearity, we modify the governing equation and discuss the results based on the method of harmonic balance. Additionally, we also describe the method of averaging to obtain the nonlinear frequency response of SMA based oscillators. The analysis of results lead to various ways of controlling {{the nature and extent of}} nonlinear response of SMA based oscillators. Such findings can be effectively used to control the external vibration of different systems...|$|E

40|$|Cabinet {{vibrations}} during spinning {{cycles of}} washing machines are often perceived negatively by customers, both in acoustic and visual terms. Therefore, {{in a market}} that {{is more and more}} oriented towards customer satisfaction and appliance efficiency, reducing cabinet vibrations and noise is a very attractive target. Previous experimental campaigns have highlighted that currently installed dry-friction dampers have highly non-linear characteristics and they are the main source of broadband forcing on the cabinet panels. To overcome these negative effects, two innovative designs for the suspension system have been studied and are here presented: The first solution is a secondary suspension system, designed to filter out the high frequency force components introduced by the dampers and therefore to mitigate panel vibrations; the second solution is more radical and it consists in removing the existing dampers and to substitute them with a tuned mass damper (TMD), directly fixed to the oscillating group. These solutions are a compromise between cost and efficiency, since a linear oil damper would impact excessively on the final cost of the appliance. The secondary suspension system has been designed to meet the very strict requirements of the manufacturer: low cost (which implies small mass) and applicable to the existing machine without any modification of any part other than the dampers themselves. The desired results have been achieved increasing the mass of the damper rod and introducing a fixedfixed (or hinged-hinged) <b>beam</b> <b>spring.</b> The prototype of the secondary suspension has been tested independently and assembled in the washing machine, and the vibratory and acoustic results will be reported. The introduction of a TMD and the contextual removal of the dry-friction dampers, on the contrary, requires the modification of the oscillating group in order to work efficiently. As a matter of fact, a principle for the design of oscillating groups is the space optimization, which usually leads to asymmetric distributions of mass of the oscillating group, that in their turn lead to asymmetrically coupled mode shapes. This dynamic characteristic does not suit the design of a simple and compact TMD, with a limited number of degrees of freedom. We show that careful mass distribution and a specifically designed 2 -dofs TMD can efficiently substitute the original dampers. An elemental prototype of the so defined TMD has been tested on a shaking table, and it seems an effective alternative to classical suspension systems. Copyright © 2013 by ASME...|$|E
