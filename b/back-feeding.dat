At the time, the 1-B RAT was de-energized for maintenance and RAT 1-A was powering both trains of emergency electrical power, and the non-emergency electrical trains were being powered by <b>back-feeding</b> from the switchyard through the main step-up transformer to the 1-A and 1-B unit auxiliary transformers (UAT.) Additionally, Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) 1-B was out of service for planned maintenance. After the power loss, EDG 1-A failed to start due to a protective safety trip. The resulting {{loss of electrical power}} in the plant's [...] "vital circuits" [...] shut down the residual heat removal (RHR) pump that was cooling Unit 1 (which was nearing the end of a refueling outage) and prevented the back-up RHR from activating. Even though Unit 1 was offline at the time, residual heat from the natural decay of the radioactive fuel needed to be removed to prevent a dangerous rise in core temperature. While the non safety power was not interrupted, there was no physical connection between the vital and non-vital electrical trains which prevented the vital trains from receiving power from the unaffected path through the UATs.|$|E

Under {{the condition of the}} relative fragility of water environment, Kanasi should regard water environment as the core, reduce and avoid the external diseconomy of the tourism development, thus realize the environment and generational ecological balance and finally realize the virtuous coupling of the tourism industry and environment. This paper takes external safeguarding system, basic supporting system, environmental evaluation system and <b>back-feeding</b> mechanism into consideration and constructs a kind of coupling tourism development pattern: environment supporting of lake area - tourism development - evaluation of environment and <b>back-feeding,</b> which offers a new way of scenic area development. © 2009 IEEE.

50|$|Typically {{the network}} {{protector}} {{is set to}} close when the voltage difference and phase angle are such that the transformer will supply power to the secondary grid, and is set to open when the secondary grid would <b>back-feed</b> through the transformer and supply power to the primary circuit.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{an application of}} machine learning techniques toward the problem of predicting which network protector switch {{is the cause of}} an Alive on <b>Back-Feed</b> (ABF) event in the New York City power distribution system. When an electrical feeder is shut down, all network protector switches connected to the feeder should open to isolate the feeder. When a switch malfunctions and does not open, electrical current flows into the feeder, which remains energized. This causes the feeder to be “alive ” on <b>back-feed</b> current, and maintenance cannot proceed. Our goal is to provide a ranking of network protector switches according to their susceptibility to such malfunction. Such a ranking can assist prioritization of which switches to repair when an ABF event occurs. We compare three methods for computing a ranking: an SVM classification approach, a maximum entropy density estimation approach and an SVM-ranking approach. ...|$|R
40|$|Fault Passage Indicators (FPI) are a cost {{effective}} solution to improve reliability and power quality indexes in distribution grids, such as SAIDI and CAIDI. Directional problems, {{such as the}} <b>back-feed</b> current and the connection of Distributed Generators (DG) have triggered the need of Directional FPIs. The typical method for directionality is polarization, which implies the use of Voltage Sensors. However, the costs and difficulties of installing such sensors over the Distribution Network turns the directionality into an expensive necessity. Researchers and manufacturers {{have come up with}} directional voltage sensor-less solutions that make use only of inexpensive current sensors and alternative signal processing techniques. The paper provides an exhaustive literature review about those methods and a case study over a Belgian grid where some of those algorithms are implemented and tested. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Aurizon, Australia's largest {{rail freight}} operator, is {{introducing}} the Static Frequency Converter (SFC) technology into its electric railway network {{as part of}} the Bauhinia Electrification Project. The introduction of SFCs has significant implications on the protection systems of the 50 kV traction network. The traditional distance protection calculation method does not work in this configuration because of the effect that the SFC in combination with the remote grid has on the apparent impedance, and was substantially reviewed. The standard overcurrent (OC) protection scheme is not suitable due to the minimum fault level being below the maximum load level and was revised to incorporate directionality and under-voltage inhibit. Delta protection was reviewed to improve sensitivity. A new protection function was introduced to prevent <b>back-feeding</b> faults in the transmission network through the grid connection. Protection inter-tripping was included to ensure selectivity between the SFC protection and the system downstream...|$|E
40|$|A migra??o em massa do homem do campo para as cidades ao longo da segunda metade do s?culo XX, de certo modo, relaciona-se com a escassez de pol?ticas p?blicas destinadas para o meio rural e o aumento de investimentos para o meio urbano, retroalimentando o ciclo vicioso do caos urbano e do pouco desenvolvimento das pequenas cidades e dos campos no {{interior}} do pa?s. A fim de melhorar as condi??es de vida das fam?lias agricultoras e fixar os camponeses na zona rural, em 1999 foi implantado o Programa Nacional de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar PRONAF. Em 2004, novas linhas de cr?dito foram implantadas, dentre elas, o PRONAF jovem que ? uma categoria especial para incentivar a perman?ncia de jovens no meio rural. Destina-se aos filhos de agricultores entre 16 e 29 anos e objetiva fomentar o futuro da agricultura brasileira e combater o ?xodo rural. Pretende-se neste estudo verificar o impacto deste programa sobre a qualidade de vida subjetiva (QVS) e o bem-estar subjetivo (BES) dos jovens beneficiados, comparando-os com um grupo controle natural, bem como sobre suas condi??es de vida e trabalho, considerando as condi??es edafoclim?ticas a que est?o submetidos. A QVS ? a forma como o indiv?duo avalia sua posi??o na vida, no seu contexto cultural e s?cio-econ?mico e em rela??o a suas expectativas e objetivos. O BES refere-se ? forma como as pessoas avaliam suas vidas, sendo esta composta por um conjunto de respostas emocionais, o balan?o dos afetos positivos e negativos, e cognitivas acerca da satisfa??o com a vida do indiv?duo. Participaram 400 sujeitos, dos quais 200 residem no sert?o e 200 residem no brejo paraibano, distribu?dos equitativamente por sexo. Utilizou-se o WHOQOL-Bref, para avaliar a QVS, a escala de satisfa??o com a vida e a escala de afetos, para avaliar o BES, todas adaptadas e validadas para esta popula??o. A coleta de dados foi realizada em suas resid?ncias e locais de trabalho, obedecendo aos princ?pios ?ticos referentes ? pesquisa com seres humanos. Os resultados apontam para ?ndices satisfat?rios de QVS e BES entre os jovens agricultores, por?m n?o h? impacto significativo do PRONAF sobre estes construtos. Apesar disso o programa foi avaliado positivamente tanto pelos n?o-beneficiados como pelos beneficiados que apontam melhoria nas condi??es de vida e de trabalho. Verificou-se que o PRONAF Jovem n?o tem atingido o p?blico-alvo ao qual se destina nas regi?es estudadas. A divulga??o ? realizada principalmente atrav?s dos sindicatos e associa??es e o acesso ao cr?dito foi considerado f?cil pela maioria. A aplicabilidade dos recursos acontece de forma diferenciada entre os residentes na zona ?mida, que investem em gado de leite, e na zona seca, que aplicam em artesanato. O pagamento do benef?cio foi ou est? sendo efetuado sem dificuldades pela grande maioria. O impacto do PRONAF deve ser considerado, contudo este ? insuficiente para garantir o cumprimento adequado dos objetivos propostos pelo programa. Apesar de exercer influ?ncia positiva sobre seu p?blico-alvo, esta n?o ? bastante para transformar a realidade dos jovens agricultores. Este estudo contribuiu para uma avalia??o dos impactos do PRONAF, fornecendo informa??es que possibilitam mudan?as e melhorias na aplica??o dos investimentos do Estado. Al?m disso, promoveu reflex?es sobre as reais condi??es em que vivem atualmente os jovens residentes no campo, al?m da amplia??o do corpo te?rico e cient?fico para estudos sobre o ambiente rural e mais especificamente para a psicologia, com subs?dios te?ricos para o entendimento do ambiente e dos brasileiros que residem no meio rural. Mass {{migration of}} {{man from the}} countryside to cities throughout {{the second half of}} the twentieth century, in a sense, relates to the lack of public policies for rural areas and increasing investment in the urban setting, <b>back-feeding</b> the vicious cycle of urban chaos and little development of small towns and camps inside the country. In order to improve the living conditions of family farmers and peasants set in the countryside in 1999 was implemented the National Program to Strengthen Family Agriculture - PRONAF. In 2004, new credit lines were established, among them, PRONAF young man who is a special category to encourage youth to stay in rural areas. It is intended for children of farmers between 16 and 29 years and aims to promote the future of Brazilian agriculture and combating rural depopulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of this program on the quality of life (QVS) and subjective well-being (BES) of the young recipients, comparing them with a natural control group, as well as their conditions of life and work, considering the environmental conditions they face. The QVS is how the individual assesses his position in life in its cultural context and socio-economic and in relation to their expectations and goals. BES refers to how people evaluate their lives, composed by a set of emotional responses, the balance of positive affect and negative, about the cognitive and life satisfaction of the individual. There were 400 subjects, 200 residents in the hinterland and 200 residents of the swamp Paraiba, evenly distributed by gender. We used the WHOQOL-Bref, to assess the QVS, the scale of life satisfaction and affect scale, to assess the BES, all adapted and validated for this population. Data collection was performed in their homes and workplaces, and observing the ethical principles regarding research with human beings. The results indicate satisfactory levels of QVS and BES among young farmers, but there is no significant impact PRONAF on these constructs. Yet the program was evaluated positively by both non-beneficiaries and the benefit that point improvement in living conditions and work. It was found that PRONAF Young has reached the target audience to which it is intended in the regions studied. Being released mainly by unions and associations, access to credit was considered easy by most. The applicability of resources happens differently between residents in the wetlands, which invest in dairy cattle, and in the dry zone, which apply in crafts. The payment of the benefit has been or is being carried out without difficulty by the majority. The impact of PRONAF should be considered, however this is insufficient to ensure proper enforcement of the objectives proposed by the program. Despite positive influence on your audience, this is not enough to transform the reality of young farmers. This study seeks to contribute to an assessment of the impacts of PRONAF, in order to improve the implementation of state investments. Also, try to reflect on the actual conditions under which young people are currently living residents in the field besides the expansion of the theoretical and scientific studies for the rural environment and more specifically to psychology, with theoretical foundations for understanding the environment and Brazilians who live in rural areas...|$|E
50|$|Soon reports {{came into}} the station that showed the {{widespread}} extent of the blackout. WCRB engineering checked the amount of diesel fuel remaining {{and found that it}} might not last more than a few more hours. The fuel vendor was notified, but there was no fuel available. A radio engineer started driving around and discovered that Civil Defense was trying to get a portable generator running which they had connected to the Waltham Hospital (since renamed). The hospital had no power, and the only generator available would not run. WCRB’s station engineer suggested that the electric company <b>back-feed</b> power from WCRB to the hospital, using the existing distribution lines but disconnecting everybody else. The hospital was on Hope Avenue, off South Street, {{on the other side of}} Brandeis University. WCRB successfully fed power to the hospital, and the fuel from the inoperative generator was transferred to WCRB’s tank. Within a few hours, WCRB had its fuel tank filled from additional donations. To have enough power available to supply the hospital, it became necessary to shut down the AM transmitter.|$|R
40|$|Network {{reconfiguration}} {{is one of}} {{the electricity}} network optimization techniques for losses reduction and load balancing by changing the open-closed status of sectionalized switches. In this paper, an application of network reconfiguration in low-voltage (LV) domestic distribution network with high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) is presented. Firstly, high resolution time-series domestic load profiles are generated and validated with measured data at substation. Electric vehicle charging profiles at both fast and slow charging modes are modelled and produced. Then the impact of increasing penetration of EVs on the network thermal and voltage constraints is quantified. To optimize the network topology, suitable locations of newly-installed switches and their operational time are identified by branch-exchange method and exhaustive search algorithm (ESA) due to the small size of network and less potential location. The proposed approach is applied to two practical 400 V LV distribution networks interconnected by underground linkboxes which are used to provide <b>back-feeds</b> during routine maintenances or emergency conditions. By adding new sectionalized switches, the LV network will obtain more operational flexibility and could better explore its potential for further study under Smart Grid scenarios...|$|R
50|$|Many {{people use}} {{generators}} to supplement {{power to a}} home or business {{in the event that}} main (municipal) power has gone offline. In order to safely transfer the power source from a generator (and back to main), a safety interlock is often employed. The interlock consists of one or more switches that prevent both main power and generator power from powering the dwelling simultaneously. Without this safeguard, both power sources running at once could cause an overload condition, or generator power <b>back-feed</b> onto the main could cause dangerous voltage to reach a lineman repairing the main feed far outside the building. An interlock device is designed to allow a generator to provide backup power {{in such a way that}} it (a) prevents main and generator power to be connected at the same time, and (b) allows circuit breakers to operate normally without interference in the event of any overload condition. Most interlock devices for electrical systems employ a mechanical device to manage movement of circuit breakers. Some also allow for the use of padlocks to prevent someone from accidentally activating the main power system without authorization.|$|R
40|$|The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NX region) of Northwestern China is {{threatened}} by increased meteorological drought induced by climate change (CC) and constraints on water supply from the Yellow River. Thus, the NX region is representative of attempts to adapt to CC and variability in China’s arid regions. Field visits, a questionnaire and in situ inspections were conducted in 2012 – 2014 to understand people’s perception and awareness of drought and its impact, {{particularly with respect to}} adaptation strategies. We mainly focused on drought adaptation actions and planning implemented at the government level under the double pressures of drought and allocation. We described a suitable adaptation pathway for socio-economic sustainable development and discussed existing adaptation barriers. Construction of modern efficient water-saving agriculture lies at the core of drought adaptation, with socio-economic sustainable development being the ultimate goal. To achieve this, policies and institutional, engineering, technological, structural and social initiatives and measures—classified into macro adaptation strategies and specific coping measures—are implemented. Adaptation often encounters obstacles, e. g., policy issues from household contract responsibility systems, funding difficulties of low-income farmers, traditional behavioral habits and low education and literacy levels among farmers. The adaptation pathway involves the construction of modern efficient water-saving agriculture. Agricultural water savings are then transferred to developed industries, which <b>back-feed</b> socio-economic sustainable development in the NX region...|$|R
40|$|A semiautomated {{method for}} reconstructing objects from serial thin {{sections}} {{has been developed}} in the Biocomputation Center. The method {{is being used to}} completely, for the first time, type II hair cells and their innervations. The purposes are {{to learn more about the}} fundamental circuitry of the macula on Earth and to determine whether changes in connectivities occur under space flight conditions. Data captured directly from a transmission electron microscope via a video camera are sent to a graphics workstation. There, the digitized micrographs are mosaicked into sections and contours are traced, registered and displayed by semiautomated methods. Current reconstructions are of type II cells from the medial part of rat maculas collected in-flight on the Space Life Sciences- 2 mission, 4. 5 hrs post-flight, and from a ground control. Results show that typical type II cells receive processes from tip to six nearby calyces or afferents. Nearly all processes are elongated and have bouton-like enlargements; some have numerous vesicles. Multiple (2 to 4) processes from a single calyx to a type II cell are common, and approximately 1 / 3 of the processes innervale 2 or 3 type II cells or a neighboring cluster. From 2 % to 6 % of the cells resemble type I cells morphologically but have demi-calyces. Thus far, increments in synaptic number in type II cells of flight rats are prominent along processes that supply two hair cells. It is clear that reconstruction methods provide insights into details of macular circuitry not obtainable by other techniques. The results demonstrate a morphological basis for interactions between adjacent receptive fields through feed <b>back-feed</b> forward connections, and for dynamic alterations in receptive field range and activity during preprocessing of linear acceleratory information by the maculas. The reconstruction method we have developed will find further applications in the study of the details of neuronal architecture of more complex systems, to seek out shared organizational properties or neuronal networks and to understand better localization of synaptic changes in altered environments...|$|R
