50|$|DAC {{word length}}s range usually from 6 to 10 bits. The SRAM's word length {{is three times}} the DAC's word length. The SRAM acts as a color lookup table (CLUT). It usually has 256 entries (and thus an 8-bit address). If the DAC's word length is also 8 bits, we have a 256 x 24-bit SRAM which allows a {{selection}} of 256 out of 16777216 (16,7 million) possible colors for the display. The contents of this SRAM can be altered when no pixel needs to be generated for transmission to the display. A synchronization pulse is required to maintain vertical picture stability. Therefore, a vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>pulse</b> is generated for every frame. This vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>pulse</b> is not visible on the display, nor is any pixel sent. Therefore, the D/A is idle and can allow the user to modify the SRAM color lookup table.|$|E

40|$|When pulsed {{interference}} is mitigated {{by means of}} <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking,</b> interference is reduced significantly. However, {{at the same time}} certain fractions of the useful orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal are erased. Consequently, only moderate improvements are achieved with <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking.</b> When representing the <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> operation as multiplication with a rectangular window exhibiting notches at the positions where blanks are inserted, it becomes obvious, that <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> mainly leads to inter-carrier interference (ICI). In this paper, the compensation of the impact of <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> is proposed by reconstructing and subtracting ICI. The required shape of the subcarrier spectra is derived from the <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> window. For an estimation of the transmitted data symbols and the channel coefficients of each subcarrier an iterative receiver structure is proposed. Simulation results at hand of a realistic interference scenario show that with perfect channel estimation and known data symbols the impact of <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> can be reduced to a small loss in signal-to-noise ratio resulting from the energy loss due to erasing a certain fraction of the OFDM signal. With real channel estimation and estimated data symbols, the ideal case with perfect channel estimation and known data symbols is approached by 1. 2 dB after only three iterations...|$|R
30|$|To {{suppress}} {{the effect of}} impulsive noise on an OFDM receiver, an interference mitigation method based on <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> is first proposed in [4 – 6]. However, when using this method to an actual system, two problems should be considered, the threshold of <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> and the compensation of inter-carrier interference (ICI) caused by <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking.</b> To calculate the blanking threshold, an optimal threshold of <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> is derived based on an expression for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the blanking nonlinearity [7]. With maximizing the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) criterion, an adaptive blanking threshold for the OFDM receiver is also proposed in [8]. To eliminate the ICI caused by <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking,</b> an iterative reconstructing and subtracting ICI method is proposed in [9, 10], and a frequency-domain ICI compensation scheme based on finite impulse response equalizer is proposed in [11].|$|R

This project seeks to use advanced signal processing to develop a generic noise blanking technique suitable {{for a new generation}} of mobile radio equipment to be developed by Motorola Australia. The project involves an analysis of impulsive noise sources (car ignitions, overhead powerlines etc), a review of existing noise blanking techniques, which will then lead to the development of an appropriate noise blanking technique suitable for the impending deregulated environment.

40|$|Four Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are {{scheduled}} to be fully operational orbiting the Earth in the coming years. A considerably high number of signals, coming from each of the satellites that will constitute those constellations, will share the radio electric spectrum. Aeronautical Radio Navigation Systems (ARNS) share the E 5 Galileo band. Examples of ARNS are Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) and Tactical Air Navigation system (TACAN). It should also be mentioned that electronic attacks (jamming or spoofing) have always been a latent threat for satellite services. All of this are important interference sources which can partially or completely disable a GNSS system. These interferences must be, and are currently being studied together with interference mitigation methods. The aim of the work presented in this thesis is to study the narrowband interference effects in Galileo E 5 band and to assess three mitigation techniques against two types of narrowband interferences, Continuous Wave Interference (CWI) and DME signals. Cancellation techniques can be classified into two major groups: time-domain approaches and frequency-domain approaches. Methods that combine time and frequency together are also given in the literature (e. g. cyclostationarity-based methods) but their implementations are very costly with high sampling rates as those used for example in Galileo E 5 signals. The mitigation techniques that are addressed in this thesis are zeroing, dynamic notch filtering and <b>blanking</b> <b>pulse</b> methods. All of them can be understood as filtering techniques that remove any signal above a certain threshold. This thesis shows that zeroing is more suitable for CWI and blanking is better against DME signals. These techniques have been developed within a Matlab-Simulink based simulator initiated in 2007 at Tampere University of Technology. The implemented simulator could be a great help tool for future research and development projects...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a doubly {{iterative}} receiver for orthogonal {{frequency-division multiplexing}} (OFDM) systems {{is designed to}} mitigate impulsive interference based on <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking.</b> Although being a very efficient countermeasure, <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> introduces intercarrier interference in OFDM systems leading to system performance degradation. The doubly iterative receiver is designed to overcome this drawback. The inner loop combines iterative demodulation and decoding to cancel intercarrier interference. To make soft information available to the outer loop, the equivalent noise power is derived to employ soft demodulation. The outer loop improves the performance of <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> by performing a hypothesis test, {{which is used to}} decide if peaks in the received signal are due to impulsive interference or the large peak-to-average-power ratio common to OFDM signals. This allows to optimize the blanking threshold through maximizing the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. To evaluate performance and complexity of the proposed receiver, extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis is carried out, where EXIT functions for <b>pulse</b> <b>blanker,</b> demodulator, and decoder are derived.

This paper documents the complete sequence of facts in a real environment, from the interference detection, time/frequency analysis, source identification and location to the mitigation of its effects by implementing a real-time <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> algorithm in an open source, software defined GNSS receiver. The vulnerability of general purpose front-ends to strong out-ofband interferences due to lack of selectivity and component non-linearities was also evidenced, which is specially concerning for Software Defined Radio (SDR) receiver users. In order to assess the interference protection options of a receiver, three input filter blocks have been implemented and integrated into the open source GNSS-SDR receiver. These signal processing blocks aim to mitigate two common types of interferences: continuous wave FM modulated and short-time pulsed ones. Two blocks deal with the CW interferences, implementing an adaptive Notch filter interference canceler. The first implementation performs a very effective mitigation of CW interferences even in cases of very fast instantaneous frequency variations. The second implementation requires less computational resources and is valid only when the instantaneous frequency changes relatively slowly. The third block is a <b>Pulse</b> <b>Blanking</b> filter that mitigates pulsed interferences. Both algorithm implementations were tested with real GNSS signals.

40|$|A {{number of}} antenna array {{techniques}} for radio interference mitigation in GNSS receivers have been intensively {{studied in the}} last two decades showing that space-only or space-time adaptive processing allows for significant improvements. These investigations were primarily focused on mitigation of continuous interference signals assumed to be of intentional nature in the “quiet” GPS L 1 band. In contrast to the L 1 band, new navigation signals of GPS/Galileo L 5 /E 5 frequency band have to share the radio spectrum with several civil and military radar systems. In a single-antenna GNSS receiver, the pulsed interference originated from such radar systems is usually handled by using the <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> or frequency extinction techniques. In an antenna array system, more efficient mitigation of pulsed interference can be obtained by adding the spatial domain to the signal processing. In this case, the GNSS antenna array receiver may be designed in a way that allows for simultaneous mitigation of continuous and pulsed interferers. In the paper the performance of two space-time adaptive processing (STAP) techniques has been investigated in interference scenarios with continuous and pulsed sources by using the simulations of a software multi-antenna receiver. It has been shown that the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) processor with a corresponding directional constrain delivers both a good performance in term of code and Doppler receiver tracking errors and minimal distortions of the useful GNSS signal.
