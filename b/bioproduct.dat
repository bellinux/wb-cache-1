50|$|Land may be {{marginal}} for {{a number}} of reasons, including poor water supply, poor soil quality, pollution from previous industrial activities, terrain challenges such as excessive slope, or excessive distance from means of transportation.Marginal land is not entirely useless for human purposes. For example, certain breeds of free-roaming livestock, such as the English Leicester sheep, are able to forage on such land. There are also some plants that can be grown in land that would be considered marginal for most agricultural uses. For example, cucurbita foetidissima, the buffalo gourd, is well adapted to marginal agricultural lands such as sandy loam soils which have to be well-drained. Land that is marginal for conventional row-crop production is often well-suited to perennial crops, including low-input crops grown as bioenergy or <b>bioproduct</b> feedtocks such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), shrub willow (Salix spp.), and giant miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus), allowing production of these crops without inducing competition for prime farmlands.|$|E

N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria represent a prolific bioproducts source with reduced cultivation costs. In this study, 1 [*]L cultures of the N 2 -fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena siamensis grown diazotrophically in the WAVE™ bioreactor exhibited increased phosphate consumption and 37 – 70 % higher CO 2 fixation rates than those grown in conventional bubbled suspension (BS) batch cultures. This generated 40 – 80 % increased biomass productivities in the WAVE™ bioreactor reaching 60 [*]mg[*]L− 1 [*]day− 1 when supplemented with 10 % CO 2. Consequently, WAVE™ generated 36 – 153 % more protein, lipid, and carbohydrate than BS, including 47 – 100 % increased productivity of phycocyanin and stearidonic acid (SA) with relevant biomedical applications. While the type of culture system (BS or WAVE™) {{did not affect the}} biochemical profile of cyanobacterial biomass, 10 % CO 2 supplementation induced a significant decrease in fatty acids and phycocyanin contents (mg[*]g− 1 [*]DW).

Thamnidium elegans {{was selected as}} a production strain {{and a variety of}} cereal materials were tested with the emphasis on achieving cereal-based bioproducts with high GLA content. It was found that dry substrate/water mass ratio of 1 : 1. 5 was optimal for GLA formation. Also, the addition of spent malt grains (SMG) as an internal support to substrates at a mass ratio of 1 : 3 increased lipid accumulation in bioproducts up to 1. 5 -fold and GLA yield in <b>bioproduct</b> up to 4 -fold. The study revealed that linoleic acid in substrates mixed with SMG was more efficiently transformed to GLA than without SMG. Similarly, an increase in the concentration of linoleic acid in fatty acids of substrates mixed with SMG was accompanied by direct GLA accumulation in <b>bioproduct.</b> Fungal growth on the mixture of wheat bran and SMG (3 : 1) and on the mixture of spelt wheat flakes and SMG (3 : 1) resulted in maximal level of GLA in fatty acids (13 – 14 %).
