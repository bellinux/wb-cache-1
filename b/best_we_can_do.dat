25|$|Karl Popper {{tried to}} {{establish}} a criterion of demarcation between science and metaphysics, but the speculative turn taken by certain developments in theoretical physics has contributed to muddle the issue again. Mosterín has been concerned {{with the question of}} the reliability of theories and claims. He makes a distinction between the standard core of a scientific discipline, that at a certain point in time should only include relatively reliable and empirically supported ideas, and the cloud of speculative hypotheses surrounding it. Part of the theoretical progress consists in the incorporation of newly tested hypotheses of the cloud to the standard core. In this connection, he has analyzed epistemic notions like detection and observation. Observation, but not detection, is accompanied by awareness. Detection is always mediated by technological instruments, but observation only sometimes (like glasses in vision). The signals received by detectors have to be transduced into types of energy accessible to our senses. Following the path open by Patrick Suppes, Mosterín has paid much attention to the structure of metric concepts, because of their indispensable mediating role at the interface between theory and observation where reliability is tested. He has also made contributions to the study of mathematical modeling and of the limits of the axiomatic method in the characterization of real-world structures. The real world is extremely complex, and sometimes the <b>best</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to apply the method of theoretical science: to pick up in the set-theoretical universe a mathematical structure with some formal similarities with the situation we are interested in, {{and use it as a}} model of that parcel of the world. Together with Roberto Torretti, Mosterín has written a uniquely comprehensive encyclopedic dictionary of logic and philosophy of science.|$|E
500|$|The discoverers {{named the}} new element after the {{university}} and the state. This was a break from the convention used for elements 95 to 97, which drew inspiration from how the elements directly above them in the periodic table were named. However, the element directly above element98 in the periodic table, dysprosium, has a name that simply means [...] "hard to get at" [...] so the researchers decided to set aside the informal naming convention. They added that [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to point out ... searchers a century ago found it difficult to get to California." ...|$|E
500|$|Ritvo {{then moved}} Mucho Macho Man to Santa Anita Park {{almost two months}} before the Breeders' Cup races because she felt he [...] "thrived" [...] in California. It was a major {{commitment}} for the horse's team, as Ritvo, Green, Petro, Tapia and Lopez had to leave their home base in Florida, and Reeves had to cover the expenses. Dean Reeves said, [...] "Everybody has basically put their lives and their family second to the benefit and the <b>best</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for Macho." [...] The horse's next race was the Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita on September 28. [...] Because both Smith and Prado had prior riding commitments, Ritvo and Green decided to contact Gary Stevens. Stevens' contribution to the human interest saga included a comeback in 2013 after having been forced to retire seven years earlier due to debilitating knee pain. He also had his own near-death experience, having survived a major riding accident in 2003. [...] In a twist of serendipity, Stevens' agent, Craig O'Brien, came by the barn to inquire about the horse's availability about the same time Ritvo and Green had decided to see if Stevens was available. Stevens later claimed to be unaware of his agent's machinations. Noting that Stevens had portrayed Seabiscuit's jockey George Woolf in the eponymous film, Ritvo later joked, [...] "I was in Hollywood. How could I not use a film star?" [...] In the course of the Awesome Again, Mucho Macho Man settled behind the leaders before making a bid on the final turn. The horse led by three lengths in the homestretch, and accelerated clear of the field to win easily by [...] lengths over Paynter. It was his first win in 2013 and his first Grade I stakes win. [...] The victory was also a [...] "win and you're in" [...] qualifying race for the Breeders' Cup Classic, which included a waiver of the $100,000 entry fee for the Classic.|$|E

500|$|The Guardians Andrew Pulver {{was less}} enthusiastic, calling the film {{a mix of}} [...] "wafer-thin psychodrama" [...] and [...] "plot-generator dialogue". Times Richard Corliss said the action was let down by [...] "inert" [...] drama, {{describing}} the film as [...] "45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome." [...] Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films. The New Yorkers Anthony Lane's verdict read as [...] "It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating [...] "If this is the <b>best</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> in terms of movies—hoif something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs {{and see what they}} come up with… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer…Why go to the movies to look at somebody else's computer after looking at your own all week?… The actors can't make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain." [...] Slant Magazines Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: [...] "a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle". The Wraps Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a [...] "charisma black hole". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences [...] "five IQ points out of five" [...] as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.|$|E
2500|$|Australia's Rod Marsh blamed England coach Keith Fletcher for {{the poor}} {{performances}} and for a negative attitude towards the series, criticising the coach's press conference comments in Adelaide. [...] "A team must always, always, play to win {{and even if you}} think that way you should never say it," [...] he told radio listeners. [...] "'The <b>best</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is an honourable draw' – what a load of codswallop. If anyone is wondering why England have had such a hard time in Australia, there lies the answer", but Fletcher refused to quit, citing a string of injuries and illnesses that had hampered the tour as the main cause of the team's lack of success and defending the inclusion of Gooch and Gatting, noting that [...] "indsight is a brilliant thing, but there was not one person who would have left Graham at home {{at the start of the}} tour." ...|$|E
2500|$|Now {{consider}} {{the example of}} a coin toss. Assuming the probability of heads {{is the same as the}} probability of tails, then the entropy of the coin toss is as high as it could be. This is because there is no way to predict the outcome of the coin toss ahead of time: if we have to choose, the <b>best</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is predict that the coin will come up heads, and this prediction will be correct with probability 1/2. Such a coin toss has one bit of entropy since there are two possible outcomes that occur with equal probability, and learning the actual outcome contains one bit of information. In contrast, a coin toss using a coin that has two heads and no tails has zero entropy since the coin will always come up heads, and the outcome can be predicted perfectly. Analogously, one binary-outcome with equiprobable values has a Shannon entropy of [...] bit. Similarly, one trit with equiprobable values contains [...] (about 1.58496) bits of information because it can have one of three values.|$|E
