Pillow lace, called so because of the pillow used to produce handmade <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace.</b> <b>Machines</b> based on his original designs are still in operation today producing fabrics in Perry Street, Chard, Somerset, UK.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> {{ground is}} the regular small mesh filling the open spaces of {{continuous}} <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace.</b> Other names for <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> ground are net or réseau (French for network).

40|$|AbstractPeniche's <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> {{has been}} a victim of the lack of demand for the product and the {{decrease}} of artisans who wish to manufacture it. The <b>Bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> is primarily generated on a small scale and most of the times for personal consumption. Apart from a few occasional orders these are the reasons that still maintain the artisanal production of <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace.</b> Identifying the problem of discontinuity of traditions and the lack of framing of these with contemporaneity arises combined with the remoteness of younger generations. In what design can it contribute to change this mercantile perspective?Getting the lace makers motivated for the production of different types of <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace,</b> using new materials, preserving {{at the same time the}} cultural heritage, it will be, in our opinion, one of the opportunities to reverse its decline status. We also believe on developing contemporary products to appeal the younger consumers, we’ll be capable of doing a direct association with <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace.</b> Therefore, the <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> could be associated to other components outside the textile context by creating objects with materials like iron, plastic or rubber, not merely ornamental, but useful to the eyes of the final consumer. This resignification of the <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> appeals to another meaning, more contemporary than the usual napro...|$|R
50|$|The {{making of}} <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> {{was easier to}} learn than the {{elaborate}} cutwork of the 16th century, and the tools and materials for making linen <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> were inexpensive. There was a ready market for <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> of all qualities, and women throughout Europe soon took up the craft which earned a better income than spinning, sewing, weaving or other home-based textile arts. Bobbin lace-making was established in charity schools, almshouses, and convents.|$|R
50|$|Elements of <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> {{may include}} toile or toilé (clothwork), réseau (the net-like ground of {{continuous}} lace), fillings of part laces, tapes, gimp, picots, tallies, ribs and rolls. Not all styles of <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> include all these elements.|$|R

40|$|<b>Bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> is a fibre {{art form}} in which {{intricate}} and delicate patterns are created by braiding together many threads. An overview of how <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> is made is presented and illustrated with a simple, traditional bookmark design. Research on the topology of textiles and braid theory form a base for the current work and is briefly summarized. We define a new mathematical model that supports the enumeration and generation of <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> patterns using an intelligent combinatorial search. Results of this new approach are presented and, by comparison to existing <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> patterns, it is demonstrated that this model reveals new patterns {{that have never been}} seen before. Finally, we apply our new patterns to an original bookmark design and propose future areas for exploration.

5000|$|The {{forerunner of}} {{bobbinet}} tulle was <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace.</b> Lace has been produced {{for a long}} time, made in tedious hand labour with thin thread and needles or <b>bobbins.</b> <b>Bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> is made by weaving the threads by moving the bobbins over or under each other. Much <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> {{is based on a}} net ground. By the end of the 18th century, people tried to produce the net ground mechanically. In 1765 they managed to create a tulle-like fabric on a so-called stocking framework. It took, however, some more years until the first real tulle could be produced mechanically.|$|R

Coarse passements of gold and silver-wrapped threads or colored silks gradually became finer, and later bleached linen yarn was used to make both braids and edgings.|$|R
50|$|Mesh {{grounded}} lace is {{a continuous}} <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> {{also known as}} straight <b>lace.</b> Continuous <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> is made in one piece on a lace pillow.

5000|$|<b>Bobbin</b> <b>lace,</b> as {{the name}} suggests, is made with bobbins and a pillow.
