40|$|In Iris fulva, the apical flower on an {{inflorescence}} opens first, and {{the flowering}} sequence then {{proceeds from the}} most <b>basal</b> <b>flower</b> upward to the apex (acropetally). Flowering order and flower position are thus partially decoupled, and this provides an opportunity to separately investigate {{the effects of these}} two factors upon fruit formation. We recorded natural patterns of fruit set and seed production, and found that fruit set patterns were determined by {{what appears to be a}} form of apical dominance. The first, apical flower had the highest fruit set and seed production. Fruit set decreased towards the base of the inflorescence, with later-opening flowers having a higher fruit set. This is contrary to the pattern usually observed in other acropetally flowering plants, which is a higher fruit set for basal, early flowers. By performing additional hand pollinations and counting pollen grains on naturally pollinated flowers, we found that pollen deposition was not a major factor limiting fruit set, and that it could not explain the large difference in fruit set between the apical and basal flowers. Removing the first flower after it had wilted increased fruit set in the remaining flowers, but mainly in the more apical flowers. only by removing the two topmost flowers could we obtain an increase in fruit set for the <b>basal</b> <b>flower.</b> The fact that the <b>basal</b> <b>flower</b> rarely sets fruit, despite being closer to resources, suggests that the apical meristem is either a strong sink for resources or produces hormones that form a gradient along the inflorescence, which is comparable with apical dominance...|$|E
40|$|As {{explained}} in Takhtajan’s preface {{this book is}} not a mere translation of his ‘The origin of Angiospermous plants’ (1961, in Russian), but an entirely new book. I find this true and not true. Comparing it with the Origin (1958 translation of the 1954 Russian version) {{the essence of the}} new book was there given in a nutshell. In size, chapter subjects, argumentation, and bibliographic documentation, the work is very much extended and it makes very interesting reading indeed. The sequence of the chapters is logical, almost always leading to distinct synthesis. Properly it is a critical commented survey of many opinions — Takhtajan being clearly in complete command of the huge literature on the subject — but from which the author follows his own line of choice and judgement, accepting or rejecting with brief but clear comments. The whole argumentation is admirably concise and rouses admiration for covering this vast subject, comprising taxonomy, plant distribution, morphology, palynology, genetics, population dynamics, flower biology, anatomy, paleozoology, etc. Major questions are embodied in subsequent paragraphs: polyphyletism is rejected; ancestors must be sought among heterosporous ferns or fern-like plants followed by pteridosperms and certain gymnosperms, although direct ancestors cannot be indicated; the <b>basal</b> <b>flower</b> type of angiosperms was bisexual. Takhtajan attaches great importance to occurrence of plants in small populations, especially in mountain plants, facilitating chance variations and genetic drift, rapid spread of mutant genes, which is important for evolution. This entails that missing links are almost never fossilized. Micro-evolution is equalized with macro-evolution. Neoteny (on which Takhtajan devoted a former work) can lead to despecialisation through which phenotypic simplification the complexity of the genome remains intact; it may provide for a maximum phenotypic effect by a minimal genotypic change. Primitive wood structure of early Winteraceous angiosperms is understandable by neotenic origin. Evolution of angiosperms was not only rapid, but also discontinuous as a result of neoteny. Developing in the mountains ‘in many [...] . small [...] . populations [...] . the earliest angiosperms found themselves under conditions most favourable to evolutionary radiation. And if we bear in mind that their evolution was closely tied to the evolution of insects and was based on the complex and peculiar mechanism of mutual selection, then the extraordinary speed of their initial differentiation becomes even more readily understandable. ’ Protection of the ovules arose as a selection against damage by ‘early pollinating insects’; this made simplification of their structure possible which led to smaller ovules (loss of thickened integuments, sclerotesta, etc.) and enabled the angiosperms to observe the greatest economy of material in construction of the ovules and ♀ gametophyte, and it also made possible the perfection of the process of pollination. ‘The acquisition of the stigma was undoubtedly a very great event in the evolutionary history of seedplants. ’ ‘The primitive insects searched for pollen (beetles), nectar searching ones were a further perfection; this again led to a very great advance in cross-pollination; and as a corollary to a greatly increased rate of evolution, which still continues. ’ ‘Isolation of a population is well known to be a prelude to the formation of a new species. ’ The question of the hypothetical reconstruction of the first flowering plants is approached by the ‘hypothetico-deductive method’. Knowing the basic evolutionary pathways of angiosperms and the main lines of specialisation of their organs and tissues, we may by extrapolation extend these lines mentally into the past to the lowest possible level of specialisation’, but somewhat further on he writes ‘This reconstruction of the ancestors of the living angiosperms depends on the truth of the assumption that they combined in one plant all the most archaic characters that are now found distributed among the living fossils. ’ I have italicized in the citations two words that are in contradiction; furthermore I would {{like to point out that}} whereas each plant we know possesses both primitive and derived characters, we cannot make an exception for an ancestral plant; one which would contain all the archaic characters must logically be an idealized fiction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Floral traits within {{plants can}} vary with flower {{position}} or flowering time. Within an inflorescence, sexual allocation of early produced <b>basal</b> <b>flowers</b> is often female-biased while later produced distal flowers are male-biased. Such temporal adjustment of floral resource {{has been considered}} one of the potential advantages of modularity (regarding a flower as a module) in hermaphrodites. However, flowers are under constraints of independent evolution of a given trait. To understand flower diversification within inflorescences, here we examine variation and covariation in floral traits within racemes at the individual and the maternal family level respectively in an alpine herb Aconitum gymnandrum (Ranunculaceae). Results We found that floral traits varied significantly with flower position and among families, and position effects were family-specific. Most of the variance of floral traits was among individuals rather than among flowers within individuals or among families. Significant phenotypic correlations between traits were not affected by position, indicating trait integration under shared developmental regulation. In contrast, positive family-mean correlations in floral traits declined gradually from <b>basal</b> to distal <b>flowers</b> (nine significant correlations among floral traits in <b>basal</b> <b>flowers</b> and only three in distal flowers), showing position-specificity. Therefore, the pattern and magnitude of genetic correlations decreased with flower position. Conclusions This finding on covariation pattern in floral reproductive structures within racemes has not been revealed before, providing insights into temporal variation and position effects in floral traits within plants and the potential advantages of modularity in hermaphrodites. </p...|$|R
40|$|Morphogenesis {{in plants}} is usually reconstructed by {{scanning}} electron microscopy and histology of meristematic structures. These techniques are destructive and require many samples to obtain a consecutive series of states. Unfortunately, using this methodology the absolute timing of growth and complete relative initiation of organs remain obscure. To overcome this limitation, an in vivo observational method based on Epi-Illumination Light Microscopy (ELM) was developed and tested with a male inflorescence meristem (floral unit) of the handkerchief tree Davidia involucrata Baill. (Nyssaceae). We asked whether the most <b>basal</b> <b>flowers</b> of this floral unit arise in a basipetal sequence or, alternatively, are delayed in their development. The growing meristem was observed for 30 days, the longest live observation of a meristem achieved to date. The sequence of primordium initiation indicates a later initiation of the most <b>basal</b> <b>flowers</b> and not earlier or simultaneously as SEM images could suggest. D. involucrata exemplarily shows that live-ELM gives new insights into developmental processes of plants. In addition to morphogenetic questions such as the transition from vegetative to reproductive meristems or the absolute timing of ontogenetic processes, this method may also help to quantify cellular growth processes {{in the context of}} molecular physiology and developmental genetics studies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAutonomous {{self-pollination}} {{is surprisingly}} common among orchids and {{is thought to}} provide reproductive assurance when pollinators are scarce. During investigations of the reproductive biology of the orchid genus Eulophia, consistently high rates of capsule set were observed in Eulophia clavicornis var. clavicornis, E. c. var. inaequalis, E. c. var. nutans and E. tenella. A breeding system experiment showed that E. c. var. nutans is capable of autonomous self-pollination. Emasculated flowers of this taxon did not set fruit, suggesting that agamospermy is unlikely. The likely mechanism of autonomous self-pollination in these taxa was identified as the partial or complete absence of rostellum tissue, allowing contact between pollinia and stigmatic fluid, and thus for pollen tubes to grow from in situ pollinia to the ovules. In some individuals, <b>basal</b> <b>flowers</b> on an inflorescence possess intact rostellae and functional pollinaria, whereas distal flowers lack pollinia. Neither of these two flower classes set capsules. A few individuals of the otherwise outcrossing E. zeyheriana, which normally have well-developed rostellae, show evidence of autonomous self-pollination resulting from interrupted rostellae in these plants. Other outcrossing Eulophia species (E. speciosa and E. streptopetala) sometimes show high levels of fruit set, seemingly without insect visitation. However, investigations showed that these are pseudo-fruits lacking seeds and {{are a result of}} insect parasitism. Therefore, high levels of fruit set alone should not be used to infer autonomous self-pollination in orchids...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Normally, {{it is not}} {{recommended}} the conditioning of gladiolus stems in water during storage or transport. Hydration of petals may accelerate flower opening, even at a low temperature, which compromises quality at marketing moment. However, for this species, neither the effect of prolonged dry cold storage nor its behavior when transferred to water at room temperature has been evaluated. The present study aimed to evaluate the vase life and the rehydration capacity of gladiolus flowers (Gladiolus grandiflora Hort.) after dry storage at low temperature. Flower stems of cultivars Blue Frost, Gold Field, Traderhorn, and Jester were dry-stored at a temperature of 5 ± 1 ºC and relative humidity of 85 % for 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Control stems remained always in deionized water. After storage, they were returned to the water at room temperature and evaluated for vase life (adopting the discard criterion when 50 % of the <b>basal</b> <b>flowers</b> displayed loss of color and wilting), fresh weight change (%), water uptake rate and transpiration rate, as well as relative water content of the petals (%). In dry cold storage conditions, for up to 36 h, the vase life was not affected although incomplete rehydration of the flowers.

40|$|Premise of the study: The showiness of floral {{displays}} {{is usually}} explained as an adaptation to attract pollinators. However, selection for less attractive displays imposed by non-pollinating agents, particularly herbivores, may balance pollinator-driven selection for highly visible inflorescences. We investigated whether inflorescence architecture, particularly the unusual groundlevel flowering {{associated with a}} specialized bird perch in Babiana ringens may have originated, in part, as an adaptive response to mammalian herbivory. Methods: We measured levels of herbivory by antelope in populations of B. hirsuta, the putative sister species of B. ringens, which possesses the likely ancestral form of inflorescence architecture. To test for position-dependent effects of herbivory on flowers, we compared the herbivory rates and seed production of manipulated inflorescences in a field experiment. We predicted that flowers {{at the base of}} inflorescences would suffer less herbivory than those in apical positions. Results: We found herbivore damage to flowers in 50 % of naturally occurring B. hirsuta plants. Manipulated inflorescences with only <b>basal</b> <b>flowers,</b> and consequently similar inflorescence architecture to B. ringens, experienced significantly lower herbivory and higher seed set than inflorescences manipulated to have only apical flowers. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that position-dependent herbivory on inflorescences could {{have played a role in}} the evolution of inflorescence design. More specifically, position-dependent herbivory may have selected for the loss of apical flowers. Position-dependent herbivory may have contributed toward the evolution of a naked inflorescence axis, a structure that characterizes B. ringens and functions as a bird perch facilitating cross-pollination by sunbirds. © 2012 Botanical Society of America...|$|R

Overall, we addressed flowering pattern and pollination modes, flowering process, floral traits, pollinators, and fruiting characteristics of L. otolepsis in Junggar Basin region. We employed scanning electron microscopy to examine the morphology of pistil stigmas and pollen grains. The flowering period of L. otolepis was from early June to mid-July, with extended flowering due to unsynchronized flowering phenology among individuals in the same population. During a given day, it showed a concentrated flowering and pollen release, with anthesis lasting for about 6 – 8 h. Petals unfolded at about 8 : 00 and reached the peak of flowering at about 9 : 00, with no more flowers opening after 11 : 00. One flower produced 752 pollen grains {{with a small amount}} of nectar. The pollen exine ornamentation was reticulate. Insects, including bees and hoverflies, were primary pollinators. Highest visiting frequencies occurred between 9 : 00 and 14 : 00.
