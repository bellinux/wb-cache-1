50|$|On June 18, 1976, {{the swing}} {{span of the}} Third Street Bridge {{collapsed}} as it was being opened, forcing the <b>bridge</b> out <b>of</b> <b>service</b> permanently.

In order to receive federal funding, the new bridge was required to have four lanes and a four-lane bridge at the same site would have necessitated the demolition of some historic buildings. As a result, the Liberty Bridge was built just north <b>of</b> the old <b>bridge</b> site, connecting Woodside Avenue and Vermont Street.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the use of field {{research}} in multidisciplinary design processes when designing the ship's <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> offshore <b>service</b> vessels. From carrying out ten field studies at sea over a three year period we have gained considerable insight into the role which field research may play in design projects for the offshore ship industry. We have found that allowing the designers to experience the onboard environment first hand is vital when designing for such a complex domain. Building on the experience we have gained, we have developed a model for design-driven field research relevant {{for these kinds of}} design projects. Our model encourages designers to engage in design reflection while in the field. This we believe is particularly important when designing for use situations unfamiliar to most designers, like a ship's bridge...|$|R

Strengthening safety {{monitoring}} <b>of</b> <b>bridges</b> during <b>service</b> {{time and}} improving the capability of emergency support have become the priority {{of the development of}} China’s present transportation system. Strain sensors play a great role in bridge detection and health monitoring system. In order to overcome disadvantages of traditional resistance strain sensors, such as big temperature drift, short life and inadaptability in the environment of low temperature and humidity, new arch strain sensors have been developed. This paper mainly discusses the structural and material characteristics of this sensor, as well as the performance test analysis of this strain sensor...|$|R

40|$|Innovative {{solutions}} for rapid and intelligent survey and assessment methods are required in maintenance, repair, retrofit and rebuild of enormous numbers <b>of</b> <b>bridges</b> in <b>service</b> throughout the world. Motivated by this need, a next-generation integrated bridge inspection system named SeeBridge is proposed. To frame the system, an Information Delivery Manual (IDM) was compiled {{to specify the}} technical components, activities and information exchanges in the SeeBridge process. The IDM supports development of the system by rigorously defining the information and data repositories that structure bridge engineers’ knowledge. The SeeBridge process is mapped, parts of the data repositories are presented and the future use of the IDM is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Technologies {{that allow}} the {{behavior}} <b>of</b> <b>bridges</b> and structures to be monitored in a non-contact manner are useful in their maintenance. The full-field optical measurement method is one of such technologies and holds great promiseS for the future. The frequency-shifted feedback laser (FSF Laser) optical coordinates measurement system (FSF-OCMS), which allows non-contact measurement of objects, has the feature that its measurement accuracy is distance-independent and also allows dynamic measurement. The FSF-OCMS also has a driving mechanism, which allows full-field measurement by providing laser irradiation direction control. The performance of the FSF Laser has already been verified in short-distance measurement operations. To evaluate {{the applicability of the}} FSF-OCMS to the monitoring <b>of</b> <b>bridges</b> and structures, the authors carried out field measurement experiments to verify the device’s performance with regard to displacement measurements from long distance and measured the natural frequencies and deflections <b>of</b> <b>bridges</b> in <b>service.</b> It is expected that the establishment of this technology will bring new possibilities for the monitoring of civil engineering structures...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to answer}} {{questions}} regarding material and fatigue properties <b>of</b> <b>bridges</b> built {{between the end of}} the 19 th century to 1940 's. Regarding material properties the study involves the creation of a data base consisting of material properties <b>of</b> <b>bridges.</b> The establishment <b>of</b> a data base was done by retrieval of test certificates from material investigations conducted on existing bridges. The bridges in question were road and railway bridges produced before 1940 's. The aim of the investigation was to determine the material properties <b>of</b> <b>bridges</b> in the specified interval and compare these with properties in evaluation codes. From the evaluation of the data base it became apparent that the yield strength <b>of</b> the existing <b>bridges</b> was higher than specified in the evaluations codes of Sweden and Denmark. Also a big divergence regarding the toughness properties were established for the investigated bridges. Regarding fatigue endurance, a literature survey of fatigue tests performed on riveted structures were conducted. The survey concerned both full scale structures retrieved from <b>bridges</b> taken out <b>of</b> <b>service</b> and small scale tests. The objective was to investigate the fatigue resistance of riveted structures. Factors as hole preparation, corrosion, clamping force and influence from materials properties on the fatigue performance was also inquired. In the evaluation of the fatigue tests it was concluded that fatigue endurance of riveted assembled girders was best described by the detail category C= 63. Godkänd; 2006; 20070109 (haneit...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we focused}} mainly on {{establishing}} a new sensitive method to identify location <b>of</b> damages in <b>Service</b> <b>Bridge.</b> The improved method of combination of Autoregressive models (AR) and autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) {{was applied to}} identify the damage in Service Bridge.

Finally，the improved AR-ARX model was used to identify location of damage in a two-span steel beam.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the state, the market and professions has been in focus of sociological theories on professions. This study explores how Lithuanian physicians perceive these three sectors, called logics in sociological theories, to influence their work in a health care context which has experienced a rapid change. The {{results show that the}} physicians perceived the state regulated health care system as a limitation to their professional identity and practice. Market elements of care did not seem to work and instead two other mechanisms <b>bridged</b> the provision <b>of</b> <b>services</b> between the client and the physician: peer referrals and gift-giving. The peer referral system enabled physicians to directly refer patients to a professional colleague outside the formal referral system and thereby to improve access to health services that the state directed system could not handle efficiently. Gift-giving and gratitude payments provided some consumer influence in the delivery <b>of</b> health <b>services</b> in a failing market system. The conclusion is that in a post-socialist health care system physicians are often operating in a system guided by four logics: the state, the market, professional culture, and the informal economy of peer referrals, gift giving, and extra payments...|$|R
