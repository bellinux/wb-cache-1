40|$|Since the United Sate Federal Communication Commission (FCC) {{released}} the first Ultra Wide-band (UWB) report on February 14, 2002, {{the interest in}} UWB technology has increased substantially in both academia and industry. Interest is to simulate by the expectation that UWB can solve the shortage of the available frequency recourses. The European Electronics Communications Committee (ECC) has approved the use of UWB devices {{in the range from}} 6 - 8. 5 GHz, subjected to the technical limits embossed by FCC in the US. Therefore one of the main goals is to find an optimal planar-antenna working in the European (UWB) spectrum 6 - 8. 5 GHz, with a bandwidth of 2. 5 GHz. The different ntypes of antennas investigated are the dipole antenna, the square antenna (basic square antenna, square antenna with <b>bevel,</b> <b>square</b> with off set) and the circular disc antenna, designed and simulated in Advance Design System (ADS). Planar antennas implemented in this project have a multi layer PCB structure which includes a flexible foil. The design process is mainly carried out in two steps. In the first step dimensions of antennas were calculated, then in the second step dimensions were tuned until the simulation result fulfilled the demands of the design specification. The characteristic input impedance, bandwidth, gain, directivity and electromagnetic radiation pattern are compared among different types of planar antennas investigated. In this report the bandwidth the focus because it the major concern of the project. The Balun is used to adapt the signal between the antenna and the device (transmitter and receiver). When the Balun simulated together with a planar antenna small change in the bandwidth is observed. It found that there are four types of planar antennas (basic square antennas, square antenna with <b>bevel,</b> <b>square</b> antenna with offset and circular disc antenna) can be used in the Ultra Wideband spectrum 6 - 8. 5 GHz...|$|E
50|$|After {{looking at}} a range of tools from {{prehistory}} to the Romans, the book examines in detail more recent hand tools by function: from saws to drills and braces; from rules and gauges to <b>bevels,</b> <b>squares</b> and levels. Much of the book, however, is devoted to an extensive selection of wooden and metal planes and highlights their manifold functions. These planes are arranged within chapters on continental European, British and American models, {{with some of the}} great British makers from the eighteenth to the early twentieth century discussed in depth. A short chapter focuses on spurious and altered items, drawing the reader's attention to some of the pitfalls of collecting vintage tools.|$|R

50|$|Dunhill Light {{cigarettes}} are packaged {{in a predominantly}} white packet, with a <b>bevelled</b> edged <b>square</b> of red in the centre. Dunhill has decided to phase out this pack and have introduced marketing information that the blue box described below is the same cigarette although carbon monoxide levels and nicotine levels are altered.|$|R

Radiation patterns are stable and bidirectional with 6. 5989 DB gain throughout the band. Radiation efficiency is 97. 12 %. Extensive simulation results using HFSS simulation software...|$|R
50|$|The most simple form of {{set square}} is a {{triangular}} piece of transparent plastic (or formerly of polished wood) with the centre removed. More commonly the set square bears the markings of a ruler {{and a half}} circle protractor. The outer edges are typically <b>bevelled.</b> These set <b>squares</b> come in two usual forms, both right triangles: one with 90-45-45 degree angles, the other with 30-60-90 degree angles. Combining the two forms by placing the hypotenuses together will also yield 15° and 75° angles. They are often purchased in packs with protractors and compasses.|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a printed slot antenna in the ultrawideband is presented in this article. The proposed design consists of an octagonal-shaped shaped slot fed by a <b>bevelled</b> and <b>square</b> patch for covering the UWB band (3. 1 – 10. 6 10. 6 GHz). The impedance bandwidth (VSWR < 2) of the antenna is from 3 to 11 GHz. Radiation patterns are stable and bidirectional with appreciable gain throughout the band. Performance of the antenna is also analyzed in the time domain, which reveals good pulse handling capabilities [...] es [...] Due to its advantages such as lowcost, small size low weight and capability to integrate with Microwave integrated circuits, the slot antenna {{is a very good}} candidate for integrations in applications such as wireless communication systems, mobile phones ph and laptops. Due to development of communication engineering with integration technology demand size reduction of low frequency antennas as an important design perspective.

5000|$|By 1978 {{the bike}} looked identical, but several {{significant}} improvements {{had made their}} way into the motor making them more reliable and solving problems with engine cranks breaking. The electronics also improved as well as some minor timing tweaks making the bike run more efficiently. Most notable was a majorly redesigned gear shifter that made the bike a lot easier for owners to live with the bike. Most 1978 900 Super Sports also came with a dual seat and lockable tool box. The solo seat was available as an option. The 1978 model bike is considered to be the finest iteration of the <b>bevel</b> drive <b>square</b> case Super Sports. The 1978 900 and 1979 750s were the last to retain close links with the Imola racers and the last to come with the [...] "old fashioned" [...] spoke wheels. it was also in 1978 that the Isle of Man TT Formula 1 race was won by a 900 Super Sport, ridden by former World Champion Mike Hailwood in a popular comeback race.|$|R
50|$|The nave {{is covered}} with a gable roof, over the presbytery with a hipped roof, and over the facade shield with a keel. The {{rectangular}} nave is vaulted with two almost square fields of the cross vault with an inter-vault rib. The centre console in the north wall is replaced with a semi-cylindrical console under which there is a flat pilaster. The western field in the width of the choir organ is bent with a pointed vault with a belt. On the vault there is coat of arms with the Czech lion. The north wall of the main nave with a triumphal arch at high pointed arch opens into the adjoining chapel of St. Eligius. Two semicircular heads of the former Romanesque vault were uncovered by Hilbert {{on the wall of the}} main nave; in the eastern head is a rectangular hole. The original saddle portal with the intersection leads from the north side of the organ-loft. The south wall of the main nave is broken into the side nave with two semicircular arcades on massive <b>square</b> <b>bevelled</b> block-style pillars. The organ-loft (choir) is vaulted with one field of cross-comb vaults. The railing is fully walled, strengthened with pentagonal pillars. Under the organ-loft there was discovered the lower choir. The Romanesque floor level runs here about 2 feet below.|$|R
