Hullett took an overdose of barbiturates on 19 July 1956 but Adams only gave her a single 10cc dose of <b>bemegride</b> three days later on the 22nd, despite having acquired 100cc for her treatment. Hullett died the next day on 23 July 1956. Adams was charged but never tried for her murder.|$|E
50|$|Convulsant drugs (the {{functional}} opposites of anticonvulsants) {{will always}} induce seizures at sufficient doses. Examples of such agents, {{some of which}} are used or have been used clinically for various purposes, and others of which are naturally occurring toxins, include strychnine, <b>bemegride,</b> flumazenil, cyclothiazide, flurothyl, pentylenetetrazol, bicuculline, cicutoxin, and picrotoxin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bemegride</b> (trademarked as Megimide) is {{a central}} nervous system {{stimulant}} and antidote for barbiturate poisoning as its chemoreceptor agonism increases mean tidal volume, thereby increasing respiration and the concentration of O2 in blood {{although it may be}} theoretically used as a supportive measure in treating any depressant overdose. The drug was first synthesized in 1911.|$|E
50|$|After their {{introduction}} in {{the early}} 20th century, analeptics were used to study the new life-threatening problem of barbiturate overdose. Prior to the 1930s naturally occurring stimulants such as camphor and caffeine were utilized {{in the treatment of}} barbiturate overdose. Between 1930 and 1960 synthetic analeptics such as nikethamide, pentylenetetrazol, <b>bemegride,</b> amphetamine, and methylphenidate replaced the naturally occurring compounds in treating barbiturate overdose. Recently, analeptics have been turned to the treatment of ADHD due to more efficient ways to treat barbiturate overdoses.|$|E
50|$|Amiphenazole (Daptazile) is a {{respiratory}} stimulant traditionally used as {{an antidote}} for barbiturate or opiate overdose, usually in combination with <b>bemegride,</b> as well as poisoning from other sedative drugs and treatment of respiratory failure from other causes. It was considered particularly useful as it could counteract the sedation and respiratory depression produced by morphine but with less effect on analgesia. It is still rarely used in medicine in some countries, although it has largely been replaced by more effective respiratory stimulants such as doxapram and specific opioid antagonists such as naloxone.|$|E
50|$|Some convulsants such as {{pentetrazol}} and flurothyl {{were previously}} used in shock therapy in psychiatric medicine, {{as an alternative}} to electroconvulsive therapy. Others such as strychnine and tetramethylenedisulfotetramine are used as poisons for exterminating pests. <b>Bemegride</b> and flumazenil are used to treat drug overdoses (of barbiturates and benzodiazepines respectively), but may cause convulsions if the dose is too high. Convulsants are also widely used in scientific research, for instance in the testing of new anticonvulsant drugs. Convulsions are induced in captive animals, then high doses of anticonvulsant drugs are administered.|$|E
50|$|Carisoprodol is not {{detected}} on all toxicology tests {{which may}} delay diagnosis of overdose. Overdose symptoms {{in combination with}} opiates are similar but are distinguished by the presentation of normal or pinpoint pupils, which are generally unresponsive to light. Carisoprodol (as with its metabolite meprobamate) is particularly dangerous in combination with alcohol. Flumazenil (the benzodiazepine antidote) is not effective {{in the management of}} carisoprodol overdose as carisoprodol acts at the barbiturate binding site. Treatment mirrors that of barbiturate overdoses and is generally supportive, including the administration of mechanical respiration and pressors as implicated (and in rare cases, <b>bemegride).</b> Total amnesia of the experience is not uncommon following recovery.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} and excretion of <b>bemegride</b> labelled at the α carbon atoms with 14 C were studied in mice, rats, and guinea-pigs. These studies were supplemented by others made by colorimetric and absorptiometric methods on unlabelled <b>bemegride</b> {{in the body}} fluids of rabbits and dogs. <b>Bemegride</b> passed rapidly from plasma to all tissues, including brain, muscle, and fat. In addition it passed readily into the cerebrospinal fluid and the aqueous humour and to the foetus. It persisted in the tissues for longer than 24 hr., to some extent preferentially in the central nervous system. Approximately two-thirds of the dose was excreted in the bile, faeces, and urine within 24 hr. The glutarimide ring of <b>bemegride</b> was not completely degraded biologically...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of audiogenic seizures in mice {{has been used}} as the basis of a method for measuring the antagonism between sodium thiopentone and <b>bemegride</b> or leptazol. Thiopentone in doses of 8 and 16 mg. /kg. protected all the mice against the {{occurrence of}} audiogenic seizures. <b>Bemegride</b> and leptazol were administered in doses having molecular concentrations which bore a simple relationship to the doses of thiopentone. <b>Bemegride</b> was four times as powerful as leptazol in antagonizing the protective effect of thiopentone, and comparison of their regression lines showed that both analeptics acted in the same way. The antagonistic effect of <b>bemegride</b> occurred with doses less than its normal convulsant dose, but the doses of leptazol needed to antagonize thiopentone were within the convulsant range, and it increased the severity of any audiogenic seizures...|$|E
40|$|Observations on induction, {{duration}} and recovery after thiopentone, as modified by glucose, physostigmine and <b>bemegride,</b> {{were made on}} twelve dogs, every dog acting as bis own control. Glucose, together with thiopentone, caused no significant change in induction time, while the duration of anaesthesia and recovery period was prolonged. Physostigmine and <b>bemegride</b> delayed the onset of anaesthesia after thiopentone and shortened the {{duration and}} recovery timings, and they antagonized the glucose poten-tiation of thiopentone anaesthesia. The action of these antagonisms has been discussed as a non-specific one. It is concluded that the duration of surgical anaesthesia with thiopentone can be prolonged by simultaneous intravenous administration of glucose, and this prolongation can be cut short at will by administration of drugs like physc-stigmine and <b>bemegride.</b> Thiopentone {{is one of the}} most commonly used anaesthetic agents in surgical practice. The drug, however, is mainly used for induction purposes, since prolonged continuous administration of this single anaesthetic agent is neither advocated nor advisable for long surgical operations because of the considerable danger of respiratory depres-sion and fall in blood pressure. Even supplemen-tation by pethidine leads to more respiratory depression. Thus, it is felt that drugs should always be available which are able to minimize the dangers and side effects of thiopentone. Further, if by some means the dose of thiopen-tone could be reduced without any decrease in its efficiency, the incidence of the ill effects of thiopentone would be greatly diminished. Barbiturate poisoning, especially with pento-barbitone has been successfully treated with beme-gride. The effects of the latter drug have not been completely studied in relation to thiopentone, which is an ultra-short-acting barbiturate, while pentobarbitone belongs to an intermediate group. <b>Bemegride</b> was, therefore, included in this study to observe its effects on the induction, duration and recovery timings of thiopentone anaesthesia...|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{through the}} cat {{superior}} cervical ganglion was studied by recording {{the response of}} the nictitating membrane to both pre- and postganglionic cervical sympathetic nerve stimulation. The intra-arterial injection of central depressant drugs to the ganglion through the lingual artery depressed transmission through the ganglion. The central depressant drugs tested were (in decreasing order of activity) : amylobarbitone, pentobarbitone, carbromal, benactyzine, mephobarbitone, hydroxyzine, phenobarbitone, azacyclonol, methylpentynol carbamate, paraldehyde, phenytoin, mephenesin, chlorbutol, troxidone, methylpentynol and barbitone. All were weaker ganglion-blocking agents than tetraethylammonium. The intra-arterial injection of the central stimulant drugs leptazol, <b>bemegride,</b> amiphenazole and 5 -(1, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -enyl) - 5 -ethylbarbituric acid (McN 481) also depressed ganglionic transmission. Leptazol or <b>bemegride</b> did not antagonize the ganglion-blocking action of amylobarbitone or troxidone. The intra-arterial injection of pecazine and perphenazine, and the intravenous injection of barbitone, benactyzine, azacyclonol, hydroxyzine, mephenesin, methylpentynol and paraldehyde impaired {{the response of the}} nictitating membrane to both post- and preganglionic stimulation. The implications of these observations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} CNS stimulants {{to block the}} discriminative effects of {{pentobarbital}} was studied in pigeons trained to discriminate IM pentobarbital (5 mg/kg) from saline. Pentobarbital, when administered alone, consistently produced greater than 90 % pentobarbital-appropriate responding. The concomitant administration of pentobarbital and increasing doses of <b>bemegride</b> or pentylenetetrazol resulted in a dose-related decrease in pentobarbital-appropriate responses. In contrast, picrotoxin, another CNS stimulant, {{had little or no}} effect on pentobarbital-appropriate responding produced by pentobarbital...|$|E
40|$|Three pigeons {{were trained}} to {{discriminate}} a 5. 0 mg/kg dose of pentobarbital from saline under a two-key concurrent schedule with responding on the key associated with the presession injection, under both stimulus conditions, producing {{four times as many}} reinforcers as responding on the other key. This concurrent schedule resulted in approximately 70 % responding to the higher reinforcement key under the pentobarbital stimulus and approximately 30 % responding to that key under the saline stimulus. During testing, then, the pigeons were able to dose-dependently emit higher (> 70 %) or lower (< 30 %) values than were established under the control conditions. Dose-response curves were determined for pentobarbital (twice), methamphetamine, phencyclidine, chlordiazepoxide, and the combination of pentobarbital and the barbiturate antagonist <b>bemegride.</b> The results obtained with pentobarbital and chlordiazepoxide showed that, as the dose increased, pentobarbital-appropriate responding also increased. Methamphetamine produced relatively flat dose [...] response curves, whereas phencyclidine administration produced inconsistent effects on responding. The combination of the training dose of pentobarbital with increasing doses of <b>bemegride</b> produced a decrease in pentobarbital-appropriate responding. The results also showed that the dose-response curves for pentobarbital and chlordiazepoxide, instead of being all or none, were graded functions of the drug dose...|$|E
40|$|A 49 -year-old man had {{a sudden}} onset of {{generalized}} convulsion. No finding was gained through neurological testing. Skull X-ray film and plain CT-scan revealed a calcified mass in the right frontal lobe. <b>Bemegride</b> activated EEG showed focal abnormal wave discharge in the right frontal lead.

A 42 -year-old woman suffered from temporal epilepsy for several years. Every effort had been made to cope with the seizures but in vain. Incidentally a calcified mass was disclosed in the right temporal lobe through CT-scan. The patient then underwent a surgical operation. Histopathological examination was carried out and it was diagnosed as cavernous hemangioma. The paper presents 2 surgical cases where the onset of convulsive attack was attributable to brain stone.

40|$|Pigeons {{were trained}} to {{discriminate}} the IM injection of pentobarbital (5 or 10 mg/kg) from saline in a task in which 20 consecutive pecks on one of two response keys produced access to mixed grain. Pentobarbital (1. 0 – 17. 8 mg/kg) produced a dose-related increase {{in the percentage of}} the total session responses that occurred on the pentobarbital-appropriate key. The concomitant administration of <b>bemegride</b> (5. 6 – 17. 8 mg/kg) antagonized the discriminative control of behavior exerted by the training dose of pentobarbital. Benzodiazepines, diazepam (1. 0 mg/kg) and clobazam (3. 2 mg/kg), and barbiturates, methohexital (10 mg/kg), phenobarbital (56 mg/kg), and barbital (56 mg/kg), produced responding on the pentobarbital-appropriate key similar to that produced by pentobarbital. In contrast, narcotics such as morphine, ethylketazocine, cyclazocine, and SKF- 10, 047, at doses up to and including those that markedly suppressed response rates, produced responding predominantly on the saline-appropriate key. Similarly, the anticonvulsants, valproate, phenytoin, and ethosuximide occasioned only saline-appropriate behavior, indicating that not all anticonvulsants share discriminative stimulus effects with pentobarbital. Muscimol, a direct GABA agonist, and baclofen, a structural analogue of GABA, also failed to produce pentobarbital-appropriate responding. Ketamine, dextrorphan, and ethanol (0. 3 – 3. 2 g/kg, orally) produced intermediate levels of pentobarbital-appropriate responding, suggesting that the discriminative effects of these drugs may be somewhat like those of pentobarbital...|$|E
40|$|I) On an {{identified}} giant neurone of {{the right}} parietal ganglion in a snail's subesophageal ganglion-complex, the synaptic contribution {{to the production of}} the plateau formation of biopotential or grouped spike discharges of the soma has been studied {{in the presence of a}} convulsant. 2) The orthodromic stimulation of a peripheral nerve (the intestinal nerve) can elicit the plateau formation of biopotential, instead of normal spike discharges, in the identified neurone treated with a convulsant. 3) With the application of a convulsant, for example <b>bemegride</b> which was in a concentration less than that necessary to produce the plateau formation, an EPSP accompanied a spike with a constant delay. This EPSP is a product of a proprioceptive reflex arc consisting of two excitatory synapses with a certain subordinate neurone. 4) Later, in the presence of a convulsant, spontaneously conveyed multiple EPSP's were observed on the biopotential of the identified neurone. These multiple EPSP's produced grouped spike discharges or the plateau formation of biopotential of the neurone. 5) The multiple EPSP's may be produced by the grouped spike discharges of the subordinate neurone, the membrane property of which would be changed by a convulsant. It is presumed that the grouped spike discharges or the plateau formation of biopotential often occurs synchron. ously in many neighboring neurones by means of synaptic triggering in the presence of a convulsant. </p...|$|E
40|$|I {{present a}} new, simple {{colorimetric}} method for detect-ing and estimating barbiturates in urine. After the barbi-turates are extracted with ether, an aliquot of the washed ether phase {{is added to}} the color reagent (a bi-valent mercury/dithizone chelate in chloroform). On ad-dition of diluted pyridine and shaking, a pinkish-violet color appears if a barbiturate is present. The overall sensitivity of the above method was evaluated by probit analysis in the case of sodium phenobarbital. The con-centration of sodium phenobarbital in urine detectable at least 99 % of the time was 6. 72 mg/liter, with 95 % confidence limits of 5. 37 to 10. 36 mg/liter. Sodium phe-nobarbital, 10 mg/liter, can be detected in the presence of phenytoin (50 mg/liter), glutethimide (100 mg/liter), or <b>bemegride</b> (100 mg/liter). The whole procedure requires < 10 mm. An excretion study illustrates application of the procedure. AddItIonal Keyphrases: toxicology #{ 149 }screening for drug abuse Detection of barbiturates in biological material usually causes serious difficulties, because we lack a sufficiently sensitive and selective method that does not put great demands on apparatus and skill of the laboratory worker. Such a method would serve for screening samples before precise indentification by gas chromatography or mass spectrophotometry, and it might suffice if such apparatus is not available. The basis of the present method was the previous work on formation of barbiturate complexes with bi-valent mercury and diphenylthiocarbazone (dithi-zone) (1 - 10) ...|$|E
40|$|Carisoprodol is a {{frequently}} prescribed muscle relaxant. In recent years, {{this drug}} has been increasingly abused. The effects of carisoprodol {{have been attributed}} to its metabolite, meprobamate, a controlled substance that produces sedation via GABAA receptors (GABAARs). Given the structural similarities between carisoprodol and meprobamate, we used electrophysiological and behavioral approaches to investigate whether carisoprodol directly affects GABAAR function. In whole-cell patch-clamp studies, carisoprodol allosterically modulated and directly activated human α 1 β 2 γ 2 GABAAR function in a barbiturate-like manner. At millimolar concentrations, inhibitory effects were apparent. Similar allosteric effects were not observed for homomeric ρ 1 GABA or glycine α 1 receptors. In the absence of GABA, carisoprodol produced picrotoxin-sensitive, inward currents that were significantly larger than those produced by meprobamate, suggesting carisoprodol may directly produce GABAergic effects in vivo. When administered to mice via intraperitoneal or oral routes, carisoprodol elicited locomotor depression within 8 to 12 min after injection. Intraperitoneal administration of meprobamate depressed locomotor activity in the same time frame. In drug discrimination studies with carisoprodol-trained rats, the GABAergic ligands pentobarbital, chlordiazepoxide, and meprobamate each substituted for carisoprodol in a dose-dependent manner. In accordance with findings in vitro, the discriminative stimulus effects of carisoprodol were antagonized by a barbiturate antagonist, <b>bemegride,</b> but not by the benzodiazepine site antagonist, flumazenil. The results of our studies in vivo and in vitro collectively suggest the barbiturate-like effects of carisoprodol may not be due solely to its metabolite, meprobamate. Furthermore, the functional traits we have identified probably contribute to the abuse potential of carisoprodol...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{effects were}} studied on the {{cerebral}} circulation {{by measuring the}} sagittal sinus outflow in the anaesthetized dog following the method of Michenfelder and by monitoring cerebral oxygen consumption. Systemic aortic pressure, heart rate and spinal fluid pressure were also studied. Since dilatation of cerebral vessels was observed in nearly all the preparations after inhalation of CO 2, {{it was thought that}} gross extracerebral contamination was virtually eliminated in this preparation. A close correlation was observed between the oxygen consumption of the brain as a whole and the sagittal sinus outflow (r = 0. 93, P less than 0. 001); therefore it became feasible to differentiate the direct effects of drugs on cerebral blood vessels from indirect ones attributable to changes in the cerebral oxidative metabolism. Sodium pentobarbitone (5 mg kg- 1, i. v.), reduced the cerebral venous outflow and caused a decrease in the oxygen consumption. Pentylenetetrazol (30 mg kg- 1 i. v.) and <b>bemegride</b> (5 mg kg- 1 i. v.) produced an increase in the blood flow and a corresponding increase in the cerebral oxygen consumption. Thus, it was concluded these substances had no direct effects on the cerebral blood vessels. Acetazolamide (10 mg kg- 1, i. v.), a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, produced a marked and sustained vasodilatation after a latent period of 0. 5 - 1 min. There was no increase in the cerebral oxygen consumption. A similar pattern was seen after CO 2 had been inhaled. Methylergometrine and dihydroergotamine (20 micrograms kg- 1 i. v.) induced a prolonged vasoconstriction of the cerebral vascular bed without any changes in the oxygen consumption of the brain. Therefore this method can discriminate between indirect or direct effects of drugs on cerebral vascular outflow...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of 6 c/s spike and wave or wave and spike phantom(WSP) was examined by administration of diphenhydramine hydrochloride(DPHm). And {{the nature of}} 6 c/s spike and wave or WSP was studied. 1. There were 787 subjects, {{all of whom were}} healthy young males {{with a mean age of}} 24. 4 years. The {{incidence of}} WSP in these subjects before administration of DPHm was 1. 0 %. Of these, 470 subjects were given DPHm. The incidence of WSP after DPHm administration was 16. 4 %. WSP incidence after DPHm administration was much higher than that of routine EEG recordings. 2. Dosage of DPHm were 0. 5 mg/kg(N= 52), 1. 0 mg/kg(N= 72), 1. 5 mg/kg(N= 189), 2. 0 mg/kg(N= 157). The incidence of WSP did not vary with the dosage. 3. Comparisons were made between the WSP positive and negative subjects in past histories, Cornell Medical Index results and in the basic activity of each EEG recordings. No significant differences were observed in these parameters. 4. Ninety-five subjects were injected first with DPHm 1. 5 mg/kg. <b>Bemegride</b> (Bg) was administered to the subjects showing WSP after DPHm injection. One hundred nine-teen other subjects were injected first with Bg 50 mg. Subjects showing paroxysmal discharges with spike components after Bg were given DPHm 1. 5 mg/kg. The incidence after Bg and the incidence after DPHm were closely resembled each other. 5. These wave forms provoked by both DPHm and Bg administration were compared in the same individual. DPHm induced almost exclusively WSP form. Bg mainly showed atypical spike and wave form. Thus the author speculated that the WSP and the atypical spike and wave are the continuum. 6. Carefull attention should be given to the clinical diagnosis in cases where WSP has been demonstrated only by DPHm. 7. WSP after DPHm administration should be considered as a subclinical electrical manifestation. The incidence was very different according to age. 8. This study showed the possibility of DPHm having the property of the active activator...|$|E
40|$|Investigation of the {{biological}} basis of anxiety is hampered {{by the lack of}} an appropriate animal model for research purposes. There are no known drugs that cause anxiety in laboratory animals. Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) produces intense anxiety in human volunteers (Rodin, 1958; Rodin and Calhoun, 1970). Therefore, it was the major objective of this dissertation to test the hypothesis that the discriminative stimulus produced by PTZ in the rat was related to its anxiogenic action in man. It was also an objective to suggest the neurochemical basis for the discriminative stimulus property of PTZ through appropriate drug interactions. In an operant procedure of lever pressing on a FR 10 schedule of food reinforcement, male hooded rats were trained to respond with a lever on one side of a food cup 15 min following a 20 mg/kg PTZ injection and to respond with a lever on the alternate side 15 min following a 1 ml/kg saline injection. All of the rats learned this discrimination reliably in a mean of 30 training sessions. The discriminative stimulus produced by PTZ was dose- and time-dependent. The anxiogenic stimulants cocaine, R 05 - 3663 and strychnine generalized to the PTZ discriminative stimulus whereas yohimbine partially generalized. The discriminative stimulus produced by cocaine, R 05 - 3663 and yohimbine was antagonized by the anxiolytic drug, diazepam. The discriminative stimulus produced by cocaine was not antagonized by haloperidol. The non-anxiogenic psychomotor stimulants d-amphetamine, methylphenidate or caffeine did not generalize to the PTZ discriminative stimulus. <b>Bemegride</b> was the only convulsant drug tested that generalized to the PTZ discriminative stimulus. Picrotoxin and 3 -mercaptopropionic partially, but not significantly, generalized to the PTZ discriminative stimulus but bicuculline, garnma-hydroxybutyrate or nicotine did not generalize. The PTZ discriminative stimulus was dose-dependently antagonized by benzodiazepine-type, barbiturate-type, propanediol carbamate-type anxiolytics as well as valproic acid. Tolerance did not develop to antagonism of the PTZ of discriminative stimulus by diazepam or chlordiazepoxide. The discriminative stimulus produced by PTZ was not antagonized by an anticonvulsant or other central nervous system depressants that are not anxiolytics. There was a significant correlation between the potency of drugs effective in antagonizing the PTZ discriminative stimulus and their effective doses in a conflict test of anxiety as well as their clinically effective doses. The GABA antagonist ROS- 3663 generalized to the PTZ discriminative stimulus whereas picrotoxin and 3 -mercaptopropionic acid partially generalized. The PTZ discriminative stimulus was antagonized by the GABA mimetic, valproic acid. The glycine antagonist, strychnine, generalized to the PTZ discriminative stimulus. Neither acetylcholine nor serotonin agonists or antagonists generalized to or antagonized the PTZ discriminative stimulus. The catecholamine agonist, cocaine, generalized to the PTZ discriminative stimulus whereas yohimbine and apomorphine partially generalized. However, neither a-amphetamine nor methylphenidate generalized to the PTZ discriminative stimulus and catecholamine receptor antagonists did not antagonize the PTZ discriminative stimulus. Generalization to the PTZ discriminative stimulus by anxiogenic drugs and lack of generalization by non-anxiogenic psychomotor stimulants or convulsants as well as antagonism of the PTZ discriminative stimulus by anxiolytics but not non-anxiolytic anticonvulsant or depressants supports the hypothesis that the discriminative stimulus produced by PTZ in the rat is related to its anxiogenic action in man. Generalization to the PTZ discriminative stimulus by GABA antagonists and antagonism by GABA agonists but lack of generalization to or antagonism by drugs affecting other neurotransmitter systems suggests that the PTZ discriminative stimulus might be •mediated through decreased GABA neuronal activity...|$|E
