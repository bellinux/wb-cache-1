50|$|The {{brake system}} for FE {{is similar to}} the rest of the FM/FH family of trucks with EBS however a new {{integrated}} air dryer system called APM or Air Production Management was introduced. APM combines the functions of air dryer, regulator, four-way protection valve, pressure limiting and safety valves, pressure sensors and <b>blocking</b> <b>valve</b> into one unit and is electronically controlled. The main advantages of the system are in reduced numbers of separate components which also reduces risk of air leakage and electrical connectors failures.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{structure}} of a shuttle valve is like a tube with three openings; one on each end, {{and one in the}} middle. A ball or other <b>blocking</b> <b>valve</b> element moves freely within the tube. When pressure from a fluid is exerted through an opening on one end it pushes the ball towards the opposite end. This prevents the fluid from traveling through that opening, but allows it to flow through the middle opening. In this way two different sources can provide pressure without the threat of back flow from one source to the other.|$|E
40|$|The {{drum dryer}} {{is a common}} {{appliance}} for drying clothes in households today. It is constantly developed {{in order to reduce}} its environmental impact and energy consumption. An industrial partner has initiated a research project with the aim to substitute R 134 a with CO 2 as refrigerant. R 134 a has a global warming potential (GWP) 1300 times the GWP of CO 2, thus CO 2 is a much more environmental friendly refrigerant. A drum dryer driven by a heat pump was previously modified to use CO 2 as refrigerant. This system has now been further developed to include a two-stage compressor and a liquid separator at an intermediate pressure. The flash gas is separated on the intermediate pressure stage and injected into the compressor. Theoretically the result should be a higher mass flow on the high-pressure stage and reduced work required for 1 st stage compression. Closing a <b>blocking</b> <b>valve</b> at the intermediate stage can disable the flash gas recycling process. This gives the opportunity to compare the results to the results from a regular cycle. The results from the experiments in this study are compared to results from similar experiments. Results are available from experiments by former students and initial tests by the industrial partner. The industrial partner also provided an ultimate goal of 0. 26 kWh/kgtextiles, which is {{the state of the art}} consumption for R 134 a heat pumps. The two main performance measures are specific energy consumption based on weight of the textile load and specific energy consumption based on weight of the removed water. The best experiment in this study consumed 0. 37 kWh/kgtextiles and 0. 61 kWh/kgremoved water. These results were achieved by disabling the flash gas injection. The corresponding results using flash gas injection were 0. 41 kWh/kgtextiles and 0. 70 kWh/kgremoved water. In the current setup the flash gas injection has not contributed to reduced energy consumption. There has been a challenge to control the flash gas injection while keeping the superheat low out of the evaporator. Suitable modifications have been suggested to overcome this issue. </p...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an extensive simulation study of power {{loss in the}} lubricating gap between cylinder <b>block</b> and <b>valve</b> plate. The simulation model used in this investigation covers fluid structure interaction and micro motion of the cylinder block resulting from oscillating piston forces. The model calculates pressure and velocity fields generated in the lubricating film as well as leakage, and viscous friction. Details of the model are explained. Using the model, power losses in the cylinder <b>block</b> <b>valve</b> plate gap are investigated {{as a function of}} operating condition for three displacement units. It is shown that power losses for low load operating conditions are approximately the same as power loss for high load operating conditions. In order to reduce losses at low loads, a sinusoidal or wavy micro structured surface is applied to the cylinder block surface. The effect of operating parameters that waved surfaces of varying amplitude and frequency have on power loss in the cylinder <b>block</b> <b>valve</b> plate interface when compared to power loss of a standard, ideally smooth sliding surface is studied. As the gap height of the lubricating film represents the most critical parameter relating to pump performance, special attention is given to the relation between gap height, operating parameters, surface design and power loss. It is shown that significant reductions in power loss occur at low pressure operating conditions with the introduction of the waved surface. ...|$|R

ESD valves typically stay in open position for months or years awaiting a command signal to operate. Little attention is paid to these valves outside of scheduled turnarounds.
