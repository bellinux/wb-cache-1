They <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> it, losing the lawyer in the process, but discover a large group of Martians stationed there as they are preparing to take off. Byron creates a diversion by challenging them to a fistfight. While he succeeds in killing the Ambassador, he is outnumbered and overwhelmed, but Tom, Barbara and Cindy escape.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, the Wild set a {{franchise}} record {{with the best}} win record in the first 41 games of the season. Immediately afterward, they went into a skid, losing the next 13 of 14 games, culminating in the firing of head coach Mike Yeo. Under new interim head coach John Torchetti, the team snapped the losing streak but remained streaky {{throughout the rest of}} the season, managing to <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> the playoffs with a total of 87 points, the worst record of any playoff team in the shootout era (since 2005-06). In the first round, the Wild fell to the Central Division champion Dallas Stars in 6 games. During the 2016 offseason, the Wild acquired Eric Staal through free agency, and signed him to a three-year deal. The Wild also hired Bruce Boudreau as their new head coach, replacing interim head coach John Torchetti.|$|E
500|$|As the Japanese fleet moved in, the Chinese fleet {{moved away}} from anchor and {{attempted}} for form up in a line. However, the manoeuvre was botched and Chaoyong {{was one of four}} ships which ended up behind the others. This was {{due to a lack of}} maintenance over the years; with their equipment out of date, they could <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> [...] Orders had been given for the ships to operate in pairs, with Chaoyong and Yangwei teamed together. This battle plan was alien to the premise of their design, inherent in the lack of armour for ships about to fight in the line of battle.|$|E

500|$|Later on {{the first}} day of the battle, the hard-pressed battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group were being pursued by their British opponents. Schlesien and the other {{so-called}} [...] "five-minute ships" [...] came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons. Schlesien and her sisters could <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> out a target in the darkness. Due to the poor visibility their shooting was ineffective. The British battlecruisers scored several hits on the German ships; in the brief melee a near miss from a large-caliber gun sprayed shell splinters onto Schlesiens decks, killing one man and wounding another. Admiral Mauve ordered an 8-point turn to the south, and the British did not follow.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the action}} Tripoli was {{severely}} damaged; 30of her crew were dead and another 30were injured. The polacca's first lieutenant was among the casualties and Admiral Rous himself was injured in the fighting. In what amounted to a total American victory over the Tripolitans, Enterprise had suffered only superficial damage and no casualties. [...] Sterett, whose orders did not give him the authority to retain prizes, let the polacca limp back to Tripoli. However, before setting her free, the Americans cut down Tripoli masts and sufficiently disabled her so that she could <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> sail. Sterett then continued his journey to Malta and picked up the supplies for which he was sent before returning to the blockade.|$|E
500|$|In his memoir, Eminent Hipsters, Fagen {{notes that}} the cover figure [...] "wasn't {{supposed}} to be a stand-in for any particular jazz DJ," [...] but noted a few personalities from the period that factored into the creation: Ed Beach, Dan Morgenstern, Martin Williams, R.D. Harlan, [...] "Symphony Sid" [...] Torin, and what Fagen regarded as his [...] "main man", WEVD's Mort Fega. [...] "He was laid-back, knowledgeable, and forthright, the cool uncle you wished you'd had." [...] At the time of the album's release, he remembered that jazz music offered him an escape from the adults in his life: [...] "When I saw E.T.,' I realized that the E.T. in my bedroom was my Thelonious Monk records. Everything that he represented was totally unworldly in a way, although at the same time jazz to me seemed more real than the environment in which I was living." [...] The Wall Street Journal Robert J. Toth writes, [...] "The cover adds another layer of autobiography. On the front, we see Mr. Fagen as a crew-cut deejay on the graveyard shift. On the back is his audience, a single lighted window in a row of tract homes — or maybe the artist as a young man, drinking in inspiration." [...] Robert Palmer, of The New York Times, continued in this line of thinking: [...] "Inside, there's a teenager with his ear next to a portable radio. He's playing it softly, so his parents won't wake up, and he can <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> out the sounds through the static. [...] The teenager was Donald Fagen." ...|$|E

500|$|In [...] "The Wars to Come", Stannis enlists Jon as an {{intermediary}} {{between himself and}} Mance, hoping to add the wildling army to his own. Mance refuses to submit to Stannis, and the wildling king is {{burned at the stake}} by the red priestess Melisandre. In [...] "The House of Black and White", Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and make him lord of Winterfell in exchange for his support. Jon is voted the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, initially tying with his nemesis Thorne but having the tie settled by Maester Aemon. Jon's intent to welcome the wildlings into Westeros and grant them lands by the Wall further enrages Thorne's faction of the Watch, who hold a deep seated hatred for the wildlings. In [...] "Hardhome", Jon travels by ship north of the Wall to the eponymous wildling village, seeking their support for his plan to ally the Night's Watch and the wildlings against the growing threat of the White Walkers. As some the wildling clans board Stannis' ships to travel south, a massive force of wights, led by White Walkers and their Night King, attacks the village. Jon kills a White Walker with Longclaw, learning that weapons forged with Valyrian steel can destroy them completely. Jon and his group <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> it out alive, with {{only a fraction of the}} wildling forces. Jon then permits the wildling forces to pass through the Wall into the North. Shortly after returning to Castle Black in the season finale [...] "Mother's Mercy", Jon is summoned to hear news of his missing uncle Benjen, but is instead stabbed to death by Thorne and his group of mutineers.|$|E
2500|$|The Russian {{expression}} [...] "Перебиваться с хлеба на квас" [...] (literally [...] "to clamber from {{bread to}} kvass") means to <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> ends meet, remotely similar to (and may be translated as) the expression [...] "to {{be on the}} breadline". To better understand the Russian phrase one has to know that in poor families kvass was made from stale leftovers of rye bread.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{point of}} {{interest}} dating {{from the time of}} the Revolution, when Christianity was suppressed and Saint-Sulpice became a place for worship of the [...] "Supreme Being", is a printed sign over the center door of the main entrance. One can still <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> out the printed words ‘’Le Peuple Francais Reconnoit L’Etre Suprême Et L’Immortalité de L’Âme’’ ("The French people recognize the Supreme Being and the immortality of the soul"). Further questions of interest are the fate of the frieze that this must have replaced, the persons responsible for placing this manifesto and the reasons that it has been left in place.|$|E

50|$|When the Ceres {{lands on}} Callisto, the crew find a {{previous}} scoutship, the Phobos, still intact. An {{inspection of the}} Phobos reveals it to be covered with dried slime, and the bodies of its crew are discovered. Soon a horde of four-foot-long slugs emerges from a nearby lake and approaches the Phobos. Two of the Ceres crewmen are overcome by a mysterious affliction, and a third <b>barely</b> <b>makes</b> {{it back to the}} ship. The captain of the Ceres realizes that the slugs are using magnetic fields to stun the crewmen, amplified by their steel space suits. Fields volunteers to retrieve the unconscious crewmen in his rubber space suit. He brings the first back, but while retrieving the second he falls victim to an air leak and <b>barely</b> <b>makes</b> it back to the ship. Fields and the unconscious crewmen all survive, and Ceres safely departs Callisto.|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times {{commented that}} The Seagull,' with its {{depiction}} of fin de siècle ennui, has been hollowed out and trivialized.

The avian symbol has been changed from a sea gull to a bald eagle. What remains is a cracked shell." ...|$|R
2500|$|At this time, {{the main}} engines of Louisiana had been installed, but {{those for the}} screws, needed for steering, had not. Furthermore, the main engines {{were found to be}} inadequate; even at dangerously high boiler pressure, she could <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> headway against the river current. Unable to move on her own, she had to be towed down to the forts, with workmen still aboard. [...] There she was tied to the left bank (here, {{the north side of the}} river) a short {{distance}} above Fort St. Philip. This did not completely mollify General Duncan, who wanted the ship to be positioned below the forts, but Commander Whittle would not risk his vessel, with unarmored deck, against the plunging fire of the Union mortars. She remained at this position throughout the ensuing battle.|$|E
2500|$|Ullman, who {{had been}} living an upper-middle class life, was uprooted to Hackbridge, {{southwest}} London, along with her older sister Patti and her mother, who could now <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> ends meet without their father's income. [...] "After [...] died, our fortunes came and went because Mum couldn’t speak Polish and {{had to give up}} the business." [...] Mother Dorin would go on to take a host of odd jobs. [...] "My mother was always doing strange things like driving parts around for a garage, all covered in oil and paid 10 pounds a week. But she was very funny, and our defence against hardship was having a great sense of humour." [...] On a separate occasion, on the subject of her mother's jobs, Ullman recalled: [...] " [...] worked in a laboratory, testing food, and would bring home samples for our dinner. Sometimes she'd have to report that formula X had been found unfit for human consumption." [...] Despite reality, their mother maintained that they were middle-class. [...] "My mother always insisted on middle-class because we had money at one time. We're really lower-middle." ...|$|E

They contented themselves with seats quite close to the door. No drinks were being served here. Although one or two men were smoking, the general aspect seemed {{to be one of}} stern and serious intensity. A man upon the platform was just finishing speaking as they entered, and he apparently called upon some one else. A large and heavy German stood up on the centre of the slightly raised stage. He wore shapeless clothes and horn-rimmed spectacles. His face was benevolent. He had a double chin and a soft voice.|$|E
