5|$|During the Middle Ages, Capetian Kings of France {{chose to}} have their heirs {{apparent}} crowned during their own lifetime {{in order to avoid}} succession disputes. This practice was later adopted by Angevin Kings of England, Kings of Hungary and other European monarchs. From the moment of their coronation, the heirs were regarded as junior kings (rex iunior), but they exercised little power and historically {{were not included in the}} numbering of monarchs if they predeceased their fathers. The nobility disliked this custom, as it reduced their chances to <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> possible succession dispute.|$|E

5|$|The algae <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{safe place}} to live and consume the polyp's carbon dioxide and {{nitrogenous}} waste. Due to the strain the algae can put on the polyp, stress on the coral often drives them to eject the algae. Mass ejections are known as coral bleaching, because the algae contribute to coral's brown coloration; other colors, however, are due to host coral pigments, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). Ejection increases the polyp's chance of surviving short-term stress—they can regain algae, possibly of a different species at a later time. If the stressful conditions persist, the polyp eventually dies.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} use of supplemental vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk}} of lung cancer. Some studies suggest that people who eat diets with a higher proportion of vegetables and fruit tend to have a lower risk, but {{this may be due to}} confounding—with the lower risk actually due to the association of a high fruit/vegetables diet with less smoking. Several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk, although meta-analysis that accounts for smoking status may show <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> healthy diet.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E

5|$|Amazing {{raised its}} price from 75 cents to $1.00 with the November 1975 issue. The {{schedule}} switched to quarterly {{beginning with the}} March 1976 issue; as a result, the 50th anniversary issue had a cover date of June 1976. In 1977, Cohen announced that Amazing and Fantastic had lost $15,000, though Amazings circulation (at nearly 26,000) {{was as good as}} it had been for several years. Cohen looked for a new publisher to buy the magazines, but in September of the following year sold his half-share in the company to his partner, Arthur Bernhard. White had occasionally suggested to Cohen that Amazing would <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> redesign and investment; he made the same suggestions to Bernhard in early October. According to White, Bernhard not only said no, but told him he would not receive a salary until the next issue was turned in. In late 1978 White resigned, and returned all manuscripts in his possession to their authors, even if copy-edited and ready for publication. White claimed Bernhard had told him to do this, though Bernhard denied it.|$|E
5|$|Angel sharks {{in general}} are highly {{threatened}} by commercial trawl fisheries due to their susceptibility to capture and low rate of reproduction, and angel shark species elsewhere {{are known to have}} declined markedly under fishing pressure. Trawling activity in the Yellow Sea {{and other parts of the}} northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to 50% or more under these conditions, leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It may <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government, though enforcement is inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|Colorado held several {{meetings}} to convince reluctant Utah officials they would <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> freeway link between Denver and Salt Lake City. Utah officials expressed concerns that, given the terrain between these cities, this link {{would be difficult}} to build. They later expressed concerns that the construction would drain resources from completing Interstate Highways they deemed to have a higher priority. Colorado officials persisted, presenting three alternatives to route I-70 west of Denver, using the corridors of US40, US6 and a route starting at Pueblo, proceeding west along US50/US285/US24. In March 1955, Colorado officials succeeded in convincing Utah officials with the state legislature passing a resolution supporting a link with Denver. The two states jointly issued a proposal to the U.S. Congress that would extend the plans for I-70 along the US6 corridor. Under this proposal the freeway would terminate at I-15 near Spanish Fork, Utah, linking the Front Range and Wasatch Front metropolitan areas.|$|E

5|$|Embedded in the {{calcareous}} skeleton are numerous microscopic polyps. They are connected internally {{by a system}} of canals and are concealed behind pores in the skeleton, the surface of which is smooth and lacks the corallites of true stony corals. The polyps have specialist functions, the gastrozooids processing and digesting the food caught by the dactylzooids which are grouped around them. The gastrozooids are small and plump and extend four to six tentacle stubs through their pores but are otherwise invisible. The dactylzooids have hairlike tentacles covered in cnidoblasts. Stings from the cnidocysts immobilize an item of prey and the tentacles thrust it through the mouth of an adjacent gastrozooid, from where it passes into the stomach for digestion. The polyps also extrude the coenosteum, the calcareous material of which the skeleton is composed. The coenosteum contains certain symbiotic microalgae called zooxanthellae. These are photosynthetic organisms which provide their hosts with energy and in return <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> protective environment in a well lit position. About 75% of the fire coral's energy requirements are provided by the zooxanthellae.|$|E
5|$|The {{comparative}} age and {{proximity of}} their stadiums {{has led to}} various discussions {{about the possibility of}} both Dundee clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium. The most recent proposal was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to jointly host the UEFA Euro 2008 championship, with several clubs seeking to <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> new stadium. With planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park, special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules at the time forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved, although it was resurrected in June 2008, following doubts about joint-host Ukraine's ability to stage Euro 2012, and the SFA's keenness to act as an alternative host.|$|E
5|$|When a {{vegetable}} is harvested, it {{is cut off}} from its source of water and nourishment. It continues to transpire and loses moisture as it does so, a process most noticeable in the wilting of green leafy crops. Harvesting root vegetables when they are fully mature improves their storage life, but alternatively, these root crops can {{be left in the}} ground and harvested over an extended period. The harvesting process should seek to minimise damage and bruising to the crop. Onions and garlic can be dried for a few days in the field and root crops such as potatoes <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> short maturation period in warm, moist surroundings, during which time wounds heal and the skin thickens up and hardens. Before marketing or storage, grading {{needs to be done to}} remove damaged goods and select produce according to its quality, size, ripeness, and color.|$|E
