5|$|As we {{understand}} the situation here, the Australian Constitution firmly places the prerogative powers of the Crown {{in the hands of}} the Governor-General as the representative of the Queen of Australia. The only person competent to commission an Australian Prime Minister is the Governor-General, and The Queen has no part in the decisions which the Governor-General must take in accordance with the Constitution. Her Majesty, as Queen of Australia, is watching events in Canberra with close interest and attention, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be proper for her to intervene in person in matters which are so clearly placed within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General by the Constitution Act.|$|E
5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be the speed of photons.|$|E
5|$|Dowding {{later wrote}} a memo {{considering}} several aircraft for the role, rejecting the Boulton Paul Defiant two-seat fighter {{due to its}} cramped rear turret area. He was sure the Bristol Beaufighter would be perfect for the role, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be ready for some time. So he selected the Bristol Blenheim light bomber for the immediate term, sending two of the early prototypes to Martlesham Heath to be fitted with the radar from the Battles. Blenheim K7033 was fitted with the radar, while K7034 acted as the target. Both of these aircraft lost a propeller in flight but landed safely; K7033s propeller was never found, but K7034s was returned to Martlesham the next day by an irate farmer.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, {{construction}} resumed on roadways throughout Ontario. The expressway between Highland Creek and Oshawa {{was completed}} in December 1947, while other sections languished. The Toronto–Barrie Highway was {{the primary focus of}} the Department of Highways at the time, and the onset of the Korean War in 1950 stalled construction again. Despite the delays, highway minister George Doucett officially announced the plans for construction of the new trans-provincial expressway that year, with the Toronto to Oshawa expressway serving {{as a model for the}} design. Work on the most important link, the Toronto Bypass, began in 1951, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> open with that name.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq to hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry from}} the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be a replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E
5|$|Curie and {{her husband}} {{declined}} to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person; they were too busy with their work, and Pierre, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill. As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905. The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant. Following the award of the Nobel Prize, and galvanized by an offer from the University of Geneva, which offered Pierre a position, the University of Paris gave Pierre a professorship and the chair of physics, although the Curies still {{did not have a}} proper laboratory. Upon Pierre's complaint, the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be ready until 1906.|$|E

5|$|Gaudron, and jointly Gleeson, Gummow and Hayne, {{decided that}} the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 validly conferred the {{jurisdiction}} to determine disputed elections on the High Court, in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns. They said that if Hill's argument about {{the structure of the}} Act were correct, there would be the odd result that the court could hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Act itself (which imposes certain requirements for candidates), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be able to hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Constitution. They also said that if only a house of Parliament could dispute a candidate's constitutional eligibility, then in the time it took for that house to determine the issue, an ineligible candidate would be able to participate in the business of that house, including passing laws and other activities.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Woolley {{redirected}} the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research {{towards the}} study of stars and galaxies. It took time to get the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: they had to be overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap. Woolley got funding approval from the Prime Minister for construction of a 74-inch telescope, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be finished for years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric photometry, using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer Gerald Kron from California's Lick Observatory, he observed Cepheid variable stars, which are used to measure astronomical distances. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch reflector telescope – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the Small Magellanic Cloud and, later, the Large Magellanic Cloud. They also examined the colours of star clusters in the Small Cloud.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by Lloyd F. Lonergan, but {{the director of the}} film is uncredited. Little is known of the production, but a review in The New York Dramatic Mirror made the assumption that the scenes were shot in the morning. The film starred Florence La Badie, who was the most prominent player of the Thanhouser Company and frequently in the leading roles of films including the The Million Dollar Mystery which would captivate the United States. The role of the father was played, Sidney Bracy, was a stage actor of considerable experience who claimed to have been affiliated with the Thanhouser players since 1910. Though Q. David Bowers says that it is probably an incorrect assertion, it is possible that Bracy may not have been a full-time member of the company. Bracy's first credited work appears in 1913, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be until The Million Dollar Mystery that Bracy would garner much attention in the role of Jones, the Butler. The role of the doctor was played by Arthur Bauer who was a veteran of the stage and film, through the Great Northern Film Company, before signing onto the Thanhouser Company. The announcement of Bauer's role at Thanhouser came after the release of sixteen films, including Adrift in the Great City, on March 21, 1914. Lila Chester, played the role of a nurse in the production. Chester was claimed by a Thanhouser publicist to have appeared in over 400 films by February 14, 1914. Bowers reasons that if these productions were with Thanhouser, than most of them had to be minor roles {{because of the lack of}} attention and credits she was given. The one reel drama film, approximately 1008 feet long, was filmed in New York City and New Rochelle, New York.|$|E
