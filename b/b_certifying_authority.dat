30|$|At step (1), a {{challenge}} message {{with a fresh}} nonce is issued to a platform (in this case, the TED) to attest its identity and integrity with the application service. Once this message is received, the TED platform at step (2) calls a TPM function to generate an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) and the TPM credentials. These credentials, along with other credentialsa the public part of the AIK and the original challenge nonce are signed by the private TPM Endorsement Key. The resulting signed credential is then encrypted using the public part of the <b>certifying</b> <b>authority’s</b> key. This is then sent at step (3) to the <b>certifying</b> <b>authority</b> as a request to validate its credentials. If successful, the <b>certifying</b> <b>authority</b> creates a signed, encrypted credential that is {{sent back to the}} platform at step (4). Step (5) is used to produce an encrypted summary of measurements of the environment held in sealed storage (the Platform Configuration Registers, or PCR) in the TPM chip. (e.g. one measurement may be a list of loaded and running processes just after boot, another measurement may be a new list of running processes several hours after boot). This encrypted measurement information is then sent back to the challenger, along with the identity credential received from the <b>certifying</b> <b>authority</b> at step (6). Upon reception of the message, the challenging application service now validates at step (7) the measured environment and compares it to its own expected measurements that it holds. During this process, the challenging application service checks the identity credential to determine that it was signed by the <b>certifying</b> <b>authority,</b> as well as verifying the signature of the measured values and that it contains the original challenge nonce. Depending on the application requirements, step (8) may optionally be used to signal to the application client the success of the measurement and attestation process.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is {{a network}} {{consisting}} {{of a collection of}} nodes capable of communicating with each other without the help from a network infrastructure. Although security issues in mobile ad hoc networks have been a major focus in the recent years, the development of fully secure schemes for these networks has not been entirely achieved till now. MANETs have a unique characteristics and constraints that make traditional approaches to security inadequate. The lack of an infrastructure exacerbates the situation of using shared secret keys or authentication among members. Therefore, the issues of authentication, key distribution and intrusion detection require different methods, which are discussed here. In this paper, we propose to combine efficient techniques from elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and a distributed intrusion detection system (IDS) based on threshold cryptography. And also propose to use a distributed <b>certifying</b> <b>authority</b> (CA) along with per-packet per-hop authentication for addressing the issues mentioned above. The model assumes that no single node can be trusted and relies instead on a distributed trust model.
