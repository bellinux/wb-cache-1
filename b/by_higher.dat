A storm surge of , topped <b>by</b> <b>higher</b> waves, damaged eastern sections of the city with extensive flooding in downtown, the Battleship Parkway, and the elevated Jubilee Parkway.

5|$|A {{special case}} of natural {{selection}} is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates. Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, large body size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males. This survival disadvantage is balanced <b>by</b> <b>higher</b> reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.|$|E
5|$|As they hovered {{above the}} target, however, the first {{helicopter}} experienced a hazardous airflow condition {{known as a}} vortex ring state. This was aggravated <b>by</b> <b>higher</b> than expected air temperature ("a so-called 'hot and high' environment") and the high compound walls, which stopped the rotor downwash from diffusing. The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the helicopter rolled onto its side. The pilot quickly buried the aircraft's nose {{to keep it from}} tipping over. None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall. The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside. The SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, the {{defensive}} qualities of Castle Rising {{have since been}} extensively debated. The historian Robert Liddiard argues that the large windows at Castle Rising {{would have been a}} significant weakness, as {{it would have been easy}} to fire arrows through them from the bailey, and George Garnett has questioned the utility of {{the defensive}} arrow slits, which he suggests were not well positioned or designed. The whole site was also overlooked <b>by</b> <b>higher</b> ground, which Liddiard considers would have been a key defensive weakness.|$|E
5|$|Ebrey {{argues that}} {{although}} most of Emperor Wu's fiscal policies were repealed during Eastern Han, their damage to the merchant class and the subsequent laissez-faire policies of Eastern Han allowed the wealthiest landowners to dominate society, ensuring that China's economy would remain firmly agrarian-based for centuries. The Eastern Han central government lost {{an important source of}} revenue by relinquishing its salt and iron industries and purchasing its armies' swords and shields from private manufacturers. However, this loss of revenue was often compensated <b>by</b> <b>higher</b> taxes levied on the merchants.|$|E
5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded <b>by</b> <b>higher</b> levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E

5|$|The area is {{also home}} to a number of {{commercial}} and public art galleries; including the newly expanded Whitechapel Gallery. The artists Gilbert and George have long made their home and workshop in Spitalfields, and the neighbourhood around Hoxton Square has become a centre for modern British art, including the White Cube gallery, with many artists from the Young British Artists movement living and working in the area. This has made the area around Hoxton and Shoreditch fashionable, with many former residents now driven out <b>by</b> <b>higher</b> property prices, and a busy nightlife has developed, with over 80 licensed premises around Shoreditch.|$|E

5|$|The {{landscape}} {{consists of}} {{the valley of the}} River Chew and is generally low-lying and undulating. It is bounded <b>by</b> <b>higher</b> ground ranging from Dundry Down to the north, the Lulsgate Plateau to the west, the Mendip Hills to the south and the Hinton Blewett, Marksbury and Newton St Loe plateau areas to the east. The valley's boundary generally follows the top of scarp slopes except at the southwestern and southeastern boundaries where flat upper areas of the Chew Valley grade gently into the Yeo Valley and eastern Mendip Hills respectively. The River Chew was dammed in the 1950s to create Chew Valley Lake, which provides drinking water for the nearby city of Bristol and surrounding areas. The lake is a prominent landscape feature of the valley, a focus for recreation, and is internationally recognised for its nature conservation interest, because of the bird species, plants and insects.|$|E
5|$|The tale of Nandanar is retold {{numerous}} times in folk tales, folk music, plays, films and literature in Tamil society. While Nandanar {{is included in}} Nayanar list since the 8th century CE, the 12th century CE Periya Puranam gives a full hagiographical account of his life. The tale focuses on two miracles attributed to him. In Sivalokanathar Temple, Tirupunkur; his prayers {{are said to have}} moved a giant stone bull, which still appears in the moved position in the temple. Nandanar is said to have ritually purified himself by fire at Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram. Nandar's tale features in temple lore and religious literature related to both these temples. Gopalakrishna Bharati's 19th century retelling of the saint's life remains the basis of many later retellings. It expands the original narrative adding elements of oppression of the Dalit saint <b>by</b> <b>higher</b> castes. While higher caste retellings of the tale focus on the saint's observance of caste norms, Dalits emphasize his exploitation and superior religiosity.|$|E
5|$|Thomas's new castle {{adapted the}} {{existing}} manor complex overlooking {{the head of}} the River Frome. Although the castle sat on a low spur it was overlooked <b>by</b> <b>higher</b> ground from the west and the north and was not ideally placed from a purely defensive perspective. Contemporary castle designs included the construction of huge, palatial tower keeps and apartments for the most powerful nobles, such as Kenilworth, expanded by Thomas's patron, John of Gaunt; or the construction of smaller, French influenced castles such as that seen at nearby Nunney Castle, built by one of Thomas's fellow nouveau riche landowners. By contrast, Farleigh Hungerford drew on the tradition of quadrangular castles that had begun in France during the early 13th century, in which the traditional buildings of an unfortified manor were enclosed by a four-sided outer wall and protected with corner towers. The style was well established by the late 14th century, even slightly old fashioned.|$|E

5|$|Vice Admiral Scheer became Commander {{in chief}} of the High Seas Fleet on 18 January 1916 when Pohl became too ill to {{continue}} in that post. Upon promotion to the position, Scheer wrote Guiding Principles for Sea Warfare in the North Sea, which outlined his strategic plans. His central idea was that the Grand Fleet should be pressured <b>by</b> <b>higher</b> U-boat activity and zeppelin raids as well as increased fleet sorties. The Grand Fleet would be forced to abandon the distant blockade and would have to attack the German fleet; the Kaiser approved the memorandum on 23 February 1916. Now that he had approval from the Kaiser, Scheer could use the fleet more aggressively.|$|E
5|$|Factors {{required}} {{for the formation of}} medicanes are somewhat different than that normally expected of tropical cyclones; known to emerge over regions with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) below , Mediterranean tropical cyclones often require incursions of colder air to induce atmospheric instability. A majority of medicanes develop above regions of the Mediterranean with SSTs of , with the upper bound only found in the southernmost reaches of the sea. Despite the low sea surface temperatures, the instability incited by cold atmospheric air within a baroclinic zone—regions with high differences in temperature and pressure—permits the formation of medicanes, in contrast to tropical areas lacking high baroclinity, where raised SSTs are needed. While significant deviations in air temperature have been noted around the time of Mediterranean tropical cyclones' formation, few anomalies in sea surface temperature coincide with their development, indicating that the formation of medicanes is primarily controlled <b>by</b> <b>higher</b> air temperatures, not by anomalous SSTs. Similar to tropical cyclones, minimal wind shear—difference in wind speed and direction over a region—as well as abundant moisture and vorticity encourages the genesis of tropical cyclone-like systems in the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{activity}} in 1991 was below normal. This was partially due to decreased tropical cyclogenesis from African tropical waves, which are troughs that {{move across the}} ocean with associated convection. In most seasons, the majority of storms develop from tropical waves. Of the season's twelve tropical cyclones, only five originated from tropical waves; in addition, {{only three of the}} eight tropical storms were from tropical waves, and none had the characteristics of a Cape Verde-type hurricane. From late April to late November, there were 73tropical waves that exited the west coast of Africa. The total was higher than average, although many of them were poorly defined and had little thunderstorm activity. The waves traversed the Atlantic Ocean further south than normal, typically not becoming convectively active until moving across northern South America. Cyclogenesis was also suppressed <b>by</b> <b>higher</b> than normal wind shear, as well as low rainfall amounts across the Sahel. There were also no tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico for only the third time in the 20th century, after 1927 and 1962. The season produced twelve tropical depressions, which was the lowest in five years. The eight tropical storms was the lowest amount in four years. Four of the storms developed into hurricanes, although {{for the first time in}} over 24years, none of the hurricanes originated from tropical waves.|$|E
