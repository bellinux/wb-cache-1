Obvious examples include foodborne and waterborne pathogens and also pathogens that are transmitted by hands or aerosols. In the NCE, pathogens have to cope with the presence of toxic compounds, sub-optimal temperature, starvation, presence of competitors and predators. Adaptation of <b>bacterial</b> <b>pathogens</b> to such stresses affects their interaction with the host.

40|$|AbstractTo cause disease, <b>bacterial</b> <b>pathogens</b> {{must first}} breach {{physical}} barriers, {{such as the}} mucous membrane that lines organs, and then successfully replicate and disseminate while avoiding destruction by the immune system. Many <b>bacterial</b> <b>pathogens</b> accomplish this by secreting proteins into their host environment, which act to subvert or dampen the expanding immune response. Here, we discuss how <b>bacterial</b> <b>pathogens</b> use an arsenal of secreted virulence proteins to modify the outcome of innate immune activation by altering how the immune system recognizes microbial invaders...|$|R

Intensified studies on bacterial pathogenesis have greatly expanded our knowledge about the mechanisms of the disease processes at the molecular level over the last decades.

40|$|Host {{recognition}} of <b>bacterial</b> <b>pathogens</b> {{is a critical}} component of the immune response. Intracellular <b>bacterial</b> <b>pathogens</b> are able to evade the humoral immune system by residing within the host cell. Here we show the existence of an innate host surveillance mechanism in macrophages that specifically distinguishes bacteria in the cytosol from bacteria in the vacuole. Recognition of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial products by this surveillance system results in transcription of the ifnb gene. The activation of cytosol-specific signaling is associated with translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus and phosphorylation of the p 38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Activation of the p 38 kinase is required for the induction of gene expression by the cytosolic surveillance pathway. Our studies suggest that infection by intracellular <b>bacterial</b> <b>pathogens</b> results in an immune response distinct from that of infection by extracellular <b>bacterial</b> <b>pathogens...</b>|$|R

40|$|Nested PCR {{method was}} {{used in the present study}} for {{detection}} of pathogenic bacteria in clinical body fluids. This method permitted a reliable amplification of 16 S rRNA of common <b>bacterial</b> <b>pathogens</b> in body fluids with 1 CFU mL - 1 sensitivity threshold in detection. A total of 36 clinical fluid specimens (9 peritoneal, 9 synovial, 9 pleural and 9 cerebrospinal fluids) were analyzed. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>pathogens</b> in 26 specimens were successfully detected by culture-based method and by nested PCR method. Whereas, DNA extracts from seven fluid specimens which showed no bacterial growth on conventional media were positively amplified by nested PCR. Thus, nested PCR method proved to be more rapid and more sensitive than culturing method in detection of <b>bacterial</b> <b>pathogens,</b> including fastidious and low levels of bacteria, in clinical body fluids. In conclusion, nested PCR method is worth considering in detection protocols of <b>bacterial</b> <b>pathogens</b> in clinical body fluids...|$|R
