25|$|Greg's Best <b>Bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Radio From Yesterday - A daily {{feature on}} the early breakfast and {{afternoon}} shows. Greg played out a clip from another radio station that he finds amusing, usually of slip ups. On Monday, this would be Greg's Best <b>Bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Radio from Friday.|$|E
25|$|Other {{problems}} {{may arise from}} non-uniform distributions used in cryptography. For example, consider a 1000000-digit binary one-time pad using exclusive or. If the pad has 1000000 bits of entropy, it is perfect. If the pad has 999999 bits of entropy, evenly distributed (each individual <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pad having 0.999999 bits of entropy) it may provide good security. But if the pad has 999999 bits of entropy, where the first bit is fixed and the remaining 999999 bits are perfectly random, then the first <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ciphertext will not be encrypted at all.|$|E
25|$|Some {{other objects}} that may conduct sparks are plastic/holographic print thermoses (such as Starbuck's novelty cups) or cups with metal lining. If any <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metal is exposed, all {{the outer shell}} will burst off the object or melt.|$|E
50|$|XOR <b>the</b> {{remaining}} <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ciphertext with leftmost <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> re-encrypted block.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{first four}} <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> code point {{are stored in}} the {{remaining}} low order four <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> this byte (...) , leaving 12 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> code point yet to be encoded (...) [...]|$|R
2500|$|The four most {{significant}} <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> code point {{are stored in}} the remaining low order four <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> this byte (1110 [...] ), leaving 12 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> code point yet to be encoded (...).|$|R
25|$|The Unicode {{standard}} encodes 8-dot braille glyphs {{according to}} their binary appearance, rather than following their assigned numeric order. Dot 1 corresponds to the least significant <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low byte of the Unicode scalar value, and dot 8 to the high bit of that byte.|$|E
25|$|The Blunder Log - The natural {{successor}} to 'Best <b>Bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Radio'. It involved Greg playing out clips of mistakes from other radio stations or TV programmes. This feature {{began on the}} drivetime show, and happened sporadically. It hasn't featured since early 2013.|$|E
25|$|Busch had his outbreaking {{race for}} his new team at Fontana. He led a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race after Jimmie Johnson blew a tire with 7 laps to go. He led on the restart against {{teammate}} Tony Stewart but lost the lead on the final lap after allowing Kyle Busch to slip past and win.|$|E
50|$|To use CFB {{to make a}} self-synchronizing {{stream cipher}} that will {{synchronize}} for any multiple <b>of</b> x <b>bits</b> lost, start by initializing a shift register <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> block size with the initialization vector. This is encrypted with the block cipher, and <b>the</b> highest x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> result are XOR'ed with x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plaintext to produce x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> ciphertext. These x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> output are shifted into the shift register, and the process repeats with <b>the</b> next x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> plaintext. Decryption is similar, start with the initialization vector, encrypt, and XOR <b>the</b> high <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> result with x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ciphertext to produce x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> plaintext. Then shift <b>the</b> x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ciphertext into the shift register. This way of proceeding is known as CFB-8 or CFB-1 (according to <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shifting).|$|R
50|$|If the {{high-order}} bit is 0, <b>the</b> lower 16 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> address {{refer to a}} location in the first 64K words of main memory; if the {{high-order bit}} is 1, <b>the</b> lower 16 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> address refer to a location in a 64K-word block of memory specified by the Extension Address in <b>bits</b> 42-47 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Program Status Doubleword, with the Extension Address being concatenated with <b>the</b> lower 16 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference address to form the physical address.|$|R
25|$|Finally <b>the</b> {{last six}} <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> code point {{are stored in}} the low order six <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final byte, and again 10 is stored in the high order two bits (10).|$|R
25|$|Because the P-array is 576 bits long, {{and the key}} bytes are XORed {{through all}} these 576 bits during the initialization, many {{implementations}} support key sizes up to 576 bits. While this is certainly possible, the 448 bits limit is here to ensure that every bit of every subkey depends on every <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key, as the last four values of the P-array don't affect every <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ciphertext. This point should be taken in consideration for implementations with a different number of rounds, as even though it increases security against an exhaustive attack, it weakens the security guaranteed by the algorithm. And given the slow initialization of the cipher with each change of key, it is granted a natural protection against brute-force attacks, which doesn't really justify key sizes longer than 448 bits.|$|E
25|$|A heartbroken Rapunzel grieves for Eugene. However, her tears, {{which still}} contain a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun's power, land {{on his cheek}} and restore his life. The two return to the kingdom and Rapunzel reunites with her parents. The kingdom breaks out in celebration, and Eugene is pardoned for his crimes. Rapunzel and Eugene {{eventually}} marry.|$|E
25|$|Oddly enough, this Baldrick {{seems to}} have a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idiot savant in him; Baldrick's explanation, {{although}} heard from someone else, of why George and Blackadder will be able to trade places is surprisingly smart and articulate, suggesting he might have an amazing memory with words, even if he does not understand what they mean.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that when}} using 4 bits to modify a colour {{component}} {{you should use}} the 4 bits in <b>the</b> upper 4 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> component AND in the lower 4 bits (to avoid reducing the overall colour gamut). When using 6 bits this is less important, {{but you can still}} put the 2 most significant <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modification <b>bits</b> into the least significant two <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colour component.|$|R
50|$|The {{subnet mask}} is a bitmask {{that can be}} used to {{separate}} <b>the</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network identifier from <b>the</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> host identifier. It is often written in the same notation used to denote IP addresses.|$|R
5000|$|For FAT32 devices, <b>the</b> lower 16 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{physical}} address is normally {{retained in the}} directory entry, but <b>the</b> high <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> address are zeroed down. Many recovery programs ignore this fact and fail to recover data correctly.|$|R
25|$|Modified {{digital cameras}} can detect some ultraviolet, {{all of the}} visible {{and much of the}} near {{infrared}} spectrum, as most digital imaging sensors are sensitive from about 350nm to 1000nm. An off-the-shelf digital camera contains an infrared hot mirror filter that blocks most of the infrared and a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ultraviolet that would otherwise be detected by the sensor, narrowing the accepted range from about 400nm to 700nm.|$|E
25|$|The Polyjuice Potion {{allows the}} drinker {{to assume the}} {{appearance}} of someone else {{for an hour or}} more depending on the quantity. The potion only causes a physical transformation of the drinker, but clothing and voice is not affected. Its ingredients include fluxweed, knotgrass, lacewing flies, leeches, powdered Bicorn horn, and shredded Boomslang skin. The final component is a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual to be impersonated; strands of hair are most often used for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|A <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cloth was {{radiocarbon}} dated in {{the late}} 1980s. It gave as result a 68 percent likelihood of a date between 1290 and 1410 and a 95 percent likelihood of a date between 1290 and 1430. Some uncertainties do however arise as the conservation process might have affected the result. The fact that the find came from a bog is also of concern, as bog finds {{are known to be}} hard to date.|$|E
5000|$|Segment Limit : 20 <b>bit</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> segment. How {{exactly this}} should be {{interpreted}} depends on other <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> segment descriptor.|$|R
5000|$|A similar {{concept is}} zero extension. On x64, most {{instructions}} that write to <b>the</b> lower 32 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general-purpose registers will zero <b>the</b> upper half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> destination register. For example, the instruction [...] will clear <b>the</b> upper 32 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rax register.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the binary}} integer significand version, where the {{exponent}} changed position and {{came before the}} significand, this encoding combines <b>the</b> leading 2 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exponent and the leading digit (3 or 4 <b>bits)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> significand into the five bits that follow the sign bit.|$|R
25|$|Typical {{algorithms}} {{that are}} exact and yet run in sub-linear time use parallel processing (as the NC1 matrix determinant calculation does), non-classical processing (as Grover's search does), or alternatively have guaranteed assumptions on the input structure (as the logarithmic time binary search and many tree maintenance algorithms do). However, formal languages {{such as the}} set of all strings that have a 1-bit in the position indicated by the first log(n) bits of the string may depend on every <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input and yet be computable in sub-linear time.|$|E
25|$|An edge connects {{vertices}} x and y in {{the graph}} (where x<nbsp&y) whenever the xth <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> binary representation of y is nonzero. Thus, for instance, the neighbors of vertex 0 consist of all odd-numbered vertices, because the numbers whose 0th bit is nonzero {{are exactly the}} odd numbers. The neighbors of vertex 1 consist of vertex 0 (previously identified because 1 is odd) and all vertices with numbers congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 4 (because those are exactly the numbers with a nonzero bit at index 1), every {{one of which is}} greater than 1.|$|E
25|$|Based on an {{understanding}} of what a positive impact a strong family unit can have on both individuals and community, The Sebastian Foundation looks to provide a little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warmth and benefit of family where it might be missing through serious illness, underprivilege or domestic violence. Project based, the Foundation seeks to help where the need is – they have renovated kitchens, gardens, and living areas in women's refuges, provided sleeper beds to hospitals to allow families to stay together through treatment and countless other ways {{to make a difference in}} some of Australia's most vulnerable lives.|$|E
50|$|The most {{significant}} two <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exponent {{are limited to}} <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> 0−2, and <b>the</b> {{most significant}} 4 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> significand are limited to <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> 0−9. <b>The</b> 30 possible combinations are encoded in a 5-bit field, along with special forms for infinity and NaN.|$|R
50|$|In both cases, {{the most}} {{significant}} 4 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> significand (which actually only have 10 possible values) are combined with {{the most significant}} 2 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exponent (3 possible values) to use 30 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 32 possible values of a 5-bit field. The remaining combinations encode infinities and NaNs.|$|R
5000|$|All {{continuation}} bytes contain exactly six bits {{from the}} code point. So <b>the</b> next six <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> code point {{are stored in}} the low order six <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next byte, and [...] is stored in the high order two bits to mark it as a continuation byte (so [...] ).|$|R
25|$|The Alpha {{does not}} have {{condition}} codes for integer instructions to remove a potential bottleneck at the condition status register. Instructions resulting in an overflow, such as adding two numbers whose result does not fit in 64 bits, write the 32 or 64 least significant bits to the destination register. The carry is generated by performing an unsigned compare on the result with either operand {{to see if the}} result is smaller than either operand. If the test was true, the value one is written to the least significant <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> destination register to indicate the condition.|$|E
25|$|In Simple Electromagnetic Analysis (SEMA) attacks, the {{attacker}} deduces the key directly by observing the trace. It is very effective against asymmetric cryptography implementations. Typically, {{only a few}} traces are needed, though {{the attacker}} {{needs to have a}} strong understanding of the cryptographic device and of the implementation of the cryptographic algorithm. An implementation vulnerable to SEMA attacks will perform a different operation depending on whether the <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key is 0 or 1, which will use different amounts of power and/or different chip components. This method is prevalent in many different types of side-channel attacks, in particular, power analysis attacks. Thus, the attacker can observe the entire computation of encryption and can deduce the key.|$|E
25|$|Miller, in one {{spirited}} over, {{altered the}} whole {{course of the}} game. With the third ball of that eventful over he trapped Hutton with his legs {{in front of the}} wicket trying to defend against an inswinger which moved in late. The value of Miller's bowling lies wholly and solely in its surprise element. Just when he appears to be well {{under the control of the}} batsman he comes to light with a ball that can upset anyone...with the sixth ball of the over Compton played-on before he had opened his score. The seventh and eighth balls did everything else but put paid to Parkhouse's account. Miller deserved every <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thunderous applause which the big crowd handed him when the over was completed.|$|E
50|$|R is now <b>the</b> first r <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output.|$|R
2500|$|All {{continuation}} bytes contain exactly six bits {{from the}} code point. [...] So <b>the</b> next six <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> code point {{are stored in}} the low order six <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next byte, and 10 is stored in the high order two bits to mark it as a continuation byte (so 10).|$|R
5000|$|Dn = En−1 XOR P. Exclusive-OR En−1 with P {{to create}} Dn. For <b>the</b> first M <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> block, this is {{equivalent}} to CBC mode; <b>the</b> first M <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous block's ciphertext, En−1,are XORed with <b>the</b> M <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> plaintext <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last plaintext block. <b>The</b> zero padding <b>of</b> P in step 4 was important, because it makes the XOR operation's effect on the last B−M bits equivalent to copying <b>the</b> last B−M <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> En−1 to <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> Dn. These are the same bits that were stripped off of En−1 in step 3 when Cn was created.|$|R
