5|$|During {{the late}} Middle Kingdom, greater {{standardization}} of the epistolary formula can be seen, {{for example in}} a series of model letters taken from dispatches sent to the Semna fortress of Nubia during the reign of Amenemhat III (r. 1860–1814 BC). Epistles were also written during all three dynasties of the New Kingdom. While letters to the dead had been written since the Old Kingdom, the writing of petition letters in epistolary form to deities began in the Ramesside Period, <b>becoming</b> <b>very</b> popular during the Persian and Ptolemaic periods.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Gilda in 1973 was {{the first}} {{documented}} tropical cyclone on record to transition into a subtropical cyclone. It formed on October16 in the western Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave, and strengthened to reach peak winds of 70mph (110km/h) before striking Cuba. It later moved slowly through the Bahamas before weakening to tropical depression status. On October24, {{with the assistance of}} a cold front off the coast of the eastern United States, Gilda transformed into a subtropical storm, <b>becoming</b> <b>very</b> large and strong. The storm later accelerated northeastward and became extratropical, ultimately dissipating near Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Common {{over much}} of the Northern Hemisphere, S.coccinea occurs in the Midwest, in the valleys between the Pacific coast, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascade Range. Its North American {{distribution}} extends north to various locations in Canada and south to the Mexican state Jalisco. The fungus has also been collected from Chile in South America. It is also found in the Old World—Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and India. Specimens collected from the Macaronesian islands that once thought to be S.coccinea were later determined to be the distinct species S.macaronesica. A 1995 study of the occurrence of British Sarcoscypha (including S.coccinea and S.austriaca) concluded that S.coccinea was <b>becoming</b> <b>very</b> rare in Great Britain. All species of Sarcoscypha, including S.coccinea, are Red-Listed in Europe. In Turkey, it is considered critically endangered.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} promotion, Curtis joined the small brig HMS Otter in Newfoundland and there {{spent several years}} {{operating}} off the Labrador coastline, <b>becoming</b> <b>very</b> familiar with the local geography and the Inuit peoples of the region. In a report he wrote for Lord Dartmouth, Curtis opined that although the inland regions of Labrador were barren, the coast was an ideal place for a seasonal cod fishery. He also formed a good opinion of the native people, applauding their healthy and peaceful lifestyle. Curtis made numerous exploratory voyages along the Labrador coast and formed close links with the Inuit tribes and Moravian missionaries in the region. His notes and despatches were presented to the Royal Academy by Daines Barrington in 1774, although accusations later surfaced {{that many of his}} observations were plagiarised from the notes of a local officer, Captain George Cartwright.|$|E
5|$|The A had {{authority}} for a southern extension to Rickmansworth, connecting with the LNWR's Watford and Rickmansworth Railway. Following discussions between the Duke and Watkin {{it was agreed}} that this line would be extended south to meet the Met at Harrow and permission for this extension was granted in 1874 and Watkin joined the board of the A in 1875. Money was not found for this scheme and the Met had to return to Parliament in 1880 and 1881 to obtain permission for a railway from Harrow to Aylesbury. Pinner was reached in 1885 and an hourly service from Rickmansworth and Northwood to Baker Street started on 1 September 1887. By then raising money was <b>becoming</b> <b>very</b> difficult although there was local support for a station at Chesham. Authorised in 1885, double track from Rickmansworth was laid for , then single to Chesham. Services to Chesham calling at Chorley Wood and Chalfont Road (now Chalfont & Latimer) started on 8 July 1889.|$|E
5|$|The Australians played three Tests in England in 1896, but Peel only {{played in}} the final one. Before the match, several English professionals—not {{including}} Peel—threatened to strike, but the dispute was settled. Then, before {{the third day of}} the game, the pitch was mysteriously watered, <b>becoming</b> <b>very</b> difficult for batting. Australia only needed a small total, but Peel believed that he could bowl them out. He took six of the last seven Australian wickets at a cost of 23 runs to bowl England to victory; in recognition of this achievement, Stanley Jackson, a teammate in this game, gave him a gold watch-chain ornament. He was less successful with the bat, scoring a pair once again. This was his final Test match. In total, Peel played 20 Tests, scoring 427 runs at an average of 14.72 and taking 101 wickets at 16.98.|$|E

5|$|St Mary's Church, Reculver, {{was founded}} in the 7th century as either a minster or a monastery {{on the site of}} a Roman fort at Reculver, which was then at the {{north-eastern}} extremity of Kent in south-eastern England. In 669, the site of the fort was given for this purpose by King Ecgberht of Kent to a priest named Bassa, beginning a connection with Kentish kings that led to King Eadberht II of Kent being buried there in the 760s, and the church <b>becoming</b> <b>very</b> wealthy {{by the beginning of the}} 9th century. From the early 9th century to the 10th the church was treated as essentially a piece of property, with ownership passing between kings of Mercia and Wessex and the archbishops of Canterbury. Viking attacks may have extinguished the church's religious community in the 9th century, although an early 11th-century record indicates that the church was then in the hands of a dean accompanied by monks. By the time of Domesday Book, completed in 1086, St Mary's was serving as a parish church.|$|E

25|$|The 1980s and 1990s {{were marked}} by {{the search for a}} new musical {{discourse}} in urban popular music, the increase, commodification and industrialization of musical production, and the mediatization and expansion of music consumption. The boom in Portuguese musical production was accompanied by both the diversification of the musical domains and styles produced and consumed in Portugal and the emergence of new styles which are increasingly taking the global market into account.
