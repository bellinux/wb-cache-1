The studied apple varieties were developed by breeder E. N. Sedov and cytological analysis was carried out by cytologist G. A. Sedysheva. In early winter, all cultivars exhibited high tolerance to cold. In mid-winter <b>buds</b> and <b>wood</b> were severely damaged, while bark was more resistant for most cultivars. Basic components of hardiness were estimated: component I - frost resistance at - 25 °C in the beginning of winter; component II - maximum value of frost resistance at - 40 °C developed by plants during hardening; component III - ability to retain the hardened condition at - 25 °C after a period of three-day thaw at + 2 °C; and component IV - the ability to restore frost resistance at - 30 °C after repeated hardening and three-day thaw at + 2 °C. During late-winter thaws, buds suffered from frosts, while the bark and wood retained frost hardiness. Late in winter all cultivars demonstrated high resistance to repeated frosts. Triploid cultivars exhibited the highest level of cold hardiness of vegetative <b>buds,</b> bark and <b>wood</b> of annual shoots throughout the winter; these cultivars included ‘Zhilinskoye’, ‘Vavilovskoye’, ‘Osipovskoye’, ‘Patriot’, ‘Sinap Orlovski’, ‘Spasskoye’, ‘Turgenevskoye’, and diploids ‘Bolotovskoye’, ‘Sokovinka’, and ‘’Ranneye Aloye’...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of dwarfed rootstocks in apple crop {{has led to}} a new concept of intensive planting systems with the aim of producing early high yield and with returns of the initial high investment. Although yield is an important aspect to the grower, the consumer has become demanding regards fruit quality and is generally attracted by appearance. To fulfil the consumer’s expectations the grower may need to choose a proper training system along with an ideal pruning technique, which ensure a good light distribution {{in different parts of the}} canopy and a marketable fruit quality in terms of size and skin colour. Although these aspects are important, these fruits might not reach the proper ripening stage within the canopy because they are often heterogeneous. To describe the variability present in a tree, a software (PlantToon®), was used to recreate the tree architecture in 3 D in the two training systems. The ripening stage of each of the fruits was determined using a non-destructive device (DA-Meter), thus allowing to estimate the fruit ripening variability. This study deals with some of the main parameters that can influence fruit quality and ripening stage within the canopy and orchard management techniques that can ameliorate a ripening fruit homogeneity. Significant differences in fruit quality were found within the canopies due to their position, flowering time and <b>bud</b> <b>wood</b> age. Bi-axis appeared to be suitable for high density planting, even though the fruit quality traits resulted often similar to those obtained with a Slender Spindle, suggesting similar fruit light availability within the canopies. Crop load confirmed to be an important factor that influenced fruit quality as much as the interesting innovative pruning method “Click”, in intensive planting systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{possible}} {{relationship of}} branching habit to cytokinin content of apple shoots (Malusxdomestica Borkh.) was investigated. One-year old apple shoots are acrotonic (distal branching), more strongly so in Granny Smith than in Braeburn. In the first trial, long, 1 -year old Granny Smith and Braeburn apple shoots were sprayed on 29 August 1995 to break rest with dinitro-o-cresol (DNOC) oil (5 %). The cytokinin {{contents of the}} xylem sap, the combined bark and <b>buds,</b> and the <b>wood</b> were determined in distal and proximal shoot halves over the next 6 weeks. Budburst (terminal and lateral buds) was first visible (green tip) in both cultivars on 20 September 1995. A greater increase in cytokinin content of distal xylem sap, coupled with elevated cytokinin in the distal wood, reflect the overall acrotony of both cultivars. The strong acrotony of Granny Smith {{is reflected in the}} higher cytokinin concentration in distal portion 1 week before the proximal portion of the shoot. The differential distribution of cytokinin reflects the pattern of budburst and may be correlated with growth habit. In a subsequent trial, Granny Smith shoots chilled and forced in the absence of roots showed an increase in cytokinin content of the bark and <b>buds,</b> and the <b>wood</b> as growth resumed. This was roughly comparable in magnitude to the increase observed under field conditions. The cytokinin increase in rootless shoots and differential distribution of cytokinin prior to sprouting, support the hypothesis that shoot-derived, rather than root-derived, cytokinins act to trigger spring budburst. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

She had {{her brother}} again, as wholly hers as in their younger days,--depending upon her, {{participating}} {{in all her}} pleasures, or rather giving her favourite occupations double zest, by their being for him, for his amusement. She rode and walked in the beautiful open spring country with grandpapa, to whom she was a most valuable companion; and on her return she had two to visit, both of whom looked forward with keen interest and delight to hearing her histories of down and wood, of field and valley, of farm-house, cottage, or school; had a laugh for the least amusing circumstance, admiration for the spring flower or leaf, and power to follow her descriptions of <b>budding</b> <b>woods,</b> soft rising hills, and gorgeous sunsets. How her mamma enjoyed comparing notes with her about those same woods and dells, and would describe the adventures of her own youth! And now it might be noticed {{that she did not}} avoid speaking of those in which Henrietta's father had been engaged; nay, she dwelt on them by preference, and without the suppressed sigh which had formerly followed anything like a reference to him. Sometimes she would smile to identify the bold open down with the same where she had run races with him, and even laugh to think of the droll adventures. Sometimes the shady woodland walk would make her describe their nutting parties, or it would bring her thoughts to some fit of childish mischief and concealment, and to the confession to which his bolder and more upright counsel had at length led her. Or she would tell of the long walks they had taken together when older grown, when each had become prime counsellor and confidante of the other; and the interests and troubles of home and of school were poured out to willing ears, and sympathy and advice exchanged. How Fred and Mary had been companions from the very first, how their love had grown up unconsciously, in the sports in the sunny fields, shady coombs, and green woods of their home: how it had strengthened and ripened with advancing years, and how bright and unclouded their sunshine had been to dwell on: this was her delight, while the sadness which once spoke of crushed hopes, and lost happiness, had gone from her smile. It was as if she still felt herself walking in the light of his love, and at the same time, as if she wished to show him to his daughter as he was, and to tell Henrietta of those words and those ways of his which were most characteristic, and which used to be laid up so fast in her heart, that she could never have borne to speak of them. The bitterness of his death, as it regarded herself, seemed to have passed, the brightness of his memory alone remaining. Henrietta loved to listen, but scarcely so much as her mother loved to tell; and instead of agitating her, these recollections always seemed to soothe and make her happy.|$|R

40|$|Effective crop load {{management}} in orchards {{is a requirement}} for accurate crop yield estimation.

While optical approaches to automated fruit counting have been proposed they are usually not robust to changing light conditions or colour and shape changes of the fruit during the growing season. We are currently developing an automated yield estimation system that optically estimates crop yield in orchards during various stages of growth. Instead of using traditional machine vision and image processing algorithms we build on recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNN) to build an object detector that extracts regions from the image that represent a fruit.

Ash species were introduced into New Zealand upon colonization in the 1800 s. Recently, ash trees throughout Europe have been observed to become damaged or die due to a severe disease known as ash dieback, caused by the fungus Chalara fraxinea.

This is particularly important to animals that invest heavily in nest construction, such as social insects. Many ant species have a polydomous nesting strategy: a single colony inhabits several spatially separated nests, often exchanging resources between the nests. Different nests in a polydomous colony potentially have differential access {{to resources}}, but the ecological consequences of this are unclear. In this study, we investigate how nest survival and <b>budding</b> in polydomous <b>wood</b> ant (Formica lugubris) colonies are affected by {{being part of a}} multi-nest system. Using field data and novel analytical approaches combining survival models with dynamic network analysis, we show that the survival and budding of nests within a polydomous colony is affected by their position in the nest-network structure. Specifically, we find that the flow of resources through a nest, which is based on its position within the wider nest-network, determines a nest’s likelihood of surviving, and of founding new nests. Our results highlight how apparently disparate entities in a biological system can be integrated into a functional ecological unit. We also demonstrate how position within a dynamic network structure can have important ecological consequences...|$|R

Dormancy was not induced by pruning the root system of actively growing alder seedlings or by the treatment of isolated growing shoots with 10 - 4 M ABA. ABA prolonged the dormancy of apparently dormant buds after their transfer to an environment favouring growth, but this effect was modified by species, time of year, presence and absence of leaves, and position of the bud on the stem. C 8 and C 9 prolonged the dormancy of Populus nigra Italica while C 10 promoted bud burst in Salix alba/babylonica. CCC was ineffective in most species tested (Alnus, Populus and Salix) except when in combination with ABA. The use of aseptic shoots of Populus yunnanensis cultured in vitro as a bioassay for dormancy-inducing substances was found to be limited by the variable growth responses elicited. No dormancy-inducing substances were detected in extracts, including the inhibitor β fraction, of dormant buds or leaves or shoots. The presence of various concentrations of ABA, C 5, C 10, AMO 1618 and ABA + AMO 1618 in the medium did not cause the formation of dormant shoot morphology, although growth was inhibited by certain treatments. Results are discussed in relation to the inhibitor hypothesis of dormancy regulation...|$|R
