500|$|The United States was {{represented}} by Mark R. Freeman, Assistant to the Solicitor General. [...] Freeman argued that Congress had placed a cap on IDEAA contract funds beginning in 1994, and the BIA {{did not have the}} authority to spend more than the capped amount on all of the IDEAA contracts. [...] Due to the lack of sufficient funding, the Secretary of the Interior has distributed the available funds on a pro rata basis among all of the IDEAA contracts. [...] The United States also pointed out that the Constitution prohibits payments unless those payments have been appropriated or authorized by Congress. [...] Freeman argued that the government's liability does not extend past {{the amount of money that}} Congress has appropriated for all of the contracts. [...] The government also stated that the contract did not create a <b>binding</b> <b>promise</b> to pay the tribes the full amount of the contract.|$|E

40|$|We study a {{model in}} which {{politicians}} differ {{in their ability to}} im- plement some policy. In an election, candidates make <b>binding</b> <b>promises</b> regarding the plans they will implement. These serve as a signal of true ability. In equilibrium, candidates make overambitious promises. The candidate with the highest ability wins. Yet, the electorate may be better off having a random candidate implement her best plan, rather than seeing the election winner implementing an overambitious plan. This is more likely if the distribution of abilities is skewed toward high values, in the case of private benefits from being elected, or if parties select candidates...|$|R
50|$|In law, an {{affirmation}} is a solemn declaration allowed {{to those who}} conscientiously object to taking an oath. An affirmation has exactly the same legal effect as an oath but is usually taken to avoid the religious implications of an oath; it is thus legally binding but not considered a religious oath. Some religious minorities hold beliefs {{that allow them to}} make legally <b>binding</b> <b>promises</b> but forbid them to swear an oath before God. Additionally, many decline to make a religious oath because they feel that to do so would be valueless or even inappropriate, especially in secular courts. In some jurisdictions, {{an affirmation}} may be given only if such a reason is provided.|$|R

Provis was to be {{strictly}} careful while I was gone, and Herbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken. I was to be absent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be begun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to Herbert also, that he might be best got away across the water, on that pretence,--as, to make purchases, or the like.|$|E
40|$|Focusing on the {{interaction}} of law and emotions, this Article unfolds in three parts. Part I illuminates {{the connection between the}} affective background of donative promises and their modem unenforceability. It hypothesizes that rejecting promises that are not supported by consideration can be seen as an effort to distance law from any association with irrational decisionmaking and to disassociate it from 2 ̆ 2 emotional 2 ̆ 2 spheres. Part II seeks to correct the erroneous way affective giving has been perceived by law in the gifts context. The law must carefully analyze each relevant emotion concretely and separately, rather than treating emotion as an undifferentiated aggregate. This part is dedicated to an interdisciplinary investigation of the leading emotions that {{play a role in the}} context of gifts and altruistic behavior: empathy and gratitude. Part III integrates the knowledge gained in Part II with the normative question of the desirable rule for donative promises. It suggests that given the special function of empathy and gratitude in the gift setting, the main justifications for the enforcement of bargained-for promises support the enforcement of donative promises. Part III concludes with the suggestion that enforcement should not be dependent on the motives that led to promising and instead would depend on the intention of promisors to be legally bound by their promises. It is suggested that the freedom to make legally <b>binding</b> <b>promises</b> would be afforded to players in all spheres of life and less biased toward profit-seeking activities. The Article ends with a concrete suggestion to move from total refusal to enforce donative promises to a cautious willingness to enforce them 2 ̆ 2 consciously 2 ̆ 2 : only in cases of provable intention to create legally <b>binding</b> <b>promises...</b>|$|R

40|$|Every sale or lease of a {{computer}} program involves a number of legally <b>binding</b> <b>promises</b> {{that a number of}} factual conditions are true. If these promises, legally called warranties, are not true, and you do not get what you see, then you may be entitled to certain damages. Sellers, knowing about their liability for such damages, try to minimize their exposure to them. They do this by trying to deny the availability of the warranties with disclaimers and by attempting to condition and limit any damages for which they might be held responsible. Whether you can make sure that {{what you see is what}} the seller gives you depends upon many factors. These factors include whether the software is for business or personal use, whether it is packaged or customized, the type of damage you suffered, whether the promise or warranty was implied or was express, and whether the seller has made a proper disclaimer or limitation of damage...|$|R

50|$|A {{few days}} later, Kelson, Conall, and Dhugal are all knighted. During the ceremony, Duncan {{publicly}} reveals {{that he is}} Deryni, an act which causes {{a great deal of}} consternation among his fellow bishops. Afterwards, Kelson confesses his growing affection for Princess Rothana of Nur Hallaj, a Deryni religious novice who admits that her love for the king is causing her to doubt her vocation. Although the two make no <b>binding</b> <b>promises,</b> they agree to pursue a deeper commitment when Kelson returns from his summer quest. Their conversation is observed by Conall, whose own attraction for Rothana further fuels his jealousy toward his royal cousin. Conall meets with Tiercel again, but an argument between teacher and pupil results in tragedy when an angry Conall shoves Tiercel down a flight of stairs, breaking his neck and killing him instantly. Conall pilfers a satchel of drugs from Tiercel's corpse, probes the dead man's mind for additional arcane knowledge, then leaves the body hidden deep within the walls of Rhemuth castle.|$|R

5000|$|The {{advantage}} of the abbreviated term sheet format is, first, that it expedites the process. Experienced counsel immediately know generally what is meant when the term sheet specifies [...] "one demand registration at the issuer's expense, unlimited piggybacks at the issuer's expense, weighted average antidilution"; it saves time {{not to have to}} spell out the long-form edition of those references. Second, since the term sheet does not propose to be an agreement of any sort, it is less likely that a court will find unexpected promissory content; a [...] "letter of intent" [...] can be a dangerous document unless it specifies very clearly, as it should, which portions are meant to be binding and which merely guide the discussion and drafting. Some portions of a term sheet can have binding effect, of course, if and to the extent an interlocutory memorialization is needed of some <b>binding</b> <b>promises,</b> that is, confidentiality of the disclosures made in the negotiation. The summary format of a term sheet, however, makes it less likely that any party will be misled into thinking that some form of enforceable agreement has been memorialized when it has not.|$|R

Any indentured laborer who left before the contract ended was considered a criminal and subject to a prison term.|$|E
50|$|The title-transfer {{theory of}} {{contract}} (TTToC) {{is a legal}} interpretation of contracts developed by economist Murray Rothbard and jurist Williamson Evers.

40|$|Experience is complex. The job {{of theory}} is to simplify and unify, to {{abstract}} from the blooming, buzzing confusion {{and find some}} basic rules we can use to guide us through it. Contract theory is a prime example. Theorists treat legally <b>binding</b> <b>promises</b> as elemental speech acts, utterances that accomplish one thing: put the promisor under an obligation to perform. This simplification has allowed contract theory {{to focus on the}} deep questions that follow: When do speech acts create such an obligation? How should we interpret the scope of the duty undertaken? What should be the legal consequences of its violation? These basic questions, along with a few others, have given rise to volumes of thought on how legal liability should be structured. But abstraction has its costs. In the case of contract theory, the costs have included a tendency to ignore other aspects of the act of promising. Most notably, theorists have by and large ignored the fact that, in everyday use, a promise is often understood also to say something about the promisor 2 ̆ 7 s state of mind—namely, that she intends to do the act promised. This representation, like any other, might be true or false, and, if false, the promisor might be held liable for fraud...|$|R
50|$|Rosenberg {{stated that}} the primary German {{objective}} in the region was to attain unlimited access to the oil supplies of Maikop and Groznyi. While Hitler agreed with this assessment, he rejected the proposals {{for the establishment of}} a loosely controlled confederacy in the Caucasus. Instead he believed that the region, with its history of mutually warring states and peoples would have to be subjected to a very rigid type of control. While determining that the Caucasus had to be severed from Russia in any scenario, he did not however decide or had any established notions whether the Caucasus would have to be annexed to Germany or not, nor what form the German administration should ultimately take. Proposals pertaining to autonomy for the Caucasus nationalities were better received from the army than from Rosenberg, to which Hitler only demanded that specific promises of national independence be deleted from any official army proclamations so as not to make any <b>binding</b> <b>promises.</b> At the request of the army, Hitler authorized the German forces to give individual ethnic groups of the Caucasus measure of self-administration still short of national independence in a Führer order dated 8 September 1942, as Rosenberg had also proposed. The troops were instructed to treat the native people as friends, and forced labour was only to be recruited from Russians and Ukrainians.|$|R

40|$|Wa 2 ̆ 7 d (the {{unilateral}} promise) is {{an alternative}} for separate multi contract in one transaction and ribâ that are prohibited with Islamic law. The application of this promise faces difficulty because of difference of principle between unilateral promise that is not binding and the business practice that based on rule of law. The fatwa of DSN, in one side, use both unilateral promise (wa 2 ̆ 7 d) and bilateral promise (muwâ 2 ̆ 7 adah), and other side, consider such as binding in case and not binding in other case. This indicates the difficulty for applying wa 2 ̆ 7 d at the modern contract. Fatwa of DSN has tendency on <b>binding</b> the <b>promise,</b> especially uni-lateral promise.

40|$|Resistance to {{socially}} desired reforms {{may arise}} from uncertainty {{about the consequences of}} reforms at the individual level (Fernandez and Rodrik, 1991). Without a <b>binding</b> commitment, a <b>promise</b> to compensate losers will not raise support for reforms due to a credibility problem. This paper shows that voting simultaneously on several reforms may solve the credibility problem. It is argued that the governmental agreement in the Netherlands has served as a means to vote simultaneously on several reforms and has helped breaking political deadlocks. Moreover, our model provides an explanation for some perceived changes in the Dutch policy making process. ...|$|R
50|$|Denning LJ {{said the}} term could only {{possibly}} be a warranty, whose ordinary meaning is ‘to denote a binding promise’. In Cross v Gardner Holt CJ held that ‘An affirmation {{at the time}} of a sale is a warranty, provided it appears on evidence to be so intended.’ And this was the ordinary English meaning of a <b>binding</b> <b>promise.</b> But in Heilbut, Symons & Co v Buckleton Lord Haldane LC and Lord Moulton said ‘warranty’ in a technical sense, distinguished from a condition. The crucial point of this case was not whether the representation was a warranty or condition, but a term of the contract at all. It followed that Williams’ statement was a mere representation.|$|E

When the suitor was chosen for the daughter, the suitor and the father would proceed in a process known as engysis, (‘giving of a pledge into the hand’), which is where the two men would shake hands and say some ritual phrases. The woman did not decide whom she would marry, only under very special circumstances, and she played no active role in the engysis process, which was not out of the norm for that time period. After the engysis, the two would make a <b>binding</b> <b>promise,</b> which occurred before the marriage.|$|E

40|$|We {{initiate}} {{examination of}} the political boundaries of the firm by exploring the phenomenon of ‘businessman candidates’: business owners and managers who bypass conventional means of political influence to run for public office themselves. We argue that in-house production of political influence {{will be more likely}} in institutional environments where candidates find it difficult to make <b>binding</b> campaign <b>promises.</b> When campaign <b>promises</b> are <b>binding,</b> then a businessman may always pay a professional politician to run on the platform that political competition would otherwise compel the businessman to adopt. In contrast, when commitment to a campaign platform is impossible, then candidate identity matters for the policies that will be adopted ex post, implying that a businessman may choose to run for office if the stakes are sufficiently large. We illustrate our arguments through discussion of gubernatorial elections in postcommunist Russia, where businessmen frequently run for public office, institutions to encourage elected officials to keep their campaign promises are weak, and competition for rents is intense. businessman candidates; citizen candidates; elections; institutions; political economy...|$|R
