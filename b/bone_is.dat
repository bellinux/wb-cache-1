5|$|At the back, the nasals are {{separated}} by the frontal in K. langenbergensis, the back third of which is somewhat vaulted. The portion of the frontal between the eyes is one-third {{the width of the}} entire skull in both species, but it widens further back to form the front of the skull roof. The prefrontal is straight along its contact with the frontal and nasal (about half of the <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> in contact with each), but forms an angle between the margin of the eye socket and the lacrimal on the other side. This angle is rounded in K. guimarotae such that the <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> oval-shaped, but very pointed in K. langenbergensis such that the <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> triangular.|$|E
5|$|On {{the bottom}} of the skull, the pterygoid is about twice as wide as it is long. At the front of the pterygoid is a small {{projection}} that extends backwards to form a ridge, on either side of which is a furrow-like depression (the choanal groove) containing the choanae. In Theriosuchus, unlike Knoetschkesuchus, the choanae are embedded in a wider bowl-like depression. Additionally, in both species, the bottom surface of the pterygoid is somewhat concave. Extending forward from either side of the pterygoid is the ectopterygoid; in both species, this <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> constricted near the middle to form an hourglass-like shape, but in K. langenbergensis it is also somewhat twisted to the side. The back of the <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> very concave in both species.|$|E
5|$|Pterosaurs' hip sockets are {{oriented}} facing slightly upwards, and {{the head}} of the femur (thigh <b>bone)</b> <b>is</b> only moderately inward facing, suggesting that pterosaurs had an erect stance. It would have been possible to lift the thigh into a horizontal position during flight, as gliding lizards do.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally {{accessory}} <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> {{found in}} the carpus, but of more than 20 such described bones, only four (the central, styloid, secondary trapezoid, and secondary pisiform <b>bones)</b> <b>are</b> considered to <b>be</b> proven accessory <b>bones.</b> Sometimes the scaphoid, triquetrum, and pisiform <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> divided into two.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the effect of preconditioning on bone breaking strength. Fresh, frozen, and oven dried <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> compared. Since the left and right tibias from chickens have a correlation coefficient of. 90 or greater for breaking strength of fresh bones, tagged paired <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> used. One <b>bone</b> <b>was</b> broken at one treatment and the other <b>bone</b> <b>was</b> broken at the other treatment, so each pair represented two of the three treatments and all possible combinations of treatments were compared. Only minor differences in strength between fresh and frozen were detected when fresh <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> used, but drying bones decreased their strength approximately 50 %. Male and female <b>bone</b> strength <b>were</b> the same after drying but significantly different before drying, so consideration must be given to the way <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> handled prior to testing...|$|R

5|$|The {{alveolar}} <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> {{the bone}} of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth. Like any other bone {{in the human}} body, alveolar <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{flattened}} {{in general}} shape. The front part {{is short and}} broad. The broad interorbital region (located between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped, with squared edges and weakly developed beading. A postorbital ridge is present, obscuring the suture (joint) between the frontal and squamosal bones, a feature shared only with Holochilus among oryzomyines. The braincase is squarish. The interparietal <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> wide, but does not reach the squamosals on the sides. The zygomatic arches, which are well-developed, are furthest apart at the back and converge toward the front. The jugal <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> small.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, {{a band of}} full, plump gingiva {{is needed}} {{to fill in the}} space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue {{complication}} is called a black-triangle, where the papilla (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> any greater.|$|E
50|$|Long <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{larger in}} males than in females {{within a given}} population. Muscle attachment sites on long <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> often more robust in males than in females, reflecting a difference in overall muscle mass and development between sexes. Sexual dimorphism in the long <b>bones</b> <b>is</b> commonly characterized by morphometric or gross morphological analyses.|$|R

5|$|English syntax {{relies on}} {{auxiliary}} verbs for many functions including {{the expression of}} tense, aspect and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> the complement of the negated verb did not. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.|$|E
5|$|Gravity <b>Bone</b> <b>is</b> a first-person {{adventure}} {{video game}} that lasts around 20 minutes, and {{is set in}} the fictional city of Nuevos Aires. The player controls an unnamed spy, and is tasked with accomplishing several missions across the game's two stages. At the end of the game, the player-controlled spy is killed by an unknown woman after chasing her through {{the last half of the}} second level. The game was designed to leave the player without a clear idea of how the game's story evolves.|$|E
5|$|Gravity <b>Bone</b> <b>is</b> a {{freeware}} first-person adventure {{video game}} developed by Blendo Games, and released on August 28, 2008. The game employs {{a modified version}} of id Software's id Tech 2 engine—originally used for Quake 2—and incorporates music from films by director Wong Kar-wai, which were originally performed by Xavier Cugat. Four incarnations of the game were produced during its one-year development; the first featured more common first-person shooter elements than the released version. Subsequent versions shifted in a new direction, with the inclusion of more spy-oriented gameplay.|$|E
30|$|Chicken bone powder (40 – 60 mesh): {{the meat}} residue, fat, and {{connective}} tissue on fresh <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> removed after cleaning with clear water. The <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> soaked with gasoline {{for a period}} of time, then the grease was taken out by extraction solvent. The treated <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> washed again and dried.

50|$|In May 1941, a human {{skull and}} some <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> discovered. On 21 May, the find was {{reported}} to the Fyns Stiftsmuseum. The museum staff were able to reconstruct the original position of the bones only because the blocks of peat containing the <b>bones</b> could <b>be</b> matched to the holes where they {{were removed from the}} bog. The skull and two <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> found at a depth of 2.5 m, but the majority of the <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> found in a depth of 3 to 3.5 m, at a distance of 7 to 8 m from the other bones.

5|$|Hypogeomys australis is an extinct rodent {{from central}} and southeastern Madagascar. First {{described}} in 1903, it {{is larger than}} its close relative, the living Hypogeomys antimena, which occurs further west, but otherwise similar. Average length of the femur (upper leg <b>bone)</b> <b>is</b> 72.1mm, compared to 63.8mm in H.antimena. One of the few extinct rodents of Madagascar, it survived to at least around 1536 BP based on radiocarbon dating. Little is known of its ecology, but it may have lived in burrows like its living relative and eaten some arid-adapted plants.|$|E
5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} supply to the epiphyseal <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E
5|$|In the mandible, the {{diastema}} (gap) {{between the}} incisors and the cheekteeth (premolars and molars) is relatively deep. The mental foramen (an {{opening in the}} <b>bone)</b> <b>is</b> located relatively high and before the p4. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which are located on the outer side of the jaw and anchor some of the chewing muscles, meet at the m1. The surfaces of the incisor are very flat, but there are small, irregular striations in the enamel {{along the length of}} the tooth.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, {{pterosaur}} <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> {{discovered in}} Xinjiang by Chris Sloan. The <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> first identified {{as those of}} a theropod; palaeontologist James Clark later recognized their pterosaurian nature.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> {{removed and}} {{examined}} in 1933, by the archivist of Westminster Abbey, Lawrence Tanner; a leading anatomist, Professor William Wright; {{and the president}} of the Dental Association, George Northcroft. By measuring certain bones and teeth, they concluded the bones belonged to two children around the correct ages for the princes. The <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> found to have been interred carelessly along with chicken and other animal <b>bones.</b> There <b>were</b> also three very rusty nails. One skeleton was larger than the other, but many of the <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> missing, including part of the smaller jawbone and all of the teeth from the larger one. Many of the <b>bones</b> had <b>been</b> broken by the original workmen. The examination has been criticised, on the grounds that it was conducted under the presumption that the <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> those of the princes and concentrated only on whether the bones showed evidence of suffocation. Thus no attempt was even made to determine whether the <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> male or female.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s William Royal and other scuba divers found {{artifacts}} and human bones {{from at least}} seven individuals in Warm Mineral Springs. A partially burned log found in association {{with some of the}} human <b>bones</b> <b>was</b> radiocarbon dated to about 10,000 years ago. If the <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> the same age as the log, then the <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> the oldest known evidence of human occupation in Florida at the time. Bone artifacts recovered in association with the human <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> described as of [...] "Archaic period in the Americas-type".

5|$|Like rauisuchians, Batrachotomus {{walked with}} an erect posture, {{although}} the limbs were not located {{directly under the}} trunk. The limbs were not equal in length as the forelimbs were about 70% of the hindlimbs. The toe bones (phalanges) are poorly preserved and the only well known <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> a fifth metatarsal (bone in hindlimbs attached to the toe bones) which was hooked in shape. However, hypotheses suggest that probably each forelimb had four toes and each hindlimb five.|$|E
5|$|Oral trauma, {{including}} {{recession of}} gingival tissue and dental fracture and wear. Recession of gingival tissue affects 19% to 68% of subjects with lip and/or intra-oral ornaments. In some cases, the alveolar tooth-bearing <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> also involved, jeopardizing {{the stability and}} durability of the teeth in place and requiring a periodontal regeneration surgery. Dental fracture and wear affects 14% to 41% of subjects with lip and/or intra-oral ornaments.|$|E

5000|$|Sesamoid <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> <b>bones</b> {{embedded}} in tendons. Since they act {{to hold the}} tendon further away from the joint, {{the angle of the}} tendon is increased and thus the leverage of the muscle is increased. Examples of sesamoid <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> the patella and the pisiform.|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the altar}} there <b>are</b> four rib <b>bones,</b> hanging from wires. The <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> more than 1 metre long.

5|$|The {{front part}} of the skull is notably broad. As in Holochilus, the {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front portion of the cheek <b>bone,</b> <b>is</b> expansive and produced into a spinous process at the anterior margin. The jugal <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> small, but less reduced than in Holochilus. The interorbital region of the skull is narrow and flanked by high beads. The incisive foramina, which perforate the palate between the incisors and the upper molars, are long, extending between the molars. The palate itself is also long, extending beyond the posterior margin of the maxillary bones, and it is perforated near the third molars by conspicuous posterolateral palatal pits. As in all oryzomyines, the squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, {{the roof of the}} tympanic cavity, but Lundomys is unusual in that the squamosal and the tegmen tympani usually overlap when viewed from the side. In the mandible, the angular and coronoid processes are less well-developed than in Holochilus. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, near the coronoid process, is small. The two masseteric ridges, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their anterior edges, which are located below the first molar.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) is less robust than in T.bolivaris. The coronoid process (a {{process in}} the back part of the <b>bone)</b> <b>is</b> small and the capsular process, which houses {{the root of the}} lower incisor, are small. The mental foramen, located in the diastema between the lower incisor and the first molar, opens towards the side, as usual in oryzomyines. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, do not join into a single crest and extend forward to below the first molar.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{somewhat}} {{smaller than that}} of N.matroka and the braincase and palate are narrower. Compared to N.somalica, the skull is broader. The ridge on the lacrimal <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> better developed, the palate is broader, the frontal bones contain a depression and are swollen at the sides, the mastoid bones are smaller, and the coronoid and angular processes of the mandible (lower jaw) are more prominent.|$|E
50|$|In East Asian {{countries}} such as Japan, China, or Taiwan, the <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> not pulverised, unless requested beforehand. When not pulverised, the <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> collected by the family and stored as one might do with ashes.|$|R
5000|$|Two of his sons, Henry Pierce Bone and Robert Trewick <b>Bone,</b> <b>were</b> also notable enamellists.
