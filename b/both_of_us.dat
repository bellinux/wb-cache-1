25|$|Sir, I {{have the}} honor of informing you that I have arrived in this port with a {{commission}} from the Supreme Government of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata to take possession of these islands {{on behalf of the}} country to which they belong by Natural Law. While carrying out this mission I want to do so with all the courtesy and respect all friendly nations; one of the objectives of my mission is to prevent the destruction of resources necessary for all ships passing by and forced to cast anchor here, as well as to help them to obtain the necessary supplies, with minimum expenses and inconvenience. Since your presence here is not in competition with these purposes and in the belief that a personal meeting will be fruitful for <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> I invite you to come aboard, where you'll be welcomed to stay as long as you wish; I would also greatly appreciate your extending this invitation to any other British subject found in the vicinity; I am, respectfully yours.

In November 1854, while talking about the problem to Rebmann, [...] "at one and the same moment, the problem flashed on <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> solved by the simple supposition that where geographical hypothesis had hitherto supposed an enormous mountain-land, we must now look for an enormous valley and an inland sea." ...|$|E

He compared his relationship to Frost to that of Bill and Hillary Clinton, calling them [...] "a power couple" [...] and adding, [...] "I think that Chadwick was probably attracted to her because of her beauty, [...] also a very smart woman, very successful, also probably a Type A. We really strive, <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> I think, as a very successful actress and with a very successful business. The world is our oyster.

500|$|Later {{she drew}} a {{distinction}} between their methods, arguing that Quimby's involved one mind healing another, while hers depended on a connection with Divine Mind. In February 1883 Julius Dresser, a former patient of Quimby's, accused Eddy in letters to the Boston Post of teaching Quimby's work as her own. In response Eddy disparaged Quimby as a mesmerist and said she had experimented with mental healing in or around 1853, nine years before she met him. She wrote later: [...] "We caught some of his thoughts, and he caught some of ours; and <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were pleased to say this to each other." ...|$|E

"Thinking {{back to when}} we met and {{the many}} times that we spent {{together}} and whenever we were out together, {{there would be a}} caption of some kind, and the caption usually said something like 'an odd couple' or 'an unlikely pair,' but to us it was the most natural and easiest of friendships.... Michael always knew he could count on me to support him or be his date and that we would have fun no matter where we were.

500|$|Some lyrics sung by Beyoncé were sampled from [...] "If I Was Your Girlfriend" [...] by American {{recording}} artist Prince. On the second verse, Jay-Z references {{the relationship between}} Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, and the American television comedy-drama series Sex and the City as he raps: [...] "She riiides wit' me / The new Bobby and Whitney / Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City' / Put us together, how they gon' stop <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us?</b> / When I'm off track, Mommy is keeping us focused". The verse then continues: [...] "Let's lock this down like it's supposed to be/ The new '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov and B".|$|E
500|$|After Alberta's {{two most}} {{prominent}} Liberals, Peter Talbot and Frank Oliver, {{made it clear}} that they were not interested, DeVeber considered himself as a possible candidate. [...] Less than two months before Alberta's formal creation, he wrote to his colleague in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories, Alexander Cameron Rutherford, that the possibilities [...] "practically came to you and I, <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> weak enough God knows but we have the sense to see it." [...] DeVeber's belief that he may be appointed premier does not appear to have been well-founded: his opposition to the introduction of party lines earned him the enmity of some Liberals, not least because it aligned him with Haultain, a Conservative. [...] In the estimation of historian L. G. Thomas, DeVeber's fellow Liberals [...] "were not inclined to take him too seriously" [...] as a potential premier.|$|E
500|$|Because Breckinridge defended {{both the}} Union and {{slavery in the}} General Assembly, he was {{considered}} a moderate early in his political career. In June 1864, Pennsylvania's John W. Forney opined that Breckinridge had been [...] "in no sense an extremist" [...] when elected to Congress in 1851. Of his early encounters with Breckinridge, Forney wrote: [...] "If he had a conscientious feeling, it was hatred of slavery, and <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> 'Democrats' as we were, frequently confessed {{that it was a}} sinful and an anti-Democratic institution, and that the day would come when it must be peaceably or forcibly removed." [...] Heck discounts this statement, pointing out that Forney was editor of a pro-Union newspaper and Breckinridge a Confederate general {{at the time it was}} published. As late as the 1856 presidential election, some alleged that Breckinridge was an abolitionist.|$|E

500|$|Plath's fellow confessional {{poet and}} friend Anne Sexton commented: [...] "Sylvia and I would talk {{at length about}} our first suicide, in detail and in depth—between the free potato chips. Suicide is, after all, the {{opposite}} of the poem. Sylvia and I often talked opposites. We talked death with burned-up intensity, <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> drawn to it like moths to an electric lightbulb, sucking on it. She told the story of her first suicide in sweet and loving detail, and her description in The Bell Jar is just that same story." [...] The confessional interpretation of Plath's work has led to some dismissing certain aspects of her work as an exposition of sentimentalist melodrama; in 2010, for example, Theodore Dalrymple asserted that Plath had been the [...] "patron saint of self-dramatization" [...] and of self-pity. Revisionist critics such as Tracy Brain have, however, argued against a tightly autobiographical interpretation of Plath's material.|$|E
500|$|Saul Matchin {{had hoped}} that his {{daughter}} would become a house servant, but having attended high school, she feels herself too good for that. She is admired by Saul's assistant Sam Sleeny, who lives with the Matchins, a match favored by her father. Sleeny is busy repairing Farnham's outbuildings, and is made jealous by interactions between the captain and Maud. Seeing Sleeny's discontent, Andrew Jackson Offitt (true name Ananias), a locksmith and [...] "professional reformer", tries {{to get him to}} join the Bread-winners, a labor organization. Sleeny is happy with his employment, [...] "Old Saul Matchin and me come to an agreement about time and pay, and <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> was suited. Ef he's got his heel into me, I don't feel it," [...] but due to his unhappiness over Maud, is easy game for Offitt, who gets him to join, and to pay the dues that are Offitt's visible means of support.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by Paul Fedor was filmed between October 31 and November 1, 2006. During {{an interview with}} MTV News, Lee said, [...] "There's the me in all white and it's really wintry, and then there's the all-in-black Amy {{under the surface of}} the water of this lake in the forest. So it's the happiness and the sorrow and we're almost singing to each other, trying to figure out how <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can work." [...] She added that the video was not [...] "so-in-your-face" [...] in order to be made more literal, but expressed her opinion that it's [...] "all about touching somebody and I hope it does that". For the video, fake snow and trees were used along with various other objects which according to the video's scenic coordinator, were supposed to create a [...] "frozen, gothic, cemetery feel". For the scenes filmed in water, a hydraulic lift was used with which Lee could easily sink and the lake water was colored black.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{speaks about}} {{two women who}} chose not to end a {{friendship}} because {{of a man who}} has cheated both of them. Its theme is one of female independence. Beyoncé told MTV News that [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] is about female empowerment, in keeping with the theme of the album: [...] "It's about a guy who's kind of playing <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> and instead of us arguing over the guy we say, 'Forget him. Let's stick together. He's a beautiful liar." [...] The chorus features the lines, [...] "Let's not kill the karma, let's not start a fight" [...] with the female protagonists bonding in their mutual betrayal. Beyoncé and Shakira sing with staccato, intense vocal approach throughout the song. Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "I didn't know about you then, till I saw you with him again" [...] earnestly while Shakira later adds [...] "I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing". In the end, the female protagonists conclude, [...] "we can live without him", referring to their cheating lover.|$|E
500|$|The Spanish {{media has}} often {{compared}} Villa with Raúl, {{to the point}} where Villa was accused of taking the number 7 jersey away from the then-Real Madrid player. In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken anything away from anybody, I was simply playing well for my club and the national coach gave me an opportunity. Too much has been said about the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and I were in the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I just work hard for myself. All I want is to be in the squad for every game, to have the Spain badge on my chest and to score as many goals as I can." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2005, it was {{revealed}} Elliott {{had been working on}} a new album. Two months later, Ciara confirmed she would appear on the album, singing and rapping on the potential first untitled single at the time. Elliott worked on The Cookbook with such producers as the Neptunes, Rich Harrison and Scott Storch. The album included only two songs produced by Timbaland, who produced most or all songs on Elliott's previous albums. She explained, [...] "Me and Tim, this like our sixth album, so if we go any further left, we gonna be on Mars somewhere. We've done everything it is to do. I think <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> came to a spot where we didn't know where to go with each other." [...] She said Timbaland was very involved with the album, supporting or opposing certain producers. Elliott went on to say, [...] "I was eight songs deep and I let Tim listen and he was like, 'Nah, you're going in the wrong direction. You trippin'.' I had to go back in the studio and come up with new records. , he was like, 'This is the Missy people are listening to.'" ...|$|E
