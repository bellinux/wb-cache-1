2500|$|Anxieties that Brown {{might change}} the {{identity}} of The New Yorker as a cultural institution prompted a number of resignations. George Trow, {{who had been with}} the magazine for almost three decades, accused Brown of [...] "kissing the ass of celebrity" [...] in his resignation letter. (To which Brown reportedly replied, [...] "I am distraught at your defection <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>you</b> never actually write anything I should say I am notionally distraught.") The departing Jamaica Kincaid described Brown as [...] "a bully" [...] and [...] "Stalin in high heels." ...|$|E

And we worship them not as God, as you maintain, God forbid!... Even the little children mock at you. Go into one of their schools, {{say that you are}} the enemy of images, and straightway they will throw their little tablets at your head, and what you have failed to learn from the wise you may pick up from the foolish... In virtue of the power which has come down to us from St. Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, we might inflict a punishment upon you, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>you</b> have invoked one on yourself, have that, you and the counsellors you have chosen... though you have so excellent a high priest, our brother Germanus, whom you ought to have taken into your counsels as father and teacher[...] [...] [...] The dogmas of the Church are not a matter for the emperor, but for the bishops.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Having {{decided to}} marry, Darwin visited his cousin Emma on 29 July 1838 {{and told her}} of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November he {{returned}} and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote, [...] "When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep {{out of my head}} <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>you</b> are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviours farewell discourse to his disciples which begins {{at the end of the}} 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best. This is a whim of mine it would give me great pleasure, though I can hardly tell why I don't wish you to give me your opinion about it." ...|$|E
