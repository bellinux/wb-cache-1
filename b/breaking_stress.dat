5|$|The finger {{bones of}} bats {{are much more}} {{flexible}} than those of other mammals, owing to their flattened cross-section and to low levels of minerals, such as calcium, near their tips. The elongation of bat digits, a key feature required for wing development, {{is due to the}} upregulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps). During embryonic development, the gene controlling Bmp signaling, Bmp2, is subjected to increased expression in bat forelimbs—resulting in the extension of the manual digits. This crucial genetic alteration helps create the specialized limbs required for volant locomotion. The relative proportion of extant bat forelimb digits compared with those of Eocene fossil bats have no significant differences in relative digit proportion, suggesting that bat wing morphology has been conserved for over 50 million years. During flight, the bones take on bending and shearing stress; and the bending stresses felt are smaller than terrestrial mammals, however the shearing stress is larger. The wing bones of bats have a slightly lower <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> point than those of birds.|$|E

50|$|Authentic paint craquelure {{occurs because}} paint dries and becomes less {{flexible}} as it ages and shrinks. In {{the case of}} paintings on canvas, the canvas slackens as it ages as it cannot endure the long-term stress of stretching. Paint {{at the center of}} a painting is the least cracked, whereas paint at the edges is the most cracked, or stressed. The precise pattern of craquelure depends on where, when, and under what conditions the picture was painted, and subsequently kept. Cracks caused by stretching or slackening the canvas are quite different from cracks due to other factors, such as drying and ageing of the paint. The paint cracks when the stress upon it is greater than the <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> point of the paint layer and the paint will crack approximately at right-angles to the direction of the stress, relieving that stress. The stress at the corners is more than double that of the center.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the protein content of soybean seeds and the consistency of tofu was examined for six Japanese soybean varieties, Enrei, Fukuyutaka, Sachiyutaka, Ayakogane, Hatayutaka and Tachinagaha. The seed protein content was estimated by determining the nitrogen content using the Dumas method. Tofu was prepared from a raw homogenate of water-soaked soybeans by heating and {{by the addition of}} MgCl_ 2 as a coagulant. The tofu consistency was evaluated by measuring the <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu curd using a Creep meter. The <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu increased when the concentrations of MgCl_ 2 in soymilk increased above 0. 20 %. The <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> reached a maximum value at concentrations of around 0. 40 %, with differences among soybean varieties and cultivation conditions of the soybeans. There was a significant positive correlation (r = 0. 87) between the maximum <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu and the seed protein content for the six varieties. In contrast, the <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu prepared with 0. 25 % MgCl_ 2 did not show a significant correlation (r = 0. 27) with the seed protein content for the six varieties but was significantly correlated (r = 0. 52), when the data of Sachiyutaka were excluded. Fukuyutaka and Ayakogane required a lower MgCl_ 2 concentration for the maximum <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu than Sachiyutaka, Enrei, Tachinagaha and Hatayntaka, which required a MgCl_ 2 concentration above 0. 40 % for the maximum <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu. Especially, Sachiyutaka required the highest MgCl_ 2 concentration, 0. 45 % on the average, for the maximum <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu among the six varieties. Sachiyutaka-tofu showed the lowest <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> on the average at a concentration of 0. 25 % MgCl_ 2, which is the concentration generally used by manufacturers, in spite of its high content in seed protein. In contrast, Fukuyutaka required the lowest MgCl_ 2 concentration, 0. 34 % on the average, for the maximum <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> and the highest <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu prepared with 0. 25 % MgCl_ 2.

40|$|Abstract — An {{original}} {{approach to}} compute the longitudinal tensile <b>break</b> <b>stress</b> of multiphase composite materials with short fibers reinforcement is presented. The most obvious mechanical model which reflects a multiphase composite material is a pre-impregnated material, known as prepreg. We may include in this class of prepregs, Sheet- and Bulk Moulding Compounds. The model is seen as consisting of three phase compounds: resin, filler and fibers, model that is reduced to two phase compounds: substitute matrix and fibers. The Sheet Moulding Compounds reinforced with discontinuous and almost parallel fibers, subjected to longitudinal tensile loads, presents a specific note by {{the existence of a}} shear mechanism between fibers and matrix. This shear mechanism transfers the tensile load through the fibers. The Young’s moduli for the substitute matrix and for the entire composite are computed and a comparison between the theoretical approach and the experimental data is accomplished...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} scale on the {{estimated}} stresses and safety {{factors in the}} humeri of several bird and bat species were investigated. This was accomplished by estimating the lift distribution across the wings at two extremes of flight, gliding flight and the downstroke in hovering, finding the center of lift on the wings at these two extremes and calculating the applied bending and twisting moments. This information, along with measurements of mechanically important morphological variables, allowed for estimates of bending and shearing stresses in the humeri for both gliding flight and on the downstroke in hovering. The stresses in flapping flight other than hovering should fall somewhere between these two values. It {{was found that the}} stresses in the humeri are not scale-dependent and that the bending stresses are slightly lower than those found in the limbs of terrestrial animals, while the shearing stresses are larger than those in terrestrial limbs. The <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of bird and bat wing bone was also investigated. Both materials were found to have a lower <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> than that of typical long bone material. The ratio between the <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of the material and the estimated stresses was defined as the safety factor.
