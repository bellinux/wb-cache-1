5|$|After {{beginning}} the 1998–99 {{season on the}} Canucks' top line, Bertuzzi was limited to 32 games due to injuries, {{the first of which}} was a fractured tibia. He suffered the injury on November 1, 1998, after a shot by teammate Mattias Öhlund hit him in the leg. His season was later ended with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee, suffered during a game on March 5, 1999. He recorded 8 goals and 16 points in 1998–99. In the off-season, Bertuzzi became a restricted free agent and was re-signed by the Canucks to a two-year contract in September 1999. The deal was reported by The Vancouver Sun to <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>a</b> little over $2 million.|$|E
5|$|Real's {{traditional}} away colours are all blue or all purple. Since {{the advent}} of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998. Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992. In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens Mobile and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt. Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens. It is currently Fly Emirates which is set to expire in 2018. In 2015, Madrid signed a new 10-year contract believed to <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>a</b> total of £850 million (€1 billion), earning £59 million (€64 million) per season.|$|E

25|$|In summary {{it would}} appear that in compromising his {{indebtedness}} with the Bank, Dr. Fitzgerald disposed of his only substantial asset, namely, his family home at Palmerston Road, a property which would now <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>a</b> considerable sum of money. As in Mr. Haughey's case, there was a substantial discounting or forbearance shown in Dr. Fitzgerald's case. However in contrast with Mr. Haughey's case, Dr. Fitzgerald's case involved the effective exhaustion of his assets in order to achieve a settlement whereas Mr. Haughey's assets were retained virtually intact.|$|E

25|$|With no {{contract}} for 2004, Villeneuve {{was forced to}} take a sabbatical, but maintained {{that he wanted to}} return to the sport. He continued training and made a special appearance at the Goodwood Festival of Speed driving his late father's Ferrari. In September, Villeneuve returned to Formula One, driving the final three Grands Prix of the season for the French Renault team. Jarno Trulli had fallen out of favour and team boss Flavio Briatore felt Villeneuve would <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>a</b> gamble. Although vowing to help Renault achieve second place in the Constructors' Championship, ahead of his former team BAR, Villeneuve failed to score a single point, unable to finish any of his races on the lead lap; Renault settled for third in the final standings. Villeneuve admitted that the enforced lay-off had cost him vital seat time. With the cars so much faster than in 2003, he found it difficult to adapt, and with an up-and-coming Fernando Alonso as teammate his task was made all the more difficult. The young Spaniard proved faster. Just before his 3-race Renault comeback, Villeneuve signed a two-year contract to drive for Sauber, starting in 2005.|$|E
500|$|Britten's {{incidental}} {{music for}} theatre, film and radio, {{much of it}} unpublished, {{was the subject of}} an essay by William Mann, published in 1952 in the first detailed critical assessment of Britten's music to that date. Of these pieces the music for a radio play, The Rescue, by Edward Sackville-West, is praised by the musicologist Lewis Foreman as [...] "of such stature and individual character as to <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>a</b> regular place alongside [...] other dramatic scores." [...] Mann finds in this score pre-echoes of the second act of Billy Budd, while Foreman observes that Britten [...] "appears to have made passing allusions to The Rescue in his final opera, Death in Venice.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} for Uncut, Richard Williams writes that Wonderwall Music {{represents}} [...] "an exploded diagram of a Beatles album", which includes [...] "reamy miniature ragas", [...] "a pub knees-up gatecrashed by a Dixieland band ('Drilling A Home')" [...] and [...] "the bones of early acid-rock songs ('Red Lady Too' and 'Party Seacombe')". Williams describes the album as [...] "a treat {{from start to}} finish" [...] offering [...] "an innocent optimism that will always <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>a</b> listen". New Zealand Herald critic Graham Reid considers [...] "Dream Scene" [...] to be [...] "by far the most psychedelic and out-there piece by any Beatle to that time", adding that [...] "towards the end you can almost anticipate Lennon's Revolution 9 coming in." [...] Reid describes the album as, variously, [...] "peculiar and terrific" [...] and [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} and courageously different of [...] solo albums".|$|E
500|$|The male {{characters}} in South Pacific {{are intended to}} appear conventionally masculine. [...] In the aftermath of World War II, the masculinity of the American soldier was beyond public question. [...] Cable's virility with Liat is made evident to the audience. [...] Although Billis operates a laundry – Nellie particularly praises his pleats – and appears in a grass skirt in the [...] "Thanksgiving Follies", these acts are consistent with his desire for money and are clearly intended to be comic. [...] His interest in the young ladies on Bali H'ai establishes his masculinity. [...] Lovensheimer writes that Billis is more defined by class than by sexuality, evidenced by the Seabee's assumption, on learning that Cable went to college in New Jersey, that it was Rutgers (the state's flagship public university), rather than Ivy League Princeton, and by his delight on learning that the rescue operation for him had cost $600,000 when his uncle had {{told him he would}} never <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>a</b> dime.|$|E
500|$|Breckinridge's {{communication}} with his supporters between the meetings indicated greater willingness {{to become a}} candidate, but he instructed Clay to nominate him only if his support exceeded Guthrie's. Many believed that Buchanan supported Breckinridge, but Breckinridge wrote to Beck that [...] "The President is not for me except as a last necessity, {{that is to say}} not until his help will not <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>a</b> damn." [...] After a majority of the delegates, most of them Douglas supporters, voted to replace Alabama and Louisiana's walk-out delegates with new, pro-Douglas men in Baltimore, Virginia's delegation led another walk-out of Southern Democrats and Buchanan-controlled delegates from the northeast and Pacific coast; 105 delegates, including 10 of Kentucky's 24, left, and the remainder nominated Douglas. The walk-outs held a rival nominating convention, styled the National Democratic Convention, at the Maryland Institute in Baltimore. At that convention on June 23, Massachusetts' George B. Loring nominated Breckinridge for president, and he received 81 of the 105 votes cast, the remainder going to Daniel S. Dickinson of New York. Oregon's Joseph Lane was nominated for vice-president.|$|E

500|$|There {{were also}} a few {{positive}} reviews. One such review came from Fraser McAlpine of BBC, who opened, [...] "It's {{one of the fundamental}} laws of pop, anything which tips a nod to 'You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)' by Dead Or Alive is going to <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>a</b> listen." [...] He continued, [...] "Even though this is just a song written {{from the perspective of a}} randy man watching a pole-dancer and bragging about how much money he has [...] in a manner which would make Akon blush, there's just something kind of cute about the whole thing." [...] McAlpine attributed this to the song's [...] "Tigger-beat", explaining, [...] "How can anything too sordid be going on when everyone is bouncing around like they're on spacehoppers?" [...] Bill Lamb of About.com commented, [...] "You will hear echoes of another pop classic, but the new song stands on its own feet." [...] However, he noted that while pop music fans would appreciate it, hip hop listeners would likely dismiss it, and he added that [...] "t's not groundbreaking by any means".|$|E
500|$|The Dreamcast port of Incoming {{received}} a mixed reaction from critics. IGN opened their review by saying that, although the game [...] "is lacking in many areas, there's {{more than enough}} here for the hardcore shooting fans out there to have their requisite blast of shooting action." [...] Though criticizing the graphics' ability to [...] "get in the way at times," [...] the [...] "very vague" [...] mission briefings and the [...] "odd flying model for the planes," [...] the reviewer conceded that [...] "if you're a hardcore shooting fan, and you're {{looking for a good}} challenge, you'll probably want to look into Incoming." [...] GameSpy's review was harsher, describing the plot as [...] "the same recycled garbage used in tons of other games of this type," [...] the multiplayer split screen mode as [...] "lame" [...] and the objectives as [...] "mundane." [...] The reviewer also noted graphical issues, clipping problems and poor controls. Though dismissing the graphics as [...] "a bit dated," [...] the reviewer did acknowledge the [...] "nifty special effects" [...] and admitted that [...] "Incoming may <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>a</b> rental... is only slightly better than mediocre." [...] In a rare positive review for the Dreamcast version, GameVortex described the visuals as [...] "some of the most breathtaking visuals you'll find in any game." [...] Though describing the multiplayer as [...] "fun", it considered [...] "by far, the best [...] Campaign mode." [...] The review concluded by describing the game as [...] "lots of fun and highly recommended." ...|$|E
500|$|Wright {{initially}} rejected Lovecraft's [...] "The Call of Cthulhu", {{but eventually}} bought it, and printed {{it in the}} February 1928 issue. [...] This was the first tale of the Cthulhu Mythos, a fictional universe in which Lovecraft set several stories. [...] Over time other writers began to contribute their own stories with the same shared background, including Frank Belknap Long, August Derleth, E. Hoffman Price, and Donald Wandrei. [...] Robert E. Howard and Clark Ashton Smith were friends of Lovecraft's, but did not contribute Cthulhu stories; instead Howard wrote sword and sorcery fiction, and Smith produced a series of high fantasy stories, {{many of which were}} part of his Hyperborean cycle. [...] Robert Bloch, later to become well known as the writer of the movie Psycho, began publishing stories in Weird Tales in 1935; he was a fan of Lovecraft's work, and asked Lovecraft's permission to include Lovecraft as a character in one of his stories, and to kill the character off. [...] Lovecraft gave him permission, and reciprocated by killing off a thinly disguised version of Bloch in one of his own stories not long afterwards. Edmond Hamilton, a leading early writer of space opera, became a regular, and Wright also published science fiction stories by J. Schlossel and Otis Adelbert Kline. [...] Tennessee Williams' first sale was to Weird Tales, with a short story titled [...] "The Vengeance of Nitocris". This was published in the August 1928 issue under the author's real name, Thomas Lanier Williams.Weird Tales subtitle was [...] "The Unique Magazine", and Wright's story selections were as varied as the subtitle promised; he was willing to print strange or bizarre stories with no hint [...] of the fantastic if they were unusual enough to fit in the magazine. [...] Although Wright's editorial standards were broad, and although he personally disliked the restrictions that convention placed on what he could publish, he did exercise caution when presented with material that might offend his readership. [...] E. Hoffman Price records that his story [...] "Stranger from Kurdistan" [...] was held after purchase for six months before Wright printed it in the July 1925 issue; the story includes a scene in which Christ and Satan meet, and Wright was worried about the possible reader reaction. [...] The story nevertheless proved to be very popular, and Wright reprinted it in the December 1929 issue. [...] He also published [...] "The Infidel's Daughter" [...] by Price, a satire of the Ku Klux Klan, which drew an angry letter and a cancelled subscription from a Klan member. [...] Price later recalled Wright's response: [...] "a story that arouses controversy is good for circulation... and anyway it would <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>a</b> reasonable loss to rap bigots of that caliber". [...] Wright also printed George Fielding Eliot's [...] "The Copper Bowl", a story about a young woman being tortured; she dies when her torturer forces a rat to eat through her body. [...] Weinberg suggests that the story was so gruesome {{that it would have been}} difficult to place in a magazine even fifty years later.|$|E
