40|$|In recent years, {{studies on}} the {{development}} of lignocellulose plastics (LCPs) on the basis of polymer and wood wastes have been recently under way. LCPs represent highly filled composites, containing organic fillers in quantities of up to 60 %, and, with success, may be applied in machine-building and construction.

Despite the high content of the filler, the LCP melt retains plasticity, characteristic for thermoplastics, and can be processed by the same processing methods. The majority of the proposed modes for the development of such type of the composites is based on the ion-radical or electrostatic mechanism of the interaction between the active groups of the introduced additive/filler and the oxidised fragments of the basic polymer leading to decreasing a content of hydrophilic functional groups in the end-used composite material...|$|E

Its bark is not suitable to produce bleached pulp; hence, it is discarded as waste.

First, the structure of condensed tannin from the <b>bark</b> <b>waste</b> of A. crassicarpa is characterized. The yield of the extracts obtained from A. crassicarpa using a 70 % acetone aqueous solution (7 % based on bark weight) is less than that obtained from A. mearnsii (34 %). A novel flavan dimer from the condensed tannin, specific to A. crassicarpa, is isolated from the bark extracts. To the best of our knowledge, this dimer is a new compound as evidenced from pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses; it corresponds to a gallocatechin–catechin flavan dimer with the absence of one oxygen atom at the 3 C of the pyran ring.

Usually, 1 g ethanol can produce approximately 27 kJ of energy, and therefore, the energy input for the microwave pretreatment was only 7 % of the energy output.

40|$|AbstractBiosorption {{of nickel}} ions from aqueous {{solutions}} by modified loquat <b>bark</b> <b>waste</b> (MLB) {{has been investigated}} in a batch biosorption process. The biosorbent MLB was characterized by FTIR analysis. The extent of biosorption of Ni(II) ions {{was found to be}} dependent on solution pH, initial nickel ions concentration, biosorbent dose, contact time, and temperature. The experimental equilibrium biosorption data were analyzed by three widely used two-parameters Langmuir, Temkin and Freundlich isotherm models. Langmuir and Temkin isotherm models provided a better fit with the experimental data than Freundlich isotherm model by high correlation coefficients R 2. The maximum adsorption capacity was 27. 548 mg/g of Ni(II) ions onto MLB. The thermodynamic analysis indicated that the biosorption behavior of nickel ions onto MLB biosorbent was an endothermic process, resulting in higher biosorption capacities at higher temperatures. The negative values of ΔG° (− 5. 84 kJ/mol) and positive values of ΔH° (13. 33 kJ/mol) revealed that the biosorption process was spontaneous and endothermic. Kinetic studies showed that pseudo-second order described well the biosorption experimental data.

The available infrastructure consists of 17 fluidized bed combustors (FBC) with a total thermal capacity of 700 MW and three fluidized bed gasifiers with a total thermal capacity of 33 MW. Eight FBC plants have circulating beds while the other three have bubbling beds. In Austria, FBCs for biomass are employed in the heat and electricity producing industry, in the pulp and paper industry, and in the sewage sludge treatment. Additionally, the heat and electricity industry employs the three fluidized bed gasifiers.

This is enough electricity to power a 3-bedroom European house for an entire year, or enough energy to heat and air-condition the average North American home for almost six months. Recycling paper to make pulp actually consumes more fossil fuels than making new pulp via the kraft process; these mills generate most of their energy from burning <b>waste</b> wood (<b>bark,</b> roots, sawmill <b>waste)</b> and byproduct lignin (black liquor). Pulp mills producing new mechanical pulp use large amounts of energy; a very rough estimate of the electrical energy needed is 10 gigajoules per tonne of pulp (2500 kW·h per short ton).|$|R
40|$|A low-cost, easily obtained, high {{efficiency}} and eco-friendly adsorbents {{has been investigated}} as an ideal alternative to the current expensive methods of removing dyes from wastewater. This study explores the feasibility of using mangrove <b>bark,</b> an agricultural <b>waste,</b> for removal of synthetic dyes from aqueous solutions. The adsorption characteristics of direct red- 23 onto Rhizophora apiculata bark that has been previously treated with formaldehyde in acid medium were investigated. Batch experiments were carried out for the adsorption of dyes molecules onto modified barks at room temperature (30 ± 2) ºC. The equilibrium adsorption isotherms and kinetics were investigated. The adsorption equilibrium data were analyzed by using various adsorption isotherm models and the results have shown that adsorption behavior of this dye could be described reasonably well by a generalized isotherm. The monolayer sorption capacity of modified barks for direct red- 23 adsorption {{was found to be}} 21. 55 mg g− 1. The adsorption kinetics was found to follow pseudo- second order kinetic. Various factors such as pH, contact time, initial dyes concentrations, and amount of adsorbent were taken into account, and promising results were obtained. These results indicate that mangrove bark could be employed as a low-cost material for the removal of the textile dyes from effluents...|$|R
