5|$|In December 2012, Whedon {{stated that}} he had {{completed}} an outline for the film. In February, at the 2013 Jameson Dublin International Film Festival, Whedon said that death would play a theme in the sequel, and in March, {{he said that he}} looked to The Empire Strikes <b>Back</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Godfather Part II as inspirations.|$|E
5|$|The {{immature}} American goldfinch has a dull brown <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> underside is pale yellow. The {{shoulders and}} tail are dull black with buff-colored, rather than white, markings on wings and rump. This coloration {{is the same}} in both genders.|$|E

5|$|Troop sleeper #7437 is {{on display}} at the B Railroad Museum in Baltimore, MD. It was {{purchased}} as surplus by the Western Maryland Railroad and used on work trains as crew quarters. The museum has restored it to its original outside appearance. The inside has half the beds put <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other half has displays about the B RR during the war.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bristol's {{architecture}} is the Bristol Byzantine style. Characterised by complicated polychrome brick and decorative arches, this style {{was used in}} the construction of factories, warehouses and municipal buildings built in the Victorian era. Surviving examples include the Colston Hall, the Granary on Welsh <b>Back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gloucester Road Carriage Works, along with some of the buildings around Victoria Street. Several of the warehouses around the harbour have also survived, including the Arnolfini, which now houses an art gallery. Clarks Wood Company warehouse, the St Vincent's Works in Silverthorne Lane, and the Wool Hall in St Thomas Street, are other survivors from the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve integumentary structures (filaments {{arising from the}} skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and {{top and bottom of}} the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified {{on the sides of the}} body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E
50|$|Naumann's thrush has pale brown <b>back</b> <b>and</b> head. <b>The</b> face, breast, flank {{spots and}} rump are reddish, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> belly <b>and</b> undertail are white, whereas dusky thrush has a darker brown <b>back</b> <b>and</b> rump, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> face, breast, <b>and</b> flank spots rump are black. <b>The</b> belly <b>and</b> undertail are white.|$|R

5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E
5|$|At 03:00, the 8th Heavy Company, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment with 75mm SP guns, 20mm AA guns, and mortars {{attacked}} 'A' and 'C' Companies, 7th Parachute Battalion, {{from the}} south. The paratroops were forced <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Germans established their own positions in Bénouville, but {{were unable to}} break the British line. They dug in and waited for tank support before moving forward again. The Germans fired mortar bombs and machine guns at the paratroopers and attempted small assaults on their positions throughout the night.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third serial, Quatermass and the Pit (1958–59), Quatermass's funding is being cut <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Rocket Group is being handed over to military control, much to his disgust. Command is to be handed over to Colonel Breen and Quatermass senses that he is being forced out: however, after the events of the serial, Breen is dead, Quatermass has helped to save the world and London is recovering from chaos.|$|E

Rodman attended to the most severely wounded victim.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{his sophomore}} year, Blount had become one of the highest ranked junior college {{prospect}}s. He was named the nation's top junior college running <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> No. 12 overall prospect in the Rivals.com Junior College Top 100. Blount was heavily recruited by several high-major schools, including Florida State and West Virginia. He committed to Oregon in December 2007. Oregon coaches said Blount reminded them of former Oregon and NFL running back Reuben Droughns.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 Aurobindo withdrew {{himself from}} all {{political}} activities {{and went into}} hiding at Chandannagar {{in the house of}} Motilal Roy, while the British were trying to prosecute him for sedition {{on the basis of a}} signed article titled 'To My Countrymen', published in Karmayogin. As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a French colony. The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.|$|E

50|$|In October 2015, the Professional Roughstock Series {{announced}} {{on its website}} that it would suspend operations. It {{was due to the}} loss of financial <b>backing</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> inexperience of leadership that finally was its ultimate demise.|$|R

5|$|In September, Sitting Bull {{and about}} one hundred Hunkpapa Lakota {{encountered}} a small party near {{what is now}} Marmarth, North Dakota. They {{had been left behind}} by a wagon train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier. The bullet exited out through the small of his <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wound was not serious.|$|E
5|$|In the Vistula-Oder Offensive in January, 1945, the 3rd Belorussian Front was {{tasked with}} driving into East Prussia from the east. The 31st Army {{was not on}} an assault sector, {{and in the first}} stages it was ordered to hold its {{positions}} stubbornly. By January 23–24, the 331st had joined in pursuit of the retreating German forces, and along with its corps helped capture the important road junction of Blenkheim, and the strongpoint of Treuburg on the approaches to Lötzen. However, {{in the first week of}} February, the German command had regrouped their 129th and 558th Infantry Divisions as well as units of the 24th Panzer Division, which counterattacked in an attempt to encircle units of the 71st Rifle Corps; after several days fighting the attacks were beaten <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> advance resumed towards Kanditten.|$|E
5|$|In the autumn, {{the leaves}} die <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> outer {{scales of the}} bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is then {{normally}} harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point {{in the middle of}} the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The inflorescence takes the form of a globular umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section.|$|E

5|$|Like its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Melee {{differs from}} {{traditional}} fighting games as {{the objective is}} to force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each character's health is measured by a meter that represents the damage received as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> easier they are to knock off the stage, which will result in the character's death and the loss of a stock, or life. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which moves are entered by button-input combinations, most moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and a joystick direction.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse (Macrotarsomys petteri), is a Madagascan rodent in {{the genus}} Macrotarsomys. With a head and body length of 150mm (5.9in) and body mass of 105g (3.7oz), It {{is the largest}} species of its genus. The upperparts are brown, darkest {{in the middle of}} the <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> underparts are white to yellowish. The animal has long whiskers, short forelimbs, and long hindfeet. The tail ends in a {{prominent}} tuft of long, light hairs. The skull is robust and the molars are low-crowned and cuspidate.|$|E
5|$|Several {{locations}} {{from the}} Star Wars films have been recreated as maps for multiplayer gaming.

The capture the flag multiplayer mode has been altered since Dark Forces II. The player must now steal a ysalamir from the other team {{and return it to}} his or her own base. The ysalamir has the added effect of reducing the Force powers of the player who is carrying it.|$|E
