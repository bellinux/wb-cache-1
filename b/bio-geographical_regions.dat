40|$|This {{case study}} tested an {{approach}} for large-scale monetary valuation of water purification services based on spatially explicit, biophysical mapping of nitrogen retention in river networks. The study {{area for the}} case study was the Mediterranean <b>bio-geographical</b> <b>region.</b> The monetary value of nitrogen retention was assessed using replacement costs (RCs), based on the construction, operation and maintenance of constructed wetlands (CWs). The value of nitrogen retention by rivers in 2005 was estimated at € 2167 km– 1, on average. If the capacity or the potential of rivers and lakes to retain nitrogen was considered, the monetary value was € 35, 000 km– 1 on average, {{much higher than the}} effective retention. The coupling between a biophysical model simulating the transport and retention of nitrogen in the aquatic environment and monetary estimates of potential and realized nitrogen removal resulted in detailed spatial information of one of the benefits that are provided by rivers and streams.

40|$|The Mediterranean basin is an {{area that}} is {{characterized}} by its high diversity in several inter-related aspects: biological, cultural, economic, social and historical. It is a well defined <b>bio-geographical</b> <b>region</b> showing a high biodiversity content, even in cases, where nature is restricted to small residual fragments. High variability has been recorded at all levels of biodiversity in the region. The wealth of plant species found in Mediterranean forests {{is one of the main}} features, that distinguishes them from the forests of central and Northern Europe; Mediterranean forests have twice as many woody species as European forests. The diversity of animal species (i. e. avifauna) is very high as well, especially when it is expressed by the ratio between species richness and area. Furthermore, Mediterranean populations of species with a Pan-European distribution, such as fir, beech, pine and spruce, are often characterized as the most variable in terms of genetic diversity. Besides species and genes, diversity is the main characteristic of the Mediterranean landscape as well. The evolution of species and ecosystems has not been uniform, but it followed rather a mosaic-like pattern. During the geological and climatic histor...|$|R
40|$|Early in his {{landmark}} ecocritical book The Comedy of Survival, Joseph Meeker develops {{an intriguing}} hypothesis about human behaviour. He remarks the species Homo sapiens tend {{to behave like}} an invasive or pioneering organism, entering a <b>bio-geographical</b> <b>region</b> and aggressively outcompeting all other species for space and resources. Moreover, he suggests, human cultural traditions, {{at least in the}} West, have reinforced such behaviour, continually insisting that the impulses he describes are both necessary and right. While Meeker's work goes on to assess a number of literary works in both the tragic and comic modes, his work never fully explores this hypothesis in the context of human pioneers; that is, there is no ~xploration o(how these themes manifest themselves within our culture and what role they might play in the culture of specific pioneering groups. This project is an attempt at just such an analysis, examining the validity of Meeker's hypothesis through a case study of settler literature in Upper Canada/Ontario between the. years 1800 - 1867. It explores Meeker's work within three main areas: first, Chapter Two situates his book historically within the field of ecocriticism, showing what came before and the explosion of ecocritical inquiry that followed its release. This chapter also delves into the rift between the natural sciences and humanities, arguing that a move towards deeper interdisciplinarity is r:tecessary for the future. Chapter Three examines the biological and ecological ground on which Meeker rests his hypothesis through exploring evolutionary biology as well as invasive and pioneer species behaviour. Lastly, Chapter Four examines how these ecological principles are manifested in the writings of early Canadian settlers, suggesting that Meeker's hypothesis indeed finds itself on stable footing...|$|R

For Switzerland, GIS-compliant delimitations of the tree line and the forest line are still lacking. Recent high-resolution landcover information offers new possibilities for GIS-based approaches. In a Swiss-wide study, an analysis based on slope zones was combined with a moving-window analysis to assess tree and forest line altitude, using topographic data. The tree and the forest lines were delimited at the upper altitude reached by a tree or closed forest respectively. The model delivered a fine-scaled delimitation sensitive to local conditions.

40|$|The major {{bottleneck}} {{during the}} domestication of the white-margined sole Dagetichthys marginatus in South Africa has been low larval survival. The {{cause of this}} is not clear but considering current literature on flatfish culture and more specifically soleid culture, nutritional deficiencies are hypothesized {{to be the main}} possible cause. Following the importance of nutrition, the first aim of the research was to use an ontogenetic developmental approach to develop a species specific larval feeding strategy. Ontogenetic development of D. marginatus showed that weaning will take place at much later ages than other soleids currently being farmed. This makes the partial replacement of Artemia with a suitable inert diet in co-feeding strategies very important to cut the cost associated of live food production. This leads on to the second aim, in which an 'in vitro' approach was used to model the digestibility of Artemia, which could ultimately contribute towards designing inert feeds with similar digestibility characteristics to Artemia in the future. Obtaining nutrients from food is closely linked to the functional status of the digestive tract, the support organs and the external morphological characteristics required for the ingestion of live or inert feeds. Considering both morphological and physiological ontogenetic development, it is clear that D. marginatus follow a similar pattern to other soleids. Larvae can successfully feed on Artemia as early as 3 days after hatching but exhibit a slow metamorphosis into the juvenile stage when compared to other soleids. The absence of any detectable acidic protease activity during the first 45 days of development and the importance of exogenous enzymes from Artemia all points to limited capacity to digest artificial diets. Prior to modelling the 'in vitro' digestion of Artemia, digestive enzyme activity at different pH's were modelled using functional forms from the normal distributive category of functions. As there is no substantiated information for the general effects of pH on enzyme activity in the literature for finfish larvae, three species occurring in the same <b>bio-geographical</b> <b>region</b> of Dagetichthys marginatus, namely Sarpa salpa, Diplodus sargus capensis and Argyrosomus japonicus were used to investigate this effect. The fitted parameters, namely the optimal pH and sigma (the slope around the optimal pH) showed two interesting results. When using a negative log likelihood ratio test to test for differences between species for a particular enzyme, the optimal pH for alkaline proteases (7. 67), lipase (8. 03), amylase (7. 69) and phosphatase (9. 84) activity was the same for all three species. Furthermore, the study illustrated the potential to detect dietary shifts during ontogenetic development based on changes in enzyme activity around the optimal pH using the sigma parameter. Sarpa salpa showed increased amylase activity and a decrease in protease activity around the optimal pH with increased size, corresponding to a change in diet from zooplankton to algae. The 'in vitro' modelling approach taken in this study was based on known enzyme interactions and dynamics which makes the results very interpretable. from Artemia is achieved based on gut evacuation time and enzyme levels. This 'in vitro' study furthermore clearly indicates the importance of exogenous enzymes from Artemia, contributing as much as 54 percent to protein digestion and 64 – 72 percent to carbohydrate digestion. This was however, only an initial investigation, and further expansion of the model is required to achieve a complete understanding of Artemia digestion and ultimately partial replacement with artificial diets. A feeding strategy for D. marginatus should therefore follow those of other farmed soleids, although there will be a general delay in implementation due to slower development. Problems can thus be solved and improvements made by transferring technology from other soleids to D. marginatus...|$|R

40|$|Senescence, {{the process}} of {{physiological}} deterioration associated with growing old, is a shared characteristic {{of a wide range}} of animals. Yet, lifespan varies dramatically among species. To explain this variation, the evolutionary theory of ageing has been proposed more than 50 yr ago. Although the theory has been tested experimentally and through comparative analyses, there remains debate whether its fundamental prediction is empirically supported. Here, we use a comprehensive database on avian life history traits to test the evolutionary theory of ageing at a global scale. We show that pronounced geographical gradients of maximum longevity exist, that they are predicted by measures of predator diversity and only partly depend on correlated life-history traits. The results are consistent with species-level analyses and can be replicated across <b>bio-geographical</b> <b>regions.</b> Our analyses suggest that stochastic predation is an important driver of the evolution of lifespan, at least in birds...|$|E

In this study, we used a generalized dissimilarity modeling approach to analyze and predict the spatial {{patterns of}} beta diversity for commercially exploited, demersal marine species assemblages along the Tunisian coasts. For this study, we used a presence/absence dataset which included information on 174 species (inverte-brates and fishes) and 9 environmental variables. We first performed the modeling analyses and assessed beta diversity using the turnover component of the Jaccard’s dissimilarity index. We then performed nonmetric multidimensional scaling to map predicted beta diver-sity. To delineate the biogeographical regions, we used fuzzy cluster analysis. Finally, we also identified a set of indicator species which characterized the species assemblages in each identified biogeographical region.

40|$|Because {{it has a}} {{specific}} geographic position and it’s situated {{at the crossroads of}} several <b>bio-geographical</b> <b>regions</b> {{and as a result of}} its ecological characteristics, the climate and geo-morphological conditions, Croatia is one of the wealthiest countries from Europe concerning the biodiversity. The great variety of the territory, maritime and underground habitats has determined the existence of numerous species and subspecies, including a significant number of endemic species. Although the climate of Croatia has a great value, many of its components are threatened. The most important threats of wild species are losing the habitats and the degradation. Because of its shape and its position in Europe, Croatia has very rich landscape diversity. Croatia contains significant populations of many species that are threatened at the European level. These are connected to preserved large areas of their habitats. Vast mountain beech and fir forests are rich in bear, wolf and lynx populations.

40|$|In the European Union, the Directive 92 / 43 /EEC {{defines a}} number of species and {{habitats}} of community interest that are worthy to be preserved because in danger to disappear or because they {{are representative of the}} different European <b>bio-geographical</b> <b>regions.</b> In the light of the limited economic resources generally allocated to conservation efforts, there is the necessity to prioritise conservation actions in order to avoid deterioration of protected areas. To this aim, in the present study the most representative habitats of the Italian Alps are compared on the basis of vascular plant biodiversity and a conservation priority index is proposed for each habitat taking into account the potential distribution of 252 threatened vascular plant species. Rocky slopes, screes and alpine grasslands resulted to have the greatest percentage of endemic plant species so reflecting the general distributional pattern of endemic plant species at high altitudes in Eurasian mountains. The relationship between the conservation priority index and the corresponding habitat extent within the Natura 2000 network suggests that peatlands, arid grasslands, wet meadows and freshwater habitats deserve a higher priority in conservation actions. Although vascular plant biodiversity is not necessarily a surrogate of overall biodiversity of Alpine habitats, the results here reported can be used as an initial reference framework for prioritising conservation actions, so as to accomplish the provisions of Article 6 of Habitats Directive...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Establishment of {{reference}} sites for biomonitoring water quality assessment network {{is an essential}} component of a national biomonitoring programme. The use of biomonitoring has increased tremendously {{over the last few years}} with the realization by water quality managers that water is only but a component of a complex ecosystem made up of both biotic and abiotic factors. This paper gives an account of activities that were carried out during the establishment {{of reference}} sites for biomonitoring water quality assessment network in Zimbabwe. The initial stage was actually coming up with the relevant <b>bio-geographical</b> <b>regions</b> but as a result of insufficient biological data, ecoregions based on the climate, hydrology, geology and land use were used. The next stage was to identify least impacted sites using the catchment boundaries within the ecoregions as sub-regions, termed ecoregion level. After identifying the sites samples were collected in two sample runs. The samples were then identified to family level and thus reference samples were housed at the Laboratory whilst the identical set was sent to the Bulawayo museum for validation. The data collected underwent Multivariate analysis using Minitab software. About thirty three reference sites were established in the study area, Manyame Catchment within the Central Ecoregion [...] PROJECT BACKGROUND The history of surface water assessment based on biological indicators of pollution started more than a century ago with Kalenati (1848) and Cohn (1853). These workers observed that organisms that occur in polluted water were different from organisms that occur in clean water.

40|$|Efforts to {{conserve}} biodiversity in the European Union are strongly directed towards {{the protection of}} habitats and species through the designation of protected areas under the Habitats Directive. Biodiversity {{is essential to the}} supply of ecosystem services so conservation efforts towards biodiversity have also the potential to deliver benefits for people (Naidoo et al. 2008). However, this potential is poorly explored across Europe (Harrison et al. 2010). Recently, the conservation status of Europe’s protected habitats protected under the Habitats Directive was systematically assessed across 25 Member States and for 7 terrestrial and 4 marine <b>bio-geographical</b> <b>regions</b> (European Commission 2009). Here we demonstrate that terrestrial habitats in a favourable conservation status are predicted to provide more biodiversity and ecosystem services than habitats in an unfavourable conservation status. We mapped biodiversity across Europe using three proxies: Mean Species Abundance (MSA), a biodiversity indicator used in regional and global assessments (Alkemade 2009), forest tree species diversity and the relative area of protected sites that constitute the Natura 2000 network. Furthermore, our results show a positive, saturating spatial relationship between Mean Species Abundance (MSA), and Total Ecosystem Service Value (TESV), corresponding to the sum of 10 standardized proxies for the spatial distribution of ecosystem services across Europe. We present evidence that this relationship is the result of spatial tradeoffs between ecosystem services where MSA relates positively to regulating services delivered by forests and wetlands but negatively to crop and livestock production capacity provided by agro-ecosystems. Our findings demonstrate that a conservation approach to biodiversity is expected to result in synergies with an ecosystem based approach to support the provision of ecosystem services. This information is of importance to identify regions where measures are likely to result in cost effective progress towards both new biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services targets adopted by Convention of Biological Diversity and the European UnionJRC.

These {{serves as a}} foundation for the thematic groups developing the corresponding INSPIRE specifications. The aim {{of this study is to}} test a data harmonization approach to make Swedish environmental geodata and metadata compliant with these specifications. In the harmonization process, we use offline transformations that are split into one spatial and one non-spatial part, and standardized formats to allow vendor neutrality. Moreover, we extend the compliance tests to the data and metadata specifications by validating against both eXtensible Markup Language (XML) -schema and Schematron. Finally, we identify harmonization processes that may be costly or have negative impacts on data quality. The harmonized data and metadata are thereafter published as network services compliant with OGC Web Service specifications. The output from our method is data and metadata that are valid to the Nature-SDIplus data specifications and metadata profiles. Although the usage of standardized formats facilitates vendor neutrality, the nonspatial transformation procedures expressed in interoperable languages seem to be insufficient to execute all the mapping rules. Therefore, some of these transformations cannot be executed in a vendor neutral environment without modifications. Furthermore, by splitting the harmonization into two manageable parts, we avoid some limitations about XML schema translations in existing spatial transformation tools. Additional findings are: (1) by extending the validation with Schematron tests, we find non-compliances that have been missed during the XML schema tests; (2) costly processes are identified, which are caused by missing elements and by unstructured information given as comments; and (3) degradation of the positional and thematic accuracy occur during the harmonization...|$|E
