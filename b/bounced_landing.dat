50|$|On 22 July 2008, Boeing 727 C-GLKF Operated by Kelowna Flightcraft for Purolator Courier {{sustained}} {{minor damage}} during a <b>bounced</b> <b>landing</b> at Hamilton Airport. http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20080722-0.|$|E
50|$|It {{was known}} that {{detecting}} a <b>bounced</b> <b>landing</b> in a MD-11 {{was hard to}} recognize. The final report made several recommendations to improve training, procedures and flight instruments to help crews to deal with bounced landings.|$|E
50|$|Before this accident, {{there were}} 29 other bounced or severe hard {{landings}} with MD-11 aircraft that caused substantial damage. A similar accident had occurred on FedEx Express Flight 80 {{in the previous}} year, where both crew members {{were killed in a}} <b>bounced</b> <b>landing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|If {{the first}} or second <b>bounce</b> <b>lands</b> outside of the court, the last person who touched the ball is out. Normally called as 'out'.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the first}} <b>bounce</b> <b>lands</b> in another player's square, the player has 'fulled' or has hit a 'full'. They are out. In some variations, {{if the other}} player hits the full, it is called a 'full play' and they are out.|$|R

5000|$|The aircraft, named Joshua by FedEx, {{construction}} number 48603 {{and line}} number 553, was a McDonnell Douglas MD-11F freight model, powered by three General Electric CF6-80C2D1F engines. Registered in the United States as [...] the aircraft was delivered new to FedEx in September 1993. Prior to the crash, the aircraft {{had a total}} of 13,034 flight hours and 2,950 flight cycles (a flight cycle {{is defined as a}} takeoff and landing), and had been involved in two prior incidents. In January 1994, when it sustained underbelly damage during a <b>bounced</b> <b>landing</b> at Memphis International Airport. Then in November 1994, the aircraft was involved in a tailstrike at Anchorage International Airport. Permanent repairs were made from the Anchorage incident within days of the tailstrike, and permanent repairs to the Memphis incident were made at the next C check in August 1995.|$|E
50|$|The plane made a heavy touchdown, <b>bounced</b> and <b>landed</b> {{back on the}} runway, then skidded {{down the}} runway in flames, coming to rest inverted, 1900 feet from the runway {{threshold}} and 200 feet to the left.|$|R
5000|$|Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, {{suffered}} hard <b>landing,</b> <b>bounced</b> {{three times}} before overran the runway and crashed.|$|R
50|$|December 21, 1971 - an Islander, N589JA, with 1 {{crew and}} 7 {{passengers}} crashed at Culebra airport. Upon <b>landing,</b> The aircraft <b>bounced</b> on <b>landing.</b> The pilot initiated a go-around over hills. The aircraft {{was unable to}} clear a house and crashed.|$|R

2500|$|On 16 June 1948, KLM Douglas DC-4 (PH-TCF, [...] "Friesland") landed {{short of}} the runway, <b>bounced</b> and <b>landed</b> hard on the runway at Schiphol Airport due to pilot error. All 27 {{passengers}} and crew survived. The pilot had come in too low and too slow.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} modulation of pre- activity related to different types and heights of deep jump. Sixteen male soccer players without experience in deep jumps training (the national competition; 15. 0 ± 0. 5 yrs; weight 61. 9 ± 6. 1 kg; height 1. 77 ± 0. 07 m), who participated in the study, performed three types of deep jump (<b>bounce</b> <b>landing,</b> counter <b>landing,</b> and <b>bounce</b> drop jump) from three different heights (40 cm, 60 cm, and 80 cm). Surface EMG device (1000 Hz) was used to estimate muscle activity (maximal amplitude of EMG - AmaxEMG; integral EMG signal - iEMG) of five muscles (mm. gastrocnemii, m. soleus, m. tibialis anterior, m. vastus lateralis) within 150 ms before touchdown. All the muscles, except m. gastrocnemius medialis, showed systematic increase in pre-activity when platform height was raised. For most of the lower extremity muscles, the most significant differences were between values of pre-activity obtained for 40 cm and 80 cm platforms. While the amount of muscle pre-activity in deep jumps from the heights above and beneath the optimal one did not differ significantly from that generated in deep jumps from the optimal drop height of 60 cm, the patterns of muscle pre-activity obtained for the heights above the optimal one did differ from those obtained for the optimal drop height. That suggests that deep jumps from the heights above the optimal one do not seem to be an adequate exercise for adjusting muscle activity for the impact. Muscle pre-activity in bounce drop jumps differed significantly from that in counter <b>landing</b> and <b>bounce</b> <b>landing</b> respectively, which should indicate that a higher amount of pre-activity generated during bounce drop jumps was used for performing take-offs. As this study included the subjects who were not familiar with deep jumps training, the prospective studies should reveal the results of athletes with previous experienc...|$|R
2500|$|After {{its first}} flight on October 18, 1936, Hawks flew [...] "Time Flies", from Hartford, Connecticut to Miami, Florida on April 13, 1937, in 4 hours and 55 minutes. He then flew to Newark Airport, New Jersey, in 4 hours and 21 minutes, but <b>bounced</b> on <b>landing</b> at Newark, and broke a wooden spar {{in the right}} wing with other spars also damaged.|$|R
50|$|SATA had {{two major}} {{incidents}} with its aircraft. On July 17, 1973, while landing at Tromsø/Langnes Airport in Norway, a Convair CV-640 <b>landed</b> heavily, <b>bounced,</b> and <b>landed</b> back nose-down, resting 15m {{short of the}} runway end. On December 18, 1977, SA de Transport Aérien Flight 730 a Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle 10R crashed into the sea while on final approach to Funchal Airport in Portugal, killing 36.|$|R
50|$|The Alpha Omega Suspension System was {{developed}} to a customer specification {{as a replacement for}} existing bungee landing gear shocks used on aircraft. The customer noted that the traditional shocks leak and wear out as well as provide too much <b>bounce</b> upon <b>landing.</b> Roger's design employs solid polymer as the shock-absorber, housed in a steel-plated cylinder that is sealed with epoxy and mounted with titanium tubes.|$|R
50|$|If {{an attempt}} {{is made to}} pocket a ball, and the ball hits the pocket, <b>bounces</b> out and <b>lands</b> on the ground, the ball {{is placed in the}} pocket and the game continues.|$|R
5000|$|Hard {{courts are}} {{generally}} considered to be the best surface for an offensive baseliner who often hit higher risk shots. However, offensive baseliners can often excel on both grass and clay courts as well. On grass, they can execute their [...] "winners" [...] and the fast, low bounce makes it harder for opponents to retrieve; whereas on clay courts, some offensive baseliners might like the slow and high bounce because it gives them a longer time to change their grip and foot-positions in order to set up for an offensive shot or winner. Offensive baseliners with height especially have an advantage on clay courts because the high <b>bounces</b> <b>land</b> in their hitting zones, allowing them to strike the ball cleanly and more powerfully. One great example for this is Maria Sharapova, who is 6'2", and the high bounce of the ball really helps her produce winners and force errors from her opponents. She had the hardest hit backhand at the 2013 French Open from the women's side, when she punished a first serve from Jelena Jankovic, producing a backhand return winner.|$|R
50|$|The ball {{composition}} {{is made of}} different types of Polyurethane covered in Lycra, allowing it to bounce on water and float. Its patented design and durability gives Waboba its quality. To bounce the ball on the water, one must throw like skipping a rock. The ball bounces high on the water in between players when thrown at the right angle (overhand) with the right force.1 The ball does not <b>bounce</b> on <b>land.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tootle and Katy Caboose escape getting flattened, but {{the rock}} pushing {{down on the}} track holds them back. After {{everybody}} gets back on board does Tootle start making a run for it. The rock then chases the friends down the track, creating a trail of destruction behind it. Almost to Harbortown, the rock <b>bounces</b> and <b>lands</b> in Scuffy's bathtub car (Scuffy is safely {{out of the way}} in Saggy Baggy Elephant's car).|$|R
50|$|Invented by Patrick Camblin, the Bread & Butter {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as the first combo move. The paddler completes a Pan Am and uses the <b>bounce</b> created from <b>landing</b> the move to throw a backstab or possibly back Pan Am.|$|R
60|$|The {{monoplane}} was returning, {{for a time}} {{apparently not}} moving, like a black mark painted on the great blue sky; then soaring overhead, the sharply cut outlines clear as a pen-and-ink drawing; then <b>landing,</b> <b>bouncing</b> on the slightly uneven ground.|$|R
5000|$|Seat Landing Half Twist to Seat Landing or Swivel Hips [...] - [...] Performing a seat <b>landing,</b> <b>bounce</b> up to a {{straight}} position (without landing) and then perform a half twist and {{land in the}} second seat landing facing in the opposite direction.|$|R
5000|$|Fönnekold claimed three United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) P-51 Mustang's on 31 August 1944. He was <b>bounced</b> on his <b>landing</b> {{approach}} at Ssaß-Budak by P-51 Mustang's. One of the [...]50 caliber projectiles penetrated his heart. Nevertheless, {{he landed}} his Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-6 (Werknnummer 441931—factory number) [...] "black 9" [...] before succumbing to his injury.|$|R
50|$|The Bomb {{was thrown}} at the envoy {{when he was}} talking with the people present. The bomb hit him on his stomach but did not explode on impact but <b>bounced</b> off and <b>landed</b> near the feet of the District {{commissioner}} where it exploded. Three people including a Police personnel were killed in the attack. Anwar Chowdhury was injured in the blast.|$|R
50|$|The special {{begins with}} the Madballs being sentenced to hard labour on their home planet, Orb, by its dictator, the evil Commander Wolfbreath. Orb is a planet {{inhabited}} entirely by balls, where music and the <b>bouncing</b> & <b>landing</b> of balls are banned. Wolfbreath and his goons, the Badballs, have taken over the planet and sentence the Madballs to make a bust of himself. The Madballs are the only surviving rock and roll band on Orb, as all the other bands have been destroyed by the Badballs. The Badballs seek to destroy the Madballs {{in the hopes of}} ridding Orb of all music forever. At the same time, Slobulus and Aargh work on a spaceship in the hopes of leaving from Orb.|$|R
50|$|Land's {{group is}} mainly {{concerned}} {{with the role of}} eye movement in human activities such as driving, music reading and ball games. In 2000 Land and a colleague reported their finding that within 200 milliseconds after a ball leaves a cricket bowler's hand, the best batsmen will take their eyes off the ball and look ahead {{to the point where they}} have calculated it will <b>bounce</b> (see also <b>Land</b> & McLeod (2000) in bibliography).|$|R
50|$|Aircraft {{recoveries}} {{were slow}} {{because of bad}} approaches in the gathering dusk. After four landed successfully, the fifth Avenger landed too far right and put both wheels into the gallery walkway with its tail fouling the flight deck. The flight deck crew was unable to move the Avenger; and the three remaining planes were running out of fuel in total darkness. Guadalcanal turned on the lights and urged the pilots to try landing {{on the left side}} of the flight deck. The nervous pilots came in too high, too fast, and too far to port until one of them desperately cut power, <b>bounced,</b> and <b>landed</b> inverted in the water off the port side. The plane guard destroyer rescued the three crewmen from the unsuccessful landing and the crewmen from the two remaining planes which were instructed to ditch.|$|R
25|$|However {{the twin}} cities had {{expected}} an assault by bombardment {{and prepared for}} it. The city moat was expanded to a width of 150 meter, forcing Yuan siege weapons to set up at a distance. In addition to reinforcing their walls with clay, they made netting screens ten centimeters thick and ten meters in length to cover them and dampen projectile impact. As a result, the Yuan siege weapons were both ineffective and inaccurate, and the few shots that did <b>land</b> <b>bounced</b> off the wall harmlessly.|$|R
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his life}} Fall {{suffered}} from retroperitoneal fibrosis which resulted in the loss of a kidney and a colon blockage. According to his wife his condition engendered a sense of fatalism as he departed for what turned out to be his final trip to Vietnam. [...] On 21 February 1967, while accompanying a company of the 1st Battalion 9th Marines on Operation Chinook II in the Street Without Joy, Thừa Thiên Province, Fall stepped on a <b>Bouncing</b> Betty <b>land</b> mine which killed both him and Gunnery Sergeant Byron G. Highland, a U.S. Marine Corps combat photographer. He was dictating notes into a tape recorder, which captured his last words: [...] "We've reached one of our phase lines after the firefight and it smells bad—meaning it's a little bit suspicious... Could be an amb—". Fall was survived by his wife and three daughters.|$|R
2500|$|On 21 November 1972, a Douglas EC-47Q, AF Ser. No. 43-49771 of the United States Air Force crashed {{killing two}} of the 10 people on board. The {{aircraft}} was operated by the 361st Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron, United States Air Force. It had flown a tactical mission under the call sign [...] "Baron 56", and had taken off at about 10:44 local time (03:44 UTC). At 17:00, the aircraft was returning from the mission when it <b>bounced</b> on <b>landing</b> and started to depart {{the left side of}} the runway. The pilot over-corrected, causing the aircraft to depart to the right of the runway. Although a go-around was initiated, the aircraft hit trees damaging the port propeller. The co-pilot considered that the starboard engine was failing and that engine's propeller was feathered. The aircraft then crashed into another bank of trees [...] beyond the end of the runway. The wrecked aircraft was destroyed in the post-crash fire.|$|R
50|$|Hypno-Disc was {{subsequently}} put {{through to the}} Grand Final, where it went up against Chaos 2. Chaos 2 had a fast start, circling Hypno-Disc, getting {{in a good position}} for a flip. However, Hypno-Disc seemed to be very sluggish and appeared to have control problems, but Chaos 2 decided not to immediately finish the battle and drove away. Chaos 2 then used its flipper unsuccessfully, <b>bouncing</b> and <b>landing</b> on Hypno-Disc's disc, temporarily stopping the disc. Chaos 2 managed to escape without any damage done, however Hypno-Disc was also able to get its disc up to speed again. However, as Hypno-Disc drove over the flame pit, Chaos 2 was able to drive in again and land the final blow, ironically, getting under Hypno-Disc to flip it over onto its back, and win the title. While Chaos 2 then took on the House robots, the defeated Hypno-Disc machine was dragged into the arena corner by Dead Metal, before cease was finally called.|$|R

50|$|By {{the early}} 2010s, black sitcoms had faded away on broadcast/network {{television}} (ABC, The CW, NBC, CBS, and FOX) {{but there are}} signs of a comeback on cable such as The Game, canceled in 2009 and then renewed on BET, A.N.T. Farm on Disney Channel, Are We There Yet?, Tyler Perry's For Better Or Worse on TBS, Love That Girl! on TV One, Let's Stay Together and Reed Between the Lines, on BET.

5000|$|In 1936, Hawks had {{approached}} Howell W. [...] "Pete" [...] Miller, chief engineer for the Granville Brothers and {{responsible for their}} famous Gee Bee racers, to create a racing aircraft from his own design, the Hawks Miller HM-1. With an advanced aircraft design that still relied heavily on wood construction, the HM-1 featured innovative design elements, including the unusual feature of [...] "burying" [...] the cockpit with a curved windshield contoured to fit the fuselage top, creating a very streamlined shape. The cockpit was extended for takeoff and landing, but retracted in flight, with the pilot's seat lowered and the windshield becoming flush with the fuselage. After its first flight on October 18, 1936, Hawks flew [...] "Time Flies", from Hartford, Connecticut to Miami, Florida on April 13, 1937, in 4 hours and 55 minutes. He then flew to Newark Airport, New Jersey, in 4 hours and 21 minutes, but <b>bounced</b> on <b>landing</b> at Newark, and broke a wooden spar in the right wing with other spars also damaged.|$|R

The aircraft was renamed the Miller HM-2, but also when company was reorganized as the Miller Aircraft Co., it was called the MAC-1, the [...] "Hawks Military Racer" [...] and Military Aircraft HM-1. With the intention to demonstrate the aircraft's potential, pilot Leigh Wade entered the MAC-1 in the 1938 Thompson Trophy race. In essentially military configuration with dummy machine guns fitted, Wade flew the aircraft to a fourth-place finish.|$|R
