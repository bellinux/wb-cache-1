40|$|The present work {{reports the}} {{technical}} analysis of bioethanol production from lignocellulosic residues like empty fruit <b>brunches,</b> rice husks & sugar cane bagasse. The ethanol production was figured utilizing aspen plus. The {{composition of the}} three feedstocks i. e empty fruit <b>brunches,</b> rice husks and sugarcane baggase were required for simulation which was collected from the literature study and web. This process of producing bioethanol from lignocellulosic residues is more economical than producing bioethanol from maize or sugar cane. Among the three lignocellulosic residues considered Rice husk and Empty fruit <b>brunches</b> are cheaper compared to sugarcane baggase and have high yield value of ethanol i. e 0. 52 and 0. 38 respectively. However the sugarcane baggase are comparatively costlier and have low yield value of ethanol.

Jacques proves to be a patient and charming instructor - the opposite of Homer in every way. When he asks about the name inscribed on her ball, she tells him that Homer is actually the ball's name, neglecting to mention that she is married. Homer is faintly aware that something is wrong, but is unsure what is happening. After passing several bowling lessons, Jacques and Marge agree to meet each other for <b>brunch.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK <b>Brunch</b> product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.|$|E

40|$|Shapere and Wilczek {{recently}} found some singular Lagrangian systems which spontaneously breaks time translation symmetry. The common feature of their models {{is that the}} energy functions are multivalued {{in terms of the}} canonical phase space variables and the symmetry breaking ground states are all located at the <b>brunching</b> point singularities. By enlarging the phase space and making use of Dirac's theory on constrained Hamiltonian systems, we present the Hamiltonian description of some of the models discussed by Shapere and Wilczek and found that both the multivaluedness and the <b>brunching</b> point singularities can be avoided, while the spontaneous breaking oftime translation becomes more transparent. It is also shown that the breaking of time translation is always accompanied by the breaking of time reversal. Comment: 13 page...|$|R
