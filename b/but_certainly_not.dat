5|$|France and Austria {{signed a}} truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter {{out of the}} war. Austria agreed to {{recognize}} French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities, and Venice {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.|$|E

25|$|In Scandinavia {{family names}} often, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> always, {{originate}} from a patronymic. Later on, {{people from the}} Scandinavian middle classes, particularly artisans and town dwellers, adopted surnames {{in a similar fashion}} to that of the gentry. Family names joining two elements from nature such as the Swedish Bergman ("mountain man"), Holmberg ("island mountain"), Lindgren ("linden branch"), Sandström ("sand stream") and Åkerlund ("field grove") were quite frequent and remain common today.|$|E
25|$|Foote {{was destined}} for the law, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> by nature. In his {{chambers}} at the Inner Temple, and in the Grecian Coffee House nearby, he came to know something of lawyers if not of law, and was afterwards able to jest at the jargon and to mimic the mannerisms of the bar, and to satirize the Latitats of the other branch of the profession with particular success. Though he never applied himself to his studies at the Inner Temple, he well applied himself to spending money and living as a bon vivant which led to him quickly running out of funds.|$|E

25|$|In Scandinavia, {{family names}} often, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> always, {{originate}} from a patronymic. In Denmark and Norway, the corresponding ending is -sen, as in Karlsen. Names ending with dotter/datter (daughter), such as Olofsdotter, are rare but occurring, and only apply to women. Today, the patronymic names are passed on similarly to family names in other Western countries, and a person's father {{does not have}} to be called Karl if he or she has the surname Karlsson. However, in 2006 Denmark reinstated patronymic and matronymic surnames as an option. Thus, parents Karl Larsen and Anna Hansen can name a son Karlssøn or Annasøn and a daughter Karlsdatter or Annasdatter.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Gee {{also argues}} that reading and writing {{should be viewed as}} more than just “mental achievements” {{happening}} inside people’s minds; they should also be seen as “social and cultural practices with economic, historical, and political implications”. So, in Gee’s view, literacies are not only multiple but are inherently connected to social practices. In order to expand the traditional view of literacy as print literacy, Gee recommends that we think first of literacy in terms of semiotic domains. By this, he means “any set of practices that recruits one or more modalities (e.g., oral or written language, images, equations, symbols, sounds, gestures, graphs, artifacts, etc.) to communicate distinctive types of meanings”. There is a seemingly endless and varied range of semiotic domains, including (<b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> limited to) cellular biology, first-person-shooter video games, rap music, or modernist painting. Most pundits would describe this conception of literacies as a key element in {{what has come to be}} known as the New Literacy Studies. In short, this theoretical and methodological orientation emphasizes studying language-in-use and literacies within their contexts of social practice. It includes work by colleagues such as Brian Street, Gunther Kress, David Barton, Mary Hamilton, Courtney Cazden, Ron Scollon, and Suzie Scollon, among others.|$|E
500|$|Bertrand Jeune, Jean-Marie Robine {{and colleagues}} {{compared}} Jeanne Calment {{with a list}} of nearly 20 people worldwide who had securely been verified to have attained at least 115 years of age. The researchers concluded that the lives of these people differed widely, and that there were but few common characteristics: the overwhelming majority were female (only two were male), most smoked little or not at all, and they had never been obese. They all seem to have had strong characters, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> all were domineering personalities. Although they aged slowly, all became very frail and their physical functions declined markedly, especially after their 105th birthdays. In their final years they required wheelchairs, and were nearly blind and deaf. [...] "But they did not fear death, and they appeared to be reconciled to the fact their lives would soon end".|$|E

500|$|However, in the Philippines, {{the courts}} have accorded the {{individual}} autonomy to decide what constitutes religious practice. It {{is up to the}} individual to decide what constitutes religious practice so long as such acts do not offend public interest. This was the view proffered in Ebralinag v. Superintendent of Schools of Cebu (1993), in which the issue was whether the petitioners, who were Jehovah's Witnesses, ought to be expelled from schools for refusing to salute the flag, sing the national anthem and recite the oath of allegiance as required by the Republic Act No. 1265 of 11 July 1955 and other legislation. Cruz J. held that the state could not interpret the Bible for the petitioners as [...] "only they can read it as they see fit. Right or wrong, the meaning they derive from it cannot be revised or reversed except perhaps by their own acknowledged superiors. <b>But</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> the State.

500|$|David Kronke of the Los Angeles Daily News {{wrote that}} the show [...] "returns to its wicked wit, dialing back <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> eradicating the melodrama." [...] He complimented the four main actresses for their comedic relief and concluded: [...] "Rarely does a show unjump the shark this well; it's back in fine form, {{calibrating}} its humor and its menace just right." [...] New York Daily News writer David Bianculli compared the premiere to the show's second season, noting that the episode showed [...] "an assurance and a knowing playfulness that was missing most of last year." [...] He complimented Cherry and Greenstein's script and approved the storylines for each character. Bianculli opined that the episode returned {{the quality of the}} show's first season and concluded: [...] "Pass the word: If you've given up on 'Desperate Housewives,' it's time to return to the neighborhood." [...] Entertainment Weekly Lindsay Soll identified Eva Longoria as the episode's strongest performer, declaring that she [...] "definitely looks like the one to watch this season." [...] Soll was glad to see that the Susan character was [...] "a little more toned down and less accident-prone than usual," [...] and called the scenes with Susan and Mike touching. Additionally, she opined that Laurie Metcalf [...] "did a brilliant job of playing the classic TV nosy neighbor," [...] but expressed her confusion over the Orson storyline.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to exploring {{the trials and}} tribulations of achieving the great American dream during the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby explores societal gender expectations as a theme, exemplifying in Daisy Buchanan's character the marginalization {{of women in the}} East Egg social class that Fitzgerald depicts. As an upper-class, white woman living in East Egg during this time period in America, Daisy must adhere to certain societal expectations, including <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> limited to actively filling the role of dutiful wife, mother, keeper of the house, and charming socialite. As the reader finds in the novel, many of Daisy's choices, ultimately culminating in the tragedy of the plot and misery for all those involved, can be at least partly attributed to her prescribed role as a [...] "beautiful little fool" [...] who is completely reliant on her husband for financial and societal security. For instance, one could argue that Daisy's ultimate decision to remain with her husband despite her feelings for Gatsby {{can be attributed to the}} status, security, and comfort that her marriage to Tom Buchanan provides. Additionally, the theme of the female familial role within The Great Gatsby goes hand in hand with that of the ideal family unit associated with the great American dream- a dream that goes unrealized for Gatsby and Daisy in Fitzgerald's prose.|$|E
