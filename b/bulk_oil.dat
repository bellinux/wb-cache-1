500|$|At {{the site}} of the Purton Hulks there is less than [...] of land between the river and the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal (or Gloucester and Berkeley Canal). The [...] canal was dug between Gloucester and Sharpness; for much of its length it runs close to the [...] tidal River Severn, but cuts off a {{significant}} loop in the river, at a once-dangerous bend near Arlingham. It was once the broadest and deepest canal in the world. Conceived in the Canal Mania period of the late 18th century, the Gloucester and Berkeley Ship Canal scheme was authorised by a 1793 Act of Parliament. The canal opened in April 1827, having cost £440,000 in the course of its construction. The flood plain of the Severn hereabouts is very flat and so the elevation of the canal does not require any rise over its length. Outside the dock areas at each end, there are no locks. This encouraged the use of the canal for ships larger than on most other British canals, although {{there were a number of}} swing bridges to negotiate. As opened the canal was [...] wide, [...] deep and could take craft of up to 600 tons. In 1905 traffic exceeded one million tons for the first time.

On well deck ships the lack of a continuous line of the deck, one the turret ship design solved with a continuous line and solid structure up to the top of the turret, resulted in weakness with classification societies taking notice by requiring increased strengthening in construction. The long, wide hatches were seen as making the design especially suitable for carrying heavy or bulky machinery. That feature later resulted in cargoes such as [...] long, [...] wide girders and a 110-ton gun being easily loaded.|$|E

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{activity of}} {{a new series of}} alkyl hydroxytyrosyl ethers was evaluated by the Rancimat test in a lipophilic food matrix and by the FRAP, ABTS and DPPH assays in a hydrophilic medium, and compared to free hydroxytyrosol (HTy), butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) and α-tocopherol. All methods used to assess the antioxidant activity of the new compounds emphasised the importance of the ortho-diphenolic structure on the maintenance of the high antioxidant activity associated with free HTy. The results obtained support the ‘polar paradox’ since the antioxidant activity of the lipophilic hydroxytyrosyl ethers was slightly lower in <b>bulk</b> <b>oils</b> and higher in hydrophilic media in comparison with their reference HTy. Although the length of the alkyl chain did not significantly affect the antioxidant activity in <b>bulk</b> <b>oils,</b> it did have a positive influence in hydrophilic medium for ethers with a short alkyl chain (methyl, ethyl and propyl), while ethers with longer alkyl chain (butyl, hexyl, octyl, dodecyl and octadecyl) maintained or even decreased their antioxidant activity, probably due to the steric effect of the side chains. In conclusion, these results show the strong antioxidant activity {{of a new}} group of lipophilic HTy derivatives that satisfies the food industry demands for new antioxidants with potential use as functional ingredients to improve the quality and nutritional properties of foods.

Unfortunately, the number of antioxidants available to food manufacturers to control oxidative rancidity is limited and the approval of new antioxidants is unlikely due to economic barriers in obtaining government approval for new food additives.
