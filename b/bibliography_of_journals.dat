50|$|As the {{institutions}} met {{to see if}} they had overlapping holdings—and cataloged records—the need for a shared solution became clear. Funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities was obtained to start a series of planning and organization meetings in October 1976. These meetings led to the publication of an initial planning study by the Association for Recorded Sound Collections that was conducted in 1978 along with Yale University's preliminary <b>bibliography</b> <b>of</b> <b>journals</b> that would be used in the project, also from 1978. One outcome of this process was the creation of Rules for Archival Cataloging of Sound Recordings, as traditional cataloging methods did not meet all of the needs for recorded sound. Another was the publication of A Discotopology Primer, that was used to guide cataloging and classification of the project.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{share the}} process {{used to enhance}} the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Annotated <b>bibliography</b> <b>of</b> <b>journals</b> for {{educational}} scholarship (Blanco & Love, 2016) with a quick reference chart of journal quality indicators. Setting: The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Annotated <b>bibliography</b> <b>of</b> <b>journals</b> for educational scholarship provides a valuable annotated list of journals suitable for medical educators to consider when publishing their work. This format is naturally heavily text-based and contains limited information about journal self-archiving policies and journal rankings. Brief Description: This list {{was transformed into a}} quick reference chart indicating MEDLINE indexing, Web of Science and Scopus quartile rankings, and the open access and/or self-archiving policy for each journal. The tools and process used to create this chart, the dissemination methodology, lessons learned and ideas for future projects are presented. Outcome: The Quality Indicators for Journals of Medical Education Scholarship is freely available from the university?s institutional repository, is linked in multiple LibGuides and is referenced by medical education faculty at the institution when selecting journals in which to publish. Conclusion: Turning up the heat on existing quality work can help your researchers see that the sky?s the limit for disseminating their scholarly work...|$|E
40|$|This chart is a {{companion}} to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Annotated <b>bibliography</b> <b>of</b> <b>journals</b> for educational scholarship (Berry, 2017). The chart gives a quick reference to help guide selection of a journal in which to publish medical education research. Questions addressed include: How easily can my audience find my work? How easily can I track impact, such as citations? Brief notes are given regarding tools to validate current information and links are given in the References (some may only be available through your institution). Journal indexing and publisher policies change regularly, so authors should always verify copyright, archiving, indexing and journal rankings with the publisher. Many fully open access titles listed {{will be eligible for}} institutional underwriting of publication charges. Contact your librarian for assistance with any of the tools listed...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{the field}} of Jewish law has gained {{increasing}} prominence in American law schools and legal scholarship. At the same time, {{in the realm of}} scholarship, a substantial body of literature has developed considering the relevance of Jewish legal thought to a variety of issues in the American legal system. As the substance, scope, and volume of this scholarship demonstrate, an analysis of Jewish law may prove helpful in providing comparisons and contrasts to both controversial and seemingly settled areas of American law. At the 2007 Annual Meeting of the Association of American Law Schools, the Section on Jewish Law presented a program exploring emerging applications of Jewish law in American legal scholarship.

The twentieth century is sketched with a timeline of discoveries that at the time were important and a <b>bibliography</b> <b>of</b> <b>journal</b> review articles. ResultsBy 1900 the avascular, aneural state and fibrillar composition have been accepted. The nutrition of articular cartilage remained in dispute. The composition of the binding substance and its relation to collagen remained unknown. Research {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century continued to be impeded by lack of technology. The advent of electron microscopy, isotopic tracer technics and enzymology rapidly accelerated the understanding of hyaline cartilage beginning in the 1950 s.

40|$|In the {{following}} {{paper we discuss}} changes to the <b>Bibliography</b> <b>of</b> <b>Journal</b> Contents that have occurred along the last five years.

Its creators actively make use of Internet resources themselves to create e. g. filing system that allows you to minimize errors in descriptions and facilitate editing process. Alteration to the information system, in which the database is being developed, forced transformation in the manner of indexing and as a consequence further changes in the bibliographic description. Access to the bibliography will be provided to the user in the same system that presents the remaining resources of the National Library, therefore further cooperation between the National Library and libraries creating Prasa database (Press database) will be developed. Furthermore, a brief review <b>of</b> similar <b>bibliographies</b> across the world was made.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{research activities}} related to the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) sky survey. About 745 luminous stars were examined {{for the presence of}} interstellar dust heated by a nearby star. The 'cirrus' discovered by IRAS is thermal radiation from interstellar dust at moderate and high galactic latitudes. The IRAS locates the dust which must (at some level) scatter ultraviolet starlight, although it was expected that thermal emission would be found around virtually every star, most stars shown no detectable emission. And the emission found is not uniform. It is not that the star is embedded in 'an interstellar medium', but rather what is found are discrete clouds that are heated by starlight. An exception is the dearth of clouds near the very hottest stars, implying that the very hottest stars play an active role with respect to destroying or substantially modifying the dust clouds over time. The other possibility is simply that the hottest stars are located in regions lacking in dust, which is counter-intuitive.

40|$|The use of {{acupuncture}} in inducing delivery has a {{long history}} in China. With progress over time, it has been applied in many aspects. For further study of acupuncture in delivery, this paper analyzed the papers using acupuncture in delivery in the past ten years in mainland China. 87 literatures were picked out by searching relevant electronic databases and <b>bibliographies</b> <b>of</b> relevant <b>journals.</b> The analysis showed randomized controlled trials that were the major type of research, while preclinical researches and literature reviews only account for around ten percent, respectively. Clinical researches indicated that acupuncture can relieve labor pain, promote maternal uterine contraction, shorten birth process, and treat postpartum disorders. Preclinical researches found that acupuncture can adjust certain hormones and improve uterus contraction of late-stage pregnant rats. However, due to lack of large multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials, standardized evaluations of clinical effects in clinical researches and detailed mechanism study in preclinical researches and unequivocal conclusions about the effectiveness, efficacy, and mechanisms of acupuncture in this field cannot be obtained from those researches yet.
