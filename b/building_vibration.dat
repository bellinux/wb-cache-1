40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the subjective response to railway-induced <b>building</b> <b>vibration.</b> No previous study has obtained both subjective and objective measures from so many lineside residents: several hundred were interviewed and over fifty of the dwellings provided a site for a continuous 24 hour recording of <b>building</b> <b>vibration.</b> Annoyance caused by railway-induced <b>building</b> <b>vibration,</b> and the factors affecting annoyance, were investigated in a social survey. Of a sample of 720 adults living within 100 metres of railway lines in Scotland, 459 were interviewed; 160 of these noticed railway-induced <b>building</b> <b>vibration.</b> It is estimated that 1. 4 % of adults in Scotland notice railway-induced <b>building</b> <b>vibration.</b> Vibration was found to be amongst the least annoying aspects of a railway's presence in a neighbourhood. Vibration was recorded in 52 dwellings for 24 hours continuously in three axes. A method of isolating the portions of the 24 hour acceleration time-histories which represented perceptible railway-induced <b>building</b> <b>vibration</b> was developed. The severities of the isolated periods of the acceleration time-histories were assessed by 90 alternative measures chosen using the results of laboratory experiments. These had suggested that a vibration dose value (incorporating a fourth power relationship) was the most appropriate measure. The 90 measures were formed from combinations of different frequency weightings, time dependencies, averaging procedures and summing methods. Within-building differences in frequency and severity of vibration were found and differences occurred between similar, neighbouring, buildings. Frequency of vibration was influenced primarily by the characteristics of the building or the ground, rather than those of the passing trains. Horizontal vibration was generally below perception thresholds. The effect of different integration times used in root mean square averaging was demonstrated. No clear relationship was found between distance from the railway and severity of <b>building</b> <b>vibration.</b> Subjective response was found to be influenced primarily by the number of trains passing in 24 hours but not significantly affected by any of the characteristics of the vibration. It is concluded that this arose because railway-induced <b>building</b> <b>vibration</b> did not cause significant annoyance within the sample population. This conclusion does not deny the existence of individuals who were annoyed, or of individuals whose annoyance was influenced by the characteristics of the vibration. The conclusion that railway-induced <b>building</b> <b>vibration</b> did not cause significant annoyance within the sample population could not have been obtained from the questionnaire data alone. This demonstrates the importance of obtaining both objective and subjective measures when investigating subjective response to phenomena such as <b>building</b> <b>vibration...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{simulate}} an earthquake shock originating from the earthquake source {{and the damage}} it causes to buildings, not only the seismic wave that propagates over a wide region of several 100 km 2, but also the <b>building</b> <b>vibrations</b> that occur over a small region of several 10 m 2 must be resolved concurrently. Such a multi-scale simulation is difficult because such kind of modeling and implementation by only a specific application are limited.

40|$|Because {{of rapid}} urbanization, {{more and more}} {{buildings}} are constructed closer to roadsides {{than they used to}} be. This gives rise to some environmental problems, for traffic-induced ground vibration deteriorates the human comfort in neighbouring buildings and affects the normal operation of nearby high-tech facilities. This paper presents a framework for quantifying traffic-induced <b>building</b> <b>vibration</b> in a stochastic way. Vehicle distribution along a roadway is first simulated based on vehicle spacing distribution and vehicle-type distribution. In consideration of buildings in proximity to the roadway, not only Rayleigh waves but also body waves induced by moving vehicle forces are included in the determination of the frequency-response function of a half-space. The combination of the moving force spectra with the frequency-response function of the half-space then leads to evolutionary ground spectra. The framework further provides a method for deriving the evolutionary spectra of a building to the evolutionary ground spectra. The proposed framework is finally applied to a typical three-dimensional high-tech facility, in which the effects of both a single heavy truck and a two-way traffic flow on <b>building</b> <b>vibration</b> are investigated. The results show that traffic-induced ground vibration impedes the normal operation of the high-tech facility. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis work {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the multiple interactions between soil layers and civil-engineering structures in dense urban areas submitted to a seismic wave. To investigate such phenomena, called site-city interaction (sci) herein, two simplified site-city configurations are considered: a homogeneous, periodically spaced city and a heterogeneous, nonperiodically spaced city, both on a constant- depth basin model. These 2 D boundary-element method models are subjected to a vertically incident plane SH Ricker wavelet. A parametric study of the city parameters (density of buildings and their natural frequencies) and the thickness of the basin is carried out to characterize the sci and to investigate its sensitivity to some governing parameters. The following parameters are analyzed: <b>building</b> <b>vibrations,</b> induced ground motion, ground-motion perturbations inside and outside the city, spatial coherency, and kinetic energy of the "urban wave field.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the annoyance caused by railway-induced <b>building</b> <b>vibration</b> and railway noise. A review of previous studies was conducted to examine current knowledge. The review enabled identification of areas in which there was insufficient information on which to base a prediction of the reaction to railway vibration and noise in buildings. Deficiencies in current knowledge formed the basis of a programme of experimental work which was conducted to investigate how the annoyance produced by railway-induced <b>building</b> <b>vibration</b> is affected by the number of trains, the vibration magnitude, the vibration frequency, the direction of vibration and the presence of noise. Two laboratory experiments were concerned with how annoyance caused by railway-induced <b>building</b> <b>vibration</b> depends on the magnitude of vibration and on how often trains pass. A trade-off was determined between the number of trains and the vibration magnitude which indicated a fourth power relation between magnitude and duration. The relation supports the use of the vibration dose value as a method of vibration assessment. Two further experiments were conducted to determine the subjective equivalence of noise and vibration and to investigate the interaction and combined effects of the two stimuli. The results suggest that vibration does not influence the assessment of noise but that the assessment of vibration can be increased or reduced by the presence of noise, depending on the relative magnitudes of the vibration and noise. A fifth experiment was performed to investigate the influence on annoyance of vibration frequency, vibration magnitude and vibration direction. Vibration frequency weightings were determined to describe subjective response to whole-body vibration at low magnitudes such as occurs in buildings. The results indicate that the weightings in British Standard 6841 (1987) provide a reasonable approximation to the frequency dependence of response to whole-body vibration at low magnitudes. In the final experiment the previous findings were combined to provide a general method of predicting the relative annoyance from complex conditions of railway vibration and noise. The method was shown to provide a more accurate prediction of the relative annoyance from railway vibration and noise than methods based on the influence of noise or vibration alone...|$|E

40|$|<b>Building</b> <b>vibration</b> {{has become}} one of the major {{concerns}} to structural engineers. Being a vibration absorber, a tuned liquid column damper (TLCD) not only suppresses <b>building</b> <b>vibration,</b> but also acts as the water storage facility of a building. In view of this, the application Of Such damper is particularly suited for building structures. However, due to inherent nonlinear liquid damping, it is no doubt that a great deal of computational effort is required to search the optimum parameters of TLCD numerically. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a closed form solution scheme of TLCD-structure systems and the optimum parameters of TLCD that lead to the maximum vibration reduction of building structure, so as to facilitate the design of dampers. The developed closed form solution of TLCD-structure system is verified by comparing results obtained from the conventional iterative method. After having a satisfactory verification, the existence of the invariant points of a TLCD-structure system for the case of undamped primary structure is demonstrated. Explicit design formulas of TLCD for the case of undamped primary structures are obtained by optimizing the response at the two invariant points. The optimum parameters of TLCD for the case of damped primary structures are also investigated numerically. An approach for determining the optimum head loss coefficient of TLCD is proposed. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the design procedures of TLCD for suppressing harmonic type vibrations (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
