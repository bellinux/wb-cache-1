There's so much stepping on the backs of other people in our profession. We've been so lucky that we've never had to do that.

500|$|We {{achieved}} {{what we did}} on a low budget {{because we}} carefully planned the whole production in advance of starting the cameras. [...] Thus, when we moved into the studio for fifteen days of scheduled shooting, we didn't have to start making decisions. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> pre-production conferences with director of photography Floyd Crosby and art director Daniel Haller, everyone knew exactly what to do, barring any last minute inspirations on the set.|$|E

At a rally at Shivaji Park, he said, [...] "That north Indians are living in Mumbai is <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> mercy. Let it be known". He told MNS leaders to shed their complacence and advised his supporters to [...] "take action" [...] whenever they felt necessary. He warned that North Indians who did not speak Marathi and did not respect Marathi culture would be driven away. Raj dared the police in his speech by saying, [...] "Arrest me for this if you can". After analysing the speech amidst demand for action against the MNS chief a senior police official quoted it was [...] "difficult to find an explicit threat or provocation" [...] {{in the text of}} his speech to initiate strong legal action against him and [...] "it seems he [...] consulted legal experts before making the speech".|$|E
500|$|The brief [...] "Sea Song" [...] of 1907 was {{an early}} attempt by Grainger to write [...] "beatless" [...] music. This work, {{initially}} set over 14 irregular bars and occupying about 15 seconds of performing time, was a forerunner of Grainger's free-music experiments of the 1930s. Grainger wrote: [...] "It seems to me absurd {{to live in an}} age of flying, and yet not be able to execute tonal glides and curves". The idea of tonal freedom, he said, had been in his head since as a boy of eleven or twelve he had observed the wave-movements in the sea. [...] "Out in nature we hear all kinds of lovely and touching [...] "free" [...] (non-harmonic) combinations of tones; yet we are unable to take up these beauties... into the art of music <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> archaic notions of harmony." [...] In a 1941 letter to Scott, Grainger acknowledged that he had failed to produce any large-scale works {{in the manner of a}} Bach oratorio, a Wagner opera or a Brahms symphony, but excused this failure on the grounds that all his works before the mid-1930s had been mere preparations for his free music.|$|E
500|$|The England Test was the All Blacks' third {{international}} {{in as many}} weeks; they had been played on successive Saturdays, with a mid-week match between each. England named eight new caps in their side, and played a rover (or wing-forward) on top of seven forwards. The game {{has been described as}} [...] "a benefit for All Black wing Duncan McGregor". He scored four tries in the Test—a record not equalled by an All Black until 1987. A try was also scored by Fred Newton, and with none of the five tries converted, the score finished 15–0. English sportsman C. B. Fry said after the match, [...] "The notion that these men beat us <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> physical degeneracy is nonsense. They beat us by organisation and by tactics." [...] A legacy of this match is that the whistle used by the referee, Gil Evans, has been used to start the opening match of every Rugby World Cup tournament. Between tournaments the whistle is housed at the New Zealand Rugby Museum in Palmerston North and was donated to them by the chairman of the NZRFU and manager of the 1924–25 All Blacks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{structural}} determinism, or how [...] "the structure of legal thought or culture influences its content," [...] is {{a mode of}} thought or widely shared practice which determines significant social outcomes.

2500|$|Textbooks and encyclopedias were {{a booming}} {{business}} in 1959. While general books accounted for $408 million in sales, textbooks and encyclopedias totaled $597 million. Crowell's subsidiary P. F. Collier and Sons published the Collier's Encyclopedia and released a new 24-volume set in 1962. Since 1909 it also published the 51-volume Harvard Classics, {{an anthology of}} classic and world literature. The company expanded the line of encyclopedias by announcing that it would use the resources of Crowell-Collier, Macmillian and Free Press to begin work on a new multi-volume set on social sciences. W. Allen Wallis, named chairman of the editorial board for the encyclopedia said, [...] "In {{the past few years}} we have stressed the physical sciences <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> concern for defense, and the biological sciences <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> interest in better health.
