25|$|One of {{the best}} known is Miguel Santiago, who sells about forty pieces a year. Some of these sales are {{individual}} pieces and others are multiple sets such as Frida Kalo surrounded by monkeys. Sets are usually sold to foreign buyers for between $300 and $800 USD and have been sent to Europe, Japan and the United States. Sets often take more than a month to make and his work is considered to be in {{the high end of the}} market. Santiago’s orders extend more than two years in advance. Santiago used to work with a brother and later with a nephew, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>he</b> works mostly solo with his father to help. Another {{of the best}} known is one of the few female entrepreneurs in the market, Olga Santiago. She does not carve or paint, rather she hires others to do the work while she administrates. However, she signs all the pieces. Many of her carvers and painters are young men who leave quickly to form workshops of their own. While her workshop is not the only one run in this manner, hers is the newest and most successful. Olga’s client base is tourists, which are often brought to her by tour guides, taxi drivers and the like for a commission, and wholesalers.|$|E
500|$|Doctor 'Doc' Doccerson (instead of Reubens in the PSP version), is infuriated {{that all}} of his inventions failed, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>he</b> 'shall surpass them all' with his latest invention, C.R.U.S.H. He uses a tape {{recorder}} for his scientific narrative on the experiment. With {{the help of his}} best friend and protégé, Danny (a running gag consists of him correcting Doc throughout the game), he enters his mind as his subject to C.R.U.S.H., but after a few tests, Danny is trapped inside C.R.U.S.H., where he can collect his lost marbles (which will unlock new dressing gowns/robe designs) and facing his fears in the form of monsters (i.e. cockroaches, slugs). At one point, Doc tells Danny that C.R.U.S.H. will not let Danny out due to [...] "unresolved feelings." [...] The two question that reasoning as they progress. Towards the end, C.R.U.S.H. interrupts contact between Danny and Doc, overly infatuated with Danny. Danny slowly admits to C.R.U.S.H. that she is simply a machine and compares it to [...] "flirting with a parking meter." [...] C.R.U.S.H., infuriated, sends Danny back to his childhood as a result. When Doc comes back into contact with Danny, Danny lashes out at Doc for building a machine [...] "with the heart of a teenage girl" [...] who [...] "LOLd" [...] at him. Doc, calming Danny down, explains how this [...] "subconscious" [...] is not really his, but old data, and suddenly Danny becomes shocked when he realizes he took the place of someone who underwent treatment with C.R.U.S.H. (being the PSP Danny), but [...] "she knows [...] not the same." [...] C.R.U.S.H. really wanted Danny to clear her head. In the ending, Danny finally escapes and is free out of C.R.U.S.H's mind. He and Doc discuss C.R.U.S.H's future, while Doc says that he'll fix her. In a sudden plot twist, it turns out that they were not in the real world at all, but all the levels throughout the game are outside Doc's lab. C.R.U.S.H. smiles and laughs into the camera, she winks and the screen cuts to black.|$|E
2500|$|Canadian {{ecologist}} Patrick Moore, {{a former}} Greenpeace founding member, is {{a critic of}} the organization. In addition, Patrick Moore had once spoken out against nuclear power in 1976, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>he</b> supports it, along with renewable energy sources. In Australian newspaper The Age, he writes [...] "Greenpeace is wrong — we must consider nuclear power". He argues that any realistic plan to reduce reliance on fossil fuels [...] or greenhouse gas emissions need increased use of nuclear energy. [...] Phil Radford, Executive Director of Greenpeace US responded that nuclear energy is too risky and takes too long to build to address climate change. Radford asserts that the U.S. can shift to nearly 100% renewable energy while phasing out nuclear power by 2050.|$|E

60|$|The anthropoids were idling {{about the}} clearing, the first keen {{desire of the}} morning's hunger having been satisfied. Numa scented them long before he saw them. Ordinarily he would have turned away in search of other game, for even Numa {{respected}} the mighty muscles and the sharp fangs of the great bulls of the tribe of Kerchak, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>he</b> kept on steadily toward them, his bristled snout wrinkled into a savage snarl.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>today</b> <b>he</b> {{had noticed}} {{from the moment}} he had got out of bed that {{something}} was amiss with the world.

60|$|At {{the first}} net Norris was batting to the bowling of Gosling, a long, thin day boy, Gethryn, and the {{professional}}--as useful a trio as any school batsman could wish for. Norris was {{captain of the}} team this year, a sound, stylish bat, with a stroke after the manner of Tyldesley between cover and mid-off, which used to make Miles the professional almost weep with joy. <b>But</b> <b>today</b> <b>he</b> had evidently not quite got into form. Twice in successive balls Gosling knocked his leg stump {{out of the ground}} with yorkers, and the ball after that, Gethryn upset his middle with a beauty.|$|E
60|$|Father Brown, {{touching}} other people, was as sensitive as a barometer; <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>he</b> {{seemed about}} as sensitive as a rhinoceros. By no social law, rigid or implied, {{could he be}} supposed to linger round the lunch of the Anglo-Indian friends; but he lingered, covering his position with torrents of amusing but quite needless conversation. He was the more puzzling {{because he did not}} seem to want any lunch. As one after another of the most exquisitely balanced kedgerees of curries, accompanied with their appropriate vintages, were laid before the other two, he only repeated {{that it was one of}} his fast-days, and munched a piece of bread and sipped and then left untasted a tumbler of cold water. His talk, however, was exuberant.|$|E
60|$|Trevor {{opened the}} {{notebook}} {{and began to}} read what he had written. He finished the paragraph which owed its insertion to Clowes, and raced hurriedly on to the next. To his surprise the flippancy passed unnoticed, at any rate, verbally. As a rule the headmaster preferred that quotations from back numbers of Punch should be kept out of the prefects' English Essays. And he generally said as much. <b>But</b> <b>today</b> <b>he</b> seemed strangely preoccupied. A split infinitive in paragraph five, which at other times would have made him sit up in his chair stiff with horror, elicited no remark. The same immunity was accorded to the insertion (inspired by Clowes, as usual) of a popular catch phrase in the last few lines. Trevor finished with the feeling that luck had favoured him nobly.|$|E

Tarzan scratched his head, running his fingers deep into the shock of black hair which framed his shapely, boyish face--he scratched his head and sighed. Teeka's new-found beauty became as suddenly his despair. He envied her the handsome coat of hair which covered her body. His own smooth, brown hide he hated with a hatred born of disgust and contempt. Years back he had harbored a hope that some day he, too, would be clothed in hair as were all his brothers and sisters; but of late he had been forced to abandon the delectable dream.|$|R
