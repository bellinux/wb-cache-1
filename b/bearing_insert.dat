30|$|The {{choice between}} mobile and fixed bearing depends {{partially}} on the surgeon’s preference. The potential for accelerated polyethylene wear, when performing an ACL-deficient UKA, {{is one of}} the main concerns that frighten surgeons. Fixed bearings are usually flatter, allowing a sliding motion of the femoral condyle. On the other hand, mobile bearings present a sliding motion on their inferior aspect over the tibial tray while a rolling motion of the femoral component is expected on the congruent superior surface. In laboratory evaluation, Blunn et al. [1] found a dramatically increased polyethylene wear with cyclic sliding compared with compression or rolling because of increased subsurface shear stresses, concluding that low-conformity components (i.e. fixed <b>bearings)</b> <b>inserted</b> with high ligamentous laxity are susceptible to antero-posterior sliding and hence high wear [1].|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Permanent {{dislocation}} of the patella (PDP) {{is a rare}} condition. In {{cases of}} PDP with tibiofemoral arthritis, total knee arthroplasty may be performed through a medial parapatellar approach with patellar realignment. In this article we present two cases of PDP with tibiofemoral osteoarthritis successfully treated via lateral approach TKA without any additional realignment procedure. We performed two total knee arthroplasties for PDP with lateral tibiofemoral arthritis through a lateral approach without any realignment procedure. Mobile <b>bearing</b> <b>inserts</b> were used to adjust rotational alignment. The patients showed improved functional outcomes (Japanese Orthopaedic Association Knee score and Oxford Knee Score), and improved range of motion.

By using these cloned cDNAs as hybridization probes, an RNA species was identified that had the properties expected of mRNA specific for P- 450 scc with respect to tissue specificity, corticotropin (ACTH) -mediated regulation of synthesis, {{and size of the}} protein product synthesized in vitro. In RNA samples obtained from bovine adrenal cortex, from bovine corpus luteum, and from cultured bovine adrenocortical cells, it was found that P- 450 scc is encoded by mRNA species approximately equal to 2000 bases long, a majority of which are polyadenylylated. P- 450 scc mRNA was not detected in RNA samples prepared from bovine heart, liver, and kidney. Treatment of cultured bovine adrenocortical cells with ACTH resulted in the appearance of elevated levels of P- 450 scc mRNA within 8 hr. Thus, ACTH promotes the enhancement of P- 450 scc gene transcription or acts to stabilize the transcripts. When pBSCC- 2 cDNA was used to probe high molecular weight bovine DNA following treatment with restriction endonucleases, a simple pattern of hybridization was observed indicating that P- 450 scc may be encoded by a single gene...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Patient {{specific}} instrumentation (PSI) {{has been}} proposed {{as a means of}} improving surgical accuracy and ease of implantation during technically challenging procedures such as unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). The purpose of this prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to compare the accuracy of implantation and functional outcome of mobile bearing medial UKA s implanted with and without PSI by experienced UKA surgeons. Methods Mobile-bearing medial UKA s implanted were implanted in 43 patients using either PSI guides or conventional instrumentation. Intra-operative measurements, meniscal bearing size implanted, and post-operative radiographic analyses were performed to assess component positioning. Functional outcome was determined using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS). Results PSI guides could not be used in 3 cases due to concerns regarding accuracy and registration onto native anatomy, particularly on the tibial side. In general, similar component alignment and positioning was achieved using the two systems (n. s. for coronal/sagittal alignment and tibial coverage). The PSI group had greater tibial slope (p= 0. 029). The control group had a higher number of optimum size meniscal <b>bearing</b> <b>inserted</b> (95 % versus 52 %; p= 0. 001). There were no differences in OKS improvements (n. s). Conclusions Component positioning for the two groups was similar for the femur but less accurate on the tibial side using PSI, often with some unnecessarily deep resections of the tibial plateau. Although PSI was comparable to conventional instrumentation based on OKS improvements at 12 -months, we continue to use conventional instrumentation for UKA at our institution until further improvements to the PSI guides can be demonstrated. </p...|$|R
40|$|Diamond {{smoothing}} tools {{have been}} proposed for use in conjunction with diamond cutting tools {{that are used in}} many finish-machining operations. Diamond machining (including finishing) is often used, for example, in fabrication of precise metal mirrors. A diamond smoothing tool according to the proposal would have a smooth spherical surface. For a given finish machining operation, the smoothing tool would be mounted next to the cutting tool. The smoothing tool would slide on the machined surface left behind by the cutting tool, plastically deforming the surface material and thereby reducing the roughness of the surface, closing microcracks and otherwise generally reducing or eliminating microscopic surface and subsurface defects, and increasing the microhardness of the surface layer. It has been estimated that if smoothing tools of this type were used in conjunction with cutting tools on sufficiently precise lathes, {{it would be possible to}} reduce the roughness of machined surfaces to as little as 3 nm. A tool according to the proposal would consist of a smoothing insert in a metal holder. The smoothing insert would be made from a diamond/metal functionally graded composite rod preform, which, in turn, would be made by sintering together a bulk single-crystal or polycrystalline diamond, a diamond powder, and a metallic alloy at high pressure. To form the spherical smoothing tip, the diamond end of the preform would be subjected to flat grinding, conical grinding, spherical grinding using diamond wheels, and finally spherical polishing and/or buffing using diamond powders. If the diamond were a single crystal, then it would be crystallographically oriented, relative to the machining motion, to minimize its wear and maximize its hardness. Spherically polished diamonds could also be useful for purposes other than smoothing in finish machining: They would likely also be suitable for use as heat-resistant, wear-resistant, unlubricated sliding-fit <b>bearing</b> <b>inserts...</b>|$|R
