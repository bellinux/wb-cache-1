40|$|SummarySynapse {{formation}} and elimination occur throughout life, but {{the magnitude of}} such changes at distinct developmental stages remains unclear. Using transgenic mice overexpressing yellow fluorescent protein and transcranial two-photon microscopy, we repeatedly imaged dendritic spines on the apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons. In young adolescent mice (1 -month-old), 13 %– 20 % of spines were eliminated and 5 %– 8 % formed over 2 weeks in <b>barrel,</b> <b>motor,</b> and frontal cortices, indicating a cortical-wide spine loss during this developmental period. As animals mature, {{there is also a}} substantial loss of dendritic filopodia involved in spinogenesis. In adult mice (4 – 6 months old), 3 %– 5 % of spines were eliminated and formed over 2 weeks in various cortical regions. Over 18 months, only 26 % of spines were eliminated and 19 % formed in adult barrel cortex. Thus, after a concurrent loss of spines and spine precursors in diverse regions of young adolescent cortex, spines become stable and a majority of them can last throughout life...|$|E

50|$|Around 1900, when broken watchsprings {{were more}} of a problem, some pocketwatches used a {{variation}} of the going <b>barrel</b> called the <b>motor</b> <b>barrel</b> or safety barrel. Mainsprings usually broke at their attachment to the arbor, where bending stresses are greatest. When the mainspring broke, the outer part recoiled and the momentum spun the barrel in the reverse direction. This applied great force to the delicate wheel train and escapement, often breaking pivots and jewels.|$|R
40|$|Chronic pain is a {{long-lasting}} debilitating {{condition that}} is particularly difficult to treat {{due to the lack}} of identified underlying mechanisms. Although several key contributing processes have been described at the level of the spinal cord, very few studies have investigated the supraspinal mechanisms underlying chronic pain. Using a combination of approaches (cortical intrinsic imaging, immunohistochemical and behavioural analysis), our study aimed to decipher the nature of functional and structural changes in a mouse model of orofacial neuropathic pain, focusing on cortical areas involved in various pain components. Our results show that chronic neuropathic orofacial pain is associated with decreased haemodynamic responsiveness to whisker stimulation in the barrel field cortex. This reduced functional activation is likely due to the increased basal neuronal activity (measured indirectly using cFos and phospho-ERK immunoreactivity) observed in several cortical areas, including the contralateral <b>barrel</b> field, <b>motor</b> and cingulate cortices. In the same animals, immunohistochemical analysis of markers for active pre- or postsynaptic elements (Piccolo and phospho-Cofilin, respectively) revealed an increased immunofluorescence in deep cortical layers of the contralateral <b>barrel</b> field, <b>motor</b> and cingulate cortices. These results suggest that long-lasting orofacial neuropathic pain is associated with exacerbated neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity at the cortical level...|$|R

Even a seeded quantum FEL for g-beams may become possible, with much higher brilliance and spectral flux. At the same time new exciting possibilities open up for focused g-beams. We describe a new experiment at the g-beam of the ILL reactor (Grenoble), where we observed {{for the first time that}} the index of refraction for g-beams is determined by virtual pair creation. Using a combination of refractive and reflective optics, efficient monochromators for g-beams are being developed. Thus we have to optimize the system of the g-beam facility, the g-beam optics and g-detectors. We can trade g-intensity for band width, going down to Delta E_g/E_g ~ 10 ^- 6 and address individual nuclear levels. 'Nuclear photonics' stresses the importance of nuclear applications. We can address with g-beams individual nuclear isotopes and not just elements like with X-ray beams. Compared to X rays, g-beams can penetrate much deeper into big samples like radioactive waste <b>barrels,</b> <b>motors</b> or batteries. We can perform tomography and microscopy studies by focusing down to micron resolution using Nucl. Reson. Fluorescence for detection with eV resolution and high spatial resolution. We discuss the dominating M 1 and E 1 excitations like scissors mode, two-phonon quadrupole octupole excitations, pygmy dipole excitations or giant dipole excitations under the new facet of applications.

40|$|SummaryWhile progenitor-restricted factors broadly specify area {{identities in}} {{developing}} neocortex, the downstream regulatory elements involved in acquisition of those identities in postmitotic neurons are largely unknown. Here, we identify Bhlhb 5, a transcription factor expressed in layers II–V, as a postmitotic regulator of area identity. Bhlhb 5 is initially {{expressed in a}} high caudomedial to low rostrolateral gradient that transforms into a sharp border between sensory and rostral motor cortices. Bhlhb 5 null mice exhibit aberrant expression of area-specific genes and structural organization in the somatosensory and caudal motor cortices. In somatosensory cortex, Bhlhb 5 null mice display postsynaptic disorganization of vibrissal <b>barrels.</b> In caudal <b>motor</b> cortex, Bhlhb 5 null mice exhibit anomalous differentiation of corticospinal motor neurons, accompanied by failure of corticospinal tract formation.

40|$|The {{bioavailability}} of orally administered drugs mainly {{depends on}} solubility and permeability. Since {{the advent of}} high throughput screening (HTS) in drug discovery process the resultant compounds are often high molecular weight and highly lipophilic, that show poor solubility. Scientists have tried to address solubility issues by various pharmaceutical interventions. Today amongst many methods available to improve solubility and dissolution rate, preparation of solid dispersions and solid solutions has gained enormous attention. ^ Hot-melt extrusion {{is one of the}} most widely applied processing technologies in the plastic, rubber and food industry. Today this technology has found its place in the array of pharmaceutical manufacturing operations. Melt extrusion processes are currently applied in the pharmaceutical field for the manufacture of a verity of dosage forms and formulations such as granules, pellets, tablets, implants, transdermal systems and ophthalmic inserts. In this study the melt extrusion process is evaluated to formulate solid dispersion and solid solution of poorly water soluble model drug. ^ The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the utility of hot-melt extrusion (HME) in improving the dissolution rate of a poorly water-soluble model drug (Indomethacin) using suitable hydrophilic polymers such as Eudragit EPO (EPO), Polyvinyl pyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer (PVP-VA), Polyvinylpyrrolidone K 30 (PVPK 30), Poloxamer 188 (P 188). The secondary objective is to characterize physical and viscoelastic properties of materials prior to the actual melt extrusion process to assess their suitability for HME process and to establish correlation between these assessments with HME process parameters. To achieve these objectives, the research plan is mainly divided in to three broad sections: (1) Physico-mechanical evaluation of drug and polymer binary mixtures prior to hot-melt extrusion (thermal analysis, viscoelastic evaluation and solubility parameters). (2) Evaluation of hot-melt extrusion process parameters (such as <b>barrel</b> temperatures, <b>motor</b> load, screw speed, feed rate, melt pressure etc.) for the various formulations. (3) The performance attributes of hot-melt extrudate such as solid state characterization (differential scanning calorimetry, powder x-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy), intrinsic dissolution rate studies and stability studies. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C (TNC) has {{been implicated in}} neural development and plasticity but many of its functions in vivo remain obscure. Here we addressed {{the question as to}} whether the constitutive absence of TNC in mice affects cortical physiology and structure. Defined major cell populations (neurons and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia) were quantified in the somatosensory and motor cortices of adult TNC deficient (TNC 2 / 2) and wild-type (TNC 1 / 1) mice by immunofluorescence labelling and stereology. In both areas studied we found abnormally high neuronal density, astrogliosis, low density of parvalbumin-positive interneurons and reduced ratios of oligodendrocytes to neurons and of inhibitory to excitatory neurons in the TNC deficient as opposed to the non-deficient animals. Analysis of Golgi-impregnated layer V pyramidal neurons in TNC 2 / 2 animals showed aberrant dendrite tortuosity and redistribution of stubby spines within first- to third-order dendritic arbors. Significantly enhanced responses upon whisker stimulation were recorded epicranially over the <b>barrel</b> and the <b>motor</b> cortices of TNC 2 / 2 as compared to TNC 1 / 1 animals, and this effect might be associated with the diminished inhibitory circuitry. These results indicate that TNC is essential for normal cortical development and function...|$|R
40|$|Regional {{differences}} in EEG slow wave activity (SWA) during sleep after sleep deprivation (SD) {{may be a}} consequence of differential metabolic activation of cortical areas. We investigated {{the relationship between the}} regional EEG dynamics and 2 -deoxyglucose (DG) uptake after SD in mice. Six hours' SD were combined with natural unilateral whisker stimulation in an enriched environment to selectively activate the <b>barrel</b> cortex and <b>motor</b> areas. As expected, an interhemispheric asymmetry of 2 -DG uptake was found in the barrel cortex immediately after SD. To test whether sleep contributes to recovery of the asymmetry, the stimulation was followed by either undisturbed sleep or by an additional SD. The asymmetry vanished after recovery sleep but also after the additional period of wakefulness without stimulation. In addition, relative 2 -DG uptake in the primary motor cortex and retrosplenial area was significantly higher immediately after the SD than after the additional sleep or wakefulness, whereas no other region differed between the groups. Whisker stimulation elicited a greater increase in EEG SWA during non rapid eye movement sleep in the stimulated hemisphere than in the control hemisphere; this increase lasted for 10 h. Within a hemisphere, the initial increase in SWA was higher in the frontal than in the parietal derivation. We conclude that the regional SWA differences during sleep are use-dependent and {{may be related to the}} regional pattern of metabolism during the previous waking episode. However, the regional metabolic recovery is not dependent on sleep, and is not directly reflected in changes in SWA during sleep...|$|R

Being an energy intensive production method, process energy efficiency {{is one of the}} major concerns and the selection of the most energy efficient processing conditions is a key to reducing operating costs. Usually, extruders consume energy through the drive <b>motor,</b> <b>barrel</b> heaters, cooling fans, cooling water pumps, gear pumps, etc. Typically the drive motor is the largest energy consuming device in an extruder while barrel/die heaters are responsible for the second largest energy demand. This study is focused on investigating the total energy demand of an extrusion plant under various processing conditions while identifying ways to optimise the energy efficiency. Initially, a review was carried out on the monitoring and modelling of the energy consumption in polymer extrusion. Also, the power factor, energy demand and losses of a typical extrusion plant were discussed in detail. The mass throughput, total energy consumption and power factor of an extruder were experimentally observed over different processing conditions and the total extruder energy demand was modelled empirically and also using a commercially available extrusion simulation software. The experimental results show that extruder energy demand is heavily coupled between the machine, material and process parameters. The total power predicted by the simulation software exhibits a lagging offset compared with the experimental measurements. Empirical models are in good agreement with the experimental measurements and hence these can be used in studying process energy behaviour in detail and to identify ways to optimise the process energy efficiency.

40|$|Rats {{can readily}} {{be trained to}} jump a gap of around 16 cm {{in the dark and}} a {{considerably}} larger gap in the light for a food reward. In the light, they use vision to estimate the distance to be jumped. In the dark, they use their vibrissae at the farthest distances. Bilateral whisker shaving or barrel field lesions reduce the gap crossed in the dark by about 2 cm. Information from the <b>barrel</b> fields reaches <b>motor</b> areas via cortico-cortical, basal ganglia, or cerebellar pathways. The cells of origin of the ponto-cerebellar pathway are segregated in layer Vb of the barrel field. Efferent axons of Vb cells occupy a central position within the basis pedunculi and terminate on cells in the pontine nuclei. Pontine cells, in turn, project to the cerebellar cortex as mossy fibers. We trained normal rats to cross a gap in the light and in a dark alley that was illuminated with an infra-red source. When the performance was stable, we made unilateral lesions in the central region of the basis pedunculi, which interrupted connections from the barrel field to the pons while leaving cortico-cortical and basal ganglia pathways intact. Whisking was not affected on either side by the lesion, and the rats with unilateral peduncle lesions crossed gaps of the same distance as they did pre-operatively. Shaving the whiskers {{on the side of the}} face that retains its input to the pontine nuclei reduced the maximal gap jumped in the dark by the same amount as bilateral whisker shaving. Performance in the light was not affected. Regrowth of the shaved whiskers was associated with the recovery of the maximum distance crossed in the dark. In control cases, shaving the whiskers on the other side of the face did not reduce the distance jumped in the dark or in the light. These results suggest that the cerebellum must receive whisker information from the barrel fields for whisker-guided jumps...|$|R
40|$|Rats {{are able}} to sample their {{surroundings}} for tactile discrimination purposes by performing series of whisker deflections. In this perceptual state, called active perception, the animal chooses how to best manipulate its mobile sensors (the whiskers) based on the incoming sensory information it receives via these sensors, so as to perform better at the task at hand. On {{the other end of}} the perceptual spectrum lies passive perception which can be described as a “wake-up” call to investigate the surroundings if a sensation was received which was not expected by the subject. During active perception each deflection leads to a mechanical stress at the base of the whisker. Additionally, the touch of any object which the whisker finds along its path also leads to whisker deflections and hence whisker vibrations. These combined vibrations are termed the vibrotactile signal. The nature of the vibrotactile signal is highly complex and it is still not known which of its physical parameters are used by the animal for discrimination. Moreover, it is not yet clear if the tactile system of the rat integrates over this signal to reduce its complexity or if the animals have access to instantaneous kinematic parameters such as minute details of the whisker trajectory. Some of the possible parameters which the animals could use for performing tactile discrimination include the temporal frequency of the signal (i. e. its spectral information), its intensity (i. e. the mean speed of the signal) or instantaneous kinematic features (such as details of the whisker trajectory). In this work I established a new psychophysical Go/No-Go paradigm for spatial frequency discrimination using actively whisking head fixed rats in a virtual environment where a natural stimulus is replaced by electrical microstimulation of the ascending sensory pathway. The major advantage of replacing natural stimuli such as textures with electrical stimulation is the greater level of stimulus control achieved from trial to trial. The initial goal of the project was to investigate the differences in neuronal activation in the <b>barrel</b> and <b>motor</b> cortex arising in active versus passive perception. For the purpose I wanted to train animals to discriminate sets of virtual grids with defined line spacing first in an active case- where the animal has to sweep its whisker in space and receive an electrical pulse in the primary somatosensory cortex each time a grid line is crossed, and then in a passive case- in which the same animal is retrained to keep its whiskers still and the stimulation patterns from the active case are replayed in the cortex. To my great surprise, even after extensive training none of the experimental animals was able to discriminate between a set of two virtual grids with significantly different spatial frequencies. Thus I was unable to proceed towards my initial goal and show that the motor program of the animal would be changed in order to optimize sensory percept in active versus passive case. Instead, I provided the animals with an additional cue, increasing the amplitude of the electrical stimulation on a No-Go trial as compared to a Go trial, which led to immediate discrimination for all tested animals. This finding speaks against pure frequency discrimination but rather indicates that rats are more able to use instantaneous events such as the electrical pulse amplitude cues. This new knowledge implied that the current working hypothesis that frequency is the most important parameter for rats during active or passive perception had to be revisited. I thus abandoned the pursuit to find the differences between active and passive perception, and concentrated on fleshing out if the instantaneous kinematic events as given by the electrical pulse amplitude were the actual parameter of a surface which the animals use for active discrimination. To thoroughly investigate this question, I varied several parameters of the virtual grids used in the active whisking task described here, including their spatial frequency, the electrical pulse amplitude and the position of the grid along the whisking cycle. I thus investigated an additional set of stimuli in which the electrical microstimulation amplitude in a Go trial was increased in even steps until it reached the value set for a No-Go stimulus. The stimuli providing an electrical pulse amplitude cue were easily discriminated by the animals whereas the stimuli differing only in spatial frequency were more challenging for the animals, leading to an increased amount of false responses. An experiment in which the virtual grids varied only in spatial frequency and starting position along the whisking cycle, thus blurring position information, proved the behaviorally most difficult one for the animals. The performance improved in a control experiment which kept the virtual grid arrangement same as in this experiment but provided the No-Go grids with electrical pulse amplitude cue. These results show that the rats were able to use the position information given by the virtual grids for discrimination. Altogether, one can conclude that the rats were not using the temporal frequency cues but used the electrical amplitude and grid position cue when available...|$|R
