5|$|Across Guam, damage totaled over $700million (2002USD, $ USD), {{placing it}} among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon injured 193people, as {{reported}} by the Guam Department of Health; most were lacerations and fractures caused <b>by</b> <b>flying</b> glass and other debris. There was one indirect death attributed to the storm, when a 71-year-old woman was cut <b>by</b> <b>flying</b> glass and subsequently suffered a fatal heart attack; medical help could not reach her due to the intensity of the storm. As six typhoons had passed directly over the island during the previous ten years, officials in Guam enacted strong building standards, keeping deaths and injuries to a minimum. The typhoon was considered by the public the worst typhoon to ever strike the island due to the large eye affecting most of the population.|$|E

5|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} changes due {{to change}} of altitude {{before or after}} diving can have a significant influence on decompression risk. Diving at high altitude requires special consideration in decompression planning. Such variations in ambient pressure caused <b>by</b> <b>flying</b> or surface travel involving changes in altitude will affect decompression and should be considered during dive planning and therefore may influence a planned dive profile.|$|E
