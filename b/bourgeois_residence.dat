50|$|Paul Huillard {{became a}} {{specialist}} in the faience of the Yonne department.In 1960 he published {{a book on the}} faience of Auxerre from 1725 to 1870.Huillard assembled a large collection of faience objects, and installed his collection in the house where Georges Moreau was born, a pleasant <b>bourgeois</b> <b>residence</b> from the 19th century typical of the local architecture.He died on 11 February 1966 in Paris at the age of 90.He bequeathed the house and faience collection to the town of Villiers-Saint-Benoît, where it is now the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire de Puisaye.|$|E
50|$|His most {{important}} work is Gustmeyer House opposite Christiansborg Palace on Ved Stranden. Completed in 1797 for the well-to-do merchant, F.L. Gustmeyer, {{it is one}} of Copenhagen's first <b>bourgeois</b> <b>residences</b> with free-standing columns. All Quist's surviving works are now listed buildings.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{buildings}} in the street date from the rebuilding of the city following the Copenhagen Fire of 1795 and are listed. No. 10 and 12 were built in 1796-1797 {{to the design of}} unknown architects. The Gustmeyer House at No. 14 was designed by Johan Martin Quist and completed in 1797. It is one of Copenhagen's first <b>bourgeois</b> <b>residences</b> with free-standing columns.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to see in Laurent's photographs that the murals were framed with borders painted in classicist design as were the doors, windows and the frieze above the door. The walls were papered as was the custom in <b>bourgeois</b> and aristocratic <b>residences,</b> possibly with wallpaper from the Royal Painted Paper Factory which was patronized by Fernando VII. The paper {{on the ground floor}} was decorated with motifs of fruit and leaves and the first floor was decorated with geometrical drawings organized in diagonal lines. The photographs also document the state of the drawings before they were moved, showing, for example, that {{a large part of the}} right-hand side of Witches’ Sabbath has not been conserved, although it was transferred to canvas by Martínez Cubells.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} a {{terminus}} but architecturally resembles the large main-line {{stations of the}} Nord company's network, with two corner pavilions. The semi-circular arched windows {{on the ground floor}} and mansard roofs with dormer windows lend it the appearance of a <b>bourgeois</b> <b>residence.</b> The clock identifies it as a station and echoes the seaside style that corresponds to the environment of Mers. Originally the walls of the building were not plastered but made up of bare brickwork, as in the majority of Le Tréport buildings. The station therefore represented the contrasting identities of the two towns which it served.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The article proposes the {{approach}} to the house that the Hungarian architect Ernö Goldfinger built for himselfin the Hampstead neighborhood, London in 1939. The complex and unique exercise, in which Goldfinger bases the greatest part of his principles, is visible in this House at Willow Road and particularly evident in its façade. The study of the human experience in the architectonic space, in relationship with the building's envelope, is fundamental for the architect. In this sense, its theoretical legacy is expressed in his writings for the Architectural Review magazine between 1941 and 1942 : "The Sensation of Space", "Urbanism and Spatial Order" and "Elements of Enclosed Space". The analysis of this enigmatic elevation brings up {{a number of questions}} that are, in themselves, a true manifest in favor of an architecture free of any stylistic affi liation. Here, Goldfinger questions his own reflections about the spatial order, composition, scale, character and construction. This way, the proposal for Willow Road cannot be explained in functional or mechanistic terms. It needs a phenomenological vision and a precise approach to start to unveil its keys. This home can be understood as a <b>bourgeois</b> <b>residence</b> but also stands out a Modern exercise. It offers the opportunity to unveil a very particular way-of-doing, in which some rootless architects, free of the ruling English traditionalism and any dogmatism, step off the predictable path in that moment. Instead, they contaminate the English Modern architecture and originate a scene of different influences difficult to recognize in any other location. The footprint of this revised modernity of unmistakable Modern spirit, fi ltered from a Classical attitude, influenced the following generation of English architects, exemplary in many of the works of Denys Lasdun. </p...|$|E
40|$|Often you {{are confronted}} with large and small monumental restoration, without realizing that, {{alongside}} the monuments, the minor building fabric enjoys a growing insecurity. In Europe, the traditional urban fabric, guarantees and substantiates {{the context of the}} major works through the restoration work carried out from the silent population. The decline in the population of the Italian Historical centres, generally large, however, creates new worries about the possibility, economic and social, to operate conservative spontaneous action, while the assumption of general public intervention and preservative constraint, represent a dystopia, rather than a reasonable aiming point. Through considerations of a historic building for <b>residences</b> <b>bourgeois</b> and popular, which included medieval warehouses, we will try, with technical considerations, drawings and graphics, to highlight the social significance of popular action in the restoration and its fragility against the constraint facing forms and uses. In particular the difficulties of organization of the condominium complex, the different owners of estates, the complexity of the urban system and the contrast between rigid positions of protection and the more possibilist conservative positions, with the dangers that even in these exist, can represent both a challenge and a hope in urban planning...|$|R
50|$|Coffee {{production}} and the resettlement of the Portuguese royal family in Brazil in 1808 again brought prosperity to the colony. By 1815, when Brazil became a kingdom, Rio de Janeiro was {{large enough to accommodate}} a foreign population. At about that time the city's original appearance was being transformed; from 1808 to 1818 some 600 houses and 100 country houses were built, and many older buildings were restored. Many streets were lighted and paved, more land was reclaimed, new roads were opened, and new public fountains were installed. Among new institutions established were the Royal Press, the Royal Library, the Theatre of Saint John, the Academy of Fine Arts, the Botanical Garden, and the Bank of Brazil. When King John VI returned to Portugal in 1821, Rio had almost 113,000 inhabitants and 13,500 buildings, and the town had extended both northward and southward. A year later Brazil was independent.Expansion of coffee plantations in the State of Rio de Janeiro gave a new impulse to the city's development. Nobles and <b>bourgeois</b> moved their <b>residences</b> north to the São Cristóvão district. Merchants and English bankers chose to live around the Outeiro da Glória and Praia do Flamengo areas in the south, or they established their residences in the nearby Botafogo and Laranjeiras districts. The French, on the other hand, lived in country houses scattered in the Tijuca area farther westward.|$|R
