25|$|Queen's Square {{shopping}} centre {{opened in the}} town centre in 1971, providing shoppers with a 60-unit indoor {{shopping centre}} and an 850-space multi-storey car park. It cost £3million to build. The smaller King's Square shopping centre also opened in the town in 1971. On 8 December 2011, 40 years after the opening of Queen's Square, Sandwell Council announced that Queen's Square would be refurbished {{at a cost of}} £5million. By this stage, the centre was falling into disrepair and a mere 33 of the 61 available units were occupied. Once again, West Bromwich had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>hard</b> by another recession, with high unemployment throughout the town, as well as a high vacancy rate for commercial and industrial units.|$|E

25|$|Italy has <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>hard</b> by the Financial {{crisis of}} 2007–08, that {{exacerbated}} the country's structural problems. Effectively, after a strong GDP growth of 5–6% per {{year from the}} 1950s to the early 1970s, and a progressive slowdown in the 1980-90s, the country virtually stagnated in the 2000s. The political efforts to revive growth with massive government spending eventually produced a severe rise in public debt, that stood at over 135% of GDP in 2014, ranking second in the EU only after the Greek one (at 174%). For all that, the largest chunk of Italian public debt is owned by national subjects, a major difference between Italy and Greece, {{and the level of}} household debt is much lower than the OECD average.|$|E
25|$|In April/May 2005, Piskun {{released}} {{more details}} of the ongoing investigation. He told the press that after Gongadze was murdered, a second group disinterred him and re-buried him where he was eventually found, in the constituency of Socialist Party leader Oleksandr Moroz. According to Piskun, {{the aim was to}} undermine the government (led by Viktor Yushchenko when he was still Prime Minister). The second group was part of or allied with the United Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (SDPUo), a pro-oligarch grouping which had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>hard</b> by Yushchenko's crackdown on corruption and therefore wanted to see his government toppled. According to the journal Ukrayina moloda (14 April 2005), the SDPUo moved Gongadze in order to discredit President Leonid Kuchma and force early elections, which could have led to party leader Medvedchuk succeeding Kuchma.|$|E
25|$|Quảng Trị City {{was clear}} of Communist troops by midday on 1 February, and ARVN units with U.S. air support had cleared Tri Buu Village of PAVN troops. The {{remnants}} of the 812th, having <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>hard</b> by ARVN defenders and American air power and ground troops {{on the outskirts of}} the city, particularly artillery and helicopters, broke up into small groups, sometimes mingling with crowds of fleeing refugees, and began to exfiltrate the area, trying to avoid further contact with Allied forces. They were pursued by the American forces in a circular formation forced contact with the fleeing Communists over the next ten days. Heavy fighting continued with large well-armed Communist forces south of Quảng Trị City, and there were lighter contacts in other areas. This pursuit continued throughout the first ten days of February.|$|E

500|$|Fitzsimmons {{dominated}} Sharkey {{throughout the}} fight, {{and in the}} eighth round, he hit Sharkey with his famed [...] "solar plexus punch", an uppercut under the heart that could render a man temporarily helpless. Fitzsimmons' next punch apparently caught Sharkey below the belt and Sharkey dropped, clutched his groin, and rolled on the canvas, screaming foul. Wyatt stopped the bout, ruling that Fitzsimmons had hit Sharkey below the belt, but virtually no one witnessed the punch. Earp awarded the fight to Sharkey, whom attendants carried out as [...] "limp as a rag". The 15,000 fans in attendance greeted his decision with loud boos and catcalls. It was widely believed that no foul had occurred and Earp had bet on Sharkey. While several doctors verified afterward that Sharkey had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>hard</b> below the belt, the public had bet heavily on Fitzsimmons and they were livid at the outcome.|$|E
500|$|Ruth was {{the first}} {{baseball}} star {{to be the subject}} of overwhelming public adulation. Baseball had been known for star players such as Ty Cobb and [...] "Shoeless Joe" [...] Jackson, but both men had uneasy relations with fans. In Cobb's case, the incidents were sometimes marked by violence. Ruth's biographers agreed that he benefited from the timing of his ascension to [...] "Home Run King". The country had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>hard</b> by both the war and the 1918 flu pandemic and longed for something to help put these traumas behind it. Ruth also resonated in a country which felt, {{in the aftermath of the}} war, that it took second place to no one. Montville argued that Ruth was a larger-than-life figure who was capable of unprecedented athletic feats in the nation's largest city. The Babe became an icon of the significant social changes that marked the early 1920s. In his history of the Yankees, Glenn Stout noted [...] that [...] "Ruth was New York incarnate—uncouth and raw, flamboyant and flashy, oversized, out of scale, and absolutely unstoppable".|$|E

2500|$|The MCC {{returned}} to Sydney for their last state match and the Fifth and final Test. 34,198 fans came {{to watch the}} game over four days and despite frequent rain the match was fought to a finish and they were far from disappointed. The New South Wales captain Keith Miller won the toss and the Sheffield Shield champions elected to bat, but collapsed spectacularly to 3/3 as Alec Bedser (5/57) {{returned to}} form, removing both openers for ducks and having Richie Benaud caught by Johnny Wardle for one. Tom Graveney at slip caught the 18-year-old Bobby Simpson off Frank Tyson for 6 and Keith Miller off Peter Loader for 11 and New South Wales were 25/6. The 20 old Peter Philpott (46) and 21-year-old [...] "Sam" [...] Booth (74 not out) rescued the innings with a stand of 83, but Bedser returned to dismiss Philpot and Alan Davidson, Graveney's third catch. Johnny Wardle had wicket-keeper Ossie Lambert caught by Colin Cowdrey and Vic Wilson (2/1) came in {{at the end and}} took two wickets for one run off nine balls, Graveney taking his fourth catch to end the inninngs on 172 when John Treanor went for a duck. Keith Miller bowled Wilson for a duck and Pat Crawford got Peter May for 3 and the MCC ended the day on 4/2. They did not immediately improve their situation in the morning as Alan Davidson (4/25) dismissed nightwatchman Peter Loader for a duck after he had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>hard</b> on the thigh by Miller, Reg Simpson for 6 and Colin Cowdrey for 12, and the MCC were 35/5. Tom Graveney (35) and Len Hutton (48) rescued the innings with a stand of 59, Hutton ironically batting at number 7 to give himself a rest, Godfrey Evans made a perky 40, Johnny Wardle slashed his way to 19, but Tyson was run out by Ronald Briggs for 3 and the innings closed on 172, the scores even. Briggs was bowled by Tyson for a duck (and a pair), but Test hopefuls Jim Burke (98) and Bobby Simpson (62) saw out the day and added 159 for the second wicket, the injured Loader unable to bowl. When it rained the umpires refused to stop play and Hutton led his men off, leaving Simpson waiting at the crease on 98. When play resumed the angry Simpson was fooled by a Johnny Wardle left-arm reverse-googly and stumped. Graveney took his fifth catch off Wardle (5/118) to dispose of Burke and Davidson was caught by Cowdrey for a duck to leave New South Wales 196/4. Richie Benaud (59) and Miller (71) added 64, smashing [...] "Farmer Jim" [...] Wilson for 42 runs off 4 eight ball overs before Benaud was stumped off Wardle. Bedser (2/87) dismissed both Miller and Booth and Miller declared half an hour from stumps on 314/8. The MCC needed 315 to win in just over a day, but Hutton tried to have another [...] "rest" [...] by batting at number 5 and Simpson (24) and Graveney (28) opened the innings. They were 26/0 {{at the end of the}} day, but both fell to Benaud (2/62). Wilson was bowled by Davidson (2/43) for 4 and the tourists were in trouble at 68/3. Peter May (42), Len Hutton (59), Crowdrey (33) and Evans (39) kept the runs coming even though wickets fell at regular intervals. At 250/6 needed only 65 more runs, but leg-spinner John Treanor (3/39) cleaned up the tail as they slumped from 261/7 to 269 all out and New South Wales won a thrilling 45 run victory, the only defeat the tourists suffered except for the First Test. It was a stunning vindication of Keith Miller's inspirational captaincy, but it was too late for the Ashes and he never became the captain of Australia.|$|E

He had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>hard,</b> but he was coming through without broken bones, which was more than Simon Dolliver and many another could say. And not one of his business friends had been ruined. He had compelled them to stay in line to save himself, and they had been saved as well.|$|E
