50|$|The BPDG {{has reached}} a {{consensus}} {{on the use of}} a technical broadcast flag standard for digital <b>broadcast</b> <b>copy</b> protection. The broadcast flag is an electronic marker embedded in over-the-air digital broadcast signals that would block or limit the ability of consumer electronics devices to make copies of the programs. The broadcast flag would also prevent the redistribution of such programs over the Internet. Despite reaching a consensus on this standard, the BPDG did not reach any agreement concerning how to implement the use of the flag or enforce it.|$|E

40|$|The text is {{designed}} for self-study of the grammar and pronunciation of standard oral North American English. It {{is not intended to}} replace learners ' dialects but to provide alternative ways of speaking for appropriate situations. The book is divided into two main sections. The first outlines pronunciation differences between Standard English (SE) and other common dialects. This section is subdivided into chapters on consonant clusters, consonant sounds, vowel sounds, and common word pronunciation differences. The second section elaborates on grammatical differences. Each of these sections includes pronunciation drills, practice sentences, and a final exam. Appended materials consist of the answers to drills, samples of <b>broadcast</b> <b>copy</b> (news, sports, weather, commercial, and public service announcements) for practice, and notes and sources.

40|$|Based on {{extending}} the sequential execution model of Prolog to include parallel execution, {{we present a}} method for OR-parallel execution of Prolog on a multiprocessor system. The method reduces the overhead incurred by parallel processing. It allows many processing elements (PEs) to process simultaneously a common branch of a search tree, and each of these PEs creates its local environment and selects a subtree for processing without communication. The run-time overhead is small: simple and efficient operations for selecting the proper subtree. Communication is necessary only when some PEs have exhausted their search spaces and there are others still searching for solutions. The method is able to utilize most of the technology devised for sequential implementation of Prolog. It is optimized for an architecture which supports <b>broadcast</b> <b>copying.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a survey of}} architectures, techniques, and algorithms for multicasting data in communication switching networks. We start with a broadcast architecture using a separate copy network and a routing network. A few versions of this idea using Delta and Benes networks exist. Another multicast architecture is a recycling network where internal nodes act as relay points, accept packets from the switching fabric, and recycle {{them back into the}} fabric after relabeling the packets. Next, we give an overview of a system that uses the Boolean splitting multicast algorithm. In this system a nonblocking self-routing <b>broadcast</b> Banyan <b>copy</b> network has been proposed. The network consists of several components including a running adder network to generate running sums of copy numbers specified in the headers of input packets. We then describe a multicasting technique presented for a different class of switching networks called deflection-routing networks. Finally, the idea of extending a nonblocking network to a three-dimensional structure consisting of multiple parallel planes is also presented. At the end of this article, we compare the efficiencies of the presented multicast architectures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Digital image {{watermarking}} {{techniques are}} developed wide {{in recent years}} to keep up the broadcasting media and content authentication, <b>broadcast</b> observation, <b>copy</b> management, and lots of alternative applications. Therefore, several studies have used digital image watermarking to unravel this downside. This paper highlights digital image watermarking. It starts with a basic representation of digital image watermarking; it discusses the most needs and applications. Moreover, it reviews a number of the techniques and algorithmic rule utilized in image watermarking. Watermarking strength is one amongst the most important characteristics that influence the performance and applications of digital image watermarking. For rights safety, the watermarking strength should be increased while not considerably degrading the visual quality of the host image. The embedding method may be done by modifying the pixels of all the three channels in a very content-based manner. A comparison may be created between the planned embedding technique and alternative embedding strategies in terms of Peak Signal to Noise magnitude relation (PSNR). A second comparison may be created for the planned embedding technique supported completely different transforms (i. e. DCT and DWT) in terms of PSNR. The Normalized Correlation (NC) price between the initial watermark and also the extracted watermark when applying completely different attacks should be calculated to check the strength of the planned technique...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} usefulness of existing "conventional" collaboration-transparency systems, which permit the shared use of legacy, single-user applications. I find that conventional collaboration-transparency systems do not use network resources efficiently, and they impose an inflexible, tightly coupled style of collaboration {{because they do not}} adequately support important groupware principles: concurrent work, relaxed WYSIWIS, group awareness, and inherently collaborative tasks. This dissertation proposes and explores solutions to those deficiencies. The primary goal of this work is to maintain the benefits of collaboration transparency while relieving some of its disadvantages. To that end, I present an alternate implementation approach that provides many features previously seen only in applications specifically designed to support cooperative work, called collaboration-aware applications. The new approach uses a replicated architecture, in which a copy of the application resides on each user's machine, and the users' input events are <b>broadcast</b> to each <b>copy.</b> I discuss solutions to certain key problems in replicated architectures, such as maintaining consistency, unanticipated sharing, supporting late-joiners, and replicating system resources (e. g., files, sockets, and random number generators). To enhance the collaborative usability of a legacy application, the new approach transparently replaces selected single-user interface objects with multi-user versions at runtime. There are four requirements of an application platform needed to implement this approach: process migration, run-time object replacement, dynamic binding, and the ability to intercept and introduce low-level user input events. As an instance of this approach, I describe its incorpor [...] ...|$|R
