40|$|The {{effect of}} boron (B) {{nutrition}} on some wood properties of Pinus radiata D. Don was assessed on 8 -year-old trees from a <b>boron</b> <b>fertiliser</b> study at Ashley Forest. Wood samples were taken at breast height (1. 4 m). There {{were significant differences}} between samples from control trees and those treated with <b>boron</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> with regard to lumen diameter and cell wall thickness. However, differences in tracheid length were only marginal. Cell wall thickness in the samples from boron-treated trees was greater by 35 % in earlywood and 25 % in latewood. Cell lumen diameter was greater by 29 % in earlywood and 46 % in latewood. From these results {{it was evident that}} application of <b>boron</b> <b>fertiliser</b> produced an increase in both tracheid cross-sectional area and wall thickness. Furthermore, during microtomy the sections from the control samples tended to check radially, indicating possible differences between control and boron-treated trees in the microstructure and composition of wood cell walls. The staining of control sections with toluidine blue and phloroglucinol was consistently less intense than in the sections from boron-treated trees, and the differences in the staining intensity observed were pronounced enough to suggest that boron may {{have an effect on the}} lignification of wood cell walls...|$|E
40|$|Heavy {{broadcast}} {{applications of}} superphosphate (112 kg P/ha at planting and 75 kg P/ha at age 7) improved {{growth rates of}} Pinus radiata D. Don during the 11 -year study period by {{two or three times}} over the untreated plots. However, even these rates were unable to maintain phosphorus concentrations at non-limiting levels {{for more than a few}} years after application. <b>Boron</b> <b>fertiliser</b> prevented dieback, although there was no response in tree volume. Individual-tree doses of nitrogen fertiliser (17 g/tree) applied along with phosphorus and boron in the first two growing seasons, resulted by age 5 years in a 0. 6 -m height growth increase over plots treated with phosphorus and boron alone. However, a volume response was not detectable at age 7. Application of 150 kg N/ha with phosphorus and boron after thinning at age 7 years led to a 12 % volume response over the phosphorus plus boron treatment by age 11 years. However, this response was only short-lived. There was no response to nitrogen in the absence of phosphorus and boron. Associated with the response to phosphorus were increases in branch size. Ripping to 0. 75 m improved growth rates but discing had no effect. The response in volume to ripping was 13 and 27 m 3 /ha at ages 7 and 11 years, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} extra-root {{nutrition}} on sugar beet {{growth and development}} during vegetation period was examined in field trials. Simultaneously, yield and technological quality of tubers were evaluated. Sugar beet leaf area was increasing until August when it reached 715 grams per plant. Conclusively highest weight gains were noticed between 28 th July and 12 th August. By {{the end of the}} harvest, the weight of leaves was decreased to 550 grams per plant as the result of older leaves necrosis. The final leaf weight was in individual variants in range of 373 to 778 grams per plant. The highest weight was found in variant with magnesium application of Magnitra L fertilizer. High dynamics of root growth was recorded from 1 st July to 12 th August and from 8 th September to harvest. The highest final tuber weight (1, 274 to 1, 601 grams) was observed after Carbonbor K, Carbonbor and Bortrac fertilizer application, i. e. boron application varieties. The highest yield was reached after sodium nitrate application, while the lowest was in control group. Treated groups got in average better outcomes than control group. Alpha amino nitrogen content was low, the lowest values were in average determined after higher <b>boron</b> content <b>fertiliser</b> application. Soluble ash content was in range of 0. 33 to 0. 42 %. The lowest one was in control group and the groups with <b>boron</b> application <b>fertiliser.</b> MB factor value was positive in all groups and the highest quality sugar beet was harvested in the groups with higher boron application. After yield results evaluation, two relationships were determined; a very strong relationship (with r = 0, 834 **) between MB factor and water-soluble ash values and a negative relationship (with r = - 0, 613 **) between digestion and MB factor...|$|R
40|$|Needle loss {{in black}} spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B. P. S.) {{plantations}} growing on very well-drained acid podsols was pursued as a nutrient problem. Sampling {{during the period}} of bud burst and shoot extension, followed by foliar nutrient analysis, highlighted boron deficiency as a possible cause. Black spruce rapidly took up <b>fertiliser</b> <b>boron.</b> A speculative explanation for 1 -year-old foliage mortality in the spring following drought in the previous summer involved the role of boron in regulating carbohydrate metabolism and winter dormancy...|$|R
