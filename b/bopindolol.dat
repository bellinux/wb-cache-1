50|$|<b>Bopindolol</b> (INN) is a beta blocker. It is an ester {{which acts}} as a prodrug for its active {{metabolite}} 4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-2-methylindole.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>bopindolol</b> monotherapy on {{blood pressure and}} plasma lipid fractions was investigated in 24 hypertensive patients. <b>Bopindolol</b> lowered blood pressure and heart rate significantly. When compared with placebo no changes {{were found in the}} plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. Plasma triglycerides were significantly increased after 4 and 8 weeks but not after 12 weeks of <b>bopindolol.</b> It is concluded that <b>bopindolol</b> is an effective and well tolerated beta-adrenoceptor blocker in hypertensive patients. The fact that it does not lower HDL cholesterol could be a potential advantage...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>bopindolol,</b> a new beta-adrenoceptor blocker, on the {{exercise}} tolerance of 12 in-patients, mean age 57 (5 years), with stable angina pectoris and documented {{coronary artery disease}} were evaluated. All patients received on 4 different days a single oral dose of <b>bopindolol</b> 0. 5 mg, <b>bopindolol</b> 1. 0 mg, <b>bopindolol</b> 2. 0 mg and placebo according to a double-blind latin square design. Treadmill symptoms-limited exercise tests were performed using a Bruce protocol, 3, 12 and 24 h after dosing. Bipindolol improved (P less than 0. 05) exercise tolerance in comparison with placebo (by a maximum of 33 %, 52 % and 26 % after the 2. 0 mg dose) with no adverse effect on ischaemia. The primary action of <b>bopindolol</b> appeared to be to reduce myocardial oxygen consumption (mainly by its negative chronotropic effect) for up to the 24 th hour after oral administration. Eight (66 %) patients were angina free at the 3 rd, 12 th and 24 th h exercise test. The effects of <b>bopindolol</b> were not dose-related. A short period of inactivity due to hospitalization may have influenced the exercise performance and led us to underestimate {{the presence of a}} dose-response. The results of this report suggest that <b>bopindolol</b> has a long lasting effect in the treatment of patients with chronic stable angina pectoris...|$|E
40|$|Oral {{administration}} of single doses of <b>bopindolol</b> (1 - 4 mg) caused significant {{reductions in the}} rises of systolic blood pressure and heart rate produced by exercise; only {{the reduction in the}} rise of heart rate was significantly dose-related. Resting heart rate was reduced by <b>bopindolol.</b> There were small effects on resting blood pressure. <b>Bopindolol</b> caused a significant attenuation of the rise in plasma renin activity produced by passive head-up tilting to 75 - 85 degrees. <b>Bopindolol</b> produced a dose-related attenuation of the increase in pulse rate evoked by passive tilting. All effects 1 - 4 were maintained for at least 24 h. There was no measurable effect on plasma potassium concentration, peak flow rate or forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a single oral dose of 4 -mg <b>bopindolol</b> were studied in eight {{patients}} in a single-blind placebo-controlled study. Continuous electrocardiogram recordings made over 72 hours after drug administration showed that <b>bopindolol</b> {{had no effect on}} minimal heart rate, but reduced maximal heart rate significantly (P < 0. 005) for at least 48 hours after treatment. During exercise to 60 watts, <b>bopindolol</b> significantly reduced exercise-induced tachycardia for up to at least 72 hours posttreatment (P < 0. 05). At this mild level of exercise in patients with stable angina pectoris no statistically significant effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure was demonstrated. We conclude that <b>bopindolol</b> is a long-acting beta-receptor antagonist with moderate intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. SCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bopindolol</b> is {{a potent}} and {{specific}} beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonist activity. In animal experiments it blocks both beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptors and possesses a long duration of action. In the present study in healthy volunteers <b>bopindolol</b> was about ten times more potent than pindolol in reducing isoprenaline-induced and exercise-induced tachycardia. In experiments on exercise-induced tachycardia an oral dose of 2 mg produced a near maximum reduction of exercise heart rate, occurring within 2 to 3 h of administration. With higher doses (up to 12 mg) the maximum effect was reached earlier (between 1 and 2 h). The long duration of action of <b>bopindolol</b> observed in animal studies was confirmed in man. Twenty-four hours after 4 and 10 mg <b>bopindolol</b> more than 2 / 3 of the maximum effect was still present. After 48 h 38 % of the maximum effect of 4 mg and 50 % of that of 12 mg remained. Even at 72 and 96 h exercise-induced tachycardia was still significantly lowered after both doses of the drug. When <b>bopindolol</b> was administered once daily for 5 days {{there was a slight}} increase in the maximum reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia during treatment with 1 mg/day but not with 4 mg/day, which produced a near maximum effect...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported that a}} potent new beta-blocker, tertatolol, when given at therapeutic doses to healthy volunteers, rapidly {{reduced the number of}} human mononuclear leukocyte beta-receptors. In the present study, the mechanism of receptor regulation by beta-antagonists incubated with target cells in vitro was investigated. Two different cell types (human mononuclear leukocytes and S 49 murine lymphoma cells) were used, and beta-adrenergic receptors were measured using either the hydrophilic ligand 3 H-CGP 12177 (specific for surface receptors) or lipophilic 125 I-pindolol (which measures total receptors). In a comparison between beta-blockers, tertatolol and <b>bopindolol,</b> but not propranolol and pindolol, were found to rapidly (1 hour at 37 degrees C) reduce the number of beta-adrenergic receptors. This was paralleled by a reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. The reduction in receptors was the same whether surface or total receptors were measured; thus, it was not due to receptor sequestration. This effect was not caused by partial agonist activity (<b>bopindolol</b> is a weak partial agonist); in parallel experiments, tertatolol and <b>bopindolol,</b> but not pindolol (potent partial agonist) and isoproterenol (full agonist), reduced beta-adrenergic receptors. Finally, this effect was not due to irreversible binding: the receptor reduction induced by the irreversible blocker bromo-acetyl-alprenolol-methane (BAAM) was stable for several hours, while the effect of tertatolol and <b>bopindolol</b> was slowly reversed over the same time course. We suggest that tertatolol and <b>bopindolol</b> have two effects on beta-adrenergic receptors: they bind competitively, and then they modify the receptors so that they are no longer available for binding by ligands or catecholamines...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, <b>bopindolol,</b> {{have been}} studied in 18 hypertensive patients {{with varying degrees of}} renal impairment following single and multiple oral dosing. <b>Bopindolol,</b> which undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, was found to accumulate in patients with chronic renal failure but the disposition in patients on regular haemodialysis did not differ significantly from patients with normal renal function. The mechanism underlying these changes in pharmacokinetics is not clear but suggests the presence of metabolic inhibitors in uraemic plasma which are removed by regular haemodialysis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bopindolol,</b> an esterified beta-adrenoceptor {{blocking}} drug, {{was administered}} to nine healthy male volunteers in oral (1 mg and 4 mg) and intravenous (1 mg) doses. Plasma concentrations determined using a radio-receptor assay (RRA) and high pressure liquid chromatography (h. p. l. c.) yielded almost identical results, indicating that hydrolysed <b>bopindolol,</b> the major metabolite, {{is responsible for the}} pharmacological activity of the drug. After intravenous administration the half-life for the formation of the hydrolysis product was about 0. 3 h. The elimination of hydrolysed <b>bopindolol</b> from the plasma, determined with a one-compartment model occurred with a half-life of about 4 h. There were indications for a longer beta phase of elimination with a half-life of about 8 h, which, owing to the relative insensitivity of the method for concentrations present after more than 24 h, could not be determined exactly. The absolute bioavailability of the active compound is about 70 %. Cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade was determined as the reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia. With oral doses the maximum effect was reached after 3 h (- 29 beats min- 1 after 1 mg, - 40 beats min- 1 after 4 mg). After intravenous administration most of the effect was present after 0. 5 h but the maximum effect (- 33 beats min- 1) was only reached at 3 h. <b>Bopindolol</b> possesses a long duration of action: after 48 h 33 % of the maximum effect of the oral dose of 4 mg was still present.

40|$|Urinary albumin {{excretion}} is {{a marker}} of renal damage in diabetic or hypertensive patients and a reduction of albuminuria during beta-blockade has been demonstrated in several studies. In the present {{study the effects of}} beta-blockade with drugs known for differences in their impact on renal function (propranolol, atenolol, <b>bopindolol)</b> on albumin excretion in normotensive and normoalbuminuric subjects were investigated. No effect of beta-blockade on albumin excretion was found, despite decreased plasma renin activity, blood pressure and heart rate. It was concluded that studies in healthy controls are not useful to predict the outcome of treatment in microalbuminuric patients. Cross-over studies using different beta-blockers have yet to be done in micro- or macroalbuminuric patients to evaluate the potential for benefit...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} different combination therapies in hypertensive patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) on a monotherapy with a calcium antagonist: 1, 647 hypertensive patients were enrolled to receive placebo for 4 weeks followed by isradipine (ISR) 2. 5 mg twice daily (b. i. d.) for 4 weeks. Nonresponders [diastolic BP (DBP) > 90 mm Hg] {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either the beta-blocker <b>bopindolol</b> 0. 5 or 1 mg/day, the diuretic metolazone 1. 25 or 2. 5 mg/day, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril 10 or 20 mg/day, ISR 5 mg b. i. d., or placebo. One hundred seventy-five receiving placebo dropped out; 93 % (n = 1, 376) of the 1, 472 patients finished 4 -week monotherapy with ISR. Sixty percent (n = 826) reached target BP, and 40 % (n = 550) remained uncontrolled and were randomized. Regardless of dosage, all drugs led to a comparable reduction in BP except for the lower dosage of <b>bopindolol</b> and ISR 5 mg b. i. d., which were less effective in lowering systolic BP (SBP). The BP decrease achieved by combination therapy ranged from 10 to 15 mm Hg SBP and from 7 to 11 mm Hg DBP but remained unchanged with placebo. Side effects were minor, and only 2. 4 % of patients discontinued therapy because of side effects. The side-effect score for edema was lower with ISR plus diuretics than with other combinations, whereas the ACE inhibitor was associated with a higher score for cough. Monotherapy with a calcium antagonist normalizes BP in about two-thirds of patients when used in general practice. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|PhDThe {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with developing optimization methods for chiral and achiral resolution and quantitation of some chiral beta blocker compounds namely tertatolol, <b>bopindolol,</b> and some fixed drug combinations (amlodipine, atorvastatin, rosiglotazone and glimepiride) using capillary electrophoresis technique. The principles of the proposed procedures {{as well as the}} experimental parameters were studied, discussed, explained and the data obtained were statistically analyzed. The developed methods were applied for determination of these drugs in human plasma and in pharmaceutical products. In addition we applied different computerized methods as molecular modeling, multiple-objective optimization strategy and experimental design to conform, explain the experimental results and shortening the time of experiments. The thesis is divided into six main parts. Part I This part presents general introduction about capillary electrophoresis technique and its advantages in different modes of separation, efficiency, speed of resolution, minimal consumption of sample and repeated injections of a small volume. It includes an overview on principle of this technique involves electroosmotic mobility, electrophoretic mobility and migrations. Moreover, it involves an overview on the enantioseparations with different chiral selectors with emphasis on mechanisms for the enantioresolution with cyclodextrin. Part II This part presents general information about the studied pharmaceutical compounds of various classes including antihypertensive drugs (tertatolol, <b>bopindolol</b> and amlodipine), antidiabetic drugs (rosiglotazone and glimepiride) anticholesterol drugs (atorvastatin). It includes overview on chemical formula, pharmacological actions, clinical uses and its significance. Part III In this part, a sensitive and selective capillary electrophoresis method for separation and determination of tertatolol enantiomers in human plasma and pharmaceutical formulations has been developed. Enantiomeric resolution was achieved by using 5 % highly sulphated gama cyclodextran, (HS--CD) in 25 mM triethylammonium phosphate (pH 2. 5) with UV detection set at 200 nm. A 22 cm effective length uncoated fused-silica capillary at a constant voltage 7 kV was used at 20 ˚C. Moreover, molecular dynamic docking simulations for four tertatolol-HS [...] CD complexes on the level of molecular mechanics and calculations of interaction energies were performed. Part IV In this part, a stereoselective capillary electrophoresis method for analysis of <b>bopindolol</b> enantiomers in human plasma and dosage forms has been developed. Enantiomeric resolution was achieved with 10 mM carboxy methyl β-cyclodextrin (CM-β-CD) in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2. 5) with UV detection set at 210 nm. A 50 cm uncoated fused silica capillary at constant voltage 20 kV was used at 20 ˚C. The method was linear in the range of 125 - 5000 ng/ ml (r = 0. 999) for each enantiomer with detection limit 50 ng/ml. The computational calculations for the inclusion complexes of the S-(-) and R-(+) -bopindolol-CM [...] CD were studied. The method was superior to all the previously reported chiral methods for determination of <b>bopindolol</b> in terms of its simplicity and sensitivity. Part V In this part, a simple, accurate, precise, and sensitive capillary electrophoresis technique coupled to a diode array detector (DAD) has been developed for the separation and simultaneous determination of amlodipine (AM) and atorvastatin (AT) from their combination formulations. The proposed method utilized fused silica capillary (50 cm x 75 mm ID) and background electrolyte (BGE) composed of phosphate buffer (25 mM, pH 6. 5) -methanol, (80 : 20, v/v). The separation was achieved at 15 KV applied voltage and 25 0 C. The two drugs were subjected to thermal, photolytic, hydrolytic, and oxidative stress conditions and the stressed samples were analyzed by the proposed method. The method has shown adequate separation for AM and AT from their main degradation products (UK- 55 - 410) & (PD 0162910 - 00), respectively, which demonstrated the specificity of the assay. The method was linear over the range of 1 – 50 mg/ml (r = 0. 9998) for both drugs. Intra- and inter-day RSD (n = 6) was ≤ 2. 2 %. Degradation products produced as a result of stress studies did not interfere with the detection of AM and AT and the assay can thus be considered stability indicating. Part VI In this part, capillary electrophoresis method for the simultaneous determination of rosiglitazone (RSG) and glimepiride (GLIM) in human plasma and pharmaceutical formulations has been developed and optimized by utilizing multiple response simultaneous optimization using the derringer`s desirability function. The separation was carried out by using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) with an uncoated silica capillary column and detected at 214 nm. The optimum assay conditions were: 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7 and voltage = 15. 4 kV at 34, 57 ˚C. The method showed good agreement between the experimental data and predictive value throughout the studied parameter space. The described method was linear over the range of 0. 05 - 16 μg/ ml (r = 0. 9993) for RSG and 0. 20 - 16 μg/ ml (0. 9998) for GLIM. Intra- and inter-day RSD (n = 6) was ≤ 2. 5 %. In all parts, the results obtained were statistically analyzed. The thesis includes a list of 283 original references, 25 tables, 44 figures and ends with a summary in Arabic...|$|E

After literature sources’ analyzing {{it was found that}} physical and physicochemical constants are basically used for β-blockers pharmacopoeial analysis; both physicochemical values and chemical reactions are used in forensic analysis, resulting in the article. It was founded that titration methods, mostly acid-base titration method, are used for β-blockers assay in the analysis of substances. For β-blockers detection in biological fluids and dosage forms, active pharmaceutical ingredients and metabolites mixture separation one should prefer physicochemical methods, such as gas chromatography and liquid chromatography, absorption UV-Visible spectroscopy, fluorometry, etc. Conclusion.

The CL signal is enhanced by hexametaphosphate. This CL reaction was used for devising automated sequential injection analysis (SIA) assay of I in pharmaceutical preparations. The PC-controlled SIA setup consisted of a Cavro XL 3000 2. 5 - ml syringe pump, Vici-Valco 10 -port selection valve and Spectra-Physics FS 970 flow- through fluorescence detector equipped with a lab-made CL detection module. The net CL signal of I increased {{by a factor of}} 3 (compared to purely aqueous test solution of I injected) if the test solution contained 60 % (v/v) of methanol. Optimal order, concentrations and volumes of aspirated zones of reactants were: 61 l of 80 mM Na hexametaphosphate, 60 l of I in 60 % (v/v) methanol, 40 l of 30 mM H 2 SO 4 and 9 l of 0. 5 mM KMnO 4. Calibration curve relating the intensity of CL (peak height) to the concentration of I was linear in the range 1 - 8 M I; the limit of detection (S/N = 3) was 0. 2 M I.
