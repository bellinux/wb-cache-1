60|$|He prospered in his object. No {{movement}} or voice was heard {{when he opened}} the door; no wicked head tied up in a ragged handkerchief looked out of the upper window. When the sun had raised his full disc above the flat line of the horizon, and was striking fire out of the long muddy vista of paved road with its weary avenue of little trees, a <b>black</b> <b>speck</b> moved along the road and splashed among the flaming pools of rain-water, which <b>black</b> <b>speck</b> was John Baptist Cavalletto running away from his patron.|$|E

60|$|A long Indian arm {{stretched}} south. The waiting eyes discerned a <b>black</b> <b>speck</b> on the green, {{and watched}} it grow. A flatboat, with a man standing to the oars, bore down swiftly.|$|E
60|$|She {{stretched}} {{out a long}} arm and pointed. Away in the distance, on the summit {{of a line of}} pebbled shore, standing, as it seemed, sheer over the sea, was a little <b>black</b> <b>speck.</b>|$|E
60|$|Jacob, too, was {{listening}} {{with an air}} of suddenly awakened interest. Up the hill came a <b>black</b> <b>speck,</b> emitting from behind a cloud of smoke and punctuating its progress with the customary series of explosions.|$|E

60|$|Three {{days she}} had lain there, a {{sinister}} <b>black</b> <b>speck,</b> in {{the centre of}} the great sapphire circle of the ocean. Far to the south-east the low blue hills of Hispaniola showed up on the skyline.|$|E
6000|$|Every neck is {{stretched}} further, and every eye strained wider. Away across the endless dead {{level of the}} prairie a <b>black</b> <b>speck</b> appears against the sky, and it is plain that it moves. Well, I should think so! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here's Mangareva," [...] {{the captain}} said, bending {{over the table}} and {{pointing}} to a <b>black</b> <b>speck</b> {{in the midst of}} the white blankness of the chart. [...] "And here, in between, is another island. Why not run for that?" ...|$|E

60|$|This is {{just what}} they did not do. Once out of the inlet, they went about and headed northward, up the coast, and we {{remained}} watching them until Mr. Trevor became a mere oscillating <b>black</b> <b>speck</b> against the sail.|$|E
60|$|He pointed {{along the}} road. Already the clumsy vehicle {{had become a}} <b>black</b> <b>speck</b> in the distance, swaying heavily {{from side to side}} from the pace at which it was being driven, and almost enveloped in a cloud of dust.|$|E
60|$|At length one {{day from}} her lonely point of outlook {{she saw a}} solitary man limping across the plain, a mere <b>black</b> <b>speck</b> {{dragging}} itself forward like a wounded fly upon a wall. Descending from her seat she sought out Sihamba.|$|E
40|$|This NebFact {{addresses}} {{symptoms and}} management of foliar leaf spot diseases in wheat. Foliar leaf spot diseases in wheat occur in spring and summer. Tan spot is characterized by small brown, oval lesions with tan centers early on. Later large tan blotches have a yellow halo. Septoria leaf blotch is characterized by tan irregularly shaped blotches with <b>black</b> <b>specks</b> and a yellow margin. Septoria leaf and glume blotch is characterized by brown irregularly shaped blotches on leaves, purple-brown lesions on glumes and <b>black</b> <b>specks</b> absent from lesions. The disease can be managed through crop rotation and stubble management that leaves a resude cover. Fungicide can be applied following certain criteria...|$|R
