Once hired, they were given unpaid instruction for several months, and then a <b>basic</b> <b>salary</b> that steadily increased as Farsari became satisfied with their work. A capable and loyal colourist could earn twice the rate offered at other Yokohama studios and double his own daily rate for work on Sundays. Colourists also received regular bonuses and gifts. On the other hand, Farsari complained {{in a letter to}} his sister that to motivate his employees he had to rage, swear and beat them, which he did according to a fixed schedule. By 1891 A. Farsari & Co. had 32 employees, 19 of whom were hand-colouring artists.|$|E

40|$|In February 2012, the German Federal Constitutional Court {{declared}} {{the salaries of}} level W 2 professors in the State of Hesse unconstitutional due to their lack of sufficient alimentation power. In the meantime, federal and nearly all state legislators have provided (draft) laws in order to comply in the future with constitutional requirements. In either case, the new salary law still rests upon a dual system containing <b>basic</b> <b>salaries</b> (partly tiered) and a merit bonus component. However, the reform acts provided so far do not succeed in smoothing out existing alimentation deficits of salary law for professors or even create new constitutionally doubtful legal provisions. This is particularly {{due to the fact}} that legislators both miss a sufficient level of <b>basic</b> <b>salaries</b> compared to other public servants and try to cover additional expenses by curtailing given performance bonuses at the same time ("consumption" of old bonuses).

50|$|Although Soviet {{enterprises}} were theoretically {{governed by}} the principle of khozraschet ("accountability")—which required them to meet planners' expectations within the system of set prices for their inputs and outputs—they had little control over the biggest decisions affecting their operations. Managers did {{have a responsibility to}} plan future gross output, which they chronically underestimated in order to later exceed the prediction. The managers then received bonuses (premia) for surplus product regardless of whether it was produced in a cost-effective manner or whether their enterprise was profitable overall. The bonuses for output came in amounts sometimes equal to the managers' <b>basic</b> <b>salaries.</b> The system also incentivized pointless increases in the size, weight, and cost of production outputs, simply because 'more' had been produced.|$|R
