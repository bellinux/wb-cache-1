25|$|The Black Shark torpedo offers {{fibre optic}} wire for {{increased}} bandwidth and signal processing ability compared to copper wire guided torpedo types. The sonar capability include non-doppler shifted target discrimination and multi-frequency capability that features advanced spatial and angular analysis abilities. The design {{goal for the}} torpedo was 300% improvement of passive acquisition and 200% active acquisition with its sonar system. The <b>brushless</b> <b>motor</b> design coupled with the aluminum-silver oxide (Al-AgO) battery gives the system a top speed 50+ knot, {{and a range of}} 50km, performance envelope. Like all other battery powered HWTs, the battery power system does not suffer the loss of performance of Otto fuel II types at greater depths since there is no exhaust to deal with at greater pressures. The result is a 150% improvement in speed and 200% in torpedo endurance.|$|E

50|$|<b>Brushless</b> <b>motors</b> fulfill many {{functions}} originally {{performed by}} brushed DC motors, but cost and control complexity prevents <b>brushless</b> <b>motors</b> from replacing brushed motors {{completely in the}} lowest-cost areas. Nevertheless, <b>brushless</b> <b>motors</b> have come to dominate many applications, particularly devices such as computer hard drives and CD/DVD players. Small cooling fans in electronic equipment are powered exclusively by <b>brushless</b> <b>motors.</b> They {{can be found in}} cordless power tools where the increased efficiency of the motor leads to longer periods of use before the battery needs to be charged.

50|$|<b>Brushless</b> <b>motors</b> {{are found}} in {{electric}} vehicles, hybrid vehicles and personal transporters, which are in essence AC synchronous motors with permanent magnet rotors.

5000|$|ESC {{systems for}} brushed motors are very {{different}} by design; as a result brushed ESC's are not compatible with <b>brushless</b> <b>motors.</b> <b>Brushless</b> ESC systems basically create a tri-phase AC power output of limited voltage from an onboard DC power input, to run <b>brushless</b> <b>motors</b> by sending a sequence of AC signals generated from the ESC's circuitry, employing a very low impedance for rotation. <b>Brushless</b> <b>motors,</b> otherwise called outrunners or inrunners depending on their physical configuration, have become very popular with [...] "electroflight" [...] radio-control aeromodeling hobbyists because of their efficiency, power, longevity and light weight in comparison to traditional brushed <b>motors.</b> <b>Brushless</b> AC <b>motor</b> controllers are {{much more complicated than}} brushed motor controllers.|$|R

50|$|Hub motor {{electromagnetic}} fields are supplied to the stationary windings of the motor. The outer {{part of the}} motor follows, or tries to follow, those fields, turning the attached wheel. In a brushed motor, energy is transferred by brushes contacting the rotating shaft of the motor.

50|$|There is a {{trend in}} the HVAC and {{refrigeration}} industries to use brushless motors instead of various types of AC motors.

50|$|When {{converting}} electricity into mechanical power, <b>brushless</b> <b>motors</b> {{are more}} efficient than brushed motors.
