40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Balloon</b> {{dilatation}} <b>angioplasty</b> {{was successfully}} performed in five patients (ages 18 months to 17 years) with discrete aortic coarctation.

A 10 sec inflation-deflation cycle at 6 to 8 atmospheres (90 to 120 psi) was performed. The systolic pressure gradients across the coarctation before <b>balloon</b> dilatation <b>angioplasty</b> ranged from 35 to 70 mm Hg. Systolic pressure gradients after <b>balloon</b> dilatation <b>angioplasty</b> ranged from 0 to 10 mm Hg. All patients had normalized blood pressure immediately. Abnormal pulsed Doppler echocardiograms were observed in all patients before balloon dilatation angioplasty; four patients had normal echocardiograms after <b>balloon</b> dilatation <b>angioplasty.</b> No serious intraprocedural complications occurred. One patient required femoral artery thrombectomy 36 hr after <b>balloon</b> dilata-tion <b>angioplasty.</b> One to 6 months after <b>balloon</b> dilatation <b>angioplasty</b> no patients have evidence of restenosis of coarctation.

Infarct area and arterial calcium can also be observed (however those require a somewhat higher radiation exposure).

40|$|Abstract Vascular stenoses and {{hypoplasia}} {{in children}} are {{often associated with}} congenital heart disease or occur as a residual lesion or complications after surgical repair. Among these lesions, branch pulmonary artery stenoses are the commonest, other lesions include coarctation of aorta, stenosis of systemic veins after Fontan repairs, post-operative pulmonary venous stenosis, aortopulmonary collateral artery or shunt stenosis and post-operative conduit stenosis. They are usually associated with significant mortality or morbidity if untreated. Conventional surgical repair for these vascular stenoses may be difficult, carries a high operative risk or is associated with disappointing outcome. Some of the lesions may even be surgically inaccessible. <b>Balloon</b> <b>angioplasties</b> may be effective in relieving obstruction {{in some of these}} lesions. It can achieve successful dilation in about 60 % of branch pulmonary arterial stenoses but the success rate may be lower in other lesions. Furthermore, the effects of <b>balloon</b> <b>angioplasties</b> in many lesions are often temporary and restenosis as a result of elastic recoil or subsequent scarring and fibrosis is common. Implantation of a stent provides a firm support and maintain patency of the vessels after balloon dilatation. Both balloon-expandable and self-expanding stents have been used to treat various vascular stenoses but available evidence suggests that the former is more suitable for use in children as it can be redilated to a higher diameter to keep pace with growth and is associated with fewer complications.

[...] Subacute thrombosis rates with intracoronary stents proved to be about 3.7 percent, higher than the rates seen after <b>balloon</b> <b>angioplasty.</b> [...] Post-procedure bleeding was also an issue, due to the intense combination of anticoagulation and anti-platelet agents used to prevent stent thrombosis.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{procedure}} to treat blocked coronary arteries was {{coronary artery bypass}} graft surgery (CABG), wherein a section of vein or artery from elsewhere in the body is used to bypass the diseased segment of coronary artery. In 1977, Andreas Grüntzig introduced percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), also called <b>balloon</b> <b>angioplasty,</b> in which a catheter was introduced through a peripheral artery and a balloon expanded to dilate the narrowed segment of artery. As equipment and techniques improved, the use of PTCA rapidly increased, and by the mid-1980s, PTCA and CABG were being performed at equivalent rates. <b>Balloon</b> <b>angioplasty</b> was generally effective and safe, but restenosis was frequent, occurring in [...] about 30–40% of cases, usually within the first year after dilation. [...] In about 3% of <b>balloon</b> <b>angioplasty</b> cases, failure of the dilation and acute or threatened closure of the coronary artery (often because of dissection) prompted emergency CABGs.|$|E

40|$|Neointimal {{hyperplasia}} essentially {{arises when}} cells posi-tive for smooth muscle markers cross the internal elastic lamina then migrate and proliferate. 1, 2 In human pathology, this process frequently occurs after {{the treatment of}} symptom-atic atherosclerosis, which involves mechanical endovascular <b>ballooning</b> (<b>angioplasty)</b> followed by stenting.

In particular, 17 β-estradiol (E 2), the main endogenous estrogen, has a dual beneficial effect on the 2 facets of vascular healing after angioplasty because it both accelerates endothelial regrowth and inhibits the pro-liferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), which otherwise leads to the narrowing of the arterial lumen (reste-nosis). 4 Consistent with these functions, E 2 {{has been shown to}} prevent neointimal hyperplasia in response to endovascular injury in various animal models and species, including rats, pigs, and sheep, 5 – 7 but this action has not been reported t...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveWe have {{investigated}} whether popliteal artery volume flow (PAVF) measured immediately after <b>balloon</b> <b>angioplasties</b> of the superficial femoral artery–popliteal segments (SFA/POP) was predictive of early (30 days) and mid-term (6 months) arterial thrombosis. MethodsDuring the last 24 months, 203 patients (56 % men) {{with a mean}} age of 73 ± 9 years had 268 duplex-guided <b>balloon</b> <b>angioplasties</b> of the SFA/POP. Critical ischemia was the indication in 36 %. Group I included 176 (66 %) with stenoses, and group II had 92 (34 %) with occlusions. All patients had completion duplex examinations that included three measurements of PAVF of below-the-knee popliteal artery. ResultsEarly (30 days) thrombosis of the treated femoropopliteal arterial segment developed in 10 patients (3. 7 %), three in group I (1. 7 %) and seven in group II (7. 6 %; P <. 04). All 10 cases of early thrombosis were in patients with TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) class C (6 / 185, 3. 2 %) and D (4 / 26, 15 %) lesions. Moreover, the 19 % incidence (n = 4) of early thrombosis in patients with PAVF < 100 mL/min (mean, 73 ± 24 mL/min; range, 20 to 99 mL/min) was higher compared with the 2. 4 % rate for patients with higher flows (mean, 176 ± 60 mL/min; range, 100 to 450 mL/min; P <. 01). At 6 months of follow-up, femoropopliteal occlusions had developed in nine more patients, and it became apparent that low PAVF measurements were still predictive of thrombosis (29 %) when compared with higher PAVF cases (6 %; P <. 002). Log-rank comparison of survival curves for cumulative primary stenosis-free patency in group I and group II demonstrated a statistically significant difference (P <. 02). PAVF < 100 mL/min and TASC classification were significant predictors of early (30 days) and mid-term (6 months) arterial thrombosis after femoropopliteal angioplasties. PAVF was the most powerful predictor of arterial thrombosis. The respective 6 -month and 12 -month limb salvage rates were 98 % and 94 % for patients with claudication and 88 % and 85 % for those with limb-threatening ischemia (P <. 0001). ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that low PAVF is the most powerful predictor of early (30 days) and mid-term (6 months) arterial thrombosis after femoropopliteal interventions. In the presence of a low postprocedure PAVF (< 100 mL/min), one may consider not reversing the heparin or using intermittent calf compression, or both, to augment the arterial flow...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe {{long-term}} patency of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) {{suffers from}} {{a high incidence of}} primary failure due to early thrombosis, myointimal hyperplasia at the venous access site, or failure to mature. A multidisciplinary meeting in vascular access surgery was initiated to optimize the timing, indication, type of intervention, and the logistics of AVFs/AVGs during the preoperative and postoperative period. This study evaluated the influence of the new optimized care protocol on the incidence of revisions (surgical and endovascular) and patency rates. MethodsThis protocol for vascular access surgery of AVFs/AVGs for hemodialysis was introduced in January 2004. It was initiated with the presence of the vascular surgeons, nephrologists, interventional radiologists, dialysis nurses, and the ultrasound technicians. Every patient who needed an AVF/AVG because of long-term treatment of chronic renal failure or awaiting kidney transplantation, or who needed a revision of an AVF/AVG, was discussed. Two groups were compared. Group I patients were treated with an AVF/AVG before the introduction of the new protocol (2001 and 2002). Group II patients were treated with an AVF/AVG after the introduction of the new optimized care protocol (2004 and 2005). Both groups were followed up after 12 months. ResultsDuring the study period, 146 AVFs/AVGs were attempted, and 111 postoperative revisions were performed to restore primary and secondary patency: 63 in group I (60 surgical, 3 radiology) and 48 in group II (23 surgical, 25 radiology). Significantly more segmental access replacements (P < 0. 027) occurred in group I than in group II. Significantly fewer surgical revisions (P < 0. 019) and more endovascular <b>balloon</b> <b>angioplasties</b> (P < 0. 001) occurred in group II. Significantly higher cumulative primary and secondary patency rates of all AVFs/AVGs (P < 0. 001), radial-cephalic direct wrist AVFs (P < 0. 001), and brachial-cephalic forearm looped transposition AVGs (P < 0. 001) were achieved in group II after follow-up.

2500|$|Interventional {{procedures}} have {{been plagued by}} restenosis due {{to the formation of}} endothelial tissue overgrowth at the lesion site.

[...] As assessed in clinical trials during the late 1980 and 1990s, using only <b>balloon</b> <b>angioplasty</b> (POBA, plain old <b>balloon</b> <b>angioplasty),</b> up to 50% of patients suffered significant restenosis; but that percentage has dropped to the single to lower two digit range with the introduction of drug-eluting stents. [...] Sirolimus, paclitaxel, and everolimus are the three drugs used in coatings which are currently FDA approved in the United States. [...] As opposed to bare metal, drug eluting stents are covered with a medicine that is slowly dispersed with the goal of suppressing the restenosis reaction. [...] The key to the success of drug coating has been (a) choosing effective agents, (b) developing ways of adequately binding the drugs to the stainless surface of the stent struts (the coating must stay bound despite marked handling and stent deformation stresses), and (c) developing coating controlled release mechanisms that release the drug slowly over about 30 days. [...] One of the newest innovations in coronary stents is the development of a dissolving stent.

Results: Symptomatic plaques were lighter, less calcified. Plaque weights were inversely correlated to protrusion numbers and diameters of the narrowest segments of stents. Although they did not reach to statistically significant level, plaques having high protrusion numbers were more symptomatic and less calcified.
