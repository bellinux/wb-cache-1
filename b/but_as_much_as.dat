500|$|Jon is a {{prominent}} {{point of view}} character in the novels, and has been called one of Martin's [...] "finest creations". Jon is introduced as the illegitimate son of a Northern lord who, realizing he is an outsider in his own family, follows his uncle to the far north and accepts the honorable duty of serving in the Night's Watch. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he is a second-class Stark at home, initially his fellow recruits and brothers of the Watch set him apart as privileged and aloof. Jon adapts, soon proving himself to be wise, compassionate, and a natural leader. Over {{the course of the}} series, Jon's loyalty to the Watch and its vows, his family, and even Westeros itself are tested as he becomes embroiled in the efforts of the wildlings from Beyond the Wall to force their way back into the Seven Kingdoms. He lives among them as a spy for the Watch, sympathetic to their cause and becoming romantically involved with the tenacious Ygritte. [...] However he ultimately betrays them to defend The Wall. Later, as the newest Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, he pursues an alliance with the wildlings.|$|E
500|$|Brett Ratner {{was hired}} to direct in September 2002, {{originally}} expressing an interest in casting an unknown for the lead role, while filming was to start sometime in late 2003. Christopher Reeve joined as project consultant, citing Tom Welling, who portrayed the teenage Clark Kent in Smallville, as an ideal candidate. Reeve added [...] "the character {{is more important than}} the actor who plays him, because it is an enduring mythology. It definitely should be an unknown." [...] Ratner approached Josh Hartnett, Jude Law, Paul Walker and Brendan Fraser for Superman, but conceded that finding a famous actor for the title role had proven difficult because of contractual obligations to appear in sequels. [...] "No star wants to sign that, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I've told Jude and Josh my vision for the movie, I've warned them of the consequences of being Superman. They'll live this character for 10 years because I'm telling one story over three movies and plan to direct all three if the first is as successful as everyone suspects." [...] Hartnett in particular was offered $100million for a three-picture deal. Walker explained that [...] "I could have made a gazillion dollars on that franchise. I could probably have bought my own fleet of jets or my own island. You know what? I don't need it." [...] David Boreanaz, Victor Webster and Ashton Kutcher auditioned, along with Keri Russell as Lois Lane, but Kutcher decided not to pursue the role, citing scheduling conflicts with That '70s Show, the Superman curse and fear of typecasting, while Boreanaz had to back out due to obligations with Angel. James Marsden stated in a 2006 interview that at one point he was approached by Ratner. Although it was never formally announced, Matt Bomer confirmed he was in the running for the lead role, being Ratner's preferred choice at the time. Bomer would later voice the character in the 2013 animated film [...] Amy Adams had also auditioned for Lois Lane, and would eventually win the role eight years later when she was cast in Man of Steel.|$|E

[...] In many ways, he is a gleaner of his own work, which he files away {{with the possibility of}} revisiting it in the future. ... <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he revives material after recontextualizing it, most fundamental to the vitality of [...] repertory is not what the movement looks like or even what the words say, but the beguiling way in which they fit together. [...] He is a director who knows dance. [...] And even though there is a bit of everything in his work [...] humor, musicality, lush movement [...] he is unpredictable. (Gia Kourlas, 2002) ...|$|E

At least, Eliot said it was a compliment, and I always take the opinion of great men like college presidents on all such subjects as that.|$|E

I trust my friend Dombey will not allow his mind to be too much preyed upon, by any mere loss of fortune. I cannot say that I have ever experienced any very great loss of fortune myself: never having had, in point of fact, any great amount of fortune to lose. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I could lose, I have lost; and I don't find that I particularly care about it. I know my friend Dombey to be a devilish honourable man; and it's calculated to console my friend Dombey very much, to know, that this is the universal sentiment. Even Tommy Screwzer,--a man of an extremely bilious habit, with whom my friend Gay is probably acquainted--cannot say a syllable in disputation of the fact.' ...|$|E
60|$|I woke up {{and became}} aware that some one was pouring water down my throat. Heaven! I thought to myself, for at that time heaven and water were synonymous in my mind.

The starlight was {{extraordinarily}} clear in that pure desert atmosphere, and by it I saw the face of Sergeant Quick bending over me. Also, I saw Orme sitting up, staring about him stupidly, while a great yellow dog, with a head like a mastiff, licked his hand. I knew the dog at once; it was that which Orme had bought from some wandering natives, and named Pharaoh because he ruled over all other dogs. Moreover, I knew the two camels that stood near by. So I was still on earth--unless, indeed we had all moved on a step.|$|E

And let others pretend what they will, I believe it impossible to be otherwise with anybody. There can be no substantial satisfaction in a life of known wickedness; conscience will, and does often, break in upon them at particular times, let them do what they can to prevent it.|$|E
60|$|In that cave {{also are}} found human bones, crusted {{with a very}} thick, stony coating, and wise men have ventured to say that those men not only lived before the flood, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> ten {{thousand}} years before it. It may be true--it looks reasonable enough--but as long as those parties can't vote anymore, the matter can be of no great public interest. In this cave likewise are found skeletons and fossils of animals that exist {{in every part of}} Africa, yet within memory and tradition have never existed in any portion of Spain save this lone peak of Gibraltar! So the theory is that the channel between Gibraltar and Africa was once dry land, and that the low, neutral neck between Gibraltar and the Spanish hills behind it was once ocean, and of course that these African animals, being over at Gibraltar (after rock, perhaps--there is plenty there), got closed out when the great change occurred. The hills in Africa, across the channel, are full of apes, and there are now and always have been apes on the rock of Gibraltar--but not elsewhere in Spain! The subject is an interesting one.|$|E
60|$|As {{there is}} no place in Darwinism for free will, or any other sort of will, the Neo-Darwinists held that {{there is no}} such thing as {{self-control}}. Yet self-control is just the one quality of survival value which Circumstantial Selection must invariably and inevitably develop in the long run. Uncontrolled qualities may be selected for survival and development for certain periods and under certain circumstances. For instance, since it is the ungovernable gluttons who strive the hardest to get food and drink, their efforts would develop their strength and cunning in a period of such scarcity that the utmost they could do would not enable them to over-eat themselves. But a change of circumstances involving a plentiful supply of food would destroy them. We see this very thing happening often enough in the case of the healthy and vigorous poor man who becomes a millionaire by one of the accidents of our competitive commerce, and immediately proceeds to dig his grave with his teeth. But the self-controlled man survives all such changes of circumstance, because he adapts himself to them, and eats neither as much as he can hold nor as little as he can scrape along on, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> is good for him. What is self-control? It is nothing but a highly developed vital sense, dominating and regulating the mere appetites. To overlook the very existence of this supreme sense; to miss the obvious inference that it is the quality that distinguishes the fittest to survive; to omit, in short, the highest moral claim of Evolutionary Selection: all this, which the Neo-Darwinians did in the name of Natural Selection, shewed the most pitiable want of mastery of their own subject, the dullest lack of observation of the forces upon which Natural Selection works.|$|E

Well, he always walks to his office with a wery {{handsome}} gold watch-chain hanging out, about {{a foot and a}} quarter, and a gold watch in his fob pocket as was worth--I'm afraid to say how much, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a watch can be--a large, heavy, round manufacter, as stout for a watch, as he was for a man, and with a big face in proportion. [...] "You'd better not carry that 'ere watch," [...] says the old gen'l'm'n's friends, [...] "you'll be robbed on it," [...] says they. [...] "Shall I?" [...] says he. [...] "Yes, you will," [...] says they. [...] "Well," [...] says he, [...] "I should like to see the thief as could get this here watch out, for I'm blessed if I ever can, it's such a tight fit," [...] says he, [...] "and wenever I vants to know what's o'clock, I'm obliged to stare into the bakers' shops," [...] he says. Well, then he laughs as hearty as if he was a-goin' to pieces, and out he walks agin with his powdered head and pigtail, and rolls down the Strand with the chain hangin' out furder than ever, and the great round watch almost bustin' through his gray kersey smalls. There warn't a pickpocket in all London as didn't take a pull at that chain, but the chain 'ud never break, and the watch 'ud never come out, so they soon got tired of dragging such a heavy old gen'l'm'n along the pavement, and he'd go home and laugh till the pigtail wibrated like the penderlum of a Dutch clock. At last, one day the old gen'l'm'n was a-rollin' along, and he sees a pickpocket as he know'd by sight, a-coming up, arm in arm with a little boy with a wery large head. [...] "Here's a game," [...] says the old gen'l'm'n to himself, [...] "they're a-goin' to have another try, but it won't do!" [...] So he begins a-chucklin' wery hearty, wen, all of a sudden, the little boy leaves hold of the pickpocket's arm, and rushes head foremost straight into the old gen'l'm'n's stomach, and for a moment doubles him right up with the pain. [...] "Murder!" [...] says the old gen'l'm'n. [...] "All right, Sir," [...] says the pickpocket, a-wisperin' in his ear. And wen he come straight agin, the watch and chain was gone, and what's worse than that, the old gen'l'm'n's digestion was all wrong ever afterwards, to the wery last day of his life; so just you look about you, young feller, and take care you don't get too fat.' ...|$|E
