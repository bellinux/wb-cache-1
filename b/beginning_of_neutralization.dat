40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) neutralization occurs when specific antibodies, mainly those {{directed against the}} envelope glycoproteins, inhibit infection, most frequently by preventing the entry of the virus into target cells. However, the precise mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>neutralization</b> remain unclear. Previous studies, mostly with cell lines, have produced conflicting results involving either the inhibition of virus attachment or interference with postbinding events. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>neutralization</b> by immune sera and compared the inhibition of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) infection by HIV- 1 primary isolates (PI) with the inhibition of T-cell line infection by T-cell line-adapted (TCLA) strains. We followed the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>neutralization</b> to determine at which step of the viral cycle the antibodies act. We found that <b>neutralization</b> <b>of</b> the TCLA strain HIV- 1 MN/MT- 4 required an interaction between antibodies and cell-free virions before the addition of MT- 4 cells, whereas PI were neutralized even after adsorption onto PBMC. In addition, the dose-dependent inhibition of HIV- 1 MN binding to MT- 4 cells was strongly correlated with serum-induced neutralization. In contrast, neutralizing sera did not reduce the adhesion of PI to PBMC. Postbinding inhibition was also detected for HIV- 1 MN produced by and infecting PBMC, demonstrating that the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>neutralization</b> depends on the target cell used in the assay.

40|$|Although CD 4 + T {{cells are}} {{generally}} accepted {{to be responsible}} for the determination of resistance to infection in experimental murine cutaneous leishmanlasis, a contribution of CD 8 + lymphocytes to immunity can be demonstrated under certain well-defined conditions. Normally highly susceptible BALB/c mice can be rendered resistant to infection with Leishmania major promastigotes by a single injection of monoclonal anti-CD 4 antibodies at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> infection. Mice treated in such a way can heal their primary cutaneous lesions and acquire immunity to subsequent challenge infection. Both the resolution of the primary infection and the induced state of immunityto reinfection in these mice is shown to be dependent upon the anti-leishmanial effector functions of CD 8 + T cells. Furthermore, in contrast to control infected BALB/c mice, which are unable to mount a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to viable parasites, mice cured as a result of treatment with anti-CD 4 antibodies in vivo exhibit a strong DTH response, which can be significantly reduced by injection of either anti-CD 4 or anti-CD 8 monoclonal antibodies prior to antigenic challenge with viable promastigotes. Moreover, increased numbers of specific CD 8 + T cells, able to transferLeishmania-specific DTH responses, were found in lymphold organs of BALB/c mice rendered resistant to infection by immunointervention with anti-CD 4 monoclonal antibodies at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> infection. <b>Neutralization</b> in vivo <b>of</b> interleukin 4 during the course of infection in BALB/c mice also enables these otherwise susceptible mice to resolve their cutaneous lesions and to decrease the parasite burden in infected tissues.
