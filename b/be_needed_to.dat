5|$|Scientists are {{investigating}} ways {{to harness the}} wind energy within the jet stream. According to one estimate, of the potential wind energy in the jet stream, only 1 percent would <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> meet the world's current energy needs.

5|$|Typically, Othnielosaurus {{has been}} {{interpreted}} like other hypsilophodonts as a small, swift herbivore, although Bakker (1986) interpreted the possibly related Nanosaurus as an omnivore. This idea has had some unofficial support, but little in the formal literature; description of more complete skull remains will <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> test this hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} judges, {{including}} Efraín Rivera Pérez, a former {{judge of the}} Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, and Héctor Laffitte, former federal judge, expressed themselves {{in favor of the}} amendments. Also, former two-time Superintendent of the Puerto Rico Police Department, Pedro Toledo, expressed himself in favor of the amendments. He added that some guidelines could <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> allow judges to define the issue of the dangerousness of the accused.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surrender}} of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, {{the primary reason for}} manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Col. Alexander, chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Fort Stanton fell into the first-class category, as it was thought that the fort would <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> defend the Washington Navy Yard.|$|E

5|$|As an {{offshoot}} of Boeing's MX-2145 manned boost-glide bomber project, Boeing partnered with RAND Corporation in January 1954 to explore what sort of bomber aircraft would <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> deliver the various nuclear weapons then under development. At the time, nuclear weapons weighed several tons, {{and the need to}} carry enough fuel to fly that payload from the continental United States to the Soviet Union demanded large bombers. They also concluded that after release of bombs the aircraft would need supersonic speed to escape the critical blast-radius.|$|E
5|$|Because TAPS {{hoped to}} begin laying pipe by September 1969, {{substantial}} orders were placed for steel pipeline 48inches (122cm) in diameter. No American company manufactured pipe of that specification, so three Japanese companies—Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., Nippon Steel Corporation, and Nippon Kokan Kabushiki Kaisha—received a $100 million contract {{for more than}} 800 miles (1280km) of pipeline. At the same time, TAPS placed a $30 million order {{for the first of}} the enormous pumps that would <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> push the oil through the pipeline.|$|E
5|$|Eruptions {{would likely}} {{continue}} {{for a period}} of time, followed by years of decreasing secondary activity. The solidifying lava would occasionally collapse portions of the volcano to create pyroclastic flows. Rubble on the flanks of the volcano and in valleys would occasionally be released to form debris flows.

30|$|PET {{studies with}} [11 C]flumazenil in epileptic rats <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> clarify whether local changes in {{cerebral}} [11 C]flumazenil uptake in epilepsy {{are due to}} decreased GABA-ergic function, P-gp upregulation, or both. Furthermore, a comparison between naive and epileptic rats <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> assess to which degree P-gp upregulation affects cerebral uptake of [11 C]flumazenil. Ultimately, [11 C]flumazenil studies in both pharmacoresistant and pharmacosensitive patients with epilepsy, {{as well as in}} healthy volunteers <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> elucidate this important issue.|$|R
5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the mechanisms that would <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> create patterns in living organisms, in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.|$|E
5|$|In February 1965 the Army asked Bell to {{consider}} different deployment concepts under the Nth Country study. This examined {{what sort of}} system would <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> provide protection against an unsophisticated attack with {{a limited number of}} warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The system would be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, but that was not a concern for a system that would only be tasked with beating off small attacks.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Suillus americanus has {{a similar}} appearance, but a more easterly distribution. It is {{associated}} with eastern white pine. Although some authors have tried {{to distinguish between the}} two with by using width of the stem, or by differences in fruit body colouration, it is acknowledged that these characteristics are variable, and depend on environmental factors. The phylogenetic analysis of Wu and colleagues (2000) suggests that the two taxa may be the same, although more samples from different geographical areas will <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> verify this.|$|E

During the previous year, Macdonald had met with potential railway financiers such as Hugh Allan and considerable financial discussion took place. Nevertheless, the greatest political problem Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, which had not yet been debated in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|On 12 January 2009, {{at least}} three people, {{including}} two Mexicans and one American, entered the Parque-Museo La Venta in Villahermosa and damaged just under 30 archaeological pieces, including the four La Venta colossal heads. The vandals were all members of an evangelical church and {{appeared to have been}} carrying out a supposed pre-Columbian ritual, during which salts, grape juice, and oil were thrown on the heads. It was estimated that 300,000 pesos (US$21,900) would <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> repair the damage, and the restoration process would last four months. The three vandals were released soon after their arrest after paying 330,000 pesos each.|$|E
5|$|STAC {{stated that}} an SST would have {{economic}} performance similar to existing subsonic types. Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, {{they would be}} able to fly more sorties in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.|$|E

Three spacecraft were envisioned; a manned spacecraft to transport crew to the stations, a manned spacecraft with a cargo module for both crew and cargo delivery, and a dedicated unmanned spacecraft to resupply the station {{every three or four}} months.|$|E
5|$|Seymour Cray {{began the}} design of the Cray-3 in 1985, as soon as the Cray-2 reached production. Cray {{generally}} set himself the goal of producing new machines with ten times the performance of the previous models. Although the machines did not always meet this goal, this was a useful technique in defining the project and clarifying what sort of process improvements would <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> meet it. For the Cray-3, he decided to set an even higher performance improvement goal, an increase of 12x over the Cray-2.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{stated that}} it wished to run up to four multichannels at {{different}} times of the day or alternatively offer an HDTV service.

Other interested parties, such as internet service provider OzEmail argued for the provision of spectrum for interactive services, while Telstra, shareholder in the subscription television provider Foxtel, supported ASTRA's argument for a competitive bidding process for digital spectrum.|$|E
