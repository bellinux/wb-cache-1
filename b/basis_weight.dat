30|$|Before production, the {{moisture}} regains of wood pulp and Danufil were respectively measured, and then, {{the raw materials}} (wood pulp and Lyocell) were prepared according to the required blend ratios (60 / 40, 70 / 30, and 80 / 20). Regarding the pulping, the beating consistency was controlled at 3 – 5 %, the pressure difference between inlet and outlet of disc mill was set at 0.1  MPa, and the beating degree was controlled at 12.5 °– 15.5 ° SR. Meanwhile, Lyocell fibers were evenly dispersed in water. Next, wood pulp and Lyocell were blended to form slurry concentration, which needed to be controlled at 0 – 0.08 %. The homogenous wetlaid nonwovens with different <b>basis</b> <b>weights</b> were formed in the wet machine by the distributor, as illustrated in Fig.  1 a.

50|$|India {{paper is}} a type of paper which from 1875 has been based on {{bleached}} hemp and rag fibres, that produced a very thin, tough opaque white paper. It has a <b>basis</b> <b>weight</b> of 20 pounds, yet bulks 1,000 pages to the inch.|$|E
50|$|Greaseproof {{paper is}} paper that is {{impermeable}} to oil or grease and is normally used in cooking or food packaging. Normally greaseproof paper {{is produced by}} refining the paper stock and thus create a sheet with very low porosity. This sheet is supercalendered to further improve the density, creating a paper called glassine. The glassine is treated with starches, alginates or CMC in a size press to fill pores or treat the paper chemically to make it fat repellent. <b>Basis</b> <b>weights</b> are usually 30-50 g/m².|$|R
5000|$|Facial {{tissue and}} paper {{handkerchiefs}} {{are made from}} the lowest <b>basis</b> <b>weights</b> tissue paper (14 18 g/m2). The surface is often made smoother by light calendering. These paper types consist usually of 2-3 plies. Because of high quality requirements the base tissue is normally made entirely from pure chemical pulp, but might contain added selected recycled fiber. The tissue paper might be treated with softeners, lotions or added perfume {{to get the right}} properties or [...] "feeling". The finished facial tissues or handkerchiefs are folded and put in pocket-size packages or a box dispenser.|$|R
5000|$|The {{base paper}} for paper cups are called [...] "cup board" [...] and {{are made on}} special {{multi-ply}} paper machines and have a barrier coating for waterproofing.

The mouth roll forming process requires good elongation properties {{of the board and}} the plastic coating. A well formed mouth roll provides good stiffness and handling properties in the cup. The <b>basis</b> <b>weights</b> of the cup boards are 170-350 g/m2.|$|R

5000|$|In {{countries}} that use US paper sizes, a less direct measure known as <b>basis</b> <b>weight</b> {{is used in}} addition to or instead of grammage. The <b>basis</b> <b>weight</b> of paper is the density of paper {{expressed in terms of}} the mass of a ream of given dimensions and a sheet count. In the US system, the weight is specified in avoirdupois pounds and the sheet count of a paper ream is usually 500 sheets. However, the mass specified is not the mass of the ream that is sold to the customer. Instead, it is the mass of the uncut [...] "basis ream" [...] in which the sheets have some larger size. Often, this is a size used during the manufacturing process before the paper was cut to the dimensions in which it is sold. So, to compute the mass per area, one must know ...|$|E
