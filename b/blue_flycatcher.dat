5000|$|During Boy Blue's {{recovery}} from the injury caused by the enchanted arrow {{he had been shot}} with during [...] "War and Pieces", <b>Blue</b> told <b>Flycatcher</b> about how naive he was being about Red Riding Hood's feelings for him, and that he felt the two should get together.Soon after that, Flycatcher was quick to notice that Blue's arm had turned gangrenous and infected, despite his previous apparent recovery. When Blue was eventually taken to the Farm after the fall of Fabletown to Mr. Dark, his wound now seriously infected by the dark magic contained within the witching cloak (which was originally a sack carried by Mr. Dark), Flycatcher attempted to use the magic given to him by Haven and the Sacred Grove to heal Blue. However, this attempt failed, and Flycatcher was reduced to tears as he told everyone to say their last goodbyes to his best friend.Blue died the next morning and was buried in Haven on the hill overlooking the baseball field there.|$|R
50|$|The paradise flycatchers are {{generally}} small birds, around 18 to(-) 21 cm {{in length and}} weighing 12 to(-) 23 g. They have a medium length grey or blueish bill which is broad and hooked {{at the end and}} is surrounded by stiff rictal bristles. The inside of the mouths of paradise-flycatchers are brightly coloured, being either yellow or green. The tails are long, particularly in many species where the male has a massively elongated pair of middle tail feathers. These tail streamers are 195 mm long in the male São Tomé paradise flycatcher and 412 mm long in the male Indian paradise flycatcher. The function of the long tail is assumed to be related to sexual selection, with females choosing males based on the length of the tail. Not all species have long tail streamers, for example the <b>blue</b> paradise <b>flycatcher</b> of Palawan in Asia and the Bedford's paradise flycatcher of montane Africa do not have exceptionally long tails. In most species the tail is longer than the wing, even in the shorter tailed females. The eye is surrounded by an eyering that is a blue thin wattle (slightly more pronounced in some species like the rufous paradise flycatcher).|$|R

The survey found 10 endangered species recorded in the IUCN Red List including the red winged crested cuckoo, Malabar pied hornbill and pale harrier. The area is home to 15 endemic species including the black-and-orange flycatcher. It recorded 138 species of birds including 17 species that were newly observed in the Silent Valley area.

500|$|Along with Ohiya, Pattipola and Ambewela, Horton Plains forms {{one of the}} Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Together {{with the}} {{adjacent}} Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, Horton Plains contains 21 bird species which occur only on Sri Lanka. Four, Sri Lanka <b>blue</b> magpie, dull-blue <b>flycatcher,</b> Sri Lanka white-eye, and Sri Lanka wood pigeon, occur only in Horton plains, while other endemic species [...] include Sri Lanka spurfowl, Sri Lanka junglefowl, yellow-fronted barbet, orange-billed babbler, Sri Lanka bush warbler, and Sri Lanka whistling-thrush. Many birds migrate here in winter including swiftlets, and alpine swift. Crested serpent eagle, mountain hawk-eagle, black-winged kite, and peregrine falcon are among the birds of prey found in Horton Plains. Harriers are among the migratory raptors. This is a key wildlife area. All six highland endemic birds are found here, including dull-blue flycatcher, Sri Lanka white-eye, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, and Sri Lanka bush warbler. Yellow-eared bulbul and black-throated munia are widespread throughout the highlands.|$|R
50|$|The peacock butterfly's main anti-predator defence {{mechanism}} {{comes from the}} four large eyespots that it has on its wings. These eyespots are brilliantly coloured concentric circles. Like many other butterflies that hibernate, the peacock butterfly exhibits many lines of defence against would-be predators. Avian predators of the butterfly include <b>blue</b> tits, pied <b>flycatchers</b> and other small passerine birds. The first line of defence against these predators for many hibernating butterflies is crypsis, {{a process in which}} the butterflies blend into their environment by mimicking a leaf and staying immobile. Some hibernating butterflies such as the peacock have a second line of defence: when attacked, they open their wings, expose their eyespots and perform an intimidating display of threat. The intimidating visual display shown by the peacock butterfly gives it a much better chance at escaping predators than butterflies that rely solely on leaf mimicry. While the main targets of these anti-predation measures are small passerine birds, even larger birds such as chickens have been shown to react to the stimuli and avoid the butterfly when exposed to eyespots.|$|R

50|$|HNWR {{is located}} within the Central Flyway, a route {{traveled}} annually by numerous species of waterfowl and other migratory birds. The refuge enjoys {{a reputation as a}} premier bird watching destination in North Texas. Although a total of 316 bird species have been recorded on the refuge since it was established in 1946, recent surveys show 273 different bird species are regularly found at HNWR, of which 80 species nest and 193 are migratory. Painted buntings, cardinals, scissor-tailed <b>flycatchers,</b> <b>blue</b> grosbeaks, eastern meadowlarks, northern mockingbirds, blue jays, and red-bellied woodpeckers are common nesting birds. Neotropical migrants such as warblers, tyrant flycatchers, tanagers, orioles, sparrows, and others pass through them each spring and fall with many of these species remaining to nest. Game birds on the refuge include the mourning dove, northern bobwhite and wild turkey. Many declining species either occasionally or commonly occur on the refuge including the American golden plover, prothonotary warbler, painted bunting and Hudsonian godwit. The refuge attracts 15 species of raptors during the fall and spring migration period including the osprey, rough-legged buzzard and Swainson's hawk, hen harrier, sharp-shinned hawk and Cooper's hawk. The refuge provides excellent wintering habitat for bald eagles, particularly along Lake Texoma. Nesting raptors include the red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, hen harrier, Mississippi kite, American kestrel, and the broad-winged hawk.|$|R
40|$|Summary Secondary hole-nesting {{birds that}} do not {{construct}} nest holes themselves and hence regularly breed in nest boxes constitute important model systems for field studies in many biological disciplines with hundreds of scientists and amateurs involved. Those research groups are spread over wide geographic areas that experience considerable variation in environmental conditions, and researchers provide nest boxes of varying designs that may inadvertently introduce spatial and temporal variation in reproductive parameters. We quantified the relationship between mean clutch size and nest box size and material after controlling {{for a range of}} environmental variables in four of the most widely used model species in the Western Palaearctic: great tit Parus major, blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus, pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca and collared flycatcher F. albicollis from 365 populations and 79 610 clutches. Nest floor area and nest box material varied non-randomly across latitudes and longitudes, showing that scientists did not adopt a random box design. Clutch size increased with nest floor area in great tits, but not in <b>blue</b> tits and <b>flycatchers.</b> Clutch size of blue tits was larger in wooden than in concrete nest boxes. These findings demonstrate that the size of nest boxes and material used to construct nest boxes can differentially affect clutch size in different species.
