5|$|Even {{following}} the conversion to cylindrical smokeboxes, {{it was still}} possible to distinguish some non-streamliners from ex-streamliners. On the former (Nos. 46230-46234 and 46249-46252, but not 46253-46257) the running plates veered downwards {{at right angles to}} connect with the <b>buffer</b> <b>beam</b> {{in the style of the}} Princess Royal Class. The ex-streamliners did not have any such connection, except No.46242 City of Glasgow which was rebuilt in 1952 following a serious collision.|$|E
5|$|As {{members of}} the Uand U1classes, rebuilds were used mainly on mixed-traffic as well as {{secondary}} passenger duties on lines between the main routes. They were used all over the Southern Railway network, but were little-used over the steep track gradients west of Exeter. The smaller-wheeled Nclass was preferred amongst crews for the same duties, as high-speed running was rare away from the main lines in the West Country. Heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid's Unrebuilt Light Pacifics, which were within weight restrictions in this area. The 21 rebuilt locomotives entered British Railways service in 1948. From 1955 a few were given replacement frames at overhaul: these had a shallower curve between the front <b>buffer</b> <b>beam</b> and the smokebox.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} the class entered British Railways service in 1948, and from 1955 23 of the U class {{received}} chimneys of the British Railways Standard Class 4 variety and replacement cylinders, which had become worn through intensive use. A few {{members of the}} class were given replacement frames at overhaul with a shallower curve between the front <b>buffer</b> <b>beam</b> and smokebox. During the early 1960s, the withdrawal of the ageing T9 class designed by Dugald Drummond saw the U class replacing them on services west of Exeter, though their large wheels offered little advantage on the steeper gradients that characterised this part of the railway network. The favoured form of 2-6-0 motive power west of Exeter was the smaller-wheeled N class, while heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid’s Unrebuilt Light Pacifics, which were within the weight restrictions imposed in this area. The U class represented one of the less glamorous classes of passenger locomotive {{due to the fact that}} they were used mainly on mixed-traffic and secondary passenger duties.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were painted}} dark green lined out with red between two cream lines. The <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> were painted red. In {{the days of}} the Great Southern Railways the locomotives were painted in a plain grey livery, the <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> being red.|$|R
50|$|The Class 34-200 {{were all}} {{delivered}} in the SAR Gulf Red livery with signal red <b>buffer</b> <b>beams,</b> yellow side stripes on the long hood sides and a yellow V on each end. In the 1990s they began to be repainted in the Spoornet orange livery with a yellow and blue chevron pattern on the <b>buffer</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tralee and Dingle {{locomotive}} livery was a {{dark green}} lined out red between two cream lines. <b>Buffer</b> <b>beams</b> were red. Following the 1925 amalgamation the livery followed that of the GSR in that locomotives were painted plain grey with red <b>buffer</b> <b>beams.</b> It carried this livery, in common with other TDLR locos, on into CIÉ days, retaining it (though in filthy condition!) to the end.|$|R
5|$|The main visual {{difference}} between the Kand K1classes was at the front end: the K1 incorporated a vertical metal cover above the front <b>buffer</b> <b>beam</b> to protect the third cylinder and associated Holcroft valve gear assembly from the elements. It also featured a new cab design with redesigned single front spectacle plates, {{and a pair of}} substantially constructed steps were fitted behind both outside cylinders to provide access to the running plate. The lack of a middle cylinder on the Kclass locomotives had allowed the provision of a footplate that curved from the buffers to the water tanks. The K1 prototype emerged from Ashford works as No.A890, and underwent trials from 1 December 1925 before entering regular service. Only one locomotive of the K1class was built; plans to build a further ten (Nos.A891-A900) alongside a batch of five N1class 2-6-0s were cancelled after the Sevenoaks accident in August 1927. Following rebuilding as a 2-6-0 tender locomotive in 1928, No.A890 was reclassified U1 and was the forerunner of twenty more basically similar locomotives built in 1931.|$|E
25|$|K 192: State Coal Mine, Wonthaggi, Victoria Painted all-over {{black with}} red under the {{locomotive}} footplate, but with black <b>buffer</b> <b>beam.</b> For a time, the engine wore {{the identity of}} K 170.|$|E
25|$|The side {{valances}} of the locomotives in streamlined form were {{prone to}} {{damage in the}} event of collision with trackside objects. During 1950, the valances were shortened to end at the <b>buffer</b> <b>beam</b> rather than extending {{to the base of the}} cowcatcher.|$|E
50|$|On {{introduction}} the T26 locomotives {{were painted}} in the standard GER livery of Ultramarine Blue over an undercoat of French Grey, with black smokebox and vermillion <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> and lining. From 1915 locos were not given a top coat and ran in French Grey undercoat but with the boiler bands picked out in black. After the amalgamation of the GER into the LNER in 1923 (the Grouping), the E4s received the LNER mixed traffic livery of black with single red lining and red <b>buffer</b> <b>beams.</b> This lasted until the early 1940s when unlined black with red <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> was introduced, and the surviving locos were to carry this livery until their withdrawal.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicles}} were 13380 mm long over the coupler faces and 12496 mm across the <b>buffer</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|R
50|$|During World War II, the {{locomotives}} {{were painted}} black with red <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> and number plate and name plate backgrounds providing relief.|$|R
25|$|When the Highland Railway {{was created}} in 1865 it {{acquired}} the locomotives of its constituent companies, nearly all {{of which had been}} built under the supervision of William Barclay. In these early years locomotives were painted a dark green with numbers on the <b>buffer</b> <b>beam.</b>|$|E
25|$|Non-stop London to Edinburgh train runs had {{previously}} {{featured in the}} British Transport Films (BTF) production Elizabethan Express filmed {{in the summer of}} 1953, hauled by the LNER A4 Class No. 60017 Silver Fox, and the BBC's own film of the 1968 anniversary run. For the 2009 film Tornado was fitted with multiple miniature cameras around the locomotive and inside the cab, and using one front-mounted camera attached to the red <b>buffer</b> <b>beam,</b> raising the possibility of any footage gained being used to produce a modern-day version of the famous 1952 BTF film London to Brighton in Four Minutes, a four-minute long speeded up view of the railway route from London to Brighton as viewed {{from the front of the}} Brighton Belle.|$|E
25|$|K 190: Owned by VicTrack and {{operated}} by Steamrail Victoria, and as of September 2017 it is operating on the Victorian Goldfields Railway in Maldon. It is regularly used on suburban shuttles and on day tours to Geelong and similar-length trips. When first restored in 1977 at Bayswater and Newport, the engine was painted in a two-tone green livery; this lasted until 1992, after which the engine was returned to a plain black livery. In 1995, she was leased to the South Gippsland railway, and that organisation gave a simpler version of the green livery, using apple green on the boiler, cab, tender and cylinders (with limited dark green lining), red buffer beams both ends, and matt black frames and wheels. By 4th Nov 2000 the engine had returned to Steamrail in Melbourne, and been repainted gloss black; by Easter of 2001 the front <b>buffer</b> <b>beam</b> had been repainted red. The engine spent some time around 2010 on the Maldon railway. On Saturday 12 March 2016, the engine was restored to service in a new crimson with yellow, black and red livery, {{along the same lines}} as the R 766's previous livery. Both were inspired by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway's crimson lake livery.|$|E
50|$|The Class 91-000 {{were all}} {{delivered}} in the SAR Gulf Red livery with signal red <b>buffer</b> <b>beams,</b> yellow side stripes on the long hood sides and a yellow V on each end. In the 1990s they began to be repainted in the Spoornet orange livery with a yellow and blue chevron pattern on the <b>buffer</b> <b>beams.</b> Only one was repainted in the Spoornet blue livery with outline numbers on the long hood sides in about 2006.|$|R
5000|$|The class 33-000 were {{delivered}} in the new Gulf Red livery with yellow side-stripes on the long hood, a yellow V on each end, signal red <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> and unpainted steel cowcatchers. Most of them wore this livery throughout their SAR service life. In the Spoornet era, some of those leased to other countries were painted in a maroon livery with yellow and blue chevron <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> and inscribed [...] "Spoornet Traction" [...] on the long hood sides.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, {{the engines}} were painted unlined black. Only the red <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> and number plate {{backgrounds}} relieved the somber effect.|$|R
500|$|Before {{entering}} service, the batch {{was attached}} to [...] tenders to increase operational range over the Southern Railway's long Western section routes. Despite this advantage, tenders fitted to the eight left-hand drive examples were intended for use with right-hand drive locomotives. This resulted in {{the location of the}} fireman's fittings on the [...] "wrong" [...] side of the cab. The design also necessitated the addition of a step to the footplate, as the boiler backhead was lower than the fall-plate that connected the tender and cab floors. The new batch incorporated a new set of footsteps beneath the front <b>buffer</b> <b>beam,</b> modified slide-bars and the dome was redesigned to incorporate the regulator to ease access during routine maintenance.|$|E
500|$|The new {{locomotives}} {{were completed}} between March and November 1930. They were noticeably {{different from the}} prototype because the Holcroft conjugation mechanism above the outside cylinders was omitted, although the slab-front and angled profile of the outside cylinders was retained. Other variations included a set of footsteps beneath the front <b>buffer</b> <b>beam,</b> reversion to the Nclass cast chimney design and a revised dome that incorporated the regulator to ease access during routine maintenance. Once complete, Nos. A876A880 were attached to flat-sided [...] tenders to increase operational range over the Southern Railway's longer Eastern section routes. No further N1 locomotives were ordered {{after the completion of}} No.A880 as the mechanically similar U1class was capable of undertaking a broader range of tasks. Although intended for intermediate passenger work, the latter's [...] driving wheels were of little disadvantage when used on slower freight duties.|$|E
500|$|A {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} locomotive was the high-set Nclass boiler, which was pitched [...] above the frames to accommodate the inside cylinder assembly, potentially exposing the conjugation mechanism to the elements. To prevent corrosion, Maunsell incorporated a vertical metal cover above the front <b>buffer</b> <b>beam</b> to protect the inside cylinder and valve gear assembly, the main visual difference from the Nclass. Maunsell and Holcroft anticipated that the standard Nclass chimney would choke the exhaust blast produced by the three cylinders. To mitigate this, a wider-diameter blastpipe was cast for the locomotive and a new smokebox fabricated to accommodate a wide-diameter cast chimney. The rest of the construction process followed the 1919 N1 specification, and the final {{three members of the}} order for 15 Nclass locomotives were built as intended. The N1 prototype was completed in December 1922 and attached to a standard Maunsell [...] flat-sided Ashford Nclass tender. It entered service on 24 March 1923 and the boiler pressure was reduced from [...] to [...] for No.822's fuel consumption to be compared with that of the 2-cylinder Nclass during trials.|$|E
50|$|The class 32-400 {{were all}} {{delivered}} in the Gulf Red livery with yellow side-stripes on the long hood, a yellow V on each end, signal red <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> and unpainted steel cowcatchers. Most of them wore this livery throughout their SAR service life. In the Spoornet era at least one was painted in Spoornet orange livery with yellow and blue chevron <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> and in the Transnet Freight Rail era at least one was painted in its red, green and yellow livery.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, all the narrow-gauge engines {{were painted}} unlined black. Only the red <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> and number plate {{backgrounds}} relieved the somber effect.|$|R
50|$|All over black, red <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> {{with numbers}} in shaded digits. Lettered NCC on side tank, cast number plate with red {{background}} applied to bunker sides.|$|R
500|$|The first Southern livery {{continued}} {{that of the}} LSWR, {{though with}} primrose yellow transfers showing [...] "Southern" [...] and the locomotive number, placed on the tender. The lining separating the black border on tender and cab side panels was changed to yellow. Primrose yellow transfers, showing [...] "Southern" [...] and the locomotive number, {{were placed on the}} tender. An [...] "E" [...] prefix was located above the tender number (e.g. E749), denoting that the class was registered for maintenance at Eastleigh works. The gilt numerals on the cabside and tender rear were replaced by a cast oval plate with [...] "Southern Railway" [...] around the edge and the number located in the centre. Yellow numerals were painted onto the front <b>buffer</b> <b>beam</b> to ease identification. In February 1925 Maunsell developed a deeper green with black and white lining. This was applied to his new King Arthur class locomotives and the [...] "Urie N15s" [...] were similarly painted when overhauls were due. Wheels were olive-green with black tyres. From 1929 the [...] "E" [...] prefix was removed and the cast numerals on the tender rear were removed and replaced with yellow transfers (e.g. 749).|$|E
2500|$|Tornado is {{numbered}} 60163, as the 50th Peppercorn A1. Tornados smokebox door {{also carries}} the identification plate [...] "51 A", the code for Darlington shed. The cab side carries the builder's plate [...] "No. 2195 Darlington 2008". The front <b>buffer</b> <b>beam</b> carries the designation [...] "A1", {{applied in the}} paint detailing phase for launch in apple green.|$|E
2500|$|European {{locomotives}} usually use [...] "plate frames", {{where two}} vertical flat plates form the main chassis, {{with a variety}} of spacers and a <b>buffer</b> <b>beam</b> at each end to keep them apart. When inside cylinders are mounted between the frames, the plate frames are a single large casting that forms a major support. The axleboxes slide up and down to give some sprung suspension, against thickened webs attached to the frame, called [...] "hornblocks".|$|E
50|$|The <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> are impact {{absorbing}} and {{are relatively}} simply replaced - {{for example in}} the case of them being damaged by over enthusiastic shunting operations.|$|R
25|$|When {{introduced}} the P class locomotives were painted in overall black with red <b>buffer</b> <b>beams,</b> {{in keeping with}} WAGR livery policies of the time. The Pr class wore both the overall black livery and a paint scheme with black smoke boxes, tenders and cabs with grey boilers lined in black. The W class of 1951 {{introduced the}} larch green with black smoke boxes and red <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> livery to Western Australia and this {{was applied to the}} majority of tender locomotives, including the P and Pr classes.|$|R
50|$|All the Class 7E3, Series 1 {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} in the SAR red oxide livery with signal red <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> and cowcatchers, yellow whiskers and with the number plates on the sides mounted on three-stripe yellow wings. In the 1990s {{some of them were}} repainted in the Spoornet orange livery with a yellow and blue chevron pattern on the <b>buffer</b> <b>beams</b> and cowcatchers. In the late 1990s many were repainted in the Spoornet blue livery with either solid or outline numbers on the long hood sides.|$|R
2500|$|The {{rebuilding}} process {{involved the}} removal of the side water tanks, the rear coal bunker and the trailing axles. [...] In featuring similar components to the U class, the U1 was similar in profile, although a slab-front was incorporated above the front <b>buffer</b> <b>beam</b> to house the third cylinder and associated valve gear assembly between the frames. Nevertheless, the U1 retained the [...] driving wheels and general cab layout of the U class, and the Maunsell [...] tender previously used on the N class locomotives, with No. A890 entering revenue-earning service in June 1928.|$|E
2500|$|Named after {{lieutenant}} governor Henry Brougham Loch and beloved {{by many as}} their [...] "favourite" [...] engine on the railway, As originally built [...] "Loch" [...] was a small boilered locomotive, but she was rebuilt as a medium boilered locomotive in 1909. [...] This gave her the same tractive effort as Nos 10 and 11. [...] No. 4 has the strange distinction of being what must surely be the first locomotive ever to (re)enter service {{on the day the}} line closed. Having been earmarked for re-boilering in 1967 by the 1968 season she was ready for service and steam tests were carried out accordingly. Fate intervened however {{and at the end of}} September 1968 the Peel and Ramsey lines closed for good. Fortunately, the Port Erin line was retained and No. 4 was familiar to many as the south based engine for many years, right up until her withdrawal from service after the 1995 Christmas services on the railway. She is the only locomotive to carry a non functioning [...] "bell-mouth" [...] dome and a non-standard livery of maroon was carried from 1979 to withdrawal. Of course, now she wears the familiar Indian red but is distinguished from her shed-mates by carrying a Legs Of Mann and [...] "4" [...] numeral on her <b>buffer</b> <b>beam.</b> She was used heavily in the marketing campaign for the 1993 [...] "Year Of Railways" [...] when she was the locomotive chosen to haul special services on the Manx Electric Railway. Following the Un-Loch Your Cash appeal by the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association in 1998–2000, she returned to service in 2002 and was a regular fleet member once more. On 20 May 2008, she collided with a van and badly damaged her <b>buffer</b> <b>beam.</b> [...] The boiler certificate expired on 31 August 2015 and following that day's services the locomotive with withdrawn from traffic; it is not known when it is likely to return.|$|E
2500|$|Britain did not adopt bright {{headlights}} as {{they would}} affect night vision and so could mask the low-intensity oil lamps used in the semaphore signals and {{at each end of}} trains, increasing the danger of missing signals, especially on busy tracks. Locomotive stopping distances were also normally much greater than the range of headlights, and the railways were well-signalled and fully fenced to prevent livestock and people from straying onto them, largely negating the need for bright lamps. Thus low-intensity oil lamps continued to be used, positioned on the front of locomotives to indicate the class of each train. Four [...] "lamp irons" [...] (brackets on which to place the lamps) were provided: one below the chimney and three evenly spaced {{across the top of the}} <b>buffer</b> <b>beam.</b> The exception to this was the Southern Railway and its constituents, who added an extra lamp iron each side of the smokebox, and the arrangement of lamps (or in daylight, white circular plates) told railway staff the origin and destination of the train. On all vehicles, equivalent lamp irons were also provided on the rear of the locomotive or tender for when the locomotive was running tender- or bunker-first.|$|E
50|$|When {{introduced}} the P class locomotives were painted in overall black with red <b>buffer</b> <b>beams,</b> {{in keeping with}} WAGR livery policies of the time. The Pr class wore both the overall black livery and a paint scheme with black smoke boxes, tenders and cabs with grey boilers lined in black.
