40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate several chili pepper hybrids whith high yielding character and stable at six environments based on some non-parametric stability analyses, and to study the correlation among the stability of non-parametric methods. The hybrid of chili pepper (7 candidates varieties and 5 commercial hybrid cultivars) were grown in a randomized complete block design with 3 replications in 6 different environments. Ten nonparametric stability methods were used to identify the stable genotypes.  According to the SI(3), RS, NPi(1), NPi(2), NPi(3) and NPi(4) stability parameters, Imperial was the most stable hybrid. According to the SI(1), SI(2) and TOP  stability parameters and yield, IPB CH 3 was the most stable hybrid.  In this study, the high TOP values were associated with the yield. Nonetheless, the results of the other non parametric (SI(6), NPi(3) and NPi(4)) were negatively correlated to the yield. The results also revealed that based on the non parametric stability test, the results could be classified into 2 groups, according to the agronomic and <b>biological</b> <b>stabilities.</b>   Keywords: chili pepper, environment, non-parametric stability, yiel...|$|R

30|$|The social zeitgeber theory {{suggests}} that irregular circadian rhythms lead to mood episodes in vulnerable individuals (Grandin et al. 2006).

High initial stability (ISQ values of 70 and above) tends to not increase with time, even if the high mechanical stability will decrease {{to be replaced by}} a developed <b>biological</b> <b>stability.</b> Lower initial stability will normally increase with time due to the lower mechanical stability being enforced by the bone remodeling process (osseointegration).

A significant decrease in ISQ indicates a potential problem and should be considered an early warning.|$|E

40|$|Composting, mechanical-biological {{treatment}} (MBT), biodrying and biostabilization {{processes of}} pre-selected organic fraction from {{municipal solid waste}}s (OFMSW) have recently become important in municipal solid waste management. Through these treatment processes the potential impacts of the produced wastes and the volume to treat in the landfill are strongly reduced. However, the residual organic matter contained in the treated fraction may provide negative effects when e. g. the treated OFMSW is used as compost. The <b>biological</b> <b>stability</b> degree of the treated matrix provides usefull informations for the final use of it. Indeed, knowing the degree of <b>biological</b> <b>stability</b> of the compost makes possible to evaluate, for example, the re-growth of patogenous or the fitotossicity of the matrix.

In this work, a massive estimation of indices suitable for the measurement of <b>biological</b> <b>stability</b> of the organic matter content in solid waste samples has been carried out. Samples from different stages in a mechanical-biological treatment (MBT) plant treating municipal solid wastes (MSW) were selected as examples of different stages of organic matter stability in waste biological treatment. Aerobic indices based on respiration techniques properly reflected the process of organic matter biodegradation. Static and dynamic respirometry showed similar values in terms of aerobic biological activity (expressed as oxygen uptake rate, OUR), whereas cumulative oxygen consumption was a reliable method to express the <b>biological</b> <b>stability</b> of organic matter in solid samples.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of soil organic matter (SOM) in C storage and provision of ecosystem services, the magnitude {{and direction of the}} response of SOM to climate change remains debated. Particularly contested is the role of biochemical recalcitrance in determining the <b>biological</b> <b>stability</b> of SOM, which in turn, may also vary with climate. Employing a climosequence study design controlling for confounding pedogenic factors, the research described in this thesis aimed to uncover the response of both SOM chemistry and SOM <b>biological</b> <b>stability</b> to changes in climate and associated land use shifts at the grassland-forest ecotone in west-central Saskatchewan. Characterization of SOM chemistry was achieved using two advanced analytical techniques: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS). Agreements between XANES and Py-FIMS revealed only minor differences in SOM chemistry resulting from a 0. 7 °C mean annual temperature (MAT) gradient and associated broad differences in land use, but revealed a clear influence of depth within soil profiles. In contrast, long-term aerobic incubations revealed that <b>biological</b> <b>stability</b> of SOM varied with both climate and climate-induced differences in land use, but was not largely influenced by depth. Together, these findings suggest a decoupling of SOM chemistry and its <b>biological</b> <b>stability,</b> indicating that factors other than biochemical recalcitrance are the primary drivers of SOM persistence in these soils...|$|E

40|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>stability</b> of {{drinking}} water refers {{to the concept of}} providing consumers with drinking water of same microbial quality at the tap as produced at the water treatment facility. However, uncontrolled growth of bacteria can occur during distribution in water mains and premise plumbing, and can lead to hygienic (e. g. development of opportunistic pathogens), aesthetic (e. g. deterioration of taste, odour, colour) or operational (e. g. fouling or biocorrosion of pipes) problems. Drinking water contains diverse microorganisms competing for limited available nutrients for growth. Bacterial growth and interactions are regulated by factors such as (i) type and concentration of available organic and inorganic nutrients, (ii) type and concentration of residual disinfectant, (iii) presence of predators such as protozoa and invertebrates, (iv) environmental conditions such as water temperature, and (v) spatial location of microorganisms (bulk water, sediment or biofilm). Water treatment and distribution conditions in water mains and premise plumbing affect each of these factors and shape bacterial community characteristics (abundance, composition, viability) in distribution systems. Improved understanding of bacterial interactions in distribution systems and of environmental conditions impact is needed for better control of bacterial communities during drinking water production and distribution. This article reviews (i) existing knowledge on <b>biological</b> <b>stability</b> controlling factors and (ii) how these factors are affected by drinking water production and distribution conditions. In addition, (iii) the concept of <b>biological</b> <b>stability</b> is discussed in light of experience with well-established and new analytical methods, enabling high throughput analysis and in-depth characterization of bacterial communities in drinking water.
