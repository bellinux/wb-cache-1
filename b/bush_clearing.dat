The late mowing seems rather ineffective. The grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful.

Common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing.

It is sometimes accidentally harvested due to its similarity to the closely related and coexisting Peyote (Lophophora williamsii). Other contributing factors are thought to be urban development and herbicides. Habitat destruction has been, and remains, the major cause of the decline in this species; vast areas have been converted to agricultural use and road construction.

50|$|Tāwhiao and {{his people}} moved southwards, into the {{territory}} of the Ngāti Maniapoto, the area of New Zealand that is still known as the King Country. He was a pacifist, or perhaps he was simply a realist who recognized the futility of trying to fight the Colonial government. For the next twenty years he lived an itinerant lifestyle, travelling among his people in Taranaki and Maniapoto settlements reminding them that war always had its price and the price was always higher than expected. He considered himself the anointed leader of a chosen people wandering in the wilderness. But he also predicted that the Māori people would find justice and restitution for the wrongs they had suffered. He preached that Kingites should keep separate from Pakeha. He was strongly against Maori children going to school to get an education. As a result, when the railway went through Kingite territory Kingites were only able to get unskilled jobs such as <b>bush</b> <b>clearing.</b> This strong anti education stance started a Kingite tradition that led to increasing isolation and lower standard of living than Maori experienced elsewhere in New Zealand. It was not until {{after the turn of the}} century that Kingites were finally persuaded to abandon their hatred of formal education in schools.|$|E

As we watched, two little brown men walked together out of the bush and down amongst the baboons. They were certainly not any known monkey and yet they must have been akin or they would have disturbed the baboons. They were too far away to be seen in great detail, but these small human-like animals were probably between four and five feet tall, quite upright and graceful in figure. At the time I was thrilled as they were quite evidently no beast of which I had heard or read. Later a friend and big game hunter told me he was in the Portuguese East Africa with his wife and three hunters, and saw a mother, father and child, apparently of the same species, walk across the further side of the <b>bush</b> <b>clearing.</b> The natives loudly forbade him to shoot."

40|$|Savannah {{ecosystems}} exhibit constant transitions {{between states}} dominated by trees and states {{dominated by a}} combination of trees and grasses. Transitions between these states are driven by interactions between fire and herbivory. Bush encroachment (i. e. an increase in the density of woody vegetation) is often caused by anthropogenic disturbance such as climate change, invasive plants, fire control and livestock practices. Since bush encroachment alters the dynamics between fire and herbivory, it may have significant impact on savannah ecosystems. Two of the most common measures to mitigate bush encroachment are prescribed burning and <b>bush</b> <b>clearing</b> by mechanical treatments. We studied the effects of these two mitigation measures on ungulate space use in Lapalala Wilderness, a private conservation area within the Waterberg Biosphere Reserve, northern South Africa. Burning and <b>bush</b> <b>clearing</b> affected both the overall abundance and the species composition of ungulates at particular patches, but these effects were influenced by habitat and the type of <b>bush</b> <b>clearing</b> treatment. Contrary to our expectations, most species occurred less frequently in burnt patches, and also less frequently in patches that had been bush cleared. Our results suggest that combined effects of fire and <b>bush</b> <b>clearing</b> may have positive effects on grazers and negative effects on browsers. Although our sampling design did not allow us to fully resolve interactive effects of burning and <b>bush</b> <b>clearing</b> treatments across habitats, our study highlights {{the fact that there are}} complex ecological consequences of habitat alterations in savannah ecosystems.
