2500|$|Poor trimming, shoe selection, or {{inappropriate}} shoe attachment are well-known {{causes of}} lameness, and navicular disease is fairly {{common in the}} modern-day domesticated horse. However, it is also seen in wild horse populations. Those who advocate [...] "barefoot trimming" [...] of domestic horses propose that in nature, a horse's hoof is designed to expand and contract as the horse moves. This expanding and contracting acts as an auxiliary <b>blood</b> <b>pump,</b> and aids the circulation of blood to the lower extremities. When an inflexible metal shoe is improperly attached to the hoof, the hoof can no longer work as designed, and blood flow is inhibited. However, evidence of navicular degeneration {{has been established in}} the fossil record of early horses. Mary Thompson, a vertebrate paleontologist at Idaho Museum of Natural History, has found evidence in many species of early horses and concludes, [...] "The results of this study strongly suggest that man’s intervention (whether by increased usage or improper breeding practices) may not be the sole cause of the syndrome", although she cautions that her results are preliminary.|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the needs and}} requirements {{in the development of}} rotary <b>blood</b> <b>pumps,</b> we have to consider the current use and limitations of <b>blood</b> <b>pumps</b> in cardiac surgery. There are 5 different fields of indications for <b>blood</b> <b>pumps</b> in cardiac surgery. First, there is the possibility to use rotary <b>blood</b> <b>pumps</b> in the cardiopulmonary bypass system. Second, miniaturized rotary <b>blood</b> <b>pumps</b> can be used to support beating heart surgery.

50|$|From {{a medical}} standpoint, the {{importance}} of studying the viscoelastic properties of blood becomes evident.

50|$|The {{explanation}} why {{the heart}} is capable of adapting to growing volumes of blood flow is called 'Frank-Starling’s mechanism', which says that the more distended are the muscle during the filling, the more strength of contraction and quantity of <b>blood</b> <b>pumped</b> by the left-ventricle to the aorta. When the heart reaches a physiological limitation, then <b>blood</b> <b>pumping</b> cannot increase, although the venous return is further increased.

40|$|Heart {{attack and}} stroke {{are among the}} leading causes of death in {{industrial}} nations {{but the number of}} candidates needing a transplant exceeds the number of transplants performed. Due to this chronic shortage, <b>blood</b> <b>pumps</b> are needed to deliver appropriate hydraulic performance while maintaining physiological flow conditions. Because all known artificial materials are considered to be thrombogenic to some extent it is necessary to investigate the interaction of flow and material in complex geometries to optimize modern <b>blood</b> <b>pumps</b> and other artificial organs. As human blood is a precious fluid, designers of rotational <b>blood</b> <b>pumps</b> desire reliable predictive thrombosis models to optimize the physiological compatibility of their devices. In this thesis, the initial development stage of a model for platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation is described. Model equations and methods for their numerical solution are presented.

40|$|The most {{important}} bio-prosthetic organs in cardiovascular medicine are artificial heart valve prostheses and <b>blood</b> <b>pumps.</b> Cardiac valve prostheses {{can be divided}} in 'mechanical' and 'biological' valves. Mechanical prostheses are entirely made of artificial materials and require a meticulous anticoagulation therapy. The biological heart valves or heterografts (the allo- and autografts are not considered in this issue) are made of fixed or crosslinked biological tissue and therefore anticoagulation of the patient is not necessary. Actual mechanical heart valves consist of a titanium ring in which one or more leaflets made of pyrolite carbon assure the opening and closing mechanism. Biological heart valves are made of fixed porcine aortic valves or of fixed bovine pericardium. Both tissues can be mounted on a metal frame (so-called 'stented valves') or they can lack this structure ('stentless valves'). The problem with these biological valves is the durability: during the years they start degenerating or calcifying. To prevent this, recent biological heart valves are treated with an anti-mineralisation procedure. Since recent years intense research is ongoing to develop a living heart valve by 'tissue engineering'. When the entire heart fails, and pharmacological treatment remains inadequate or a heart transplantation is not immediately possible, artificial <b>blood</b> <b>pumps</b> are implanted. In general, two categories of <b>blood</b> <b>pumps</b> can be distinguished: displacement and rotary <b>blood</b> <b>pumps.</b> Displacement pumps move {{a certain amount of}} blood by the movement of a flexible membrane. This movement is pneumatically or electrically driven and requires an extensive installation: artificial ventricles, tubing, motors, pneumatic systems and driving consoles. Examples in clinical use are: Novacor, Heart Mate, Thoratec, Medos/HIA. Recent developments focus on miniaturisation and endovascular implantation. The rotary <b>blood</b> <b>pumps</b> are well suited for these purposes. They can be either axial, diagonal or radial pumps. A promising new develoment is the Impella pump: this is an axial flow pump having a diameter of 4 mm, which is implanted, inclusive the electrical motor, in the failing heart and delivers an output of 2 to 10 liter/minute. Clinical testing of this device is ongoing. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|People who are {{to undergo}} DHCA surgery {{are placed on}} {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass (CPB), a procedure that uses an external heart-lung machine that can artificially replace {{the function of the}} heart and lungs. A portion of the circulating blood supply is removed and stored for later replacement, with the remaining blood diluted by added fluids with the objective of reducing viscosity and clotting tendencies at cold temperature. The remaining diluted blood is cooled by the heart-lung machine until hypothermia causes the heart to stop beating normally, after which the <b>blood</b> <b>pump</b> of the heart-lung machine continues blood circulation through the body. Cardioplegic drugs may be administered to ensure the heart stops beating completely (asystole), which is protective of both the heart and brain when circulation is later stopped. Cooling continues until the brain is also inactivated by cold, and electrocerebral silence (flatline EEG) is attained. The <b>blood</b> <b>pump</b> is then switched off, and the interval of circulatory arrest begins. At this time more blood is drained to reduce residual blood pressure if surgery on a cerebral aneurysm is to be performed.|$|E
50|$|With slow {{continuous}} therapies, {{the blood}} flow rates are {{usually in the}} range of 100-200 ml/min, and access is usually achieved through a central venous catheter placed in one of the large central veins.

Native access for hemodialysis (e.g. AV fistulas or grafts) are unsuitable for CHF because the prolonged residence of the access needles required might damage such accesses.|$|E

40|$|The {{function}} of pulsatile <b>blood</b> <b>pumps</b> {{is very similar}} to that of the natural heart: the blood chamber expands and contracts analog to the ventricle while inflow and outflow valves direct the blood flow. Initially, the valves used in <b>blood</b> <b>pumps</b> were the valves that were being developed for the replacement of the diseased natural valves. The patient with an implanted artificial valve is often endangered by thrombo-embolic complications. These complications are caused by a complex interaction between blood, material of the valve and the flow. The specific causal flow phenomenon is flow separation. In flow separation, the platelets, the thrombus generating blood cells, come into extended contact with the foreign material and may deposit and aggregate to a thrombus. Therefore th...|$|R
40|$|Rotary <b>blood</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used}} for cardiac assist and {{cardiopulmonary}} support since mechanical blood damage is less than with conventional roller pumps. The high shear rate in the rotary pump and the reduced anticoagulation of the patient during prolonged pumping enforces high demands on the biocompatibility of the materials in the pump {{in order to prevent}} thrombus formation. Materials with a very hydrophobic character appear to adsorb much thrombin and induce a conformational change of fibrinogen, resulting in a surface with a high affinity for platelet interaction. Furthermore, heigh shear forces of 120 dyne-s-cm(2) in rotary pumps induce platelet release and platelet aggregation.
