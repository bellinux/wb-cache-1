5|$|Outside of his career, Mountfort was keenly {{interested}} {{in the arts and}} a talented artist, although his artistic work appears to have <b>been</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> art pertaining to architecture, his first love. He was a devout member of the Church of England and a member of many Anglican church councils and diocese committees.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{dating from}} St-Calais' {{time is the}} confraternity {{relationship}} between the monks of Durham and the monks of the monastery of Saint Calais in Maine. The cult of Saint Calais appears to have <b>been</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> the region around the monastery which the saint had founded. St-Calais {{appears to have been}} a devotee of the cult, and the most likely date for the creation of the confraternity link between the two houses is during St-Calais' time as bishop.|$|E
5|$|Recurring {{injuries}} between 2001 and 2003 {{continued to}} disrupt Berger's career and deprived {{him of a}} presence in the first team, resulting in his decision to leave Liverpool after the expiration of his contract following the conclusion of the 2002–03 season. Berger had <b>been</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> the bench for the duration of his final season when selected, limiting him to four appearances. He left Liverpool, having scored 35 goals during his seven seasons with the club.|$|E

5|$|Rotavirus B, {{also called}} adult {{diarrhoea}} rotavirus or ADRV, has caused major epidemics of severe diarrhoea affecting {{thousands of people}} of all ages in China. These epidemics occurred as a result of sewage contamination of drinking water. Rotavirus B infections also occurred in India in 1998; the causative strain was named CAL. Unlike ADRV, the CAL strain is endemic. To date, epidemics caused by rotavirus B have <b>been</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> mainland China, and surveys indicate a lack of immunity to this species in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The finals of {{the first}} Italian Football Championship was decided {{in a single day}} with four teams competing, three from Turin and one from Genoa. The title was decided using a {{knock-out}} format between the finalists with Genoa, the inaugural winners. The knock-out format was used until the 1909–10 season, when a league consisting of nine teams was formed. The championship, which had <b>been</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> a single league in the north of Italy, became a national competition in 1929 with the foundation of Serie A and Serie B.|$|E
5|$|In Iberia, the Christian states, {{which had}} <b>been</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> the {{north-western}} {{part of the}} peninsula, began to push back against the Islamic states in the south, a period known as the Reconquista. By about 1150, the Christian north had coalesced into the five major kingdoms of León, Castile, Aragon, Navarre, and Portugal. Southern Iberia remained under control of Islamic states, initially under the Caliphate of Córdoba, which broke up in 1031 into a shifting number of petty states known as taifas, who fought with the Christians until the Almohad Caliphate re-established centralised rule over Southern Iberia in the 1170s. Christian forces advanced again in the early 13th century, culminating in the capture of Seville in 1248.|$|E

5|$|In 1796, {{after three}} years of the French Revolutionary Wars, Spain and the French Republic signed the Treaty of San Ildefonso. The secret terms of this treaty {{required}} Spain to renounce its alliance with Great Britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally. In the East Indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant British forces in the region were faced with the threat of attack from the Spanish Philippines to the east. Britain dominated the East Indies in 1796, controlling the trade routes through the Indian Ocean from the ports of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. Dutch Ceylon, the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies had been captured in 1795, and the French presence in the region had <b>been</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> Île de France and a few subsidiary islands in the Western Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The 5th Division {{replaced}} the US 40th Infantry Division on New Britain during October and November 1944 and continued the New Britain Campaign {{with the goals}} of protecting Allied bases and confining the large Japanese force on the island to the area around Rabaul. In late November the 5thDivision established bases closer to the Japanese perimeter and began aggressive patrols supported by the Allied Intelligence Bureau. The division conducted amphibious landings at Open Bay and Wide Bay {{at the base of the}} Gazelle Peninsula in early 1945 and defeated the small Japanese garrisons in these areas. By April the Japanese had <b>been</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> their fortified positions in the Gazelle Peninsula by the Australian force's aggressive patrolling. The 5th Division suffered 53fatalities and 140 wounded during this campaign. After the war it was found that the Japanese force was 93,000 strong, which was much higher than the 38,000 which Allied intelligence had estimated remained on New Britain.|$|E
5|$|These {{reforms were}} also {{significant}} {{in that they}} gave to Senate committees the role of examining the budget (what {{is referred to as}} the estimates process or estimates hearings), which had hitherto <b>been</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> the Senate and its committee of the whole. The role of the committees was enhanced by three subsequent developments. First, in 1982 the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was established, which, in examining all bills, played a role that complemented that of the examination of all delegated legislation by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Second, in 1989 the Senate adopted procedures for the systematic referral of bills to committees, increasing the level of legislative scrutiny taking place within parliament. Third, in 1993, the committees adopted a more extensive procedure for consideration of the budget, creating a second opportunity each year for Senators to follow up issues identified during the initial budget estimates hearings. These second hearings are referred to as supplementary budget estimates. Though the committee system was restructured in 1994, 2006 and again in 2009, the range of functions has remained essentially the same.|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Lomé Agreement, UNAMSIL set up disarmament camps throughout Sierra Leone that were intended to disarm the Sierra Leone Army, the RUF, and the militia groups operating in the country. The SLA and some militia groups began to enter the camps but the RUF did not. In April 2000, 10 members of the RUF entered a UNAMSIL camp without {{the knowledge of the}} RUF's leadership. Upon locating its fighters, the RUF demanded their return. The military observers refused, and the RUF responded by besieging the camp and attacking other UNAMSIL bases in the area. They took large numbers of UN personnel prisoner, and then began to advance into areas previously controlled by the Sierra Leone government. On 3 May, the RUF took control of the town of Kambia. Foreign diplomats in the country estimated that the RUF could be in Freetown within a week, since the SLA had <b>been</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> barracks and had handed over most of its weapons in {{accordance with}} the Lomé Agreement. The United Nations issued a statement condemning the violence, after which Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the British representative to the UN that it expected the United Kingdom, as the former colonial power, to intervene in Sierra Leone directly, rather than relying on the international community.|$|E
