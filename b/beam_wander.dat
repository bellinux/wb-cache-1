5000|$|Every {{laser beam}} wanders and jitters — albeit a small amount. The typical {{kinematic}} tip-tilt mount drifts by around 100 μrad {{per day in}} a laboratory environment (vibration isolation via optical table, constant temperature and pressure, and no sunlight that causes parts to heat). A laser beam incident upon this mirror will be translated by 100 m at a range of 1000 km. This could {{make the difference between}} hitting or not hitting a communications satellite from Earth. Hence, {{there is a lot of}} interest in characterizing the <b>beam</b> <b>wander</b> (slow time scale) or jitter (fast time scale) of a laser beam. The <b>beam</b> <b>wander</b> and jitter can be measured by tracking the centroid or peak of the beam on a CCD beam profiler. The CCD frame rate is typically 30 frames per second and therefore can capture beam jitter that is slower than 30 Hz — it can’t see fast vibrations due to one’s voice, 60 Hz fan motor hum, or other sources of fast vibrations. Fortunately, this is usually not a great concern for most laboratory laser systems and the frame rates of CCDs are fast enough to capture the <b>beam</b> <b>wander</b> over the bandwidth that contains the greatest noise power. A typical <b>beam</b> <b>wander</b> measurement involves tracking the centroid of the beam over several minutes. The rms deviation of the centroid data gives a clear picture of the laser beam pointing stability. The integration time of the beam jitter measurement should always accompany the computed rms value. Even though the pixel resolution of a camera may be several micrometres, sub-pixel centroid resolution (possibly tens of nanometer resolution) is attained when the signal to noise ratio is good and the beam fills most of the CCD active area.|$|E

40|$|The {{main effects}} of {{atmospheric}} turbulence on the laser beams propagation are scintillation, <b>beam</b> <b>wandering,</b> and phase front distortion. The first two can be compensated simply by using aperture averaging, whereas the later, which is of high importance in high data rates free space optics communications, is much more complex. This paper gives a review of principal analytical methods used to simulate and characterize the optical beam propagation through the turbulence channel focussing on phase front distortion. The paper presents simple models suitable for computer simulations of <b>beam</b> <b>wandering</b> and scintillation. This is followed by more complex theoretical approaches in analysing the turbulence induced phase front distortion and the calculation of the mutual coherence function of partially coherent beams propagating through an inhomogeneous medium.

One strategy to overcome this limitation consists in using a separate wavelength {{from that of the}} quantum signal to analyze the <b>beam</b> <b>wander</b> and use this information for its correction. For this strategy to work adequately, both wavelengths should be affected equally by atmospheric turbulence, i. e. no chromatic effects should be originated from <b>beam</b> <b>wander.</b> In this letter, a series of experiments are performed to prove that this is the case for λ 850 nm as the quantum signal and λ 1550 nm as the tracking signal of a quantum communication system.

30|$|The entire {{regions of}} the OPD are equally divided into six sub-regions, and the {{corresponding}} Q-factor and average BER values are measured and discussed. The FSOC performance improvements due to the <b>beam</b> <b>wandering</b> mitigation system are evaluated in controller turned off and on conditions. The values of the ESI are estimated and brought down to the controlled range of 0 to 0.15. The <b>beam</b> <b>wandering</b> range of − 0.13 to + 0.16  mm, maximum of 55  dB disturbance band attenuation with a frequency range of 0  Hz through 2  kHz, Q-factor of 6, and BER of 6.45 [*]×[*] 10 − 9 are achieved due to the incorporation of the developed neural controller in different real-world environmental conditions. The results {{presented in this paper}} are intended for setting up the FSOC transceiver. So, it is suggested that the use of the neural controller for fine steering applications is best instead of complex/complicated computational algorithms found in literature. This control scheme can also be used in various applications like beam stabilization, steering, focusing, beam spotting, beam coupling and real-time control system, etc. A new version of the neural controller for deformable mirror control is also being implemented in FPGA and will be finished in the near future.|$|R

30|$|Wavefront {{distortion}} due to spatio-temporal {{variation of}} refractive index due to turbulence leads to <b>beam</b> <b>wander,</b> 13 {{the same effect}} that limits astronomical seeing. The shower curtain effect [79, 80] means that the <b>beam</b> <b>wander</b> for an orbit to ground transmission will be smaller that for a ground to space transmission for the same atmospheric turbulence [61]. Since the optical beacon and downlink photons take similar paths, separated by the velocity aberration angle, this will partially cancel out the effect of <b>beam</b> <b>wander</b> {{as long as the}} OBT detection and BSM bandwidth is greater than the timescale of the turbulence. The magnitude of the nearly common path rejection will depend {{on the size of the}} turbulent cells compared with the beam displacement between up and down-going beams which, at the top of the stratosphere, is a maximum of 3  m at zenith and reduces to zero as the satellite approaches the horizon.|$|E

30|$|Recent {{and rapid}} {{progress}} in {{information and communication}} technology has exceeded our expectations for meeting the requirements of multimedia society in the twenty-first century. Free-space optical communication (FSOC) {{is considered to be}} one of the key technologies for realizing very high speed multigigabit per second (multi-Gb/s) large-capacity terrestrial and aerospace communications [1, 2]. The FSOC system provides a line of sight (LoS), wireless and high-bandwidth communication between remote sites. The FSOC system offers many transmission advantages including freedom from electromagnetic interference (EMI) and license or tariffs, flexibility, ease in installment, no need to dig up roads, last-mile access, service acceleration, metro network extensions, enterprise connectivity, fiber backup, backhaul, and high security [3, 4]. In addition, a photonics-based approach is expected to bring such ultra-high data rate wireless technologies to potential users and to meet and explore real-world applications at the earliest opportunity as a technology driver [5]. However, the propagating optical wave is influenced in the FSOC channel by random atmospheric changes (wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, and pressure) [6], thermal expansion, weak earthquakes, and typical high-rise building sways which result in decreasing the average received power, increasing the bit error rate (BER), and severely degrading the communication link quality/reliability [7 – 9]. These are all the general problems that require attenuation to be dealt with. The major effects due to the random fluctuations of the atmospheric turbulence are (i) optical scattering and observation (characterized by atmospheric attenuation); (ii) random optical power fluctuation (characterized by scintillation index); (iii) <b>beam</b> <b>wandering,</b> i.e., <b>beam</b> surface global (temporal) tilt due to beam centroid displacement on the detector plane (characterized by effective scintillation index); and (iv) wavefront distortions, i.e., beam surface (spatial) local tilt (characterized by the Zernike polynomials) [10 – 12]. The conventional data coding and/or modulation techniques can be used to equalize/compromise the first two effects with respect to weather conditions at a given instant of time [13, 14]. The third and fourth effects cannot be compromised without incorporating the adaptive optics elements [15, 16]. During data transmission, the angle between the transmitter-receiver LoS and the transmitting beam axis must be kept within a fraction of the transmitting beamwidth which may be as small as a few microradians. The increase in the transmitting beam divergence angle/diameter is one way to maintain the link between the transmitter and receiver. It is clear that an overly wider beam will increase the required laser power, which increases the terminal cost and complexity. On the other hand, an overly narrow beam may result in a cutoff of the communication when there is building sway and/or <b>beam</b> <b>wandering</b> [2, 3, 7, 8]. The existence of a perfect LoS and continuous beam alignment between the communicating optical antennas is one of the key requirements for a successful installation of an FSOC system. To ensure an uninterrupted data flow, auto-alignment transmitter and receiver modules are necessary [12, 17, 18]. The data loss due to weak scintillation effects can be recovered using various data coding techniques developed for wire- and fiber-based communication systems [13, 14]. In contest, <b>beam</b> <b>wandering</b> and deep signal fading (wavefront distortions) represent unique and significantly more challenging problems, which cannot be resolved using conventional data coding techniques, and a major incentive for the incorporation of adaptive optics technology (<b>beam</b> <b>wandering</b> mitigation and wavefront corrections) into the FSOC architecture is an active prevention of long-term data loss [12, 15, 16]. The first and most important requirement for the successful installation of FSOC is beam steering (reduction of focal spot wander) that mitigates the <b>beam</b> <b>wandering</b> (temporal distortions) [1, 16 – 18] which is the research component and main contribution in this work.|$|R

The OSF consists of a pinhole and cone reflector. The pinhole produces Fresnel diffraction on the focus spot. The cone reflector provides directed reflectance onto the pinhole for random focus spot displacements due to <b>beam</b> <b>wander.</b> The calculations of signal power are based on fluctuations of signal intensity that are minimized by the circular aperture function of the pinhole and the cosine of the reflectance angle from the cone reflector.

The <b>beam</b> <b>wandering</b> mitigation experiment using the developed neural controller is conducted in different local weather conditions (monsoon, rainy, winter, pre-summer, and summer) {{in a period of}} 1  year. A highly accurate weather station is built [6] and used to continuously measure the local weather changes in diurnal periods. The measurements corresponding to the weather changes are stored in the data-logging computer. The results presented below are corresponding to the winter session (15 December 2013 - Sunday). In this season, the weather parameter variations from 1.5 to 5.1  ms− 1 with the standard deviation (Std) of 0.97  ms− 1 for wind speed (Ws), 23 °C to 31 °C with the Std of 2.65 °C for temperature (T), 52 % to 94 % with the Std of 13 % for relative humidity (RH), and 1 to 4  km with the Std of 0.87  km for visibility (V) are observed. The Std of T and RH are high while those of Ws and V are low. The different conditions of the atmosphere observed on 15 December 2013 (Sunday) are hazy, with scattered clouds, misty, foggy, and partially cloudy. The disturbances are introduced in the beam propagation angle for the frequency range of 0 to 2  kHz at the transmitter in addition to the turbulent channel effects to validate the maximum capability of the developed closed-loop neural-control system. The performances of the developed neural controller are intensively investigated in a closed-loop control configuration.

40|$|We numerically {{examine the}} spatial {{evolution}} {{of the structure of}} coherent and partially coherent laser beams, including the optical vortices, propagating in turbulent atmospheres. The influence of <b>beam</b> fragmentation and <b>wandering</b> relative to the axis of propagation (z-axis) on the value of the scintillation index (SI) of the signal at the detector is analyzed. These studies were performed for different dimensions of the detector, distances of propagation, and strengths of the atmospheric turbulence. Methods for significantly reducing the scintillation index are described. These methods utilize averaging of the signal at the detector over a set of partially coherent beams (PCBs). It is demonstrated that the most effective approach is using a set of PCBs with definite initial directions of propagation relative to the z-axis. This approach results in a significant compensation of the <b>beam</b> <b>wandering</b> which in many cases is the main contributor to the SI. A novel method is to generate the PCBs by combining two laser beams - Gaussian and vortex beams, with different frequencies (the difference between these two frequencies being significantly smaller than the frequencies themselves). In this case, the effective suppression of the SI does not require high-frequency modulators. This result is important for achieving gigabit data-rates in long-distance laser communication through turbulent atmospheres. Comment: 35 pages, 29 figure...|$|R
40|$|The hot {{exhaust gases}} from engines on {{helicopters}} are pushed {{down by the}} rotor in a turbulent flow. When the optical path of a laser beam or optical sensor passes through this region severe aberrations of the optical field may result. These perturbations will lead to <b>beam</b> <b>wander</b> and beam distortions that can limit the performance of optical countermeasure systems. To quantify these effects the Italian Air Force Flight Test Centre hosted a trial for the "Airborne platform effects on lasers and warning sensors" (ALWS) EDA-project. Laser beams were propagated from the airport control tower to a target screen in a slant path with the helicopter hovering over this path. Collimated laser beams at 1. 55 -, 2 -and 4. 6 -mu m wavelength were imaged with high speed cameras. Large increases in <b>beam</b> <b>wander</b> and beam divergence were found, with <b>beam</b> <b>wander</b> up to 200 mu rad root-mean-square and increases in beam divergence up to 1 mrad. To allow scaling to other laser beam parameters and geometries formulas for propagation in atmospheric turbulence were used even though the turbulence may not follow Kolmogorov statistics. By assuming that the plume is short compared to the total propagation distance the integrated structure parameter through the plume could be calculated. Values in the range 10 (- 10) to 10 (- 8) m(1 / 3) were found when the laser beams passed through the exhaust gases below the helicopter tail. The integrated structure parameter values calculated from <b>beam</b> <b>wander</b> were consistently lower than those calculated from long term spot size, indicating that the method is not perfect but provides information about order of magnitudes.

Fading, i. e. transmission fluctuations, caused by <b>beam</b> <b>wandering</b> due to atmospheric turbulence, is a frequent challenge in free-space communication.

On the one hand, the detection process may benefit from scintillation of signals from point-like targets at long range, while target identification is hampered by turbulence induced blurring and <b>beam</b> <b>wander.</b> According to the commonly used turbulence model, based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory for the marine boundary layer (the so-called bulk model), the structure function for refractive index Cn 2 decreases with altitude.

30|$|Considering the {{interaction}} of the various sub-systems in determining pointing performance is a significant systems engineering challenge spanning all parties and disciplines. There are several potential sources of pointing error either leading to low frequency biases or high frequency noise in the transmitted beam direction. Low frequency drift will misalign the telescope bore axis from the OGS direction and if left unchecked could bring the deviation outside of the angular limits of the BSM. As long as the coarse pointing system can keep the optical boresight to within these limits, the final pointing performance will be determined mainly by the fine pointing mechanism. This will be mainly impacted by high frequency noise leading to jitter or <b>beam</b> <b>wandering.</b> A high optical OBT detection bandwidth is essential for rejecting this source of noise. Noise with higher frequency components than the OBT frame rate can be tackled by the IMUs and blended rate sensor fusion to compensate for any motion occurring in-between frames of the OBT [69, 70]. Quantum communication experiments have achieved a few μrad accuracy under demanding conditions such as in a propeller driven airplane [3] or lofted on a hot air balloon [8]. The more benign microgravity environment and lower vibrational background of a space-based experiment should allow at least as good performance and we consider residual effects that may affect pointing performance.|$|R

Its principle is based on the illumination of a scene with a pulsed laser which is then backscattered to the sensor. The signal to noise ratio and contrast of the object over the background are increased in comparison with passive imaging. Even though, range and field of view (FOV) are limited for a given laser power. A new active imaging system presented here aims at overcoming this limitation. It acquires the entire scene with a high-speed scanning laser illumination focused on a limited region, whereas at each scan the full frame active image is acquired. The whole image is then reconstructed by mosaicking all these successive images. A first evaluation of the performance of this system is conducted by using a direct physical model. This end-to-end model, realistic in terms of turbulence effects (scintillation, <b>beam</b> <b>wandering</b> [...] .), gives us a sequence of images a synthetic scenes. After presenting this model, a reconstruction method of the total scene is described. And the performances of this new concept are compared to those of a conventional flash active camera by using usual metrics (SNR, MTF [...] .). For various mean laser powers, we quantify the gains expected in terms of range and field of view of this new concept...|$|R

The advantages of employing SCMs for focusing the light onto a small area photodetector are improved efficiency in collecting income scattered light beam in a turbulence channel and the detachment between {{the position of the}} SCM focal point and fluctuations of the refractive index of the channel. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated in an indoor controlled turbulence environment over a propagation span of up to 104 m. The results testify that SCM can effectively compensate the optical spot scattering and wandering effect, thus leading to improved performance of the FSO system...|$|R
