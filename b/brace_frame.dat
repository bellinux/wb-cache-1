5000|$|Hybrid masonry is a {{new type}} of {{building}} system that uses engineered, reinforced masonry to <b>brace</b> <b>frame</b> structures. Typically, hybrid masonry is implemented with concrete masonry panels used to brace steel frame structures. The basic concept is to attach a reinforced concrete masonry panel to a structural steel frame such that some combination of gravity forces, story shears and overturning moments can be transferred to the masonry. The structural engineer can choose from three different types of hybrid masonry (I, II, or III) and two different reinforcement anchorage types (a & b). In conventional steel frame building systems, the vertical force resisting steel frame system is supported in the lateral direction by steel bracing or an equivalent system. When the architectural plans call for concrete masonry walls to be placed within the frame, extra labor is required to ensure the masonry fits around the steel frame. Usually, this placement does not take advantage of the structural properties of the masonry panels. In hybrid masonry, the masonry panels take the place of conventional steel bracing, utilizing the structural properties of reinforced concrete masonry walls.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 28) The concentric <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> of {{an existing}} 4 -story steel building was redesigned as an eccentric <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> {{for the purpose of}} comparing the structural, architectural, and economic characteristics of the two systems. The concentric <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> is an efficient structural system for resisting moderate lateral loads, but does not have the ductility required to withstand severe lateral loads. The eccentric <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> can sustain the full range of possible lateral loading because it is both a stiff and a ductile system. This dual behavior is achieved by a link-beam which can dissipate large amounts of energy through cyclic yielding, while preventing the stiff brace elements form buckling. The structural research on the eccentric <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> has been quite extensive in recent years; and design criteria is now available. This paper presents a general theoretical comparison of lateral force resisting systems, examines the behavior and design of the eccentric <b>braced</b> <b>frame,</b> and concludes with the design comparison of the two bracing systems for a particular building...|$|R
50|$|A buckling-restrained brace (BRB) is a {{structural}} brace in a building, {{designed to allow}} the building to withstand cyclical lateral loadings, typically earthquake-induced loading.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{challenge for}} the structural engineer in designing earthquake-resistant structures is to design buildings with both adequate ductility and sufficient stiffness. Traditional lateral force resisting systems such as the moment resisting frame and the concentrically braced frame are both conventional structural schemes that have been implemented for many years, but result in only mediocre performance levels. The lacking stiffness of a moment resisting frame {{as well as the}} limited ductility of a concentrically braced frame gave impetus for engineers to direct significant research efforts into the development of new lateral resisting systems that embody a more stable hysteretic behavior, adequate ductility, control of damage, and energy dissipating capacity. Fortunately, several recent developments have allowed engineers to move one step closer to designing more efficient earthquake-resistant structures. "High-performance braces," as this thesis calls them, are new and improved bracing systems that combine the economy and stiffness of a concentrically braced frame with the ductility and energy dissipating capacity of a moment resisting frame. This thesis analyzes and evaluates three different types of high-performance braces: (i) the buckling-restrained <b>brace</b> <b>frame,</b> (ii) the self-centering energy dissipating <b>brace</b> <b>frame,</b> and (iii) the hybrid <b>brace</b> <b>frame,</b> with regards to their structural performance and economy. The primary goal of the thesis is to provide useful insights into the current developments of high-performance braces for practicing engineers in the hope that such systems can be more widely adopted and utilized in the contemporary design of earthquake-resistant structures.

Along with gravity load structure has to withstand the lateral load which can develop high stresses. Now a day, shear wall in R. C. structure and steel bracings in steel structure are most popular system to resist lateral load due to earthquake, wind, blast etc. The bracing {{is one of the}} best lateral load resisting systems and it will be the viable solution for enhancing earthquake resistance. A Bracing is a system that is provided to minimize the lateral deflection of structure. The members of a braced frame are subjected to tension and compression, so that they are provided to take these forces similar to a truss. Braced frames are always designed of steel members. Use of the braced frames has become very popular in high rise structure and also in seismic design of them. So there is a need of precise and exact modeling and analysis using software ETABS to interpret relation between <b>brace</b> <b>frame</b> and without <b>brace</b> <b>frame</b> aspects. The present study assesses the seismic response of steel structure with concentric bracing system. Two structural configurations were utilized; vertical irregular model (VIRM), vertical irregular model with mega bracing (VIRM_MB).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} summarizes both {{experimental and}} analytical {{studies on the}} seismic response of conventional steel concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> systems of the type widely used in North America, and preliminary studies of an innovative hybrid <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> system: the Strong-Back System. The research work is part of NEES small group project entitled "International Hybrid Simulation of Tomorrow's <b>Braced</b> <b>Frames.</b> " In the experimental phase, {{a total of four}} full-scale, one-bay, two-story conventional <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> specimens with different bracing member section shapes and gusset plate-to-beam connection details were designed and tested at the NEES@Berkeley Laboratory. Three <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> specimens were tested quasi-statically using the same predefined loading protocol to investigate the inelastic cyclic behavior of code-compliant <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> at both the global and local level. The last <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> specimen was nearly identical to one of those tested quasi-statically. However, it was tested using hybrid simulation techniques to examine the sensitivity of inelastic behavior on loading sequence and to relate the behavior observed to different levels of seismic hazard. Computer models of the test specimens were developed using two different computer software programs. In the software framework OpenSees fiber-based line elements were used to simulate global buckling of members and yielding and low-cycle fatigue failure at sections. The LS-DYNA analysis program was also used to model individual struts and the test specimens using shell elements with adaptive meshing and element erosion features. This program provided enhanced ability to simulate section local buckling, strain concentrations and crack development. The numerical results were compared with test results to assess and refine and the ability of the models to predict <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> behavior. A series of OpenSees numerical cyclic component simulations were then conducted using the validated modeling approach. Two hundred and forty pin-ended struts with square hollow structural section shape were simulated under cyclic loading to examine the effect of width-to-thickness ratios and member slenderness ratios on the deformation capacity and energy dissipation characteristics of brace members. The concept of a hybrid system, consisting of a vertical elastic truss or strong-back, and a <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> that responds inelastically, is proposed herein to mitigate the tendency of weak-story mechanisms to form in conventional steel <b>braced</b> <b>frames.</b> A simple design strategy about member sizing of the proposed Strong-Back System is provided in this study. To assess the ability of the new Strong-Back System to perform well under seismic loading, a series of inelastic analyses were performed considering three six-story hybrid <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> having different <b>bracing</b> elements, and three six-story conventional <b>brace</b> <b>frames</b> having different <b>brace</b> configurations. Monotonic and cyclic quasi-static inelastic analyses and inelastic time history analyses were carried out. The <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> system behavior, <b>bracing</b> member force-displacement hysteresis loops, and system residual drifts were the primary response quantities examined. These indicated that the new hybrid system was able to achieve its design goals. Experimental results show for the same loading history that the <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> specimen using round hollow structural sections as brace members has the largest deformation capacity among the three types of bracing elements studied. Beams connected to gusset plates at the column formed plastic hinges adjacent to the gusset plate. The gusset plates tend to amplify the rotation demands at these locations and stress concentrations tended to result in early fractures of the plastic hinges that form. To remedy this problem, pinned connection details used in the last two specimens; these proved to prevent failures at these locations under both quasi-static and pseudo-dynamic tests. Failure modes observed near the column to base plate connections in all of the specimens suggest the need for further study. Both OpenSees and LS-DYNA models developed in this study predict the global <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> behavior with acceptable accuracy. In both models, low-cycle fatigue damage models were needed to achieve an acceptable level of fidelity. Shell element models were able to predict local behavior and the mode of failures with greater but not perfect confidence. OpenSees analysis results show that the proposed hybrid <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> would perform better than conventional <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> and that the story deformations are more uniform.

40|$|In this study, a {{new method}} for {{designing}} a particular braced system by using multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed. This type of braced system, {{which is called}} non-geometric braced system are mostly used in seismic areas and it allows architects to have more openings in the panels. Non-straight diagonal member of this system introduces eccentricity and it {{is connected to the}} corner of the frame by a third member. In designing this system, designers often use trial and error method to locate the connection point of the brace elements by considering various parameters which affect the design such as opening and frame dimensions, cross section areas of brace elements and the location of brace element connection. Hence, finding the best connection point with maximum stiffness and minimum weight of brace elements with conventional methods is not trivial. In this study, a multi-object genetic algorithm is proposed in determining the best selection for connection point and also the brace elements' cross section area proportions which is the key rule in determining the stiffness of the system. Boundary equations are set by introducing feasible area to avoid improper individuals followed by utilization of some operators such as selection, mutation, crossover and elite genetic algorithm. Based on the plain aggregate approaches for transforming the objective vector in scalar, some modifications are proposed to assist designers in making decision on prioritizing between the frame stiffness and <b>brace</b> <b>frame</b> weight in their design...|$|E

Motion amplification devices are designed to amplify a small interstory drift to intensify the stroke of the dampers attached.

This thesis focuses on the seismic performance evaluation of the toggle <b>brace</b> <b>frame</b> configuration employed for seismic upgrade. In order to carry out a performance evaluation of the toggle brace damper, a practical approach to performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) is presented in this study. The approach considers the seismic hazard, structural response, resulting damage, and repair costs associated with restoring the building to its original condition using a fully probabilistic analysis. The procedure is organized to be consistent with conventional building designs, construction, and analysis practices {{so that it can be}} readily incorporated into a design process. A nine-story moment frame located in downtown Los Angeles based on pre-Northridge design code is subjected to PBEE evaluation in this study. The performance of the structural frame is assessed by conducting a non-linear dynamic time history analysis in both cases, with and without the inclusion of the toggle brace damper.

KramerDual Lateral Force Resisting Systems are {{currently}} required by code {{to include a}} Moment Resisting Frame capable of resisting at least 25 % of the lateral loads. This thesis evaluates the seismic performance of {{a specific type of}} dual system: a Special Moment Resisting Frame-Special Concentric <b>Brace</b> <b>Frame</b> System (SMRF-SCBF) under three different force distributions. The three distributions were 80 % - 20 %, 75 % - 25 %, and 70 % - 30 % with the lesser force being allotted to the Special Moment Resisting Frame (SMRF) portion of the system. In order to evaluate the system, a parametric study was performed. The parametric study consisted of three SMRF-SCBF systems designed with different seismic force distributions. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine accuracy of the three different seismic force distributions. The accuracy was measured by comparing individual system models’ data and combined system models’ data. The data used for comparison included joint deflections (both horizontal and vertical), induced moments at moment connections, brace axial loads, column shears, and column base reactions. Two-dimensional models using the structural software RISA 3 D were used to assist in designing the independent Seismic Force Resisting Systems. The designs of the frames were not finely tuned (smallest member size for strength), but were designed for drift (horizontal deflection) requirements and constructability issues. Connection designs were outside the scope of the study, except for constructability considerations – the SMRF and the SCBF did not have a common column; the frames were a bay apart connected with a link beam. The results indicated that a seismic force distribution of 75 % to the SCBF and 25 % to the SMRF most accurately predicts that frame’s behavior. A force distribution of 80 % to the SCBF and 20 % to the SMRF resulted in moderately accurate results as well. A vast opportunity for further research into this area of study exists. Alterations to the design process, consideration of wind loads, or additional force distributions are all recommended changes for further research into this topic...|$|E
40|$|STEEL, the Caltech created {{nonlinear}} large {{displacement analysis}} software, is currently {{used by a}} large number of researchers at Caltech. However, due to its complexity, lack of visualization tools (such as pre- and post-processing capabilities) rapid creation and analysis of models using this software was difficult. SteelConverter was created as a means to facilitate model creation through the use of the industry standard finite element solver ETABS. This software allows users to create models in ETABS and intelligently convert model information such as geometry, loading, releases, fixity, etc., into a format that STEEL understands. Models that would take several days to create and verify now take several hours or less. The productivity of the researcher as well as the level of confidence in the model being analyzed is greatly increased. It has always been a major goal of Caltech to spread the knowledge created here to other universities. However, due to the complexity of STEEL it was difficult for researchers or engineers from other universities to conduct analyses. While SteelConverter did help researchers at Caltech improve their research, sending SteelConverter and its documentation to other universities was less than ideal. Issues of version control, individual computer requirements, and the difficulty of releasing updates made a more centralized solution preferred. This is where the idea for Caltech VirtualShaker was born. Through the creation of a centralized website where users could log in, submit, analyze, and process models in the cloud, all of the major concerns associated with the utilization of SteelConverter were eliminated. Caltech VirtualShaker allows users to create profiles where defaults associated with their most commonly run models are saved, and allows them to submit multiple jobs to an online virtual server to be analyzed and post-processed. The creation of this website not only allowed for more rapid distribution of this tool, but also created a means for engineers and researchers with no access to powerful computer clusters to run computationally intensive analyses without the excessive cost of building and maintaining a computer cluster. In order to increase confidence in the use of STEEL as an analysis system, as well as verify the conversion tools, a series of comparisons were done between STEEL and ETABS. Six models of increasing complexity, ranging from a cantilever column to a twenty-story moment frame, were analyzed to determine the ability of STEEL to accurately calculate basic model properties such as elastic stiffness and damping through a free vibration analysis as well as more complex structural properties such as overall structural capacity through a pushover analysis. These analyses showed a very strong agreement between the two softwares on every aspect of each analysis. However, these analyses also showed the ability of the STEEL analysis algorithm to converge at significantly larger drifts than ETABS when using the more computationally expensive and structurally realistic fiber hinges. Following the ETABS analysis, it was decided to repeat the comparisons in a software more capable of conducting highly nonlinear analysis, called Perform. These analyses again showed a very strong agreement between the two softwares in every aspect of each analysis through instability. However, due to some limitations in Perform, free vibration analyses for the three story one bay chevron <b>brace</b> <b>frame,</b> two bay chevron <b>brace</b> <b>frame,</b> and twenty story moment frame could not be conducted. With the current trend towards ultimate capacity analysis, the ability to use fiber based models allows engineers {{to gain a better understanding}} of a building’s behavior under these extreme load scenarios. Following this, a final study was done on Hall’s U 20 structure [1] where the structure was analyzed in all three softwares and their results compared. The pushover curves from each software were compared and the differences caused by variations in software implementation explained. From this, conclusions can be drawn on the effectiveness of each analysis tool when attempting to analyze structures through the point of geometric instability. The analyses show that while ETABS was capable of accurately determining the elastic stiffness of the model, following the onset of inelastic behavior the analysis tool failed to converge. However, for the small number of time steps the ETABS analysis was converging, its results exactly matched those of STEEL, leading to the conclusion that ETABS is not an appropriate analysis package for analyzing a structure through the point of collapse when using fiber elements throughout the model. The analyses also showed that while Perform was capable of calculating the response of the structure accurately, restrictions in the material model resulted in a pushover curve that did not match that of STEEL exactly, particularly post collapse. However, such problems could be alleviated by choosing a more simplistic material model. ...|$|E

30|$|At present, in {{designing}} seismic resistant steel buildings, {{systems such as}} moment <b>frames,</b> concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> and eccentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> are widely used. Moment resisting frames show a good ductility due to the bending yield of the beam but its stiffness in low. Concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> have a high stiffness but due to the buckling of the compressional brace, it displays a low ductility. To overcome the problem of stiffness in moment resisting frames and also the problem of low ductility in concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames,</b> Hjelmstad and Popov (1983) proposed the eccentric brace. By considering the appropriate amount of eccentricity, the system contains sufficient stiffness and through the shear and bending yield of the intermediary beam, the ductility will be provided. This system has fitting ductility and stiffness but to supply its ductility, the intermediary beam, {{which is one of}} the main elements of the structure, must yield and that results in severe damage to the ceiling which makes the post-earthquake repairing difficult (Balendra and Sam 1991 b, 1994).|$|R

KramerIn 2006, a {{research}} project was being carried out by architects at architecture/engineering firm Cannon Design involving an optimum bay size for a hospital. RISA computer modeling was used to explore a set of lateral force resisting system (LFRS) options for a building based on this optimum bay size and importance category. The structural material was first narrowed down to steel, and then moment <b>frames</b> and <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> are examined. The LFRS was narrowed down to <b>braced</b> <b>frames,</b> discarding moment frames due to their inordinate story drift. Of {{the different types of}} <b>braced</b> <b>frames,</b> the study further narrowed the LFRS system to chevron <b>braced</b> <b>frames.</b> Then the precise arrangement of braces for a particular building size using this bay system was examined. The steel material cost of the final system was compared to a system that only included members sized for gravity loads to demonstrate the rough amount of cost that a lateral system can add to a building...|$|R

In the case that no column flexural stiffness is provided, a soft-story mechanism may occur in a <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> {{as soon as the}} braces in one level reach their strength. Real frames often possess sufficient column flexural stiffness and strength that large concentrations of damage do not generally occur. In a previous paper, the effect of the column flexural stiffness on 2 story <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> with pinned column bases was quantified using direct mathematical formulation, frame push-over analysis and dynamic analysis. It was shown that increased column stiffness and strength tend to reduce the story drift concentration. This paper evaluates the effect of column base fixity, as well as column stiffness and strength, on drift concentration in two story <b>braced</b> <b>frames...</b>|$|R
