25|$|Shankara's stotras {{considered}} authentic {{include those}} dedicated to Krishna (Vaishnavism) {{and one to}} Shiva (Shaivism) – often considered two different sects within Hinduism. Scholars suggest that these stotra are not sectarian, <b>but</b> <b>essentially</b> Advaitic and reach for a unified universal view of Vedanta.|$|E

25|$|The last {{stage of}} satiety {{occurs in the}} liver. The liver is also the first organ to detect that {{nutrients}} are being received from the intestines. When the liver receives nutrients, it then sends {{a signal to the}} brain that produces satiety; <b>but</b> <b>essentially,</b> it is continuing the satiety that was already started by signals that arose from the stomach and upper intestine.|$|E
25|$|The similar <b>but</b> <b>essentially</b> {{unrelated}} arm-reliquary was {{a popular}} form during the medieval period when the hand was most used. Typically these are in precious metal, showing the hand {{and most of the}} forearm, pointing up erect from a flat base where the arm stopped. They contained relics, usually from that part of the body of the saint, and it was the saint's hand that was represented.|$|E
25|$|The Bank of Toronto {{established}} {{itself as}} an efficient, profitable, <b>but</b> <b>essentially</b> conservative bank through the 19th century. It maintained a very high reserve against its capital and enjoyed the highest share price of any bank in Canada. Growth was very slow and deliberate with a few new branches opened in emerging regional centres. Core customers remained farmers, merchants, and processors of farm products (millers, brewers, distillers).|$|E

25|$|The artistic {{inspiration}} from Greek floral scrolls is found quite literally in {{the decoration of}} Japanese roof tiles, {{one of the only}} remaining element of wooden architecture throughout centuries. The clearest ones are from the 7th century Nara temple building tiles, some of them exactly depicting vines and grapes. These motifs have evolved towards more symbolic representations, <b>but</b> <b>essentially</b> remain to this day in many Japanese traditional buildings.|$|E
25|$|In early 197 Severus {{departed}} Rome and travelled to {{the east}} by sea. He embarked at Brundisium and probably landed {{at the port of}} Aegeae in Cilicia, travelling to Syria by land. He immediately gathered his army and crossed the Euphrates. Abgar IX, King of Osroene <b>but</b> <b>essentially</b> only the ruler of Edessa since the annexation of his kingdom as a Roman province, handed over his children as hostages and assisted Severus' expedition by providing archers.|$|E
25|$|The {{system of}} monasticism {{in which the}} {{religious}} become members of an order, with common ties and a common rule, living in a mutually dependent community, {{rather than as a}} group of hermits living in proximity <b>but</b> <b>essentially</b> separate, was established by the monk Benedict in the 6th century. From this time onwards, monasteries were established across Europe, bringing about not only the construction of large churches, but also cloisters, domestic quarters and other buildings associated with community living such as hospitals, barns, and forges.|$|E

Mezentius, who has allowed his son to be killed while he himself fled, reproaches himself and faces Aeneas in single combat—an honourable <b>but</b> <b>essentially</b> futile endeavour. In book 11, another notable, Camilla, a sort of Amazon character, fights bravely but is killed. She has been a virgin devoted to Diana and to her nation; Arruns, the man who kills her, is struck dead by Diana's sentinel, Opis.|$|E
25|$|The {{system of}} monasticism {{in which the}} {{religious}} become members of an order, with common ties and a common rule, living in a mutually dependent community, {{rather than as a}} group of hermits living in proximity <b>but</b> <b>essentially</b> separate, was established by the monk Benedict in the 6th century. The Benedictine monasteries spread from Italy throughout Europe, being always by far the most numerous in England. They were followed by the Cluniac order, the Cistercians, Carthusians and Augustinian Canons. During the Crusades, the military orders of the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights Templar were founded.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, the Holy Roman Emperors built {{a number}} of residences, fortified, <b>but</b> <b>essentially</b> palaces rather than castles, at {{strategic}} points and on trade routes. The Imperial Palace of Goslar (heavily restored in the 19th century) {{was built in the}} early 11th century by Otto III and Henry III, while the ruined Palace at Gelnhausen was received by Frederick Barbarossa prior to 1170. The movement of people and armies also brought about the building of bridges, some of which have survived, including the 12th-century bridge at Besalú, Catalonia, the 11th-century Puente de la Reina, Navarre and the Pont-Saint-Bénézet, Avignon.|$|E

25|$|Formally {{part of the}} Ottoman Empire <b>but</b> <b>essentially</b> {{free from}} Ottoman control, {{starting}} in the 16th century Algiers turned to piracy and ransoming. Due to its location {{on the periphery of}} both the Ottoman and European economic spheres, and depending for its existence on a Mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by European shipping, backed by European navies, piracy became the primary economic activity. Repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western Mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as Iceland. The United States fought two wars (the First and Second Barbary Wars) over Algiers' attacks on shipping.|$|E

When Keith Fletcher deflected a ball on to his cap and crumpled in a heap as it dropped just short of cover point, Ian Chappell probably thought his grandafther would approve if he had been alive to witness the carnage. One can only hope that the reaction of Vic Richardson – a combative, <b>but</b> <b>essentially</b> a cheerful, sporting cricketer – would have surprised Chappell.|$|E
25|$|Southern Senators {{continued}} to hold a hammerlock on Congress. Because of the Southern Democrats' disfranchisement of African Americans in Southern states {{at the start of}} the 20th century, Southern whites for decades had nearly double the representation in Congress beyond their own population. Southern states had Congressional representation based on total population, <b>but</b> <b>essentially</b> only whites could vote and only their issues were supported. Due to seniority achieved through one-party Democratic rule in their region, Southern Democrats controlled many important committees in both houses. Southern Democrats consistently opposed any legislation related to putting lynching under Federal oversight. As a result, Southern white Democrats were a formidable power in Congress until the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|The abbey's estates {{were large}} but very widely distributed. This made them {{expensive}} {{to work and}} manage, with stewards to pay at each grange. There were also underlying problems implicit in the abbey's status as a royal foundation. The problem of corrodies was intractable. These gifts of food and clothing were not alms <b>but</b> <b>essentially</b> pensions that could be purchased and they were regarded as perquisites for royal employees. Any servant of the king who asked would be given or sold a corrody, entitling them to basic maintenance for life, and many abbey servants were also given corrodies, which continued even after they finished working for the abbey. Abbots gave too many away and sold others too cheaply as favours. There was also a king's clerk to maintain unless a benefice could be found. Retired abbots expected an income and good quality accommodation.|$|E
25|$|Littleton was {{returned}} unopposed, along with Sir John Wrottesley, 8th Baronet, as MP for Staffordshire on 8 April 1784. The seat was dominated {{at this time}} by the Leveson-Gower family of Trentham Hall. They were traditionally Whigs but Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford had accepted posts in Tory ministries. By general agreement among the county landed gentry, one candidate should represent the Leveson Gower interest: this was Wrottesley, who {{had served in the}} American Revolutionary War, but returned home to oppose the running of it – essentially Gower's own position. The second seat was for a country member: a gentlemen acceptable to the local landowning interest <b>but</b> <b>essentially</b> uncommitted to party. This was Littleton. In fact, the Earl of Uxbridge had designs on the seat forhis son, Lord Paget, who was still only 16 years old. By proposing Littleton, now in his late 50s, he hoped the seat might become vacant at the next election. In reality, Littleton survived for a further 28 years, holding his seat until his death. Wrottesley, however, died in 1787 and was replaced by Lord Gower, the Marquess's son. Gower was to remain an MP for Staffordshire until 1799, when his half-brother Lord Granville Leveson-Gower took over, holding the seat until 1815. Thus Littleton's colleagues at Westminster were much grander than himself for most of his political career, and in his last years he was largely overawed by them. Because of the tacit agreement about the distribution of seats, all Littleton's elections were uncontested.|$|E
