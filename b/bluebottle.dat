5|$|Sellers's {{introduction}} to film work came in 1950, where he dubbed {{the voice of}} Alfonso Bedoya in The Black Rose. He continued to work with Bentine, Milligan, and Secombe. On 3 February 1951, he made a trial tape entitled The Goons, {{and sent it to}} the BBC producer Pat Dixon, who eventually accepted it. The first Goon Show was broadcast on 28 May 1951. Against their wishes, they appeared under the name Crazy People. Sellers appeared in The Goons until the last programme of the ten-series run, broadcast on 28 January 1960. Sellers played four main characters—Major Bloodnok, Hercules Grytpype-Thynne, <b>Bluebottle</b> and Henry Crun—and seventeen minor ones.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} maggots such as blowfly larvae (gentles) and <b>bluebottle</b> larvae (casters) are bred commercially; they are sold as bait in angling, and as food for {{carnivorous}} animals (kept as pets, in zoos, or for research) such as some mammals, fishes, reptiles, and birds It {{has been suggested}} that fly larvae could be used at a large scale as food for farmed chickens, pigs, and fish. However, consumers are opposed to the inclusion of insects in their food, and the use of insects in animal feed remains illegal in areas such as the European Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{common earwig}} is an omnivore, eating plants and ripe fruit {{as well as}} {{actively}} hunting arthropods. To a large extent, this species is also a scavenger, feeding on decaying plant and animal matter if given the chance. Observed prey include largely plant lice, but also large insects such as <b>bluebottle</b> flies and woolly aphids. Plants that they feed on typically include clover, dahlias, zinnias, butterfly bush, hollyhock, lettuce, cauliflower, strawberry, blackberry, sunflowers, celery, peaches, plums, grapes, potatoes, roses, seedling beans and beets, and tender grass shoots and roots; they have also been known to eat corn silk, damaging the corn.|$|E
50|$|The beach titles, held in glorious {{sunshine}} on Queensland's Gold Coast, {{was dominated}} by New South Wales teams. In the mixed, it was an all New South Wales final with Maroubra <b>Bluebottles</b> beating Harbourside. The women's had Maroubra <b>Bluebottles</b> also winning against defending champions RUOK? from Queensland. The men's saw Victorian side East Melbourne Spartans beat surprise packet Drop Bears from South Australia.|$|R

25|$|Case Study: The {{child of}} an incarcerated father and heroin-addicted, prostitute mother, {{was found on}} July 10, 2000 {{in the home of}} a 20-year-old woman in Germany. Social workers had visited the house at the urging of neighbors, but there was never {{evidence}} found that neglect was occurring. An autopsy showed no signs of previous fractures, illness or drugs, but the child was malnourished. The Muscina stabulans (False Stable Fly) and Fannia canicularis (Little House fly) were recovered from the genital area of the corpse. These particular flies are attracted to urine and/or feces much more than corpses. With the aid of this evidence and the third fly species recovered from the body, Calliphora vomitoria (<b>Bluebottle</b> Fly), the forensic entomologists could not only estimate the time of death, but prove that the child would have lived if proper legal action had been pursued against the negligent caregiver. The mother received a five-year prison sentence and two social workers were charged for duty of care violation.|$|E

500|$|The orchestral {{interlude}} Flight of the Bumblebee {{was composed}} (c. 1900) by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. It represents the turning of Prince Guidon into a bumblebee {{so he can}} fly away to visit his father, Tsar Saltan, in the opera The Tale of Tsar Saltan, although the music may reflect the flight of a <b>bluebottle</b> rather than a bumblebee. The music inspired Walt Disney to feature a bumblebee in his 1940 animated musical Fantasia and have {{it sound as if}} it were flying {{in all parts of the}} theater. This early attempt at [...] "surround sound" [...] was unsuccessful, and the music was excluded from the film's release.|$|E

50|$|Jellyfish stings in Australia {{can cause}} death, with there being several venomous species of {{jellyfish}}, {{such as the}} box jellyfish and Irukandji Jellyfish. Box jellyfish have caused more than 60 deaths in Australia in the past hundred years. Although they are commonly mistaken for jellyfish, <b>bluebottles</b> are actually siphonophores.|$|R
2500|$|Neddie {{eventually}} falls asleep, {{setting the}} stage for <b>Bluebottle</b> to re-emerge from his bloomers and thus begin a conversation with Eccles, usually another high-point in a Goon Show. This section ends with <b>Bluebottle</b> persuading Eccles to help him push Seagoon down a well, which naturally leads to Little Jim's catchphrase [...] "He's fallen in the water!" [...] During the subsequent audience applause, Milligan shouts [...] "Had to get it in, folks! [...] Had to get it in!" ...|$|E

50|$|The adult beetles {{continue}} {{to protect the}} larvae, which take several days to mature. Many competitors make this task difficult, e.g. <b>bluebottles</b> and ants or burying beetles of either another or the same species. The final-stage larvae migrate into the soil and pupate, transforming from small white larvae to fully formed adult beetles.|$|R

2500|$|The VHS, and {{subsequent}} DVD release (which is verbatim the VHS release) lasts 40 minutes. However, the live telecast, {{and subsequent}} LP release were longer. The CD release is {{faithful to the}} LP release, with a total running time of about 52 minutes. In editing the VHS release down to 40 minutes, the lead-up to a delayed punch-line is lost. The punch line comprises <b>Bluebottle</b> asking Moriarty: [...] "...what is that lump on your nut?", to which Moriarty replies: [...] "That {{is the difference between}} margarine". The primer for this punch-line was edited out between announcer Andrew Timothy's follow-on at the end of Ray Ellington's song, and the part where Neddy drives up on an unlicensed Goon Show. Amongst the banter, Grytpype-Thynne tells Moriarty to place his head on an anvil, followed by a clang, and screams of pain from Moriarty. Grytpype then says: [...] "now, taste this margarine". Moriarty complies. Grytpype says: [...] "There. Can you tell the difference?". Moriarty: [...] "No". Grytpype (triumphantly): [...] "You see! You can't tell the difference between a lump on the head and margarine. The leadership of the Conservative Party is yours for the asking!" ...|$|E

50|$|Thirroul is {{an exposed}} beach and reef break, and has {{reliable}} surf all year. The most desirable wind for surfing in Thirroul is offshore winds {{from the west}} north-west. Most of the surf in Thirroul comes from groundswells, with the best swell direction the south-east. The beach break provides for both left and right-handers. Caution should be taken with rips, rocks, sharks and, during the summer, <b>bluebottles.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Calliphoridae (commonly {{known as}} blow flies, blow-flies, carrion flies, <b>bluebottles,</b> greenbottles, or cluster flies) are {{a family of}} insects in the order Diptera, with 1,100 known species.

The family {{is known to be}} polyphyletic, but much remains disputed {{regarding}} proper treatment of the constituent taxa, some of which are occasionally accorded family status (e.g., Bengaliidae, Helicoboscidae, Polleniidae, and Rhiniidae).|$|R

Often gathers in large numbers to feed on dead and stranded jellyfish and <b>bluebottles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As {{with the}} {{original}} series, references to contemporary events are heard in the show, and {{with the passage of}} time the significance of the references has faded. For instance, at one point Neddie declares that he must get <b>Bluebottle's</b> photographs back [...] "before Bryan Forbes turns them into a novelty!" [...] This was a reference to the recently published first novel (The Distant Laughter) by the film director Forbes. The novel had been received with derision in certain quarters, particularly in Private Eye.|$|R
50|$|Lanchester {{made her}} film debut in The Scarlet Woman (1925) and in 1928 {{appeared}} in three 'silent shorts' written for her by H. G. Wells {{and directed by}} Ivor Montagu (<b>Bluebottles,</b> Daydreams and The Tonic) in which Laughton made brief appearances. They also appeared together in a 1930 'film revue' entitled Comets, featuring British stage, musical and variety acts, in which they sang in duet 'The Ballad of Frankie and Johnnie.' Lanchester appeared in several other early British talkies, including Potiphar's Wife (1931), starring Laurence Olivier.|$|R
