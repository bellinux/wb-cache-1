40|$|For most Sub-Saharan African countries, {{agriculture}} {{is a key}} to achieving <b>broad-based</b> (pro-poor) <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> and attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Approximately 70 – 80 % of the continent’s employment and 40 % of its export earnings stem from agricultural activities. A stronger agricultural sector is considered to be fundamental for Africa’s overall <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> as well as for addressing hunger, poverty, and inequality. However, the sector is not performing well for various reasons. Therefore, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) – the economic programme of the African Union (AU) – has set itself the task to revitalise the sector. For this purpose, it has initiated the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) in order to improve agricultural policies in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In addition, the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), another NEPAD initiative, seeks to improve African political, economic and business governance in general. Together, CAADP and APRM should be expected to improve substantially the institutional and political conditions for agriculture. This paper analyses CAADP and APRM policy-making processes in the agricultural sector. The analysis shows that CAADP and APRM have a potential to bring fundamental qualitative changes in the way policies are made in member countries. While the present paper is mainly a desk-based study, it provides a foundation for conducting further research on the topic on the ground. " [Autorenreferat...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of the Pacific Island countries (PICs) {{over the past two}} decades has been characterized by <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> rates that are low on average yet extremely volatile. This has been so despite favorable levels of natural and human resources, high levels of public investment and aid, and reasonably prudent economic management – a phenomenon that has been labeled the “Pacific Paradox”. Questions may be posed therefore as to what accounts for this poor {{performance of}} the PICs, especially when countries elsewhere of the same size and characteristics have registered impressive growth performance during the same period? Although the inherent structural constraints characterizing the PIC economies have a direct impact on the {{performance of the}}se economies, one cannot dismiss the more fundamental constraints imposed by the institutional environment in which these countries operate. The purpose of this study was to critically review the economic performance of the PICs with a view to evaluating the possible explanations for the “Pacific Paradox”. The proposition evaluated is that it is not the lack of capital or good policies that constrains the <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> and development of these island economies, but rather the lack of appropriate institutions and incentives to accumulate and acquire human and physical capital and to make policies effective. Early tests of this proposition across several Pacific island countries indicate that ineffective institutions, leading to contract insecurity, as well as corrupt practices and bureaucratic ineffectiveness account for large reductions in the average rate of growth of national income in these countries. Unless the PICs undertake appropriate institution-building measures with a view to putting in place the conditions necessary for <b>broad-based,</b> sustained <b>economic</b> <b>growth,</b> these island economies will continue to live out the “Pacific Paradox”. ...|$|R

At the Toronto Summit in 2010, the G- 20 launched the SME Finance Challenge, aimed at getting the private sector to offer suggestions for how public finance can best leverage private finance to promote financial inclusion.

40|$|Until {{the food}} price alarm went off, discussions {{on how to}} reduce hunger and {{malnutrition}} in Africa took place {{in an environment of}} declining food prices with estimates indicating that real food prices declined by about 75 % between 1974 and 2005. However, since 2006, real food prices have been on the rise and although prices started to decline after mid- 2008, they largely remained above their long-term trends. This paper provides a contextual overview of how African countries responded to the economic and welfare impacts of the food price crisis of 2006 - 08. The responses to the food crisis have been as varied as the African economies are diverse. In the short and medium terms, the policy options preferred by both governments and their development partners focused predominantly on social safety nets aimed at cushioning vulnerable communities and urban consumers from food inflation. The paper provides a critique of these responses and lays out broad outlines for what must be done in order for African agricultural sectors to be provided with the right investments and incentives to produce sufficient food and lay the basis for <b>broad-based</b> and sustainable <b>economic</b> <b>growth.</b> Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
