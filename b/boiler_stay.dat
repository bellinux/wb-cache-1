50|$|A <b>boiler</b> <b>stay</b> is an {{internal}} structural element used inside boilers. Where {{the shell of}} a boiler or other pressure vessel is made of cylindrical or (part) spherical elements, the internal pressure will be contained without distortion. However, flat surfaces of any significant size will distort under pressure, tending to bulge. Stays of various types are used to support these surfaces by tying them together to resist pressure. Some boiler configurations require {{a great deal of}} staying. A large locomotive boiler may require several thousand stays to support the firebox. In water tube boilers, stays were sometimes used between their main chambers, and could themselves be water tubes.|$|E

50|$|On {{return to}} Didcot, {{it was found}} that a number of copper firebox and <b>boiler</b> <b>stays</b> had broken, {{resulting}} in the need for a large amount of remedial work to the boiler. On 6 September 2012 the locomotive was moved to Loughborough on the Great Central Railway for firebox repairs, which were completed during early 2013. The locomotive then made a series of appearances on the Great Central Railway, for both testing and running-in purposes, but has since returned to Didcot where it is now being prepared to operate on the main line. In 2014, the GWS was given derogation by network rail to use a portable GSMR radio unit on 6023, Saving money and enabling the unit to be used on the GWS's locomotives yet to work on the mainline such as 2999 and 4079.|$|R
50|$|On May 29, 1914, Stadt Rapperswil {{started her}} maiden voyage, housing members of cantonal and {{municipal}} authorities, representatives of Lake Zürich shore communities, and Escher, Wyss & Cie. and further prominent guests on board.. The {{acquisition of the}} new vessel was supported by subsidies of the Swiss government. The ship's salon was built in Art Nouveau style. The Zürcher Dampfbootgesellschaft (ZDG) then owned - together with Helvetia (built in 1875) and Stadt Zürich - three big ships as backbone of its fleet. During World War I, ship operations were reduced, and on December 2, 1918, operations even with steamships were stopped by the Swiss Bundesrat (Swiss Federal Council) as Switzerland couldn't import coal. The schedule restrictions were loosened in 1919. Beginning World War II, the <b>boiler</b> <b>stayed</b> filled with water, and in Winter the plant room was heated to keep the temperature above the freezing point (operationally for military purposes for 24 hours).|$|R
50|$|Coal also {{contains}} traces of toxic heavy {{elements such as}} mercury, arsenic and others. Mercury vaporized in a power plant's <b>boiler</b> may <b>stay</b> suspended in the atmosphere and circulate around the world. While a substantial inventory of mercury exists in the environment, as other man-made emissions of mercury become better controlled, power plant emissions become a significant fraction of the remaining emissions. Power plant emissions of mercury in the United States {{are thought to be}} about 50 tons per year in 2003, and several hundred tons per year in China. Power plant designers can fit equipment to power stations to reduce emissions.|$|R
5000|$|The early boiler fireboxes had flat {{parallel}} sides (see figure 1). As locomotives grew {{in power}} their boilers expanded in diameter, but {{the width of}} the firebox grate was still constrained by the need to fit between the locomotive frames, which were themselves constrained by the gauge between the wheels. This {{led to the development of}} the [...] "waisted" [...] form (see figure 2), where a narrow firebox flared upwards and outwards to meet the <b>boiler</b> barrel. <b>Staying</b> of these firebox side walls could still use simple short rod stays, although these were progressively tilted in the middle of the firebox, so as to remain perpendicular to the sheets.|$|R
50|$|Fireboxes were {{generally}} made of copper, though later locomotives had steel fireboxes. They {{were held to}} the outer part of the <b>boiler</b> by <b>stays</b> (numerous small supports). Parts of the firebox in contact with full steam pressure have to be kept covered with water, to stop them overheating and weakening. The usual cause of firebox collapses is that the boiler water level falls too low {{and the top of}} the firebox (crown sheet) becomes uncovered and overheats. This occurs if the fireman has failed to maintain water level or the level indicator (gauge glass) is faulty. A less common reason is breakage of large numbers of stays, due to corrosion or unsuitable material.|$|R
50|$|The {{expiration}} of the locomotive's 10 year boiler certificate prompted another rebuild. The {{work this}} time was less serious, being mostly wear items such as <b>boiler</b> tubes, firebox <b>stays</b> and worn tyres. The work was completed successfully and 4806 returned to steam on 29 August 2007 and was back in service on 14 September. The new livery was again BR period, but this time in unlined gloss black.|$|R
50|$|Cornish boilers {{had several}} {{advantages}} over the preceding wagon boilers: they were composed of mostly curved surfaces, better {{to resist the}} pressure. Their flat ends were smaller than the flat sides of the wagon <b>boiler</b> and were <b>stayed</b> by the central furnace flue, and sometimes by additional long rod stays. A less obvious advantage was that of boiler scale. Wagon or haystack boilers were heated from beneath and any scale or impurities that formed a sediment settled upon this plate, insulating it from the water. This reduced heating efficiency and could in extremis lead to local overheating and failure of the boiler plates. In the flued boiler, any sediment fell past the furnace flue and settled out {{at the bottom of}} the boiler shell, where it had less effect.|$|R
