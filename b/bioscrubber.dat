Intensive {{livestock}} production {{is connected with}} a number of environmental effects, including emissions of ammonia (NH 3), greenhouse gases (CH 4 and N 2 O), odour, and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2. 5). Possible strategies for emission reduction from animal houses include feed management, adaptation of housing design, and the application of end-of-pipe air treatment, viz acid scrubbers and <b>bioscrubbers.</b> In order to comply with current and future regulations the implementation of air scrubbers is expected to expand in intensive {{livestock production}} areas across Europe. The aim of this thesis is to better understand and improve the performance of air scrubber systems in livestock operations. The objectives are to determine (1) how air scrubbers are performing at livestock farms with regard to ammonia and odour removal; (2) how the cost-efficiency of air scrubbers can be increased by applying a different treatment strategy; (3) if methane can be removed by biological air treatment systems; and (4) to discuss the drawbacks of current air scrubbing practices and make recommendations for improvement. It was found that ammonia removal efficiency by scrubbers is relatively high (on average 96 % for acid scrubbers and 70 % for <b>bioscrubbers),</b> that odour removal is relatively low (on average 31 % for acid scrubbers and 44 % for <b>bioscrubbers),</b> and that especially <b>bioscrubbers</b> often show a large variation in odour removal efficiency. Furthermore, it was found that <b>bioscrubbers</b> often experience operational problems. Next a partial air cleaning approach has been presented in which air is bypassed at occasionally occurring high air flow rates. Model calculations show that a reduction of scrubber volume by 50 % still enables treatment of 80 - 90 % of the ammonia load. This strategy reduces investment and operational costs but hardly affects average ammonia emission levels. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that biological oxidation of methane is possible, although the low water solubility of methane limits the practical application of biofilters or <b>bioscrubbers</b> for methane removal. Finally, it is concluded that scrubbers applied at animal houses can still be improved and optimized. For example the process control and performance of <b>bioscrubbers</b> might be enhanced by measurement of electrical conductivity (EC) as a control parameter for water discharge...|$|R

40|$|Abstract] In this study, a novel <b>bioscrubber</b> was {{developed}} for the complete treatment of NOx from flue gases. As a first step, an autotrophic ANNAMOX system {{was developed}} using ammonia as the electron donor and nitrate as electron acceptor generating nitrogen gas as the reaction product. Once an efficient ANNAMOX culture was developed, nitrate was replaced by NOx. Initially synthetic flue gas with a composition of 80 % N 2, 19 % CO 2 and 100 ppmv was fed to the <b>bioscrubber</b> with an EBRT of 60 sec. The system showed a NOx removal of 20 - 25 %. The synthetic flue gas with 3 - 5 % oxygen also showed the same NOx removal efficiency. In the latter case, more ammonia consumption in the system was noted. However, there was no nitrate accumulation in the system in both the cases. Inorder to improve the NOX removal efficiency, NO in the flue gas was partially oxidized to NO 2 {{with the help of}} ozone (one mole of ozone per mole of NO with an EBRT of 10 sec) and fed to the <b>bioscrubber.</b> The NOx removal efficiency in the system was improved to 75 - 80 %. The <b>bioscrubber</b> was able to remove more than 90 % of the generated NO 3 -. Performance of the reactor is being monitored at different EBRTs.

40|$|Development of an acclimatized SOB biofilm, startup and {{performance}} of a fixed bed <b>bioscrubber</b> packed with corrugated tube parts as a media having high specific surface area was investigated. <b>Bioscrubber</b> was a cylindrical Plexiglas air-and water-tight column with 10 L in working bed volume.

Enriched acclimatized SOB were applied as inoculum for biofilm development, which was carried out by recirculating the prepared microbial suspension through the bed. Thickness of the developed biofilm was 56 μm in which active acidophilic autotrophic H 2 S oxidizing bacteria were completely predominated. Activity measurements showed highest biodegradation rate of biofilm at liquid pH around 3. Due to employing an efficient specialized biofilm, startup period of the reactor was quite short and H 2 S removal efficiency just 12 h after starting up reached above of 92 % and increased to 96 % at day 3 of starting up while inlet H 2 S concentration gradually was increased to around 30 ppm. At the end of start up pH of the recycle liquid was modified to the optimal value of 3 ± 0. 5 in which biofilm demonstrated the highest activity in terms of OUR after which removal efficiency increased around 3 % while other operating conditions were consistent. Furthermore, performance of the <b>bioscrubber</b> was evaluated at various inlet H 2 S concentrations ranging from 30 to 150 ppm v. It was indicated that the inlet H 2 S concentrations in studied range did not affect the performance of the <b>bioscrubber</b> so that the removal efficiency of H 2 S was greater than 99. 4 % at all concentrations. These observations suggested that the development of an efficient specialized SOB biofilm on a media with high specific surface area will decrease the startup course and achieve high removal efficiency in the <b>bioscrubber</b> treating H 2 S. In addition, operation in acidic recycle liquid will overcome use of alkaline to adjust the pH, which reduce the operation cost of the control system. </p...|$|E

Rhizobiales sp. strain F 11 and Xanthobacter autotrophicus sp. GJ 10, exhibiting specific degradation capabilities for fluorobenzene (FB) and 1, 2 -dichloroethane (DCE), respectively, were used as a compound-strain model system. The stability of a combined oil–absorber–bioscrubber (OAB) was compared to the stability of a <b>bioscrubber</b> only (BO) system, during sequentially alternating periods (duration 3 – 6 d) of FB and DCE in the gas feed. The OAB achieved > 66 % degradation of FB, while in the BO system the FB removal efficiency dropped to 0 % upon restoring FB feed after a 3 d FB starvation period. Following 6 d of FB starvation the BO failed to recover within 10 d, while the OAB required only 2 d to recover. In contrast, during the DCE treatment periods the OAB system did not show any advantage over the BO system. Further investigation showed that the F− (a main metabolic product from FB degradation) has a strong inhibitory effect on strain GJ 10 even at concentrations below 50 mg L− 1. In the OAB system the inhibitory effect persisted for longer periods due to the absorber, which continued to supply FB to the system, and caused deterioration in the DCE removal efficiency. The inhibition of the microbial culture was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), which showed that the activity of cells was reduced when only FB was fed. The {{results of this study}} have shown that in the presence of an inhibitory metabolic product the OAB system may not effectively improve the biological treatment of waste gas during sequential alternations in the feed of inhibitory pollutants...|$|E

The second purpose was to simplify the electronic tongue by decreasing the number of electrodes from 14, which was the number of electrodes in the prototype. Different electrodes were used for identification and quantification of different key odorants. A total of eight electrodes were sufficient for identification and quantification in micromolar concentrations of the key odorants n-butyrate, ammonium and phenolate in test mixtures also containing iso-valerate, skatole and p-cresolate.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel <b>bioscrubber</b> concept for biological flue gas desulfurization, {{based on the}} recycling of a cell suspension of sulfite/sulfate reducing bacteria between a scrubber and a sulfite/sulfate reducing hydrogen fed bioreactor. Hydrogen metabolism in sulfite/sulfate reducing cell suspensions was investigated using batch activity tests and by operating a completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The maximum specific hydrogenotrophic sulfite/sulfate reduction rate increased with 10 % and 300 %, respectively, by crushing granular inoculum sludge and by cultivation of this sludge as cell suspension in a CSTR. Operation of a sulfite fed CSTR (hydraulic retention time 4 days; pH 7. 0; sulfite loading rate 0. 5 - 1. 5 g SO 3 (2 -) l(- 1) d(- 1)) with hydrogen as electron donor showed that high (up to 1. 6 g l(- 1)) H 2 S concentrations can be obtained within 10 days of operation. H 2 S inhibition, however, limited the sulfite reducing capacity of the CSTR. Methane production by the cell suspension disappeared within 20 days reactor operation.

The polymer TPPB system demonstrated substantially higher performance than an aqueous phase <b>bioscrubber</b> and comparable performance to a solvent-aqueous TPPB. Also of great interest was the increase in oxygen transfer provided to the system by the addition of polymer beads, which have significant affinity for oxygen.

40|$|International audienceA {{methodology}} {{to determine}} the diameter of an absorber contacting a gas phase and two immiscible liquid phases (water/silicone oil mixture) is presented. The methodology is applied to a countercurrent gas/liquid randomly packed column for the absorption of three VOCs (toluene, dimethyl sulfide, or dimethyl disulfide). Whatever the silicone oil volume fraction, Eckert's generalized pressure drop correlation was used. The results present {{the change in the}} column diameter through the change in the dimensionless ratio D(ϕ) /D(ϕ= 1) versus the silicone oil volume fraction for the same operating conditions. For toluene and dimethyl disulfide, characterized by Hvoc,silicone oil values equal to 2. 3 and 3. 4 Pa m 3 mol− 1, respectively, it is highlighted that it is unwise to use water/silicone oil mixtures for mass transfer. In these cases, the contact between the polluted air and pure silicone oil requires roughly the same amount of silicone oil as for a (90 / 10 v/v) water/silicone oil mixture, but enables a 2 -fold decrease in the column diameter. For dimethyl sulfide, which is characterized by a larger partition coefficient value (Hvoc,silicone oil= 17. 7 Pa m 3 mol− 1), the mass transfer operation should not be considered because large amounts of silicone oil are required (whatever the silicone oil volume fraction), which is not acceptable from an economic point of view. The feasibility of using a <b>bioscrubber</b> for the treatment of hydrophobic pollutants depends mainly on the partition coefficient Hvoc,silicone oil. VOC absorption in TPPB should therefore be restricted to pollutants characterized by a Hvoc,silicone oil value of around 3 to 4 Pa m 3 mol− 1 or less.

The aim was to get better and more secure data for their dimensioning and application. It was investigated whether an activated carbon filter as additional back-end device is a potential completement to biological exhaust air purification processes. The experiments were carried out using exhaust air from composting {{as well as individual}} substances (bench scale), which were identified as typical components of compost odours (ethyl acetate, butanol, toluene, dimethyl disulfide, isovaleric acid, limonene). The purification performance for individual substances was measured by means of a flame ionisation detector (FID), the odour concentrations were determined with an olfactometer. In connection with the experiments into the odour elimination performance the moisture balance of biofilters was comprehensively investigated. Two open single-level filters were tested concerning their method of operation and efficiency. In addition the applicability of an electronic olfactometer with semiconductor gas sensors for odour measuring was examined. Odour elimination in both bioscrubbers and biofilters depends to a large extent on the concentration range in the exhaust air; it can be described for high or low concentrations by a linear function each (first order reaction) with varying coefficients (kinetic constants k_ 1). The serial arrangement of <b>bioscrubber</b> and biofilter as well as the enclosed type of construction proved to be very useful since the advantages of the units are combined and their disadvantages can be modified. The greater technical expenditure and the higher costs involved compared to open single-level filters, which are often applied in composting plants, are justified, in particular for sensitive locations, e. g. in close proximity to residential areas.

Three scrubber configurations (cross-flow and vertical-flow packings and spray tower) were tested, and cross-flow packing was found to be the best one. For this packing, daily average values of VOC removal efficiency ranged between 83 % and 93 % for liquid to air volume ratios between 3. 5 · 10 − 3 and 9. 1 · 10 − 3. Biomass growth was prevented by periodical chemical cleaning; the average pressure drop was 165 Pa m− 1. Rapid initiation of anaerobic degradation was achieved by using granular sludge from a brewery wastewater treatment plant. Despite the intermittent and fluctuating organic load, the expanded granular sludge bed reactor showed an excellent level of performance, reaching removal efficiencies of 93 ± 5 % at 25. 1 ± 3. 2 °C, with biogas methane content of 94 ± 3 % in volume. Volatile fatty acid concentration was as low as 200 mg acetic acid L− 1 by treating daily average organic loads up to 3. 0 kg COD h− 1, equivalent to 24 kg COD m− 3 bed d− 1. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) results revealed the initial shift of the domains Archaea and Bacteria associated with the limitation of the carbon source to a few organic solvents. The Archaea domain was more sensitive, resulting in a drop of the Shannon index from 1. 07 to 0. 41 in the first 123 days. Among Archaea, the predominance of Methanosaeta persisted throughout the experimental period. The increase in the proportion of Methanospirillum and Methanobacterium sp. was linked to the spontaneous variations of operating temperature and load, respectively. Among Bacteria, high levels of ethanol degraders (Geobacter and Pelobacter sp.) were observed during the trial...|$|E
40|$|Modelling {{concepts}} for biofilters and <b>bioscrubbers</b> {{are introduced}} which concern {{the influence of}} the gasphase, the fluidphase and the biofilm containing the microorganisms. The verification of the models is done with a testsystem, i. e. a synthetic waste air containing ethanol. The microoganisms used are Saccaromyces cerevisiae. For this system {{the influence of the}} hydrodynamics and the concentration of the waste on the reactor performance is shown. For the description of the biokinetics of the ethanol removal in the case of nitrogen limitation, i. e. growth limitation a kinetic model is used which takes into account both the concentration of oxygen and ethanol. Experimental results show these influences. Calculations done with the introduced models demonstrate the influence of the solubility of the waste substance, the mass transfer and the hydrodynamics on the conversion factor and the volume of the biofilter/bioscrubber apparatus...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{waste air}} {{purification}} in its {{specific areas of}} application is a reasonable alternative technique compared to physico-chemical processes. Many types of exhaust emissions, also in food industry may be minimised using this technique. Applicability and efficiency have already been proved {{in the case of}} various and very complex emissions of harmful substances. Following a summarising review on the various techniques of waste air purification and the main process types of biofilters and <b>bioscrubbers</b> are described as possibilities of technical application for a biological elimination of emissions. The great potential of microbial metabolism is pointed out as well as an allround evaluation of the biological-oxidative degradation of harmful substances and its connection with the growth of the used microorganisms is carried out. The application of defined cultures offers advantages and supports efforts in developing respective starting cultures...|$|R
40|$|Profit and {{protection}} are two fundamental reasons {{to clean up}} waste gas streams. According {{to the nature of}} the contaminants and/or the complex mixture of pollutants in the gaseous phase, their concentrations and the flow to be cleaned, removing non-particulate pollutants from a gas stream is achieved by different processes classified into three categories: (i) thermal and/or catalytic oxidation, biological transformation; (ii) transfer into a liquid phase (absorption) or onto a solid phase (adsorption); and (iii) phase change (condensation). Bioprocesses, a relatively recent technology, appear to be a competitive way to treat the waste gas stream before its discharge to the atmosphere. The optimal range of pollutant concentration goes from a very diluted pollutant present in the gas stream (from some μg to mg m− 3) to above 1 g m− 3. The installation designs cater for an air flow from a few m 3 h− 1 to more than 100 000 m 3 h− 1. This chapter describes general approaches for bioreactors used in waste gas stream treatment and more specifically the different biosystems such as biofilters, biological trickling beds and <b>bioscrubbers.</b> The general presentation, operating conditions, yields and industrial applications of these bioprocesses are discussed...|$|R
