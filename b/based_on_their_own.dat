5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} factors, the revolt was often considered to either be a {{manipulation of the}} commoners by a reactionary elite against modernization, a successful Ottoman bid to hamper Egypt's efforts to liberate and unify its Arab lands, or was sidelined. The concept that the revolt's diverse participants were acting <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> interests and actual grievances rather than manipulation was largely ignored in Palestinian historiography until recent decades.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} patient and family, palliative care serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube, non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> values.|$|E

5|$|Quinceañera {{was written}} and {{directed}} by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, filmmaking partners and a romantic couple. They conceived the idea for the film in January 2005, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> experiences as a white gay couple moving into the predominantly Latino working-class neighborhood of Echo Park, Los Angeles, as the area underwent gentrification. They were inspired to make a film about the traditional quinceañera celebration after being invited to their fifteen-year-old neighbor's ceremony. With producer Anne Clements, they pitched the idea to three investors—immigrants to the United States from Greece and Israel—who agreed to provide $300,000 to finance the project. (The budget was later raised to $400,000.) Glatzer and Westmoreland then wrote the screenplay over three weeks in February.|$|E

Eleven submarines of the 8th Submarine Squadron were to carry out the two attacks, the five submarines of the Western Attack Group in the Indian Ocean, and the six submarines of the Eastern Attack Group in the Pacific Ocean.

5|$|Trans Polar made a {{demonstration}} trip to Stockholm on 13 June 1970—legal {{because it was}} without paying customers. The airline applied for permission to operate out of Sweden, but this {{was rejected by the}} Swedish Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) and appeals were rejected by the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications. The reason was that it lacked a permanent organization, did not have sufficient experience in large-scale charter operations and could not document that its charter operations would be <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> resources. Despite the lack of permission, Trans Polar sub-chartered a round trip from Stockholm to London on 28 June. It then operated four flights from Stockholm to Rhodes, Palma de Mallorca and London between 4 and 6 July. Trans Polar claimed that they were flying courtesy trips and that the passengers had agreed to be compensated the part of the package trip which would have been paid to Trans Polar. The arguments were rejected by the CAA, who stated that this was a typical post-excuse and that in case of a courtesy trip the airline should not be collecting the fare in the first place. The incident was investigated by both Norwegian and Swedish police.|$|E

40|$|Mean-variance {{criterion}} {{has long}} been the main stream approach in the optimal portfolio theory. The investors try to balance the risk and the return <b>on</b> <b>their</b> portfolio. In this paper, the deviation of the asset return from the investor's expectation in the worst scenario is used as the measure of risk for portfolio selection. One important advantage of this approach is that the investors can <b>base</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> knowledge, information, and preference on various risks, in addition to the asset's volatility, to adjust their exposure to various risks. It also pinpoints one main concern of the investors when they invest, the amount they lose in the worst situation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. postprin...|$|R

40|$|Radiation {{cystitis}} is {{in general}} rarely occurring, {{which makes it}} very difficult to study in a large group of clinical trials.

We thus want to test fuzzy decision-making model, regarded as a valuable tool, to help in selecting a patient-tailored treatment in radiation cystitis. Theoretical fuzzy decision-making models, possessing the utility matrix filled with distinct utilities of pairs (decision, object-state), give rise to own trials of successfully accomplished applications concerning the item of medication.
