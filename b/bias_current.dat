2500|$|Drain {{efficiency}} is {{the ratio of}} output RF power to input DC power when primary input DC power has been fed to the drain of a field-effect transistor. Based on this definition, the drain efficiency cannot exceed 25% for a class A amplifier that is supplied drain <b>bias</b> <b>current</b> through resistors (because RF signal has its zero level at about 50% of the input DC). Manufacturers specify much higher drain efficiencies, and designers are able to obtain higher efficiencies by providing current to the drain of the transistor through an inductor or a transformer winding.

When the circuit functions as a universal biquad filter, the quality factor and pole frequency can be tuned orthogonally via the input <b>bias</b> <b>currents.</b> When it functions as a quadrature oscillator, the oscillation condition and oscillation frequency can be adjusted indepen-dently by the input <b>bias</b> <b>currents.</b> The proposed circuit can work as either a quadrature oscillator or a biquad filter without changing the circuit topology. The amplitude of the proposed oscillator can be independently controlled via the input <b>bias</b> <b>currents.</b> The proposed oscillator {{can be applied to}} provide amplitude modulated/amplitude shift keyed signals with the above-mentioned major advantages. The circuit is very simple, consisting of four dual-output second generation current controlled current conveyors (DO-CCCIIs), one operational transconductance amplifier (OTA), and two grounded capacitors. Without any external resistors and using only grounded ele-ments, this circuit is therefore suitable for IC architecture.
