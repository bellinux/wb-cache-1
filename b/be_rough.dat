5|$|Sea otters are polygynous: {{males have}} {{multiple}} female partners. However, temporary pair-bonding occurs {{for a few}} days between a female in estrus and her mate. Mating takes place in the water and can <b>be</b> <b>rough,</b> the male biting the female on the muzzle– which often leaves scars on the nose– and sometimes holding her head under water.|$|E
5|$|As seas {{surrounding}} Banton can <b>be</b> <b>rough</b> {{during the}} wet season, {{the best time}} to visit the island is from March to May during the dry (summer) season. This is also the typical time for Asi families living in Metro Manila or abroad to visit the island since it coincides with the Lenten season and barangay fiestas. Within the island, the main forms of transportation are passenger motorcycles (known elsewhere as habal-habal) and motorized boats. A circumferential road connects the 17 barangays of Banton to each other.|$|E
5|$|Plants are {{classified}} as trees, shrubs, herbaceous perennials, and annual herbs (poai); these divisions are acknowledged to <b>be</b> <b>rough</b> and ready, as is the division into wild or cultivated, whereas the aquatic/terrestrial division appeared to be natural. Theophrastus notes that some plants are irregular, while the silver fir has branches always opposite each other and other plants have branches equally spaced or in rows. Figs have the longest roots, while the banyan sends roots down from the shoots, forming a circle of roots at a distance all round the trunk.|$|E

5|$|Maho is Shuichi's sister. She is {{one year}} older than Shuichi is, and at the {{beginning}} of Wandering Son, she is in the sixth grade of elementary school. Maho shows a strong interest in clothes, and spends much of her money on new apparel. She is a big fan of a teen fashion model named Maiko, and to meet her, Maho auditions for the same modeling agency as Maiko. After she is hired and becomes recognized as a model, Maho enjoys being asked her autograph by complete strangers. While her modeling career initially starts out slowly, Maho soon gains confidence in her abilities, and becomes friends with Maiko and two other models, Anna Suehiro and Tamaki Satō. In contrast to her younger sibling, Maho is very out-spoken and tends to <b>be</b> <b>rough</b> with Shuichi, even hitting or slapping Shuichi on occasion, and she often forces things on Shuichi with little consideration of Shuichi's opinion. She does not like Shuichi's cross-dressing and gets angry and disturbed when she finds Shuichi dressed as a girl. In junior high school, Maho becomes attracted to her classmate Riku Seya, and eventually starts dating him.|$|E

25|$|Western Shar Pei {{comes in}} three {{different}} coat types: horse, brush, and bear coat. The unusual horse coat is rough to the touch, extremely prickly and off-standing and {{is closer to the}} original traditional Shar Pei breed in appearance and coat type than the brush or bear coat. This coat is fairly prickly and can <b>be</b> <b>rough</b> or irritating when petting in the opposite direction of the fur. The horse coat is generally thought to be more active and predisposed to dominant behavior than the brush coat.|$|E

It was Hines' reports that encouraged Morgan to <b>be</b> <b>rough</b> with anyone posing as a Confederate sympathizer in Indiana, as Morgan had been relying on support from sympathizers in Indiana to be successful on his raid. [...] Hines stayed with Morgan {{until the end of the}} Raid, and was with John Hunt Morgan during their imprisonment, first [...] at Johnson's Island, and later at the Ohio Penitentiary just outside downtown Columbus, Ohio, where, despite the rules of war dictating that prisoners of war should go to military prison, they were put in with common criminals.|$|E

500|$|The initial {{hours of}} the game, before the player started to acquire {{some of the more}} potent powers, were {{considered}} to be difficult and may be off-putting to some. Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer noted the remainder of the game continues to have some difficult sections, such as sections where the player must defend a moving target against a large number of foes, and considered these to be [...] "repetitive and overlong". Bramwell further commented that the electrical powers in the game are simply electricity-based reimaginings of standard video game weapon archetypes, such as shotguns and sniper rifles, and, with this awareness, leaves the difficulty of the game up to the enemy placement during encounters. [...] The game is also considered to <b>be</b> <b>rough</b> around the edges in technical execution, with the lack of anti-aliasing and occasional [...] "pop-in" [...] rendering, as well as drops in frame rates when there was a significant amount of action on the screen.|$|E
500|$|The {{tower is}} [...] high and has massive masonry walls about [...] thick {{with a number}} of {{apertures}} to let in air. Inside there is a massive column made of concrete. At night, the whole structure is allowed to cool, and during the day warm moist air enters the structure via the high apertures, cools, descends, and leaves the building by the lower apertures. Knapen's intention was that water should condense on the cool inner column. In keeping with Chaptal's finding that the condensing surface must <b>be</b> <b>rough</b> and the surface tension must be sufficiently low that the condensed water can drip, the central column's outer surface was studded with projecting plates of slate. The slates were placed nearly vertically to encourage dripping down to a collecting basin {{at the bottom of the}} structure. Unfortunately, the aerial well never achieved anything like its hoped-for performance and produced no more than a few litres of water each day.|$|E
500|$|Before {{production}} {{began on}} Homogenic, Björk {{wanted to create}} an album with [...] "a simple sound" [...] and [...] "only one flavour". Heather Phares of AllMusic described the sound of Homogenic as a [...] "fusion of chilly strings (courtesy of the Icelandic String Octet), stuttering, abstract beats, and unique touches like accordion and glass harmonica". The album differs from her previous two releases stylistically, and Neva Chonin of Rolling Stone stated the album was [...] "certain to <b>be</b> <b>rough</b> going for fans looking for the sweet melodies and peppy dance collages of her earlier releases". As with other Björk releases, it has been difficult for critics to classify Homogenic within a musical genre. Tiny Mix Tapes considered that [...] "Björk has managed to create something so refreshingly unique that trying to categorize and label the music is rather dubious." [...] Writing for Beats Per Minute, Cole Zercoe felt Homogenic represented a pinnacle work of trip hop, forming part of [...] "a sort of holy trinity of this musical aesthetic" [...] along with Massive Attack's Mezzanine and Portishead's Dummy.|$|E

500|$|For the new pilot, Fox made {{it clear}} that they would not air the episodes in the {{widescreen}} format. Whedon and company felt they had to [...] "serve two masters" [...] by filming widescreen for eventual DVD release, but keeping objects in frame so it could still work when aired in pan and scan full frame. To obtain an immersive and immediate feel, the episodes were filmed in a documentary style with hand-held cameras, giving them the look of [...] "found footage", with deliberately misframed or out-of-focus subjects. As Whedon related: [...] "...don't be arch, don't be sweeping—be found, <b>be</b> <b>rough</b> and tumble and docu and you-are-there". Computer-generated scenes mimicked the motion of a hand-held camera. This style was not used, however, when shooting scenes that involved the central government, the Alliance. Tracking and steady cameras were used to show the sterility of this aspect of the Firefly universe. Another style employed was lens flares harking back to 1970s television. This style was so desired that the director of photography, David Boyd, sent back the cutting-edge lenses which reduced lens flare in exchange for cheaper ones.|$|E
500|$|Sexuality {{and sexual}} {{identity}} {{is the most}} prevalent theme in the novel. The title is an obscure Victorian pornographic slang reference to cunnilingus. Nick Rennison in Contemporary British Authors characterises Tipping the Velvet as an [...] "unabashed and unapologetic celebration of lesbian eroticism and sexual diversity". Donna Allegra writes with appreciation of how the existence of Waters' characters in a heterosexual existence forces an analysis of closeted positions. The sexism of the period puts a stranglehold on women, forcing readers to compare women in the Victorian era with present-day sexual attitudes. Nan never has difficulty accepting her love for Kitty Butler and other women; Kitty's union with Walter, however, [...] "reeks of lesbophobia", according to Allegra. Music halls could <b>be</b> <b>rough</b> in some areas, but Kitty is shown handling drunken and rowdy audiences with humour and grace. The only instance where she is overcome and flees the stage is when a drunken patron shouts a euphemism for a lesbian at her. This episode leads to the final scene of Part I when Nan stumbles upon Kitty and Walter in bed. Kitty does not display any pleasure in their union, but rather complacence tinged with shame. Allegra compares Kitty's desire for normality overshadowing her desire for love with Nan to [...] "compulsory heterosexuality... emblematic of and particular to lesbian existence".|$|E
