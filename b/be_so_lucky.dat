500|$|The {{second season}} of Homicide drew several {{comparisons}} to NYPD Blue, an ABC police drama series that had debuted in September 1993. It received {{a large amount}} of publicity and better ratings than Homicide, which some reviewers attributed to the violence and nudity featured in the show. Like Homicide, NYPD Blue featured an ensemble cast and intertwined subplots, and commentators suggested its success may have encouraged NBC to support Homicide. Levinson said he was not deterred by comparisons to NYPD Blue because Homicide debuted before that series. In a news article, Fontana quoted a friend who described NYPD Blue as [...] "the television version of Homicide". Baldwin was even more critical of the show, and said in an interview: [...] "The ultimate compliment that can ever be paid [...] to be mimicked by someone else. So, thank you, NYPD Blue, because it's the knockoff of Homicide." [...] NYPD Blue co-creator Steven Bochco took exception to that characterization, saying he believed his reputation and experience in television proved he was capable of conceiving his own material. Bochco said: I don't think it's a knock-off. It was conceived as its own show. I wish Homicide the best [...] and they should <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>lucky</b> as to do as well as we're doing right now." ...|$|E
500|$|Barzun Donnelly {{recommended}} to Hynes that he consider Lou Taylor Pucci {{for the lead}} role of Mercer, believing that he was [...] "perfect". Hynes watched Pucci's 2005 film Thumbsucker and thought that [...] "We'd <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>lucky</b> to have him." [...] He contacted Pucci about the role but was leaving for Norway {{in less than a}} week to attend a friend's wedding and wanted to meet with him before leaving. Pucci was in San Francisco on a press tour and Hynes flew from Los Angeles to have lunch with him. Hynes said of the meeting, [...] "I think we really [...] each other," [...] and Pucci accepted the role a week later. Jena Malone signed on to portray Joely because she [...] "loved the script" [...] and was keen to play [...] "a woman on the cusp of learning to toy with her [...] sexual manipulation"; she only later learned that Hynes had written the role with her in mind, having previously worked with her on the short film Al as in Al. Hynes said that Zooey Deschanel, Maura Tierney, and Bill Duke each joined the cast because they [...] "read [...] and really liked it". He made a deliberate attempt to cast Deschanel and Malone against their previous types. He described Deschanel as a [...] "glamour girl" [...] and Malone as a sexually mature woman.|$|E
500|$|Minogue {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{with a number of}} honorific nicknames. She has been compared to American recording artist Madonna in many media outlets, with Madonna identified as Queen of Pop and Minogue as the Princess of Pop. Birmingham Post said in 2000; [...] "nce upon a time, long before anybody had even heard of Britney, Christina, Jessica or Mandy, Australian singer Kylie Minogue ruled the charts as princess of pop. Back in 1988 her first single, I Should <b>Be</b> <b>So</b> <b>Lucky,</b> spent five weeks at number one, making her the most successful female artist in the UK charts with 13 successive Top 10 entries." [...] She is sometimes referred to as the Goddess of Pop/Pop Goddess. She has also been dubbed a Disco Queen. William Baker, co-author of her book , talking about her song [...] "Better the Devil You Know", commented, [...] "The track transferred well onto the dance-floor and heralded a long reign for Kylie as the new queen of disco... a pop princess." [...] Jon O'Brien from Allmusic reviewed her box-set [...] and stated [...] "Kylie has yet to make that one essential album, and the going-through-the-motions nature of her later releases suggests her time may have passed, but this box set still contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses." [...] In November 2011, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the ARIA Music Awards, she was inducted by the Australian Recording Industry Association into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Many celebrities have named Minogue as a role model. Many media outlets have said many people, particularly woman, have undergone regular checks for cancer symptoms since her breast cancer diagnosis. In December 2006, Sugar named her the Most Inspirational Celebrity as voted by teenage girls. Editor of the magazine Annabel Brog stated, [...] " [...] couldn't be any more inspirational. She's friendly, gorgeous, talented – and this year she's shown just how strong she is too." [...] Television host Giuliana Rancic cited Minogue's cancer story as [...] "inspirational" [...] when she too was diagnosed with cancer. She said, [...] "When you get diagnosed, you don't know what to do… you Google. I went online and I read your story, and it gave me the strength to go public as well." [...] Musical entertainers who have cited Minogue as an influence include September, Diana Vickers, Paris Hilton, and The Veronicas.|$|E

According {{to the music}} sheet on MusicNotes.com, which was published by Universal Music Publishing Group, the song {{is set in the}} key of C major. Minogue's vocals span from D4 to C5. [...] The song is set in common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 116 beats per minute. Instrumentation of the song features synthesizers, keyboards and guitars. According to PopMatters, they said the song features [...] "numerous orchestra hits to the uncomfortably thin sounding drum machine." [...] Waterman has said the tune was inspired by Pachelbel's Canon. Stock told the Guardian: [...] "Anyone who thinks I Should <b>Be</b> <b>So</b> <b>Lucky</b> is easy should try to play it.
