5|$|Sargent as {{composer}} attracted favourable {{notice in}} a Prom season when other composer-conductors included Gustav Holst with his Planets suite, {{and the next}} year, Wood included a nocturne and scherzo by Sargent in the Proms programme, also conducted by the composer. Sargent was invited to conduct the Impression again in the 1923 season, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> a conductor that he made the greater impact. On the advice of Wood, among others, he soon abandoned composition in favour of conducting. He founded the amateur Leicester Symphony Orchestra in 1922, which he continued to conduct until 1939. Under Sargent, the orchestra's prestige grew until {{it was able to}} obtain such top-flight soloists as Alfred Cortot, Artur Schnabel, Solomon, Guilhermina Suggia and Benno Moiseiwitsch. Moiseiwitsch gave Sargent piano lessons without charge, judging him talented enough to make a successful career as a concert pianist, but Sargent chose a conducting career. At the instigation of Wood and Adrian Boult he became a lecturer at the Royal College of Music in London in 1923.|$|E

His huge visionary paintings Christ Overcoming Space and Eternity Diadem, and Consider the Lilies (depicting hymn-singing weavers) attempt to show the triumph of man's spirit over mass production. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> a writer that he is most widely known.|$|R
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> {{singer of}} English art-song, and the friend of many leading English composers, that Elwes left his most {{permanent}} legacy. He was the dedicatee and first performer of (and {{the first person}} to record) Ralph Vaughan Williams song cycle On Wenlock Edge and many of the finest songs of Roger Quilter (including the cycle To Julia), both of whom wrote with his voice in mind. In 1912 he gave the first performance of Thomas Dunhill's song-cycle The Wind Among the Reeds for the Philharmonic Society. He had the wholehearted admiration of every generation from Charles Villiers Stanford to Frank Bridge, and their successors still acknowledge the authority of his influence. He was also a wonderful inspiration to leading British singers of his time, as their many private and published memorials testify.|$|E
25|$|The Colts {{took the}} opening kickoff and stormed down the field. James gained 39 {{yards on the}} first five plays of the drive, and then Manning {{finished}} it with a 31-yard touchdown pass to Stokley. Denver responded on their ensuing drive, advancing the ball 49 yards in 12 plays and taking 8:13 off the clock. Jason Elam capped off the drive with a 49-yard field goal to cut their deficit to 7–3, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> close as Denver would ever get {{for the rest of}} the game. After the kickoff, Harrison caught three passes for 70 yards, including a pass in which he made a diving catch around three Denver players. All of them thought Harrison was down by contact and started to leave the field, but no one had actually touched him, and Harrison got back up and ran 46 yards for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|On Giorgione's {{premature}} death, Titian {{completed the}} painting {{and went on to}} paint a great many more naked women, most frequently, as Botticelli did, disguising them as goddesses and surrounding them with sylvan woods and starry skies to make perfect decoration for the walls of rich clientele. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> a painter of portraits that Titian excelled, his longevity allowing him to achieve far more, both in the way of production and in stylistic development than either Giorgione or his Florentine contemporary Raphael were able to. Titian gave the world images of Pietro Aretino and Pope Paul III and many other people of his day, perhaps his most powerful portrait being that of Doge Andrea Gritti, ruler of Venice, who looms large in the picture space, one huge hand clasping his heavily buttoned robe in a dynamic Expressionistic gesture. Titian is also renowned for his religious painting, his last work being a turbulent and abstracted Pietà.|$|E

25|$|Scott {{was born}} in Toorak, Victoria, and soon moved to Melbourne, where he began to play cricket at a high level. He made his {{first-class}} debut in February 1878, and was soon chosen for the Australian team. By {{the time of the}} 1886 Australian tour of England, he had been appointed captain, but he remained in England at the tour's conclusion to pursue a career in medicine, and played no further first-class cricket. Scott began as a right arm fast-medium bowler and achieved his best analysis of six wickets for 33 runs on his first-class debut. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> a middle order batsman that Scott developed into an international player. He scored four first-class centuries, including one for Australia when he scored 102 at The Oval in 1884. Scott assumed the leadership of the Australian team following a dispute between English and Australian authorities which resulted in the dropping of Billy Murdoch, the Australian captain. However, the team which he led was afflicted by internal disputes over which he could exert no authority, and the tour was unsuccessful.|$|E

Perks was another outstanding broodmare who continued the maternal family success, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> a dam of stallions that ChicadoV is best known; three of her sons—Triple Chick, Three Chicks, and The Ole Man—became leading race sires. Triple Chick not only sired race horses, but show horses as well, including Boston Mac and Triple's Image. Three Chicks sired the All American Futurity winner Three Oh's and the racehorse stallion Azure Three. The Ole Man sired 1,876 foals, including 15 stakes winners and 10 AQHA Champions.|$|E
500|$|Black Swan had {{its world}} premiere as the opening film at the 67th Venice Film Festival on September 1, 2010.

The festival's artistic director Marco Mueller had chosen Black Swan over The American (starring George Clooney) for opening film, saying, [...] " [...] was just a better fit... Clooney is a wonderful actor, and he will always be welcome in Venice. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> simple as that." [...] Black Swan screened in competition and is the third consecutive film directed by Aronofsky to premiere at the festival, following The Fountain and The Wrestler. Black Swan was presented in a sneak screening at the Telluride Film Festival on September 5, 2010. It also had a Gala screening at the 35th Toronto International Film Festival later in the month. In October 2010, Black Swan was screened at the New Orleans Film Festival, the Austin Film Festival, and the BFI London Film Festival. In November 2010, the film was screened at American Film Institute's AFI Fest in Los Angeles, the Denver Film Festival and Camerimage Festival in Bydgoszcz, Poland.|$|E

[...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger said that Frank turning into Liz [...] "felt a little too predictable", nonetheless complimented Judah Friedlander for it. Regarding the episode itself, Sepinwall wrote {{that it was a}} [...] "great story, and a much better closing point to the 'Dealbreakers' plot". Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad objected to the jokes about Liz and Fey being unattractive, but was glad that Liz did not get her talk show, reasoning it would have [...] "ruin the whole Liz/Jack/TGS dynamic." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik was complimentary towards the [...] "Dealbreakers" [...] story, and commented that the series [...] "has often been strongest in the episodes in which Liz Lemon's professional life tracks Tina Fey's, and 'Dealbreakers' was definitely one of them." [...] In conclusion, Poniewozik said that despite this not being [...] "an all-time classic" [...] it was [...] "one of the most laugh-full 30 Rocks in a while". TV Guides Michael Anthony reported that part of him really wanted to see the Dealbreaker pilot work out for Liz, noting [...] "I think there's something there– something really funny!"

2500|$|As a {{composer}} of motets, Lassus {{was one of}} the most diverse and prodigious of the entire Renaissance. His output varies from the sublime to the ridiculous, and he showed a sense of humor not often associated with sacred music: [...] for example, one of his motets satirizes poor singers (his setting of Super flumina Babylonis, for five voices) which includes stuttering, stopping and starting, and general confusion; it is related in concept if not in style to Mozart's A Musical Joke. Many of his motets were composed for ceremonial occasions, as could be expected of a court composer who was required to provide music for visits of dignitaries, weddings, treaties and other events of state. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> {{a composer}} of religious motets that Lassus achieved his widest and most lasting fame.|$|E
2500|$|A large {{migration}} of Garifuna {{had come up}} the coast from Honduras in 1832, to what became Punta Gorda and Dangriga {{in the south of}} Belize.

By the 19th century they were settling along the southern coastline of Belize. They had been catechized by Spanish priests while on St. Vincent, as evidenced in “makeshift beads and crosses to ward off evil and danger." [...] They would be sought after by the British as strong warriors and sturdy workers. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> good students and educators that they impacted Catholicism in Belize, with several priests and the first native bishop coming from their number.
