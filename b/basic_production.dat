25|$|Approximately 63 {{percent of}} the {{population}} was located in rural areas, where the majority of people worked in agriculture and rural industries. Under the responsibility system for agriculture instituted in 1981, the household replaced the production team as the <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> unit. Families contracted with the economic collective to farm a plot of land, delivered a set amount of grain or other produce and the agricultural tax to the state, and paid a fee to the collective. After meeting these obligations, the household was free to retain its surplus produce or sell it on free markets. Restrictions on private plots and household sideline production were lifted, and much of the produce from these was also sold on free markets.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{a survey}} of 48 {{communities}} in central Honduras, this paper identifies the major pathways of development that have been occurring in central Honduras since the mid- 1970 s, their causes and implications for agricultural productivity, natural resource sustainability, and poverty. Six pathways of development were identified: 1) basic grains expansion communities-where <b>basic</b> grains <b>production</b> is the dominant activity and increased <b>basic</b> grains <b>production</b> has occurred; 2) basic grains stagnation communities-where <b>basic</b> grains <b>production</b> is dominant but has stagnated or declined; 3) coffee expansion communities-where coffee production is important and has been increasing in importance; 4) horticultural expansion communities-where substantial adoption and expansion of horticultural crops has occurred; 5) forestry specialization communities-where forestry activities are important and <b>basic</b> grains <b>production</b> is stagnant or declining; and 6) nonfarm employment communities-where nonfarm employment is a major and increasing source of income. The findings imply that a “one-size-fits-all” approach to technical assistance {{is unlikely to be}} successful, since different approaches show promise in different pathways.

25|$|The AWPD {{went beyond}} {{offering}} <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> requirements and provided instead a comprehensive air plan {{which was designed}} to defeat the Axis powers. The plan, AWPD-1, was completed in nine days. The plan emphasized using heavy bombers to carry out precision bombing attacks as the primary method of defeating Germany and her allies. A year later, after the United States became directly involved in World War II, AWPD delivered a second plan—AWPD-42—which slightly changed the earlier plan to incorporate lessons learned from eight months of war. Neither AWPD-1 nor AWPD-42 were approved as combat battle plans or war operations; they were simply accepted as guidelines for the production of materiel and the creation of necessary air squadrons. Finally in 1943, an operational aerial warfare plan was hammered out in meetings between American and British war planners, based on a combination of British plans and those from the AWPD, to create the Anglo-American Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO).|$|E

Josh Alexander and Billy Steinberg co-wrote the song with Toby Gad, and co-produced it with Steve Angello (from Swedish House Mafia), Rami Yacoub, and Carl Falk. A small snippet {{of the song}} leaked online in January 2011, and upon appearing online, UK entertainment website Digital Spy noted that an unfinished demo of the song leaked online back in June 2010. The demo features vocals from US record producer-rapper Timbaland and American singer-songwriter Keri Hilson.

Robinson said that the second demo that leaked on January 13, 2011 was more similar to the final single version as opposed to the earlier 2010 demo. A third unfinished version, this time with Scherzinger's vocals, leaked on January 14, 2011 with a more <b>basic</b> <b>production.</b> Rap-Up posted the final single version also on January 14, 2011.

40|$|Recently, PT. Iskandar Indah Printing Textile {{is faced}} {{a very tight}} {{competition}} from the companies operating in the similar area. When the company does not apply an appropriate strategy, the company will go bankrupt. The improper production cost determination {{will lead to the}} too high or too low product sell price. In this research, the writer is limited to the weaving department only. Such department carries out the production process based on order from the consumer so that the appropriate <b>production</b> <b>basic</b> cost calculation is job order costing. The method applied in weaving department has been correct, but there is still the cost calculation and allocation not consistent with the theory so that evaluation on the <b>production</b> <b>basic</b> cost is required. This research aims to find out the production costs calculation and allocation using job order costing method applied in PT. Iskandar Indah Printing Textile particularly in the weaving department. Having identified the <b>production</b> <b>basic</b> cost calculation applied in that company, the evaluation on the <b>production</b> <b>basic</b> cost calculation was done using job order costing. The evaluation will show the strength and weakness from the <b>production</b> <b>basic</b> cost allocation and calculation in <b>production</b> <b>basic</b> cost applied in PT. Iskandar Indah Printing Textile. The result of research obtained by the writer shows that the company had chosen an appropriate <b>production</b> <b>basic</b> cost calculation because the weaving department of company carries out the production process based on the customer order and each cost included in the <b>production</b> <b>basic</b> cost has been adjusted to the order. The error occurring in the company calculation is the production cost categorization. Indirect labor, supporting material, as well as electrical costs are included in the company’s factory overhead cost so that there are only three cost group in calculating the <b>production</b> <b>basic</b> cost with this method, namely basic material, indirect labor, and factory overhead costs. Order basic cost card should be made for assisting the company in undertaking production cost record and details of each order. This card can then be filed for the company record.

The pathways were distinguished by factors determining comparative advantage, including agricultural potential, population density, and access to markets and technology. Changes in agriculture and resource management differ significantly among these pathways, though poverty was found to decline to a similar extent across all pathways. It appears that the key causes of change in productivity and resource management are different and more pathway-dependent than the key causes of change in poverty, which depends {{to a great extent}} on provision of public services. Basic infrastructure and public services are badly needed throughout most of central Honduras, while efforts to address sustainable agricultural development may not b [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{sector is}} the largest industrial energy user, but detailed analysis of its energy use developments lags behind other energy-intensive sectors. A cost-driven forecasting model for <b>basic</b> chemicals <b>production</b> is developed, accounting for regional production costs, demand growth and stock turnover. The model determines the global production capacity placement, implementation of energy-efficient Best Practice Technology (BPT) and global carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions for the period 2010 – 2030. Subsequently, the effects of energy and climate policies on these parameters are quantified. About 60 % of new <b>basic</b> chemical <b>production</b> capacity is projected {{to be placed in}} non-OECD regions by 2030 due to low energy prices. While global production increases by 80 % between 2010 and 2030, the OECD's production capacity share decreases from 40 % to 20 % and global emissions increase by 50 %. Energy pricing and climate policies are found to reduce 2030 CO 2 emissions by 5 – 15 % relative to the baseline developments by increasing BPT implementation. Maximum BPT implementation results in a 25 % reduction. Further emission reductions require measures beyond energy-efficient technologies. The model is useful to estimate general trends related to <b>basic</b> chemicals <b>production,</b> but improved data from the chemical sector is required to expand the analysis to additional technologies and chemicals...|$|R
