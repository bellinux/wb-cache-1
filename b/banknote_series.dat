5|$|Information {{about the}} 2008 <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> which {{involved}} {{the issue of}} such notes {{can be found in}} the section Paper money of the third dollar (ZWR).|$|E
5|$|The 2007 <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> was {{prepared}} by the Reserve Bank in October 2006 for the abandoned second phase of Operation Sunrise. The Chiremba Balancing Rocks was to be reinstated as the main feature on the obverse whilst use of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark continued. There were additional security features as opposed to previous issues, which included security threads, see-through register marks and recognition marks for the partially sighted. Holographic security threads and Optically Variable Ink were used on the $100, $500 and $1000 notes. When the redenomination of 1 August 2008 occurred these notes were put into circulation as banknotes of the third dollar between 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Zimbabwe dollar {{was again}} {{reformed}} on 2 February 2009 when the fourth dollar replaced the third dollar {{at the ratio}} of 1000000000000 (1012) to 1 with the original intention of phasing out the latter by 1 July 2009. The 2009 <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> was issued for the fourth dollar which circulated from 2 February 2009 until the suspension of the dollar on 12 April 2009. The series consisted of denominations ranging from $1 to $500. The notes had a revised design with chevrons as registration devices, the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable Ink and an iridescent strip. Most parts of the design were recycled from designs of past issues {{and do not have}} a watermark although a plain space existed in the areas where it would normally be positioned.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, she {{submitted}} {{designs for}} the Swiss National Bank's banknote design competition. Her designs, focusing on Switzerland as a tourist destination, were awarded second place. In February 2007, the National Bank chose her submission {{as the basis of}} the new <b>banknotes</b> <b>series,</b> which was scheduled to be issued - in a much reworked design - in 2016.|$|R
5|$|The Gideon Gono {{series of}} 2004 carried the {{signature}} of the incumbent Reserve Bank governor, Dr. Gideon Gono and consisted of only one denomination of the first dollar ($500). This was the last <b>series</b> of regular <b>banknotes</b> of the first dollar, as hyperinflation forced all regular <b>banknotes</b> <b>series</b> out of use, although remaining legal tender theoretically until 21 August 2006.|$|R
50|$|Honegger {{is pictured}} on the Swiss twenty franc <b>banknote</b> (eighth <b>series)</b> issued October 1996, {{and due to}} be {{replaced}} in 2017.|$|R
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{denominations}} issued in late-2008 {{as well as the}} suspension of paper supply by Giesecke & Devrient affected the Reserve Bank's ability to maintain the quality of the banknotes. Later denominations copied design features from the original 2007 <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> and lacked many modern security features that banknotes of major currencies (such as the Canadian Dollar) relied on. The notes denominated from $20000 to $500000 and then from $10 million onwards used non-watermarked paper, whilst the $500 million notes were printed on pure cotton. A silhouette of the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable Ink was used in such notes to compensate for this, but the iridescent strip was dropped for higher denominations. The $10000 and $1000000 notes reused paper for the $1000 notes (Pick no. 72), thereby carrying the embedded holographic thread and watermark. Two types of paper (regular and lined) were used on $20000, $50000 and $500000 banknotes.|$|E
25|$|The {{security}} features make counterfeiting the banknotes {{more difficult than}} counterfeiting earlier <b>banknote</b> <b>series.</b>|$|E
25|$|The English Series were Philippine {{banknotes}} that circulated from 1951 to 1971. It was {{the only}} <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> of the Philippine peso to use English as the language.|$|E
25|$|The Europa <b>series</b> euro <b>banknotes</b> are {{supposedly}} {{more durable}} {{than the first}} <b>series</b> <b>banknotes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} security of the substrate and the integration of security features in the banknote designs, the Bank of Canada also launched a public education campaign, actively deterred counterfeiting by closer collaboration with law enforcement, and accelerated the removal and destruction of <b>banknotes</b> from older <b>series</b> from circulation. Moreover, it actively discourages financial transactions using <b>banknotes</b> from older <b>series.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Series C Banknotes (...) of Ireland {{were the}} final series of notes {{created for the}} state {{before the advent of}} the euro; it {{replaced}} Series B <b>Banknotes.</b> The <b>series</b> gradually entered circulation from 1992 and remained in circulation until 2002.|$|R
25|$|The Birds of Canada <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> was released. The 1986 {{series of}} bank notes was {{designed}} with enhanced security features to counter developments in colour-copier technology {{available to the}} public, and therefore available to potential counterfeiters.|$|E
25|$|Escudo {{banknotes}} celebrated notable {{figures from}} the history of Portugal. The final <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> featured the Age of Discovery, with João de Barros, Pedro Álvares Cabral, Bartolomeu Dias, Vasco da Gama, and Henry the Navigator.|$|E
25|$|In {{this final}} <b>banknote</b> <b>series,</b> Bank of Finland used a {{photograph}} of Väinö Linna on the 20-markkaa note without permission from copyright holders.

2500|$|The first <b>banknote</b> of the <b>series</b> is the 10 pengő bill, {{which is}} dated 1936 {{but was not}} put into {{circulation}} earlier than 1939. This banknote {{was followed by the}} 5 pengő bill (dated 1939), then the 2 pengő (1940) and the 20 pengő bills (1941). A 100 pengő note was also planned, however, it was printed in a slightly different version and only used by the evacuated troops in Austria. The <b>banknotes</b> of the <b>series</b> were designed by Endre Horváth) ...|$|R
25|$|In 1959, the old won was {{replaced}} with the Second Won, with price and exchange rates fixed to the U.S. dollar. This <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> was issued in denominations of 50 chon, and 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. These notes were {{much larger than the}} previous issue and depicted images representing various industries in the economy.|$|E
25|$|The Frontier Series is {{the seventh}} series of {{banknotes}} of the Canadian dollar {{released by the}} Bank of Canada. The polymer banknotes were designed to increase durability and to incorporate more security features over the preceding Canadian Journey Series. The notes feature images that focus on historic Canadian achievements and innovation. It is the first <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> issued by the Bank of Canada printed on a material other than paper.|$|E
25|$|Each {{denomination}} {{contains the}} EURion constellation {{on both the}} obverse and reverse to deter counterfeiting by reproduction using imaging software and photocopiers, the second Canadian <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> to include it after the Canadian Journey Series. On the obverse, the pattern occurs flanking the transparent window, with denominations having the same pattern {{on the right and}} different patterns on the left. On the reverse, it occurs in the lower strip containing the banknote's serial number.|$|E
5000|$|Microprinting: Some {{areas of}} the <b>banknote</b> feature a <b>series</b> of tiny letters. The microprinting can be read with a {{magnifying}} glass. The letters are sharp, not blurred.|$|R
50|$|All the {{denominations}} of banknotes (except for €500) of Europa series {{should start}} {{to be released}} {{by the end of}} 2018, the date when all the first <b>series</b> <b>banknotes</b> will be no more released.|$|R
50|$|In 1938, {{the designs}} were {{modified}} to mitigate printing {{problems of the}} original design, increasing {{the width of the}} signature panel by 2.4 mm. All <b>banknotes</b> in the <b>series</b> measure 152.4 by 73.025 mm.|$|R
25|$|In 1979, the {{currency}} was again reformed, {{and a new}} <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> was issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. There is ongoing speculation as to why this move was made. All 1959 banknotes were removed from circulation. Circulating coins, however, were not affected by this change. The designs for this issue were much more symbolic and charismatic than previous ones, with Kim Il-sung featuring {{for the first time}} on the 100 won.|$|E
25|$|Printing of the $1 note ceased in 1989 {{after the}} release of the loonie (in 1987) had been implemented. These notes are {{virtually}} never seen in circulation today. The most recent <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> that included the $1 note was the Scenes of Canada, with the $1 note released in 1974, coloured green and black. The face featured a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II; the back featured an image of Parliament Hill from across the Ottawa River, with log driving activities taking place on the water.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the first}} <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> issued by the Bank of Canada printed on a {{material}} other than paper, and Canada {{is now one of}} over 30 nations using polymer thin films for printing currency. To familiarise Canadians with the new banknotes, each denomination was introduced through national and regional unveiling events and advertising campaigns before being put into circulation. The banknotes are non-porous and are expected to remain cleaner as they will not absorb sweat, oils, or other liquids, and will stay in circulation longer than paper-based banknotes.|$|E
25|$|All the {{denominations}} of banknotes (except for €500) of Europa series {{should start}} {{to be released}} {{by the end of}} 2018, the date when further issue of all of the first <b>series</b> <b>banknotes</b> will cease.|$|R
50|$|Designs on {{the reverse}} of each <b>banknote</b> in the <b>series</b> were based on themes of {{fundamental}} Canadian values and achievements. The $20 banknote was awarded 2004 Banknote of the Year by the International Bank Note Society.|$|R
50|$|The Glenfinnan Viaduct {{features}} on some Scottish <b>banknotes.</b> The 2007 <b>series</b> of notes {{issued by the}} Bank of Scotland depicts different bridges in Scotland as examples of Scottish engineering, and the £10 note features the Glenfinnan Viaduct.|$|R
25|$|When Cabral was {{appointed}} Treasurer the <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> was changed from series 2003 to series 2003A {{to indicate that}} a new Treasurer had been appointed, but not a new Secretary of the Treasury. Her signature appeared {{on all of the}} series 2003A and series 2006 banknotes which began production in May 2005. While her 5-year term as Treasurer ended on January 20, 2009 with the beginning of the Obama Administration, her signature continued to appear on the series 2006A $100 banknote, which was printed until May 2013, pending the resolution of production problems with the new color $100 banknote.|$|E
25|$|The Tajikistani ruble {{banknotes}} have {{a striking}} similarity to the 1961, 1991 and 1992 <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> of the Soviet/Russian ruble, with similar size, colour scheme, positioning {{of objects and}} the font. The colour schemes {{can be traced back}} to the later issues of the Russian Empire. Many of the old printing templates used for the production of Soviet ruble notes were used on Tajikistan's notes. This is because the Tajikistani ruble was printed under the direction of Goznak, the official Russian agency responsible for the production of banknotes and coins. Some of the old printing templates used for Soviet notes were used on Tajikistan notes.|$|E
25|$|Printing of the $2 note ceased on February 18, 1996, {{with the}} release of the toonie, a coin that {{replaced}} it. These notes are virtually never seen in circulation today. The most recent <b>banknote</b> <b>series</b> that included the two-dollar note was the Birds of Canada series in 1986, in which the two was a terra cotta colour. The face featured a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II; the back featured a meadow scene with two robins. Prior to the withdrawal of the $1 note, the $2 was not as widely circulated and was difficult to find in some regions, Alberta in particular. After the $1 note was withdrawn, the $2 was much more widely circulated.|$|E
50|$|New <b>banknotes</b> of the <b>series</b> 2007-2015 with {{values of}} 2 to 100 BsF {{have been issued}} since 20 March 2007. The greater the values, the longer re-issuing occurred. Only the 100-BsF-note had been re-issued in November 2015.|$|R
50|$|All <b>banknotes</b> in the <b>series</b> {{feature a}} stylised Flag of Canada {{in the upper}} {{right-hand}} corner of the obverse, and measured 152.4 by 69.85 mm. Each banknote also included an excerpt from literary works reflecting the denomination's theme.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} each <b>banknote</b> in the <b>series</b> {{incorporates}} various security devices. When the banknotes are tilted, various motifs {{appear in the}} hologram. Also, fluorescent colours, which are visible under ultraviolet light, are used {{on both sides of}} the banknotes.|$|R
