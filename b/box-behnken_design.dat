50|$|Each design can {{be thought}} of as a {{combination}} of a two-level (full or fractional) factorial design with an incomplete block design. In each block, a certain number of factors are put through all combinations for the factorial design, while the other factors are kept at the central values. For instance, the <b>Box-Behnken</b> <b>design</b> for 3 factors involves three blocks, in each of which 2 factors are varied through the 4 possible combinations of high and low. It is necessary to include centre points as well (in which all factors are at their central values).|$|E

For K variables, P = 1(Start) + K(Stage I) + (K2 − K)/2(Stage II) + 3K(Stage III) = 0.5K2 + 3.5K + 1.
