25|$|The firm {{suddenly}} found itself without {{the vast majority}} of its business (despite later receiving financial compensation for the physical assets seized by Mobutu's regime) but managed to survive: full ownership passed to conglomerate Société Générale de Belgique, where it was grouped with its other metals and mining interests. As a reflection of its enforced departure from the Katanga Province, the new, simplified name Union Minière was adopted. With its more European focus, Union Minière began to grow its business again through the 1980s, initially largely organically. In 1989 however, Société Générale announced plans to merge Union Minière with three other Belgian metals companies in which it held a significant stake: zinc producer Vieille Montagne (with a history stretching back to 1805); Metallurgie Hoboken-Overpelt, which dealt {{in a wide range of}} metals including copper, cobalt, and lead; and Mechim, an engineering firm. The much enlarged company was initially renamed Acec-Union Minière (although the prefix was dropped in 1992) and subsequently set about streamlining its organisational structure, but the global economic downturn of the early-to-mid-1990s hit profits and forced management to implement a major restructuring programme in 1995. The three-year plan, implemented under the guidance of recently appointed CEO Karel Vinck, involved the loss of around 25% of Union Minière's workforce and the sale of a number of non-core assets, including a zinc wire operation, French roofing material retailer Asturienne and much of the company's exposure to the diamond products sector (including Diamant <b>Boart).</b>|$|E

50|$|Despite {{ownership}} by Anglo American {{for more}} than 30 years, <b>Boart</b> Longyear was considered a non-core asset for the Johannesburg based mining company. In 2005, <b>Boart</b> Longyear was acquired by the private equity firms Advent International, Bain Capital, and several management investors. The headquarters were then moved to Salt Lake City. Since the sale by Anglo American, management has undertaken a number of ownership changes, restructuring initiatives, and acquisitions, establishing <b>Boart</b> Longyear as a global leader in mining exploration services and products. By October 2006, Advent sold <b>Boart</b> Longyear to the Australian investment firm, Macquarie Bank, and, in April 2007, Macquarie took <b>Boart</b> Longyear public in an A$2.3 billion IPO on the ASX stock exchange. <b>Boart</b> Longyear’s IPO was the second largest IPO {{in the history of}} the ASX.

50|$|The Ghislenghien {{industrial}} park near Ath {{was the scene}} of one of Belgium's worst ever industrial disasters on July 30, 2004. Around 8:30 am local time, workers constructing a new factory for abrasives firm Diamant <b>Boart</b> (a subsidiary of the Electrolux Group) reported a strong smell of gas. It is believed the gas was escaping from a high-pressure underground pipeline conveying natural gas from Zeebrugge to France, operated by gas transportation company Fluxys. Firefighters were soon on the scene and were attempting to clear the area when at least two explosions occurred at around 9:00 am. The strongest of these demolished the partly built Diamant <b>Boart</b> structure, and fires were started in several other buildings. The official death-toll has risen to 23, with over 120 injured. Five volunteer firemen and one police officer were among the dead.|$|E

5000|$|In the mid-1920s (possibly 1927), {{during a}} diamond rush in South Africa, a 35-carat piece of <b>boart</b> {{was found in}} Lichtenberg. The <b>boart</b> was sent to Goudvis Brothers, a firm in Amsterdam. There was initial {{disagreement}} over whether the <b>boart</b> was of any worth. Seven months were spent polishing and examining the stone, and the final 5.05-carat emerald-cut diamond was completed. It was said that the diamond had the appearance of [...] "a drop of blood" [...] when held near a candle. Tiffany & Co. offered $100,000 for the diamond, but the Goudvis Brothers declined the offer, because they wanted $150,000. When World War II began, it was locked in a safe in Arnhem. In 1944, however, the Nazis, who occupied the Netherlands, confiscated the diamond. It was then taken to Germany {{and placed in a}} salt mine in Berchtesgaden, near a retreat belonging to Adolf Hitler. The Nazis had also hidden some other stolen items in the mine. After the war ended, Joseph McNarney, an American general, found the diamond and thought it was a ruby. After it was discovered that the stone was not a ruby, it was returned to the Goudvis Brothers' estate, which was in debt {{as a result of the}} war. The diamond was sold for 57,000 guilders to George Prins, a broker. Sir Ernest Oppenheimer bought the diamond, and later sold it to the Royal Asscher Diamond Company. It was then purchased by a private collector. In February 2007, upon identifying the diamond, the Kazanjian Brothers, a jewelry company in Beverly Hills, purchased the diamond from a woman in East Asia. The diamond, which was previously known as the [...] "Red Diamond", was then named the [...] "Kazanjian Red Diamond". The diamond is now displayed around the world to raise funds for charity efforts.|$|E

50|$|By the 1920s, {{about half}} of the Company's {{drilling}} was outside the continental United States. Robert Longyear (E.J.’s son) became president of the firm in 1924, preserving the chain of family ownership and management that would continue for another 40 years. In 1929, Longyear sold almost US$1.5 million worth of drilling equipment to other drillers. The following year the company formed its first foreign subsidiary in Canada. The company also signed its first contract for work in Africa, sending equipment and a crew to provide drilling for copper ores. However, the stock market crash of October 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression reduced earnings to $79,000 in 1933. During the 1930s, Longyear took on a project drilling for core samples for the proposed Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In spite of the financial crisis, the 1930s saw improvements in diamond drilling technology, including the use of industrial-quality diamonds mined in Africa that were called “boarts.” In 1936, South Africa’s Anglo American Corporation formed <b>Boart</b> Products South Africa (Pty) Limited, which was later named <b>Boart</b> International. The new company developed the first mechanically-set diamond core bits, which were less expensive than the hand-set core bits that used more expensive Brazilian diamonds (carbonados).|$|E
50|$|<b>Boart</b> Longyear {{engineers}} in North Bay, Ontario, secured a reliable source of high-performance synthetic diamonds, which triggered {{the development of}} a new bit design - the impregnated-diamond bit. With decades of powder metallurgy experience behind them, Longyear engineers set out to develop a new crown that consisted of synthetic diamonds evenly distributed throughout a composite matrix. This new design could drill further and faster than surface-set bits and cut through much harder material. By 1980, 75 percent of Longyear’s Canadian-produced bits were of the new impregnated type, and Longyear was manufacturing diamond bits in more than eight countries.|$|E

On January 12 of 2016, Castroville agreed to incorporate a desalination return water project, which would allow the city to gain approximately 800 acre feet of desalinized water from the MPWP to recharge its groundwater sources. Castroville suffers from salt water intrusion in their wells and have failed to meet water demands in recent years. A first quarter newsletter came out on April 29, 2016, which states that the MPWP will have a one-year delay on the environmental review process.
