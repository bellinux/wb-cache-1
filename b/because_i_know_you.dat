We can get over this... What do you mean... it's been going on for months? We can get over it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> don't love him... What, you love this guy? It's someone we know? Someone in the pub...?", and said that Alfie needs to know who it is for his own peace of mind, though [...] "his whole life just crumbles in his hands". Richie said that viewers would be surprised by the final reveal, stating that [...] "it's really interesting about how we play the Branning card as to which one of them it is. The way it's worded, you believe it's one brother in particular and then that all changes and you go, 'oh it's him!' Because we make people believe it's another Branning—the way its worded, the way I face up to one of them. The audience will all think it's one person in particular, but then I throw a curve ball and it all kicks off. It's great." [...] Richie said that Alfie cannot understand why Kat is having an affair with Derek, which [...] "makes him sick". He also stated that viewers would find out in January 2013 why Kat had the affair with the person she did. He said: [...] "It's an ongoing story, which is really interesting, to see why Kat was with Alfie and why she went for this bloke because they both offer her different things." [...] Richie speculated that the reason Kat had an affair with Derek is [...] "because Derek is the total polar opposite of Alfie" [...] and Kat is [...] "attracted to danger", which is not like Alfie, and Kat is [...] "used to danger, she's used to excitement. What she got from Alfie was the fairytale, what she wanted was the nightmare". However, the reasons for Kat having the affair were never explained on screen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh--yes!" [...] and Miss Dunstable {{stopped in}} the grand path. [...] "I won't let you return with me, Mr Moffat, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> were not coming in so soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't like that," [...] Sadie answered, smiling uncertainly. [...] "But I guess I {{know what}} you mean. I'll wait, dear, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> {{are going to make}} good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then," [...] Babbie said, hiding her face, [...] "I {{could not}} tell you what <b>I</b> was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> would loathe me. I could only go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I {{came to you}} as soon as I {{heard of}} it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> were all alone. If there had been any one else I should not have come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And then I couldn't {{tell anybody}} afterwards. I always meant to tell you,--from the very first; <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> {{would be good}} to me. They are my own. Surely I might do what I liked with my own?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she replied, [...] "you can't {{because we}} are all having tea together: I had some fruits put up, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> don't trifle with tea—and your father's coming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I do. The reason I asked was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> {{started out}} with the {{intention}} of setting fire to the schooner, or destroying her in some way," [...] returned Mr. Henshaw.|$|E
6000|$|She hesitated; {{the tears}} fell down upon her hands behind her veil; {{she no longer}} wiped them. [...] "It's because I've often--heard you; <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> will tell me what's true and right--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Silence, eavesdropper!' cried Catherine; 'none of your {{insolence}} before me! Edgar Linton came {{yesterday by}} chance, Hindley; {{and it was}} I who told him to be off: <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> {{would not like to}} have met him as you were.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But Cecily did {{not seem}} to notice it. [...] "Perhaps I was excited that night, perhaps <b>I</b> was bolder <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> were near me; but I went up to him and touched him! And then, Dick!--oh, Dick! think how awful--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How exquisitely you put it! Who {{else could}} have told me to mind my own {{business}} so delightfully? Well, it isn't my business. I acknowledge that, and <b>I</b> spoke only <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> would be sorry if you had gone too far. I remembered our promise to be friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very good}} of you to come," [...] she said; [...] "very good indeed. You won't find it dull, I hope, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are {{thinking}} about the same thing as these children." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's about archery," [...] he said, [...] "and I don't mind telling you, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> {{will not}} go about telling {{everybody}} else, and also because I {{want to see you}} succeed as an archer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose we admit that's possible?" [...] said Allott, with {{a meaning}} smile. [...] "I imagine, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> both, {{that if you}} were firm enough, you could, so to speak, carry her away. Since you own that she's charming, why don't you try?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Miss Thorne, look here!" [...] {{said she}} {{as soon as}} she found herself in the drawing-room; [...] "do look at my roque-laure. It's clean spoilt, and forever. I wouldn't but wear it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> wished us all to be grand to-day, and yet I had my misgivings. Oh dear, oh dear! It was five-and-twenty shillings a yard." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{turning to}} Claude, he said, 'But I have not {{told you what}} brought me here; I came to persuade you to make an {{expedition}} with me up the Rhine; I set off next week; I would not write about it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> would only say you should like it very much, but-- some but, that meant {{it was a great}} deal too much trouble.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{want you}} to catch me; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{it would be a}} shock. But I tell you what, you never would have caught me if I hadn't come here myself, to see they didn't ill treat you and to make sure {{everything}} was as comfortable as it could be." [...] There was even a sort of break in his voice as he added, [...] "I got those cigars <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> liked them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can {{you ask me}} the question! I know it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you.</b> Your silence, dearest, {{has never}} lowered you in the {{estimation}} of your true friends. The disappearance of your precious birthday gift may seem strange; your unexplained connection with that event may seem stranger still." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't {{mean for}} the time being; I mean {{generally}} speaking. I mean that I care for you <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> {{know a great deal}} more than I do, and because I respect you. I know that everybody expects you to be something great, and I do, too." ...|$|E
60|$|Tow. You're {{interested}} in all, and therefore partial: I have considered on it, {{and will not}} plead, <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> {{have no right to}} judge me; For the last treaty betwixt our king and you Expressly said, that causes criminal Were first to be examined, and then judged, Not here, but by the Council of Defence; To whom I make appeal.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{good of you}} to come. I {{should not}} have dared go to your house, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> feel so deeply. You--you heard?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't grumbled, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> lads {{had about}} {{all you could}} stagger under," [...] he said when we told him that Captain Hanaford was bent on {{trying to get him}} aboard the pungy. [...] "I can't stay in this place very much longer, without taking big chances of going under, for the wound needs careful attention; but if I can be with Bob Hanaford {{everything}} will come around shipshape, because he knows by experience what a gunshot hurt is like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear fellow," [...] Guy said, {{holding the}} thin and fevered hand very tenderly in his, [...] "don't {{talk to me}} like that. I feel to you every bit as you feel to me in this matter. I was afraid of <b>you</b> at first, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> {{misunderstood}} me. But the more I've seen of you, the better we've each of us learned to sympathize with the other. We've long been friends. I love you now, as you say, like a brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you are so}} determined; sir," [...] {{said the}} smith, [...] "I cannot help myself save by force, which I were unwilling to use towards you, Master Tressilian; not that I fear your weapon, but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> to be a worthy, kind, and well-accomplished gentleman, who would rather help than harm a poor man that is in a strait." ...|$|E
60|$|The others {{resumed their}} proper shapes and {{continued}} their journey, but the princess was so silent that {{at last the}} prince asked her what was the matter. 'It is <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> will soon forget all about me,' said she, and though he laughed at her and {{told her it was}} impossible, she did not cease to believe it.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't understand," [...] cried Peter hurriedly. [...] "What I {{want to know}} is, {{why should}} Cresty the Flycatcher ask me to please let him know if I found any cast-off suits of the Snake family? He flew away before I could ask him why he wants them, and so I came to you, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> know everything, {{especially}} everything concerning your neighbors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I'd {{wait for}} <b>you,</b> teacher, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> {{were going to}} the graveyard," [...] he said, {{slipping}} his hand into hers. [...] "I'm going there, too [...] . I'm taking this bouquet of geraniums to put on Grandpa Irving's grave for grandma. And look, teacher, I'm going to put this bunch of white roses beside Grandpa's grave in memory of my little mother. [...] . <b>because</b> <b>I</b> can't go to her grave to put it there. But don't <b>you</b> think she'll <b>know</b> all about it, just the same?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a dunce at many things," [...] she replied. [...] "The reason <b>I</b> came was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>you</b> {{were living}} in these parts, and I had a fancy to see you again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] she said, [...] "I did {{you once}} a very grievous wrong. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> have not forgiven me. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> am very {{sure that all}} the good that was in you lies slain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Copperfield,' said Traddles, {{leaning back}} in his chair when they were gone, and looking at me with an affection that made his eyes red, and his hair all kinds of shapes, 'I don't make any excuse for troubling you with business, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are deeply {{interested}} in it, and it may divert your thoughts. My dear boy, I hope you are not worn out?' ...|$|E
6000|$|With {{a glance}} and gesture of real affection, Phil laid his hand upon his comrade's knee, saying in his persuasive voice, [...] "Old fellow, {{it will do}} you good, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> often long to speak of {{something}} that weighs upon you. You've kept us steady many a time, and done us no end of kindnesses; why be too proud to let us give our sympathy in return, if nothing more?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'As thick,' {{repeated}} Mr Rugg, 'as {{we could}} reasonably have expected. Quite a shower-bath of 'em. I don't often intrude upon you now, when I look round, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are not inclined for company, {{and that if}} you wished to see me, you would leave word in the Lodge. But I am here pretty well every day, sir. Would this be an unseasonable time, sir,' asked Mr Rugg, coaxingly, 'for me to offer an observation?' ...|$|E
60|$|VIOLET. [flushing with indignation] Oh! You think me {{a wicked}} woman, like the rest. You think I {{have not only}} been vile, but that I share your abominable opinions. Miss Ramsden: I have borne your hard words <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> would be sorry for them {{when you found out}} the truth. But I won't bear such a horrible insult as to be complimented by Jack on being one of the wretches of whom he approves. I have kept my {{marriage}} a secret for my husband's sake. But now I claim my right as a married woman not to be insulted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Long ago, in {{my great}} trouble, Faith {{told me that}} for every human effort or affliction there were two {{friendly}} helpers, Time and Death. The first has taught me more gently than I deserved; has made me humble, and given me hope that through my errors I may draw virtue from repentance. But while I have been learning the lessons time can teach, that other helper has told me {{to be ready for}} its coming. Geoffrey, I sent for <b>you</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> would love to see me again before we must say the long good by." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{said that}} before," [...] he replied. [...] "I agree with you. I'm not going on my judgment--but on yours and Gerald's, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> wouldn't {{put up with}} {{anything}} that wasn't strictly all-wool orthodox." ...|$|R
