5|$|Armstrong was {{announced}} {{as the head}} coach of his former junior team, the Toronto Marlboros, in July 1972. Though he had preferred his previous role as a scout to coaching, Armstrong led the Marlboros to Memorial Cup victories on two occasions: in 1973 and 1975.

When approached <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>organization</b> {{with the prospect of}} assuming head coaching duties however, Armstrong rejected the possibility. His decision resulted in animosity from within the organization and subsequently led to his resignation as coach of the Marlboros that season to accept a scouting post with the Quebec Nordiques.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{a victory}} over the Buffalo Sabres after Christmas, and with the team still mired in 14th place in the Western Conference, General Manager and Executive Vice President Darryl Sutter {{announced}} his resignation from both positions on December 28, exactly eight years after {{he was hired by}} the team to become its coach in 2002. The move was not entirely Sutter's decision, as he was asked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>organization</b> to step aside. The decision came as a shock to many fans, even as it was believed to be inevitable following the team's decline in recent seasons. Jay Feaster assumed control of the team, serving as acting general manager.|$|E

5|$|Judging <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>organization</b> {{of other}} {{paramount}} chiefdoms like Coosa and Cofitachequi, Hudson argues that Ocute's power may have extended beyond the core Oconee province.

Ocute and Ichisi were both located on tributaries of the Altamaha River, home to the Guale, and alliances to the north and south would have given Ocute relative parity with their enemies, Cofitachequi. Hudson also entertains the possibility that Toa, perhaps on the Flint River, was included.|$|E

Banister learned to use quantitative data to inform his decisions on when the Pirates should employ defensive shifts in the field.
