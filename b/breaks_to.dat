5|$|The series did {{encounter}} further {{legal problems}} when some {{references to the}} fictional businessman Alan Roe were removed because of a perceived similarity to Sir John Hall, a Newcastle businessman who {{had a number of}} factors in common.

5|$|Amado Boudou, {{who served}} as {{minister}} of economy during Kirchner's first term and vice president during the second, was suspected of corruption in 2012 case. The Ciccone Calcografica printing company filed for bankruptcy in 2010, but this request was cancelled when businessman Alejandro Vandenbroele bought it. The company received tax <b>breaks</b> <b>to</b> pay its debts, and was selected to print banknotes of the Argentine peso. It is suspected that Vandenbroele is actually a frontman for Boudou, and that he employed his clout as minister of economy to benefit a company that actually belonged to him.|$|E

40|$|This article {{introduces}} and {{explores the}} construct of pro-social rule breaking. Pro-social rule breaking is rooted in a desire to promote {{the welfare of the}} organization or one of its stakeholders. The first two studies used interview data to identify three primary types of pro-social rule break-ing: rule <b>breaking</b> <b>to</b> perform one’s responsibilities more efficiently, rule <b>breaking</b> <b>to</b> help a sub-ordinate or colleague, and rule <b>breaking</b> <b>to</b> provide good customer service. A third study used a scenario-based laboratory experiment. It found that the likelihood of pro-social rule breaking was positively related to job autonomy, coworker behavior, and risk-taking propensity...|$|R
5|$|In the 1920 season, Jardine {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut, played eight first-class matches and scored two fifties. Playing mainly as an opening batsman, {{he won his}} Blue, appearing in the University Match against Cambridge but fell short of expectations, and continued to be criticised for over-caution with the bat. In all, he scored 217 runs {{at an average of}} 22.64. In the match for Oxford against Essex, he took six wickets for six runs in a bowling spell of 45 balls, bowling leg <b>breaks,</b> <b>to</b> have bowling figures of six for 28. It was the only occasion in his career where he took five or more wickets in an innings.|$|E
5|$|Murphy won two {{qualifying}} matches {{to qualify}} for the 2005 World Championship. He defeated former world champions Higgins 13–8, Davis 13–4, and Peter Ebdon 17–12 to reach the final to face Matthew Stevens, the world number six. He trailed Stevens 6–10 {{at the end of the}} first day (the World Championship final is played over two days), but made a comeback to bring the score to 16–16. He then made two frame-winning <b>breaks</b> <b>to</b> lift the title. His 11 century breaks were the most in that year's tournament.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts are {{volcanic}} mountains which {{rise from}} the seafloor. The unlimited supply of water surrounding these volcanoes can cause them to behave differently from volcanoes on land. The lava emitted in eruptions at Bowie Seamount is made of basalt, a common gray to black or dark brown volcanic rock low in silica content (the lava is mafic). When basaltic lava makes contact with the cold sea water, it may cool very rapidly to form pillow lava, through which the hot lava <b>breaks</b> <b>to</b> form another pillow. Pillow lava is typically fine-grained, due to rapid cooling, with a glassy crust, and has radial jointing.|$|E

5|$|By 1972, Pink Floyd had {{recorded}} the soundtracks to the films The Committee (1968) and More (1969), and to part of Zabriskie Point (1970). On {{the back of}} Mores success, its director Barbet Schroeder asked the band to record the soundtrack of his next major project as and when it arrived. The new film, La Vallée, featured two travellers on a spiritual quest in New Guinea, and Schroeder thought Pink Floyd would be suitable to provide the music. The group had already started working on another album, The Dark Side of the Moon, including some basic recording and live performances, but took two <b>breaks</b> <b>to</b> Strawberry Studios, Château d'Hérouville, France, {{either side of a}} Japanese tour, to write and record music for the film. The album was then mixed from 4–6 April at Morgan Sound Studios in London.|$|E
5|$|Morsell {{found it}} {{challenging}} to film a scene {{near the end}} of the game, in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting strapped into the chair with a guillotine overhead. Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed, and Morsell said it was difficult for her to work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take. The torture devices featured in the game were scale models made by local craftsmen. During one scene, the mansion roof starts to collapse, causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors. To achieve this, the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard, which had to fall in the correct sequence. In another scene, Adrienne crawls along a water pipe that <b>breaks.</b> <b>To</b> film the scene without damaging equipment, the crew built a giant plastic box with a plastic tray underneath for the shoot. Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions.|$|E
5|$|Other {{rationales}} {{for the failure}} of the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis include considering the conditional bias to be an exogenous variable explained by a policy aimed at smoothing interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates, or considering that an economy allowing for discrete changes could facilitate excess returns in the forward market. Some researchers have contested empirical failures of the hypothesis and have sought to explain conflicting evidence as resulting from contaminated data and even inappropriate selections of the time length of forward contracts. Economists demonstrated that the forward rate could serve as a useful proxy for future spot exchange rates between currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset of floating exchange rate regimes in the 1970s. Research examining the introduction of endogenous <b>breaks</b> <b>to</b> test the structural stability of cointegrated spot and forward exchange rate time series have found some evidence to support forward rate unbiasedness in both the short and long term.|$|E

5|$|After the new ball bowlers had {{finished}} their new ball spells, Bradman reverted to the slower bowlers, using run-saving, defensive field settings. Immediately thereafter, Bedser targeted Toshack and hit three consecutive fours and a two in one over. Bradman immediately removed the left-armer and replaced him with Johnson. The Australian captain set his infield rather deep, effectively allowing the batsmen to take easy singles. Bedser responded cautiously, surveying Johnson's off spin for one over, {{before going on}} the attack in the next. He lofted Johnson into the leg side three times, yielding a six over long on and two fours, taking his score to 47. Bedser then hit a ball back to the bowler Loxton, which was almost caught, before reaching 50. Bradman also brought back a tired Miller to bowl medium pace off <b>breaks,</b> <b>to</b> no avail. England went to the lunch adjournment at 360/2, with Edrich on 76 and Bedser on 52. They had added 92 for the session, including 70 in the second hour. Lindwall {{had been the only}} bowler who caused much difficulty to the batsmen, particularly concerning Edrich, but the Englishmen dealt with his colleagues comfortably and Miller, nursing fitness concerns, was forced to bowl medium-paced off breaks.|$|E
