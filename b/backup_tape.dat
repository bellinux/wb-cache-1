5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: Theft of Ohio {{government}} computer <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Transportation is {{concerned}} almost entirely with throughput, {{which is why}} physical deliveries of <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> archives are still largely done by vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The legal hold is {{initiated}} by a {{notice or communication}} from legal counsel to an organization that suspends the normal disposition or processing of records, such as <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> recycling, archived media and other storage and management of documents and information. A legal hold will be issued {{as a result of}} current or anticipated litigation, audit, government investigation or other such matter to avoid evidence spoliation. Legal holds can encompass business procedures affecting active data, including <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> recycling.|$|E
50|$|The {{defendant}} {{was ordered to}} produce, at its own expense, all responsive email existing on its optical disks, servers, and five <b>backup</b> <b>tapes</b> as selected by the plaintiff. The court would only conduct a cost-shifting analysis after {{the review of the}} contents of the <b>backup</b> <b>tapes.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the {{restoration}} effort, {{as described in}} the court's prior opinions (see Zubulake I and III), the parties learned that some <b>backup</b> <b>tapes</b> were no longer available. The parties also concluded that relevant emails created after the initial proceedings had been deleted from UBS's email system and were only accessible on <b>backup</b> <b>tapes.</b> The plaintiff then sought an order requiring UBS to pay for the total costs of restoring the remaining <b>backup</b> <b>tapes.</b> In addition, Laura Zubulake sought an adverse inference instruction against UBS and the costs for re-deposing some individuals due to the destruction of evidence.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Backup</b> <b>tapes</b> {{involves}} saving data to tape-recorder type of {{device and}} can {{hold up to}} many gigabytes of information. It {{is not possible to}} retrieve individual documents because <b>backup</b> <b>tapes</b> contain data which is recorded to mirror of each computer's structure. They also often involve compression of data. For these reasons, restoration of tapes and access to data is slow and costly.|$|R
5000|$|A later {{version of}} tape backup for the Corvus Omninet was called [...] "The Bank" [...] {{and was a}} {{standalone}} Omninet connected device that used custom <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> media that were very similar in shape and size to today's DLT tapes.|$|E
50|$|The {{theft of}} an Ohio {{government}} computer <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> in June 2007 was widely {{reported in the}} media after authorities revealed that the tape contained names and Social Security numbers of 64,000 state employees, 84,000 welfare recipients, {{and tens of thousands}} of others. In the wake of the theft, Strickland issued an executive order to change the practices for handling state data.|$|E
50|$|According to the decision, UBS e-mails were {{automatically}} {{backed up}} on tapes and optical disks. Optical disks contained only the internal emails of registered traders. To restore a <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> would take UBS approximately five days, although such restoration could be faster if using services {{available in the}} private sector for a higher price. Ninety-four backup tapes were identified as containing information relevant to Zubulake’s request.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ability for}} the {{disclosing}} party {{to shift the}} costs to the requesting party of recovering inaccessible media (<b>backup</b> <b>tapes,</b> for example); ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the context}} of a gender {{discrimination}} and retaliation lawsuit, the plaintiff Laura Zubulake moved to obtain from defendants UBS Warburg LLC, UBS Warburg and UBS AG ('UBS') “all documents concerning any communication by or between UBS employees concerning the Plaintiff.” UBS responded by providing several documents, including e-mail records totaling 100 pages, but did not search its <b>backup</b> <b>tapes</b> or other archives for responsive e-mails. The Plaintiff requested emails from UBS' optical disks, servers and <b>backup</b> <b>tapes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Court {{ordered that}} the defendants: [...] "produce all {{responsive}} e-mails that exist on its optical disks or on its active servers (i.e., in HP OpenMail files) {{at its own}} expense. UBS is also ordered to produce, at its expense, responsive emails from any five <b>backups</b> <b>tapes</b> selected by Zubulake. UBS should then prepare an affidavit detailing the results of its search, {{as well as the}} time and money spent. After reviewing the contents of the <b>backup</b> <b>tapes</b> and UBS's certification, the Court will conduct the appropriate cost-shifting analysis.” ...|$|R
5000|$|.....all data {{in storage}} but {{excludes}} any data that frequently traverses the network or that which resides in temporary memory. Data at rest includes {{but is not}} limited to archived data, data which is not accessed or changed frequently, files stored on hard drives, USB thumb drives, files stored on <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> and disks, and also files stored off-site or on a storage area network (SAN)." ...|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, [...] {{the highest}} {{capacity}} <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> format available is LTO-7, with {{a capacity of}} 6 TB. If a tape of this capacity were sent by overnight mail and were to arrive around 20 hours after it was sent, the effective data rate would be 664 Mbit/s. With networking technology, this magnitude of speed over this distance {{would be very difficult}} to attain without a costly dedicated connection as one would likely need to use several hops and have a connection that is not oversubscribed.|$|E
5000|$|When {{used with}} tape drives, Backup Exec uses the Microsoft Tape Format (MTF), {{which is also}} used by Windows NTBackup, backup {{utilities}} included in Microsoft SQL Server, and many other backup vendors and is compatible with BKF. Microsoft Tape Format (MTF) [...] was originally Maynard's (Backup Exec's first authors) proprietary <b>backup</b> <b>Tape</b> Format (MTF) and was later licensed by Microsoft as Windows standard tape format. In addition, Microsoft also licensed and incorporated Backup Exec's backup engine into Windows NT, the server version of Windows.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes it isn't {{possible}} to locate {{all the data}} in the old format, for example, because some of it only exists on <b>backup</b> <b>tapes</b> or saved on users' memory cards.|$|R
50|$|SME Server {{software}} supports both {{hardware and}} software disk mirroring (RAID 1), USB Disk <b>backup</b> & <b>tape</b> <b>backup</b> for additional data protection.|$|R
50|$|Citing Rule 34, the Court in Zubulake I {{stated that}} {{electronic}} documents can equally {{be the subject}} of discovery as paper documents. Furthermore, this is equally valid for digital data on <b>backup</b> <b>tapes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{connection}} with mainly western home computers of the 1980s came mainly for data <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> recorders and floppy drives also, {{in a professional}} environment with the personal computers increasingly hard - and removable disk drives used. The cheapest version of the data recording by compact cassette has the disadvantage of low data transfer rates and so long loading times, whereas the much faster and more reliable disks and disk drives were much more expensive to purchase, {{or in the case}} of the GDR were hardly available. Upon publication of the Z 1013 for data recording were merely tape recorder and tape systems available. Ports for connecting disk drives did not come until the reunification period on.|$|E
5000|$|Here you are, {{the night}} before the battle, {{and you are going to}} die of thirst. Pulling one of your most prized {{possessions}} from your vest - a <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> with the quantum matrix for both Mountain Dew and Jolt Cola - it isn't long before you get the replicator making something useful. With a fresh ANSI standard code-pie (minus one slice) and something decent to drink, you crank the sound system. A smirk crosses your face when you realize what you are wearing. It was an old promotional T-shirt that says [...] "CodeWarrior: Blood, Sweat, and CODE" [...] How ironic. The enemy will attack at dawn (don't they always?) and you must be ready.|$|E
50|$|The group's self-titled {{debut album}} was {{recorded}} in 1978 at Sound 80 and was ostensibly {{going to be a}} direct to disc recording. Nevertheless, 3M placed an experimental 50.4 kHz digital recorder in the control room as a backup to the direct-to-disc lathe. The band was required to play the entire LP side without stopping and without any editing afterward. When the resulting acetate disc was deemed inferior to the digital master tape, the record was pressed from that digital <b>backup</b> <b>tape,</b> making it the second-ever U.S. commercially available digital recording. Since the machine used was an early experimental prototype, built before any digital recording standards were established, and dismantled before 1979, there is currently no way to reissue that first album on either LP or CD.|$|E
50|$|A tape {{management}} system (TMS) is computer software that manages the usage {{and retention of}} computer <b>backup</b> <b>tapes.</b> This may be done as a stand-alone function {{or as part of}} a broader backup software package.|$|R
5000|$|On December 14, 2009, CNN {{reported}} that all 22 million missing emails {{had been found}} on <b>backup</b> <b>tapes,</b> and that the Obama Administration reached a settlement with two watchdog groups who had sued to obtain the emails.|$|R
50|$|Returning home {{he shares}} a smoke with his dog as he contemplates {{what to do}} next. Just in case things turn south, he tells his dog {{to clean out the}} bio {{fabricator}} and prepare the <b>backup</b> <b>tapes</b> to re-create his wife if necessary.|$|R
5000|$|On Breeders' Cup Day, Harn {{slipped into}} his office at Autotote. To {{make sure he was}} covered, he {{remotely}} ejected the <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> at Catskill before the first race. He then took several calls from Davis while the races were underway. After the fourth race, and half an hour before the Turf, Harn hacked onto the system and tracked down Davis' bet. He then changed Davis' original bet to reflect the actual four winners. After having the Catskill techs reinsert the tape, he bet on every horse running in the Turf and Classic, assuring that he would win. [...] The plan worked, {{and they were able to}} turn their original $1,152 bet into almost $3.1 million in winnings--$2.57 million for winning the Pick 6, plus $498,000 in consolation prizes for picking five out of six winners.|$|E
40|$|A Turing {{machine with}} faults, {{failures}} and recovery (TMF) is described. TMF is (weakly) non-deterministic Turing machine consisting of five semi-infinite tapes (Master Tape, Synchro Tape, <b>Backup</b> <b>Tape,</b> Backup Synchro Tape, User Tape) and four controlling components (Program, Daemon, Apparatus, User). Computational process {{consists of three}} phases (Program Phase, Failure Phase, Repair Phase). C++ Simulator of a Turing machine with faults, failures and recovery has been developed. Comment: 8 pages; C++ Simulator has been develope...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} system which enables a user to remove a file from both the file system and all the backup tapes on which the file is stored. The ability to remove files from all backup tapes is {{desirable}} in many cases. Our system erases information from the <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> without actually writing on the tape. This is achieved by applying cryptography in a new way: a block cipher is used to enable the system to "forget" information rather than protect it. Our system is easy to install and is transparent to the end user. Further, it introduces no slowdown in system performance and little slowdown in the backup procedure...|$|E
50|$|Getting rid of old <b>backup</b> <b>tapes,</b> {{data stored}} in the cloud, computers, phones, {{multi-function}} printers can be challenging when confidentiality of information is an issue. When encryption is in place, it will enable a smooth disposal of data.Confidentiality and privacy are big drivers of encryption.|$|R
25|$|On 4 October 2004, Wintersun {{announced}} {{the departure of}} Oliver Fokin as guitarist, and a suitable replacement would not be found until 27 December when Teemu Mäntysaari joined. The search for a keyboardist continued, and Wintersun was forced to use <b>backup</b> <b>tapes</b> for their future performances.|$|R
50|$|August 28-31, 1977: Soundstream's PCM system {{runs in the}} {{background}} of a California direct to disc recording session by organist Virgil Fox for Crystal Records. When initially released the resulting LPs were pressed from the direct-to-disc acetate, though the later CD reissue (1987) comes from the digital <b>backup</b> <b>tapes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Recovering evidential {{data from}} {{magnetic}} tapes in a forensically sound manner {{is a difficult}} task. There are many different tape technologies in existence today and an even greater number of archive formats used. This paper discusses the issues and challenges involved in the forensic acquisition and analysis of magnetic tapes. It identifies areas of slack space on tapes and discusses the challenges of low level acquisition of an entire length of tape. It suggests a basic methodology for determining {{the contents of a}} tape, acquiring tape files, and preparing them for forensic analysis. Keywords: Digital Forensics, Tape Forensics, Backup Forensics, <b>Backup</b> <b>tape</b> acquisition, Magnetic tape acquisition. Please note that ”tape files ” in this paper refers to SCSI tape files defined by the SCSI Stream Commands (SSC- 3) standard. It does NOT refer to files contained within backup archives created by various backup programs (ARCserve, NTBackup, ufsdump, etc). ...|$|E
40|$|The High Density Digital Data Storage System was {{designed}} to provide a cost effective means for storing real-time data from the field-deployable digital acoustic measurement system. However, the high density data storage system is a standalone system that could provide a storage solution for many other real time data acquisition applications. The storage system has inputs for up to 20 channels of 16 -bit digital data. The high density tape recorders presently being used in the storage system are capable of storing over 5 gigabytes of data at overall transfer rates of 500 kilobytes per second. However, through the use of data compression techniques the system storage capacity and transfer rate can be doubled. Two tape recorders have been incorporated into the storage system to produce a <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> of data in real-time. An analog output is provided for each data channel as a means of monitoring the data as it is being recorded...|$|E
40|$|Consider {{the task}} of {{asymmetric}} key-wrapping, where a key-management server encrypts a cryptographic key under the public key of a client. When used in storage and access-control systems, it {{is often the case}} that the server has no knowledge about the client (beyond its public key) and no means of coordinating with it. For example, a wrapped key used to encrypt a <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> may be needed many years after wrapping, when the server is no longer available, key-wrapping standards have changed, and even the security requirements of the client might have changed. Hence we need a flexible mechanism that seamlessly supports different options depending on what the original server was using and the current standards and requirements. We show that one-pass HMQV (which we call HOMQV) is a perfect fit for this type of applications in terms of security, efficiency and flexibility. It offers server authentication if the server has its own public key, and degenerates down to the standardized DHIES encryption scheme if the server does not have a public key. The performance difference between the unauthenticated DHIES and the authenticated HOMQV is very minimal (essentially for free for the server and only 1 / 2 exponentiation for the client). We provide a formal analysis of the protocol’s securit...|$|E
50|$|Zubulake V {{issued on}} July 20, 2004, {{involved}} the plaintiff wanting an adverse inference {{to the jury}} based on the defendants delays and incompleteness in providing requested e-mails from <b>backup</b> <b>tapes.</b> Also, the Court found that deleted e-mails prejudiced the plaintiff’s case. The Court examined the issue of destruction of evidence, spoliation and duty of litigation hold.|$|R
50|$|Disk staging {{is using}} disks as an additional, {{temporary}} stage of backup process before finally storing <b>backup</b> to <b>tape.</b> <b>Backups</b> stay on disk typically {{for a day}} or a week, before being copied to tape in a background process and deleted afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|A {{computer}} operator performs routine maintenance and upkeep, such as changing <b>backup</b> <b>tapes</b> or replacing failed drives in a redundant array of independent disks (RAID). Such tasks usually require physical {{presence in the}} room with the computer, and while less skilled than sysadmin tasks, may require a similar level of trust, since the operator has access to possibly sensitive data.|$|R
