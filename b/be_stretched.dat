5|$|The {{challenge}} {{may come}} from working outside in the elements. It could be 50 degrees when we rehearse and 50 below on game day, we're working under the pretext {{that we can be}} doing this in snow or rain... In a normal indoor environment we have seven minutes to install the stage and get it camera ready. That can <b>be</b> <b>stretched</b> to nine minutes. It's the same time frame for this.|$|E
5|$|The skins of {{cephalopods}} {{such as the}} octopus contain complex units, each {{consisting of}} a chromatophore with surrounding muscle and nerve cells. The cephalopod chromatophore has all its pigment grains in a small elastic sac, which can <b>be</b> <b>stretched</b> or allowed to relax {{under the control of}} the brain to vary its opacity. By controlling chromatophores of different colours, cephalopods can rapidly change their skin patterns and colours.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth Castle is an {{artillery}} fort, built to protect Dartmouth harbour in Devon, England. The earliest {{parts of the}} castle date from the 1380s, when, {{in response to the}} threat of a French attack, the civic authorities created a small enclosure castle overlooking the mouth of the Dart estuary. This was intended to engage enemy ships with catapults and possibly early cannon, and incorporated the local chapel of Saint Petroc within its walls. At the end of the 15th century, the castle was expanded with {{an artillery}} tower and an iron chain which could <b>be</b> <b>stretched</b> across the harbour to a tower at Godmerock; this addition formed the oldest known purpose-built coast artillery fort in Britain. Further gun batteries were added during the French invasion scare of the 1540s.|$|E

5|$|Farther inland, as Janet {{dissipated}} {{over the}} mountainous central Mexico, the storm dropped torrential rainfall over the Tamisi and Panuco River basins. The water {{levels in the}} Panuco River remained above flood stage for four weeks. In Tampico, the river flooded neighborhoods, forcing cables to <b>be</b> <b>stretched</b> along roads to prevent people from being swept away. Small boats were also sent to monitor streets. According to some sources, 800people died from the floods, with thousands more being stranded in the city. Tamazunchale was inundated by an overflowing Moctezuma River. The rains caused a landslide in Colonia San Rafael, killing 12people. Heavy rains also impacted Guadalajara, which had previously not been affected by any tropical cyclones earlier in the year. In Maltarana, Jalisco, the Lerma and Duero Rivers overflowed, forcing 800people in the town to evacuate. Farther north, in Sonora, cotton crops damaged by Janet were estimated to amount to $12million in damages. Combined property damage in Mexico from Hurricanes Gladys, Hilda, and Janet was estimated to total $200million, {{nearly half of the}} government's 1955national budget. Although there were no official damage or fatality estimates, at least 1,000people were injured and another 100,000people were made homeless on the Mexican mainland due to Janet.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after stylists penned {{the first}} design sketches, Holden {{engineers}} {{began work on}} developing the chassis. Opel, which had {{provided the basis for}} all previous Commodore generations, ceased production of their rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. This meant that Holden had two options: to use another GM platform, or to develop an all-new vehicle. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform was to see production in the 2002 Cadillac CTS. Holden's engineers were offered this platform, but decided it was not appropriate. The Sigma platform's double A-arm front suspension and extensive use of aluminium were too costly for the VE's market segment. The luggage compartment was deemed too small and the Sigma interior package could not <b>be</b> <b>stretched</b> sufficiently to become a family-sized car. In particular, the rear-seat shoulder width was too tight. These major drawbacks made Holden decide to develop an all-new platform, known as the GM Zeta platform, on which a number of forthcoming GM vehicles will also be based. The Zeta suspension system comprises new double-pivot MacPherson strut for the front and a four-link independent rear setup. These replace the previous simple MacPherson strut design front and much criticised semi-trailing arm rear suspension, for improved ride and handling.|$|E

25|$|Ductility is a material's {{ability to}} deform under tensile stress. This is often {{characterized}} by the material's ability to <b>be</b> <b>stretched</b> into a wire. Ductility is especially important in metalworking because materials that crack or break under stress cannot be hammered, rolled, or drawn (drawing {{is a process that}} uses tensile forces to stretch metal).|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1970 Christo and Jeanne-Claude {{began their}} {{preparations}} for the Valley Curtain project. A 400-meter-long cloth was to <b>be</b> <b>stretched</b> across Rifle Gap, a valley in the Rocky Mountains near Rifle, Colorado. The project required 14,000 m2 of cloth to be hung on four steel cables, fastened with iron bars fixed in concrete on each slope, and 200 tons of concrete.|$|E
25|$|A pulse can <b>be</b> <b>stretched</b> {{simply by}} letting it {{propagate}} through a thick slab of transparent material, such as 200mm glass. As with the prisms, {{only a limited}} amount of dispersion can be achieved within physically practical dimensions. Outside the visible-light spectrum, materials exist both for positive and negative dispersion. For visible and near-infrared wavelengths, almost all transparent materials have positive dispersion. However, glass fibres can have their dispersion tailored to meet the needs.|$|E

25|$|IFs {{are rather}} {{deformable}} proteins that can <b>be</b> <b>stretched</b> several times their initial length. The key to facilitate this large deformation {{is due to}} their hierarchical structure, which facilitates a cascaded activation of deformation mechanisms {{at different levels of}} strain. Initially the coupled alpha-helices of unit-length filaments uncoil as they're strained, then as the strain increases they transition into beta-sheets, and finally at increased strain the hydrogen bonds between beta-sheets slip and the ULF monomers slide along each other.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year, Dr. Julian W. Hill, {{another member of}} the Carothers team, began work again on {{attempting}} to produce a polyester with a molecular weight of above 4,000. His efforts were soon met with great success when he produced a synthetic polymer with a molecular weight of about 12,000. The high molecular weight allowed the melted polymer to <b>be</b> <b>stretched</b> out into strings of fiber. Thus was created the first synthetic silk, described by the chemists as a superpolyester.|$|E
25|$|One of its {{technical}} drawbacks is {{a limited}} texture cache, which can hold textures of limited dimensions and reduced color depth, which must <b>be</b> <b>stretched</b> to cover larger in-game surfaces. Its vintage ROM cartridges are constrained by small capacity and high production expenses, compared to the compact disc format used by its chief competitors. Some third-party publishers that supported Nintendo's previous consoles reduced their output or stopped publishing for the console; the Nintendo 64's most successful games came from first-party or second-party studios.|$|E

25|$|The {{scrapping}} of B-36s {{began in}} February 1956. Once replaced by B-52s, they were flown directly from operational squadrons to Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, where the Mar-Pak Corporation handled their reclamation and destruction. Defense cutbacks in FY 1958 compelled the B-52 procurement process to <b>be</b> <b>stretched</b> {{out and the}} B-36 service life to be extended. The B-36s remaining in service were supported with components scavenged from aircraft sent to Davis-Monthan. Further update work was undertaken by Convair at San Diego (Specialized Aircraft Maintenance, SAM-SAC) until 1957 to extend the life and capabilities of the B-36s. By December 1958 only 22 B-36Js were still operational.|$|E
25|$|In {{materials}} science, {{and especially}} elasticity theory, ideas of torsion also {{play an important}} role. One problem models the growth of vines, focusing {{on the question of}} how vines manage to twist around objects. The vine itself is modeled as a pair of elastic filaments twisted around one another. In its energy-minimizing state, the vine naturally grows {{in the shape of a}} helix. But the vine may also <b>be</b> <b>stretched</b> out to maximize its extent (or length). In this case, the torsion of the vine is related to the torsion of the pair of filaments (or equivalently the surface torsion of the ribbon connecting the filaments), and it reflects the difference between the length-maximizing (geodesic) configuration of the vine and its energy-minimizing configuration.|$|E
