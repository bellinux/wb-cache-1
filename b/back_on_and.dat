5|$|I went to Iraq {{because what}} I saw when I {{was over there}} was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these {{young men and women}} who are over there fighting to help this country.|$|E
5|$|Chris pays a visit {{during his}} nightly jog, and Ann leaves with him {{so they can}} clear the air. Over dinner, Chris once again acts so optimistic while {{discussing}} the break-up that Ann thinks their relationship is <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> tries to kiss him, severely embarrassing her. Meanwhile, the camping trip proves unsuccessful and everybody decides to go home that night, but they are left without transportation because Tom and Ben have hooked all of their electronics to the van's battery, draining it. Everybody hikes to a strange bed and breakfast filled with cats and dolls called The Quiet Corn, run by a strict old lady named Elsa Clack (Annie O'Donnell). Andy arrives and rebuilds the romantic tent in the yard for a flattered April. Leslie tells Ron about her mental block, worrying she will never again reproduce an idea better than harvest festival. Ron, recognizing how burnt out she is, solves Leslie's problem by locking her in a bedroom and ordering her to get some sleep. With a rare full night's sleep energizing her, Leslie wakes up with numerous big ideas that are well received by Chris.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} as Notts County manager in May 1957, controversially replacing caretaker-manager Frank Broome. Broome, who had steered the club {{away from being}} relegated from the Second Division, was installed as his assistant manager. He found it tedious in making new signings due to financial constraints {{on the part of}} the club. He did though take on forwards Jeff Astle and Tony Hateley as apprentices, who would both go on to have long careers in the First Division. Lawton agreed to go without his wages for six months so as to improve the club's finances. County were though relegated at the end of the 1957–58 season, finishing one point short of safety, and Lawton was sacked. He received a total of just three months pay for his time at the club, having only a verbal offer of a three-year contract to fall <b>back</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> nothing in writing.|$|E

5|$|To the Allies, the Belgian {{failure to}} hold onto its eastern frontiers (they {{were thought to be}} capable of holding out for two weeks), was a disappointment. The Allied Chiefs of Staff had sought to avoid an {{encounter}} mobile battle without any strong fixed defences to fall <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> hoped Belgian resistance would last long enough for a defensive line to be established. Nevertheless, a brief lull fell on the Dyle front on 11 May which enabled the Allied armies to get into position by the time the first major assault was launched the following day. Allied cavalry had moved into position and infantry and artillery were reaching the front more slowly, by rail. Although unaware of it, the First Allied army Group and the Belgian Army outnumbered and outgunned Walther von Reichenau's German 6th Army.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} {{the end of}} the second queue, guests were loaded into test cars. Upon dispatching from the loading dock, the car was brought through an accelerated hill climb. Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's anti-lock braking system was turned off and the car tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process. The anti-lock brakes were then turned <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference. Then, the cars were brought through 3 environmental chambers: a heat chamber, a cold chamber, and a corrosion chamber.|$|E
5|$|Wallace had {{financial}} difficulties {{throughout much of}} his life. His Amazon and Far Eastern trips were supported by the sale of specimens he collected and, after he lost most of the considerable money he made from those sales in unsuccessful investments, he had to support himself mostly from the publications he produced. Unlike some of his contemporaries in the British scientific community, such as Darwin and Charles Lyell, he had no family wealth to fall <b>back</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> he was unsuccessful in finding a long-term salaried position, receiving no regular income until he was awarded a small government pension, through Darwin's efforts, in 1881.|$|E

25|$|Els {{has often}} been {{compared}} to Greg Norman {{in the sense that}} both men’s careers could be looked <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> think what could have been. Although the two of them are multiple major championship winners they have both shared disappointment in majors. Their disappointments have ranged from nerves, bad luck and simply being outplayed. 1996 was the year where Norman collapsed in the Masters, whereas the year before Els did in the PGA Championship. Els has finished runner-up in six majors. He has finished runner-up to Tiger Woods more than any other golfer and {{has often been}} described as having the right game to finally be the golfer to beat Woods in a major.|$|E
25|$|Then Geraint Jones smacked two fours off Hussey {{to end the}} over, {{meaning that}} England needed 39 off 36 balls. Five balls later, a miscued sweep off Hogg hit Geraint Jones on the pads – gone for 71 – and England only had three wickets to spare. Two more balls were {{delivered}} before that tally was cut down to two – Hussey bowled Simon Jones for a two-ball one, so with Gough and Giles in, England needed 35 off 29 balls. Despite taking the runs off Hussey, Brett Lee's 47th over only yielded a single, as his variations of length {{turned out to be}} just the thing. However, Ponting now needed another over from either Hussey, Hogg or Symonds – deciding to use Hussey, he was punished, as Giles hit twos to both the off and leg side, and a wide from Hussey resulting in a nine-run over. Lee then came <b>back</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> with his short ball had Giles playing a definitely unorthodox stroke – a sliced edge over Gilchrist's head for four.|$|E

She turns it off during the final scene of the video, puts the tarp <b>back</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> walks outside of the warehouse.

One of {{the patients}} lost [...] "three-fourths of an ounce" [...] (21.3 grams) in weight, coinciding with the time of death. MacDougall disregarded the results of another patient on the grounds the scales were [...] "not finely adjusted", and discounted the results of another as the patient died while the equipment was still being calibrated. MacDougall reported that none of the dogs lost any weight after death.|$|E

500|$|In a June 2009 {{interview}} with Italy's Rock TV, Ulrich said Metallica {{was planning to}} continue touring until August 2010, {{and that there were}} no plans for a tenth album. He said he was sure the band would collaborate with producer Rick Rubin again. According to Blabbermouth.net, the band was considering recording its next album {{in the second half of}} 2011. In November 2010, during an {{interview with}} The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, [...] "There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we want to get back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> start writing some songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is distraught {{to learn}} that {{although}} her writing staff sometimes hang out after work, they never invite her. She tells Jack—her boss—about this, however, Jack explains that it is best for her to keep her distance from them. Later, Liz's assistant Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden) announces that her wedding is <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> that Liz and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) need to plan a bachelorette party for her. Liz decides to have the party at her apartment and prove to her employees—who are invited—that she can be fun to be with. At the bachelorette party, staff members Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell) and J. D. Lutz (John Lutz) show up, but want to leave as they are not having a good time. Liz gets upset about this, calls them out for not inviting her {{to hang out with}} them and demands that they apologize to her.|$|E
500|$|The chariot races were {{important}} in the Byzantine Empire, as in the Roman Empire, {{as a way to}} reinforce social class and political power, including the might of the Byzantine emperor, and were often put on for political or religious reasons. In addition, chariot races were sometimes held in celebration of an emperor's birthday. An explicit parallel was drawn between the victorious charioteers and the victorious emperor. The factions addressed their victors by chanting [...] "Rejoice... your Lords have conquered" [...] while the charioteer took a victory lap, further indicating the parallel between the charioteer's victory and the emperor's victory. Indeed, reliefs of Porphyrius, the famous Byzantine charioteer, show him in a victor's pose being acclaimed by partisans, which is clearly modeled on the images on the base of Emperor Theodosius's obelisk. The races could also be used to symbolically make religious statements, such as when a charioteer, whose mother was named Mary, fell off his chariot and got <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> the crowd described it as [...] "The son of Mary has fallen and risen again and is victorious." ...|$|E

500|$|On 5March 1917, {{shortly after}} commencing {{operations}} with No.1 Squadron, Williams narrowly avoided crash-landing when his engine stopped {{while he was}} bombing the railway terminus at Tel el Sheria. At first believing {{that he had been}} struck by enemy fire, he found that the engine switch outside his cockpit had turned off. Within 500feet of the ground he was able to switch the engine <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> return to base. On 21April, Williams landed behind enemy lines to rescue downed comrade Lieutenant Adrian Cole, having the day before pressed home an attack on Turkish cavalry whilst under [...] "intense anti-aircraft fire"; these two actions earned him the Distinguished Service Order for [...] "conspicuous gallantry". He was promoted major in May and given command of No.1 Squadron, which was re-equipped with Bristol Fighters later that year. [...] "Now for the first time," [...] wrote Williams, [...] "after 17 months in the field we had aircraft with which we could deal with our enemy in the air." [...] His men knew him as a teetotaller and non-smoker, whose idea of swearing was an occasional [...] "Darn me!".|$|E
500|$|As the storyline developed, it {{held the}} {{potential}} to ruin the positive changes that the character had achieved. Halfpenny said Amy had become really close to Val and Eric. They are in a [...] "good place" [...] and they think [...] "Amy's all happy." [...] The one person she wants to tell is Val, with whom she shares the closest bond and shes [...] "gutted" [...] to remain silent. It prevents them from having a normal parent/child relationship, as the truth would ruin her one last chance. Halfpenny said her portrayal turns Amy to a [...] "dark place" [...] as she is [...] "too young to be coping with something like this." [...] As Amy becomes preoccupied with fear in case Cain finds out, Halfpenny said it makes Amy do [...] "something dangerous." [...] Though, Amy has Victoria to fall <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> is described as [...] "her rock". Emmerdale series producer Stuart Blackburn said the storyline would change {{the lives of a}} lot of people around Amy. At times he said the narrative is [...] "truly heart breaking" [...] and dangerous. [...] "I think it's going to change perceptions of Amy [...] we’re going to start to understand Amy an awful lot more." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} Sophia Peletier {{is a major}} {{incident}} in [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already", largely affecting the themes of the episode. After the group has shot the walkers housed in Hershel Greene's barn, Sophia appears from the barn as a walker, much to the groups' dismay. A disturbed and distraught Rick Grimes pulls out his weapon and makes the decision to shoot her. Despite being initially surprised about her character's being killed off, Madison Lintz concluded that she understood its aftermath for the show. Lintz affirmed that portraying a walker was a welcoming experience for her, and stated that she was [...] "going to look <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> say that was amazing." [...] Robert Kirkman felt that killing Sophia would add more dimension to the show, as well as add more flexibility to its storyline progression. [...] "When a good idea comes up, {{you have to go}} with it," [...] he articulated. [...] "Sophia is a character who is still alive in the comic book series and who has contributed quite a bit to the overall narrative and informed a lot of story lines for a lot of different characters. Having Carol [...] survive her daughter as opposed to the other way around {{as it is in the}} comics is going to lead to interesting but different stories." [...] Although Kirkman was not on set during production of the sequence, Gimple retrieved shell casings from the blanks that were fired on set. Referred to as [...] "Barnageddon" [...] by the writers, Kirkman asserted that he emphasized unpredictability while creating the scene.|$|E
