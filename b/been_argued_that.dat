5|$|After Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} in January 1933, Piłsudski is rumored to have {{proposed}} to France a preventive war against Germany. It has <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Piłsudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany. Lack of French interest may have been a reason why Poland signed the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934. Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal for preventive war was ever actually advanced.|$|E
40|$|It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Husserl <b>was</b> an “externalist” in {{at least}} one sense. For it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Husserl held that {{genuinely}} perceptual experiences—that is to say, experiences that are of some real object in the world—differ intrinsically, essentially and as a kind from any hallucinatory experiences. There is, therefore, no neutral “content” that such perceptual experiences share with hallucinations, differing from them only over whether some additional non-psychological condition holds or not. In short, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Husserl <b>was</b> a “disjunctivist”. In addition, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Husserl held that the individual object of any experience, perceptual or hallucinatory, is essential to and partly constitutive of that experience. The argument focuses on three aspects of Husserl’s thought: his account of intentional objects, his notion of horizon, and his account of reality...|$|R

5|$|After a {{long and}} zealously pious life, Cædmon died like a saint: {{receiving}} a premonition of death, he asked to be moved to the abbey's hospice for the terminally ill where, having gathered his friends around him, he died after receiving the Holy Eucharist, just before nocturns. Although he is often listed as a saint, this is not confirmed by Bede and it has recently <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> such assertions are incorrect.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the Arabic {{astronomer}} and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) presented a development of Ptolemy's geocentric epicyclic models in terms of nested spheres. Despite the similarity of this concept to that of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail that it has <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> it reflects an independent development of the concept. In chapters 15–16 of his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of solid matter.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the {{discourse}} of globalization has dominated housing policy in Britain in the last decade. This proposition {{is supported by a}} description of recent housing policy concerns and a tracing of their roots in the globalization discourse. It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the housing policy response to globalization has mirrored the neo-liberal assumptions of the discourse itself. This paper then questions whether there is a viable alternative to the neo-liberal approach of recent housing policy. It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the traditional social democratic approach is ill-suited to the environment created by globalization. However, the paper concludes with an outline of an alternative policy approach which focuses on key issues which globalization brings to the fore, such as risk, social solidarity, and the pursuit of control and self-esteem. It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that,</b> taken together, these issues could constitute a new policy model. Housing policy, globalization,...|$|R
5|$|In practice, the MSE is a {{blend of}} empathic {{descriptive}} phenomenology and empirical clinical observation. It has <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the term phenomenology has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry: current usage, as a set of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient (a synonym for signs and symptoms), is incompatible with the original meaning which was concerned with comprehending a patient's subjective experience.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Gartnait son of Áedán could be the same person as Gartnait son of Domelch, king of the Picts, whose death is reported around 601, but this rests on the idea of Pictish matriliny, which has been criticised. Even less certainly, it has <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Gartnait's successor in the Pictish king-lists, Nechtan, was his grandson, and thus Áedán's great-grandson.|$|E
5|$|Other {{commentators}} {{have suggested that}} the manner of St Edmund's death, veneration and culthood define him as a sacral king.

5|$|A tidal {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding the star, {{and in some cases}} creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by the disruption of a main sequence star by a black hole of several million times the mass of the Sun, although it has subsequently <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the disruption of a white dwarf by a black hole of mass about 10 thousand times the Sun may be more likely.|$|E
40|$|This thesis defends two arguments. First, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> new atheism and Protestant {{fundamentalism}} in Britain and America share {{a common}} historical root in the English Reformation and its aftermath. This common historical root gave rise to two presuppositions instrumental in their genesis: a literal, univocal, and perspicuous understanding of Scripture, and a disruptive and substitutionary conception of divine activity in nature. Second, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> these two presuppositions continue to structure both forms of thought, and support a range of shared biblical, hermeneutical, and theological beliefs. In advancing these arguments, a number of substantive conclusions regarding atheism, Protestant fundamentalism, and the lineage of Protestant thought in Britain and America are reached. First, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that,</b> while lacking detail, popular comparisons between new atheism and Protestant fundamentalism are cogent. Second, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> atheism in Britain and America grew out of intellectual and social problems within Protestantism. Third, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Protestant fundamentalism <b>was</b> itself {{a response to the}} same train of problems that gave rise to atheism. Fourth, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> new atheism <b>is</b> not an areligious movement but an atheological one, which finds it necessary to engage in the task of theology in order to reject the existence of God and the truth of the Christian faith. Fifth, this study casts doubt on the self-understanding of both Protestant fundamentalism and new atheism, showing that Protestant fundamentalism is not truly biblical, nor new atheism scientific, but that both are indebted to presuppositions that neither can properly justify, and which render both self-contradictory...|$|R

The paper gives a short outline of human rationality {{as a matter of}} following plans and it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> how this perspective is mirrored in some of the dominant conventional learning theories. Inspired by Lave and Wenger’s (1991) approach to situated learning the heterogeneous aspect of practice is highlighted and it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> we analytically need to distinguish between learning to master specific elements in various communities of practice and to orient oneself in a multiple-contextual practice. Finally, by using an example from our preliminary study of building a house it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> learning most <b>be</b> seeing a part of processes of conflict and cooperation...|$|R
5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, it has <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury the {{bimetallic}} relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. It is a matter of debate as whether he intended to do this or not. It has <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.|$|E
