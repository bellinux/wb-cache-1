40|$|Although the caste {{concept has}} {{been central to}} our {{understanding}} of the organization of work in social insect colonies, the concept has been the subject of considerable recent criticism. Theoretically, it has been suggested that temporal castes are too inflexible to allow a colony to rapidly reallocate labour in response to changing conditions. In addition, several authors have suggested that task switching is so prevalent that it precludes even the possibility of a rigidly controlled temporal caste system. This study addresses these two criticisms by presenting and testing a revision of the temporal caste concept that recognizes two categories of tasks: those that require a physiological specialization for their efficient performance, and those that all workers are equally able to perform. Only those tasks requiring a physiological specialization are relevant to the temporal caste concept. Two castes of honeybees were shown to vary in response to increased nectar influx, which requires a physiological specialization, but not to heat stress, which requires no specialization. This work suggests that the organization of work in social insect colonies reflects a compromise between selection for the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> <b>of</b> labour and opposing selection for flexibility in task allocation...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by Adam Smith and Friedrich Hayek, {{many economists}} have {{postulated}} {{the existence of}} invisible forces that drive economic markets. These market forces interact in complex ways {{making it difficult to}} visualize or understand the interactions in every detail. Here I show how these forces can transcend a zero-sum game and become a win-win business interaction, thanks to emergent social synergies triggered by <b>division</b> <b>of</b> labor. Computer simulations with the model Sociodynamica show here the detailed dynamics underlying this phenomenon in a simple virtual economy. In these simulations, independent agents act in an economy exploiting and trading two different goods in a heterogeneous environment. All and each of the various forces and individuals were tracked continuously, allowing to unveil a synergistic effect on economic output produced by the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> labor between agents. Running simulations in a homogeneous environment, for example, eliminated all <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> <b>of</b> labor. The simulations showed that the synergies unleashed by <b>division</b> <b>of</b> labor arise if: Economies work in a heterogeneous environment; agents engage in complementary activities whose optimization processes diverge; agents have means to synchronize their activities.

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{success of}} social insects is often attributed {{to an increase}} in efficiency achieved through <b>division</b> <b>of</b> labor between workers in a colony. Much research has therefore focused on the mechanism by which a <b>division</b> <b>of</b> labor is implemented, i. e., on how tasks are allocated to workers. However, the important assumption that specialists are indeed more efficient at their work than generalist individuals [...] the "Jack-of-all-trades is master of none" hypothesis [...] has rarely been tested. Here, I quantify worker efficiency, measured as work completed per time, in four different tasks in the ant Temnothorax albipennis: honey and protein foraging, collection of nest-building material, and brood transports in a colony emigration. I show that individual efficiency is not predicted by how specialized workers were on the respective task. Worker efficiency is also not consistently predicted by that worker's overall activity or delay to begin the task. Even when only the worker's rank relative to nestmates in the same colony was used, specialization did not predict efficiency in three out of the four tasks, and more specialized workers actually performed worse than others in the fourth task (collection of sand grains). I also show that the above relationships, as well as median individual efficiency, do not change with colony size. My results demonstrate that in an ant species without morphologically differentiated worker castes, workers may nevertheless differ in their ability to perform different tasks. Surprisingly, this variation is not utilized by the colony [...] worker allocation to tasks is unrelated to their ability to perform them. What, then, are the adaptive <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> behavioral specialization, and why do workers choose tasks without regard for whether they can perform them well?

Since divisions have information that is not available to the centre, {{it is useful to}} allow the divisions some autonomy in their sales and procurement decisions.

In most of the models presented in this paper, the centre cannot observe the market price of the intermediate product, and in some models it cannot observe divisional costs. It is shown how the centre can obtain the full information solution in the simplest case by using a penalty factor that encourages internal trade. However, when divisional costs are not observable, the full information outcome is not obtainable. In this case, the optimal value of the penalty factor implies a tradeoff between the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> allowing <b>divisions</b> to act to take advantage of price opportunities in outside markets and savings in transactions costs <b>of</b> trades between <b>divisions.</b> ...|$|R

Here, we investigate a potential route to {{increasing the number}} of spatial mode channels within a single core few-mode fiber. Key for longer transmission distances and low computational complexity is the fabrication of fibers with low differential mode group delays. As such in this work, we combine wavelength and mode-division multiplexed transmission over a 4. 45 km low-DMGD 6 -LP-mode fiber by employing low-loss all-fiber 10 -port photonic lanterns to couple light {{in and out of the}} fiber.
