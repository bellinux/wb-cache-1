25|$|In some online lotteries, {{the annual}} {{payments}} are only $25,000, with a <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> {{in the final}} year. This type of installment payment is often made through investment in government-backed securities. Online lotteries pay the winners through their insurance backup. However, many winners choose lump sum, since they believe {{they can get a}} better rate of return on their investment elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} New Deal {{following}} the Great Depression, the US federal government created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) with the National Housing Act of 1934 {{to assist in the}} construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation of residential properties. The FHA helped develop and standardize the fixed-rate mortgage {{as an alternative to the}} <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> mortgage by insuring them, and helped the mortgage design garner usage.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} common indices are the rates on 1-year constant-maturity Treasury (CMT) securities, the cost of funds index (COFI), and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). A few lenders use their own cost of funds as an index, rather than using other indices. This is done to ensure a steady margin for the lender, whose own cost of funding will usually {{be related to the}} index. Consequently, {{payments}} made by the borrower may change over time with the changing interest rate (alternatively, the term of the loan may change). This is distinct from the graduated payment mortgage, which offers changing payment amounts but a fixed interest rate. Other forms of mortgage loan include the interest-only mortgage, the fixed-rate mortgage, the negative amortization mortgage, and the <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> mortgage.|$|E

2500|$|The best current {{example is}} {{illustrated}} by the United States Geological Survey study of Columbia Glacier. [...] They noted that the average calving rate from Columbia Glacier increased from 3km3⋅a−1 {{in the second half of}} 1983 to 4km3⋅a−1 during the first nine months of 1984. This rate was four times greater than that measured at the end of 1977 and increased again in 1985. The glacier flow, i.e., the movement of the ice toward the sea, also increased, it was inadequate to keep pace with the break-up and expulsion of icebergs. [...] The increase in speed instead seemed to just feed the ever faster conveyor to the terminus for iceberg production. This prompted the USGS to predict that the glacier would retreat 32km before stabilizing. [...] By 2006, it has retreated 16km. The water remains deep and the calving rate and glacier velocity very high, indicating retreat will continue. At this point, just like having a <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> in an adjustable rate mortgage, the glacier has to pay a whole new portion of its balance via icebergs. [...] The glacier accelerates as flow is enhanced by the calving process; this increases the export of icebergs from the glacier. [...] Large calving retreats are initiated by warming conditions causing ice thinning. [...] The resulting retreat to a new equilibrium conditions can be far more extensive than will be regained during the next advance stage. A good example of this is Muir Glacier.|$|E
50|$|With partial amortization, a <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> {{will still}} be {{required}} at maturity, covering {{the part of the}} loan amount still outstanding. This approach is very common in automotive financing where the <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> is often calculated with respect to the value of the vehicle {{at the end of the}} financing term—so the borrower can return the vehicle in lieu of making the <b>balloon</b> <b>payment.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{banking and}} finance, {{refinancing}} risk {{is the possibility}} that a borrower cannot refinance by borrowing to repay existing debt. Many types of commercial lending incorporate <b>balloon</b> <b>payments</b> at the point of final maturity; often, the intention or assumption is that the borrower will take out a new loan to pay the existing lenders.|$|R
50|$|The {{terms of}} the lending {{agreement}} are the key elements of the contractual terms of a promissory note regarding repayment including the amount(s) loaned and to be repaid, loan fees, time value and risk value interest charges, due dates, <b>balloon</b> <b>payments,</b> default terms and more.

5000|$|They meet vital {{cash flow}} needs of farmers: Many borrowers in {{developing}} countries are farmers who demand loans with <b>balloon</b> <b>payments,</b> repayable after they harvest their crops. When the borrower has use of the full amount of principal throughout the entire loan term, flat rate calculations equate to true rate. For farmers accustomed to these types of transactions, flat rate cash loans are familiar and easy to understand.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> {{mortgage}} is {{a mortgage}} {{which does not}} fully amortize over the term of the note, thus leaving a balance due at maturity. [...] The final payment is called a <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> because of its large size. <b>Balloon</b> <b>payment</b> mortgages are more common in commercial real estate than in residential real estate. A <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> mortgage may have a fixed or a floating interest rate. The most common way of describing a balloon loan uses the terminology X due in Y, where X {{is the number of}} years over which the loan is amortized, and Y is the year in which the principal balance is due.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> {{mortgage}} is the 7-year Fannie Mae Balloon, which features monthly payments based on a 30-year amortization. In the United States, {{the amount of the}} <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> must be stated in the contract if Truth-in-Lending provisions apply to the loan.|$|E
50|$|Adjustable rate {{mortgages}} {{are sometimes}} confused with <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> mortgages. The distinction {{is that a}} <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> may require refinancing or repayment {{at the end of}} the period; some adjustable rate mortgages do not need to be refinanced, and the interest rate is automatically adjusted {{at the end of the}} applicable period. Some countries do not allow <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> mortgages for residential housing: the lender must continue the loan (the reset option is required). To the borrower, therefore, there is no risk that the lender will refuse to refinance or continue the loan.|$|E
25|$|APR is {{dependent}} on the time period for which the loan is calculated. That is, the APR for one loan with a 30-year loan duration cannot be compared to the APR for another loan with a 20-year loan duration. APR can be used to show the relative impact of different payment schedules (such as <b>balloon</b> <b>payments</b> or bi-weekly payments instead of straight monthly payments), but most standard APR calculators have difficulty with those calculations.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{dramatic}} rise in subprime foreclosures {{over the}} past several years has led to calls for restrictions of, or prohibitions against, a range of lending practices loosely termed “predatory. ” Several cities and states have enacted legislation or regulations aimed at eliminating predatory practices, and some advocacy groups have endorsed action nationally. This working paper uses data from the Chicago metropolitan area to examine the impact of two frequently cited predatory lending practices, long prepayment penalty periods and <b>balloon</b> <b>payments,</b> on the probability of foreclosure on subprime refinance and home purchase mortgages. This paper also examines the impact of low- and no-documentation, and how combinations of low- and no-documentation, long prepayment penalty periods, and <b>balloon</b> <b>payments</b> affect foreclosure rates. Findings indicate that the impact of each of those loan features on the probability of foreclosure varies by loan category, meaning whether the loan is a refinance or a home purchase loan, and whether the loan is a fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) or an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). Taken individually, long prepayment penalty periods and low- or nodocumentation are associated with a greater or lesser probability of foreclosure, or have n...|$|R

Empirical results show that the typical local predatory lending law tends to reduce rejections, while having little impact on the flow (application and origination) of credit.

5000|$|Because borrowers may {{not have}} the {{resources}} to make the <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> {{at the end of the}} loan term, a [...] "two-step" [...] mortgage plan may be used with <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> mortgages.

[...] For <b>balloon</b> <b>payment</b> mortgages without a reset option or where the reset option is not available, the expectation is that either the borrower will have sold the property or refinanced the loan by the end of the loan term.
