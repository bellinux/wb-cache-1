5|$|<b>Baseball</b> <b>was</b> a {{reasonably}} popular sport in Australia {{in the early}} 20th century and Ponsford alternated between cricket and baseball throughout his sporting life. At the time, <b>baseball</b> <b>was</b> generally played in Australia during the winter months, {{as many of the}} leading players were enthusiastic cricketers who viewed the sport as a means of improving their fielding skills. As with cricket, Ponsford started his baseball career at Alfred Crescent School, where his coach was the former Victorian player Charles Landsdown. As a junior Ponsford played shortstop, later as a senior for the Fitzroy Baseball Club he converted to catching.|$|E

5|$|Another {{influential}} early mainframe {{game was}} Baseball, a sports game {{that was created}} on a PDP-10 minicomputer at Pomona College in 1971 by English major Don Daglow. <b>Baseball</b> <b>was</b> the first baseball video game that allowed players to manage the game as it unfolded, rather than just picking players {{at the beginning of}} a game. The program is documented at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. <b>Baseball</b> <b>was</b> continually updated through 1974, and distributed to other PDP-10 installations. The text-based game had each player control the pitcher or the batter; they would enter their intention to, for example, pitch to or walk the batter, or switch hitters. The batting player could direct on-base players to steal, and the batter to hit. The results of the play would be printed out onto paper as a verbose description, like a radio description of the game. Daglow went on to develop more sophisticated baseball games in 1983 with Intellivision World Series Baseball, and 1987 with Earl Weaver Baseball, as well as numerous other games.|$|E
