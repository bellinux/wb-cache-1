25|$|The first {{transgenic}} organism {{was created in}} 1974 when Annie Chang and Stanley Cohen expressed Staphylococcus aureus genes in Escherichia coli. In 1978, yeast cells were the first eukaryotic organisms to undergo gene transfer. Mouse cells were first transformed in 1979, followed by mouse embryos in 1980. Most {{of the very first}} transmutations were performed by microinjection of DNA directly into cells. Scientist were able to develop other methods to perform the transformations, such as incorporating transgenes into retroviruses and then infecting cells, using electroinfusion which takes advantage of an electric current to pass foreign DNA through the cell wall, <b>biolistics</b> which is the procedure of shooting DNA bullets into cells, and also delivering DNA into the egg that has just been fertilized.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the DNA of {{interest}} {{needs to be}} isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a vector (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using restriction enzymes, and incubated with the fragment {{of interest}} under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called DNA ligase. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, electroporation, optical injection and <b>biolistics.</b> Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, {{there is a need}} to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable antibiotic resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on X-gal medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of PCR, restriction fragment analysis and/or DNA sequencing.|$|E

2500|$|Gene guns (also {{known as}} <b>biolistics)</b> [...] "shoot" [...] (direct high energy {{particles}} or radiations against) target genes into plant cells. It {{is the most}} common method. DNA is bound to tiny particles of gold or tungsten which are subsequently shot into plant tissue or single plant cells under high pressure. The accelerated particles penetrate both the cell wall and membranes. The DNA separates from the metal and is integrated into plant DNA inside the nucleus. This method has been applied successfully for many cultivated crops, especially monocots like wheat or maize, for which transformation using Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been less successful. The major disadvantage of this procedure is that serious damage can be done to the cellular tissue.|$|E
50|$|In plants the DNA is {{generally}} inserted using Agrobacterium-mediated recombination, {{taking advantage of}} the Agrobacteriums T-DNA sequence that allows natural insertion of genetic material into plant cells. Another method is <b>biolistics,</b> where particles of gold or tungsten are coated with DNA and then shot into young plant cells or plant embryos. Another transformation method for plant and animal cells is electroporation. This involves subjecting the cell to an electric shock, which can make the cell membrane permeable to plasmid DNA. Due to the damage caused to the cells and DNA the transformation efficiency of <b>biolistics</b> and electroporation is lower than agrobacterial mediated transformation and microinjection.|$|E
50|$|A {{gene gun}} or a biolistic {{particle}} delivery system, originally designed for plant transformation, is a device for delivering exogenous DNA (transgenes) to cells. The payload is an elemental particle {{of a heavy}} metal coated with DNA (typically plasmid DNA). This technique is often simply referred to as <b>biolistics.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Biolistics</b> {{has proven}} to be a {{versatile}} method of genetic modification and it is generally preferred to engineer transformation-resistant crops, such as cereals. Notably, Bt maize is a product of <b>biolistics.</b> Plastid transformation has also seen great success with particle bombardment when compared to other current techniques, such as Agrobacterium mediated transformation, which have difficulty targeting the vector to and stably expressing in the chloroplast. In addition, there are no reports of a chloroplast silencing a transgene inserted with a gene gun. Additionally, with only one firing of a gene gun, a skilled technician can generate two transformed organisms. This technology has even allowed for modification of specific tissues in situ, although this is likely to damage large numbers of cells and transform only some, rather than all, cells of the tissue.|$|E
50|$|Another {{transformation}} {{method for}} {{plant and animal}} cells is electroporation, which involves subjecting cells to an electric shock, which can make the cell membrane permeable to plasmid DNA. In some cases the electroporated cells will incorporate the DNA. Due to the associated cell and DNA damage, the transformation efficiency of <b>biolistics</b> and electroporation is lower than with agrobacteria and microinjection.|$|E
50|$|The genetic {{transformation}} of crops involves {{the incorporation of}} 'foreign' genes or rather, very small DNA fragments compared to introgression discussed earlier. Amongst other uses, transformation is a useful tool to introduce new traits or characteristics into the transformed crop. Two methods are commonly employed: infectious bacterial-mediated (usually Agrobacterium) and <b>biolistics,</b> with the latter being most commonly applied to allopolyploid cereals such as triticale. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, however, holds several advantages, such as {{a low level of}} transgenic DNA rearrangement, a low number of introduced copies of the transforming DNA, stable integration of an a-priori characterized T-DNA fragment (containing the DNA expressing the trait of interest) and an expected higher level of transgene expression. Triticale has, until recently, only been transformed via <b>biolistics,</b> with a 3.3% success rate (Zimny et al. 1995). Little has been documented on Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of wheat; while no data existed with respect to triticale until 2005, the success rate in later work was nevertheless low.|$|E

50|$|Wild {{tomatoes}} are small, green and largely unappetizing, but after centuries of breeding {{there are now}} thousands of varieties grown worldwide. Agrobacterium-mediated genetic engineering techniques were developed in the late 1980s that could successfully transfer genetic material into the nuclear genome of tomatoes. Genetic material can also be inserted into a tomato cell's chloroplast and chromoplast plastomes using <b>biolistics.</b> Tomatoes were the first food crop with an edible fruit where this was possible.|$|E
50|$|About 1% of {{bacteria}} are naturally {{able to take}} up foreign DNA, but this ability can be induced in other bacteria. Stressing the bacteria with a heat shock or an electric shock can make the cell membrane permeable to DNA that may then incorporate into the genome or exist as extrachromosomal DNA. DNA is generally inserted into animal cells using microinjection, {{where it can be}} injected through the cells nuclear envelope directly into the nucleus or through the use of viral vectors. In plants the DNA is generally inserted using Agrobacterium-mediated recombination or <b>biolistics.</b>|$|E
50|$|Transgenics {{involves}} {{the insertion of}} one piece of DNA into another organism’s DNA in order to introduce a new gene(s) into the original organism. This addition of genes into an organism’s genetic material creates a new variety with desired traits. The DNA must be prepared and packaged in a test tube and then inserted into the new organism. New genetic information can be inserted with <b>biolistics.</b> An example of transgenics is the rainbow papaya, which is modified with a gene that gives it resistance to the Papaya Ringspot Virus.|$|E

Thus the DNA may {{be transformed into}} whatever genomes {{are present in the}} cell, be they nuclear, mitochondrial, plasmid or any others, in any combination, though proper construct design may mitigate this. Another issue is that the gene inserted may be overexpressed when the construct is inserted multiple times in either the same or different locations of the genome. This is due to the ability of the constructs to give and take genetic material from other constructs, causing some to carry no transgene and others to carry multiple copies; the number of copies inserted depends on both how many copies of the transgene an inserted construct has, and how many were inserted. Also, because eukaryotic constructs rely on illegitimate recombination, a process by which the transgene is integrated into the genome without similar genetic sequences, and not homologous recombination, which inserts at similar sequences, they cannot be targeted to specific locations within the genome, unless the transgene is co-delivered with genome editing reagents.|$|E

Transfection efficiency was determined using either a b-galactosidase or placental alkaline phosphatase reporter gene. The effect of.. promoter strength was analyzed by transfecting plasmids with either the Rous sarcoma virus RSV promoter or cytomegalovirus CMV promoter regions. Results: Optimal conditions for particle-mediated gene transfer utilized gold particles of 1. 6 mm diameter, a target. distance of 3 cm, helium pressures of 8. 96 MPa 1300 psi and cell confluence of 75 %.

40|$|The use of {{transgenic}} {{technologies for}} the genetic manipulation of plant species {{has had a}} profound impact on basic plant research and biotechnology. Overexpression of heterogonous genes, for example, is widely used for the introduction of novel traits into transgenic crop plants. Overexpression can also be used in combination with down-regulation and controlled expression (e. g. induced, developmentally regulated, or tissue specific) studies as a tool for basic plant research and for functional analysis of native genes in various model plants. Two crucial components are required for the transient and/or stable expression of foreign genes in plant cells. The first is a plasmid vector capable of carrying the foreign gene-encoding sequence and the regulatory elements, i. e. promoter and terminator sequences, needed for its expression in plant cells (thus collectively referred to as an expression cassette). The second is the biological or physical methods by which the vector can be delivered into the target plant cells. With the exception of virusmediated gene expression, where the distinction between the plasmid vector and the vehicle itself is rather blurry, <b>biolistics,</b> polyethylene glycol, and Agrobacteriummediated gene transfer all require plasmid vectors, some of which have been specifically designed for optimal use by a particular method. Thus, for example, small and multicopy plasmids are most useful vectors for <b>biolistics</b> and polyethylene glycol-mediated genetic transformation where large quantities of DNA are typically used in each experiment. On the other hand, single-copy plasmids carrying certain biological features have been specifically designed for use with Agrobacterium as the transformation vehicle.
