60|$|Poor Jock, who, {{whatever}} he was, was real {{in all his}} ways, and could not lead a double life, as his friend too often did, read and tried to fulfil the injunctions of the book, but only became more confused and unhappy than ever. Yet still he held on, in a <b>blind</b> <b>sort</b> of way, to his resolution. He had undertaken to be good, he meant therefore to communicate, and he believed he repented, and would lead a new life—-if—-if he could bear it.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – We {{are looking}} for a very secure method of remote {{authentication}}. Biometrics authentication has become popular with the increase in infrastructure facilities and scope of sensor technologies. They are suited due to high security in applications like remote authentication. We are considering a provably secure and <b>blind</b> <b>sort</b> of biometric authentication protocol combined with the advantages of Kerberos’s ticket granting. We are using cryptography to make the protocol more secure. It can successfully run over public network for remote access. It can also be implemented {{to take care of the}} revoking of registered templates. It is not biometric specific. The main Kerberos part comes in because of the ticket granting mechanism. Kerberos and biometrics are already proven to survive range of attacks. Finally we show a central, already secure, server that can be used for mass authentication and a wide range of applications...|$|R

I am {{angry and}} naughty--not like Celia: I have a great outburst, and then all seems glorious again. I cannot help believing in glorious things in a <b>blind</b> <b>sort</b> of way. I should be quite willing to enjoy the art here, but {{there is so much}} that I don't know the reason of--so much that seems to me a consecration of ugliness rather than beauty. The {{painting}} and sculpture may be wonderful, but the feeling is often low and brutal, and sometimes even ridiculous. Here and there I see what takes me at once as noble--something that I might compare with the Alban Mountains or the sunset from the Pincian Hill; but that makes it the greater pity that there is so little of the best kind among all that mass of things over which men have toiled so." ...|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Woodward {{was greatly}} afflicted. She was indeed {{sorry to hear}} such tidings of Charley Tudor; but her grief was now deeper even than that. She could not be longer <b>blind</b> to the <b>sort</b> of feeling which her child evinced for this young man; she could not think that these passionate bursts of overpowering sorrow {{were the result of}} mere childish friendship; she could not but see that her Katie's bosom now held a woman's heart, and that that heart was no longer her own.|$|R
60|$|As {{for those}} miracles which he {{continually}} wrought, they passed, in his opinion, as {{the effects of}} innocence in children, or for the fruits of faith in sick persons. And when, {{at the sight of}} a miraculous performance, the people were at any time about to give him particular honours, he ran to hide himself in the thickest of a forest; or when he could not steal away, he entered so far into the knowledge of himself, that he stood secure from the least temptation of vain glory. It even seemed, that the low opinion which he had of his own worth, in some <b>sort</b> <b>blinded</b> him, in relation to the wonders which he wrought, so that he perceived not they were miracles.|$|R
60|$|Peter Ruff rose {{to receive}} his former {{sweetheart}} with an agitation perforce concealed, yet to him poignant indeed. For {{it was indeed}} Maud who entered the room and came towards him with carefully studied embarrassment and half doubtfully extended hand. He {{did not see the}} cheap millinery, the slightly more developed figure, the passing of that insipid prettiness which had once charmed him into the bloom of an over-early maturity. His eyes were <b>blinded</b> with that <b>sort</b> of masculine chivalry--the heritage only of fools and very clever men--which takes no note of such things. It was Miss Brown who, from her place {{in a corner of the}} room, ran over the cheap attractions of this unwelcome visitor with an expression of scornful wonder--who understood the tinsel of her jewellery, the cheap shoddiness of her ready-made gown; who appreciated, with merciless judgment, her mincing speech, her cheap, flirtatious method.|$|R
40|$|Abstract What role {{categorization}} processes play in chemosensory {{expertise and}} its acquisition? In this paper, we address this question by exploring the criteria used by trained and untrained assessors when they categorize beers. Two experimental factors were manipulated: beer color and brewery. Participants sorted nine commercial beers coming {{in three different}} colors and from three different breweries. Participants sorted in two different conditions: in one condition, participants could see the beers, {{and in the other}} condition, they could not see the beers. We observed that in both tasting conditions (i. e., with or without vision), trained and untrained assessors categorized beers similarly. In the visual condition, assessors sorted beers by color, whereas in the <b>blind</b> condition, they <b>sorted</b> them by brewery. Overall, our results indicate that sensory training {{does not seem to have}} an effect on the criteria used to organize beer perceptions. This suggests that our trained beer assessors did not develop specific conceptual representations of beers during training. Moreover, it seems that when assessors categorize beers, they rely more on visual than on chemosensory information...|$|R
60|$|I {{know that}} {{young men in}} general do not admit of any enquiry even from their nearest {{relations}} into affairs of the heart, but I hope, my dear Reginald, {{that you will be}} superior to such as allow nothing for a father's anxiety, and think themselves privileged to refuse him their confidence and slight his advice. You must be sensible that as an only son, and the representative of an ancient family, your conduct in life is most interesting to your connections; and in the very important concern of marriage especially, there is everything at stake--your own happiness, that of your parents, and the credit of your name. I do not suppose that you would deliberately form an absolute engagement of that nature without acquainting your mother and myself, or at least, without being convinced that we should approve of your choice; but I cannot help fearing that you may be drawn in, by the lady who has lately attached you, to a marriage which the whole of your family, far and near, must highly reprobate. Lady Susan's age is itself a material objection, but her want of character is one so much more serious, that the difference of even twelve years becomes in comparison of small amount. Were you not <b>blinded</b> by a <b>sort</b> of fascination, it would be ridiculous in me to repeat the instances of great misconduct on her side so very generally known.|$|R
40|$|The Internet {{has become}} the {{dominant}} means of communication in modern society. Increased use of and dependence on such things as email and the web has speeded up communication and allowed {{for a wide range}} of new ways in which we can communicate. The use of social media and Internet based shopping are amongst the most common forms of this development. Images are particularly common in such media. They are used for all sorts of purposes – from displaying products or pictures of individuals to decorations of all <b>sorts.</b> <b>Blind</b> people have the same rights and needs to use these modern technologies and so making sure that they can gain benefit from the images contained on these media is vital. The World Wide Web Consortium has drawn up specifications for the ways in which such images should be adaptable for best value by blind users. However, a large proportion of authors of web content do nothing to annotate the images they use in a way that would be of value to blind users. A number of attempts have been made to create adaptation processes in which descriptions can be added to images after the page has been created. All of these methods use information and activity outside of the process of loading the pages – often involving large amounts of human effort. The work for this research has identified that it is possible to take the information that is already available inside the web pages themselves to enable valuable descriptions to be added to all image elements within pages in such a way that the usefulness of the images is improved for blind users. The software developed has made use of an algorithm which can define image purpose. In addition the algorithm uses mining of local data on the web pages to determine the relationship between the images and the text on the page to create an annotation of the images which is meaningful. An ethnographic study has revealed that the image descriptions should be clear, precise and meaningful and this has been the major aim of the software that has been developed. The mechanism was tested with two groups of blind users under different conditions. The first test revealed inadequacies in the software. These were tackled and the second test showed that the software enabled all users to gain better access to images in web pages that were adapted by the software than they were able to achieve for non-adapted web pages. A number of possible extensions to the work have been established...|$|R
