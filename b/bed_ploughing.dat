40|$|The field {{observations}} of G. S. Boulton stimulated widespread interest in deformable beds. Shear resistance of till in its critical state is insensitive to strain rate and increases linearly with effective pressure. During unsteady deformation, pseudo-viscous shear resistance {{can be caused}} by dilation of consolidated tills and resultant pore-pressure decline. This effect is probably uncommon, however, because susceptible tills of low hydraulic diffusivity are also those least likely to consolidate significantly during effective-pressure transients. Stick–slip motion at Whillans Ice Stream, Antarctica, indicates that its basal till must weaken during rapid slip and strengthen during longer periods of slower slip. Recurrence intervals for rapid-slip episodes there (6 – 18 hours) indicate that till-strength variations, if driven by changes in pore pressure either related or unrelated to basal freezing, are focused in the uppermost several centimeters of the <b>bed.</b> <b>Ploughing</b> of grains at the bed surface and associated excess pore pressures in adjacent till can account for rate-weakening during rapid slip, with pore-pressure decay causing strengthening between slip episodes. By promoting shallow, sluggish subglacial water flow and low effective pressure, soft beds may help sustain themselves by slowing their own transport. Soft-bed shear resistance, kinematics and continuity are problems rooted in subglacial hydrology...|$|E

40|$|Mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGLs) are {{longitudinally}} aligned corrugations (ridge-groove structures 6 - 100 km long) in sediment produced subglacially. They are {{indicators of}} fast flow {{and a common}} signature of ice-stream beds. We develop a qualitative theory that accounts for their formation, and use numerical modelling, and observations of ice-stream beds to provide supporting evidence. Ice in contact with a rough (scale of 10 - 10 (3) m) bedrock surface will mimic {{the form of the}} bed. Because of flow acceleration and convergence in ice-stream onset zones, the ice-base roughness elements experience transverse strain, transforming them from irregular bumps into longitudinally aligned keels of ice protruding downwards. Where such keels slide across a soft sedimentary <b>bed,</b> they <b>plough</b> through the sediments, carving elongate grooves, and deforming material up into intervening ridges. This explains MSGLs and has important implications for ice-stream mechanics. Groove ploughing provides the means to acquire new lubricating sediment and to transport large volumes of it downstream. Keels may provide basal drag in the force budget of ice streams, thereby playing a role in flow regulation and stability We speculate that groove ploughing permits significant ice-stream widening, thus facilitating high-magnitude ice discharge...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. If basal-water {{discharge}} {{and pressure}} are sufficiently high, a soft-bedded glacier will slip over its <b>bed</b> by <b>ploughing,</b> {{the process in}} which particles that span the ice–bed interface are dragged across the bed surface. Results of laboratory experiments indicate that resistance to ploughing can decrease with increasing ploughing velocity (velocity weakening). During ploughing at various velocities (15 – 400 ma– 1), till was compacted in front of idealized particles, causing pore pressures there that were orders of magnitude higher than the ambient value. This excess pore pressure locally weakened the till in shear, thereby decreasing ploughing resistance {{by a factor of}} 3. 0 – 6. 6 with a six-fold increase in ploughing velocity. Characteristic timescales of pore-pressure diffusion and compaction down-glacier from ploughing particles depend on till diffusivity, ploughing velocity and sizes of ploughing particles. These timescales accurately predict the ranges of these variables over which excess pore pressure and velocity weakening occurred. Existing ploughing models do not account for velocity weakening. A new ploughing model with no adjustable parameters predicts ploughing resistance to no worse than 38 % but requires that excess pore pressures be measured. Velocity weakening by this mechanism may affect fast glacier flow, sediment transport by bed deformation and basal seismicity. 1...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{conservation}} agriculture (CA) {{is to improve}} soil quality and crop yield whilst reducing runoff and topsoil erosion. An experiment {{was carried out in}} a rainfed field using a permanent raised bed planting system for 3 yr (2005 – 2007) in Adigudem, northern Ethiopia in order to evaluate the effect of CA on runoff, soil loss and crop yield. CA practices were introduced in fields with Vertisols in a randomized complete block design on permanent 5 · 19 m plots. Three treatments were evaluated: (1) conventional tillage (CT) with a minimum of three tillage operations and removal of crop residues, (2) terwah (TER) that was similar to CT except that contour furrows were included at 1. 5 m intervals, and (3) derdero+ (DER+), which consists of permanent raised beds with a furrow and bed system, retention of 30 % of standing crop residues and zero tillage {{on the top of the}} <b>bed.</b> All <b>ploughing</b> as well as the maintenance of the furrows of the permanent raised beds was done using a local ard plough called maresha. Results from monitoring over 3 yr showed that soil loss and runoff were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) in CT followed by TER and DER+. Average soil losses of 5. 2, 20. 1 and 24. 2 t ⁄ ha were recorded from DER+, TER and CT, respectively. Runoff was 46. 3, 76. 3 and 98. 1 mm from DER+, TER and CT, respectively. Grain yield was significantly lower (P < 0. 05) in DER+ under teff in 2006, probably due to the high sensitivity of teff to weeds. The yield of wheat in 2007 was significantly higher in DER+ followed by TER. The terwah system is recommended as a first measure for wider adoption to reduce runoff and soil loss and to increase crop yield. The long-term goal is to achieve a derdero+ system, i. e. a permanent raised bed planting system along with the application of crop residues. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In Ethiopia, {{repeated}} plowing, {{complete removal}} of crop residues at harvest and aftermath grazing of crop fi elds {{have reduced the}} biomass return to the soil and aggravated cropland degradation. Conservation Agriculture (CA) -based cropping systems may reduce runoff and soil erosion, and improve soil quality and crop productivity. Thus, a long-term tillage experiment {{has been carried out}} (2005 to 20123) on a Vertisol to quantify - among others - changes in runoff and soil loss for two local tillage practices, modifi ed to integrate CA principles in semi-arid northern Ethiopia. The experimental layout was a randomized complete block design with three replications on permanent plots of 5 m by 19 m. The tillage treatments were (i) derdero+ (DER+) with a furrow and permanent raised <b>bed</b> planting system, <b>ploughed</b> only once at planting by refreshing the furrow from 2005 to 2013 and 30 % standing crop residue retention, (ii) terwah+ (TER+) with furrows made at 1. 5 m interval, plowed once at planting, 30 % standing crop residue retention and fresh broad beds, and (iii) conventional tillage (CT) with a minimum of three plain tillage operations and complete removal of crop residues. Wheat, teff, barley and grass pea were grown in rotation. Runoff and soil loss were measured daily. Signifi cantly different (p< 0. 05) runoff coeffi cients averaged over 9 years were 14, 22 and 30 % for DER+, TER+ and CT, respectively. Mean soil losses were 3 t ha- 1 y- 1 in DER+, 11 in TER+ and 178 in CT. A period of at least three years of cropping was required before improvements in crop yield became signifi cant. Further, modeling of the sediment budgets shows that total soil loss due to sheet and rill erosion in cropland, when CA would be practiced at large scale in a 180 ha catchment, would reduce to 581 t y- 1, instead of 1109 t y- 1 under the current farmer practice. Using NASA/GISS Model II precipitation projections of IPCC scenario A 1 FI, CA is estimated to reduce soil loss and runoff and mitigate the effect of increased rainfall due to climate change. For smallholder farmers in semi-arid agro-ecosystems, CA-based systems constitute a fi eld rainwater and soil conservation improvement strategy that enhances crop and economic productivity and reduces siltation of reservoirs, especially under changing climate. Adoption of CA-based systems in the study area requires further work to improve smallholder farmers’ awareness on benefi ts, to guarantee high standards during implementation and to design appropriate weed management strategies...|$|R
40|$|The GAEC {{standard}} Management of {{set aside}} {{is applied to}} arable lands subjected to set aside and kept non-cultivated throughout the year. The standard is also applied to other set aside areas eligible for direct payments. For the implementation of this Standard, the farmer must assure the presence of natural or artificial green cover on the surface throughout the year and adopt consistent agronomic practices as mowing, or other equivalent, {{in order to maintain}} the normal state of soil fertility, protect wildlife, prevent the formation of a potential inoculum of fires, especially during drought and prevent the spread of weeds. Up to the CAP Health Check the legislation on the set aside required the farmer to plough the soil by mid-May. Therefore, the natural vegetation cover could neither establish nor express its value against erosion throughout the year. Since mid 2004, cross compliance has banned ploughing of set aside surfaces. This novelty is very important in relation to the effectiveness of the standard in erosion control. In Italy there are only few studies carried out in the field that have measured the effect of set aside on soil erosion. The few existing experiments regarded the effect of set aside managed in accordance with the CAP dictates prior to the CAP Health Check. The results of case studies show very contrasting results regarding soil erosion on set aside plots managed through the annual ploughing in the period in which this rule remained in force. This finding can be explained by considering that most of soil erosion in the Mediterranean environment is determined by extreme events; so, set aside resulted ineffective in protecting the soil, when very erosive events occurred on bare soil (soil in seed <b>bed</b> condition after <b>ploughing</b> and harrowing) or when the plant cover of soil was still scarce. In these conditions soil erosion rate resulted similar to that observed in the intensive cropping systems. On the contrary, for events occurred when the natural vegetation was sufficiently developed, the beneficial effect of set aside in limiting erosion was similar to that exerted by total grass cover. In general, it can be argued that on plough set aside, an average period of 2 months is needed for the establishment of natural cover sufficient enough to ensure a significant protection of soil from erosion. The results show that in Italy set aside before the CAP Health Check might have determined a decrease of soil erosion by 50 % (on average). Since 2005, set aside under cross compliance regime appears to have had a greater beneficial effect than before in reducing erosion, as total grass cover was able to decrease soil loss by 98 % compared to intensive farming systems...|$|R
