40|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} {{process in which}} a cutting tool, having multiple transverse cutting edges, is pushed or pulled through a hole or surface to remove metal by axial method. Broaching, if properly used, is a highly productive, precise and extremely versatile process. It is capable of production rates as much as 25 times faster than any traditional metal removing methods. Objectives are to {{lower the cost of}} design process by reducing the time required to design and fabricate <b>broach</b> <b>tools</b> which was materialized by the parametric design of the broach, where the design intent of the <b>broach</b> <b>tool</b> geometry is captured. Another objective is to predict the strength characteristics of the <b>broaching</b> <b>tools</b> in the preliminary stage for the tool engineer which was to evaluate the stress characteristic of the <b>broach</b> <b>tool</b> subjected to the cutting conditions. This would be useful for the tool engineer to keep a check on the tool's strength characteristics during every stage of the tools life and also on improving its characteristics during the wear out period. This was achieved by meshing and performing analysis using the Finite Element Modeller package called IIFEM. The model built from the parametric design was utilized to make a finite element model and analysis was performed to predict the stress and deflection in the tool. This would reduce time to design different broaches. By just changing the dimensions and the constraints when required, a new broach can be designed, thus allowing a lot of flexibility in the design. Further the solid model can be used to perform the finite element analysis which would help in knowing the characteristic of the <b>broach</b> <b>tool</b> under various cutting loads. This would also assist in improving the performance of the tool. 1...|$|R
40|$|Broaching is a {{commonly}} used machining operation in manufacturing of variety of {{internal or external}} complex features. High quality surfaces can be generated with high productivity if proper conditions are used. The main disadvantage of broaching {{is that it is}} not possible to change any of the cutting parameters but the cutting speed during production. That is because all machining parameters, except cutting speed, are built into <b>broaching</b> <b>tools</b> which makes tool design the most important aspect of broaching. In this thesis, a procedure for the optimization of <b>broaching</b> <b>tools</b> is presented. First, the mechanics of the broaching process and general properties of the <b>broach</b> <b>tools</b> are explained. Important design parameters and the effects of them on the broaching process are demonstrated. Most <b>broaching</b> <b>tools</b> have several tool segments with different profiles. One of the critical factors in the design of these tools is the assignment of segment profiles which determine the relative amounts of material removal rate in each section. Several alternatives are tried for optimization of section geometries and their effects are demonstrated by simulations. The objective function of the optimization problem and the constraints due to machine, tool and part limitations are presented. A heuristic optimization algorithm is developed, and demonstrated by examples. It is also shown that by using the algorithm developed the production time can be reduced due to shortened tool length.

Roughing, semi-finishing and finishing can be performed in one stroke of the tool increasing {{productivity and}} reducing set-up time. Furthermore, high quality surface finish can be obtained due to straight motion of the tool. One big disadvantage of broaching is that all process parameters, except cutting speed, are built into <b>broaching</b> <b>tools.</b> Therefore, {{it is not possible}} to modify cutting conditions during the process once the tool is manufactured.

40|$|As the {{performance}} of digital electronic components improves, maintaining the integrity of high-frequency signals through circuit boards becomes increasingly challenging. The dimensions and material parameters of in-plane circuit board features, such as striplines, microstrips and co-planar waveguides are tuned to control signal impedance. Conventional multi-layer vertical interconnects, which connect between board layers, are not impedance matched to the in-plane signal traces. Multi-connection vias, developed in this thesis, provide a method for matching the impedance of vertical and in-plane features by forming co-cylindrical waveguides. Solutions from a high-frequency full-wave solver provide insight into field interactions within multi-connection vias; and results from these simulations and signal integrity experiments indicate impedance "tuneability" by adjusting the multi-connection via dimensions. The results also suggest that features can be impedance-matched independent of via diameter. Multi-connection vias are formed by creating distinct conductor paths within cylindrical plated through-holes. The thesis explores several alternative manufacturing methods for fabricating these features. A specialized broaching machine and carbide-insert broaches were used to manufacture multi-connection vias for signal integrity experiments. Models of the <b>broach</b> <b>tool</b> and cutting force simulations resulted in several iterations of the broach design. (cont.) Broaching multi-connection vias is challenging due to the small diameters and high aspect ratios of plated through-holes, {{as well as the}} unique copper-epoxy/resin material. Since the broaching process prefers larger plated through-holes to permit larger <b>broach</b> <b>tools,</b> a new method was developed to analyze the cumulative connection density of multi-connection via arrays. Multi-connection vias provide fertile ground for the development of corollary electronic products. Simulations for connector launches indicate that via impedance control can extend to board-mounted devices and connectors. Products that may benefit from multi-connection vias include by-pass capatrs, IC packages, test probes and pogo pins. The thesis presents a road map for commercializing multi-connection vias.

40|$|AbstractPrecise force {{measurements}} {{are often used}} {{for the development of}} machining processes. A key measure thereby is the specific cutting force, which comprises several factors such as cutting and work piece material as well as the cutting edge geometry. Therefore, it is vital for cutting tests to be as close to the real application as possible in order to guarantee a good alignment and transferability of the results. In many cutting tests carried out in a laboratory environment this cannot sufficiently be ensured. This paper presents two specific processes being applied in aeronautic industry for which force measurement systems were specially developed to satisfy the mentioned requirements.

40|$|AbstractThe {{substitution}} of wet machining processes by dry processes {{is an important}} development in manufacturing technology. A central challenge is the significant higher heating and thus the resulting thermal expansion of the workpiece which leads to geometrical deviations of the machined part. According {{to the state of}} the art these processes are optimized by trial and error approaches and therefore result in high costs. This paper presents a two-scale finite element model which calculates the thermal deformation of the workpiece in dry turning of normalized steel C 45 E / AISI 1045. The approach consists of two submodels. The first submodel is a fully coupled finite element chip formation model for the calculation of the generated heat and temperature distribution in the chip, workpiece and tool. On this basis the rate of heat flow into the workpiece is determined. In a second model this rate of heat flow is applied to a macroscale model that calculates the instationary temperature distribution and deformation of the whole workpiece. The chip formation model has been validated by an orthogonal cutting process realized on a <b>broaching</b> machine <b>tool</b> while the workpiece model is validated by thermal imaging of an orthogonal turning process...|$|R

The broach is mounted in a special tool holder that allows it to freely rotate. The tool holder is special because it holds the tool so that its axis of rotation is inclined slightly to the axis of rotation of the work. A typical value for this misalignment is 1Â°. This angle is what produces a rotating edge for the broach to cut the workpiece. Either the workpiece or the tool holder is rotated. If the tool holder is rotated, the misalignment causes the broach to appear as though it is [...] "wobbling", which is {{the origin of the}} term wobble broach.|$|R
