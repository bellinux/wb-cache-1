On {{the base of}} the damage manifestation, the failure mechanism of tunnel damage is preliminarily analyzed. Comparison with the failure mode on the shaking table model test has been made, and some suggestion of on the weak links at the tunnel entrance, faults and shallow <b>buried</b> <b>section</b> for designers has been put forward. PREFACE The seismic Damage of the underground structures has not been paid attention as the ground structure. But with the increase of the number of underground structures and frequent damage of the underground structures,The seismic damage of underground structure has received attention gradually by Earthquake workers around the world, in particular, Japan's Kobe earthquake in 1995, due to the structure of the Kobe City underground structure damaged severely, causing the attention of scholars of many earthquakes, research of the earthquake damage has never boom[1]. In 5. 12 Wenchuan earthquake, more than one tunnel on the road suffered varying degrees damage, project team of Chongqing Communications Research and Design Institute has field researched o...|$|E
40|$|Fast-flowing ice {{streams and}} outlet glaciers exert a major control on glacial {{discharge}} from contemporary and past ice sheets. Improving {{our understanding of}} the extent and dynamic behaviour of palaeo-ice streams is crucial for predictions of how the chryosphere will respond to climate warming and the associated implications for global sea level. This paper presents results from two 3 D-seismic surveys located on the continental shelf adjoining the Disko Bay Trough Mouth Fan (TMF), one of the largest glacial outlet systems in Greenland. Located at the seaward terminus of the c. 370 km long cross-shelf Disko Trough, the Disko Bay TMF was generated by highly efficient subglacial sediment delivery onto the continental slope during repeated ice stream advances. A variety of submarine glacial landform assemblages are recognised on the seabed reflecting past ice stream activity. The 3 D-seismic study covers the shallow banks located north and south of the Disko Trough and sheds focus on the seabed and the uppermost stratigraphic interval associated with the late Pleistocene development. The <b>buried</b> <b>section</b> (probably of Saalian age) contains a prominent grounding-zone wedge (GZW) in the northern and low-angle progradational packages in the southern area, indicating a period of major glacial advances to the shelf margin. Subsequently, the outer margin was influenced by glacimarine sedimentation, localized shelf-edge ice advances and sediment transport by contour currents that possibly began in the last interglacial period (Eemian). During the last (de) glaciation, the northern bank appears to have been covered by passive ice leaving a field of dead-ice deposits. In contrast, multiple sets of terminal moraine ridges observed on the southern bank suggest a slow retreat of active, grounded ice from the Last Glacial Maximum position on the outer shelf. Isostatic and tectonic influences on relative sea level may {{have played a role in}} generating the divergent glacial configurations of the northern and southern bank areas...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} in-depth {{information on}} the high speed optical transport requirements for the Square Kilometre Array. The stringent data rates as well as timing and synchronization requirements are dealt {{with respect to the}} optical fibre technology. Regarding the data transport, we draw a clear comparison between a typical telecommunication access network and a telescope network. Invoking simulations and experiments on the field and laboratory test bed, we successfully implement a suitable telescope network using vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) technology. Polarization effects on the KAT- 7 telescope network, an operational prototype for the SKA is studied so as to estimate the expected effect in the MeerKAT telescope with transmission distances _ 12 km. The study further relates the obtained values to the expected impact on the distribution of the time and frequency reference in the MeerKAT array. Clock stability depends on the differential group delay (DGD) and polarization stability. On a 10 : 25 km link that includes the riser cable a DGD of 62 : 1 fs was attained. This corresponds to a polarization mode dispersion (PMD) coefficient of 19 : 4 fs=km 1 = 2. This is a low PMD value considering telecommunication network. The PMD value is within the allowed budget in the telescope network. However, {{this may not be the}} case at longer baselines extending to over 1000 km as expected in SKA 2. The fibre's deployment contribution to the DGD is measured by comparing the deployed fibre to the undeployed of equal lengths. On the 10 : 25 km deployed single mode fibre, the maximum and mean DGDs measured were 217 : 7 fs and 84 : 8 fs respectively. The undeployed fibre of similar type and equal length, gave a maximum and minimum DGDs of 58 : 6 fs and 36 : 3 fs respectively. The deployment is seen to increase the maximum and minimum DGDs by factors of 3. 7 and 2. 3 respectively. This implies that fibre deployment is very critical in ensuring the birefringence is minimized. Polarization fluctuation recorded a maximum of 180 o during the 15 hour real time astronomer use of the antenna. To ascertain the contribution of the riser cable, state of polarization (SOP) of the <b>buried</b> <b>section</b> of the single mode fibre in the link was established. A maximum SOP change of 14 o over 15 hour monitoring was measured. From the stability realized on the <b>buried</b> <b>section</b> of the fibre, the change in polarization is contributed by the riser cable. The fluctuation in polarization can cause the phase of a clock signal to drift between the birefringent axes by an equal amount corresponding to DGD. We experimentally demonstrate how polarization stabilization can be attained using the polarization maintaining fibre. We also demonstrate the applicability of VCSEL technology in the SKA unidirectional data flow especially for shorter baselines < 100 km. The VCSEL is a low cost light source with attractive advantages such as low power consumption, high speed capabilities and wavelength tuneability. This work entails the use of traditional amplitude modulation commonly known as non-return-to-zero (NRZ) on-off keying (OOK) because of its simplicity and cost. For the MeerKAT typical distances, we show that even in a worst case scenario, the use of VCSEL on different fibres in MeerKAT distance is achievable. Using the impairment reduction approach, we successfully manage to achieve transmission distance beyond MeerKAT. Several in-line dispersion compensation mechanisms in telecommunication have been successfully employed. The work focused on the use of negative dispersion fibre to mitigate the chromatic dispersion effects in the optical fibre. The inverse dispersion fibre (IDF) is proposed for compensation in the conventional zero dispersion wavelength fibres, G. 652 that are used at the third window. Similarly, the chromatic dispersion compensation of non-zero dispersion shifted fibre (NZDSF) is experimentally demonstrated using negative dispersion submarine reduced slope (SRS), G. 655 (-). With dispersion management, we demonstrate how transmissions beyond MeerKAT baselines can be achieved error free. A systematic investigation of the use of distributed Raman amplification to overcome the attenuation losses is provided. High on-off gains of up to 15 dB, 8 dB and 5 dB for bidirectional, forward and backward pumping respectively is achieved on a 25 km Raman optimized NZDSF-Reach fibre. Combined dispersion mitigation technique and low noise distributed Raman amplification, up to about 80 km transmission was achieved on a 4 : 25 Gbps modulated VCSEL using a single pump. Using bidirectional pumping, more than 100 km of transmission was achieved error free. The high gains enhance the VCSEL transmission distance. We further suggest a novel way of using the Raman pump to distribute the clock signal while amplifying the data signal streaming the astronomical data from the remote placed telescope receivers. In summary, the work presented in this thesis has demonstrated the potential use of VCSEL technology for data collection in the telescope array. We have studied the optical effects and mitigation so as to improve the clock and data transmission. This work is relevant and valuable in providing SKA with VCSELs, an option for extremely high network performance at reasonable costs...|$|E
