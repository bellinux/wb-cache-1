5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} is {{a recent}} innovation, consisting of some combination of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like docetaxel), doxorubicin (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly cisplatin and carboplatin). Adjuvant chemotherapy {{has been found to}} increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the <b>blood,</b> <b>and</b> gastrointestinal problems.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in Khartoum State during April to June 2005. The blood pressure, <b>blood</b> glucose <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> {{cholesterol}} in smokers were measured. Fourty healthy males, their ages in range of 18 – 35 years were included in this study all of them were smokers. Two samples were taken from each smoker, one before the smoking as control and the other was taken 30 minutes after smoking of one cigarette to estimate the effect of smoking on the <b>blood</b> glucose <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> cholesterol. For blood pressure, also it was measured before the smoking and 30 minutes after the smoking of one cigarette. The results of the study showed that there was a significant increase in systolic <b>blood</b> pressure <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> glucose after the smoking but there was no significant increase in diastolic <b>blood</b> pressure <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> cholesterol...|$|R
5|$|Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, may {{go through}} {{up to seven}} nymphal stages (instars), {{requiring}} a meal of blood each time. Their life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs {{over the course of}} her lifetime. Larvae feed very quickly and detach to molt into nymphs. Both male and female adults feed on <b>blood,</b> <b>and</b> they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process which is unique to argasid ticks.|$|E

40|$|The key {{question}} {{addressed in this}} paper is whether geographical differences in <b>blood</b> donation <b>and</b> philanthropy reflect differences in social capital. We do find considerable spatial variation in <b>blood</b> donation <b>and</b> philanthropy between municipalities in the Netherlands. But we do not find that <b>blood</b> donation <b>and</b> philanthropy have strong or even moderately positive relations with each other or with indicators of prosocial norms and engagement in voluntary associations. However, voter turnout is strongly related to both <b>blood</b> donation <b>and</b> philanthropy. We conclude that the spatial variation in <b>blood</b> donation <b>and</b> philanthropy is not {{due to differences in}} social capital. ...|$|R

The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Cytochemical {{stains on}} <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> bone marrow smears are helpful in the {{distinction}} of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. The combination of a myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or Sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E
