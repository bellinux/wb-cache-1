5|$|St. Clair {{continued}} his preparations for invading the northwest {{despite the fact}} that, <b>by</b> <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> admitted he was unfit for combat due to his ill health. Like Harmar, he was also unpopular in Kentucky, and Scott had to conduct a draft to raise the militiamen needed for St. Clair's expedition. He and most other officers in Kentucky claimed they were too ill to lead the men; most actually feared losing the respect of Kentuckians through their association with St. Clair. Colonel William Oldham was the highest-ranking soldier willing to lead the Kentuckians.|$|E
5|$|Ueshiba {{moved to}} Tokyo in 1926, where {{he set up}} the Aikikai Hombu Dojo. <b>By</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> was {{comparatively}} famous in martial arts circles, and taught at this dojo and others around Japan, including in several military academies. In the aftermath of World War II the Hombu dojo was temporarily closed, but Ueshiba had by this point left Tokyo and retired to Iwama, and he continued training at the dojo he had set up there. From {{the end of the}} war until the 1960s, he worked to promote aikido throughout Japan and abroad. He died from liver cancer in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Although his new club {{began the}} 2001–02 season strongly, topping the First Division table and looking well placed for regaining the Premier League place that the club had last {{held in the}} 1997–98 season, Bruce {{tendered}} his resignation {{less than three months}} into the season in order to return to Birmingham City as manager. Although he was initially prevented from doing so by an injunction taken out by Crystal Palace, he was eventually allowed to join the Midlands-based club after a compensation package was agreed. <b>By</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> had acquired a reputation as a manager who rarely held down a job for a significant length of time.|$|E

5|$|Matilda and Henry {{remained}} childless, {{but neither}} party {{was considered to}} be infertile and contemporary chroniclers blamed their situation on the Emperor and his sins against the Church. In early 1122, the couple travelled down the Rhine together as Henry continued to suppress the ongoing political unrest, but <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> was suffering from cancer. His condition worsened and he died on 23 May 1125 in Utrecht, leaving Matilda in the protection of their nephew Frederick, the heir to his estates. Before his death, he left the imperial insignia in the control of Matilda, but it is unclear what instructions he gave her {{about the future of the}} Empire, which faced another leadership election. Archbishop Adalbert subsequently convinced Matilda that she should give him the insignia, and the Archbishop led the electoral process which appointed Lothair of Supplinburg, a former enemy of Henry, as the new King of the Romans.|$|E
5|$|By mid-January Captain García de Paredes {{had arrived}} at the advance portion of the Camino Real at Chuntuki. <b>By</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> only had 90 {{soldiers}} plus labourers and porters. Captain Pedro de Zubiaur, García’s senior officer, arrived at Lake Petén Itza with 60 musketeers, two Franciscans, and allied Yucatec Maya warriors. They were also accompanied by about 40 Maya porters. They were approached by about 300 canoes carrying approximately 2,000 Itza warriors. The warriors began to mingle freely with the Spanish party and a scuffle then broke out; a dozen of the Spanish party were forced into canoes, and three of them were killed. At this point the Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners, who included the two Franciscans. The Spanish party retreated from the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were surrounded by thousands of Itza warriors. Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas. Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered, the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki, abandoning their captured companions to their fate.|$|E
5|$|In May 1955, Edwards was {{selected}} for the England squad which travelled to mainland Europe for matches against France, Portugal and Spain, starting all three matches. Upon returning from the tour, he began a two-year stint in the British Army with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. Army service was compulsory at the time for all men of his age under the National Service scheme. He was stationed at Nesscliffe near Shrewsbury along with team-mate Bobby Charlton, but was allowed leave to play for United. He also took part in army matches, and in one season played nearly one hundred matches in total. In the 1955–56 season, despite missing nearly two months of action due to a severe bout of influenza, Edwards played 33 times as United won the championship of the Football League {{by a margin of}} 11 points from Blackpool. The following season, he made 34 league appearances, taking his total past the 100 mark, as United won a second consecutive league title, and was also in the team that contested the 1957 FA Cup Final, in which United missed out on the Double after a 2–1 defeat to Aston Villa. He also made seven appearances during United's first ever foray into the European Cup, including a 10–0 win over Anderlecht which remains the club's biggest ever margin of victory. <b>By</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> was also a regular in the England team, featuring in all four of England's qualifying matches for the 1958 World Cup and scoring two goals in the 5–2 win over Denmark on 5 December 1956. He was expected to be a key player for England in the World Cup finals, and was seen as a likely candidate to replace the veteran Billy Wright as national team captain.|$|E

5|$|Kan Ek' {{had sent}} emissaries to Mérida in December 1695 to inform Martín de Ursúa that the Itza would peacefully submit to Spanish rule. By mid-January captain García de Paredes had {{advanced}} from B'atkab' to the advance {{portion of the}} Camino Real at Chuntuki. <b>By</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> only had 90 soldiers plus labourers and porters, with many of his soldiers deserting as the force advanced towards Lake Petén Itzá; they were further delayed by the necessity of building an oar-powered longboat (or piragua) to cross the San Pedro River. Soon after Avendaño's flight eastward from Nojpetén, a group of 60 Maya warriors entered Chuntuki in full warpaint and bearing weapons; they {{claimed to have been}} sent by Avendaño to collect religious regalia and another friar. This was not the case, and they were almost certainly a scouting party sent by the Kowoj and their Chak'an Itza allies to see what progress the Spanish army was making along the road. They spoke with García and then rapidly departed without taking any of the items that they had supposedly been sent to collect. García despatched two Kejache scouts to the lakeshore to discover Avendaño's whereabouts; at the same time Avendaño's Kejache guides were returning to Chuntuki from Nojpetén with news of Avendaño's flight. The Itzas at the lake handed over an open letter written by Avendaño before his departure from Nojpetén as a token of friendship between the Itza and the Spanish. Friar Juan de San Buenaventura was enthused by the letter and wished to travel on to Nojpetén himself.|$|E

25|$|His next {{successful}} {{claim was}} against a Spad on 26 August. He was victorious {{three more times}} {{during the last few}} days of the month. His winning string continued into September with four more victims joining his list, the last on 14 September. <b>By</b> <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> had 16 accredited claims. He was awarded the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern on the 19th.|$|E

So he’s about eighty, {{and all the time}} he’s just been piling on more muscles and getting more wrinkled, and ever more set in his ways and bitter and anachronistic.

25|$|The FA Cup success {{would become}} {{the first of three}} {{successful}} Wembley finals in as many years for Moore. In 1965, he lifted the European Cup Winners Cup after West Ham defeated 1860 Munich 2–0 in the final with both goals coming from Alan Sealey. <b>By</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> was the first choice captain for England with 30 caps, and around whom Ramsey was building a team to prove correct his prediction that they would win the 1966 World Cup.|$|E

25|$|By {{this point}} Hamilton was well-honoured. However, <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> {{supported}} eugenics. He heard {{a story that}} HIV had been created from an accident with a polio vaccine, which it was thought could have been contaminated with a chimp virus. This supported his idea that modern medicine could be negative, as he thought medicine opposed {{the logic of the}} genes. So he travelled to eastern Congo to look for the virus, amid the murder and chaos. He died, and later research disproved the idea that HIV had come from a medical accident.|$|E
25|$|During 1968–1969, Tyrannosaurus Rex {{had become}} a modest success on radio and on record, and they {{released}} three albums, the third of which, Unicorn, came {{within striking distance of}} the UK Top 10 Albums. While Bolan's early solo material was rock and roll-influenced pop music, <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> was writing dramatic and baroque songs with lush melodies and surreal lyrics filled with Greek and Persian mythology as well as poetic creations of his own. The band became regulars on Peel Sessions on BBC radio, and toured Britain's student union halls.|$|E

Gort knew that the ports needed to supply such a foothold were already being threatened. That same day, the 2nd Panzer Division had assaulted Boulogne. The British garrison there surrendered on 25 May, although 4,286 men were evacuated by Royal Navy ships. The RAF also provided air cover, denying the Luftwaffe an opportunity to attack the shipping.|$|E

Although better suited for air-to-air combat than the C.1, it still suffered three major disadvantages: the pilot's vision was partially obstructed; the single machine gun was not synchronized to fire through the propeller arc, and it was a difficult craft to fly because it was easy to spin at any altitude. Aiming and firing a gun mounted above and ahead of the pilot was more difficult than simply aiming the airplane at the enemy and firing a synchronized gun.|$|E

He {{is by no means}} a young man <b>by</b> <b>now</b> and <b>he...</b> played a tremendous level of opposition.
