40|$|The {{landscape}} of the <b>baby</b> <b>food</b> industry in the United States has evolved significantly in recent years. Demand for organic <b>baby</b> <b>food</b> continues to grow rapidly, and in addition, non-GM labels, and the new packaging innovation, pouch, are very popular among <b>baby</b> <b>food</b> consumers. Previous studies on <b>baby</b> <b>food</b> have been focused on determining the consumers' willingness {{to pay for the}} organic and other nutrition attributes. This study firstly uses hedonic pricing model to investigate the premiums that purchasers {{are willing to pay for}} the organic label, the non-GM label, and the pouch packaging. Second, I use a Tobit regression to explore the relationships between the organic, non-GM, pouch <b>baby</b> <b>food</b> purchasing shares and household characteristics and purchasers' shopping behavior. The results from the hedonic pricing model show that <b>baby</b> <b>food</b> purchasers paid a premium of 2. 6 cents per ounce for the organic label, and 2. 9 cents per ounce for non-GM label. It is interesting to see that the price premium for the non-GM was higher than organic. And <b>baby</b> <b>food</b> purchasers paid a premium of 13. 8 cents per ounce for the new pouch packaging compared with the plastic tub packaging. The results from the Tobit regression models show that younger purchasers, those with high incomes, those with fewer children, and those with more free time are more likely to purchase organic and non-GM <b>baby</b> <b>food.</b> Higher education would increase consumers' preference for organic <b>baby</b> <b>food,</b> but has no significant effects on consumers' preference for non-GM <b>baby</b> <b>food.</b> In terms of geographic factors, consumers from the Pacific region have strong preference for both organic and non-GM <b>baby</b> <b>food.</b> iii 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|R

25|$|As infants grow, food {{supplements}} are added. Many parents choose commercial, ready-made <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> to supplement breast milk or formula for the child, while others adapt their usual meals for the dietary {{needs of their}} child. Whole cow's milk can be used at one year, but lower-fat milk is not recommended until the child is 2 to 3 years old. Weaning is the process through which breast milk is eliminated from the infant's diet through the introduction of solid foods in exchange for milk. Until they are toilet-trained, infants in industrialized countries wear diapers. The transition from diapers to cloth undergarments is an important transition {{in the development of}} an infant/baby to that of a toddler. Children need more sleep than adults—up to 18 hours for newborn babies, with a declining rate as the child ages. Until babies learn to walk, they are carried in the arms, held in slings or baby carriers, or transported in baby carriages or strollers. Most industrialized countries have laws requiring child safety seats for babies in motor vehicles.|$|E

In addition, there are infant formulas using soybean as a protein source in place of cow's milk (mostly in the United States and Great Britain) and formulas using protein hydrolysed into its component amino acids for infants who are allergic to other proteins.

The residue levels and detection rates of BDE 47 in the <b>baby</b> <b>food</b> samples showed a gradual increasing trend with an increase in infant ages, due to changes in the food ingredients from hypoallergenic to greasy.
