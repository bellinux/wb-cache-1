The shooting was the second firearm-related incident on Pine Middle School grounds in two weeks, with the previous incident <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> brandishing a gun towards the campus.

5|$|During the war the Wallenberg bank, Stockholms Enskilda Bank {{collaborated with}} the German government. The Secretary of the US Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. {{considered}} Jacob Wallenberg strongly pro-German, and in 1945 the US Federal Bureau of Investigation subjected the Bank to a blockade from engaging in business in the United States that was only lifted in 1947. Author Alan Lelchuk who interviewed, amongst others, Wallenberg's KGB interrogator, has speculated that the more powerful of the family may {{have chosen not to}} use their influence to locate Raoul as it could have drawn attention to their misdeeds, and they may have considered him an embarrassment, not only for <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of morality, but his possible homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{approaches}} Alistair as {{a fellow}} man of science, who is replacing components that form a time machine that he has constructed within his body. Walter professes that Alistair's attempt to jump back several months would require {{a great deal more}} power than Alistair has predicted, possibly killing hundreds in the area near where he appears. Alistair, aware of this, recalls an empty field where he was at, a few blocks from where his fiancée died, and plans to use this field where only the vegetation will die out from his arrival. Walter tells Alistair how to correct the mistake that caused him to jump to the train but warns him of the other consequences that changing events will bring, explaining that stealing Peter from the parallel universe has left him wracked with regret. Despite <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of science, Walter's torment over the years drove him to believe in a higher power, and he hopes for a sign of God's forgiveness—and thus, eventually, Peter's—in the form of a white tulip.|$|E

5000|$|For example, an {{intensional}} {{definition of the}} word [...] "bachelor" [...] is [...] "unmarried man". This definition is valid because <b>being</b> <b>an</b> unmarried <b>man</b> is both <b>a</b> necessary condition and a sufficient condition for <b>being</b> <b>a</b> bachelor: it is necessary because one cannot be <b>a</b> bachelor without <b>being</b> <b>an</b> unmarried <b>man,</b> and it is sufficient because any unmarried <b>man</b> is <b>a</b> bachelor.|$|R

Krapp and Croker share some similarities: both have failed literary aspirations, failed love lives and suffer ill health. Both are alone and approaching death.|$|E
25|$|The {{appointment}} of Mohammad Khodabanda was supported {{and approved by}} Pari Khan Khanum, due to him <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of old age, almost blind, and pleasure-seeking.

She made an agreement with the Qizilbash chieftains that Mohammad Khodabanda would remain shah in name, whilst her and her envoys would continue controlling the interests of the state.|$|E

25|$|In 1882, Moore {{sold the}} Gertrude {{and built the}} Pacific Slope, {{but by the end}} of the year, he had fallen on hard times again and sold the Pacific Slope to Andrew Onderdonk and {{declared}} bankruptcy again, losing not only his sternwheelers, but also his home and properties in Victoria. John Irving purchased the Western Slope at auction, and <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of great honor, hired Billie to be her captain, Henry her mate and John her purser, thus helping his rival's family remain solvent. William Moore, now 60, was hardly ready to become an employee of his old rival's 28-year-old son, so he built another sternwheeler, the Teaser, which was eventually seized by creditors (despite Billie's attempt to hide her in Alaska), and sold and renamed the Rainbow.|$|E

He won his first ODI Man of the Match award for the 46 runs scored in the low scoring third game of the series. He top scored for India in the Standard Bank International One-Day Series 1996/97 in South Africa with 280 runs from eight games at an average of 35.00 and a strike rate of 60.73, the highlight <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> of the Match award winning performance (84 runs, one catch) in the Final of the series that came in a losing cause.

500|$|Mandela {{was very}} {{self-conscious}} about <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> and regularly made references to manhood. He was heterosexual, and biographer Fatima Meer {{said that he}} was [...] "easily tempted" [...] by women. Another biographer, Martin Meredith, characterised him as being [...] "by nature a romantic", highlighting that he had relationships with various women. Mandela was married three times, fathered six children, and had seventeen grandchildren and at least seventeen great-grandchildren. He could be stern and demanding of his children, although he was more affectionate with his grandchildren. His first marriage was to Evelyn Ntoko Mase in October 1944; they divorced after 13 years in 1957 under the multiple strains of his adultery and constant absences, devotion to revolutionary agitation, {{and the fact that she}} was a Jehovah's Witness, a religion requiring political neutrality. Mandela's second wife was the social worker Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, although they divorced in 1995. Mandela married his third wife, Graça Machel, on his 80th birthday in 1998.|$|E
500|$|Such was her {{domination}} of the sport that there were persistent rumours that she was actually a man. These first surfaced immediately after her first match, when {{the members of the}} opposition Ottawa side accused her of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> The accusation was not unfounded in the league, where it was not uncommon for boys to be disguised as women to improve the spectacle. Some opposition teams went as far as removing Lapensée's hat during games to check how long her hair was. Her father made a public statement that the claims were false, and in February 1916, the Montreal Star investigated the claims. The reporter spoke to [...] "dozens and dozens of people from Cornwall who had known her since she was little", and concluded that [...] "from what he learned he is thoroughly convinced 'he' is a 'she'." [...] Despite this the rumours lingered, and some modern sources still speculate that she might have been a man. In 2011, an article in the Cornwall Standard Freeholder claimed that [...] "we'll never know if Albertine was actually an Albert", suggesting the possibility that Lapensée was actually a draft dodger named Albert.|$|E
