5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, baby carrots or mini-carrots (carrots {{that have been}} {{peeled and cut into}} uniform cylinders) have been a popular ready-to-eat snack food {{available}} in many supermarkets.

5|$|Premastication, pre-chewing, or kiss feeding is the act {{of chewing}} food {{for the purpose of}} {{physically}} breaking it down in order to feed another that is incapable of masticating the food by themselves.

The chewed food {{in the form of a}} bolus is transferred from the mouth of one individual to another, either directly mouth-to-mouth, via utensils, hands, or is further cooked or processed prior to feeding.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the current levels of nitrates in <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> marketed in Lisbon, Portugal to estimate the toxicological risk associated with their intake. The nitrate content was determined in bottled <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> of four varieties: vegetable-based foods, meat-based foods, fish-based foods, and fruit-based foods. A total of 39 samples were analyzed over the period 2010 – 2011. Average and median levels of nitrate in <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> were lower than the maximum limits established by European Union legislation (200  mg kg− 1).

The family {{remained}} in Finland, a former Grand Duchy under Russian rule, which had declared its independence in December 1917. They hoped that the White Russians would prevail. They gradually ran out of supplies and had to beg for help from family. In July 1918, Victoria wrote to her first cousin, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, begging her to send <b>baby</b> <b>food</b> so she could feed Vladimir.

40|$|Processed <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> {{designed}} for infants (4 - 12 months) and toddlers (12 - 36 months) (excluding infant formula, follow-on formula, the so-called growing-up milks, and cereal-based foods for infants), which am {{referred to as}} <b>baby</b> <b>foods,</b> are specific products defined by a European regulation (Directive 2006 / 125 /CE). According to this Directive, such foods have a composition adapted to the nutritional needs of children of this age and should comply with specifications related to food safety in terms of ingredients, production processes, and prevention of infectious and toxicological hazards. Hence, they differ from ordinary foods and from non-specific processed foods. This market segment includes {{the full range of}} foods that can be part of children's diet: dairy products (dairy desserts, yoghurts, and fresh cheese), sweet products (nondairy desserts, fruit, and drinks), and salty products (soups, vegetable-based foods, meat, fish, and full dishes). This market amounted to 89, 666 MT in France in 2011 and 83, 055 MT in 2010 (a total of 325, 524 MT in the 27 countries of the European Union in 2010, including 90, 438 MT in Germany, 49, 144 MT in Spain, and 40, 438 MT in Italy). The consumption of <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> in France varies with infant age and parental choice. <b>Baby</b> <b>foods</b> account for 7 % of total energy intake at 4 - 5 months, 28 % at 6 - 7 months, 27 % at 8 - 11 months, 17 % at 1 - 17 months, and 11 % at 18 - 24 months. Among parents, 24 % never offer their children any <b>baby</b> <b>foods,</b> 13 % do so 1 - 3 days/week and 63 % 4 - 7 days/week. Among consumers, 55 % of children eat more than 250 g/day of <b>baby</b> <b>foods.</b> As <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> only account for a minor fraction of overall food intake, their impact on the quality of young children's diet is much less than that of growing-up milks, particularly for preventing insufficient iron and vitamin D intake. Their consumption, however, has an indirect benefit on the nutritional quality of the diet and on food safety, particularly regarding toxicological hazards, as it postpones the introduction of non-specific processed foods, which are inadequate for this age group owing to both their nutritional composition and lower <b>food</b> safety control. <b>Baby</b> <b>foods</b> represent a family of products meeting parents' expectations and adapted to infants and young children. They are clearly beneficial in terms of food safety, but the nutritional benefit to be expected from their consumption is minimal: their main advantage is postponing or decreasing the consumption of non-specific industrially processed foods...|$|R

25|$|Genie's father fed Genie {{as little}} as {{possible}} and refused to give her solid food, feeding her only <b>baby</b> <b>food,</b> cereal, Pablum, an occasional soft-boiled egg, and liquids. Her father, or when coerced her brother, spooned food into her mouth as quickly as possible, and if she choked or could not swallow fast enough the person feeding her rubbed her face in her food. These were normally the only times he allowed his wife to be with Genie, although she could not feed Genie herself. Genie's mother claimed her husband always fed Genie three times a day but also said that Genie sometimes risked a beating by making noise when hungry, leading researchers to believe he often refused to feed her. In early 1972 Genie's mother told researchers that at night, when possible, at around 11 PM she surreptitiously tried to give Genie additional food, causing Genie to develop an abnormal sleep pattern in which she slept from 7 to 11 PM, woke up for a few minutes, and fell back asleep for an additional 6 hours. This pattern continued for several months after removal from captivity.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{assessment}} of acute and chronic dietary exposure to contaminants in <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> {{is needed to}} ensure healthy infant growth. Monthly EU market baskets of commercial <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> were designed for the first 9 months of life by the "babyfood" study group of the CASCADE Network of Excellence for the specific purpose of assessing exposure to potentially toxic substances in infants fed with such foods. The present paper reports the different steps {{that led to the}} preparation of monthly pooled samples of commercial <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> ("Infant formulae and follow-on formulae", and "Other baby foods") that may constitute the extreme case of the diet for an infant that would not be breast fed at all. Several market baskets were generated for an "average EU infant" and for infants of 4 selected countries (Italy, Sweden, Spain and Slovakia), fed with either milk infant formulae, soy infant formulae or hypoallergenic infant formulae and weaned (at the 5 th month) with commercial <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> and beverages available on the EU market. Market share data of 2007 for <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> were used to design the baskets. Holding companies and the name of all their products were identified. Monthly diets for EU infants were elaborated in terms of food categories (e. g. infant cereals) of typologies of products (e. g. infant cereals without gluten) and of specific product. The number of baskets generated was 30 for "Infant formulae and follow-on formulae" (including 62 products) and 13 for "Other baby foods" (including 35 products).
