500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks about {{worshiping}} cunnilingus, with Madonna comparing oral sex to holy water, and {{as noted by}} Billboard [...] Vanessa Grigoriadis, it was named after her lifelong obsessions, since it features [...] "church-baiting innuendos," [...] "juxtaposing Christian imagery with frank sexuality". During the spoken chorus, she sings: [...] "Kiss it better, kiss it better/ Make it <b>better,</b> <b>make</b> it wetter", and later she speaks, [...] "If you like it please confess / Bless yourself and genuflect". In the hook, she claims: [...] "Don't it taste like holy water?", before clarifying: [...] "Yeezus loves my pussy best". Adam R. Holz of Plugged In noted that the song [...] "finds Madonna returning to her longstanding habit of sexing up spiritual imagery".|$|E
500|$|Development on Mega Man 3 {{began at}} Capcom {{over a year}} after the release of Mega Man 2. Akira Kitamura, the lead {{supervisor}} for the first two games quit his job at the company during that gap of time. Artist Keiji Inafune, credited as [...] "Inafking", considered Mega Man 3 as one of his least favorite entries in the series due to [...] " [...] what went into the game and what was behind the release of the game." [...] He had [...] "preset notions" [...] about successful development because of the team's good experience with Mega Man 2 and found that his new superior [...] "didn't really understand Mega Man the way his predecessor did". During the game's production, the developers lost the main planner, so Inafune had to take over that job for its completion. Inafune recalled the final two months of development as particularly turbulent, when he had to take responsibility for assessing and dividing up tasks among the team members who were not meeting deadlines. The team was forced to put Mega Man 3 on the market before they thought it was ready. Inafune concluded, [...] "I knew that if we had more time to polish it, we could {{do a lot of things}} <b>better,</b> <b>make</b> it a better game, but the company said that we needed to release it. The whole environment behind what went into the production of the game is what I least favored. Numbers one and two – I really wanted to make the games; I was so excited about them. Number three – it just turned very different." ...|$|E
500|$|The company {{contemplated}} {{purchasing the}} Argonauts of the CFL at least twice, with minority partner Tanenbaum keen {{to add the}} team to his list of franchises, but concluded that the cost and effort {{that would be required}} to make the team profitable was not worth the minimal financial upside. [...] In 2013, it was reported that the company was again considering purchasing the team and having them play at a renovated BMO Field, with the asking price reportedly $20 million, but later coming down to $10 million. [...] A vote by MLSE's board on purchasing the team was called in December 2013, but they were unable to come to an agreement on the issue. [...] On May 20, 2015 it was announced that two of the three ownership partners of MLSE, Bell Canada and Tanenbaum's Kilmer Group, had acquired ownership of the Argos, with the deal to close {{at the end of the}} year, and would move the team to BMO Field for the 2016 season. It has been speculated that Rogers was not interested in investing in the team since Bell has exclusive rights to broadcast all CFL games. It is thought that control of the Argos by MLSE will enhance Toronto's chances of acquiring an NFL franchise, with Peddie saying [...] "the NFL is telling them that if you want an NFL team, you <b>better</b> <b>make</b> sure the Argos are okay." [...] Leiweke has said that moving into a renovated BMO field [...] "will help turn [...] around" [...] and that [...] "there's no way the NFL comes here without the CFL being unbelievably successful first." ...|$|E

2500|$|From 2014-16, the White House, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of the Office of the First Lady, Michelle Obama, partnered with key school counselor educators and college access professionals nationwide to bring national focus on the key roles of school counselors and college access professionals.

The First Lady also began the <b>Better</b> <b>Make</b> Room program to focus on college access for underrepresented students, and she began hosting the American School Counselor Association's School Counselor of the Year awards ceremony at the White House. The initiatives culminated in an unprecedented collaboration among multiple major professional associations focused on school counseling and college access including the American Counseling Association, the American School Counselor Association, the National Association for College Admission Counseling, the College Board, and ACT raising the profile and prominence of the role of school counselors collaborating on college access, affordability, and admission for all students.|$|E
2500|$|My first {{innings in}} Test cricket was, {{as you might}} expect, a trying experience, but proved {{to be one of}} the best cricket lessons of my career, thanks to Ian Redpath. I came to the wicket with Australia reeling at 5/107 to join [...] "Redders", who had watched three quick wickets fall at the other end. Illingworth and Snow, sensing that one more wicket would see them through our batting line up, stepped up their attack on the senior member of our partnership. [...] "Snowy" [...] {{concentrated}} his attack short of a length on [...] "Redders" [...] off-stump, with a liberal sprinkling of shorter pitched balls for good measure. Ian made a point of not playing at anything he didn't have to and ducked or swayed away from the shorter deliveries. Each time he swayed or ducked he came back to the upright position and sneered at [...] "Snowy". It may not have looked all that pretty, but it was pretty effective as both Illingworth and Snow became more and more frustrated. Ian's example at the other end made me feel that if it meant that much to him to keep his wicket intact then I had <b>better</b> <b>make</b> sure I try just as hard at my end to keep mine intact. Fortunately we both succeeded and our partnership put us into a sound position, but from my point of view I had received an invaluable lesson in what Test match batting was all about from one of the most courageous batsmen ever to play for Australia.|$|E
