25|$|For {{much of its}} history, the {{technology}} underlying shotgun sequencing was the classical chain-termination method or 'Sanger method', {{which is based on}} the selective incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides by DNA polymerase during in vitro DNA replication. Recently, shotgun sequencing has been supplanted by high-throughput sequencing methods, especially for large-scale, automated genome analyses. However, the Sanger method remains in wide use, primarily for smaller-scale projects and for obtaining especially long contiguous DNA sequence reads (>500 nucleotides). Chain-termination methods require a single-stranded DNA template, a DNA primer, a DNA polymerase, normal deoxynucleosidetriphosphates (dNTPs), and modified nucleotides (dideoxyNTPs) that terminate DNA strand elongation. These chain-terminating nucleotides lack a 3'-OH group required for the formation of a phosphodiester bond between two nucleotides, causing DNA polymerase to cease extension of DNA when a ddNTP is incorporated. The ddNTPs may be radioactively or fluorescently labelled for detection in DNA sequencers. Typically, these machines can sequence up to 96 DNA samples in a single <b>batch</b> (<b>run)</b> in up to 48 runs a day.|$|E

50|$|Deadline is {{a special}} case of batch. A {{deadline}} run looks {{just like any other}} <b>batch</b> <b>run</b> except that a deadline time is specified on the @RUN or @START control statement. The deadline time is used in conjunction with the maximum SUPS (time estimate) on the control statement. A deadline job runs at normal batch priorities unless or until it appears that it could miss its deadline time. Then the more the mismatch between time until the deadline and remaining SUPS, the higher the priority. While deadline can’t totally shut off transactions and has no effect on real time, it can effectively shut off most other processing in the system if necessary to achieve its goal.|$|E

Wyatt used a breadboard instrument developed at SSI to confirm that light scattering could reveal bacterial effects that are not observable with a microscope. Further studies explored the efficacy of antibiotic agents on bacteria. A commercial instrument, the Differential I, was ultimately developed in an attempt to provide convenient and accurate data while still maintaining flexibility necessary in exploring this new field. In order to better test antibiotic susceptibility SSI developed the Differential III {{which was one of the}} first analytical instruments to incorporate an on board computer and utilized the first <b>batch</b> <b>run</b> of Intel’s 8008 chips.

5000|$|The largest {{unit of work}} is the [...] "Run." [...] This {{is taken}} from the factory [...] "production run" [...] {{terminology}} and generally equates to job or session on other systems.

They may include file handling, program execution, and branches of control. A <b>batch</b> <b>Run</b> is typically stored as a file and is scheduled by a [...] "Start" [...] command from within another Run or by the operator. A time sharing Run is initiated by logging in from a time-sharing terminal and inputting the @RUN command.

Security authorizations are validated based on the authenticated user-id and other information supplied on the Run control statement.|$|E
50|$|This {{procedure}} involves taking complete backups of {{all data}} {{at regular intervals}} daily, weekly, monthly, or whatever is appropriate. Multiple generations of backup are retained, often three which {{gives rise to the}} name. The most recent backup is the son, the previous the father, and the oldest backup is the grandfather. This method is commonly used for a batch transaction processing system with a magnetic tape. If the system fails during a <b>batch</b> <b>run,</b> the master file is recreated by restoring the son backup and then restarting the batch. However, if the son backup fails, is corrupted or destroyed, then the previous generation of backup (the father) is used. Likewise, if that fails, then the generation of backup previous to the father (i.e. the grandfather) is required. Of course the older the generation, the more the data may be out of date. Organize only of records that have changed. For example, a full backup could be performed weekly, and partial backups taken nightly. Recovery using this scheme involves restoring the last full backup and then restoring all partial backups in order to produce an up-to-date database. This process is quicker than taking only complete backups, at the expense of longer recovery time.|$|E

40|$|In 1999, an {{international}} standard ISO 17025 made {{the calculation of}} measurement uncertainty for all analytical test results mandatory. Little guidance was available. How to account for bias in measurement uncertainty was contentious. Many analytical chemistry sectors proposed different ways of including bias in the uncertainty estimate. Six different approaches were investigated: (i) Always correcting for bias; (ii) Correcting for bias when significant; (iii) Including the bias by quadrature with the combined measurement uncertainty; (iv) Including the bias by quadrature in the expanded measurement uncertainty; (v) Adding the bias to the expanded uncertainty to give an asymmetrical confidence interval; (vi) Adding the absolute bias to the expanded uncertainty. Each of these approaches was evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation. It was found that always correcting for bias and including {{the uncertainty of the}} correction had the best outcome. If this was not possible then correcting for significant bias performed better than most other approaches. However, clarification needed to be made on what constituted the bias of a test result. Was bias to be determined within a <b>batch</b> <b>run,</b> between a <b>batch</b> <b>run</b> or between laboratories? This question was answered by looking at interlaboratory proficiency data which showed that run bias was indeed the bias of an analytical test result and therefore a correction when necessary should be made on that basis. This run bias needed to be determined across the concentration range of the analysis. Performing a regression analysis of the trueness of the analytical <b>batch</b> <b>run</b> solved this problem. The uncertainty of this regression approach was determined and applied to experimental test data. A comparison of the different approaches was then determined and it was concluded that the uncertainty based on the run bias approach gave the most realistic estimate of the uncertainty of measurement...|$|E

Accumulated nutrients in the plants can then be removed by harvesting and anaerobically digesting the biomass. This study presents two aquatic plants (L. minor (L.) and P. stratiotes (L.)) and one microalgae species (C. vulgaris (L.)), their capacities for growth and nutrient removal in leachate from Häradsudden landfill, Sweden, are investigated. The biogas potential of the two plants is determined via anaerobic digestion in a <b>batch</b> <b>run,</b> followed by a lab-scale reactor run for L. minor only. Results show that growth in leachate directly from the landfill is not possible for the selected species, but at a leachate dilution of 50 % or more. Nutrients are removed in leachates with plants to a higher extent than in leachates without, yet the actual amounts do not differ notably between plant species. L. minor proves a better choice than P. stratiotes despite this as growth is superior for L. minor under the experimental conditions of this study. Considering biogas production, L. minor gives more methane than P. stratiotes according to the results from the <b>batch</b> <b>run.</b> The former is however not suitable for large-scale anaerobic digestion unless as an additional feedstock due to practical cultivation issues...|$|E

Polyols with different molecular weights (1100 to 6000 g mol- 1) were applied to synthesize the polymer matrix, and the agitation speed effect was used for controlling the average pore size of the investigated polyurethane foams. The physical and mechanical properties of the polymers were evaluated by standard test methods, and their morphology was identified by Scanning Electron Microscopy. The immobilization procedure efficiency was assessed by quantifying the capability of the matrices to attach the cells and the catalytic activity of the biocatalysts in both aqueous (olive oil hydrolysis) and non-aqueous media (ethanolysis of babassu oil) under single and consecutive <b>batch</b> <b>runs.</b> Although all synthesized matrices were suitable to immobilize the whole cells with high catalytic performance, a better set of parameters was attained when the polyol ether with molecular weight of 6000 g mol- 1 and 1100 g mol- 1 was used.
