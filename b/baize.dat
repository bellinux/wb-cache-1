5|$|The cap {{badge of}} the RWY is the Prince of Wales's {{feathers}} is {{a slightly different}} design to other regiments wearing the same symbol, such as the Royal Regiment of Wales. It is worn on the brown beret with a red <b>baize</b> and a black <b>baize</b> backing. During the First World War, men from the RWY carved their cap badge into the chalk hillside above the village of Fovant where it can still be seen today, alongside those of other units.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the regiment, {{in common}} with other Yeomanry and Militia units, sported a range of uniforms. Jackets were always dark blue. Between 1812 and 1873, a leather shako was worn, {{replaced}} in 1873 by a fur Busby with a red cloth bag. Service dress during the First World War was a khaki tunic and breeches, with a red stripe down the seam and a red lanyard worn by all ranks round the left armpit. The chevrons of sergeants and corporals were surmounted by a regimental badge on a red <b>baize</b> backing, a practice that continued through the inter-war years and beyond.|$|E

50|$|Holland was a {{merchant}} of the Staple, {{and probably a}} member of the Mercers' Company, London. He had partially retired when, on the suggestion of a Scottish friend, he projected the Bank of Scotland which was established by act of the Scottish parliament in 1695, {{in the name of the}} Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland. The new bank opened its first branches in 1696. Holland was elected the first governor, and ultimately possessed seventy-four shares. One of the directors was James Foulis, with whom Holland had been associated in a scheme for introducing the manufacture of Colchester <b>baizes</b> into Scotland in June 1693.|$|R
50|$|The 15th century {{meant the}} {{beginning}} of commerce development for Krosno. Apart from local trade during weekly Monday fairs the town participated in a large-scale import-export and transit commerce. The main trade routes led to the Red Ruthenia, Hungary and the countries of southern Europe. The largest transactions were made during yearly fairs held three times a year. The trade was mainly in local cloths and <b>baizes,</b> horses, cattle, copperware and imported commodities made of copper and iron, and obviously, in Hungarian wine, on which several Krosno merchant families made fortunes. The first Jews to settle in Krosno were the brothers Nechemia and Lazar of Regensburg in Germany who received special permits from the Polish King, Wladyslaw Jagiello in the 15th century.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} day, 9 September, {{the party}} visited the races, where the prince's horse won the Clumber Stakes. After dinner the prince once again {{wanted to play}} baccarat {{and asked for a}} chalk line to be drawn on the <b>baize,</b> six inches from the edge, behind which players were to keep their counters when not placing their stake. Edward was banker and Williams acted as the croupier. When Gordon-Cumming arrived at the table, there were only two vacant seats. At either of them, Gordon-Cumming would be surrounded by members of the Wilson family, all of whom had been informed of Stanley and Levett's suspicions.|$|E
25|$|The cioareci are peasant pants {{of white}} woollen cloth (dimie, pănură or aba) woven in four threads, {{therefore}} thicker than the ițari. In Banat, the cioareci {{are known as}} canvas or <b>baize</b> stockings worn by women during the winter. In Moldavia can be found cioareci without creți that are worn in the working days. Here, they are also known as bernevici.|$|E
25|$|In {{the book}} Masters of the <b>Baize,</b> a {{detailed}} comparison and ranking of snooker professionals, authors Luke Williams and Paul Gadsby rated Davis {{as the third}} greatest snooker player of all time behind Joe Davis and Stephen Hendry. Davis has won a record 81 professional titles and was the runner-up in 37 events. 28 of these titles were in ranking events. His record of six world titles {{in the modern era}} has been bettered only by Hendry and no player has yet matched his tally of six UK titles. Davis has also compiled over 300 competitive centuries during his career. In 2011 he was inducted to World Snooker's newly created Hall of Fame along with seven former World Champions.|$|E

The property is much sub-divided.The Manor was given by Ethelred to the See of Canterbury; and belongs now to the corporation of {{the sons of the}} clergy. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Rochester. Value: £923. Patron: the Archbishop of Canterbury. The church is early English, had anciently 3 altars and 5 chantries, and contains some monuments and 2 brasses. There are: an Independent chapel, much improved in 1869; a charity school, with £50; and other charities, with £172.Dr. Dale, the author of 'Pharmacologia', was a native.The sub-district contains 5 parishes.

25|$|In both {{town and}} country, {{means of access}} between the main house and the servant's wings were kept to a minimum, often the single door would be lined with green <b>baize</b> to deaden any sound. Long and {{complicated}} passages linking kitchens with dining rooms were devised; in some houses the tortuous route through corridors and staircases from kitchen to dining room could be an eighth of a mile – an absence of cooking smells taking priority over hot food. Even the doors linking to the connecting corridors would be covered by screens, sometimes disguised as bookcases with dummy books, or just simply covered in the same wallpaper as that with which the room was decorated, as the existence of servants {{was not to be}} acknowledged. Cleaning had to be performed {{in the early hours of}} the morning while the employers were asleep, and in the grander houses only male servants were allowed to be visible, and then only when required.|$|E
500|$|Cloth {{has been}} used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century. The {{predecessor}} company of the most famous maker of billiard cloth, Iwan Simonis, was formed in 1453. Most cloth made for carom billiards tables is a type of <b>baize</b> that is dyed green, and is made from 100% worsted wool, which provides a very fast surface allowing the balls to travel with little resistance across the table [...] The green color of cloth was originally chosen to emulate the look of grass, and has been so colored since the 16th century. However, as in green eyeshades, the color also serves a useful function: Humans have a higher light sensitivity to green than to any other color, so green cloth permits play {{for longer periods of time}} without eye strain.|$|E
500|$|Performances usually {{began at}} 3pm to take {{advantage}} of the daylight: the main floor for the audience, the pit, had no roof in order to let in the light. A glazed dome was built over the opening, but according to one of Pepys' diary entries, the dome was not entirely effective at keeping out the elements: he and his wife were forced to leave the theatre to take refuge from a hail storm. Green <b>baize</b> cloth covered the benches in the pit and served to decorate the boxes, additionally ornamented with gold-tooled leather, and even the stage itself. The backless green benches in the pit were in a semicircular arrangement facing the stage, according to a May 1663 letter from one Monsieur de Maonconys: [...] "All benches of the pit, where people of rank also sit, are shaped in a semi-circle, each row higher than the next." [...] The three galleries formed a semicircle around the floor seats; both the first and second galleries were divided up into boxes.|$|E
500|$|Hugh I'Anson Fausset, {{writing in}} The Manchester Guardian, thought that Casino Royale was [...] "a first-rate thriller... with a breathtaking plot". Although he {{considered}} the book to be [...] "schoolboy stuff", he felt the novel was [...] "galvanised into life by the hard brilliance of the telling". Alan Ross, writing in The Times Literary Supplement wrote that Casino Royale was [...] "an extremely engaging affair", and that [...] "the especial charm... is the high poetry with which he invests the green <b>baize</b> lagoons of the casino tables". He concluded that the book was [...] "both exciting and extremely civilized". Reviewing for The Listener, Simon Raven believed that Fleming was a [...] "kind of supersonic John Buchan", but he was somewhat dismissive of the plot, observing that it is [...] "a brilliant but improbable notion" [...] that includes [...] "a deal of champagne-drinking, bomb-throwing, relentless pitting of wits etc... with a cretinous love-affair". Raven also dismissed Bond as an [...] "infantile" [...] creation, but did allow that [...] "Fleming tells a good story with strength and distinction... his creation of a scene, both visually and emotionally, is of a very high order indeed." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the game}} began Gordon-Cumming {{discussed}} the tapestry with Wilson, commenting {{that the different}} colours of the cloth {{made it difficult to}} see the counters; Gordon-Cumming put a piece of white paper in front of him on which to place his now highly-visible stake. Although many of the inexperienced party were playing for small stakes, Gordon-Cumming was betting between £5 and £25 for a coup; he played the [...] system of betting, in which if he won a hand with a £5 stake, he would add his winnings to the stake, together with another £5, as the stake for the next hand. Soon after play began Stanley Wilson thought he saw Gordon-Cumming add two red £5 counters onto his stake after the hand had finished, but before the stake had been paid—a method of cheating known in casinos as after he thought that this had happened a second time, Wilson turned to Levett and, according to the later court transcripts, whispered [...] "My God, Berkeley, this is too hot!" [...] further explaining that [...] "the man next to me is cheating!" [...] After Levett also watched for a few minutes, he agreed, saying to Wilson [...] "this is too hot". After half an hour the game was completed and the prince congratulated Gordon-Cumming on his play; the future king also asked Mrs Wilson for a more suitable table for the following day. Stanley Wilson instructed the butler to move a longer, three-foot wide table in and cover it with green <b>baize.</b> Wilson then discussed the cheating with Levett. The two men were uncertain what steps to take, and agreed that Stanley would ask his brother-in-law, Lycett Green, for his advice. Although Lycett Green thought it impossible that Gordon-Cumming would have cheated, Stanley told him that he was certain, as was Levett.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the late}} 17th century onwards Leiden slumped, mainly {{due to the}} decline of the cloth industries. In the {{beginning}} of the 19th century the <b>baize</b> manufacture was altogether given up, although industry remained central to Leiden economy. This decline is painted vividly by the fall in population. The population of Leiden had sunk to 30,000 between 1796 and 1811, and in 1904 was 56,044.|$|E
2500|$|Leiden {{flourished in}} the 16th and 17th century. At {{the close of the}} 15th century the weaving establishments (mainly broadcloth) of Leiden were very important, and after the {{expulsion}} of the Spaniards Leiden cloth, Leiden <b>baize</b> and Leiden camlet were familiar terms. [...] In the same period, Leiden developed an important printing and publishing industry. The influential printer Christoffel Plantijn lived there at one time. One of his pupils was Lodewijk Elzevir (1547–1617), who established the largest bookshop and printing works in Leiden, a business continued by his descendants through 1712 and the name subsequently adopted (in a variant spelling) by contemporary publisher Elsevier.|$|E
2500|$|Snooker ( [...] , [...] ) is a cue sport which {{originated}} among British Army {{officers in}} Etawah, India {{in the latter}} half of the 19th century. It is played on a rectangular table covered with a green cloth, or <b>baize,</b> with pockets at each of the four corners and in the middle of each long side. Using a cue and 22 coloured balls, players must strike the white ball (or [...] "cue ball") to pot the remaining balls in the correct sequence, accumulating points for each pot. An individual game, or frame, is won by the player who scores the most points. A match is won when a player wins a predetermined number of frames.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time as the major {{disruption}} to the social and religious life of the townspeople took place in the 1540s, the introduction of the spinning wheel and the importation of newer fabrics from the continent led to a fall in the manufacture of broadcloth. Clare recovered some of its industry in the late 16th century, by taking up what is called the 'New Draperies', lighter and cheaper cloths called 'bays and says'. [...] 'A bay was lighter and finer than modern <b>baize....</b> A say was a fine durable cloth, made entirely of wool with a texture resembling serge'. By the 18th century this industry was in decline, becoming concentrated in the larger towns, Ipswich and Colchester. At the close of the 16th century, Sir Robert Jermyn described Clare as '... a populous market town [...] requires an able, painful and discreet teacher ...' in a letter to Robert Cecil requesting the appointment of a 'Mr Colte' as the town's new pastor.|$|E
2500|$|The fully wool cloth {{is usually}} green, with a {{directional}} nap {{running from the}} baulk {{end of the table}} towards the end with the black ball spot. The cloth is often called [...] "baize"; however <b>baize</b> is a much inferior type of cloth sometimes used on pool tables. The nap will affect the direction of the cue ball depending on which direction the cue ball is shot and also on whether left or right side (spin) is placed on the ball. Even if the cue ball is hit in exactly the same way, the nap will cause a different effect depending on whether the ball is hit down table (towards the black ball spot) or up table towards the baulk line. The cloth on a snooker table is not vacuumed, as this can destroy the nap. The cloth is brushed in a straight line from the baulk end to the far end with multiple brush strokes that are straight in direction (i.e. not across the table). Some table men will also then drag a dampened cloth wrapped around a short piece of board (like a two by four), or straight back of a brush to collect any remaining fine dust and help lay the nap down. The table is then ironed. Strachan cloth as used in official snooker tournaments is made up of 100% wool. Some other cloths include a small percentage of nylon.|$|E
2500|$|The enslaved {{people wanted}} peace {{and did not}} want war. They came up with a {{proposal}} that would serve as a peace offering among their master and all of his enslaved people. The terms were outlined as such: Enslaved people are to be given Fridays and Saturdays to work for themselves and these two days are not to be subtracted or counted as Saint's days. Furthermore, they must be given casting nets and canoes for survival. Slaves are also not obliged to fish in tidal pools or gather shellfish and if the master wishes to eat shellfish, the slaves asked to send your mina blacks. The proposal also stated the request of making a large boat so that when it goes to Bahia, the slaves can place their cargoes aboard and not pay freightage of carrying the goods in bulks. In addition, in the planting of manioc, they requested that the men to have a daily quota of two and a half hands and for the women, two hands. For manioc four, the daily quota must be five level alqueires or also equivalent to 36.27 litres in dry measure. The daily quota for sugarcane was set to five hands rather than six and with ten canes in each bundle. Next, on the boats it was stated that there are to be four poles, and one pole for the rudder to steer the ship, and the one at the rudder must work hard for the slaves. Upon that request, the wood that is sawed using a hand saw must have three men below and one men above. The following on the list was that the measure of firewood had to be practiced here, and for each measure a woodcutter and a woman had to be the wood carrier. The peace proposal also stated that they did not want the present oversees and to choose new ones with the approval of the slaves first. In the proposal, it was also written that at the milling rollers there has to be four women to feed in the cane, two pulleys, and a carcanha. Also, at each cauldron or pot there must be a person to tend the fire and this also must apply to each series of kettles. On Saturdays, there must be no work at all in the mill without fail. On top of that, sailors that go in the launch beside the <b>baize</b> shirt, must be provided with a jacket <b>baize</b> and with all other necessary clothing. The slaves agreed to go and work the canefield of Jabirú but it must remain as a pasture as they would not cut cane in the swamp. The terms also pointed out that the slaves are to be allowed to plant rice wherever they want and in any marsh, without needing to ask permission. Each slave is also allowed to cut jacaranda or any other wood without having to be accounted for it. The proposal concluded with saying that by accepting all the terms stated in the proposal and always allowing the slaves to possess the hardware, they would be ready to serve the master just as they did before but {{they do not want to}} continue living the bad customs like how it was in the other engenhos or known as sugar cane mills and facilities. Their last request was that they are to be able to play, relax and sing at any time they wished to do so without being hindered and that asking permission was not needed to do any of that.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Bogdanov's 1978 RSC {{production}} at the Aldwych Theatre, starring Jonathan Pryce and Paola Dionisotti. In this modern dress production, after the house lights went down, nothing happened on stage for a moment. Then, a commotion arose from within the audience. The house lights came back on, {{and a member of}} the audience (Pryce) is seen to be in altercation with an usherette (Dionisotti). After pushing the usherette to the ground, the man then clambered onto the stage, and began to smash parts of the set before being restrained by the usherette and theatre staff, stripped and thrown into a bath. The subsequent play was then presented as his dream. At several performances of the play, audience members were duped into thinking the fight between the man and the usherette was real, and several times, other audience members attempted to intervene in the conflict. This production very much embraced a feminist reading of the play, presenting the taming as a distasteful display of male chauvinism, with the process presented as Sly's dream of male domination and power over the usherette who had restrained him. In this version, Katherina delivers the final speech (with the men sitting not at a dining table but a poker table) in a toneless, lifeless voice, and although Petruchio appeared thoroughly ashamed of what he had done to her, he still collected his winnings from the other men before leaving. Dionisotti's own feelings about her delivery of the speech was that it was [...] "full of affection for women." [...] She also felt the production had a very bleak ending; [...] "the last image was of two very lonely people. The lights went down as we left - I following him, the others hardly noticing we'd gone. They'd got down to some hard gambling. They just closed ranks around the green <b>baize</b> table." [...] Michael Billington was especially complementary, praising Bogdanov for the honesty shown in [...] "his approach to this barbaric and disgusting play [...] Instead of softening its harsh edges like most recent directors, he has chosen to emphasise its moral and physical ugliness." [...] Graham Holderness argues of this production, [...] "Bogdanov was concerned to stress the continuities between the mercantile ethics of Renaissance Padua and the commercial values of modern-day British capitalism; between the oppression of women in Shakespeare's time, and the continuing exploitation of sex today; between the class-divisions of the sixteenth century and the economic inequality of the twentieth." ...|$|E
