5|$|We're glad to {{see this}} {{short-lived}} debacle has prompted renewed interest and debate over net neutrality and Internet censorship—two very important issues that don't get nearly enough attention—so perhaps this was all just a <b>blessing</b> <b>in</b> disguise.|$|E
5|$|The longer 7.5cm {{guns were}} a mixed <b>blessing.</b> <b>In</b> {{spite of the}} designers' efforts to {{conserve}} weight, the new weapon made the vehicle nose-heavy {{to such an extent}} that the forward suspension springs were under constant compression. This resulted in the tank tending to sway even when no steering was being applied, an effect compounded by the introduction of the Ausführung H in March 1943.|$|E
5|$|To wear tefillin without {{reciting the}} blessings: This is the opinion of, among others, Jacob ben Asher, Moses of Coucy and David HaLevi Segal. The {{advantage}} of this compromise is that one avoids the transgressions of either not donning tefillin or making a <b>blessing</b> <b>in</b> vain.|$|E

5|$|Arjuna, {{one of the}} Pandavas, recollects a curse {{which could}} help him stay incognito for one year. In the past, Arjuna was felicitated by Indra, the king of deities for gaining the divine weapon, Pashupatastra, from Lord Shiva through {{dedicated}} devotion. The celestial dancer Urvashi {{falls in love with}} Arjuna but he rejects her advances as he considered her a motherly figure. Feeling insulted, Urvashi cursed him to lose his masculinity and turn into an eunuch. Indra arrived and asked Arjuna to treat this curse as a <b>blessing</b> <b>in</b> disguise as the 13th year is arriving. Taking this into account, Arjuna turns into a transgender dance teacher Brihannala.|$|E
5|$|Peggy {{makes her}} first {{appearance}} in Albert Square, when Sam's desire to escape from her family causes her to elope with Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), {{at the age of}} sixteen. Peggy tries to persuade Sam that getting married at the age of sixteen will ruin her life, but she is unsuccessful. Peggy later accepts Sam and Ricky's relationship and leaves, after giving the couple her <b>blessing.</b> <b>In</b> 1992, it is revealed that Peggy is in a relationship with Kevin, whom she had an affair with during her marriage to Eric.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 21 January 1971, a force of 100 PAVN/Viet Cong commandos {{attacked}} Pochentong airfield, the main base of the Khmer Air Force. In this one action, the raiders destroyed almost the entire inventory of government aircraft, including all of its fighter planes. This {{may have been a}} <b>blessing</b> <b>in</b> disguise, however, since the air force was largely composed of old (even obsolete) Soviet aircraft. The Americans soon replaced the airplanes with more advanced models. The attack did, however, stall a proposed FANK offensive. Two weeks later, Lon Nol suffered a stroke and was evacuated to Hawaii for treatment. It had been a mild stroke, however, and the general recovered quickly, returning to Cambodia after only two months.|$|E

5|$|On November 22, 2014, UCLA {{announced}} that it would officially retire the number 42 across all university sports, effective immediately. While Robinson wore several different numbers during his UCLA career, the school chose 42 because it had become indelibly identified with him. The only sport this did not affect was men's basketball, which had previously retired the number for Walt Hazzard (although Kevin Love was actually the last player in that sport to wear 42, with Hazzard's <b>blessing).</b> <b>In</b> a move paralleling that of MLB when it retired the number, UCLA allowed three athletes (in women's soccer, softball, and football) who were already wearing 42 to continue to do so for the remainder of their UCLA careers. The school also announced it would prominently display the number at all of its athletic venues.|$|E
5|$|The grandsons are {{depicted}} {{in very different}} styles: Alessandro acts in a formal manner and wears clothes of similar colour and tones to Paul. Ottavio, by contrast, wears the browns of the upper right-hand passage, {{an area of the}} painting that cuts him physically from the pope. His pose is awkward and difficult to interpret, but he is rendered in a more naturalistic manner than his brother. Alessandro has a distracted, brooding expression. He holds the knob of Paul's backrest, in an echo of Raphael's portrait where Clement VII holds the chair of Leo X as an indicator of his ambitions of succession. Thus Alessandro seems better placed politically, standing to Paul's right in a pose that recalls traditional depictions of Paul the Apostle, and his hand is raised as if in <b>blessing.</b> <b>In</b> the end, Paul was unable to influence his succession after Charles V weakened the Medici hold on the office.|$|E
5|$|The {{sentences}} provoked international {{criticism and}} {{protests against the}} Spanish government. Large demonstrations took place in Italy, Stockholm and Oslo, with the Swedish Prime Minister, Olof Palme, heading the Swedish demonstration. The Dutch foreign minister made a formal protest to the Spanish Ambassador. The Spanish Embassy in Lisbon was attacked and set on fire. The Spanish embassy in Switzerland was occupied for 2 hours by protesters. President of Mexico, Luis Echeverría, called for Spanish membership of the United Nations Security Council to be suspended, but this was vetoed by the US, who considered it an internal Spanish matter. Pope Paul VI asked the Spanish government to grant clemency to the condemned at his Sunday <b>blessing</b> <b>in</b> St. Peter's Square, though he also condemned the crimes that the condemned were convicted of. Franco's brother, Nicolás Franco, joined calls for clemency, appealing to Franco's Christianity.|$|E

5|$|Choosing {{to support}} a Reason {{will result in a}} {{different}} ending depending on who is chosen, but in each the world is reborn {{in the image of the}} chosen Reason after the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi to prove his resolve. Chiaki and Isamu die before the Demi-fiend begins and give him their <b>blessing</b> <b>in</b> spirit form, while Hikawa accompanies the Demi-fiend into their new world. If Takao's wishes are followed, the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi and the world is returned to its pre-Conception state, resurrecting and restoring all the main characters. If the Demi-fiend rejects Takao's wishes, Kagutsuchi curses him for allowing the world to die and departs, leaving the Demi-fiend as the only survivor in a barren world of demons, trapped as it is until another Conception can happen. If the Demi-fiend fulfills Lucifer's request of collecting the Candelabra from the Fiends, Kagutsuchi attacks him and is destroyed, breaking the Great Will's control over the worlds. After this, Lucifer fights the Demi-fiend to test his strength, then declares him to be the ultimate weapon in the upcoming war against the Great Will.|$|E
5|$|The 2002–03 {{season began}} with the same {{optimism}} that the Raptors exhibited in three consecutive playoff seasons, although it faded early. Carter, while voted as a starter in the 2003 All-Star Game, suffered a knee injury, while Davis expressed disinterest in Toronto, and Wilkens' laissez-faire attitude created a team that lacked the motivation and spirit of the previous years' teams. The team was ravaged with injuries, losing an NBA record number of player games due to injury. Furthermore, the Raptors recorded the dubious honour of being the only team in NBA history not to dress 12 players for a single game in a season. Wilkens was criticized heavily by the Toronto media for his inability {{to clamp down on}} his players when necessary, especially given this was the year that Wilkens overtook Bill Fitch for the most losses by an NBA coach, with his loss total getting dangerously close to his win total. The Raptors ended the season with a 24–58 record and Wilkens was fired. This {{turned out to be a}} <b>blessing</b> <b>in</b> disguise, when the Raptors were given the 4th overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft and brought another star to Toronto in Chris Bosh.|$|E
5|$|Vorenus and Pullo set off {{in search}} of the eagle, encountering and rescuing Octavian from his captors. Octavian thanks them and {{promises}} that they will be rewarded. Vorenus and Pullo discover Pompey's slave with the eagle hiding in the bandit cart and kill him, realizing the bandits were hired by Pompey. A politically astute Octavian explains that their mission is only a gesture, since the theft of the eagle is actually a <b>blessing</b> <b>in</b> disguise to Caesar. Civil war between Caesar and Pompey is inevitable, but Caesar needs Pompey to make the first move so as not to appear the aggressor; Pompey is likely to do that if he believes Caesar's soldiers {{are on the verge of}} desertion. The trio returns in triumph to camp, where a surprised yet grateful Caesar takes the eagle back and more than adequate proof of Pompey's hostility. He sends Pompey the head of his slave and informs him of his next move, to winter the 13th Legion at Ravenna on the Italian border, in preparation for pressing his rights to the Consulship. Pompey breaks all ties with Caesar and takes Cornelia as his wife. Octavia, humiliated at being used by Pompey and heartbroken over her pointless divorce, says she wants him dead.|$|E

25|$|During the 1990s, a {{discussion}} {{began in the}} Roman Catholic Church about blessings for same-sex unions. Central teaching remains clear that such unions can in no ways be sanctioned by the Catholic Church. However, there are exceptions when individual priests carry out informal blessings. They risk being disciplined if the blessing is discovered. In the Roman Catholic Diocese of Aachen in Germany, five same-sex unions received a <b>blessing</b> <b>in</b> German town of Mönchengladbach. In 2007, one same-sex union received a <b>blessing</b> <b>in</b> German town of Wetzlar in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg. In October 2014 a blessing of a same-sex union took place in Bürglen, Uri, Switzerland. The priest subsequently made a public apology. A blessing of a same-sex union, equivalent to marriage except name, took place by a Catholic Dominican priest in Malta in 2015. In May 2015 the Central Committee of German Catholics voted in favour of blessing of same-sex unions.|$|E
