It is a rare, less intense form of the disease with wheals (swollen areas of the skin) that affect certain, fixed areas of the body.

5|$|Joseph Johnson (15 November 1738 – 20 December 1809) was an {{influential}} 18th-century London bookseller and publisher.

Johnson is best known for publishing the works of radical thinkers such as Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, Thomas Malthus, and Joel Barlow, feminist economist Priscilla Wakefield, as well as religious dissenters such as Joseph Priestley, Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Gilbert Wakefield, and George Walker.|$|E

5|$|Sharks {{generally}} are opportunistic feeders, but scientists propose that megalodon was largely predatory. Its great size, high-speed swimming capability, and powerful jaws, {{coupled with a}} formidable feeding apparatus, made it an apex predator capable of consuming a <b>broad</b> <b>spectrum</b> of animals. A study focusing on calcium isotopes of extinct and extant elasmobranch sharks and rays revealed that megalodon fed at a higher trophic level than the contemporaneous great white shark, {{that is to say}} it was higher up in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|The Laue back {{reflection}} mode records X-rays scattered backwards from a <b>broad</b> <b>spectrum</b> source. This is useful if {{the sample is}} too thick for X-rays to transmit through it. The diffracting planes in the crystal are determined by knowing that the normal to the diffracting plane bisects the angle between the incident beam and the diffracted beam. A Greninger chart {{can be used to}} interpret the {{back reflection}} Laue photograph.|$|E

5|$|The {{frequency}} of a photon {{is proportional to}} its energy. As a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom, it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies. For instance, when atoms are irradiated by a source with a <b>broad</b> <b>spectrum,</b> distinct absorption lines appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation. Each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the hydrogen spectral series. Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the popular jazz and swing music listened to by mainstream America, {{there were a number}} of other genres that were popular among certain groups of people—e.g., minorities or rural audiences. Beginning in the 1920s and accelerating greatly in the 1940s, the blues began rapidly diversifying into a <b>broad</b> <b>spectrum</b> of new styles. These included an uptempo, energetic style called rhythm and blues (R), a merger of blues and Anglo-Celtic song called country music and the fusion of hymns and spirituals with blues structures called gospel music. Later than these other styles, in the 1940s, a blues, R and country fusion eventually called rock and roll developed, eventually coming to dominate American popular by the beginning of the 1960s.|$|E

In particular, the film sparked a verbal war between Jalen Rose and Duke University's Grant Hill {{through the media}} regarding issues of race in sports and education that fueled the Duke–Michigan basketball rivalry. Coincidentally, the following week, the 2011 editions of Michigan and Duke met {{in the third round}} of the 2011 NCAA Men's DivisionI Basketball Tournament; Duke won, 73-71.|$|E

5|$|These {{scattering}} methods generally use monochromatic X-rays, {{which are}} restricted to a single wavelength with minor deviations. A <b>broad</b> <b>spectrum</b> of X-rays (that is, a blend of X-rays with different wavelengths) {{can also be used}} to carry out X-ray diffraction, a technique known as the Laue method. This is the method used in the original discovery of X-ray diffraction. Laue scattering provides much structural information with only a short exposure to the X-ray beam, and is therefore used in structural studies of very rapid events (Time resolved crystallography). However, it is not as well-suited as monochromatic scattering for determining the full atomic structure of a crystal and therefore works better with crystals with relatively simple atomic arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{classical}} music grew gradually more experimental and progressive into the mid-20th century, while popular tastes {{have tended to}} stick with well established composers and compositions of the past. The 2004-2005 program at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples is typical of modern Italy: of the eight operas represented, the most recent was Puccini. In symphonic music, of the 26 composers whose music was played, 21 of them were from the 19th century or earlier, composers who use the melodies and harmonies typical of the Romantic era. This focus is common to other European traditions, and is known as postmodernism, a school of thought that draws on earlier harmonic and melodic concepts that pre-date the conceptions of atonality and dissonance. This focus on popular historical composers has helped to maintain a continued presence of {{classical music}} across a <b>broad</b> <b>spectrum</b> of Italian society. When music {{is part of a}} public display or gathering, it is often chosen from a very eclectic repertoire that is as likely to include well-known classical music as popular music.|$|E

25|$|The {{basis for}} this <b>broader</b> <b>spectrum</b> of {{activity}} of lamotrigine is unknown, but could relate to actions of the drug on voltage-activated calcium channels. Lamotrigine blocks T-type calcium channels weakly, if at all. However, it does inhibit native and recombinant high-voltage–activated calcium channels (N- and P/Q/R-types) at therapeutic concentrations. Whether this activity on calcium channels accounts for lamotrigine's <b>broader</b> clinical <b>spectrum</b> of activity in comparison with phenytoin and carbamazepine remains to be determined.|$|R
