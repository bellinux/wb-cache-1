5|$|Shaw {{was knocked}} {{unconscious}} and swept downstream. A third {{member of the}} group raised the alarm by mobile telephone by 14:05 (GMT), less than five minutes after Shaw had <b>been</b> <b>swept</b> away, and Devon and Cornwall Police, a Royal Navy helicopter and the Dartmoor Rescue Group were mobilised to search for Shaw. Believing that the weather conditions may be too bad for the helicopter to fly, members of the Dartmoor Rescue Group—a volunteer organisation which co-ordinates the four separate charities who undertake search and rescue operations on Dartmoor—set out on foot in an attempt to reach the scene of the accident.|$|E
5|$|The maindeck of Chesapeake {{was almost}} deserted, having <b>been</b> <b>swept</b> by Shannons gunfire; the {{surviving}} gun crews had either {{responded to the}} call for boarders or had taken refuge below. Two American officers, Lieutenant Cox (who had returned from carrying Captain Lawrence down to the surgeon) and Midshipman Russell saw that the aftmost 18-pounders on the port side, still bore on Shannon and working between them managed to fire both.|$|E
5|$|This {{first became}} {{evident in the}} great {{campaign}} to re-elect Gladstone. Known today as the Midlothian campaign, it was masterminded by the Roseberys. Rosebery used his influence to have Gladstone invited to stand as parliamentary candidate for Midlothian, near to Rosebery's Dalmeny estate. Gladstone had nominally retired from politics after losing his Greenwich seat in 1874, when Disraeli had <b>been</b> <b>swept</b> to power. The campaign was based at Dalmeny where Lady Rosebery hosted a series of large political house parties throughout the long campaign. The Tories were later to claim that Rosebery had paid for Gladstone's campaign. Rosebery later admitted to spending £50,000.|$|E

5|$|On December29, Alibera began {{a steady}} track to the {{southwest}} after the ridge weakened, and briefly deteriorated to minimal tropical storm status. However, it re-intensified to just shy of tropical cyclone status on January1. Shortly thereafter, Alibera made landfall north of Mananjary in southeastern Madagascar, at 3 a.m. local time on New Year's Day, with 10‑minute winds of 115km/h (70mph). The storm quickly weakened over land, but again restrengthened upon reaching the Mozambique Channel on January3. This was short-lived, as Alibera weakened back to tropical depression status by January5. The storm moved to the southeast, turned {{to the southwest}}, and finally back to the southeast before dissipating on January7, having <b>been</b> <b>swept</b> into the westerlies.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of undigested {{food in the}} stomach and seed pods still {{in the mouth of}} many of the specimens suggests neither starvation nor exposure are likely. The maturity of this ingested vegetation places the time of death in autumn rather than in spring, when flowers would be expected. The animals may have fallen through ice into small ponds or potholes, entombing them. Many are certainly known to have been killed in rivers, perhaps through being swept away by floods. In one location, by the Berelekh River in Yakutia in Siberia, more than 8,000 bones from at least 140 mammoths have been found in a single spot, apparently having <b>been</b> <b>swept</b> there by the current.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Pearl Ridge (30–31 December 1944) was an {{engagement}} of the Second World War fought between Australian and Japanese forces on Bougainville Island. Part {{of the wider}} Bougainville Campaign, the battle {{took place in the}} central sector of the island, shortly after the Australians had taken over responsibility from the Americans. Believing that the ridge was held by less than a company of Japanese, on 30 December the Australian 25th Infantry Battalion launched a four-pronged attacked the ridge. The defending force, however, had been greatly reinforced by elements of the 38th Independent Mixed Brigade and was closer to a battalion in strength. After being held up on the right of their advance, the Australians dug-in overnight and repulsed a strong Japanese counterattack before resuming the attack on 31 December. By late in the afternoon, the Japanese had <b>been</b> <b>swept</b> off the ridge. The Australians later established an observation post on the ridge, which had commanding views of the whole island, and throughout the remainder of the campaign used it to control artillery fire as they advanced towards Japanese enclaves in the north and south of the island.|$|E

5|$|At the marabout's zawiya, Eberhardt was {{weakened}} by fever. She returned to Aïn Sefra, and was treated {{at the military}} hospital. She left the hospital against medical advice and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been separated for several months, to join her. Reunited on 20October 1904, they rented a small mud house. The following day, a flash flood struck the area. As soon as the waters subsided, Lyautey launched a search for her. Ehnni was discovered almost immediately, saying that Eberhardt had <b>been</b> <b>swept</b> away by the water. Based on this information, Lyautey and his men searched the surrounding area for several days before deciding to explore {{the ruins of the}} house the couple had stayed in. Her body was crushed under one of the house's supporting beams. The exact circumstances of her death were never discovered. While some biographers have raised suspicions regarding Ehnni, most believe it more likely that Eberhardt, who had always believed she would die young, instead accepted her fate. Mackworth speculated that after initially trying to run from the floodwaters, Eberhardt instead turned back to face them. Blanch argued that due to Eberhardt's history of suicidal tendencies, she probably would have still chosen to stay in the area even if she had known the flood was coming. Lyautey buried Eberhardt in Aïn Sefra and had a marble tombstone, engraved with her adopted name in Arabic and her birth name in French, placed on her grave.|$|E

25|$|Some of the forts are now {{in varying}} stages of dereliction, the most ruined being Les Hommeaux Florains, perched on {{outlying}} rocks, its access causeway and bridge having <b>been</b> <b>swept</b> away long ago. Houmet Herbé resembles a Crusader castle with its squat round towers. Like many of the forts, it included such apparently anachronistic features as a drawbridge and machicolation, which were still common in military architecture of the period.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{spokesperson}} for the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG), the quake was felt in several mainland towns, but no damage or deaths were reported. The Mentawai Islands may have acted as a barrier, shielding the Sumatran coast by absorbing the brunt of the tsunami. As of October 30, 2010, the confirmed death toll stands at 435, with 110 more unaccounted for. Many of the missing are believed to have <b>been</b> <b>swept</b> out to sea.|$|E

25|$|There {{are quite}} regular records of live and {{stranded}} leatherback turtle {{in and around}} the Irish Sea. This species travels north to the waters off the British Isles every year following the swarms of jellyfish that form its prey.

They have strayed or <b>been</b> <b>swept</b> out of their natural range further south into colder waters.|$|E

The May 16 loss at Baylor marked the first time that Nebraska had <b>been</b> <b>swept</b> in league play since the 2000 season.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the trailers being swept away by the torrent, many houses, with people still in or on top of them, were swept into Lake Ontario.
