[...] "Then came the day when I was told I must go to bed in the afternoon because I was going to be allowed to sing with Mummy and Pop in the evening," [...] Andrews explained. She would stand on a <b>beer</b> <b>crate</b> to sing into the microphone, sometimes a solo or as a duet with her stepfather, while her mother played piano.

50|$|The team’s swansong was as dancing shepherds in the British {{premiere of}} the medieval French fable Aucassin and Nicolette, {{translated}} by Alex Kerr and produced by Pennock in the college grounds on 27 June 1971. The use of a full <b>beer</b> <b>crate</b> as a prop did {{not interfere with the}} narrative.|$|E
50|$|The CD {{included}} {{the video of}} the single, featuring John walking around Manchester landmarks (most with some reference to the band's background - Big Hands bar, Night & Day Café etc.), with a <b>beer</b> <b>crate</b> attached to his foot. As he often uses a crate {{in lieu of a}} guitar strap, could be interpreted as a knowing nod to their fans.|$|E

50|$|Athletic races {{involving}} alcohol {{including the}} beer mile, {{which consists of}} a mile run with a can of beer consumed before {{each of the four}} laps. A variant is known in German speaking countries as Bierkastenlauf (<b>beer</b> <b>crate</b> running) where a team of two carries a crate of beer along a route of several kilometers and must consume all of the bottles prior to crossing the finish line.|$|E
50|$|The area is {{also used}} for sports, with runners and {{mountain}} bikers dominating in the summer, and cross-country skiing in the winter. Sledding is popular on the descent towards Ilmenau, the run with an altitude difference of more than 350 m takes about 15 minutes. Regular competitions are the Kickelhahn mountain race for runners, a mountain time trial for cyclists, and the <b>beer</b> <b>crate</b> race (Bierathlon) of TU Ilmenau.|$|E
50|$|The Gyro UP was {{introduced}} in October 1985. It differs from the Gyro X by replacing {{the front and rear}} tie-down racks with a single heavy-duty baggage platform fixed directly to the rear engine pod, giving the appearance of a scooter pick-up truck. This platform has a rubber-mat loading area of 450 mm × 570mm that is rated for 30 kg. Honda claims it is sized for a 20 bottle <b>beer</b> <b>crate,</b> a container that is roughly similar to the plastic milk crate common in other countries.|$|E
50|$|In the Czech Republic most beer {{is sold in}} {{returnable}} glass bottles that carry a CZK 3 deposit. These bottles are collected by shops and supermarkets. Reverse vending machines have mostly replaced human staff. There is also a CZK 100 deposit on plastic <b>beer</b> <b>crates</b> with a 20 bottle capacity. Most reverse vending machines accept an entire crate full of empty bottles, returning CZK 160. There is no deposit on other containers.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a popular}} (but false) theory {{that there was a}} brewery called [...] "S. Hockey and Sons" [...] in the West Country of England whose <b>beer</b> <b>crates</b> were used to measure out the 9 feet from the dartboard. This tale is also {{sometimes}} associated with the phrase [...] "toeing the hockey". However, according to a statement made by the Brewery History Society in the 1990s, no records of such a brewery can be found.|$|R
50|$|This leg's Detour was {{a choice}} between Stein or Stack. In Stein, teams headed to the Wolfsee Halle {{restaurant}} and carried twenty-two full steins of beer and carefully delivered them all at once through the crowd. If they could deliver the mugs without dropping or spilling them, they would receive their next clue. In Stack, teams traveled to the grounds of Hasenöhrl-Hof and had to vertically stack fifteen empty <b>beer</b> <b>crates</b> with one team member standing on top of them. The team that could complete the stack without falling off, would get their next clue.|$|R
5000|$|Lapinlahden Linnut (founded in {{the spring}} of 1983) is a Finnish band which plays humorous rock/pop music. The band started as {{roadside}} musicians. In the beginning, the band used some original instruments such as a ring binder, and they still use an empty <b>beer</b> <b>crate</b> nowadays in their music. Lapinlahden Linnut have made 7 TV-series, and when third of them, Maailman kahdeksan ihmettä, was in Montreaux, it had name: [...] "Rampton Birds -show: Eight wonders of the World".

5|$|The {{stage of}} the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood {{balanced}} {{on the top of}} <b>beer</b> <b>crates,</b> so the two groups made a bet to see to who {{would be the first to}} break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it finally broke. Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|R
50|$|Pivotal in {{the rise}} of snooker as one of Britain's most popular sports was the 1972 World Championship final. As {{defending}} champion in the 1972 event, Spencer beat Fred Davis 31-21 and Eddie Charlton 37-32, before facing championship debutant Alex Higgins in the final. The week-long final was fairly balanced until the Thursday evening session which Higgins won 6-0, creating a gap Spencer never looked like closing. Higgins duly went on to take the match 37-32. The match, played at the British Legion Club in Selly Oak Birmingham, often with emergency generators providing the lighting and with hundreds of spectators crammed in, many sat on <b>beer</b> <b>crates,</b> provided the crucial spark of interest in the modern era. Higgins was already generating much interest in the game and had been the subject of documentary by Thames TV ahead of the final.|$|R
5000|$|Diesel railbus {{services}} were introduced by British Railways Western Region on the Tetbury branch line on 2 February 1959, {{and on the}} same day two halts were opened on that line, at Church's Hill and at Trouble House. It was built to serve the Trouble House public house (named for the difficulties which beset a series of innkeepers in the 18th and 19th centuries), and was the only station in England built specifically to serve a pub, although Berney Arms station in Norfolk has much the same function. The landlord of the Trouble House Inn used to supply a <b>beer</b> <b>crate</b> to enable passengers to step up into the coaches.|$|E
5000|$|Born in Copenhagen, Fischer {{studied at}} Eks-skolen where he learnt welding under Poul Gernes. The school's {{experimental}} approach provided significant impetus to his development. He began exhibiting in 1963, presenting his first welded pieces {{the following year}} with humorous titles such as [...] "Besværlig tanke på sokkel" [...] (Difficult Thoughts on a Plinth) or [...] "Svævende port med hank og søjler" [...] (Floating Gate with Handles and Columns). In 1967, he contributed Ølkasseskulptur (<b>Beer</b> <b>Crate</b> Sculpture) to an outdoor exhibition. Further experimentation in the 1970s resulted {{in a series of}} monumental works including his Skuptur-broen connecting Birkerød's town hall with its library. The huge work combined art and function, combining carved structural elements and coloured flowers.|$|E
5000|$|Regional beer brewer Karlsberg {{has taken}} {{advantage}} of the Saarlandish dialect to create clever advertising for its staple product, UrPils. Examples include a trio of men enjoying a beer, flanked by baby carriages, the slogan reading [...] "Mutter schafft" [...] (meaning [...] "Moms at work" [...] in Saarlandish, but plays on the High German word [...] "Mutterschaft", or [...] "motherhood"); another depicts a trio of men at a bar, with one realizing his beer has been drunk by one of the others, the slogan reading [...] "Kenner wars" [...] (meaning [...] "It was no one" [...] war es in Saarlandish, but playing on the High German word [...] "Kenner", or [...] "connoisseur", translating to [...] "It was a connoisseur"); a third shows an empty <b>beer</b> <b>crate</b> in the middle of outer space, the text reading [...] "All" [...] (meaning [...] "empty" [...] in Saarlandish, but playing on the same High German word meaning [...] "outer space").|$|E

5000|$|The party ran an election-show {{which was}} totally {{unconventional}} in Swedish politics. Wachtmeister and Karlsson for instance became known for illustrating their economic arguments by piling up empty <b>beer</b> <b>crates.</b> They popularly {{became known as}} [...] "The Count and the Valet", noting their contrasting backgrounds. In the summer of 1991, some opinion polls showed more than 10% support for the party. During an election-night television program, Bengt Westerberg, leader of the Liberal People's Party, left the studio in protest against New Democracy's immigration policy. Alf Svensson of the Christian Democrats and Olof Johansson of the Centre Party followed shortly after. In the 1991 general election, the party won 6.7% of the vote and 25 seats. In the Riksdag, New Democracy abstained from voting on the office of Prime Minister, and thus gave the four-party liberal-conservative government led by Carl Bildt its indirect support.|$|R

5000|$|The festival {{first took}} place in Mahanayim in 1978, {{as part of a}} monthly folk club in an old stone {{building}} in the kibbutz. The club was founded by three kibbutz members and immigrants from England - Menachem Vinegrad, Morris Cohen and Yigal Sela - and featured solely acoustic performances from young artists from the Galilee region and guests from abroad. As described on their website, [...] "The club, {{the first of its kind}} north of Tel Aviv, attracted young people and wandering folk singers from all over the Galilee. The long-haired, would-be flower children sat cheerfully squashed together on wooden benches and <b>beer</b> <b>crates.</b> The lack of electricity posed no problem as kerosene lanterns illuminated the stone hall and amplification was frowned upon by the hard core folkies. Menachem and Morris would travel south to search for new musicians in pubs and clubs.
