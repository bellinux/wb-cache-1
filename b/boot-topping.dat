60|$|While we looked, {{the waters}} {{increased}} so fast {{in this place}} {{that in a few}} minutes a torrent was roaring by the little stable and its margin encroaching steadily on the logs. We suddenly realized that this flood was not a mere holiday spectacle, but meant damage--and not only to the small log stable but to the Overland buildings close to the main river, for the waves had now come ashore and were creeping about the foundations and invading the great hay-corral adjoining. We ran down and joined the crowd of excited men and frightened animals. We waded knee-deep into the log stable, unfastened the horses and waded out almost waist-deep, so fast the waters increased. Then the crowd rushed in a body to the hay-corral and began to tumble down the huge stacks of baled hay and roll the bales up on the high ground by the house. Meantime it was discovered that Owens, an overland driver, was missing, and a man ran to the large stable, and wading in, <b>boot-top</b> deep, discovered him asleep in his bed, awoke him, and waded out again. But Owens was drowsy and resumed his nap; but only for a minute or two, for presently he turned in his bed, his hand dropped over the side and came in contact with the cold water! It was up level with the mattress! He waded out, breast-deep, almost, and the next moment the sun-burned bricks melted down like sugar and the big building crumbled to a ruin and was washed away in a twinkling.|$|R
60|$|This answer mystified the vice-governatore, and {{completely}} puzzled Vito Viti. The grave mariners {{at the other}} table, too, thought it odd, for in no other tongue {{is the language of}} the sea as poetical, or figurative, as in the English; and the term of <b>boot-top,</b> as applied to a vessel, was Greek to them, {{as well as to the}} other listeners. They conversed among themselves on the subject, while their two superiors were holding a secret conference on the other side of the room, giving the American time to rally his recollection, and remember the precise circumstances in which not only he himself, but all his shipmates, were placed. No one could be more wily and ingenious than this man, when on his guard, though the inextinguishable hatred with which he regarded England and Englishmen had come so near causing him to betray a secret which it was extremely important, at that moment, to conceal. At length a general silence prevailed, the different groups of speakers ceasing to converse, and all looking towards the vice-governatore, as if in expectation that he was about to suggest something that might give a turn to the discourse. Nor was this a mistake, for, after inquiring of Benedetta if she had a private room, he invited Ithuel and the interpreter to follow him into it, leading the way, attended by the podestà. As soon as these four were thus separated from the others, the door was closed, and the two Tuscans came at once to the point.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyse {{the types}} and causes of {{injuries}} associated with recreational snowboarding and to compare these with the injuries seen in alpine skiing. DESIGN: Prospective case series. SETTING: Rural hospital near three large ski resorts. PATIENTS: All people presenting to the Emergency Department with an injury caused by snowboarding during two ski seasons (1988 - 90). Of the 115 injured snowboarders identified, 73 (63 %) completed the questionnaire. Information {{on the other}} patients {{was obtained from the}} hospital emergency records. Information was also obtained on seven alpine skiers who collided with snowboarders. RESULTS: Of the snowboarders 87 (76 %) were male, and the mean age was 20. 3 years. A total of 132 injuries were documented. Of the respondents to the questionnaire 83 % reported that their fitness level was excellent or above average, 36 % had never been on a snowboard previously, 25 % were in their first year of snowboarding, 39 % reported excellent snow conditions, 59 % reported light traffic on the hill, and 7 % had consumed alcohol before their accident. Injuries were equally divided between the upper body and the legs, 75 % of the lower-limb injuries involving the left (lead) leg. Significant differences were noted between the patterns of injuries in snowboarding and alpine skiing: snowboarders were less likely to have lacerations (0 % v. 8 % respectively), <b>boot-top</b> contusions (0 % v. 4 %), thumb injuries (1 % v. 10 %) and knee sprains (14 % v. 27 %) and more likely to have spinal injuries (12 % v. 4 %), foot or ankle injuries (28 % v. 5 %) and distal radius fractures (10 % v. 1 %). CONCLUSIONS: Snowboarding is associated with a unique pattern of injuries, the knowledge of which could influence snowboarder education, accident prevention and equipment design. Additional research is needed to understand better the types, causes and rates of injury associated with snowboarding...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 Releasable {{alpine ski}} {{bindings}} were developed and standardized in the 1970 s {{to mitigate the}} risk of twisting and binding fractures of the tibia-fibula, {{but they have not}} been effective at mitigating knee injuries. They have two primary functions: 1) Retention – keep the ski attached to the skiers boot if the loads on the tibia are not dangerous and 2) Release – release the ski from the skiers boot before the loads on the tibia become injurious. Alpine touring is a subset of alpine skiing in which skiers use specialized alpine touring (AT) bindings to ascend non-maintained trails and ski down them. The proliferation of AT bindings has exploded in the last 10 years and the changes and innovations to this sector of the binding market have far outpaced the international standards organization ability to define standardized boot-binding interface geometry or AT boot-binding performance. The relative risk of injury when using AT equipment has not been explored. To address these issues, the objective of this research is quantify the performance of alpine and AT boot-binding systems using standardized laboratory test methods and field measurements to evaluate the risk skiers of lower leg and ACL injuries. Laboratory measurements were performed to compare the retention and release characteristics of alpine boot-binding systems to AT boot-binding systems. When AT boots were mixed with alpine bindings, the release characteristics were altered to the degree that using such a combination would increase the risk of a lower leg injury to skiers. When testing AT bindings with AT boots from different ski boot manufacturers, significant variation in the release characteristics was measured. Anecdotally, many skiers dis-trust the retention function of AT bindings because of this variability in performance, and some manually lock out the release mechanism of the binding, exposing themselves to a high risk of a lower leg injury. In order to improve the performance of AT boot-binding systems, it is necessary to quantify the performance requirements of these systems, defined as the loads they must transmit from the ski to the skier. To this end, field measurements of the loads transmitted through the binding to the skier were performed. The loads at the <b>boot-top</b> and the knee were estimated for male and female skiers using alpine and AT bindings. As a whole, AT and Alpine bindings transfer the same net loads to skiers. However, The toe piece of AT bindings transfers most of the load to the skiers but has a very limited ability to absorb energy, exposing a potential weakness for retention performance. Male and female skiers generate loads that reach the release envelope of the binding. However, females generate significantly greater adduction loads at the knee, a known risk factor for ACL injuries. The lateral force at the binding toe piece was well correlated with knee loads in females but not males, indicating that a binding design could incorporate more sophisticated mechanisms at the toe to reduce peak knee loads in females. Interventions designed for female skiers may not prove beneficial for male skiers...|$|R
5000|$|She {{differed}} from other Sealink ships in carrying a gold-coloured sculpted [...] "three legs of man" [...] on her funnels {{rather than the}} standard BR double chevron. Later, publicity images were released of her painted in the Sea Containers era Sealink livery of white hull with blue trim, but these were mockups and the colours never applied. Due to problems with ship availability she was recalled hurriedly from dry dock before the paint job was completed, with just the new blue <b>boot-topping</b> applied. After the Steam Packet takeover her unwashed blue hull was given a rough overpaint of black, retaining the BR red funnels (rather than the differently-hued Steam Packet red). Following the takeover, the crew persisted in flying the Manx Line house pennant, rather than the management-mandated Steam Packet one. Later as a continued sign of protest against the takeover the crew changed this to half of a Manx Line pennant.|$|E
50|$|Blue Star Line {{was formed}} as an {{initiative}} by the Vestey Brothers, a Liverpool-based butchers company, who had founded the Union Cold Storage Company {{to take advantage}} of refrigeration practices. They developed a large importation business, shipping frozen meat from South America to Britain, initially from Argentina on ships of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, and other shipping lines that called at South American ports. The high prices charged for transport by these companies led the Vestey brothers to start to operate their own ships. They chartered their first ships from 1904, and began to buy their own ships from 1909 onwards. The Blue Star Line was officially inaugurated on 28 July 1911, initially using second-hand ships. They ordered their first new ship in 1914, and by the outbreak of the First World War were operating twelve refrigerated cargo ships. These were initially prefixed 'Brod', e.g. Brodfield, Brodholme and Brodland. Ships of the company were identifiable by their red funnels with black tops and narrow white and black bands, with a white circle with blue five-pointed star on the red background. Their hull colours were either black or black with a white band, and red <b>boot-topping.</b>|$|E

Her hull was painted white with a green <b>boot-topping</b> for the cruising duties. On September 20, 1938, the Carinthia was on a cruise from New York to the Caribbean, 150 miles north of Florida when she was warned of bad weather ahead, the infamous 1938 hurricane. She turned to avoid the storm, but the storm also turned and she sailed right into it. Despite category 5 winds and huge seas, she survived the storm with only cosmetic damage and sick passengers. In August 1939 she was converted into an armed merchant cruiser, retaining the name Carinthia. She was accepted into service on 30 December 1939. At 13.13 hours on 6 June 1940 the Carinthia, on a northern patrol, was torpedoed off the coast of Ireland west of Galway Bay, in coordinates [...] by the [...] The badly damaged ship remained afloat for 36 hours before she sank during the evening of 7 June.
