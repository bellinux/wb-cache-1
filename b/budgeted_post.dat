Only the Conservative Party and the Liberal Left Party voted against municipalization. These parties subsequently attempted to privatize cinemas in the years after 1926, but failed.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} budget feasible mechanism design proposed by Singer (2010), but in a Bayesian setting. A principal has a public value for hiring {{a subset of the}} agents and a budget, while the agents have private costs for being hired.

We show that there are simple, practical, ex <b>post</b> <b>budget</b> balanced <b>posted</b> pricing mechanisms that approximate the value obtained by the Bayesian optimal mechanism that is budget balanced only in expectation. A main motivating application for this work is the crowdsourcing large projects, e. g., on Mechanical Turk, where workers are drawn from a large population and posted pricing is standard.

PT Frisian Flag Indonesia (FFI) is one of Milk Processing Industries in Indonesia. FFI has 18 fresh milk suppliers which locate in DKI Jakarta, West Java, Central Java and East Java. This scarcity of fresh milk will affect the continuity of production in FFI.

The aim {{of the study is}} to develop a new theoretical strategic framework to support Facilities maintenance management of Higher Education Institutions facilities in Nigeria. The key objectives of the study include: investigating the current theoretical approaches to facilities maintenance management, evaluating works and services departments’ constraints in relation to procurement strategies, maintenance methods, maintenance <b>budgets,</b> <b>post</b> occupancy evaluations, project quality control, sustainable programme, and the influence of culture on project execution. Others objectives include: developing a strategic framework to support facilities maintenance management, and validating its effectiveness and the efficiency. The scope of the study is focussed on the general maintenance of all building elements; services provided in the selected twelve HEIs in south west of Nigeria. The study adopted a mixed method research strategy by conducting series of semi-structured interviews with the directors of works and services of the selected HEIs, and a questionnaire survey of the 36 Technical Officers from the selected HEIs in Nigeria. The qualitative and quantitative data collected were analysed by using thematic analyses and multiple regressions respectively. The findings of the thematic analyses of the interviews reveal that, there was a general shortage of financial resources that allow keeping of backlogs of maintenance and repairs of HEIs buildings across both the federal and state HEIs. The work identified that, the following factors have caused majority of the backlogs of maintenance: low level of overall maintenance budget, delays in releasing cash (maintenance funds), lack of the adoption and use of planned prevent maintenance method, a shortage of in-house technical staff, and the absence of maintenance programmes and maintenance schedules.
