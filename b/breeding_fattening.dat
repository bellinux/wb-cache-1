40|$|Development of {{beef cattle}} {{agribusiness}} through partnership patternBeef cattle {{are the largest}} contributor of the ruminants to the national meat production, therefore cattle farming is potential to be developed. In Indonesia, cattle are raised traditionally by farmers as a family saving and as draught animal in land preparation. Beef cattle farming is commonly as a small-scale farming and consists of <b>breeding,</b> <b>fattening,</b> and integrated farming system with food crops or estate crops. Development of beef cattle agribusiness through partnership pattern could be an alternative approach in increasing farmers 2 ̆ 7 incomes and national meat production. Partnership is a cooperation between two or more partners in beef cattle farming in preproduction, production processes, and marketing based on equally and profitable principles. The development of beef catlle farming through partnership pattern is expected to meet the national demand for meat that continuously increases. On the other hand, the high demand for beef cattle meat gives an opportunity to develop beef cattle farming in the country through partnership to increase production and productivity. This paper reviewed the development of beef cattle farming through partnership pattern. To achieve the high farming efficiency, it is needed to manage the system integratedly from upstream to downstream by applying the agribusiness principles and partnership pattern to obtain the high and sustainable profit...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{swine fever}} (CSF) {{outbreaks}} can cause enormous losses in naïve pig populations. How to best minimize the economic damage {{and number of}} culled animals caused by CSF is therefore an important research area. The baseline CSF control strategy in the European Union and Switzerland consists of culling all animals in infected herds, movement restrictions for animals, material and people within a given distance to the infected herd and epidemiological tracing of transmission contacts. Additional disease control measures such as pre-emptive culling or vaccination have been recommended {{based on the results}} from several simulation models; however, these models were parameterized for areas with high animal densities. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore whether pre-emptive culling and emergency vaccination should also be recommended in low- to moderate-density areas such as Switzerland. Additionally, we studied the influence of initial outbreak conditions on outbreak severity to improve the efficiency of disease prevention and surveillance. A spatial, stochastic, individual-animal-based simulation model using all registered Swiss pig premises in 2009 (n= 9770) was implemented to quantify these relationships. The model simulates within-herd and between-herd transmission (direct and indirect contacts and local area spread). By varying the four parameters (a) control measures, (b) index herd type (<b>breeding,</b> <b>fattening,</b> weaning or mixed herd), (c) detection delay for secondary cases during an outbreak and (d) contact tracing probability, 112 distinct scenarios were simulated. To assess the impact of scenarios on outbreak severity, daily transmission rates were compared between scenarios. Compared with the baseline strategy (stamping out and movement restrictions) vaccination and pre-emptive culling neither reduced outbreak size nor duration. Outbreaks starting in a herd with weaning piglets or fattening pigs caused higher losses regarding to the number of culled premises and were longer lasting than those starting in the two other index herd types. Similarly, larger transmission rates were estimated for these index herd type outbreaks. A longer detection delay resulted in more culled premises and longer duration and better transmission tracing increased the number of short outbreaks. Based on the simulation results, baseline control strategies seem sufficient to control CSF in low-medium animal-dense areas. Early detection of outbreaks is crucial and risk-based surveillance should be focused on weaning piglet and fattening pig premises...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho ?? analisar a utiliza????o das Tecnologias da Informa????o M??veis e Sem Fio (TIMS) nos diferentes elos da cadeia bovina do estado de Goi??s, bem como identificar os desafios e oportunidades para o uso dessas tecnologias no contexto pesquisado. O m??todo utilizado foi o de estudo de caso ??nico, tendo como unidade de an??lise a cadeia da pecu??ria de corte do estado de Goi??s. A pesquisa ocorreu em duas etapas, uma explorat??ria e outra descritiva. Na etapa explorat??ria buscou-se familiaridade com o tema por meio de an??lise de estudos j?? publicados e pela realiza????o de oito (8) entrevistas semiestruturas com representantes das entidades de classe, certificadoras e fornecedores de TIMS. Na etapa descritiva realizou-se treze (13) entrevistas semi-estruturadas com representantes de onze empresas pertencentes aos elos (cria, recria, engorda, frigor??fico e trader) da cadeia para compreender o processo de ado????o ou n??o das TIMS. A an??lise dos resultados aponta que o frigor??fico ?? o elo mais forte dentro da cadeia. Que a falta de coordena????o da cadeia ?? um dificultador tanto para a rastreabilidade quanto para a utiliza????o de TIMS. Para esta cadeia, o entendimento de tecnologia compreende principalmente t??cnicas de manejo, irriga????o, melhoramento gen??tico e alimenta????o, isto ??, embora presentes, as TIMS n??o s??o percebidas como tecnologias priorit??rias para o funcionamento da cadeia. Problemas de infraestrutura b??sica, como energia el??trica e telecomunica????es, bem como a compreens??o das necessidades tecnol??gicas e informacionais das propriedades rurais, dificultam a implanta????o e ado????o das TIMS. A falta de regulamenta????o quanto ao uso de dispositivos eletr??nicos retarda a aplica????o dos brincos de RFID para garantir a rastreabilidade. O custo da tecnologia e a baixa qualifica????o da m??o de obra s??o tamb??m apontados como outros dificultadores de ado????o. Observa-se que ao mesmo tempo em que o sistema de rastreabilidade brasileiro estabelece rigorosos controles na operacionaliza????o, por outro lado d?? margem para controle tardio do rebanho. Percebe-se que a rastreabilidade ?? mais intensamente trabalhada no elo de engorda, elo mais pr??ximo ao frigor??fico. Tamb??m observa-se que o frigor??fico, por ser o elo com maior ???poder??? na cadeia e aquele que tem necessidade direta da rastreabilidade para atender ao mercado europeu exige a rastreabilidade, por??m os custos dessa rastreabilidade s??o de exclusiva responsabilidade dos pecuaristas. O pr??mio europa vem sendo reduzido de forma gradativa, desestimulando muitos produtores a manterem-se no sistema de rastreabilidade (SISBOV). No entanto, verificou-se que, al??m do seu poss??vel uso para rastreabilidade, e apesar de alguns fatores dificultadores para ado????o, a TI e as TIMS trazem diversos benef??cios para a gest??o das organiza????es na cadeia pesquisada, tais como: melhor controle de estoque, de custos individuais, de volume e tempo da produ????o, de previs??o de vendas, de produtividade dos funcion??rios, redu????o nos erros de lan??amento, aumento da efici??ncia do manejo, seguran??a para o acionista e melhoria na qualidade e disponibilidade da informa????o. The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the use of Wireless and Mobile Information Technology (TIMs, its acronym in Portuguese) in {{different}} links of the bovine chain in the state of Goi??s and to identify the challenges and opportunities to use these technologies in the studied context. The method used was a single case study that has as unity of analysis the chain of beef cattle in the state of Goi??s. The research was conducted in two stages: one exploratory and one descriptive. At the exploratory stage the objective was to become familiar with the topic through the analysis of published studies and through the completion of eight (8) semi-structured interviews with professional associations, certifying agencies and TIMs suppliers representatives. The descriptive stage held thirteen (13) semi-structured interviews with representatives from eleven companies belonging to the mentioned chain links (raising, <b>breeding,</b> <b>fattening,</b> frigorific and trader) in order to understand the process of the adoption or not adoption of TIMs. The analysis of the results points that frigorific is the strongest link of the chain. The lack of coordination is an impediment for both traceability and for the use of TIMs. For this chain, the understanding of the technology embraces mainly the management, irrigation, breeding and feeding techniques, this means that although TIMs are present, they are not perceived as priority technologies for the chain operation. Problems of basic infrastructure such as electricity and telecommunications, and the understanding of technological and information needs of rural properties hinder the implementation and adoption of TIMs. The lack of regulation regarding the use of electronic devices slows the application of the RFID earrings in order to ensure traceability. The technology costs and the low qualification of the workforce are also mentioned as hindering to adopt the technology. It is observed that at the same time the Brazilian traceability system establishes strict controls on the operation it gives room for late cattle control. One can notice that traceability is intensively worked at the fattening link, which is closer to the frigorific. It is also noticed that the frigorific, for being the most ???powerful??? link in the chain and the one with greater needs of the traceability to attend the European market demands the traceability, however the costs of this traceability are farmers??? responsibility. The Europe award has been reduced gradually, discouraging many farmers to remain in the traceability system (SISBOV). However, it was confirmed that besides its possible use to traceability, and despite some difficulties to adopt the technology, Information Technology and TIMs bring several benefits to the organizations management, such as better control of: inventory individual costs, time production volume, sales forecast, employee productivity, reduction in entry errors, increased efficiency of management, security for stockholders, and the improvement of quality and availability of the information...|$|E

The author examines family-based farms with sheep, upbringing, socialization and learning in communities of practice, and integrated academic and sociocultural forces in development. Sheep farming in the studied village is integrated into a sophisticated field of knowledge rooted in the local culture. An important aspect is the bidirectional support and knowledge exchange between experience-based and science-based knowledge centres (i. e. there is a two-way transfer) : the farmers supply external agricultural experts with data on <b>breeding</b> and <b>fattening,</b> and subsequently input their derived knowledge for further use in development.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Manure is {{no longer}} {{exclusively}} considered as a fertiliser in areas with high densities of farm animals. Efforts are being made to reduce mineral excretion or to stimulate a more environmental-friendly use. In such a context, both from the governmental side and for the producer, a reliable calculation of the on-farm production is very useful. Based on the balance between input (feed) - output (produced rabbits, dead rabbits), the nitrogen and phosphorus on farm excretion have been calculated for different production systems, production levels and slaughter weights. For a closed farm (<b>breeding</b> + <b>fattening)</b> the most convenient expression of mineral excretion is per female on average present on the farm. The excretion amounts to 7. 42 kg N and 4. 76 kg P 2 O 5 per doe/year on a commercial rabbit farm based on an average production/doe of 45 fatteners of 2. 5 kg. The excretion decreases from 76 to 61 g N and from 48 to 40 g P 2 O 5 /kg rabbit produced with increasing productivity of the farm (35 vs 50 delivered fatteners/doe/year, respectively). In an exclusively fattening unit (between 0. 8 and 2. 5 kg weight and a feed conversion ratio of 3. 40), the excretion amounts to 38 g N and 26 g P 2 O 5, per kg rabbit produced...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{determine}} the production systems of beef cattle which can generate the income of smallholder farmers. The {{study was conducted in}} Bantul and Sleman Regencies, Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia. In total of 210 beef cattle farmers were involved in semi structural interview. Data was collected in the dry season (July to September) of 2015.   Descriptive analysis was carried out for the demographic, social, economic characteristic of respondents and beef cattle farm practices. Enterprise budgeting of beef cattle farms was made to analyse farm profit, return to management and family labour {{that could be used in}} further planning for better business management. Beef cattle farming founded as an alternative that can be developed in rural communities. In order to generate the incomes in both systems, <b>breeding</b> and <b>fattening,</b> production system in term of feeding practices has to be improved so that the cost can be reduced. Scientific processing of manure has to be done for value addition in the farming system. Calving interval has to be improved in breeding system, that the best condition is 12 months and the existing condition on the respondents was 16 months. For fattening, optimizing the duration for fattening period less than 3. 6 months is the best improvement. Government policy is needed to improve beef farm economic condition especially in breeding farm...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Australian Beef supply chain and notes {{some of the}} major concerns expressed by agents in the supply chain. The paper then outlines the systems dynamics approach, its potential benefits and dangers and then discusses a simple model of the production process within the supply chain. We show how the systems modelling approach, utilizing the Vensim ® software application can be used to develop insights into operations of the supply chain. The paper closes with a discussion of the research direction in supply chain modelling that will be followed by this group. - 1 -Australian beef supply chain Beef supply chain management is the integration of beef producers, beef processors, retailers and end customers. The cattle move from feedlot/farms to processors who transform them into beef products and organise delivery into the hands of end customers. Smith (2001) indicates that this supply chain included: seedstock generators, cow/calf producers, stockers/backgrounders, feedlot operators, packers, processors, supermarket operators and food-service providers. In this paper we look at one section of the supply chain, the interaction between a generic supplier and the processor. Further work following from this paper will however consider the full supply chain, and we briefly describe this in the following section and in Figure 1. There are four stages of Australian beef supply chain framework: <b>Breeding,</b> backgrounding, <b>fattening</b> and feedlot...|$|R
40|$|Since 2008, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has {{assessed}} {{data on the}} prevalence of salmonella in flocks of breeding poultry, laying hens, broilers and turkeys. Published each year, the reports {{are part of an}} EU-wide programme to control salmonella. They are based on results from official surveillance by the federal states as well as own checks conducted by the food business operators themselves. Compared to the previous year, data for 2012 showed a similar or slightly decreased Salmonella prevalence for laying hens, broilers and breeding turkeys but an increase in the detected rates for <b>breeding</b> hens and <b>fattening</b> turkeys. In terms of the control-relevant serovars, the agreed target value was reached for all types of poultry covered by the control programmes.

50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century the market town of Volary {{consisted}} of 224 houses with 2069 German speaking inhabitants. Under the patronage of the authorities, the parish church of St Catherine {{and the school}} were built and maintained. There was also in a public chapel of St. Florian and a town hall. The main sources of income were agriculture, cattle <b>breeding</b> and cattle <b>fattening,</b> linen weaving {{and the production of}} yarns. Every year Volary sold about 400 steers to Prague. The deposited borough was surrounded by agriculturally used meadows with numerous wooden houses, hay barns and traditional alpine architecture which gave the area along with the special construction of the houses an alpine character. The mostly wooden houses of Volary were built on flat land, close to each other, combined with large stones, gabled roofs and gabled fronts.|$|R
40|$|Fattening rabbits are {{conventionally}} {{housed in}} 2 animals per cages, {{according to the}} local tradition. Presently in Europe no EU Directive exists on cage dimensions for these animals, while in some Countries local Codes (i. e. Ministry of Agriculture, U. K., 1987) indicate the housing dimensions for fattening rabbits (rabbits between 5 and 12 weeks of age: 0. 07 m 2 pro capite; rabbits above 12 weeks of age: 0. 18 m 2 pro capite in individual cages and rabbit between 5 and 12 weeks of age: 0. 09 m 2 in colony cages). The conventional housing system may negatively affect animals' welfare, both for <b>breeding</b> and for <b>fattening</b> rabbits (Verga, 2000). No abnormal behaviours have been shown in group-housed females (Gunn, 1994) while they {{have been found in}} males, because they may become more aggressive when reaching sexual maturity (Hackness and Wagner, 1989) [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Trypanosoma vivax {{outbreaks}} in {{beef cattle}} in the Pantanal region of Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil, causes relevant economical impact due to weight loss, abortion and mortality. Cattle {{moved from the}} Pantanal to adjacent areas of this ecosystem for <b>breeding</b> and <b>fattening</b> is a common feature. Therefore an epidemiological study on breeding cows in the transition area between Pantanal lowland and adjacent highlands of Mato Grosso do Sul was performed to determine the T. vivax infection dynamics and outbreak risk. Three experimental groups were formed: Group 1 consisted of cows parasitologically negative by the Woo test and in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for T. vivax antibody detection (Tv-ELISA-Ab); Group 2 parasitologically negative and positive in the Tv-ELISA-Ab; and in Group 3 cows were parasitologically positive and with positive reactions in the Tv-ELISA-Ab. During 24 months, the cows' dislodgment between the above established groups was monitored by Woo test and Tv-ELISA-Ab exams. The tabanid population was also monitored and the highest number occurred during the rainy season. Although parasitemias were detected only {{in the first four}} samplings of the experimental period, the cows could be considered as trypanotolerant, because no clinical signs were observed. Despite the higher T. vivax incidence during the dry season, no disease symptoms were seen. Even though T. vivax epidemiological situation in the herd was characterized as endemic with seasonal variation, the probability of outbreaks was null within the conditions of the study...|$|R
40|$|Several {{bacteria}} {{belonging to}} the family Pasteurellaceae are potential pathogens in rabbits. In particular, Pasteurella multocida {{is considered to be}} important, and outbreaks caused by this species result in considerable economic losses in rabbitries. However, Pasteurellaceae spp. isolated from rabbits are poorly characterized, and thus, proper identification of P. multocida isolates from these animals is problematic and often unsatisfactory, thereby hampering epidemiological investigations. Therefore, 228 isolates from rabbit populations originating from a <b>breeding</b> and <b>fattening</b> organization with group management and postmortem cases with pasteurellosis from individual owners were phenotypically and genotypically analyzed using biochemical tests and repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction (REP-PCR). Furthermore, 41 samples representing observed phenotypes were selected for phylogenetic analysis using 16 S ribosomal RNA and rpoB genes. The REP-PCR typing and phylogenetic analyses correlated well and appeared to be distinct molecular methods for characterization of rabbit isolates. Phenotyping, however, diverged from molecular recognition, reflecting the problematic conventional diagnosis of these strains. The fermentation of sorbitol appeared to be an imprecise indicator for P. multocida subspecies classification. According to REP-PCR and sequencing results, 82 % of the isolates were characterized as P. multocida subsp. multocida, 3 % as P. multocida subsp. septica, and 5 % as P. multocida. Further, 5 % were identified as Pasteurella canis. The other 5 % represented a homogeneous group of unknown species {{belonging to the}} Pasteurellaceae. Samples obtained from individual postmortem cases demonstrated a higher phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity than samples from group management rabbits...|$|R
