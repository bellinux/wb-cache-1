Maurer and Schulz had been classmates at Minneapolis College of Art and Design (MCAD) and remained lifelong friends.

Shultz would name Linus van Pelt, who is known for his blue security blanket in the Peanuts comic strip, after his friend and colleague. He would later wrote in a <b>book</b> <b>marking</b> the 50th anniversary of Peanuts, [...] "Linus came from a drawing that I made one day of a face almost like the one he now has...I experimented with some wild hair, and showed the sketch to {{a friend of mine who}} sat near me at art instruction, whose name was Linus Maurer.

5000|$|The {{history of}} black women in America was long untold. In the last {{decades of the twentieth}} century, that began to change with books such as But Some of Us Are Brave (Feminist Press, 1982), edited by Gloria T. Hull, Patricia Bell-Scott, and Barbara Smith; Paula Giddings' When and Where I Enter (Harper Collins, 1984) and Deborah Gray White's Ar'nt I a Woman (W. W. Norton, 1985), as well as many others. In the 1990s, {{historian}} Darlene Clark Hine published widely in the field and encouraged the work of other scholars with publications such as the series Black Women in United States History. (Carlson Publishing, 1990) and Black Women in America: An Historical Encyclopedia (Carlson Publishing, 1992), which she edited with Elsa Barkley Brown and Rosalyn Terborg-Penn. After working with Hine on a young adult version of Black Women in America, Kathleen Thompson co-authored with her A Shining Thread of Hope. This was the first narrative history {{of black women}} in America and was hailed by Cornel West as [...] "a canonical text for American historians." [...] Historian Nell Irvin Painter said, [...] ""From time to time, a work of history itself makes history.

50|$|She {{graduated}} from the High School of Art and Design in 1970, focused on directing, and studied film at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. Her father made just slightly over the cut-off for financial aid for the school so Heckerling had {{to take out a}} large loan to cover her expenses. She claims this caused considerable stress in her life, and she was unable to pay them off until the end of her twenties. When Heckerling was in high school and focused on directing, her father was opposed to the idea, wishing that she had chosen a more practical aspiration. Despite this, he gave her Parker Tyler's book Classics of the Foreign Film: A Pictoral Legacy. Heckerling pored over the <b>book,</b> <b>marking</b> off films that she had seen as she went, until she had watched almost all of them. She claims that by the time she got to NYU, because of this book, she had seen almost all of the films that they had to watch in her classes. Though Heckerling considered her time at NYU to be a great time where she learned a lot and made great connections, such as Martin Brest and noted screenwriter and satirist Terry Southern who was one of her professors, she later reflects on her time at the school as sloppy and unprofessional, claiming that she used very low-quality equipment and had a lot of technical problems.|$|E

5000|$|Danziger had {{a longstanding}} {{interest}} {{in the history of}} psychology and began intensive study of primary sources in the early 1970s. He became particularly interested in Wilhelm Wundt's work. Around the time of psychology’s [...] "centennial", marking the establishment of Wundt’s laboratory in 1879, Danziger published a number of chapters and articles related to this topic (e.g. Danziger, 1979a). However, during the 1980s, he became increasingly interested in the history of psychological research methods (e.g. Danziger, 1985). This interest culminated in what is probably Danziger’s best-known book,Constructing the Subject: Historical Origins of Psychological Research (Danziger, 1990). Danziger was also interested in the history of psychological concepts and categories, and in a later book, Naming the Mind: How Psychology Found Its Language (Danziger, 1997), he traced the historical origins of modern psychological concepts like [...] "behavior", [...] "intelligence", [...] "attitude", [...] "personality" [...] and [...] "motivation". He continued this line of work in his <b>book,</b> <b>Marking</b> the Mind: A History of Memory (Danziger, 2008). The book is a wide-ranging history of the concept from Ancient Greece to the present. Much of the book consists of what Danziger calls 'historical psychology'. This field is to be distinguished from history of psychology in that it is concerned not so much with the theories and practices of psychologists but with the subject-matter of psychology and this sometimes has a longer history than the discipline itself (Danziger, 2003).|$|E
