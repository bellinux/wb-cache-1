5|$|Its {{brightest}} star, Capella, is {{an unusual}} multiple star system among the <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> in the night sky. Beta Aurigae is an interesting variable star in the constellation; Epsilon Aurigae, a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter Milky Way, Auriga has many bright open clusters in its borders, including M36, M37, and M38, popular targets for amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent nebula, the Flaming Star Nebula, associated with the variable star AE Aurigae.|$|E
5|$|The cluster {{core radius}} is about 8 light years and tidal radius is about 43 light years. The cluster {{contains}} over 1,000 statistically confirmed members, although this figure excludes unresolved binary stars. Its light {{is dominated by}} young, hot blue stars, up to 14 {{of which can be}} seen with the naked eye depending on local observing conditions. The arrangement of the <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> is somewhat similar to Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. The total mass contained in the cluster is estimated to be about 800 solar masses and is dominated by fainter and redder stars.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} named after Spica, a binary star system in the {{constellation}} Virgo {{and one of the}} <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> in the nighttime sky. It appears as one star because of the relatively low center-to-center distance between the two component stars, estimated at an average of 11 million miles (17.7 million km). Astronomical observations also suggest that there may be additional stars in the Spica system. In the story, Asumi mentions Spica's distance to Earth as 350 light-years. This figure is also cited by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; however, other sources indicate a distance of approximately 260 light-years.|$|E
5|$|Although fainter {{than its}} {{northern}} counterpart, the oval- or horseshoe-shaped pattern of its brighter stars renders it distinctive. Alpha and Beta Coronae Australis {{are the two}} <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> with an apparent magnitude of around 4.1. Epsilon Coronae Australis is the brightest example of a W Ursae Majoris variable in the southern sky. Lying alongside the Milky Way, Corona Australis contains one of the closest star-forming regions to the Solar System—a dusty dark nebula known as the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, lying about 430 light years away. Within it are stars at the earliest stages of their lifespan. The variable stars R and TY Coronae Australis light up parts of the nebula, which varies in brightness accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Lynx is a {{constellation}} {{named after the}} animal, usually observed in the northern sky. The constellation {{was introduced in the}} late 17th century by Johannes Hevelius. It is a faint constellation, with its <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> forming a zigzag line. The orange giant Alpha Lyncis is the brightest star in the constellation, and the semiregular variable star Y Lyncis is a target for amateur astronomers. Six star systems have been found to contain planets. Those of 6 Lyncis and HD 75898 were discovered by the Doppler method; those of XO-2, XO-4, XO-5 and WASP-13 were observed as they passed in front of the host star.|$|E

5|$|The {{cluster is}} {{dominated}} by hot blue and extremely luminous stars that have formed within the last 100 million years. Dust that forms a faint reflection nebulosity around the <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> was thought at first to be {{left over from the}} formation of the cluster (hence the alternative name Maia Nebula after the star Maia), but is now known to be an unrelated dust cloud in the interstellar medium, through which the stars are currently passing. Computer simulations have shown that the Pleiades were probably formed from a compact configuration that resembled the Orion Nebula. Astronomers estimate that the cluster will survive for about another 250 million years, after which it will disperse due to gravitational interactions with its galactic neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Ursa Minor is {{bordered by}} Camelopardalis to the west, Draco to the west, and Cepheus to the east. Covering 256square degrees, it ranks 56th of the 88 constellations in size. Ursa Minor is colloquially {{known in the}} US as the Little Dipper because its seven <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> seem to form {{the shape of a}} dipper (ladle or scoop). The star {{at the end of the}} dipper handle is Polaris. Polaris can also be found by {{following}} a line through the two stars—Alpha and Beta Ursae Majoris—that form the end of the 'bowl' of the Big Dipper, for 30 degrees (three upright fists at arms' length) across the night sky. The four stars constituting the bowl of the Little Dipper are of second, third, fourth, and fifth magnitudes, and provide an easy guide to determining what magnitude stars are visible, useful for city dwellers or testing one's eyesight.|$|E
5|$|M36 (NGC 1960) {{is a young}} galactic {{open cluster}} with {{approximately}} 60 stars, {{most of which are}} relatively bright; however, only about 40 stars are visible in most amateur instruments. It is at a distance of 3,900 light-years and has an overall magnitude of 6.0; it is 14 light-years wide. Its apparent diameter is 12.0 arcminutes. Of the three open clusters in Auriga, M36 is both the smallest and the most concentrated, though its <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> are approximately 9th magnitude. It was discovered in 1749 by Guillaume Le Gentil, the first of Auriga's major open clusters to be discovered. M36 features a 10-arcminute-wide knot of bright stars in its center, anchored by Struve 737, a double star with components separated by 10.7 arcseconds. Most of the stars in M36 are B type stars with rapid rates of rotation. M36's Trumpler class is given as both I 3 r and II 3 m. Besides the central knot, most of the cluster's other stars appear in smaller knots and groups.|$|E
25|$|In {{keeping with}} {{the pattern of the}} naming the Algol-class ships after <b>bright</b> <b>stars,</b> Algol was named after the <b>bright</b> eclipsing binary <b>star</b> Algol, known colloquially as the Demon Star, which is a <b>bright</b> <b>star</b> in the {{constellation}} Perseus.|$|R
25|$|Greek {{letters are}} used to denote the <b>brighter</b> <b>stars</b> {{within each of the}} eighty-eight constellations. In most constellations the <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> is {{designated}} Alpha and the next brightest Beta etc. For example, the <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in the constellation of Centaurus is known as Alpha Centauri. For historical reasons, the Greek designations of some constellations begin with a lower ranked letter.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th century, John Flamsteed {{numbered}} the <b>brighter</b> <b>stars</b> in each constellation {{from west}} to east, and 1 Geminorum {{was the first}} star listed in Gemini.

5|$|Thorpe {{was the son}} and {{grandson}} of Conservative MPs, but decided to align with the small and ailing Liberal Party. After studying at Oxford University {{he became one of}} the Liberals' <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> in the 1950s. He entered parliament at the age of 30, made a rapid mark, and was elected party leader in 1967. After an uncertain start during which the party lost ground, Thorpe capitalised on the growing unpopularity of the Conservative and Labour parties to lead the Liberals through a period of notable electoral success. This culminated in the general election of February 1974, when the party won 6 million votes. Under the first-past-the-post electoral system this gave them only 14 seats, but with the election having resulted in a hung parliament with no party having an overall majority, Thorpe was in a strong position. He was offered a cabinet post by the Conservative prime minister, Edward Heath, if he would bring the Liberals into a coalition. His price for such a deal, reform of the electoral system, was rejected by Heath, who resigned in favour of a minority Labour government.|$|E
5|$|M38 is a diffuse {{open cluster}} at a {{distance}} of 3,900 light-years, the least concentrated of the three main open clusters in Auriga; it is classified as a Trumpler Class II 2 r or III 2 r cluster because of this. It appears as a cross-shaped or pi-shaped object in a telescope and contains approximately 100 stars; its overall magnitude is 6.4. M38, like M36, was discovered by Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749. It has an apparent diameter of approximately 20 arcseconds and a true diameter of about 25 light-years. Unlike M36 or M37, M38 has a varied stellar population. The majority of the population consists of A and B type main sequence stars, the B type stars being the oldest members, and a number of G type giant stars. One yellow-hued G type star is the brightest star in M38 at a magnitude of 7.9. The <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> in M38 are magnitude 9 and 10. M38 is accompanied by NGC 1907, a smaller and dimmer cluster that lies half a degree south-southwest of M38; it is {{at a distance}} of 4,200 light-years. The smaller cluster has an overall magnitude of 8.2 and a diameter of 6.0 arcminutes, making it about a third the size of M38. However, NGC 1907 is a rich cluster, classified as a Trumpler Class I 1 m n cluster. It has approximately 12 stars of magnitude 9–10, and at least 25 stars of magnitude 9–12.|$|E
