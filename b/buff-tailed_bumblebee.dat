25|$|Waste {{material}} is removed continuously and deposited in refuse piles as above (or even by some Atta ants into streams). The {{division of labour}} in Acromyrmex echinatior leafcutter ants includes individuals who work almost exclusively in waste management: waste material (excreta, food refuse, etc.) frequently harbours Escovopsis (a microfungus that is parasitic on the fungus that A. echinatior tends) {{as well as other}} parasites, so spatial separation of waste material from the fungal garden and wider nest environment is of paramount importance. This is achieved by depositing waste material on downhill and downwind piles or in special deep underground refuse chambers. Distinct waste management workers also exist in Atta cephalotes and Atta colombica. The risk of waste-worker ants contaminating the fungal garden/nest is lowered by other ants attacking them if they try to enter the nest, whilst attacks are more frequent in species with internal refuse chambers (this also reinforces the division of labour). On the other hand, some species retain excreta and/or anal exudates within the nest to utilize it for antiparasite purposes: C. formosanus employs its faces as building material for the nest carton, the use of faceal material promotes the growth of Actinobacteria with natural antimicrobial activity (e.g. Streptomyces), combating fungal parasites like M. anisopliae. Colony members of the <b>buff-tailed</b> <b>bumblebee</b> (Bombus terrestris) defend themselves against the virulent Crithidia bombi parasite by consuming beneficial gut bacteria from the faces of conspecific after eclosing.|$|E

5|$|Bumblebees are Northern Hemisphere animals. When {{red clover}} was {{introduced}} as a crop to New Zealand {{in the nineteenth}} century, it {{was found to have}} no local pollinators, and clover seed had accordingly to be imported each year. Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators. In 1885 and 1886 the Canterbury Acclimatization Society brought in 442 queens, of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied. As planned, red clover was soon being produced from locally-grown seed. Bumblebees are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in greenhouses. The New Zealand population of <b>buff-tailed</b> <b>bumblebees</b> naturally colonised Tasmania, 1,500 miles away, in 1992.|$|R
5|$|Bumblebees are {{important}} pollinators of both crops and wildflowers. Because bumblebees do not overwinter the entire colony, {{they do not}} stockpile honey, and therefore are not useful as honey producers. Bumblebees are increasingly cultured for agricultural use as pollinators, among other reasons because they can pollinate plants such as tomato in greenhouses by buzz pollination whereas other pollinators cannot. Commercial production began in 1987, when Roland De Jonghe founded the Biobest company; in 1988 they produced enough nests to pollinate 40 hectares of tomatoes. The industry grew quickly, starting with other companies in the Netherlands. Bumblebee nests, mainly of <b>buff-tailed</b> <b>bumblebees,</b> are produced in at least 30 factories around the world; over a million nests are grown annually in Europe; Turkey is a major producer.|$|R
40|$|Flying insects {{frequently}} navigate through environments {{of different}} complexity. In this study, <b>buff-tailed</b> <b>bumblebees</b> (Bombus terrestris L.) {{were trained to}} fly along tunnels of different widths, from 60 to 240 cm. In tunnel widths of 60 and 120 cm, bumblebees control their lateral position by balancing the magnitude of translational optic flow experienced in the lateral visual field of each eye. In wider tunnels, bumblebees use translational optic flow cues in the ventral visual field to control their lateral position and to steer along straight tracks. Our results also suggest that bumblebees prefer to fly over surfaces that provide strong ventral optic flow cues, rather than over featureless ones. Together, these strategies allow bumblebees {{to minimize the risk}} of collision and to maintain relatively straight flight paths in a broad range of environments...|$|R

50|$|Bombus terrestris, the <b>buff-tailed</b> <b>bumblebee</b> {{or large}} earth bumblebee, {{is one of}} the most {{numerous}} bumblebee species in Europe.

The oocysts were found in Italy in the garden bumblebee (B. hortorum) and the <b>buff-tailed</b> <b>bumblebee</b> (B. terrestris) and in 1990, in Finland, were found in a single specimen of the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Further finds were made in Italy {{over the next few}} years with the level of infection in Bombus species being considered low and that in A. mellifera sporadic. With specimens being found in Canada, France, Italy, Finland and Switzerland, it is likely that the parasite is cosmopolitan in distribution and will be identified in other countries.|$|E

This secretion acts as a marking and luring pheromone during patrolling. This study is focused on oxidation of terpene alcohols using enzymes of cephalic labial gland of a bumblebee. In vitro incubations were accomplished with homogenate of cephalic labial gland and a various substrates: E,E-farnesol, geraniol, 2, 3 -dihydrofarnesol, hexadecanol. Conditions of incubations and following analysis using gas chromatography were optimized.

40|$|Bumblebees are ecologically and {{economically}} important as pollinators of crop and wild plants, especially in temperate systems. Species, {{such as the}} <b>buff-tailed</b> <b>bumblebee</b> (Bombus terrestris), are reared commercially to pollinate high value crops. Their highly specific gut microbiota, characterised by low diversity, may affect nutrition and immunity {{and are likely to}} be important for fitness and colony health. However, little is known about how environmental factors affect bacterial community structure. We analyzed the gut microbiota from three groups of worker bumblebees (B. terrestris) from distinct colonies that varied in rearing and foraging characteristics: commercially reared with restricted foraging (RR); commercially reared with outside foraging (RF); and wild-caught workers (W). Contrary to previous studies, which indicate that bacterial communities are highly conserved across workers, we found that RF individuals had an intermediate community structure compared to RR and W types. Further, this was shaped by differences in the abundances of common OTUs and the diversity of rare OTUs present which we propose results from an increase in the variety of carbohydrates obtained through foraging...|$|E
40|$|Bombus terrestris, {{commonly}} known as the <b>buff-tailed</b> <b>bumblebee,</b> is native to Europe, parts of Africa and Asia. It is commercially bred for use as a pollinator of greenhouse crops. Larvae pupate within a silken cocoon that they construct from proteins produced in modified salivary glands. The amino acid composition and protein structure of hand drawn B. terrestris, silk fibres was investigated through the use of micro-Raman spectroscopy. Spectra were obtained from single fibres drawn from the larvae salivary gland at a rate of 0. 14 cm/s. Raman spectroscopy enabled the identification of poly(alanine), poly(alanine-glycine), phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine, which is consistent with the results of amino acid analysis. The dominant protein conformation was found to be coiled coil (73 %) while the β-sheet content of 10 % is, as expected, lower than those reported for hornets and ants. Polarized Raman spectra revealed that the coiled coils were highly aligned along the fibre axis while the β-sheet and random coil components had their peptide carbonyl groups roughly perpendicular to the fibre axis. The protein orientation distribution is compared to those of other natural and recombinant silks. A structural model for the B. terrestris silk fibre is proposed based on these results...|$|E
40|$|Bumblebees {{demonstrate}} {{an extensive}} {{capacity for learning}} complex motor skills to maximise exploitation of floral rewards. This ability is well studied in nectar collection but its role in pollen foraging is less well understood. Floral sonication is used by bees to extract pollen from some plant species with anthers which must be vibrated (buzzed) to release pollen. Pollen removal is determined by sonication characteristics including frequency and amplitude, and thus the ability to optimise sonication should allow bees to maximise the pollen collection. We investigated {{the ability of the}} <b>buff-tailed</b> <b>bumblebee</b> (Bombus terrestris) to modify the frequency and amplitude of their buzzes with increasing experience manipulating flowers of the buzz-pollinated plantSolanum rostratum. We analysed flight and feeding vibrations generated by naïve workers across feeding bouts. Feeding buzzes were of a higher frequency and a lower amplitude than flight buzzes. Both flight and feeding buzzes had reduced amplitudes with increasing number of foraging trips. However, the frequency of their feeding buzzes was reduced significantly more than their flight buzzes as bumblebee workers gained experience manipulating flowers. These results suggest that bumblebees are able to modify the characteristics of their buzzes with experience manipulating buzz-pollinated flowers. We discuss our findings in the context of bumblebee learning, and the current understanding of the optimal sonication characteristics for releasing pollen in buzz-pollinated species. Our results present a tantalising insight into the potential role of learning in floral sonication, paving the way for future research in this area...|$|E
40|$|This PhD thesis {{consists}} of two main parts. The first part focused on further unraveling the venom composition of the honeybee (A. mellifera) and bumblebee (B. terrestris) by integrating genome, transcriptome and proteome information. Second, this work aimed to advance knowledge about the immunological implications of the venom proteome by investigating the allergenic properties of immunologically uncharacterized venom compounds and by analyzing the immunological relevance of allergen protein heterogeneity. In chapter 1, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify novel honeybee venom compounds, an approach which overcomes the issues of gel-based proteomics. In addition, we investigated if the antigen 5 -like sequence, previously found by mining the honeybee genome, is expressed by the honeybee venom glands. Finally, we tried to confirm the presence of novel identified compounds and the antigen 5 -like compound in the venom by analyzing their IgG 4 -reactivity using sera of immune beekeepers. In chapter 2 we explored the hidden honeybee venom proteome by integrating a combinatorial peptide ligand library venom pre-treatment with FTMS, while in chapter 3 the venom proteome of the European <b>buff-tailed</b> <b>bumblebee,</b> B. terrestris, was unraveled using an identical approach. Also genome information was used to obtain further insights in the venom composition of both species. In chapter 4 we investigated the nature of Api m 10 protein heterogeneity and explored its effect on IgE-reactivity using sera of honeybee venom allergic patients.

40|$|Understanding {{the social}} {{evolution}} leading to insect eusociality requires, among other, a detailed insight into endocrine regulatory mechanisms {{that have been}} co-opted from solitary ancestors to play new roles in the complex life histories of eusocial species. Bumblebees represent well-suited models of a relatively primitive social organization standing on the mid-way to highly advanced eusociality and their queens undergo both, a solitary and a social phase, separated by winter diapause. In the present paper, we characterize the gene expression levels of major endocrine regulatory pathways across tissues, sexes, and life-stages of the <b>buff-tailed</b> <b>bumblebee,</b> Bombus terrestris, with special emphasis on critical stages of the queen’s transition from solitary to social life. We focused on fundamental genes of three pathways: (1) Forkhead box protein O and insulin/insulin-like signaling, (2) Juvenile hormone signaling, and (3) Adipokinetic hormone signaling. Virgin queens were distinguished by higher expression of forkhead box protein O and downregulated insulin-like peptides and juvenile hormone (JH) signaling, indicated by low expression of methyl farnesoate epoxidase (MFE) and transcription factor Krüppel homolog 1 (Kr-h 1). Diapausing queens showed the expected downregulation of JH signaling in terms of low MFE and vitellogenin (Vg) expressions, but an unexpectedly high expression of Kr-h 1. By contrast, reproducing queens revealed an upregulation of MFE and Vg together with insulin signaling. Surprisingly, the {{insulin growth factor 1}} (IGF- 1) {{turned out to be a}} queen-specific hormone. Workers exhibited an expression pattern of MFE and Vg similar to that of reproducing queens. Males were characterized by high Kr-h 1 expression and low Vg level. The tissue comparison unveiled an unexpected resemblance between the fat body and hypopharyngeal glands across all investigated genes, sexes, and life stages...|$|E
40|$|More {{efficient}} {{selection is}} expected for haploid-expressed genes compared diploidexpressed genes. This is because recessive mutations can be masked from selection by a dominant allele in diploids but are always exposed to selection in haploids. The {{significance of this}} effect for haplodiploids was recognised by White in 1945, who predicted less efficient selection on genes with diploid-limited expression. I present the first empirical support for these predictions for haplodiploids on the <b>buff-tailed</b> <b>bumblebee,</b> Bombus terrestris. I found evidence for weaker purifying selection on diploid-biased genes compared to haploid-expressed genes. This has led to higher protein divergence rates and polymorphism levels in diploid-biased genes compared to haploid-expressed genes. In contrast, I {{found no evidence of}} greater positive selection on haploid-expressed genes, suggesting that most new, recessive mutations may be deleterious. In a second experiment I tested the effect of ploidy-specific selection in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana by comparing selection patterns between haploid pollen genes and diploid sporophytic genes. I detected evidence for a change in selection patterns possibly due to a loss of self-incompatibility. Divergence data indicate stronger positive selection within pollen genes during a period dominated by outcrossing, likely caused by pollen competition and haploid selection. Polymorphism data, on the other hand, reveal signs of relaxed selection within pollen genes, possibly due to high homozygosity levels, which reduce pollen competition and the masking of recessive mutations in diploid genes. In a third study I used the data produced for determining ploidy-biased genes in B. terrestris to infer expression patterns involved in caste determination. This is the first broad scale analysis on caste determination in bumblebees. One major finding was that the expression patterns of bumblebee workers more closely resemble those of queens when reproductive compared to higher eusocial Hymenoptera, possibly due to the more plastic nature of bumblebee worker castes...|$|E
40|$|The nuclear receptors (NRs), an {{important}} protein superfamily of transcription factors {{found in all}} animals, regulate the expression of genes in a large array of biological processes. Their involvement in moulting and metamorphosis, embryonic development, cell differentiation and reproduction of arthropods is well documented. Especially the two NRs that form the functional ecdysteroid receptor and which are {{at the base of}} the ecdysteroid signalling cascade regulating moulting and metamorphosis, EcR and USP, have been researched intensively. During evolution, gene duplication and gene loss events have created a broad diversity of these NRs between different groups in the animal kingdom. However, in 2008, at the time this PhD research started, the information that was available on arthropod NRs was mainly restricted to holometabolic insects. Complete sets of NRs for other groups, including Crustacea, Chelicerata or more basal insects were unavailable. Over the last few years, the number of genome sequencing projects that are carried out for Arthropoda is rapidly increasing. This gave us the opportunity to investigate the NRs in a number of other arthropods and compare the sets of NRs between some of these groups. We chose three species, the hemimetabolic pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, the holometabolic <b>buff-tailed</b> <b>bumblebee</b> Bombus terrestris and the chelicerate two-spotted spidermite Tetranychus urticae as representatives of their respective clades. The main research questions that were addressed in the PhD thesis were: (1) Do holometabolic, hemimetabolic and non-insect arthropods exhibit important differences in their sets of nuclear receptors?, (2) What are the consequences towards the ecdysteroid signalling cascade and can any differences be found there?, and (3) Can RNAi be used to add functional information to the fundamental data that these genome annotation analyses have delivered...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Understanding polyphenism, {{the ability}} of a single genome to express {{multiple}} morphologically and behaviourally distinct phenotypes, is an important goal for evolutionary and developmental biology. Polyphenism has been key to the evolution of the Hymenoptera, and particularly the social Hymenoptera where the genome of a single species regulates distinct larval stages, sexual dimorphism and physical castes within the female sex. Transcriptomic analyses of social Hymenoptera will therefore provide unique insights into how changes in gene expression underlie such complexity. Here we describe gene expression in individual specimens of the pre-adult stages, sexes and castes of the key pollinator, the <b>buff-tailed</b> <b>bumblebee</b> Bombus terrestris. Results cDNA was prepared from mRNA from five life cycle stages (one larva, one pupa, one male, one gyne and two workers) and a total of 1, 610, 742 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated using Roche 454 technology, substantially increasing the sequence data available for this important species. Overlapping ESTs were assembled into 36, 354 B. terrestris putative transcripts, and functionally annotated. A preliminary assessment of differences in gene expression across non-replicated specimens from the pre-adult stages, castes and sexes was performed using R-STAT analysis. Individual samples from the life cycle stages of the bumblebee differed in the expression of a wide array of genes, including genes involved in amino acid storage, metabolism, immunity and olfaction. Conclusions Detailed analyses of immune and olfaction gene expression across phenotypes demonstrated how transcriptomic analyses can inform our understanding of processes central to the biology of B. terrestris and the social Hymenoptera in general. For example, examination of immunity-related genes identified high conservation of important immunity pathway components across individual specimens from the life cycle stages while olfactory-related genes exhibited differential expression with a wider repertoire of gene expression within adults, especially sexuals, in comparison to immature stages. As there is an absence of replication across the samples, {{the results of this study}} are preliminary but provide a number of candidate genes which may be related to distinct phenotypic stage expression. This comprehensive transcriptome catalogue will provide an important gene discovery resource for directed programmes in ecology, evolution and conservation of a key pollinator. </p...|$|E
40|$|Bumblebees have {{undergone}} dramatic declines both in Britain and further afield {{during the last}} century. Bumblebees provide a crucial pollination service to both crops and wild flowers. For these reasons, they have received {{a great deal of}} research attention over the years. However, the ecology of wild bumblebee nests and the interactions between nests and other species, particularly vertebrates has been somewhat understudied. This is largely due to the difficulty in finding sufficient nests for well replicated study and a lack of appropriate methods of observation. Here, methods for locating bumblebee nests were trialled. It was found that a specially trained bumblebee nest detection dog did not discover nests any faster than people who had received minimal instruction. Numbers of nest site searching queens provide a reliable indication of suitable nesting habitat (i. e. places where nests {{are more likely to be}} found). In order to investigate aspects of bumblebee nesting ecology wild nests were observed by filming or regular observations by either researchers or members of the public. Some <b>buff-tailed</b> <b>bumblebee</b> (Bombus terrestris) nests were collected and all the bumblebees were genotyped to identify any foreign individuals. A review of British mammalian dietary literature was conducted to identify those that predate bumblebees. Great tits (Parus major) were filmed predating bumblebees at nests and it was clear from the literature and observations that badger (Meles meles), pine martens (Martes martes) and hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) predate bumblebee nests, as well as the wax moth (Aphomia sociella). No evidence for predation by any other vertebrate species was found. Behaviours recorded included parasitism by Psithyrus, apparent nectar theft and possible usurpation by true bumblebees, egg-dumping by foreign queens and drifting and drifter reproduction by foreign workers. These events may cause harm to colonies (for example, through horizontal transmission of pathogens, or exploitation of the host nest’s resources). Alternatively where for example, usurpation by true bumblebees, egg-dumping or drifting is successful, these alternative reproductive strategies may increase the effective population size by enabling a single nest to produce reproductives of more than one breeding female. These data found that wild buff-tailed bumblebees (B. terrestris) nests with a greater proportion of workers infected with Crithidia bombi were less likely to produce gynes than those with fewer infected workers. Gyne production also varied dramatically between years. There is a growing body of evidence that a class of frequently used insecticides called neonicotinoids are negatively impacting bumblebees. An experiment was conducted using commercial colonies of buff-tailed bumblebees (B. terrestris) which were fed pollen and nectar which had been treated with the neonicotinoid imidacloprid at field realistic, sub-lethal levels. Treated colonies, produced 85 - 90...|$|E
