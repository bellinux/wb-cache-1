5|$|Honey <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> {{affected}} by parasites including acarine and Varroa mites. However, some <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> {{believed to have}} a mutualistic relationship with mites.|$|E
5|$|Apples are self-incompatible; {{they must}} cross-pollinate to develop fruit. During the {{flowering}} each season, apple growers often utilize pollinators to carry pollen. Honey <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> most commonly used. Orchard mason <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> also used as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. Bumblebee queens are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in enough quantity {{to be significant}} pollinators.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> polylectic (generalist) {{meaning they}} collect pollen {{from a range}} of {{flowering}} plants, however, some are oligoleges (specialists), in that they only gather pollen from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants. Specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen, and male orchid bees, which gather aromatic compounds from orchids (one of the few cases where male <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> effective pollinators). <b>Bees</b> <b>are</b> able to sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers, floral odors, and even electromagnetic fields. Once landed, a bee then uses nectar quality and pollen taste to determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers.|$|E
40|$|Measuring the {{diversity}} of <b>bees</b> <b>was</b> provided in two rapeseed fields (Dešenice, Miletice) in western Bohemia, where various species of <b>bees</b> <b>were</b> caught at eight different locations during two periods (March - April, May June). The <b>bees</b> <b>were</b> collected by using Moerickeho cups (yellow traps) with a concentrated solution of water and detergent...|$|R
50|$|Conopid flies also parasitize B. bimaculatus. Male <b>bees</b> <b>were</b> {{less likely}} to be parasitized than workers, and larger <b>bees</b> <b>were</b> more likely to be parasitized than smaller bees.|$|R
50|$|The honey <b>bee</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} few {{invertebrate}} {{animals to}} have been domesticated. Wild honey was collected by man in the Palaeolithic or Mesolithic periods, with evidence from rock art from France and Spain around 8,000 years old. <b>Bees</b> <b>were</b> likely first domesticated in ancient Egypt, where beekeeping is depicted in tomb paintings. <b>Bees</b> <b>were</b> brought to North America in 1622.|$|R
5|$|Stingless <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> {{also highly}} eusocial. They {{practise}} mass provisioning, with complex nest architecture and perennial colonies also established via swarming.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bees</b> <b>are</b> also mimicked by {{plants such}} as the bee orchid which imitates both the {{appearance}} and the scent of a female bee; male bees attempt to mate (pseudocopulation) with the furry lip of the flower, thus pollinating it.|$|E
5|$|Honey <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> used commercially {{to produce}} honey. They also produce some {{substances}} used as dietary supplements with possible health benefits, pollen, propolis, and royal jelly, though {{all of these}} can also cause allergic reactions.|$|E
50|$|Megachile perihirta, {{commonly}} known as the Western leafcutting <b>bee,</b> <b>is</b> a <b>bee</b> in the genus Megachile. The <b>bee</b> <b>is</b> native to western North America, ranging from Nebraska to Texas and Mexico, west to California, and north to British Columbia and Alberta, and often inhabits meadows and orchards. The <b>bee</b> <b>is</b> black with long whitish-yellow hair, more so below the thorax and abdomen. The abdomen, however, is mostly bare, although each segment has scattered whitish hair. The wings of the Western leafcutting <b>bee</b> <b>are</b> clear, while their veins are black. The pollen basket below the abdomen is bright red.|$|R
50|$|Hesperocolletes douglasi, the Rottnest <b>bee,</b> <b>is</b> a now {{extinct species}} of {{plasterer}} <b>bee</b> that <b>was</b> endemic to Australia.|$|R
50|$|This {{endangered}} solitary <b>bee</b> <b>is</b> {{present in}} most of Europe and in the Near East. It is mainly found in Sweden but is threatened in several European countries. The overall population sizes of this <b>bee</b> <b>are</b> small.|$|R
5|$|Humans {{have kept}} honey bee colonies, {{commonly}} in hives, for millennia. Beekeepers collect honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly from hives; <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees {{for sale to}} other beekeepers.|$|E
5|$|Solitary <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} pollinators; {{they gather}} pollen to provision their nests with food for their brood. Often it {{is mixed with}} nectar to form a paste-like consistency. Some solitary bees have advanced types of pollen-carrying structures on their bodies. A very few species of solitary <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> being cultured for commercial pollination. Most of these species belong to a distinct set of genera which are commonly known by their nesting behavior or preferences, namely: carpenter bees, sweat bees, mason bees, polyester bees, squash bees, dwarf carpenter bees, leafcutter bees, alkali bees and digger bees.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bees</b> <b>are</b> {{themselves}} Müllerian mimics {{of other}} aposematic insects {{with the same}} colour scheme, including wasps, lycid and other beetles, and many butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) which are themselves distasteful, often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemicals from their plant food. All the Müllerian mimics, including bees, benefit from the reduced risk of predation that results from their easily recognised warning coloration.|$|E
50|$|This bumble <b>bee</b> <b>is</b> {{very common}} {{and has been}} {{experiencing}} steady growth unlike many other bumble <b>bees</b> that <b>are</b> in decline.|$|R
50|$|Sphecodes crassus, {{common name}} swollen-thighed blood <b>bee,</b> <b>is</b> {{a species of}} <b>bee.</b> It <b>was</b> {{described}} by Carl Gustaf Thomson in 1870.|$|R
50|$|Megachile pluto, {{also known}} as Wallace's giant <b>bee,</b> <b>is</b> a very large Indonesian resin <b>bee.</b> It <b>is</b> {{considered}} the largest living <b>bee</b> species. It <b>was</b> believed to be extinct until rediscovery in 1981.|$|R
5|$|Honey <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> not {{native to}} the Americas, {{therefore}} their necessity as pollinators in the U.S. and other regions in the Western Hemisphere is limited to strictly agricultural/ornamental uses, as no native plants require honey bee pollination, except where concentrated in monoculture situations—where the pollination need is so great at bloom time that pollinators must be concentrated beyond the capacity of native bees (with current technology).|$|E
5|$|In this way, {{the bucket}} orchid passes its pollen from flower to flower. This {{mechanism}} is almost {{but not quite}} species specific, as {{it is possible for}} a few closely related bees to pollinate any given species of orchid, as long as the <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> similar in size and are attracted by the same compounds.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> aposematically coloured, {{typically}} {{orange and}} black, warning {{of their ability}} to defend themselves with a powerful sting. As such they are models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects such as bee-flies, robber flies and hoverflies, all of which gain a measure of protection by superficially looking and behaving like bees.|$|E
50|$|Hylaeus alcyoneus, {{commonly}} known as the banksia <b>bee,</b> <b>is</b> a <b>bee</b> species endemic to Australia where it is commonly found in the coastal heaths of eastern and southern Western Australia. This <b>bee</b> <b>is</b> an important pollinator of Banksia species.|$|R
50|$|One {{study in}} {{particular}} gives a great illustration of this characteristic of X. virginica. In several experiments, males patrolling {{the entrance of}} a nest were confronted with either dead or living Eastern carpenter <b>bees.</b> The <b>bee</b> <b>was</b> suspended from a thread and dangled within the male's territory. Whether the <b>bee</b> <b>was</b> dead or alive, the male had no response when the <b>bee</b> <b>was</b> suspended and motionless. This is particularly interesting {{because we know that}} X. virginica are capable of recognizing other individuals of their species. However, when the suspended <b>bee</b> <b>was</b> released and allowed to fly in the male's territory or was swung through the territory on the thread, the territorial male pursued it.|$|R
25|$|The <b>bee</b> <b>is</b> still humming.|$|R
5|$|Most other bees, {{including}} familiar insects such as carpenter bees, leafcutter {{bees and}} mason <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> solitary {{in the sense}} that every female is fertile, and typically inhabits a nest she constructs herself. There is no division of labor so these nests lack queens and worker bees for these species. Solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor beeswax.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{state that}} colony collapse disorder is mainly {{a problem of}} feeding the bees a monoculture diet when they should receive food {{from a variety of}} sources/plants. In winter, these <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> given a single food source such as corn syrup (high-fructose or other), sugar and pollen substitute. In summer, they may only pollinate a single crop (e.g., almonds, cherries, or apples). The monoculture diet is attributed to bee rentals and migratory bee keeping. Honey <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> only being introduced to select commercial crops such as corn. These single pollen diets are greatly inferior to mixed pollen diets. However, there are a few pollens that are acceptable for honey bees to be introduced to exclusively, including sweet clover and mustard.|$|E
5|$|The painful stings of <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> mostly {{associated}} with the poison gland and the Dufour's gland which are abdominal exocrine glands containing various chemicals. In Lasioglossum leucozonium, the Dufour's Gland mostly contains octadecanolide {{as well as some}} eicosanolide. There is also evidence of n-triscosane, n-heptacosane, and 22-docosanolide. However, the secretions of these glands could also be used for nest construction.|$|E

50|$|Anji <b>Bee</b> <b>is</b> a vocalist/lyricist, podcaster, {{former college}} radio DJ, and music {{journalist}} from Los Angeles. <b>Bee</b> <b>is</b> {{best known as}} the vocalist and front person of the band, Lovespirals, and the hostess and producer of music show, The Chillcast with Anji Bee.|$|R
50|$|Andrena salicifloris, {{commonly}} known as the willow mining <b>bee,</b> <b>is</b> a <b>bee</b> in the genus Andrena. The bee ranges from Colorado to California and north to British Columbia, and often inhabits arid and alpine lands. The <b>bee</b> <b>is</b> often black or dark brown, and is sparsely coated with grayish hair on the thorax, legs and on the abdomen. The pollen basket is on most of the hind leg. The wings of the willow mining <b>bee</b> <b>are</b> smokey, and their veins are black.|$|R
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. <b>Bees</b> <b>are</b> able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E
5|$|However, some eusocial {{species such}} as {{termites}} are not haplodiploid. Conversely, all <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> haplodiploid but not all are eusocial, and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males, creating half-sisters that share only 25% of their genes. Haplodiploidy is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality. But, monogamy (queens mating singly) is the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated, so {{it is likely that}} haplodiploidy contributed to the evolution of eusociality in bees.|$|E
5|$|Some animals, notably insects such as {{the honey}} bee, are {{sensitive}} to the polarisation of light. Honey bees can use polarized light on overcast days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the compass direction they intend to travel. Karl von Frisch's work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the hive to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a waggle dance. The observing <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction, though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food. However, <b>bees</b> <b>are</b> certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely overcast (when polarised light may be used).|$|E

50|$|Osmia cornifrons, {{also known}} as the horned-face <b>bee,</b> <b>are</b> solitary <b>bees</b> {{indigenous}} to Northern Asia. Physically, this species of <b>bee</b> <b>is</b> recognized for its horn-like extensions originating from its lower face. Populations of O. cornifrons have been recorded in multiple locations, including Japan, Korea, China, and Russia. O. cornifrons are more docile as compared to other species of <b>bees</b> and <b>are</b> less prone to sting when aggravated.|$|R
50|$|The Salt Lake City <b>Bees</b> <b>were</b> a {{minor league}} {{baseball}} club, based in Salt Lake City, Utah from 1911 until 1984, under various names. The <b>Bees</b> <b>were</b> long-time members of both the Pacific Coast League and Pioneer League. The team played their home games at Derks Field.|$|R
