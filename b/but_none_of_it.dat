5|$|Plagued by hearing problems, the 64-year-old coach {{announced}} his retirement {{before the end of}} the 1970 season, which the Browns finished with a 7–7 record. Collier told Modell that he could no longer hear his players, and it was difficult to read their lips through new face masks that obscured their mouths. Modell tried to help by getting Collier to try new hearing aids and even sent him for acupuncture treatment, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> worked. Collier struggled during press conferences because he often could not hear what reporters were asking and answered the wrong questions. In eight years as coach, Collier led Cleveland to a championship and a 76–34–2 record. Nick Skorich, who came to the Browns as offensive coordinator in 1964, was named as his replacement in 1971.|$|E

500|$|By 1927, the routing of US 66 through Arizona {{had been}} laid out, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> had been paved yet. [...] By 1935, nearly the entire route had been paved, with the lone {{exceptions}} being a short stretch northeast of Valentine and a stretch between Peach Springs and Seligman. [...] By 1938, the entire route in Arizona had been paved. [...] In 1953, US 66 was realigned between the California border and Kingman to an alignment to the southeast to avoid the mountain curves and grades of the original alignment.

500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 75, based on 19 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Alex Macpherson of The Guardian complimented Usher's vocals, {{saying that they}} [...] "are in fine fettle", and found the album [...] "most interesting" [...] when it [...] "goes in directions that don't cleave to obvious aesthetics". AllMusic's Andy Kellman felt that, despite Usher's shift to dance music, [...] "he's more of a creative force when he's working with slower, soul-rooted material". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times described the album as not genre defying, but instead utilises the music styles of the [...] era– it's [...] "more pop than it is revolutionary". Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club said that [...] "not all of it works, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is unpleasant, either", and commended Usher for branching out and taking risks. Pitchfork Media's Carrie Battan felt that his strength [...] "lies in R, and he's adjusted well to shifting ground", although [...] "not everything on Looking 4 Myself hits the mark". At USA Today, Steve Jones stated that on the release Usher has [...] "chosen to keep growing and moving ahead" [...] on which he [...] "confidently steps out of his sonic comfort zone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the sessions, {{frontman}} Chris Cornell said, [...] "At {{the time}} Hiro [...] had excommunicated {{himself from the}} band and there wasn't a free-flowing system as far as music went, so I ended up writing a lot of it." [...] Cornell would end up solely writing seven out of the album's twelve tracks. Cornell stated that there [...] "was plenty of angst, anger, frustration and hell... <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> {{had anything to do}} with Terry. He was very supportive". He said that the sessions as a whole were a [...] "positive experience." [...] Bassist Hiro Yamamoto left the band once the sessions were over and went back to college, frustrated that he wasn't contributing much.|$|E

2500|$|In Venezuela, the Orinoco Belt {{oil sands}} range from [...] deep and no surface {{outcrops}} exist. The deposit is about [...] long east-to-west and [...] wide north-to-south, {{much less than}} the combined area covered by the Canadian deposits. In general, the Canadian deposits are found over a much wider area, have a broader range of properties, and have a broader range of reservoir types than the Venezuelan ones, but the geological structures and mechanisms involved are similar. The main differences is that the oil in the sands in Venezuela is less viscous than in Canada, allowing some of it to be produced by conventional drilling techniques, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> approaches the surface as in Canada, meaning none of it can be produced using surface mining. The Canadian deposits will almost all have to be produced by mining or using new non-conventional techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Sakuraba's {{match against}} Goes {{would be an}} {{instrumental}} point in his fighting's style evolution, pitted against an opponent with a strong defensive guard. Through the bout, Sakuraba attempted several moves to bypass the stationary Goes's defense, including leglocks, dives and kicks to the legs, but he also would have to defend, as Goes was relentless in his upkicks and submission counterattacks. Sakuraba was threatened by a rear naked choke several times, and in turn he almost finished Allan as well with an armbar, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> came to fruition. Due {{to the absence of}} judges in Pride's ruleset at the time, the match was ruled a draw. Goes, a Carlson Gracie apprentice, would state in a later interview [...] "I've been training my whole life on the ground, and to me [...] was the best guy I ever faced on the ground".|$|E
2500|$|Current-production burner {{categories}} are D1S, D1R, D2S, D2R, D3S, D3R, D4S, and D4R. The D stands for discharge, {{and the number}} is the type designator. The final letter describes the outer shield. The arc within an HID headlamp bulb generates considerable short-wave ultraviolet (UV) light, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> escapes the bulb, for a UV-absorbing hard glass shield is incorporated around the bulb's arc tube. This is important to prevent degradation of UV-sensitive components and materials in headlamps, such as polycarbonate lenses and reflector hardcoats.

I am persuaded that a great deal of what is called 'fraud' arises from the suggestibility of the psychics. Lombroso speaks of this 'fixed idea' of the mediums, and their persistent, almost insane, attempt to produce the phenomena desired by the circle. You can understand how this would be if there is anything at all in hypnotism. Sometimes it all seems to belong to the realm of hypnotic visions. One medium helps another to build up this unreal world. Early in my career as an investigator I went to Onset Bay, where in July of each year all the spiritualists and 'mejums' of New England used to gather (do yet, I believe), and I shall never forget the singular assemblage of 'slate-writers,' 'spirit artists,' 'spirit photographers,' 'palmists,' and 'psychometrists' whose signs lined the street and pointed along the paths of the camp.|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to describe the sensations with which Mark first landed. In approaching the place, both he and Bob had strained their eyes in the hope of seeing some proof that their shipmates had been there; but no discovery rewarded their search. Nothing was seen, on or about the island, to furnish the smallest evidence that either of the boats had touched it. Mark found that he was treading on naked rock when he had landed, though the surface was tolerably smooth. The rock itself was of a sort to which he was unaccustomed; and he began to suspect, what in truth turned out on further investigation to be the fact, that instead of being on a reef of coral, he was on one of purely volcanic origin. The utter nakedness of the rock both surprised and grieved him. On the reefs, in every direction, considerable quantities of sea-weed had lodged, temporarily at least; <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> appeared to have found its way to this particular place. Nakedness and dreariness were the two words which best described the island; the only interruption to its solitude and desolation being occasioned by the birds, which now came screaming and flying above the heads of the intruders, showing both by their boldness and their cries, that they were totally unacquainted with men.|$|E

60|$|Emerging {{from the}} by-road, and {{entering}} upon one that crossed it {{at right angles}} and led to Warwick, I espied the church of Dr. Parr. Like the others which I have described, it had a low stone tower, square, and battlemented at its summit: for all these little churches {{seem to have been}} built on the same model, and nearly at the same measurement, and have even a greater family-likeness than the cathedrals. As I approached, the bell of the tower (a remarkably deep-toned bell, considering how small it was) flung its voice abroad, and {{told me that it was}} noon. The church stands among its graves, a little removed from the wayside, quite apart from any collection of houses, and with no signs of vicarage; it is a good deal shadowed by trees, and not wholly destitute of ivy. The body of the edifice, unfortunately (and it is an outrage which the English church-wardens are fond of perpetrating), has been newly covered with a yellowish plaster or wash, so as quite to destroy the aspect of antiquity, except upon the tower, which wears the dark gray hue of many centuries. The chancel-window is painted with a representation of Christ upon the Cross, and all the other windows are full of painted or stained glass, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> ancient, nor (if it be fair to judge from without of what ought to be seen within) possessing any of the tender glory that should be the inheritance of this branch of Art, revived from mediaeval times. I stepped over the graves, and peeped in at two or three of the windows, and saw the snug interior of the church glimmering through the many-colored panes, like a show of commonplace objects under the fantastic influence of a dream: for the floor was covered with modern pews, very like what we may see in a New England meeting-house, though, I think, a little more favorable than those would be to the quiet slumbers of the Hatton farmers and their families. Those who slept under Dr. Parr's preaching now prolong their nap, I suppose, in the churchyard round about, and can scarcely have drawn much spiritual benefit from any truths that he contrived to tell them in their lifetime. It struck me as a rare example (even where examples are numerous) of a man utterly misplaced, that this enormous scholar, great in the classic tongues, and inevitably converting his own simplest vernacular into a learned language, should have been set up in this homely pulpit, and ordained to preach salvation to a rustic audience, to whom it is difficult to imagine how he could ever have spoken one available word.|$|E
