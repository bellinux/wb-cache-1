5|$|At the {{election}} party, Lana arrives with Chloe, but she once again leaves again when Lex calls. This time Lex kisses {{her when he}} learns of her break up, which causes Lana to leave. Like before, Lex pursues Lana, but this time Clark arrives in time to stop the bus. Jonathan goes to the farm after receiving a mysterious call during the party, and is greeted by Lionel Luthor (John Glover). Lionel insinuates he knows Clark's secret and shows a picture to Jonathan, which causes Jonathan to begin punching Lionel in anger. Jonathan dismisses Lionel and laboriously walks away, <b>breathing</b> <b>heavily.</b> Martha and Clark drive up and catch him as he has a heart attack, and, after taking a final look at his family, Jonathan dies {{in the arms of}} Martha and Clark. At Jonathan's funeral, all of Clark's close friends attend, as well as the Luthors. When the funeral is over, Clark picks up a handful of dirt and sprinkles it into his father's grave.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, <b>breathing</b> <b>heavily.</b> After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E
25|$|Birds may bite or stab {{with their}} beaks to defend themselves. Some species use their beaks in {{displays}} of various sorts. As {{part of his}} courtship, for example, the male garganey touches his beak to the blue speculum feathers on his wings in a fake preening display, and the male Mandarin duck does the same with his orange sail feathers. A number of species use a gaping, open beak in their fear and/or threat displays. Some augment the display by hissing or <b>breathing</b> <b>heavily,</b> while others clap their beaks.|$|E

25|$|Warrior died on April 8, 2014 in Scottsdale, Arizona. He {{had been}} {{inducted}} into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 5, appeared at WrestleMania XXX on April 6, and made his first Raw appearance in almost 18 years on April 7, the day before his death. According to reports, Warrior clutched his chest and collapsed at 5:50p.m. while walking to his car with his wife outside of their hotel in Arizona. He {{was rushed to the}} hospital where he was pronounced dead at age 54. Warrior's colleagues said Warrior appeared frail during WrestleMania weekend, and said that he was sweating profusely and <b>breathing</b> <b>heavily</b> backstage.|$|E
25|$|Although several {{theories}} of the ultimate cause of the singer's death persist to this day (including a few rather sinister ones), given what is now known about cardiovascular disease, {{it seems likely that}} by {{the time of his death}} Vysotsky had an advanced coronary condition brought about by years of tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse, as well as his grueling work schedule and the stress of the constant harassment by the government. Towards the end, most of Vysotsky's closest friends had become aware of the ominous signs and were convinced that his demise was only a matter of time. Clear evidence of this can be seen in a video ostensibly shot by the Japanese NHK channel only months before Vysotsky's death, where he appears visibly unwell, <b>breathing</b> <b>heavily</b> and slurring his speech. Accounts by Vysotsky's close friends and colleagues concerning his last hours were compiled in the book by V. Perevozchikov.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1954 Conacher was in Ottawa {{attending}} to his parliamentary duties {{when he was asked}} to play in the annual softball game between MPs and members of the parliamentary press gallery. On May 26, in the sixth inning, in his last at-bat-ever, he hit a long drive into left field, stretching a single into a triple, when he sprinted to third base. He stood, <b>breathing</b> <b>heavily</b> and then collapsed face-first from having been hit {{in the head with a}} pitch in an earlier inning. One of the other MPs was a doctor who tried to assist him, but there was little that could be done for Conacher and within twenty minutes he was pronounced dead. The next day Conacher was supposed to attend his daughter's graduation from the University of Toronto. A big funeral was held, and his brother Charlie flew in from England to be there. He was buried at St. Johns York Mills Anglican Church Cemetery in Toronto.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Peter announces to {{the family}} that he is fat and decides to create the [...] "National Association for The Advancement of Fat People" [...] (NAAFP). Peter hosts {{the first meeting of}} the association, but it is {{unsuccessful}} due to those attending were making too much noise, such as <b>breathing</b> <b>heavily,</b> farting, and munching junk food the entire way through.|$|E
500|$|It {{was during}} the 1913–14 hockey season, Baker's senior year, that his most famous game with Princeton took place. On January 24, they played Harvard at the Boston Arena. Initially the {{favorite}} to win, Princeton had a setback {{as one of its}} star players was injured and unable to play, and another was suspended. Baker was repeatedly called [...] offside, as he was too fast for the two replacement Princeton players (players were required to stay behind the puck-carrier at the time). In the [...] "sudden death" [...] overtime, after sixty minutes of play, Baker was not even <b>breathing</b> <b>heavily.</b> The game was the longest college hockey game played up to that point.|$|E
500|$|Rob Fitzpatrick of NME {{characterized}} Beyoncé's <b>breathing</b> <b>heavily</b> while {{grabbing the}} [...] "imaginary" [...] bedsheets but remained a [...] "devout young Christian woman singing {{what the public}} wants her to sing." [...] Describing [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] as an uptempo party track, Lisa Verrico of The Times commented that the song features [...] "an unusually high-pitched Beyoncé singing lines such as 'The rhythm's got me going crazy'". Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly found Beyoncé's singing [...] "not quite convincingly a naughty girl". This was echoed by Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times who said {{it was fun to}} hear Beyoncé mimicking [...] "the pizzicato line" [...] in [...] "Naughty Girl", and that it was not much fun to hear her try to sing [...] "like a naughty girl". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic commented that [...] "Storch does his most convincing imitation of the Neptunes writing their own Kashmir in a Middle Eastern restaurant".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} round Ali began {{to take control of}} the fight. At about 30 seconds into the round he hit Liston with several combinations, causing a bruise under Liston's right eye and a cut under his left, which {{eventually}} required eight stitches to close. It was the first time in his career that Liston had been cut. At one point in this attack, Liston's knees buckled and he almost went down as he was driven to the ropes. A clearly angered Liston rallied at the end of the round, as Ali seemed tired, and delivered punishing shots to Ali's body. It was probably Liston's best moment in the entire fight. [...] Sitting on his stool between rounds, Liston was <b>breathing</b> <b>heavily</b> as his cornermen worked on his cut.|$|E
2500|$|As {{each hour}} passed, there was growing {{concern for the}} whale's health, and {{she was said to}} be taking {{a turn for the worse}} due to being out of the water, as well as slowly being crushed by her own body weight. Plans to release the whale into the Atlantic ocean were shelved (the rescue team having {{previously}} put out a public appeal for a suitable boat); instead she was to be released off the Kent coast near Margate at Shivering Sands. All this time, the BDMLR were saying the final decision would be taken by a vet on board, who would decide whether to release or euthanize the whale. Later the mammal was described as being [...] "distressed", <b>breathing</b> <b>heavily</b> and developing muscle problems. At 7:08 pm on 21 January it was confirmed the whale had died after suffering from convulsions.|$|E
