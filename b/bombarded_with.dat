5|$|In 1934, an {{experiment}} showed that when natural 209Bi is <b>bombarded</b> <b>with</b> neutrons, 210Bi is created, which then decays to 210Po via beta-minus decay. The final purification is done pyrochemically followed by liquid-liquid extraction techniques. Polonium {{may now be}} made in milligram amounts in this procedure which uses high neutron fluxes found in nuclear reactors. Only about 100grams are produced each year, practically all of it in Russia, making polonium exceedingly rare.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to pin point any one reason as being the main cause or catalyst of the mutiny. However, a recent perspective has emerged {{of the role of}} global connections. The mutiny has revealed the permeable nature of colonial boundaries and the way that external influences were able to reach the colonies in Southeast Asia. The sepoys of the 5th Light Infantry were constantly being <b>bombarded</b> <b>with</b> information about what was happening outside of Singapore. As news of the fatwa issued by the Ottoman Sultan spread, an anti-British movement spearheaded by the Ghadar Party was also disseminating special pamphlets in a variety of languages which were reaching through secret channels {{into the hands of the}} sepoys. Acrimonious slogans against the British only fuelled the anti-colonial sentiment among the sepoys. Some of the slogans were “the wicked English and their allies are now attacking Islam, but the German Emperor and the Sultan of Turkey have sworn to liberate Asia from the tyranny. Now is the time to rise.... Only your strength and religious zeal are required”. The sepoys were clearly being <b>bombarded</b> <b>with</b> a lot of anti-British sentiments while being stationed on the small island of Singapore.|$|E

5|$|Two groups claimed {{discovery}} of the element. Evidence of element 106 was first reported in 1974 by a Russian research team in Dubna led by Yuri Oganessian, in which targets of lead-208 and lead-207 were <b>bombarded</b> <b>with</b> accelerated ions of chromium-54. In total, fifty-one spontaneous fission events were observed with a half-life between four and ten milliseconds. After having ruled out nucleon transfer reactions as a cause for these activities, the team concluded that the most likely cause of the activities was the spontaneous fission of isotopes of element 106. The isotope in question was first suggested to be seaborgium-259, but was later corrected to seaborgium-260.|$|E
5|$|Americium {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1944 {{by the group}} of Glenn T. Seaborg from Berkeley, California, at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago, {{a part of the}} Manhattan Project. Although it is the third element in the transuranic series, it was discovered fourth, after the heavier curium. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by uranium or plutonium being <b>bombarded</b> <b>with</b> neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors, as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the isotope 242mAm, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} disposal method, transmutation, {{has been}} demonstrated at CERN for technetium-99. In this process, the technetium (technetium-99 as a metal target) is <b>bombarded</b> <b>with</b> neutrons to form the short-lived technetium-100 (half-life = 16seconds) which decays by beta decay to ruthenium-100. If recovery of usable ruthenium is a goal, an extremely pure technetium target is needed; if small traces of the minor actinides such as americium and curium {{are present in the}} target, they are likely to undergo fission and form more fission products which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated target. The formation of ruthenium-106 (half-life 374days) from the 'fresh fission' is likely to increase the activity of the final ruthenium metal, which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used.|$|E

5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century it was clear that Gibraltar could be <b>bombarded</b> <b>with</b> {{relative}} impunity from the Spanish mainland. Proposals were put forward to build a new harbour {{on the east side of}} the Rock, where ships would be less vulnerable to direct artillery fire from the mainland, but were abandoned due to the vast expense and only marginal gains in security. A new round of tunnelling was carried out to provide more bombproof accommodation for the garrison, along with deep shelters and casemates capable of accommodating 2,000 men. Ultimately it was decided in 1906 that Gibraltar faced no credible threat from land and that the defences would be organised to deal with a threat from the sea.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Glenn T. Seaborg {{established}} that when thorium was <b>bombarded</b> <b>with</b> neutrons, {{it could be}} transformed into fissile uranium-233. This was another possible route to an atomic bomb, especially if {{it turned out that}} uranium-233 could be more easily separated from thorium than plutonium from uranium. It was not pursued further because uranium-233 production would have required a complete redesign of the Hanford reactors; but in April 1944 the Metallurgical Laboratory's Thorfin R. Rogness calculated that a nuclear reactor containing thorium could produce enough uranium-233 to sustain its reaction without adding anything but more thorium. This was very interesting, because {{at the time it was}} thought that uranium might be scarce, whereas thorium was at least ten times more plentiful.|$|E
5|$|Just {{over one}} gram of {{berkelium}} has been {{produced in the}} United States since 1967. There is no practical application of berkelium outside scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier transuranic elements and transactinides. A 22milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared during a 250-day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This sample was used to synthesize the new element tennessine {{for the first time}} in 2009 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Russia, after it was <b>bombarded</b> <b>with</b> calcium-48 ions for 150 days. This was the culmination of the Russia–US collaboration on the synthesis of the heaviest elements on the periodic table.|$|E

50|$|In {{the context}} of late medieval siege warfare the term superguns is {{sometimes}} applied to stone-firing <b>bombards</b> <b>with</b> a ball diameter of more than 50 cm. These superguns were either manufactured by forging together longitudinal iron bars, {{held in place by}} iron rings, or cast in bronze with techniques generally similar to bellfounding. Known examples include the Pumhart von Steyr, Dulle Griet and Mons Meg (all iron) as well as the cast-bronze Faule Mette, Faule Grete and Dardanelles Gun.|$|R
5|$|Males {{are known}} to be aggressive, with larger and older turtles being more dominant. Larger males rank higher on the social {{hierarchy}} often created by wood turtle colonies. In the wild, the submissive turtle is either forced to flee, or is <b>bombarded</b> <b>with</b> physical abuses, which include biting, shoving, and ramming. Larger and more dominant males will sometimes try to remove a subordinate male while he is mating with a female. The defender will, if he does not successfully fight for his position, lose the female to the larger male. Therefore, among males, there is a direct relationship between copulation opportunities and social rank. However, the outcome of encounters between two turtles is more aggression-dependent than size-dependent. The wood turtle that is more protective of his or her area is the victor. Physical bouts between wood turtles (regardless of gender) increases marginally during the fall and spring (times of mating).|$|E
5|$|The natural {{radioactivity}} of thorium and uranium {{made it hard}} to determine what was happening when these elements were <b>bombarded</b> <b>with</b> neutrons but, after correctly eliminating the presence of elements lighter than uranium but heavier than lead, Fermi concluded that they had created new elements, which he called hesperium and ausonium. The chemist Ida Noddack criticised this work, suggesting that some of the experiments could have produced lighter elements than lead rather than new, heavier elements. Her suggestion was not taken seriously at the time because her team had not carried out any experiments with uranium, and its claim to have discovered masurium (technetium) was disputed. At that time, fission was thought to be improbable if not impossible on theoretical grounds. While physicists expected elements with higher atomic numbers to form from neutron bombardment of lighter elements, nobody expected neutrons to have enough energy to split a heavier atom into two light element fragments in the manner that Noddack suggested.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{task of the}} metallurgists was {{to determine}} how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple allotropes of plutonium. The brittle α phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic β phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable δ phase that normally exists in the 300°C to 450°C range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when <b>bombarded</b> <b>with</b> alpha particles, which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a plutonium-gallium alloy, which stabilized the δ phase and could be hot pressed into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} {{methods for}} different isotopes vary, and only those for promethium-147 are given {{because it is}} the only isotope with industrial applications. Promethium-147 is produced in large quantities (compared to other isotopes) by <b>bombarding</b> uranium-235 <b>with</b> thermal neutrons. The output is relatively high, at 2.6% of the total product. Another way to produce promethium-147 is via neodymium-147, which decays to promethium-147 with a short half-life. Neodymium-147 can be obtained either by <b>bombarding</b> enriched neodymium-146 <b>with</b> thermal neutrons or by bombarding a uranium carbide target with energetic protons in a particle accelerator. Another method is to <b>bombard</b> uranium-238 <b>with</b> fast neutrons to cause fast fission, which, among multiple reaction products, creates promethium-147.|$|R

5|$|In Germany, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann bombarded uranium with neutrons, {{and noted}} that barium, a lighter element, was among the {{products}} produced. Hitherto, only the same or heavier elements had been produced by the process. In January 1939, Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch astounded the physics community with a paper that explained this result. They theorised that uranium atoms <b>bombarded</b> <b>with</b> neutrons can break into two roughly equal fragments, a process they called fission. They calculated that this {{would result in the}} release of about 200 MeV, implying an energy release orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions, and Frisch confirmed their theory experimentally. It was soon noted by Hahn that if neutrons were released during fission, then a chain reaction was possible. French scientists, Pierre Joliot, Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski, soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission. In a paper co-authored with the American physicist John Wheeler, Bohr theorised that fission was more likely to occur in the uranium-235 isotope, which made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly {{became a}} regular {{member of the}} Australian Test side in the 1932–33 season and he played in all five Tests against England in the infamous Bodyline series. The Australian {{selectors}} perceived that O'Reilly would be their key bowler, and as he had never played against the English, omitted him from the early tour matches so that the tourists {{would not be able}} to decode his variations. As a result, he missed the Australian XI match against the Englishmen in Melbourne. In two Shield matches ahead of the Tests, he took 14 wickets, including a total of 9/66 in an innings win over Queensland. Although the national selectors had hidden him from the Englishmen, New South Wales declined to do so, and he played for his state a week ahead of the Tests. The hosts were <b>bombarded</b> <b>with</b> short-pitched bowling and heavily beaten by an innings; O'Reilly took 4/86 as the visitors amassed 530, dismissing leading English batsman Wally Hammond in the first of many battles between the pair.|$|E
5|$|Two groups claimed {{discovery}} of the element. Evidence of bohrium was first reported in 1976 by a Russian research team led by Yuri Oganessian, in which targets of bismuth-209 and lead-208 were <b>bombarded</b> <b>with</b> accelerated nuclei of chromium-54 and manganese-55 respectively. Two activities, one with a half-life of one to two milliseconds, {{and the other with}} an approximately five-second half-life, were seen. Since the ratio of the intensities of these two activities was constant throughout the experiment, it was proposed that the first was from the isotope bohrium-261 and that the second was from its daughter dubnium-257. Later, the dubnium isotope was corrected to dubnium-258, which indeed has a five-second half-life (dubnium-257 has a one-second half-life); however, the half-life observed for its parent is much shorter than the half-lives later observed in the definitive {{discovery of}} bohrium at Darmstadt in 1981. The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) concluded that while dubnium-258 was probably seen in this experiment, the evidence for the production of its parent bohrium-262 was not convincing enough.|$|E
