500|$|Amanita australis {{produces}} small- to medium-sized fruit bodies, with <b>brown</b> <b>caps</b> up to [...] {{in diameter}} covered with pyramidal warts. The gills {{on the underside}} of the cap are white, closely crowded together, and free from attachment to the stem. The stem, which is up to [...] long and [...] thick, has a ring and a bulbous base. The mushroom may be confused with another endemic New Zealand species, A.nothofagi, but can be distinguished by differences in microscopic characteristics.|$|E
500|$|The cap of {{the fruit}} body is thin and membranous, {{measuring}} [...] in diameter. It has a convex shape slightly depressed in the center, conspicuous furrows in an outline of the gills, and scalloped edges. Young, unexpanded caps are yellowish brown; as the cap expands, the color lightens to whitish or light pinkish-white, often with a darker, sometimes brown center. The variety fusca has <b>brown</b> <b>caps.</b> [...] The white or slightly yellowish flesh is very thin, reaching about 0.25–1.5mm thick in {{the central part of}} the cap, and even thinner at the margin.|$|E

500|$|Leccinum manzanitae is an edible {{species of}} bolete fungus {{in the family}} Boletaceae. Described as new to science in 1971, it is {{commonly}} known as the manzanita bolete for its usual mycorrhizal association with manzanita trees. Its fruit bodies (mushrooms) have sticky reddish to <b>brown</b> <b>caps</b> up to , and its stipes are up to [...] long and [...] thick. They have a whitish background color punctuated with small black scales known as scabers. Found only in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada, it is the most common Leccinum species in California. The mushroom is edible, although opinions vary as to its quality. L.manzanitae can be usually distinguished from other similar bolete mushrooms by its large size, reddish cap, dark scabers on a whitish stipe, and association with manzanita and madrone.|$|E
500|$|Amanita nothofagi is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Amanitaceae. Endemic to New Zealand, the species was first {{described}} by mycologist Greta Stevenson in 1962. The fruit bodies have dark <b>brown</b> <b>caps</b> that are up to [...] in diameter and covered with patches of soft greyish-brown scales or warts. The gills underneath the cap are crowded together, free from attachment to the stem, and white, becoming tinged with yellow in age. The stem of the mushroom is [...] long by [...] thick, and has a ring. The spore print is white, and individual spores are spherical to ellipsoid, measuring 7.5–9 by 7.5–9 micrometres. The mushroom may be confused with another New Zealand species, A.australis, but can be distinguished by certain characteristics. Amanita nothofagi is a mycorrhizal species, and grows in association with native New Zealand trees such as Southern Beech.|$|E
500|$|Suillellus amygdalinus (formerly Boletus amygdalinus) is {{a fungus}} of the bolete family found in western North America. [...] The fruit bodies, or mushrooms, are {{characterized}} by their thick, red to <b>brown</b> <b>caps,</b> red pores, and the strong bluing reaction observed when the mushroom tissue is injured or cut. The cap can reach diameters of up to [...] and the stipe [...] long by [...] thick at maturity. This mushroom {{has been found in}} manzanita and madrone woodlands of central California north to southern Oregon. Although the edibility of the mushroom is not known with certainty, it may be poisonous, and is not recommended for consumption. Other similar red-pored, bluing boletes from North America, including Rubroboletus eastwoodiae, Boletus luridiformis, and B.subvelutipes, can be distinguished from S.amygdalinus either by the color of the cap, the degree of reticulation (a network of raised ridges) on the stipe, or by location.|$|E
50|$|The {{mushroom}} {{is often}} {{confused with the}} similar Aureoboletus auriporus, which has a pinkish cinnamon to dark reddish <b>brown</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In {{common with}} all other counties, Surrey's one-day sides have worn a variety of {{different}} coloured kits over the years. Currently, they wear predominantly black shirts with 'fluro blue' decoration. This replaced the 40-over black shirts with 'fluro green' piping and white patches and the 20-over 'fluro green' and black designs of 2010 and 2011. The limited overs teams were called Surrey Lions before a name change for the 2006 season to Surrey <b>Brown</b> <b>Caps,</b> but another switch saw them revert to Surrey Lions. In 2012 they dropped the [...] "Lions" [...] and were called simply Surrey. The side wore navy blue and sky blue in 2004 in both forms of the limited overs game and stuck with these colours in 2005. 2007 saw the light blue replaced by Surrey's traditional brown in the 40-over game, before the darker shade of blue turned to gold in 2008 to produce a gold and brown combination, while silver and brown were preferred for Twenty20 contests. White, red and sky blue were worn by the side featuring Mark Butcher and Adam Hollioake around the start of the 21st century.|$|E

They don't go in for bright colors any more than we Wrens do. They show good taste. I like the little <b>brown</b> <b>caps</b> they wear, and the way their breasts and sides are streaked with brown. Then, too, they are such useful folks. It is a pity that that nuisance of a Bully doesn't learn something from them. I suppose they stay rather later than we do in the fall." ...|$|E
50|$|Sexes are similar, {{but young}} birds have a <b>brown</b> <b>cap</b> and a pale yellow bill. There are 14 subspecies, varying {{in size and}} the colour of the back, underparts and eyestripe.|$|R
50|$|The 13 cm long Songar tit has a dark <b>brown</b> <b>cap,</b> blackish bib, rich brown upperparts, white {{cheeks and}} {{cinnamon}} buff underparts. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are somewhat duller.|$|R
50|$|The female is similar, but {{the top of}} {{the head}} is greyer and the crown patch is smaller or absent. Young birds have a <b>browner</b> <b>cap,</b> a {{brownish}} tint to the upperparts and broader, yellower wing bars.|$|R
5000|$|Caladenia ustulata, {{commonly}} known as <b>brown</b> <b>caps,</b> is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. It was first formally described in 2007 by David Jones who gave it the name Stegostyla ustulata and published the description in The Orchadian. In 2010 Gary Backhouse changed the name to Caladenia ustulata and published the change in The Victorian Naturalist. The specific epithet (ustulata) is a Latin word meaning [...] "scorched", [...] "singed" [...] or [...] "browned". <b>Brown</b> <b>caps</b> occurs in the southern tablelands and south-west slopes, which includes the Australian Capital Territory.|$|E

50|$|Armillaria umbrinobrunnea is {{a species}} of {{mushroom}} in the Physalacriaceae family. This species is found in South America. The beige to light <b>brown</b> <b>caps</b> of the mushroom are between 15 and 50 mm in diameter, and densely covered in small scales.

50|$|Boletus pinetorum is an edible bolete fungus {{found in}} Fennoscandia. It was {{described}} as a new species in 2009 from a collection made in Finland. It resembles the popular Boletus edulis but is distinct from that species genetically. Fruitbodies of B. pinetorum have greyish <b>brown</b> <b>caps</b> with wrinkled margins. The bolete is mycorrhizal with pines, and grows in dry sandy pine heaths and dry coniferous forests.|$|E
50|$|The butter boletes have red or <b>brown</b> <b>caps,</b> yellow pores and stipes {{that turn}} blue when cut or bruised in many species, and olive-brown {{spindle-shaped}} spores. Their flesh is usually mild tasting.

5|$|The related Turbinellus kauffmanii, {{found in}} western North America, is similar-looking {{but has a}} pale <b>brown</b> <b>cap.</b> Younger {{specimens}} of the latter species also have a pungent smell. Turbinellus fujisanensis, found in Japan, is another lookalike that has smaller spores than T.floccosus.|$|R
500|$|Especially {{characteristic}} for S.collinitus are the cap striations {{and pink}} mycelium. The fungus in many aspects resembles S. granulatus – a common species in European pine forests. S.granulatus, however, has a [...] <b>brown</b> <b>cap</b> without striations, and its mycelium is characteristically white.|$|R

5000|$|Based on a folktale, {{the story}} follows {{the life of}} a mustachioed cap {{salesman}} who wears his entire stock of caps on his head; they consist of his own checked cap, then a bunch of grey caps, a bunch of <b>brown</b> <b>caps,</b> a bunch of blue caps and finally a bunch of red caps on the very top.
