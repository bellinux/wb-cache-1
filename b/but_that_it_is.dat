Chris Smith writes in Boy Genius Report that {{just this one}} version of Android is affected <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a popular version of Android (Chitika claim 4.1.1 is on 50 million devices; Google describe it as less than 10% of activated Android devices). Other Android versions are not vulnerable as they either have heartbeats disabled or use an unaffected version of OpenSSL.|$|E
5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not a distinct substance.|$|E
5|$|In vertebrates, alpha-latrotoxin {{produces}} {{its effect}} through destabilisation of cell membranes and degranulation of nerve terminals, resulting in excessive release of neurotransmitters, namely acetylcholine, norepinephrine and GABA. Excess neurotransmitter activity leads to clinical manifestations of envenomation, although the precise mechanisms {{are not well}} understood. Acetylcholine release accounts for neuromuscular manifestations, and norepinephrine release accounts for the cardiovascular manifestations. Female redbacks have an average of around 0.08–0.10mg of venom, and experiments indicate that the median lethal dose (LD50) for mice at room temperature is 10–20% of this quantity (0.27–0.91mg/kg based on {{the mass of the}} mice used), <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> considerably more deadly for mice kept at lower or higher temperatures. Pure alpha-latrotoxin has an LD50 in mice of 20–40µg/kg.|$|E

25|$|More rabbinically {{traditional}} Reform and Reconstructionist Jews {{believe that}} these halakhoth in general may be valid, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> up to each individual to decide {{how and when to}} apply them.

25|$|Transhumanist {{philosophers}} {{argue that}} there not only exists a perfectionist ethical imperative for humans to strive for progress and improvement of the human condition, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible and desirable for humanity to enter a transhuman phase of existence in which humans enhance themselves beyond what is naturally human. In such a phase, natural evolution would be replaced with deliberate participatory or directed evolution.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{he issued}} his {{translation}} of Dante's Divine Comedy. The work, adopting quatrains {{to translate the}} original's terza rima, was well received by Australian critics. Writing for The New York Times, Joseph Luzzi thought it often fails to capture the more dramatic moments of the Inferno, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> more successful where Dante slows down, in the more theological and deliberative cantos of the Purgatorio and Paradiso.|$|E

25|$|Results of the {{experiment}} showed performance of {{the experiment}}al condition to be slightly less accurate than the no-overlap condition. Irwin attributed this decrease in accuracy to the extra neural processes involved in performing an eye movement, combined with processing the dot pattern. He concluded from this that transsaccadic memory does exist, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> very similar if not identical to short term visual memory and less similar to sensory memory.|$|E
25|$|Swedenborg {{proposed}} many scientific ideas {{during his}} lifetime. In his youth, {{he wanted to}} present a new idea every day, as {{he wrote to his}} brother-in-law Erik Benzelius in 1718. Around 1730, he had changed his mind, and instead believed that higher knowledge is not something that can be acquired, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> based on intuition. After 1745, he instead considered himself receiving scientific knowledge in a spontaneous manner from angels.|$|E
25|$|Here, Ellis touches {{upon the}} often {{paradoxical}} nature of widely reported consensual S practices. It {{is described as}} not simply pain to initiate pleasure, but violence—"or the simulation of involuntary violent acts"—said to express love. This irony is highly evident in the observation by many, that not only are popularly practiced sadomasochistic activities usually performed at the express request of the masochist, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> often the designated masochist who may direct such activities, through subtle emotional cues perceived or mutually understood and consensually recognized by the designated sadist.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes of}} this {{violence}} against Muslims are varied. The roots {{are thought to}} lie in India's history– resentment toward the Islamic domination of India during the Middle Ages, policies established by the country's British colonizers, and the violent partition of India into a Muslim-majority Pakistan and a secular India with a Muslim minority. Many scholars believe that incidents of anti-Muslim violence are politically motivated {{and a part of}} the electoral strategy of mainstream political parties who are associated with Hindu nationalism like the Bharatiya Janata Party. Other scholars believe that the violence is not widespread <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> restricted to certain urban areas because of local socio-political conditions.|$|E
25|$|Dualism and monism are the {{two major}} schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem. Dualism is the {{position}} that mind and body are in some way separate from each other. It {{can be traced back}} to Plato, Aristotle and the Nyaya, Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, but it was most precisely formulated by René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas Property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not a distinct substance.|$|E
25|$|According to Dorin Chirtoacă, Mayor of Chișinău, {{pressure}} from society must exist, but organizers of protests should correctly calculate their forces and actions. He {{also stated that}} eventual early elections would further destabilize the situation in Moldova. A similar position was adopted by Moldova's parliament speaker, Andrian Candu, saying {{such a move would}} leave the country stuck in economic crisis. During the September protests, Dorin Chirtoacă has called for the tents to be removed from the central boulevard and claimed that not only is the protest illegal, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> being fomented by Moscow. He has claimed that Renato Usatîi and Igor Dodon are puppets of Vladimir Putin.|$|E

25|$|National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the British Association for Psychopharmacology, and the World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry {{suggest that}} there is little {{difference}} in effectiveness between antipsychotics in prevention of relapse, and recommend that the specific choice of antipsychotic be chosen based on persons preference and side effect profile. The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concludes that olanzapine is not different from haloperidol in the treatment of positive symptoms and general psychopathology, or in overall assessment, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> superior for the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms. When trials enrolling only treatment-resistant patients were excluded from the analysis, olanzapine was superior for overall assessment.|$|E
25|$|HK commercially markets the MK 23 and {{derivatives}} of it, but not {{the complete}} SOCOM system. The suppressor is made by Knight's Armament Company, and was selected over the one HK originally included {{as part of its}} entry. Insight Technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module, later designated AN/PEQ-6. One version of the LAM produces a visible light dot, while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles. There have since been different LAM models and, at least commercially, different suppressors as well. It has been reported by some users that the cumulative effects of recoil may occasionally cause the can of the suppressor to become slightly unscrewed, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem.|$|E
25|$|Lusitanian is an Indo-European {{language}} but it {{was quite}} different from the Celtiberian languages of the Iberian Peninsula. It is not considered a Celtic language under existing definitions of linguistic Celticity. The Lusitanian inscriptions retain Indo-European p in positions where Celtic languages would not, most unambiguously in PORCOM 'pig' in one inscription, PORGOM in another, a feature considered non-Celtic. Prósper, in her Lusitanian etymologies (2002; 2008), demonstrates that not only does Lusitanian not agree closely with the usual Celtic reflexes <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> closer to Italic, in which case there were two well-differentiated branches of Indo-European in the Iberian Peninsula before the Romans, with Lusitanian belonging to the non-Celtic branch. Villar and Pedrero (2001) connect Lusitanian with the Italic languages. They base their finding on parallels in the names of deities and some lexical items (e.g. similarity of Umbrian gomia and Lusitanian comaiam), and some grammatical elements. Prósper also sees Lusitanian as predating the introduction of Celtic and shows that it retains elements of Old European, making its origins possibly even older.|$|E
