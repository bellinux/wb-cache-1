25|$|Continuing their {{participation}} of AVTC's, CSULA {{is involved with}} General Motors' new competition series called EcoCAR3. This competition is a 4-year competition where 16 Universities across northern America were donated a 2016 Chevy Camaro and are focused on converting this traditional fossil fuel vehicle into a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. CSULA's team has focused on developing a post transmission parallel architecture for their vehicle. Additionally, the team has decided to deviate from the standard expectation of marketing their developed vehicle to consumers and is instead targeting Law Enforcement Fleets as a <b>business</b> <b>to</b> <b>business</b> focus. The EcoCar3 team will have four years (2014–18) to redesign and re-engineer a Chevy Camaro {{in an effort to}} reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse emissions of the vehicle, while maintaining consumer acceptability, performance, utility and safety. At the end of the four year, the student-build vehicles will participate in an over-the-road event, raising the stakes for vehicle, dependability and safety.
