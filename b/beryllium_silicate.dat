40|$|The {{fluorescent}} colors at {{room temperature}} of various completely-reacted manganese-activated zinc <b>beryllium</b> <b>silicate</b> phosphors can be changed by reheating them to tem-peratures lower than the original firing temperature with subsequent cooling at a rate in effect similar to the original cooling rate. A radical change in the cooling rate, as by quenching in water, also produces color shifts apart from the change due to reheating alone. When a zinc <b>beryllium</b> <b>silicate</b> (Mn) phosphor is reheated at various temperatures from 700 ~ to 1200 ~ with subsequent ormal cooling, shifts to the green occur in all cases with a maximum shift at 950 ~ With increased time of retiring, especially at the higher temperatures, the colors shift back toward the original phosphor color. With reheating and subsequent water quenching, the color shift to the green increases almost linearly with temperature over the range 800 ~ to 1200 ~ and extrapolates to zero color shift at 700 ~ The magnitude of the color shift is greater with quenching than with normal cooling. The data require two equilibrium approach rates for interpretation. The first or rapid change involves the equilibrium of manganese between its red-emitting and green-emitting states, with the green-emitting structure predominating athigh temperatures. The second or slow change involves the migration of beryllium between substitutional positions either for silicon or zinc in the crystal. The equilibrium favors the beryllium-for-zinc substitution more for higher temperatures. The beryllium position in turn modifies the manganese-state distribution, and this third equilibrium between the primary equilibria ccounts for the time dependence of the color shifts...|$|E

40|$|The mineral meliphanite (Ca,Na) 2 Be[(Si,Al) 2 O 6 (F,OH) ] is a {{crystalline}} sodium calcium <b>beryllium</b> <b>silicate</b> {{which has}} the potential to be used as piezoelectric material and for other ferroelectric applications. The mineral has been characterized by a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and vibrational spectroscopy. EDS analysis shows a material with high concentrations of Si and Ca and low amounts of Na, Al and F. Beryllium was not detected. Raman bands at 1016 and 1050 cm 1 are assigned to the SiO and AlOH stretching vibrations of three dimensional siloxane units. The infrared spectrum of meliphanite is very broad in comparison with the Raman spectrum. Raman bands at 472 and 510 cm 1 are assigned to OSiO bending modes. Raman spectroscopy identifies bands in the OH stretching region. Raman spectroscopy with complimentary infrared spectroscopy enables the characterization of the silicate mineral meliphanite...|$|E
40|$|The insufficiently studied <b>beryllium</b> <b>silicate</b> sphaerobertrandite {{has been}} known since 1957. The present work {{presents}} new findings, verifies that the mineral is a valid species with a unique structure. The original name sphaerobertrandite has been kept {{in spite of its}} unjustifiable connection to bertrandite. The mineral is named after the typical spherulitic morphology of its aggregates, and its similarity to bertrandite in the main chemical constituents. Sphaerobertrandite was recently found in alkaline pegmatites at Sengischorr Mountain, Lovozero massif, Kola peninsula, Russia, inside epididymite segregations, coexisting with eudidymite, aegirine, mangan-neptunite, etc., and in Tuften quarry, Tvedalen, South Norway, coexisting with hambergite, analcime, chiavennite, etc. The mineral forms spherulites up to 2 mm, as well as fibrous crusts. Sphaerobertrandite from Sengischorr Mountain occurs as thin tabular, prismatic crystals up to 0. 5 × 0. 2 × 0. 05 mm inaggregates overgrowing epididymite. The main crystal form is { 001 }, small faces { 012 }, { 102 } and { 10 - 2 } are present. Transparent to translucent; colourless, white, yellow, brownish, greyish, beige. Streak white. Lustre vitreous. Mohs' hardness 5. Brittle. Cleavage perfect on (001). D (meas.) is 2. 46 - 2. 54, D (calc.) is 2. 52 g/cm 3. Biaxial, negative, alpha = 1. 597 (3), beta = 1. 607 (4), gamma = 1. 616 (3), 2 V (meas) is 70 (± 20) ° Orientationn: Z = c. IR spectrum is unique; frequencies of absorption bands are (cm- 1; sh - shoulder, w - weak; the most intensive bands are underlined) : 3605, 3540, 3505, 3370 sh, 3250 sh, 3060 w, 1620 sh, 1400 sh, 1150, 1115, 1090 sh, 995 sh, 933, 900, 835, 768, 721, 680 sh, 639, 612, 573 w, 555 w, 491, 424, 410 sh. Chemical composition of the sample from Sengischorr Mountain is: BeO 45. 88, SiO 2 38. 46, H 2 O+ 12. 54, total 96. 88 wt. %, corresponding to Be 2. 97 Si 1. 03 O 4. 06 (OH) 1. 94 • 0. 155 H 2 O. Monoclinic, P 2 llc, with a = 5. 081 (3), b = 4. 639 (1), c = 17. 664 (9) Å, beta = 106. 09 (5) °, V = 400. 0 Å 3, with a strongly pseudo-orthorhombic cell, which is the likely reason for the samples being invariably twinned by pseudo-merohedry. The strongest lines in the X-ray powder pattern are (d in Å -I[hkl]) : 4. 885 - 90 [100]; 4. 236 - 62 [004]; 3. 161 - 100 [111, 11 - 3]; 2. 836 - 70 [104]; 2. 538 - 55 [20 - 2]; 2. 318 - 90 [020]; 2. 174 - 55 [10 - 8]. The crystal structure has been refined to R = 0. 090. Better refinement could not be achieved because of twinning by pseudo-merohedry with low obliquity, which produces partial overlapping of reflections. The structure consists of mixed framework formed by Be- and Si-tetrahedra which comprises 6 - and 4 - membered rings. All vertices of SiO 4 tetrahedra are shared with 2 BeO 4 tetrahedra. The OH anions are shared only between two Be tetrahedra. The structure contains Be(3) O 3 chains screwed around 2 axis and reinforced by SiO 4 tetrahedra. These (Be,Si,O) chains are linked by the dimers Be(2) 2 O 6 and by Be(1) O 4 tetrahedra...|$|E
