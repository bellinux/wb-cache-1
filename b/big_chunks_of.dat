Captain Miller sent two men ahead in a boat to scout out for rocks and rapids, and the Shoshone proceeded behind them.

[...] The Bullfrog Mining District, the Bullfrog Hills, the town of Bullfrog, and other geographical entities in the region took their name from the Bullfrog Mine. [...] "Bullfrog" [...] became so popular that Giant Bullfrog, Bullfrog Merger, Bullfrog Apex, Bullfrog Annex, Bullfrog Gold Dollar, Bullfrog Mogul, and most of the district's other 200 or so mining companies included [...] "Bullfrog" [...] in their names. [...] The name persisted and, decades later, was given to the short-lived Bullfrog County.|$|E

50|$|If a {{large part}} of the cooking time is spent at {{temperatures}} lower than 60 °C (as when the contents of the cooker are slowly cooling over a long period), a danger of food poisoning due to bacterial infection, or toxins produced by multiplying bacteria, arises. It is essential to heat food sufficiently at the outset of vacuum cooking; 60 °C throughout the dish for 10 minutes is sufficient to kill most pathogens of interest, effectively pasteurizing the dish. Some foods, such as kidney beans, fava beans, and many other varieties of beans contain a toxin, phytohaemagglutinin, that requires boiling at 100 °C for at least 10 minutes to break down to safe levels. The best practice is to bring briefly to a rolling boil then put the pot in the flask. This keeps it hottest longest. With <b>big</b> <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> food, boil a little longer before putting into the flask.|$|E

The powder is prepared with olive oil and some tomato paste into a sauce, not soup, and <b>big</b> <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> chuck beef are often added halfway through cooking. The dark green sauce simmers on low heat and is left to thicken to the consistency of tomato sauce. The sauce is served in small deep plates with a piece of beef and eaten with preferably white hardy French or Italian bread. In certain regions where beef is not common, lamb is used but cooks for a much shorter time.|$|E
