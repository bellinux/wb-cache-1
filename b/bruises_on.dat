5|$|Apart from Greece itself, {{medicinal}} plants are produced in Italy in Tyrrhenia, as Aeschylus records, and Latium; and in Egypt, which as Homer mentions {{is the source}} of the drug nepenthes that makes men forget sorrow and passion. The best hemlock comes from Susa, while dittany, useful in childbirth, comes only from Crete. Wolfsbane comes from Crete and Zakynthos; it can be made into a poison that causes death a year or more after taking it, and there is no antidote. Hemlock is a poison which brings a painless death; pepper and frankincense are antidotes for it. Strykhnos causes madness, but oleander root in wine makes people gentle and cheerful. Birthwort has many uses including for <b>bruises</b> <b>on</b> the head, snakebite, and prolapse of the uterus.|$|E
5|$|The 14-day {{trial of}} Took began on 11 July 2005 before Justice Lai Kew Chai in the High Court. The {{prosecution}} relied on 76 witnesses, a video in which Took re-enacted the murder, forensic evidence and an autopsy that found several <b>bruises</b> <b>on</b> Huang Na's head. Based on the evidence, the prosecution alleged that Took lured Huang Na to the storeroom, then stripped and sexually assaulted her. After smothering and stomping {{on her to}} ensure her death, he stored her body in nine layers of plastic bags stuffed into a sealed cardboard box. The defence relied on the claim of diminished responsibility. Psychiatrist R. Nagulendran argued that Took was schizophrenic, as some of his behaviour, such as frequently smiling to himself and talking of spirits, was inappropriate {{and he had no}} motive for the murder – Nagulendran also called Took's story about the three Chinese men a delusion.|$|E

5|$|The Mumbai Police {{announced}} its move to put Raj under their custody on 13 February, which created an upsurge {{of violence in}} the state and led to two deaths. Attacks on North Indians were reported from Mumbai, Pune, Jalna, Beed, Aurangabad and Latur. Shops, offices and other business establishments were shut down in different parts of Mumbai, as MNS workers threatened violence in case their leader was arrested. Central Mumbai localities were most affected, especially around Dadar and Shivaji Park, the strongholds of both the MNS and the Shiv Sena. The police blocked roads in front of the residence of Raj in the Shivaji Park area. A civic activist named James John was assaulted by suspected MNS workers while he was attempting to photograph them forcing shop owners to down shutters in JB Nagar, Andheri. John suffered two rib fractures and <b>bruises</b> <b>on</b> his lungs. In Nashik, an employee of the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, a Maharashtrian, died during a stone pelting on state-run buses by MNS supporters. A migrant from Bihar, who was a security guard with a private company at Igatpuri in Nashik district, was killed by a mob.|$|E

25|$|A {{majority}} of Black hairstyles involve parting the natural hair into individual sections before styling. Research shows that excessive braiding, tight cornrows, relaxing, and vigorous dry-combing of afro-textured hair can {{be harmful to}} the hair and scalp. They have also been known to cause ailments such as alopecia, balding {{at the edges of}} the scalp, excessive dry scalp, and <b>bruises</b> <b>on</b> the scalp. Keeping hair moisturized, trimming ends, and using very little to no heat will prevent breakage and split ends.|$|E

25|$|Pathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's {{forensic}} science institute, performed the autopsy on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises {{and a couple}} of insubstantial cuts on the palm of her hand. <b>Bruises</b> <b>on</b> her nose, nostrils, mouth, and underneath her jaw were compatible with a hand being clamped over her mouth and nose. Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's {{forensic science}} institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.|$|E

Connelly was arrested again in May 2007.|$|E
25|$|Six {{forensic}} experts {{hired by}} Mrs. Duggan examined Shove's autopsy report and photographs taken by accident investigators in Wiesbaden. A forensic pathologist suggested that <b>bruises</b> <b>on</b> Duggan's {{hands and arms}} were defensive injuries. Paul Canning, a forensic photographer formerly with the Metropolitan police, and Alan Bayle, a forensic scientist, suggested that Duggan may have died elsewhere and been placed at the scene. Bayle argued that the Peugeot windscreen had been hit with a crowbar or similar, while Canning wrote that he found nothing {{to suggest that the}} cars had made contact with Duggan. Two other forensic experts expressed similar views.|$|E

25|$|In August 2004, Leykis was {{attacked}} outside a Seattle bar and all-night diner, The 5 Point Cafe. In the assault, he was {{kicked in the}} face and knocked down to the ground, causing him to require 17 stitches over one eye, and leaving him with scratches and <b>bruises</b> <b>on</b> his knees. The assailant reportedly had an accomplice who accused Leykis of calling him a name and hanging up on him when he called the show. The suspects left by taxi prior to police arriving on the scene and were jailed. Leykis refused to prosecute due to the distance and he felt that having a few days in jail was enough.|$|E
25|$|Butler was {{represented}} by Patrick McGuinness and Ann Finnell, two attorneys from the Public defenders office. They supplied a photograph of Butler with <b>bruises</b> <b>on</b> his face, which they claimed {{was the result of}} the interrogation. The jury deliberated for less than an hour before finding Butler not guilty; one juror later cited the testimony about the interrogation as one of the key factors in their decision. State Attorney Shorstein and Jacksonville Sheriff Glover took the unusual steps of apologizing to Butler and re-opening the case of two unrelated suspects. However, Michael Glover denied the allegations against him, and Shorstein said there was no evidence that Butler had been physically abused during the interrogation.|$|E
25|$|Despite all the censorship, the Government allowed Al-Wasat to keep operating, only {{suspending}} {{the newspaper}} for one day, on 3 April 2011. However, this permission came with heavy {{costs to the}} newspaper's editors and journalists. After the suspension on 3 April the editor-in-chief, among other editors, {{was forced to resign}} and Karim Fakhrami, {{one of the founders of}} Al-Wasat, was arrested on the same day and died in custody on 12 April. The public announcement said that his death was due to kidney failure. However, the Committee to Protect Journalists said that there were <b>bruises</b> <b>on</b> his body and the final report of the Commission of Inquiry classified Fakhrami's death as due to torture.|$|E

A Bible was left by Nancy's body, and she died of asphyxiation. She had <b>bruises</b> <b>on</b> her back and stomach consistent with an attacker pressing a knee into her back while pulling on a cord around her neck. Daniel also died of asphyxiation, without signs of restraint. He had internal injuries to the throat area, but no bruises, indicating he may have been killed by a choke. Chris killed Nancy on Friday, Daniel on Saturday, then asphyxiated himself with the cord of a weight machine in his basement early Sunday morning.|$|E
25|$|On 7 March 2012, a {{forensic}} pathologist, Dr Nathaniel Cary {{told the jury}} that David Gilroy had curved scratches on his hands a cut on his forehead, <b>bruises</b> <b>on</b> his chest and other scratches to his hands, wrist and forearms on 6 May 2010. A series of photographs were produced in court (left). He told the advocate depute that the scratches could {{have been caused by}} another person's fingernails, possibly in a struggle, and that this had happened around the time Ms Pilley went missing. He also said that the injuries were consistent with what he had seen previously in cases involving strangulation, but that it was difficult to tell because the injuries had been covered with a make-up like substance. Under cross-examination Dr Cary confirmed that the scratches on Gilroy's hands could have come from gardening activities.|$|E
25|$|In July and August 2012, {{protests in}} the Qatif region {{intensified}} after Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr {{was wounded in}} the leg and arrested by police on 8 July. Three men were killed in a protest on the evening of the arrest. Funerals and protests took place on 10 July, 11 July and 13 July, including chants calling for the downfall of the House of Saud.
