40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{implementation}} of a multi-robot cooperation framework to collectively execute inter-dependent tasks of an overall complex mission requiring diverse capabilities. Given a heterogeneous team of robots and task dependencies, the proposed framework provides a distributed mechanism for assigning tasks to robots in an order that efficiently completes the mission. The approach is robust to unreliable communication and robot failures. It is a distributed auction-based approach, and therefore scalable. In order to obtain optimal allocations, effective <b>bid</b> <b>evaluations</b> are needed. Additionally to maintain optimality in noisy environments, dynamic re-allocations of tasks are needed as implemented in dynamic task selection and coalition maintenance scheme that we propose. Real-time contingencies are handled by recovery routines, called Plan B precautions in our framework. Here, in this paper, we present performance results of our framework for robustness in simulations that include variable message loss rates and robot failures. Experiments illustrate robustness of our approach against several contingencies. ...|$|R

However, most projects are not like that. There is a trend towards increased complexity, uncertainty, and time pressure in projects, which has rendered traditional procurement procedures obsolete. Chen and Manley emphasized that projects focused on collaborative schemes, {{in which it is}} expected that relationships between project participants will be encouraged, can potentially maximize project outcomes. Cooperative procurement procedures entail among other things, joint specification, selected tendering, soft parameters in <b>bid</b> <b>evaluation,</b> joint subcontractor selection, incentive-based payment, collaborative tools, and contractor self-control. Collaborative approaches to project delivery are believed to be especially appropriate for projects of high complexity and uncertainty. Cardenas, Voordijk, and Dewulf have recently shown that some elements of the collaborative approach to procurement and delivery are beneficial in complex projects. The data on which this finding is originated consist of records on 58 European infrastructure projects.

40|$|Combinatorial auctions {{have become}} popular for shippers to secure {{transportation}} services. It is, however, {{very difficult for}} truck carriers to solve <b>bid</b> generation and <b>evaluation</b> problems in combinatorial auctions. The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop a bidding advisor to help truckload (TL) carriers overcome such challenging problems in one-shot combinatorial auctions. The proposed advisor integrates the load information in e-marketplaces with carriers' current fleet management plans, and then chooses the desirable load bundles. In this paper, a TL carrier's <b>bid</b> generation and <b>evaluation</b> problems in one-shot combinatorial auctions are formulated as a synergetic minimum cost flow problem by estimating the average synergy values between loads through the proposed approximation. The conventional solution approaches for solving the minimum cost flow problems cannot be applied to the synergetic network flow problem. Thus, we propose a column generation approach to solve this specific network flow problem. The main contribution of this paper is that a TL carrier adopting the proposed advisor can easily determine the desirable bid packages without evaluating all 2 n- 1 possible bundles of loads, where n is the number of loads.

40|$|Green {{construction}} is to conserve {{the resources and}} reduce {{the negative impact of}} construction activities on the environment to the maximum extent, with scientific management and technological progress under the premise of ensuring the quality, safety and other basic requirements. Recent years, accompanied by the rapid development of construction industry, a considerable proportion of energy and resources, particularly high-carbon materials, is consumed in the construction activities, emitting mass greenhouse gases, which have a damaging impact on the environment. This is especially for the mega public projects. Therefore, under the green and sustainable perspective, actions to control carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions in the construction industry are imperative. In this case, if CO 2 emissions reduction can be considered beforehand during the <b>bid</b> <b>evaluation</b> stage, contractors will be guided by <b>bid</b> <b>evaluation</b> indicators and therefore improve their construction schemes, enabling the construction phase to be green, energy saving and sustainable. This is because <b>bid</b> <b>evaluation</b> indicators can serve as guiding effect on the contractors. Given that CO 2 emissions are rarely given sufficient consideration in traditional <b>bid</b> <b>evaluation,</b> this study conducts a systematic analysis to identify major sources of CO 2 in construction phase and attempts to develop a conceptual computational model in terms of CO 2 emission. Then, a linguistic group decision-making framework for <b>bid</b> <b>evaluation</b> in mega public projects considering CO 2 emissions reduction is developed. In this framework, entropy, relative entropy, the standard deviation method and weighted aggregation operators are applied to determine the indicator weights, the expert weights and the information aggregation in <b>bid</b> <b>evaluation</b> decision-making. Finally, a scenario comparison between the proposed linguistic group decision-making <b>bid</b> <b>evaluation</b> framework and the traditional framework is made through a case study, and the scientific basis and reliability of this new framework are validated. The establishment of this framework can enrich the decision-making methods in construction management field. And it can provide meaningful reference for owners to choose the most qualified contractors and spur contractors to improve their construction schemes, enabling construction phase to be green, energy saving and sustainable.
