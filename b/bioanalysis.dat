25|$|LC-MS is {{frequently}} used in drug development {{because it allows}} quick molecular weight confirmation and structure identification. These features {{speed up the process}} of generating, testing, and validating a discovery starting from a vast array of products with potential application. LC-MS applications for drug development are highly automated methods used for peptide mapping, glycoprotein mapping, natural products dereplication, bioaffinity screening, in vivo drug screening, metabolic stability screening, metabolite identification, impurity identification, quantitative <b>bioanalysis,</b> and quality control.|$|E
25|$|LC-MS {{is widely}} used {{in the field of}} <b>bioanalysis</b> and is {{specially}} involved in pharmacokinetic studies of pharmaceuticals. Pharmacokinetic studies are needed to determine how quickly a drug will be cleared from the body organs and the hepatic blood flow. MS analyzers are useful in these studies because of their shorter analysis time, and higher sensitivity and specificity compared to UV detectors commonly attached to HPLC systems. One major advantage is the use of tandem MS-MS, where the detector may be programmed to select certain ions to fragment. The measured quantity is the sum of molecule fragments chosen by the operator. As long as there are no interferences or ion suppression, the LC separation can be quite quick.|$|E

Several boxes were placed {{outside of the}} Justice of Carabobo and the prosecutors office in Margarita in protest against unresolved court cases. At the Central University of Venezuela, the schools of Mechanical Engineering, Law, Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Pharmacy and <b>Bioanalysis</b> were closed after students refused to attend classes in protest against the arrest of demonstrators the previous day. Students also protested against the arrests of students at the University of Los Andes in Tachira, Simon Bolivar University and the Metropolitan University in Chacao. A bridge was closed by groups that were protesting against the lack of water and food.|$|E
2500|$|At its {{inception}} {{as a tool}} of analytical chemistry, LC-MS/MS spread rapidly and indeed continues to do so in (amongst others) bioanalytical fields, owing to its selectivity for analytes of interest. Indeed, in many cases this selectivity can lead to a misconception that it is always possible to simplify or (on occasion) almost completely remove the necessity for extensive sample preparation. Consequently, LC-MS/MS has become the analytical tool of choice for <b>bioanalysis</b> owing to its impressive sensitivity and selectivity over other, more conventional chromatographic approaches. However, during and after uptake by bioanalytical laboratories world wide, it became apparent that there were inherent problems with detection of relatively small analyte concentrations in the complex sample matrices associated with biological fluids (e.g. blood and [...] urine).|$|E
2500|$|... 10 April - <b>Bioanalysis</b> {{students}} of the Central University of Venezuela held class at the Plaza de Los Palos Grandes while protesting. A small group of protesters traveled around Caracas dressed in army men costumes and holding signs saying, â€œAs a child, they were my heroes, now the repress me". At night, {{a large group of}} students and citizens protested against their [...] "lost future" [...] and in respect to for those who have died during the protests. Peace talks between Maduro and the opposition's Democratic Unity Round Table alliance, including Henry Capriles, are televised. Foreign ministers of Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador also partake, while a Vatican representative reads a letter from Pope Francis supporting national reconciliation. [...] A follow-up meeting is announced for April 15. After the six hours of peace talks, skepticism was generated between conflicting parties and also among citizens in Venezuela.|$|E
