30|$|ITC {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} at 25 °C using a Microcal iTC 200 instrument (GE Healthcare). The cell contained 50 μmol/L Bbp 273 − 598 and the syringe contained 500 μmol/L peptide in the buffer containing 200 mmol/L NaCl and 20 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.5. Injecting peptide into buffer was performed as the <b>blank</b> <b>titration.</b> The data were fitted and analyzed using the Origin 7 software package (Microcal).|$|E
40|$|The mass {{titration}} method, {{used for}} the point of zero charge determination, was extended to the measurement of the surface charge density. The results agree with the common method, which is the acid-base titration of the colloidal suspension. The advantage of mass titration is that one {{does not need to}} perform <b>blank</b> <b>titration,</b> instead one simply adds metal oxide powder to the electrolyte aqueous solution of known pH. To cover the pH range above and below the point of zero charge, two experimental runs are necessary...|$|E
30|$|Potentiometric {{titration}} of polyelectrolyte samples {{was performed}} using a pH meter pH- 340 (Econix Express, St. Petersburg, Russia). HСl (0.2  N) and NaOH (0.2  N) {{were used as}} titrants. Polymer concentration was 2  g L− 1. The polymer solutions were titrated with HCl up to pH  2 and then with NaOH up to pH  12. Previously, a fine <b>blank</b> <b>titration</b> (titration of non-hydrolyzed polymer) was made. The absorption of OH− anions was calculated through {{the analysis of the}} titration curves and then the limits of these values were used to determine the conversion degree (А) of amide groups into carboxylate ones. All measurements were performed at T[*]=[*] 25.0 °C under nitrogen.|$|E
30|$|A 5.0 -mL Arsenazo III (0.001 [*]M) {{solution}} and 50.0 -mL monochloroacetic acid buffer (pH[*]=[*] 3.2; 0.1 [*]M) were {{added in a}} 100 -mL volumetric flask and diluted to the mark with distilled water after adjusting the pH to 3.2. A 3 -mL Arsenazo III solution (5 [*]×[*] 10 − 5 [*]M at pH[*]=[*] 3.2) was transferred to a spectrophotometric cell, and the titration was started by successive 0.2 -μL additions of each standard stock lanthanide solution (0.01 [*]M) to the cell. The absorbance data of this solution were recorded (at 380 to 780 [*]nm) after each addition, against a reagent <b>blank.</b> The <b>titration</b> was followed until the absorbance variations became small and nearly constant.|$|R
40|$|Reliable {{antibody}} based-assays {{are needed}} to evaluate the immunogenicity of current vaccines, impact of altered dosing schemes or of new vaccine formulations. An ideal assay platform would allow multiplex type-specific detection with minimal sample requirement. We used the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) electrochemiluminescence based detection platform to develop a multiplex direct virus-like particle (VLP) ELISA to detect antibodies to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 with a protocol developed for detection using the SI 6000 imager (M 4 ELISA). MSD prepared the plates in the 7 -spot/well format, using the purified VLPs (4 spots) and PBS+BSA pH 7. 4 (3 <b>blank</b> spots). Three-point <b>titrations</b> and the parallel line method were used to calculate antibody levels. Dynamic range, precision, and stability of pre-printed plates were determined using a panel of previously characterized sera. Cut-off values using children's sera were established using 99...|$|R
40|$|Author: Michael P. Czech This assay is used {{to measure}} free fatty acid release from fat cells as an {{estimate}} of lipolysis. Glycerol release can also be measured from the same samples by taking an aliquot of medium from below the fat cell layer and assaying for glycerol in the medium. *Note: This protocol contains dangerous chemicals that can cause burns to exposed skin {{and should not be}} inhaled; take all precautions to prevent burns by wearing a lab coat, extra gloves, and eye/face protection. Make sure to use the fume hood properly. Keep away from open flames; some of the chemicals are highly flammable. * ### Free Fatty Acid Release Assay. 1. Resuspend 1. 0 g fat in 1. 5 ml- 2 mls KRH+ 2. 5 %BSA. (Optional: Let the cells rest for 20 min in KRH buffer with BSA and pyruvate before adding them to the tubes listed below.) - Label 15 ml snap-cap polypropylene tubes. Add 0. 9 ml of KRH + 2. 5 % BSA pH 7. 4 to each tube. Add the other reagents as desired to the appropriate tubes, for example: - Tubes 1, 2, 3 (no glucose, no insulin, no theophylline) – 5 ul of PBS + 10 ul of 3 mM HCl + 5 ul of 100 % ethanol - Tubes 4, 5, 6 (no glucose, no insulin, + theophylline) – 5 ul of PBS + 10 ul of 3 mM HCl + 5 ul of 40 mM theophylline in ethanol - Tubes 7, 8, 9 (No glucose +insulin + theophylline) - 5 ul of PBS + 10 ul of 100 mM insulin in 3 mM HCl+ 5 ul of 40 mM theophylline - Tubes 10, 11, 12 (5 mM glucose) - 5 ul of 25 mM glucose + 10 ul of 3 mM HCl + 5 ul of 100 % ethanol - Tubes 13, 14, 15 (5 mM glucose +theophylline) - 5 ul of 25 mM glucose + 10 ul of 3 mM HCl + 5 ul of 40 mM theophylline - Tubes 16, 17, 18 (5 mM glucose +insulin + theophylline) - 5 ul of 25 mM glucose + 10 ul of 100 mM insulin + 5 ul of 40 mM theophylline - Add 0. 1 ml of cells to all of the tubes, which contain the 0. 9 ml suspension of KRH+insulin or control solutions. - Incubate the cells at 37 oC with shaking for 60 minutes to stimulate the cells. - Remove 100 ul of buffer {{from the bottom of the}} tubes after letting the tubes settle for 5 min. and place in an eppendorf tube and freeze for later studies. - Prepare 3 <b>blanks</b> for <b>titration</b> later by adding 1 ml of water to the 3 x 15 ml snap-cap polypropylene tubes, label 3 other standard tubes and set them aside until later. Prepare the standards by making a 50 mg/L stock of palmitic acid in hexane. - At this point everything should be done in a fume hood. After 60 minutes add 5 ml of Doles Extraction mixture to every tube (including the blanks and the standards), cap and shake the tubes, then let them stand for 15 min. Work with 6 tubes at one time to avoid evaporation. - Add 3 ml H 2 O and 3 ml Hexane, to the sample tubes and blanks and allow the phases to separate. Add 3 ml of palmitic acid solution in hexane (inste ad of the 3 ml of hexane alone) to the tubes for the standards. Add the water and hexane to 6 tubes, one at a time only and cap them immediately (hexane evaporates very quickly). - Remove the lower phase by aspirating and wash the upper phase by adding 3 ml of water and allowing the phases to separate. The lower solution contains water and can be poured down the sink. - Take 1 ml of upper hexane phase and put in 15 ml glass vials. For one of the tubes remove the rest of the hexane phase to give a total volume for the hexane phase to be used in calculations later. - Titrate the blanks and the standards of palmitic acid made previously at by bubbling air devoid of carbon dioxide through the samples, this is achieved by forcing air through a basic solution of 5 N NaoH. Add 0. 001 N NaOH to the point of neutrality (blue to slightly pink) and record the volume of base it took to achieve neutrality. Repeat this procedure with the samples. **Modified Doles Extraction Mixture as per Fain (100 mls) 5 mls/tube** - 80 mls isopropyl alcohol - 20 mls hexane - 2 mls 1 N H 2 SO 4 (0. 5 M H 2 SO 4) **Saturated Potassium Hydroxide** - Add potassium hydroxide pellets to a 1 -liter plastic beaker with approx. 500 mls of water. - Dissolve by stirring with a stir bar. Add more potassium hydro xide until the pellets no longer dissolve in the water. Pour the potassium hydroxide solution into a fresh bottle and let it cool. **Ethanolic KOH** - Add 20 mls of 95 % EtOH to a glass jar, add 1 ml of saturated potassium hydroxide to it - jar, mix well. **Nile Blue A Indicator Stock** - Mix powder with ethanol for a concentrated solution. Approximate concentration is 1 mg/ml. **Theophylline** - Make a 40 mM stock of theophylline in 100 % ethanol...|$|R
40|$|An automatic, sol idstate direct-readout {{system was}} built for the Buchier-Cotlove chioridometer. The device, {{described}} in detail, {{makes it possible to}} decrease sample size and titration time. The speed of chloride determinations with use of this device is tripled, while precision is significantly im-proved. Additional Keyphrases computer input #{ 149 } speeded assays with increased precision We have designed and constructed an attach-ment to the Buchier-Cotlove chioridometer that permits fully automatic titration of chloride in liquid samples and digital display of the results in the numerical units of choice. The attachment essentially consists of a variable-rate pulse genera-tor, a binary counter, and a decimal readout (Figure 1). {{it is well known that}} the amount of chloride, when titrated at a constant voltage, is linearly proportional to titration time ranging up to several hundred seconds (1). It was, therefore, possible to allow for calibration of the timing device of the instrument by simple potentiometric rate control of the pulse generator producing the desired number of counts per time unit. In addition, <b>blank</b> <b>titration</b> values were automatically corrected by incorporating a counter-reset mechanism, the logic of which allows subtraction of any desired number from 0. 1 through 9. 9 at the onset of titra-tion. ‘When the titration is completed, results are held in binary code in the binary counter, as well as displayed in decimal numbers by the digital readout. This availability of the binary signal makes the device easily adaptable to direct com-puter input...|$|E
