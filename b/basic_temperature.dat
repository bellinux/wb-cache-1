The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically using the Galerkin method. The interaction of various types of permeability heterogeneity and non-uniform <b>basic</b> <b>temperature</b> gradient functions on the stability characteristics {{of the system is}} analyzed. It is observed that the linear variation (about the mean) of the permeability and the <b>basic</b> <b>temperature</b> gradient with depth has no added effect on the criterion for the onset of convection.

Attention is focussed on the situation where the critical Marangoni number is greater than that for the case of uniform thermal gradient and the convection is not, in general, maintained. The case of adiabatic boundary condition is examined because it brings out the effect of surface tension at the free surfaces and allows a simple application of the Galerkin technique, which gives useful results. Numerical results are obtained for special cases and some general conclusions about the destabilizing effects of various <b>basic</b> <b>temperature</b> profiles and the stabilizing effect of coriolis force are presented.

40|$|This study deals {{theoretically}} {{with the}} effect of a non-uniform. <b>basic</b> <b>temperature</b> gradient on the linear stability of the oscillatory Benard-Marangoni convection in a horizontal layer of a viscous quiescent, electrically conducting fluid {{in the presence of a}} uniform vertical magnetic field. The upper surface of a fluid layer is deformably free and the lower surface is rigid. The eigenvalue equations of the perturbed state obtained from the normal mode analysis are solved by using the fourth order Runge-Kutta-Gill's method with the shooting technique. The results show that the critical Rayleigh number Ra-c and the critical Marangoni number -Ma(c) become larger as the Chandrasekhar number Q or the Biot number Bi of the upper free surface increases, and the Crispation number Cr decreases. When compared with the linear temperature profile, the inverted parabolic temperature profile indicates a reinforcement of stability, while the parabolic temperature profile indicates a diminution of stability in both Rayleigh-Benard and Benard-Marangoni convections. In addition, for the piecewise linear temperature profiles, the influences of thermal depth on the critical conditions are also obtained.

40|$|In a {{hypersonic}} {{boundary layer}} over {{a wall of}} variable curvature, the region most susceptible to Goertler vortices is the temperature adjustment layer over which the <b>basic</b> state <b>temperature</b> decreases monotonically to its free stream value. Except for a special wall curvature distribution, the evolution of Goertler vortices trapped in the temperature adjustment layer will in general be strongly affected by the boundary layer growth through the O(M sup 3 / 2) curvature of the basic state, where M is the free stream Mach number. Only when the local wavenumber becomes as large as of order M sup 3 / 8, do nonparallel effects become negligible in the determination of stability properties. In the latter case, Goertler vortices will be trapped in {{a thin layer of}} O(epsilon sup 1 / 2) thickness which is embedded in the temperature adjustment layer; here epsilon is the inverse of the local wavenumber. A weakly nonlinear theory is presented in which the initial nonlinear development of Goertler vortices in the neighborhood of the neutral position is studied and two coupled evolution equations are derived.

We first assume that the fluid is an ideal 6 as with viscosity given by Sutherland's law.

We show that their downstream evolution is governed by a set of parabolic partial differential equations and that they have the usual features of G 6 rtler vortices in incompressible boundary layers. As the local wavenumber increases, the neutral G 6 rtler number decreases and the centre of vortex activity moves towards the temperature adjustment layer.
