40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how risk premia—and {{other factors}} affecting the comparative advantages of security-funded versus deposit-funded short-run debt—altered the relative use of debt funded <b>by</b> <b>securities</b> markets since the early- 1960 s {{and the relative}} use of commercial paper during the recent financial crisis. Results indicate that lower risk premia, higher information costs, and reserve requirement costs induce less relative use of commercial paper and short-run debt funded <b>by</b> <b>securities</b> markets. This paper also finds that Federal Reserve interventions in the money market helped prevent the commercial paper market from melting down to the extent seen during the early 1930 s. ...|$|R

5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, {{took off}} his glasses before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind.

One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped <b>by</b> <b>security.</b> Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to {{put his arms around}} Blythe in an attempt to hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair {{to the edge of the}} stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped <b>by</b> <b>security.</b>|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights in}} Madagascar are {{protected}} {{under the constitution}} and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Religious, ethnic and sexual minorities are protected under the law. Freedom of association and assembly are also guaranteed under the law, although in practice the denial of permits for public assembly has occasionally been used to impede political demonstrations. Torture <b>by</b> <b>security</b> forces is rare and state repression is low relative to other countries with comparably few legal safeguards, although arbitrary arrests and the corruption of military and police officers remain problems. Ravalomanana's 2004 creation of BIANCO, an anti-corruption bureau, resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo's lower-level bureaucrats in particular, although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau.|$|E

If it was “debatable” whether Glass-Steagall was justified in the 1930s, it was easier to argue that Glass-Steagall served no legitimate purpose when the distinction between commercial and investment banking activities had been blurred by “market developments” since the 1960s.|$|R
