Major Chandpuri also had under his command a four-man team of the camel Border Security Force division. The Longewala post had no armoured vehicles, but artillery support was available from a battery of 170 Field Regiment (Veer Rajput) tasked in direct support to the battalion, and 168 Field Regiment which had been deployed to the area in secrecy just a day earlier. The direct support battery was attached to the 168 Field Regiment and served as its [...] "Sierra" [...] Battery. Immediately after PAF strikes on Indian airfields on 3 December, Chandpuri dispatched a 20-man strong patrol under Lieutenant Dharam Veer to <b>Boundary</b> <b>Pillar</b> (BP) 638, on the international border.

When the sample size {{is comparable to the}} indent size, the indentation-induced plastic zone can be affected by the sample boundary which may cause inaccurate interpretation of the mechanical properties. In this study, the sample boundary effect is investigated by performing experiments and atomistic simulations of nanoindentation into nano- and micro-scale Au pillars and bulk Au (0 0 1) surfaces. In experiments, a more compliant deformation is observed in pillar indentations compared to bulk Au. The elastic modulus decreases with increasing indent size over sample size ratio. Atomistic simulations are performed to gain insights on the mechanisms of pillar deformation and <b>pillar</b> <b>boundary</b> effect. The reduced modulus has a similar trend of decrease with increasing indent size over sample size ratio.

The number of lobes, their shape and location are dependent on the spot position.

40|$|Rock pillar {{strength}} and the characterisation of pillar failure mechanisms are of major importance in mine design. The recently developed Synthetic Rock Mass (SRM) approach provides a state-of-the-art numerical technique to more accurately characterize the mechanical properties of rock pillars. The SRM approach used in this thesis {{is based on a}} combination of two well accepted numerical methods, a Particle Flow Code (PFC 3 D) incorporating a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN). This research presents the results of a systematic study of the use of SRM modelling for hard rock pillars. The effect of assumed joint set characteristics (orientation and persistence) is first investigated through comparison of the numerical results from a series of conceptual pillar models. The joint set properties are shown to have important controls on the pillar peak strength, deformation modulus, lateral stiffness and the pillar strain-softening gradient in the post-peak stage. The effect of pillar confinement is then examined using two conceptual pillar models with varied slenderness (Width/Height ratio). The pillar confinement effect is investigated by comparing the axial and lateral stresses at the pillar core and <b>pillar</b> <b>boundaries,</b> and this effect attributed to the lateral restraint due to the loading platens. The confinement effect is further examined using a series of triaxial compression test simulations in which the pillar peak strength, residual {{strength and}} post-peak strain-softening gradient are quantified. Simulations of the development of 3 D cracks in two jointed pillar models, including wing cracks, large scale crack coalescence and step path failure are presented. A 3 D visualisation of internal pillar failure mechanisms is illustrated by examining crack development and the changes in the localised stresses within the pillar model.

40|$|Advances in {{nano-scale}} mechanical testing {{have brought}} about {{progress in the}} understanding of physical phenomena in materials and a measure of control in the fabrication of novel materials. In contrast to bulk materials that display size-invariant mechanical properties, sub-micron metallic samples show a critical dependence on sample size. The strength of nano-scale single crystalline metals is well-described by a power-law function, σαD -n, where D is a critical sample size and n is a experimentally-fit positive exponent. This relationship is attributed to source-driven plasticity and demonstrates a strengthening as the decreasing sample size begins to limit the size and number of dislocation sources. A full understanding of this size-dependence is complicated by the presence of microstructural features such as interfaces that can compete with the dominant dislocation-based deformation mechanisms. In this thesis, the effects of microstructural features such as grain boundaries and anisotropic crystallinity on nano-scale metals are investigated through uniaxial compression testing. We find that nano-sized Cu covered by a hard coating displays a Bauschinger effect and the emergence of this behavior can be explained through a simple dislocation-based analytic model. Al nano-pillars containing a single vertically-oriented coincident site lattice grain boundary are found to show similar deformation to single-crystalline nano-pillars with slip traces passing through the grain boundary. With increasing tilt angle of the grain <b>boundary</b> from the <b>pillar</b> axis, we observe a transition from dislocation-dominated deformation to grain boundary sliding. Crystallites are observed to shear along the grain boundary and molecular dynamics simulations reveal a mechanism of atomic migration that accommodates boundary sliding. We conclude with an analysis of the effects of inherent crystal anisotropy and alloying on the mechanical behavior of the Mg alloy, AZ 31. Through comparison to pure Mg, we show that the size effect dominates the strength of samples below 10 μm, that differences in the size effect between hexagonal slip systems is due to the inherent crystal anisotropy, suggesting that the fundamental mechanism of the size effect in these slip systems is the same...|$|R
