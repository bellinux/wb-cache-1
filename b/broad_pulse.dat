We have investigated two approaches for using proton-recoil in plastic scintillators to detect fast neutrons and distinguish them from gamma-ray interactions. Both approaches use the difference in travel speed between neutrons and gamma rays {{as the basis for}} separating the types of events. In the first method, we examined the pulses generated during scattering in a plastic scintillator to see if they provide a means for distinguishing fast-neutron events from gamma-ray events. The slower speed of neutrons compared to gamma rays results in the production of <b>broader</b> <b>pulses</b> when neutrons scatter several times within a plastic scintillator. In contrast, gamma-ray interactions should produce narrow pulses, even if multiple scattering takes place, because the time between successive scattering is small.

However, the difference in pulse widths between neutrons and gamma rays using the best commercially available scintillators was not sufficiently large to provide a practical means for distinguishing fast neutrons and gamma rays on a pulse-by-pulse basis.

Analysis in narrower energy windows shows that the single <b>broad</b> <b>pulse</b> is significantly detected up to ~ 10 MeV. Above 10 MeV we do detect marginally significant (2. 1 &# 0963;) modulation with an indication for the <b>broad</b> <b>pulse.</b> However, imaging analysis shows the presence of a strong 5. 6 &# 0963; source at the position of the pulsar. To investigate this further, we have also analysed contemporaneous CGRO EGRET data (> 30 MeV) collected over a nearly 4 year period. In the 30 - 100 Me V energy window, adjacent to the COMPTEL 10 - 30 MeV range, a 4. 4 &# 0963; source can be attributed to PSR B 1509 - 58. Timing analysis in this energy window yields an insignificant signal of 1. 1 &# 0963;, but with a shape somewhat {{similar to that of the}} COMPTEL 10 - 30 MeV lightcurve. Combining the two pulse-phase distributions results in a suggestive double-peaked pulsed signal above the background level estimated in the spatial analyses, with one broad peak near phase 0. 38 (aligned with the pulse observed at lower energies) and a second narrower peak near phase 0. 85, which is absent for energies below 10 MeV. The modulation significance is, however, only 2. 3 &# 0963; and needs confirmation. Spectral analysis based on the excess counts in the <b>broad</b> <b>pulse</b> of the lightcurve shows that extrapolation of the OSSE power-law spectral fit with index - 1. 68 describes our data well up to 10 MeV.

Such a break in the spectrum of PSR B 1509 - 58 bas recently been interpreted in the framework of polar cap models for the explanation of gamma-ray pulsars, as a signature of the exotic photon splitting process in the strong magnetic field of PSR B 1509 - 58.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of hydrodynamical {{simulations}} of gamma-ray burst jets propagating through their stellar progenitor material and subsequently through the surrounding circumstellar medium. We consider both jets that are injected with constant properties {{in the center of}} the star and jets injected with a variable luminosity. We show that the variability properties of the jet outside the star are a combination of the variability injected by the engine and the variability caused by the jet propagation through the star. Comparing power spectra for the two cases shows that the variability injected by the engine is preserved even if the jet is heavily shocked inside the star. Such shocking produces additional variability at long time scales, of order several seconds. Our findings suggest that the <b>broad</b> <b>pulses</b> of several seconds duration typically observed in gamma-ray bursts are due to the interaction of the jet with the progenitor, while the short-timescale variability, characterized by fluctuations on time scales of milliseconds, has to be injected at the base of the jet.

We then investigate the transport of optical pulses through dispersive media with negative dielectric permittivity and negative refractive index choosing the geometry such that no resonant effects come into play.

Next generation, higher current machines will allow for larger mass arrays and comparable or higher velocity implosions to be reached, possibly extending these result. dis the current is pushed above 20 MA, conventional machine design based on a 100 ns implosion time results in higher voltages, hence higher cost and power flow risk. Another approach, which shifts the risk to the load configuration, is to increase the implosion time to minimize the voltage. This approach is being investigated in a series of experimental campaigns on the Saturn and Z machines. In this paper, both experimental and two dimensional computational modeling of the fist long implosion Z experiments will be presented. The experimental data shows <b>broader</b> <b>pulses,</b> lower powers, and larger pinch diameters compared to the corresponding short pulse data. By employing a nested array configuration, the pinch diameter was reduced by 50 % with a corresponding increase in power of > 30 %. Numerical simulations suggest load velocity is the dominating mechanism behind these results...|$|R
