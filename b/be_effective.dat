The influence of different moisture levels (47, 57 and 67 w. b. %), in two loading orientation (longitudinal and transverse) and three loading speed (4, 6 and 8 mm min- 1) on the mechanical properties of pea such as maximum deformation, rupture force, rupture energy, toughness {{and the power to}} break the pea was investigated.
