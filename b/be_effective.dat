Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain.

The influence of different moisture levels (47, 57 and 67 w. b. %), in two loading orientation (longitudinal and transverse) and three loading speed (4, 6 and 8 mm min- 1) on the mechanical properties of pea such as maximum deformation, rupture force, rupture energy, toughness {{and the power to}} break the pea was investigated.
