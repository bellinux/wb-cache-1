5|$|It {{is likely}} that Bede's work, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so widely copied, {{discouraged}} others from writing histories and may even {{have led to the}} disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works.|$|E

5000|$|Some of the {{historically}} relevant approaches to quantum mechanics have now themselves become [...] "minority interpretations", or {{widely seen as}} obsolete. In this sense, there is {{a variety of reasons}} for why a specific approach may <b>be</b> considered marginal: <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a very specialized sub-variant of a more widely known class of interpretations, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> seen as obsolete (in spite of possible historical significance), <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a very recent suggestion that has not received wide attention, or <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> rejected as flawed.|$|R

5|$|Abbey of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke) was {{designed}} in 1878 by J.E. Gnudtzmann in the Neo-Romanesque style. The original Church of Our Lady {{from the early}} 12th century was pulled down after the Reformation <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> old and unstable, but the 12th-century tower and the original portal with sculpted decorations can still be seen. The carved pulpit dates to around 1581.|$|E

5|$|After its {{victory in}} the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the British Empire was deeply in debt. Looking for new sources of revenue, the British Parliament sought, for the first time, to {{directly}} tax the colonies, beginning with the Sugar Act of 1764. The earlier Molasses Act of 1733, a tax on shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> widely bypassed by smuggling, which {{was seen as a}} victimless crime.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World Congress in 1948, the International Secretariat {{attempted}} to open communications with Josip Broz Tito's regime in Yugoslavia. In their analysis, it {{differed from the}} rest of the Eastern Bloc <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> established by the partisans of World War II who had fought against Nazi occupation, as opposed to by Stalin's invading armies. The British RCP, led by Jock Haston and supported by Ted Grant, were highly critical of this move.|$|E
5|$|Aged 18, Dot married Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock). The {{following}} year, {{he forced}} her to have an abortion; threatening to leave her if she did not, but left anyway <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a bigamous marriage. While Dot was giving birth to their son, Nick (John Altman), Charlie {{was having an affair}} with her sister, Rose, in Liverpool. She raised Nick alone, but was not an affectionate mother.|$|E

50|$|The {{stadium is}} nicknamed Estádio da Curuzú <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{located near the}} Curuzú street. Estádio da Curuzú is also nicknamed the Vovô da Cidade (meaning City's Grandpa) <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the oldest stadium of Pará state.|$|R
5|$|Although the Congress of Tucumán {{had already}} formalized {{the flag of}} Argentina, the Army of the Andes did not use it, {{choosing}} a banner with two columns, light blue and white, and a coat of arms roughly similar to the Coat of arms of Argentina. The army {{did not use the}} flag of Argentina <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not exclusively an Argentine army.|$|E
5|$|Although the Richard III Society {{remained}} {{interested in}} discussing the possible location of the king's grave, they did not search for his remains. Individual members suggested possible lines of investigation, but neither the University of Leicester nor local historians and archaeologists took up the challenge, probably <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> widely thought that the grave site had been built over or the skeleton had been scattered, as John Speed's account suggested.|$|E
5|$|As {{it turned}} out, maybe Hadl {{had led him}} {{to believe that we}} had come down to reach some sort of {{monetary}} settlement with him. And it was really funny <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not what he was expecting and his reaction was shock.|$|E
50|$|The statue {{has caused}} {{controversy}} in Peru, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{seen as a}} government endorsement of Christianity, because its lighting system is deemed unsightly, and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> seen as too similar to the Christ the Redeemer statue.|$|R

5|$|Telecommunication over fixed {{lines is}} called {{point-to-point}} communication <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> between one transmitter and one receiver.

5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{frequently}} propagated {{through social}} media and broadcast on Twitch.tv and YouTube, Agar.io {{was a quick}} success. The agar.io website (for the browser version) was ranked by Alexa {{as one of the}} 1,000 most visited websites and the mobile versions were downloaded more than ten million times during their first week. During 2015, Agar.io was Google's most searched video game. It was Google's second-most searched game in the United States in 2016.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{used as a}} {{water supply}} for agriculture, most of the channel {{remained}} in water, although bridges were lowered. Since the 1970s, the Grantham Canal Society have been working towards its restoration, and two stretches are navigable to small vessels. Full restoration will require a new route where the canal joins the Trent, as road building has effectively severed the original route.|$|E
5|$|Bodanzky {{considered}} the screenplay a key-element {{on the production}} of Brainstorm; it was her only way of attracting a good cast and staff <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> her first feature film. It aroused interest of lead actors Santoro, Bastos, Kiss, and the producers Sara Silveira, Caio and Fabiano Gullane. Marco Muller, Italian producer of Fabrica Cinema, was also lured by the script, and the film became a Brazil-Italy co-production.|$|E
50|$|For example, 5 is a {{congruent}} number <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{the area}} of a 20/3, 3/2, 41/6 triangle. Similarly, 6 is a congruent number <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{the area of}} a 3,4,5 triangle. 3 is not a congruent number.|$|R

50|$|Phloroglucinol is {{a useful}} {{intermediate}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> polyfunctional. Furthermore, the deprotonated intermediate in the interconversion of the two forms, referred to as an enolate anion, is important in carbonyl chemistry, in large part <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a strong nucleophile.|$|R
5|$|By 1891, Marsh {{published}} a more familiar view of Stegosaurus, {{with a single}} row of plates. This was dropped fairly early on (apparently <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> poorly understood how the plates were embedded in the skin and they were thought to overlap too much in this arrangement). It was revived, in somewhat modified form, in the 1980s, by Stephen Czerkas, based on the arrangement of iguana dorsal spines.|$|E
5|$|CBS head of {{programming}} Fred Silverman offered Sonny and Cher their own television program after he noticed them as guest-hosts on The Merv Griffin Show in 1971. The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour premiered {{as a summer}} replacement series on August 1, 1971, and had six episodes. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a ratings success, the couple returned that December with a full-time show.|$|E
5|$|Design of {{the bridge}} was awarded to Aas-Jakobsen and Det Norske Veritas, the former who also {{performed}} dynamic analysis and structural engineering. Architects were Hindhammer–Sundt–Thomassen, Lund & Løvseth, and Lund & Slaatto. An H pylon was chosen instead of an A pylon both <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> more functional, and would be more aesthetic {{in conjunction with the}} other bridges in the area, particularly three suspension bridges.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, Jacob's blessing {{is of the}} {{greatest}} value, both <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{the only source of}} information for certain of the tribes in ancient times, and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an aid in rendering the sources (for example, [...] ) more intelligible.|$|R

50|$|The simple {{continued}} fraction expansion of Champernowne's constant {{has been studied}} as well. Kurt Mahler showed that the constant is transcendental; therefore its {{continued fraction}} does not terminate (<b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not rational) and <b>is</b> aperiodic (<b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not an irreducible quadratic).|$|R
