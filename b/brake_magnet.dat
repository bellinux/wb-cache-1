25|$|Providing {{the relay}} is free from dirt, the metal disc and the spindle with its contact {{will reach the}} fixed contact, thus sending a signal to trip and isolate the circuit, within its {{designed}} time and current specifications. Drop off current of the relay is much lower than its operating value, and once reached the relay will be reset in a reverse motion by {{the pressure of the}} control spring governed by the <b>braking</b> <b>magnet.</b>|$|R
25|$|In an {{overcurrent}} condition, a {{value of}} current will be reached that overcomes the control spring pressure on the spindle and the <b>braking</b> <b>magnet,</b> causing the metal disc to rotate towards the fixed contact. This initial movement of the disc is also held off to a critical positive value of current by small slots that are often cut {{into the side of}} the disc. The time taken for rotation to make the contacts is not only dependent on current but also the spindle backstop position, known as the time multiplier (tm). The time multiplier is divided into 10 linear divisions of the full rotation time.|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the asynchronous torque components (average cage, <b>magnet</b> <b>braking</b> torque and pulsating) for a single-phase capacitor-start, capacitor-run permanent magnet motor. The computed envelope of pulsating torque superimposed over the average electromagnetic torque leads to an accurate prediction of starting torque. The developed approach is realized by means of a combination of symmetrical components and d-q axes theory and it can be extended for any m-phase AC motor - induction, synchronous reluctance or synchronous permanent magnet. The resultant average electromagnetic torque is determined by superimposing the asynchronous torques and <b>magnet</b> <b>braking</b> torque effects...|$|R

50|$|Both {{power off}} brakes are {{considered}} to be engaged when no power is applied to them. They are typically required to hold or to stop alone {{in the event of a}} loss of power or when power is not available in a machine circuit. Permanent <b>magnet</b> <b>brakes</b> have a very high torque for their size, but also require a constant current control to offset the permanent magnetic field. Spring applied brakes do not require a constant current control, they can use a simple rectifier, but are larger in diameter or would need stacked friction disks to increase the torque.|$|R
5000|$|Power off brakes stop or hold a load when {{electrical}} power is either accidentally lost or intentionally disconnected. In the past, {{some companies have}} referred to these as [...] "fail safe" [...] brakes. These brakes are typically used on or near an electric motor. Typical applications include robotics, holding brakes for Z axis ball screws and servo motor brakes. Brakes are available in multiple voltages and can have either standard backlash or zero backlash hubs. Multiple disks {{can also be used}} to increase brake torque, without increasing brake diameter. There are 2 main types of holding brakes. The first is spring applied brakes. The second is permanent <b>magnet</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The bulk {{of these}} {{features}} are concentrated {{at the base of}} the attraction; foremost among these is the tower's permanent <b>magnet</b> <b>braking</b> system. Using the principles of magnetism, these brakes slow down the falling gondola gently, yet rapidly, without actually contacting the gondola. These magnets do not require electricity to produce their magnetic fields, and as such they are able to function even in the event of a total power failure. Lastly, pneumatic plungers [...] "catch" [...] the slowly descending gondola and allow it to settle to the tower base. Like the magnetic brakes, these plungers do not require power to function properly. Acrophobia requires the rider to be at least fifty-four inches tall.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic braking is a {{long-established}} {{application of}} Lenz's law. A rigorous {{analysis of the}} laws governing this problem involves solving Maxwell's equations in a time-dependent situation. Approximate models {{have been developed to}} describe different experiences related to this phenomenon. In this paper we present a new method for the analysis of the magnetic <b>braking</b> using a <b>magnet</b> fixed to the glider of an air track. The forces acting on the glider, a result of the eddy currents, can be easily observed and measured. As a consequence of the air track inclination, the glider accelerates at the beginning, although it asymptotically tends towards a uniform rectilinear movement characterized by a terminal speed. This speed depends on the interaction between the magnetic field and the conductivity properties of the air track. Compared with previous related approaches, in our experimental setup the magnet fixed to the glider produces a magnetic braking force which acts continuously, rather than over a short period of time. The experimental results satisfactorily concur with the theoretical models adapted to this configuration. Comment: 15 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{changing}} {{magnetic field}} will induce eddy currents in the conductor. These currents will dissipate {{energy in the}} conductor and generate drag force. It is found that Aluminium is the best material as conductor compared to Copper and Zinc. Also, {{it is found that}} the larger thickness of disc, more number of turns of electromagnet and higher electrical conductivity of conductor influences the generation of greater <b>braking</b> torque. Permanent <b>magnet</b> eddy current <b>brake</b> uses Neodymium – Iron – Boron (NdFeB) magnets. The analysis of permanent magnet eddy current shows that the parallel magnetised eddy current topology has the superior braking torque capability. In electrically controlled eddy current braking system subjected to time varying fields in different wave forms, the triangular wave field application resulted in highest braking torque. Electromagnetic brakes were found to interfere with the signalling and train control system. Permanent <b>magnet</b> eddy current <b>brakes</b> are a simple and reliable alternative to mechanical or electromagnetic brakes in transportation applications. Greater the speed greater is the eddy current braking efficiency. Hence, author intends to work on the development and investigation of permanent <b>magnet</b> eddy current <b>braking</b> system...|$|R
40|$|The {{current work}} {{presents}} a statically balanced system with novel design, which incorporates compression springs {{as a positive}} stiffness and magnets as a negative stiffness. The mechanism varies the force in the positive stiffness elements from zero to maximum. In this way, the balancing system {{can be used as}} a force amplifier. The goal of the current design is to be used in a friction <b>brake.</b> A specific <b>magnet</b> configuration is used to achieve a relatively linear force-distance relationship. The configuration consist of three block-magnets, from which one magnet translates and two magnets are placed in a stationary steel U-shape. This force-distance relationship is balanced by a piecewise linear characteristic achieved by using multiple compression springs with different action-initiation points. The proof-of-concept build consists of a lever mechanism with a lever arm of 100 mm, one set of magnets and three compression springs. By varying the position of the lever from to 5. 04, the force in the springs is varied between 0 N and 872 N. Experimental evaluation of the prototype reveals a minimum of 97 % force reduction in the prototype compared to the unbalanced prototype.

40|$|Recent {{designs for}} {{brake-by-wire}} systems use "resolvers" to provide accurate and continuous measurements for the absolute position {{and speed of}} the rotor of the electric actuators in <b>brake</b> callipers (permanent <b>magnet</b> DC motors). Resolvers are absolute-angle transducers that are integrated with estimator modules called "angle tracking observer" and together they provide position and speed measurements. Current designs for angle-tracking observers are unstable in applications with high acceleration and/or speed. In this paper, we introduce a new angle-tracking observer in which a closed-loop linear time-invariant (LTI) observer is integrated with a quadrature encoder. Finite-gain stability of the proposed design and its robustness to three different kinds of parameter variations are proven based on theorems of input-output stability in nonlinear control theory. In our experiments, we examined the performance of our observer and two other methods (a well-known LTI observer and an extended Kalman filter) to estimate the position and speed of a brake-by-wire actuator. The results show {{that because of the}} very high speed and acceleration of the actuator in this application, the LTI observer and Kalman filter cannot track the rotor position and diverge. In contrast, with a properly designed open-loop transfer function and selecting a suitable switching threshold, our proposed angle-tracking observer is stable and highly accurate in a brake-by-wire applicatio...|$|R
5000|$|Disk {{electromagnetic}} brakes {{are used}} on vehicles such as trains, and power {{tools such as}} circular saws, to stop the blade quickly when the power is turned off. A disk eddy current brake consists of a conductive non-ferromagnetic metal disc (rotor) attached to the axle of the vehicle's wheel, with an electromagnet located with its poles {{on each side of}} the disk, so the magnetic field passes through the disk. The electromagnet allows the braking force to be varied. When no current is passed through the electromagnet's winding, there is no braking force. When the driver steps on the brake pedal, current is passed through the electromagnet windings, creating a magnetic field, The larger the current in the winding, the larger the eddy currents and the stronger the braking force. Power tool <b>brakes</b> use permanent <b>magnets,</b> which are moved adjacent to the disk by a linkage when the power is turned off. The kinetic energy of the vehicle's motion is dissipated in Joule heating by the eddy currents passing through the disk's resistance, so like conventional friction disk brakes, the disk becomes hot. Unlike in the linear brake below, the metal of the disk passes repeatedly through the magnetic field, so disk eddy current brakes get hotter than linear eddy current brakes.|$|R
