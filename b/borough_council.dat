5000|$|Between 1965 and 1986 the boroughs {{were part}} of a two-tier system of {{government}} and shared power with the Greater London Council (GLC). The split of powers and functions meant that the Greater London Council was responsible for [...] "wide area" [...] services such as fire, ambulance, flood prevention, and refuse disposal; with the London <b>borough</b> <b>councils</b> responsible for [...] "personal" [...] services such as social care, libraries, cemeteries and refuse collection. Several London <b>borough</b> <b>councils</b> and the GLC were involved in the rate-capping rebellion of 1985. On 1 April 1986 the GLC was abolished and the <b>borough</b> <b>councils</b> gained responsibility for some services that had been provided by the Greater London Council, such as waste disposal. The Inner London Education Authority continued to exist as an ad hoc authority. In 1990 it was abolished and the Inner London <b>borough</b> <b>councils</b> also became local education authorities.|$|R

5|$|In the 1960s, {{the value}} of the towpath as a leisure amenity began to be recognised. The Deputy County Clerk for Hampshire walked along the towpath from end to end in 1966, {{together}} with members of the Ramblers Association. He decided that rather than challenge the legality of the towpath diversions, he would invite the local authorities through which the navigation ran to assume responsibility for maintaining the towpath. These organisations were Southampton County <b>Borough</b> <b>Council,</b> Eastleigh <b>Borough</b> <b>Council,</b> Winchester Rural District Council and Winchester City Council. The construction of weirs at most of the locks by the Southern Water Authority resulted in water levels being restored on significant parts of the navigation. The powers of the navigation were enshrined in Acts of Parliament obtained in 1665, 1767, 1795, 1802, 1811 and 1820, none of which have been repealed.|$|E
