40|$|Abstract: Operational {{monitoring}} of vegetation and land surface change over large areas can make {{good use of}} satellite sensors that measure radiance reflected from the Earth’s surface. Monitoring programs use multiple images for complete spatial coverage over time. Accurate retrievals of vegetation cover and vegetation change estimates can be hampered by variation, in both space and time, in the measured radiance, caused by atmospheric conditions, topography, sensor location, and sun elevation. In order to obtain estimates of cover that are comparable between images, and to retrieve accurate estimates of change, these sources of variation must be removed. In this paper we present a preprocessing scheme for minimising atmospheric, topographic and <b>bi-directional</b> <b>reflectance</b> effects on Landsat- 5 TM, Landsat- 7 ETM+ and SPOT- 5 HRG imagery. The approach involves atmospheric correction to compute surface-leaving radiance, and <b>bi-directional</b> <b>reflectance</b> modelling to remove the effects of topography and angular variation in <b>reflectance.</b> The <b>bi-directional</b> <b>reflectance</b> model has been parameterised for eastern Australia, but the general approach is more widely applicable.

40|$|The {{simplest}} postulation (without wavelength or directional subscripts) for Kirchhoff’s law reads Ɛ= 1 -R, where Ɛ is emissivity and R is reflectance.

Such a condition is rarely found in laboratory on Earth and never met in space; nevertheless, for simplification or lacking of suitable emissivity datasets (and being reflectance measurements much easier than emissivity measurements), Kirchhoff’s law is widely used to substitute emissivity with 1 minus reflectance measurements (and often bi-conical or <b>bi-directional</b> <b>reflectance</b> is used, and not hemispherical as it should be).

SVISSR/FY- 2 C sensor acquires image covering the full disk with a temporal resolution of 30 minutes. The LST and LSE retrieval procedures can be shown as follows. Firstly, taking into the fact that land surface is non-lambertian characteristics, the time-series <b>bi-directional</b> <b>reflectances</b> in SVISSR/FY- 2 C MIR channel 4 (3. 8 mu m) were estimated from the combined MIR and TIR channels with day-night SVISSR/FY- 2 C data. A diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model was used to correct for the atmospheric effects. The atmospheric profile data provided by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) were adopted {{with the aid of}} the radiative transfer code (MODTRAN 4. 0). Secondly, a Bidirectional <b>Reflectance</b> <b>Distribution</b> Function (BRDF) model named as RossThick-LiSparse-R model was used to estimate the hemispherical directional reflectance in MIR channel from the time-series <b>bi-directional</b> <b>reflectance</b> data. Then, the LSE in MIR channel can be retrieved according to Kirchhoff's law. The LSEs in TIR channels can be estimated based on the Temperature Independent Spectral Indices (TISI) concept.

Finally, a cross-validation method was used to evaluate the retrieval accuracies with the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD 11 B 1 LST/LSE V 5 product.

I propose SBRDFs as a surface appearance representation for computer graphics and present a complete system for their use. I acquire SBRDFs of real surfaces using a device that simultaneously measures the BRDF of every point on a material. The system has the novel ability to measure anisotropy (direction of threads, scratches, or grain) uniquely at each surface point. I fit BRDF parameters using an efficient nonlinear optimization approach specific to BRDFs. SBRDFs can be rendered using graphics hardware. My approach yields significantly more detailed, general surface appearance than existing techniques for a competitive rendering cost. I also propose an SBRDF rendering method for global illumination using prefiltered environment maps. This improves on existing prefiltered environment map techniques by decoupling the BRDF from the environment maps, so a single set of maps {{may be used to}} illuminate the unique BRDFs at each surface point.

40|$|Surface albedo {{is a key}} {{parameter}} in {{the energy}} balance of glaciers and ice sheets because it controls the shortwave radiation budget, which is often the dominant term of a glacier's surface energy balance. Monitoring surface albedo is a key application of remote sensing and achieving consistency between instruments is crucial to accurate assessment of changing albedo. Here we {{take advantage of a}} high resolution (5 m) airborne multispectral dataset that was collected over Langjökull, Iceland in 2007, and compare it with near contemporaneous ETM+ and MODIS imagery. All three radiance datasets are converted to reflectance by applying commonly used atmospheric correction schemes: 6 S and FLAASH. These are used to derive broadband albedos. We first assess the similarity of albedo values produced by different atmospheric correction schemes for the same instrument, then contrast results from different instruments. In this way we are able to evaluate the consistency of the available atmospheric correction algorithms and to consider the impacts of different spatial resolutions. We observe that FLAASH leads to the derivation of surface albedos greater than when 6 S is used. Albedo is shown to be highly variable at small spatial scales. This leads to consistent differences associated with specific facies types between different resolution instruments, in part attributable to different surface <b>bi-directional</b> <b>reflectance</b> <b>distribution</b> functions.

A key component of atrium daylighting, especially in tall atria, is the daylight reflected on to the atrium walls. This study examines the impacts of well geometries and different diffuse <b>reflectance</b> <b>distributions</b> of walls on variations of vertical internally reflected daylight across the walls of atria. The square atrium models used in the study have a very wide range of well index (WI) values, ranging from 0. 25 (shallow atrium) to 2. 0 (deep atrium). In addition, two well wall <b>reflectance</b> <b>distribution</b> patterns were used, namely horizontal and vertical bands. Validated by scale model measurements, the lighting package Radiance was used to predict vertical internally reflected daylight levels. It was found that different <b>reflectance</b> <b>distributions</b> do have an impact on the vertical internally reflected components across the wall of the square atrium models under overcast sky conditions. The impact relates to the orientation of the band with different <b>reflectance</b> <b>distributions</b> on the wall. For central wall areas at locations greater than one third of atrium height the horizontal <b>distributions</b> of the <b>reflectances</b> significantly affect the vertical internally reflected components.
