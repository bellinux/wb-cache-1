The pygostyle controls all the movement in the tail and controls the feathers in the tail. This gives the tail a larger surface area which helps keep the bird in the air.|$|E
25|$|The Griffon Bruxellois {{is known}} to have a huge heart, and a strong desire to snuggle and be with its master. They display a visible air of self-importance. A Griffon should not be shy or aggressive, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> emotionally sensitive, and because of this, should be socialized {{carefully}} at a young age. Griffons should also be alert, inquisitive and interested in their surroundings.|$|E
25|$|Austral storm petrels are the {{smallest}} of all the seabirds, {{ranging in size from}} 15–26cm in length. There are two body shapes in the family; the austral storm petrels have short wings, square tails, elongated skulls, and long legs.

25|$|In {{terms of}} ancestry, 23,875 people claimed American ancestry, which is {{equivalent}} to 5.8% of San Juan's population. Other sizable ancestry groups included those of Italian descent, French descent, and West Indian descent. People of Italian descent numbered at 1,694, forming 0.4% of the population; people of French descent numbered at 1,064, forming 0.2% of the population. Finally, those of West Indian descent numbered at 1,393, forming 0.3% of San Juan's population. Approximately 1,026 people claimed Sub-Saharan African ancestry; 719 claimed Irish ancestry; 646 claimed German ancestry; 431 claimed Arab ancestry, and 346 claimed English ancestry.

25|$|Andersen et al. {{were able}} to {{generate}} {{a model of the}} (S)-citalopram binding site in human SERT by combining mutational analysis and comparative modeling where they found out that Asn-177 and Phe-341 where key determinants for (S)-citalopram potency and high affinity inhibition in addition to Tyr-95, Asp-98, Ile-172 and Ser438 previously described, where three functional groups of the inhibitors structure bind to the transporters amino acids. (S)-citalopram is positioned as that the cyanophthalane-. fluorophenyl- and methylaminoprpyl moieties occupy three different sub-pockets within the SERT binding pocket. Ile-172 and Phe-341 are likely not in direct contact with the drug molecule, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> important for controlling alignment of the inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|Locally {{produced}} Etruscan vases probably {{date from}} the 7th century BC. At first, they resemble black-figure models from Corinth and eastern Greece. It is assumed {{that in the early}} phase primarily Greek immigrants were the producers. The first important style was Pontic pottery painting. Afterward, in the period between 530 and 500 BC, the Micali Painter and his workshop followed. At this time Etruscan artists tended to follow Attic models and produced primarily amphoras, hydriai and jugs. They usually had komos and symposia scenes and animal friezes. Mythological scenes are less common, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> carefully produced. The black-figure style ended around 480 BC. Toward the end a mannerist style developed, and sometimes a rather careless silhouette technique.|$|E

25|$|The pear-shaped Takifugu, {{like all}} pufferfish, are not fast {{swimmers}} as they mainly use their pectoral fins for propulsion, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> manoeuvrable {{and able to}} hover, swim backwards, and change direction {{much more quickly than}} most other types of fish. As a result, they are rarely found in open water and prefer to stay relatively close to the sea bed where they can explore complex environments such as oyster beds, seagrass meadows, and rocky reefs. Nevertheless, these fish are very curious and active, and in some cases even aggressive against other fugu or other fish. In the event of danger, the fish inflates itself by filling its extremely elastic stomach with water (or air when outside of the water) until the fish is almost spherical (hence the name blowfish or pufferfish).|$|E
25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E

2500|$|Adult {{males are}} notably {{tolerant}} {{of each other}} in the group, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> aggressive towards males of other groups. Intergroup aggressive behaviors have been observed in El Tuparro, which resulted in one group fleeing towards the central parts of their territory. Alpha males seem to exercise a [...] "control position" [...] {{at the center of the}} group, since all members are extremely conscious and alert to his location, and they all observe his reactions. If the alpha reacts with intense fear or panic or if he pays close attention to something, all members of the troop react similarly. The presence of adult males seems to lend psychological support to the smaller adult females. Defler noticed that more timid females often became quite aggressive towards him when a male appeared on the scene, although the females often needed to press up against the flank of the male for reassurance.|$|E
2500|$|Bristol Motor Speedway is {{the fourth}} largest sports venue in America and the eighth largest in the world, housing up to 162,000 people. The track is so short that speeds here are far lower than is typical on most NASCAR oval tracks, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> fast {{compared}} to other short tracks due to the high banking. These features make for {{a considerable amount of}} [...] "paint swapping" [...] at the NASCAR races where the initial starting grid of 40 vehicles each in the Monster Energy Cup Series & the Xfinity Series, and 32 in the Truck Series, extends almost halfway around the track, meaning that slower qualifiers begin the race almost half a lap down. The congestion inherent in this facility {{and the power of the}} cars and trucks has been likened to [...] "flying fighter jets in a gymnasium" [...] (or a [...] "washing machine" [...] or a [...] "toilet"). The track is one that tends to be either loved or hated by the fans and the drivers. Purists who grew up driving or attending races at older short tracks located at fairgrounds and similar places tend to love Bristol, while those raised on superspeedway racing tend to chafe at the lower speeds.|$|E
