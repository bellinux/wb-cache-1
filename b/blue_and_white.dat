5|$|Stockport County's {{traditional}} kit colours are <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> {{although they}} have played in other colours throughout their history. Originally competing in <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> striped jerseys and white shorts, they experimented with red and white stripes in the early 1900s, and from the mid-1930s to mid-1960s played in white jerseys and black shorts. No set pattern has been established for the club's use of <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> as main colours, as they have played at various times in a white jersey with a blue band and blue shorts and a blue jersey with white pin stripes and white shorts. They made a short experiment with an Argentina-style kit, light <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes with black shorts, after the 1978 World Cup. This was abandoned after {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War, and the club returned to <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s. County marked their 125th anniversary during 2008 by bringing in a third kit – a gold colour with black trim. The kit was worn on 17 occasions, all away trips. The strip was retired 'undefeated' {{at the end of the}} year, having been worn for 13 victories and 4 draws. The kit was also worn during a match against Chester City which was abandoned after 59 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Bristol Rovers {{are known}} for their {{distinctive}} <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> quartered shirts, which they have worn for most of their history. The current home kit consists of a light <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> quartered shirt and white shorts, while the away kit is black and gold with the same colours as the trim. During the 2008–09 season a special third strip, which is black with a gold sash, and is a reproduction of the original Black Arab shirt, was used for a single match to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the club.|$|E
5|$|A {{competition}} {{for a new}} flag, held in June 2007, received 993 entries. Under the terms of UN talks, all such symbols would have to reflect the multi-ethnic nature of Kosovo, avoiding {{the use of the}} Albanian or Serbian double-headed eagles or the use of solely red and black or red, <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> color schemes. Red and black are the colours used on the Albanian flag; red, <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> are the main colours used on the Serbian flag. Additionally, all entries had to be rectangular and have a 2:3 proportion. The Kosovo Symbols Commission eventually selected three designs, which were then voted on by the Assembly of Kosovo (with a two-thirds majority required for approval), when independence was declared after the status talks. The three proposals selected were forwarded to the Assembly on 4 February 2008.|$|E

5|$|Leek's home colours have {{traditionally}} been all blue, and their away colours all yellow, both colours which reflect the town's coat of arms, which is predominantly blue and gold. The club has also used a <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> kit {{similar to that of}} Blackburn Rovers, and a red and black away kit.|$|E

5|$|The club colours, {{reflected}} in their crest and kit, are sky <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> with sky blue shirts and white shorts being the club's traditional kit colours. The main rivals of MFF are Helsingborgs IF, IFK Göteborg and historically IFK Malmö. MFF Support is the official fan club of Malmö FF.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} colours of all IFK {{associations are}} <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> and IFK Göteborg is no exception. Soon after the club's foundation in 1904, {{it was decided}} that the kit should consist of a <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> striped shirt with blue shorts. But the design was too costly and instead a cheaper alternative was used. Thus the club's first kit used a blue shirt with a single horizontal white stripe and a four-pointed star, one of the IFK association symbols, in white on the chest. During the next few years, white or blue shirts without stripes were used. In 1910, a kit comprising a <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> vertically striped shirt and blue shorts was used for the first time inspired by the kit of Kjøbenhavns Boldklub. This kit has remained as the home colours ever since. The small amount of sponsor logos, together with the longtime use of <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes, has made the kit a classic in Swedish football. The most common away kit has been red and white in different styles, though other colour combinations, for example orange and white, have been used, mainly in the 1990s and 2000s. The away kit introduced in 2005 once again used red and white. An almost completely white third kit with blue details was introduced in mid-2007 after requests from supporters. In the 2010s, the away-kit colours have seen much variation, including a pink shirt with black shorts, a black kit with light-grey details, the more traditional red kit with white trimmings, and a purple kit with white details introduced in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Although the Congress of Tucumán {{had already}} formalized {{the flag of}} Argentina, the Army of the Andes did not use it, {{choosing}} a banner with two columns, light <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> and a coat of arms roughly similar to the Coat of arms of Argentina. The army {{did not use the}} flag of Argentina because it was not exclusively an Argentine army.|$|E

5|$|Baldrics {{are worn}} {{from the right}} {{shoulder}} to left hip and are color specific by nation. In the United States, Panama, and the Philippines, baldrics are red, white, and blue. Red and white baldrics are used in Canada and Poland; red, white, and green in Mexico; and <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> in Guatemala. Service baldrics include a scabbard for a sword and are worn over the coat while social baldrics are worn under the coat.|$|E
5|$|Ceramic {{that were}} {{imported}} to Gedi represent either {{direct or indirect}} trade with China, South Asia, and the Islamic world. Islamic pottery found at Gedi was wheel spun, glazed, and kiln fired, which includes sgraffiato, Yemeni black on yellow ceramics, and figured wares frequently depicting floral designs on <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> panels. Sgraffiato is red-bodied earthenware with yellow or green glaze that was common in modern-day Iraq from the ninth to the sixteenth century. A type of polychrome stoneware from the sixteenth century characterized by grey, green, and brown glazes may {{have been made in}} Persia or India as an attempted imitation of Chinese porcelain. Another type of partially grey glazed bowls with circular decorations on their interior is believed to come from Indochina since the disappearance of the style coincides with the Thai conquest of the region in AD 1467. Various types of Chinese pottery also appear at Gedi, including celadon and <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> porcelain, which were found in large enough volumes to assume that {{a significant portion of the}} population had access to higher quality wares, while sherds were also found inlayed in the mosques.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} century, celadon was a prized import in East Africa, which was {{initially}} {{obtained from the}} Ming Dynasty in exchange for ivory. However, knowledge of direct exchange with the Chinese is restricted to a single account of a Chinese fleet harbored off of Malindi and Mombasa between 1417 and 1419. The number of imports from China and elsewhere continued to increase throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, represented by {{a large number of}} black on yellow Islamic wares and celadon. Also during the fourteenth century, local wares began to diversify with Gedi's expanding economy. During {{the beginning and end of}} the fifteenth century, respectively, <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> porcelain began to gradually replace celadon and monochrome Islamic wares completely replaced black on yellow types. During the same century, local wares began to change with the reduction in the number of incised ornamental patterns and a shift to long necked-pots, compared to earlier short-necked variants. In the following century, <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> porcelain and monochrome Islamic wares became the dominant imports; a trend that began to emerge in the previous century and would continue until Gedi's decline in the seventeenth century.|$|E

5|$|Stockport County Football Club is a semi-professional {{football}} club in Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. Formed in 1883 as Heaton Norris Rovers, the team adopted their name in 1890 after the County Borough of Stockport. They have played at Edgeley Park since 1902, traditionally in <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> and are nicknamed The Hatters after the town's former hat-making industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{current flag}} design {{represents}} {{a dramatic change}} {{in the evolution of the}} Portuguese standard, which had always been closely associated with the royal arms, <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>white.</b> Since the country's foundation, the national flag developed from the bluecross-on-white armorial square banner of King Afonso I to the liberal monarchy's arms over a blue-and-white rectangle. In between, major changes associated with determinant political events contributed to its evolution into the current design.|$|E
5|$|The team {{began playing}} in black shirts {{with a yellow}} sash from their {{foundation}} in 1883 as Black Arabs F.C. until 1885, by which time they were called Eastville Rovers.
