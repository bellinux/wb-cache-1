5000|$|Tourists often venture {{further up}} the West Coast north of Westport. Originally {{there was a}} narrow, steep and winding road to the township, but the steeper section of road has been closed and diverted, going {{directly}} to Stockton via 'The Grand Canyon'. Access is now off the new upper road section & is signposted, entering the township via the original road from the North-eastern end of the town. This 'old' road continues through the town and west towards the historic Millerton Incline, the Portal and Dam (part of an inclined rail system that took coal down to Granity). There are some spectacular views here across the rainforest to the coast and north towards the Karamea headland. The closed section of old road can be walked down {{as far as the}} Millerton 'Granity Creek' Bridge. Where there are a series of spectacular waterfalls to be viewed. There is parking at either end of this walking section. The local community offers maps and information at the local community hall (in the township). There are several short walks in and around Millerton with historic sites and scenic views. The Bathhouse walks are a hidden gem in this area, and the Bathhouses themselves are of historic value too. A creek formed the reservoir dam where the coal miners used to come and bathe after a long day mining, and remnants of the pipework which flowed with hot water heated by the mines still remains at the site. In the township area you can see the mine sites and also the incline <b>brake</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of in-plane vibration of a noisy disc brake is problematic {{because it is}} difficult both to measure and to verify. Because of the disc structure and the inability to visualize disc in-plane vibration, there has been reluctance by researchers to accept the contribution of a displacement parallel {{to the surface of}} the object, or in-plane displacement, to noise generation. In addition to measuring absolute displacement, it has been difficult to isolate the in-plane and out-of-plane components of displacement using either non-contact or conventional displacement measurement techniques. This paper investigates absolute displacement of a brake disc during noise generation. Double-pulsed holographic interferometry is used to record a series of time-related images of the <b>brake</b> <b>head</b> from three different angles of observation. Because each image views the <b>brake</b> <b>head</b> from a different perspective, each of them records a different degree of in-plane and out-of-plane displacement. By careful analysis of the three images, it is possible to isolate the in-plane displacement from the out-of-plane displacement. The time-related series allows the displacement to be investigated over a full cycle of excitation and so create an animation of the mode of vibration. It is seen that the in-plane displacement is complex and that its amplitude may be about twice that of the out-of-plane displacement...|$|E

40|$|SummaryA {{prominent}} hypothesis {{in motor}} control is that endpoint errors are minimized because motor commands are updated {{in real time}} via internal feedback loops. We investigated in monkey whether orienting saccadic gaze shifts made in the dark with coordinated eye-head movements are controlled by feedback. We recorded from superior colliculus fixation neurons (SCFNs) that fired tonically during fixation and were silent during gaze shifts. When we briefly (â‰¤ 700 ms) interrupted gaze shifts by transiently <b>braking</b> <b>head</b> movements, SCFNs fired steadily during brake-induced gaze immobility, and their mean frequency was inversely related to the remaining distance between current gaze position and the target. After head release, a corrective gaze saccade brought gaze on the unseen goal, and SCFN firing frequency peaked. The results support gaze feedback control and show that the SC {{is part of a}} network that encodes, during orientation, the distance between eye and target, irrespective of gaze trajectory characteristics...|$|R

However, HÃ¼lkenberg was demoted five positions on the grid after the Williams team changed his gearbox after the race at Monza. As a consequence, Petrov inherited 12th position having pushed hard {{on a set of}} option tyres. He had lost control of his car after he went deep, under <b>braking,</b> <b>heading</b> for turn five (a corner that was damp from the earlier rain shower), with his right-rear wheel hitting the wall. Petrov's crash meant he took no further part in qualifying. He was ahead of Buemi, in the slower of the two Torro Rossos, who lost a large amount of grip and got stuck in traffic. Heidfeld took 14th ahead of his fellow countryman Sutil in 15th. Liuzzi had a problem with his front brakes on the first run of the second session and managed 16th. Timo Glock, Heikki Kovalainen and Lucas di Grassi were the quickest drivers unable to advance beyond the first part of qualifying. The eleventh row of the grid was filled by Jarno Trulli and Klien. Senna took 23rd. Massa was unable to set a timed lap as his gearbox seized without warning forcing him to stop on the circuit; Ferrari chose to replace his engine and gearbox as a precaution.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the interaction of}} smooth ocular pursuit (SP) and the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) during horizontal, combined eye-head tracking (CEHT) in patients with abnormalities of either the VOR or SP movements. Our strategy was to apply transient stimuli that capitalized on the different latencies to onset of SP and the VOR. During CEHT of a target moving at 15 deg/sec, normal subjects and patients with VOR deficits all tracked the target with a gain close to 1. O. When the heads of normal subjects were suddenly and unexpectedly braked to a halt during CEHT, the eye promptly began {{to move in the}} orbit to track the target, but eye-in-orbit velocity transiently fell to about 60 - 70 % of target velocity. In patients with deficient labyrinthine function, following the onset of the <b>head</b> <b>brake,</b> eye movements to track the target were absent, and SP movements were not generated until about 100 msec later. In patients with deficient SP, CEHT was superior to SP tracking with the head stationary; after the onset of the <b>head</b> <b>brake,</b> tracking eye movements were initiated promptly, but eye velocity was less than 50 % of target velocity and increased only slightly thereafter. These results indicate that at least two mechanisms operate to overcome the VOR and allow gaze to track the target during CEHT: (1) the SP system provides a signal to cancel a normally-operating VOR (this cancellation signal is not needed by labyrinthine-deficient patients who have no VOR to cancel), and (2) a reduction of the gain of the VOR is achieved, an ability that is preserved even in patients with cerebral lesions that impair SP...|$|R

Sponsored by wireless company Alltel, Johnson would finish 10th in the points and place third in the 2000 Rookie of the Year points, behind Ron Hornaday and Kevin Harvick. Johnson's rookie year was notable for a crash at Watkins Glen International, where his <b>brakes</b> failed <b>heading</b> into turn 1 and he slammed the barrier head on. He was not injured and even pumped his fists after exiting the car. After Alltel left for Penske Racing, Johnson remained with the team for 2001, sponsored by Excedrin. Johnson gave the team its first ever win at the inaugural race at Chicagoland Speedway. Herzog's plans were to field a Cup team with Johnson, but he had already signed a deal with Hendrick Motorsports for 2002. Herzog then turned to Todd Bodine. Bodine would take the team's second win at Kentucky Speedway and finished 23rd in points. After Excedrin's departure, Herzog Motorsports joined with former baseball player Reggie Jackson to form Herzog-Jackson Motorsports in 2003. With Bodine back at the wheel, the team took its third and final victory at Darlington Raceway. Despite the added presence of fame, the team had sponsors for a few races, but could not attract a major sponsor to pay the bills, despite Bodine leading the points. Troubles were evident when the team skipped the Chicago race and Bodine was released. HJM returned at Kansas with Jeff Green, who finished 11th.

With the help of these periodic BSM advertisements and flooding throughout the VANET, every vehicle can construct a traffic awareness from a very large area and take preventive actions {{before it is too late}} to avoid collisions. The details of traffic safety mechanisms in VANETs and their special network protocol stack design can be found in VANET standards.

5000|$|Non-synchronous {{transmissions}} are engineered {{with the}} understanding that a trained operator will be shifting gears in a known coordination of timing. Commercial vehicle operators use a double-clutching technique that is taught in driver's trade schools. The most skillful drivers can shift these transmissions without using the clutch by bringing the engine to exactly the right rpm in neutral before attempting to complete a shift, a technique called [...] "float-shifting." [...] With payloads of cargo ranging in commercial freight of 80,000 lbs (40 tons (short) or 36.3 tonnes) or more, some heavy haulers have over 24 â€³gearsâ€³ (i.e., combinations of gear ratios) that an operator will shift through before reaching a top cruising speed of 70 mph (113 km/h). Many low-low (creeper) gears are used in farm equipment to plow, till, or harvest. Also see Engineering vehicle. An inexperienced operator could suddenly find a piece of heavy equipment stuck in the wrong gear under full power, or even worse unable to shift a runaway vehicle from neutral into a gear for <b>braking</b> effect when <b>headed</b> down a steep slope, unless he or she possessed the synchronizing skill and understood torque issues in non-synchronous transmissions. Many mountain roads require heavy equipment operators to remain in gear and not shift while operating down a steep grade. For more details about steep grade operation see either jake brake, or engine brake. Many other circumstances face operators of non-synchronous transmissions. Safety and operator skills need to be learned before operating any of these types of vehicles.|$|R

Previous studies have reported that driving in a simulator, compared to on-road driving, can alter braking responses while stopping at intersections. Here we evaluated whether altered braking responses observed in fixed-base simulators could be linked to the presence of sickness symptoms in older drivers. Older individuals participated in a 5 -session training study that included a pre-test, three training sessions and a post-test. We evaluated adaptation to simulator sickness through repeated exposure (5 simulator sessions). Furthermore, we assessed whether head postural instability accounted for the presence of sickness symptoms. Sickness symptoms were measured with the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). After the first session, half of the participants reported mild symptoms (MS, VAS score> 5), and another half reported light symptoms (LS, VAS score< 5). We compared sickness symptoms, <b>braking</b> responses and <b>head</b> postural stability between the two groups for the first (pre-test) and last (post-test) driving sessions. During the pre-test, participants of the MS group braked earlier, showed longer time of deceleration, a greater number of pedal activations and showed increased irregularities in their deceleration profile. Participants from the MS group adapted in that, sickness symptoms reduced through exposure. During the post-test, we observed a larger decrease in variability for the MS than the LS group, but we did not find any difference regarding the braking responses per se or the head postural stability. We interpreted these results as evidence that adaptation is accompanied with a reduction of variability. Finally, we propose that a more gradual exposure to simulated environment might be required before evaluating the driving performance of individuals prone to simulator sickness...|$|R
40|$|Aluminum-silicon alloys are notable {{materials}} {{owing to}} their fine thermal conductivity, low expansion coefficient and good corrosion {{that can be}} utilized {{in the fields of}} automotive industry such as cylinder blocks, cylinder <b>heads,</b> <b>brake</b> discs, pistons and valve lifters. Modification of melt treatment in Al-Si cast alloys leads to a change in the morphology of eutectic silicon, resulting in mechanical properties enhancement. This enhancement affects the machinability of Al-Si alloys (i. e. cutting forces, surface roughness, tool wear and chip morphology). Near-eutectic alloys are the most difficult to machine of the various Al-Si alloys because, the silicon phase present is almost ten times harder than the aluminum base alloy, which rapidly increases tool wear, these difficulties have thus created the need for a more in-depth understanding of the effects of microstructure on the machinability of these alloys. Compared with other techniques, melt treatment with addition of inoculation agents known as modifier or refiner elements is more practical method due to low production cost and suitability for general engineering applications. Despite previous studies on microstructure of Al-Si alloys, there is lack of information on the effect of Bi, Sb and Sr additions that extensively address the influence of these elements on machinability characteristics of Al- 11 Si- 2 Cu cast alloy when dry turning. Understanding the machinability of these alloys is imperative when it is necessary to fabricate some industrial products which are produced by casting process. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the machinability characteristics of Al- 11 Si 2 Cu alloy containing bismuth, antimony and strontium when dry turning using coated carbide inserts. The influence of additional elements on mechanical properties was also investigated by conducting hardness, tensile and impact tests. iv Machining of workpieces was completed using a CNC turning machine (ALPHA 1350 S) with an 8. 3 kW power drive.
