50|$|This type is superficially {{very similar}} to a {{resonance}} absorption isolator, but the magnetic biassing differs, and the energy from the backward travelling signal is absorbed in a resistive film or card on one face of the ferrite block rather than within the ferrite itself. The bias field is weaker than that necessary to cause resonance at the operating frequency, but is instead designed to give the ferrite zero permeability for one sense of rotation of the microwave signal field. The bias polarity is such that this special condition arises for the forward signal, while the <b>backward</b> <b>signal</b> sees the ferrite as an ordinary permeable material. Consequently, the electromagnetic field of the forward signal tends to be excluded from the ferrite while the field of the backward wave is concentrated within it. This results in a null of the electric field of the forward signal {{on the surface of}} the ferrite where the resistive film is placed. Conversely for the <b>backward</b> <b>signal,</b> the electric field is strong over this surface and so its energy is dissipated in driving current through the film. In rectangular waveguide the ferrite block will typically occupy the full height from one broad-wall to the other, with the resistive film on the side facing the centre-line of the guide.|$|E

40|$|International audienceParametric downconversion in {{submicronic}} periodically poled (PP) quadratic materials {{allows for}} the generation of signal and idler waves in opposite directions. The distributed feedback mechanism enables a backward mirrorless optical parametric oscillator (BMOPO), which has been experimentally realized using a periodically poled KTiOPO(PPKTP) crystal with 800 nm periodicity. A remarkable spectral property of the BMOPO is that the bandwidth of the forward co-propagating wave {{is comparable to the}} pump bandwidth, whereas that of the backward wave is typically several orders of magnitude narrower. In the backward idler configuration realized in PPKTP the backward idler exhibits a coherence gain of two orders of magnitude. In this paper we will consider the <b>backward</b> <b>signal</b> configuration, where the effect of coherence enhancement of the <b>backward</b> <b>signal</b> wave is especially pronounced for exact group velocity matching of the co-propagating pump and idler waves. Thisquasi-phase-matched (QPM) scheme requires a 335 nm scale poling periodicity which may be achieved in GaN waveguides, combining e-beam lithography and epitaxy. However, during the lithography step necessary to obtain the PP material, stitching faults may occur. The BMOPO device is then formed by a sequence of 200 microns long PP elements stuck together. We assume that the stitching faults do not exceed half of the poling period in order to prevent the parametric reverse process. The original three-wave QPM model with the explicit periodicity of the nonlinear parametric coupling is necessary for taking into account the periodicity faults in the junctions. Thanks to the High Performance Computing facility available at Nice University, we analyse the parametric downconversion efficiency and the coherence gain of the <b>backward</b> <b>signal</b> versus the stochastic pump bandwidth in a large pump bandwidth range. We show that if the stitching faults do not exceed a quarter of the poling period, i. e. less than 80 nm, which is technically feasible, the efficiency is comparable to the BMOPO in the perfect PP material. In any case, for an incoherent pump of broad spectral bandwidth we obtain a coherence gain of almost three orders of magnitude...|$|E

We study these solitary {{waves in the}} particular case of a doubly backward quasiphase matching configuration. The same mechanism responsible for nanosecond solitary wave morphogenesis in the c. w. pumped Brillouin-fiber-ring laser may act for picosecond pulse generation in a quadratic c. w. pumped optical parametric oscillator (OPO).

We speculate that the parieto-premotor network, which includes the mirror neuron system, is key for mapping one's own body and the bodies of others. This means that the neuronal substrates that control one's own action and the mirror neuron system are shared with the “who” system, which is related to the recognition of action contribution, i. e., sense of agency.

Using 20 -μm-thick tissue slices, the ratio of forward to backward SHG signal from large bundles was found to be much larger than that from small single fibrils, indicating a phase-matching effect in coherent microscopy. Based on the intensity profiles across fibrils and the size dependence of forward and <b>backward</b> <b>signal</b> from the same fibril, we concluded that the main SHG signal directly originates from the fibrils, but not from surface SHG effects.

Before the monkeys learned the task, the anterior commissure was transected, disconnecting the anterior temporal cortex of each hemisphere. After training with 12 pairs of pictures, single units were recorded from the inferotemporal cortex of the monkeys as the control. By injecting a grid of ibotenic acid, we unilaterally lesioned the entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, which provides massive direct and indirect backward projections ipsilaterally to the inferotemporal cortex. After the lesion, the monkeys fixated the cue stimulus normally, relearned the preoperatively learned set (set A), and learned a new set (set B) of paired associates. Then, single units were recorded from the same area as for the prelesion control.

THG imaging reveals the tissue morphology, including the epithelium structure with sub-cellular resolution. Polarization-resolved THG microscopy reveals stromal birefringent domains. In phenol-stained corneas, THG also reveals the keratocytes network. SHG imaging probes the distribution of stromal collagen lamellas organization. 2 PEF imaging reveals the elastic component of the extra-cellular matrix {{and the distribution of}} fluorescent organelles (i. e. mitochondria) in stromal and epithelial cells.

40|$|Three-wave solitons {{backward}} propagating {{with respect}} to a pump wave are generated in nonlinear optical media through stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in optical fibers or through the non-degenerate three-wave interaction in quadratic (χ (2)) nonlinear media. In an optical fiber-ring cavity, nanosecond solitary wave morphogenesis takes place when it is pumped with a continuous wave (c. w.). A backward dissipative Stokes soliton is generated from the hypersound waves stimulated by electrostriction between the forward pump wave and the counterpropagating Stokes wave. Superluminous and subluminous dissipative solitons are controlled via a single parameter: the feedback or reinjection for a given pump intensity or the pump intensity for a given feedback. In a c. w. pumped optical parametric oscillator (OPO), backward picosecond soliton generation takes place for non-degenerate three-wave interaction in the quadratic medium. The resonant condition is automatically satisfied in stimulated Brillouin backscattering when the fiber-ring laser contains a large number of longitudinal modes beneath the Brillouin gain curve. However, in order to achieve quasi-phase matching between the three optical waves (the forward pump wave and the <b>backward</b> <b>signal</b> and idler waves) in the χ (2) medium, the nonlinear susceptibility should be periodically structurated by an inversion grating of sub-μm period in an optical parametric oscillator (OPO).

40|$|The need {{to exploit}} the large fibre {{bandwidth}} and increase the reach has seen {{the application of the}} Raman fibre amplifier (RFA) become indispensable in modern light wave systems. The success and resilience of RFAs in optical communication is deeply rooted in their unique optical properties and new technologies which have allowed the amplifier to come of age. However, the full potential of RFAs in optical communication and other applications are yet to be realized. More so are its polarization properties which still remain largely unexploited and have not been fully understood. In this work, fundamental issues regarding distributed RFA have been investigated with the aim of acquiring {{a better understanding of the}} amplifier polarization characteristics which have potential applications. In particular the effects of polarization mode dispersion (PMD) and polarization dependent loss (PDL) have been demonstrated both by simulation and experiment. The possibility of Raman polarization pulling in single mode fibres (SMFs) has also been addressed. Polarization sensitivity of RFA has been known for a long time but the clear manifestation of it has become evident in the advent of modern low PMD fibre. Unlike EDFAs which make use of special doped fibre, RFAs require no special fibre for operation. Besides, RFA uses a very long length of fibre and as such the fibre polarization characteristics come into play during amplification. In the demonstrations presented in this thesis a fibre of PMD coefficient < 0. 05 pskm- 1 / 2 was regarded as low PMD fibre while one having coefficient ≥ 0. 05 pskm- 1 / 2 was categorized to have high PMD unless otherwise stated. Several experiments were performed to evaluate the RFA gain characteristics with respect to fibre PMD and the system performance in the presence of noise emanating from amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). Analysis of Raman gain statistics was done for fibres of low and high PMD coefficients. The statistics of PDG and on-off gain were eventually used to demonstrate the extraction of PMD coefficients of fibres between 0. 01 - 0. 1 pskm- 1 / 2 using a forward pumping configuration. It was found that, at increasing pump power a linear relationship exists between forward and <b>backward</b> <b>signal</b> gain on a dB scale. The interaction of PDL and Raman PDG in the presence of PMD were observed at very fundamental level. It was found the presence of PDL serves to reduce the available on-off gain. It was also established that the presence of PMD mediates the interaction between PDG/PDL. When PMD is high it reduces PDG but the presence of PDL introduces a wavelength dependent gain tilting for WDM channels.

50|$|Second-harmonic imaging {{microscopy}} (SHIM) {{is based}} on a nonlinear optical effect known as second-harmonic generation (SHG). SHIM has been established as a viable microscope imaging contrast mechanism for visualization of cell and tissue structure and function. A second-harmonic microscope obtains contrasts from variations in a specimen’s ability to generate second-harmonic light from the incident light while a conventional optical microscope obtains its contrast by detecting variations in optical density, path length, or refractive index of the specimen. SHG requires intense laser light passing through a material with a noncentrosymmetric molecular structure. Second-harmonic light emerging from an SHG material is exactly half the wavelength (frequency doubled) of the light entering the material. While two-photon-excited fluorescence (TPEF) is also a two photon process, TPEF loses some energy during the relaxation of the excited state, while SHG is energy conserving. Typically, an inorganic crystal is used to produce SHG light such as lithium niobate (LiNbO3), potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP = KTiOPO4), and lithium triborate (LBO = LiB3O5). Though SHG requires a material to have specific molecular orientation in order for the incident light to be frequency doubled, some biological materials can be highly polarizable, and assemble into fairly ordered, large noncentrosymmetric structures. Biological materials such as collagen, microtubules, and muscle myosin can produce SHG signals. The SHG pattern is mainly determined by the phase matching condition. A common setup for an SHG imaging system will have a laser scanning microscope with a titanium sapphire mode-locked laser as the excitation source. The SHG signal is propagated in the forward direction. However, some experiments have shown that objects on the order of about a tenth of the wavelength of the SHG produced signal will produce nearly equal forward and <b>backward</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R

It is shown that the forward and the <b>backward</b> error <b>signal</b> vectors appearing in a 2 -channel lattice filter implementation are coupled via a 2 -channel allpass filter. This latter finding can be used as the basis for an alternative proof of the stability of the synthesis system...|$|R
50|$|A gyrator is {{an entirely}} non-reciprocal device, and hence is {{represented}} by antisymmetric impedance and admittance matrices:If the gyration resistance is chosen to be equal to the characteristic impedance of the two ports (or to their geometric mean if {{these are not the}} same), then the scattering matrix for the gyrator iswhich is likewise antisymmetric. This leads to an alternative definition of a gyrator: a device which transmits a signal unchanged in the forward (arrow) direction, but reverses the polarity of the signal travelling in the backward direction (or equivalently, 180° phase-shifts the <b>backward</b> travelling <b>signal).</b> The symbol used to represent a gyrator in one-line diagrams (where a waveguide or transmission line is shown as a single line rather than as a pair of conductors), reflects this one-way phase shift.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel scheme to {{simultaneously}} detect coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy signals {{in the forward}} (F) and backward (epi-E) direction with a single avalanche photodiode (APD) detector using time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC). By installing a mirror at a well-defined distance above the sample the forward-scattered F-CARS signal is reflected back into the microscope objective leading to spatial overlap of the F and E-CARS signals. Due to traveling an additional distance the F-CARS signal is time delayed relative to the E-CARS signal. TCSPC then allows for the two signals to be resolved in the time domain. This results in an efficient, simple, and compact method of CARS signal detection. We demonstrate this technique by analyzing forward and <b>backward</b> CARS <b>signals</b> obtained by imaging living adipocyte cells derived from human mesenchymal stem cells.

40|$|We {{performed}} dye-enhanced imaging of mouse brain microvessels using spectral focusing coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (SF-CARS) microscopy. The resonant {{signals from}} C-H stretching in forward CARS usually show high background intensity in tissues, which makes CARS imaging of microvessels difficult. In this study, epi-detection of back-scattered SF-CARS signals showed a negligible background, {{but the overall}} intensity of resonant CARS signals was too low to observe the network of brain microvessels. Therefore, Evans blue (EB) dye was used as contrasting agent to enhance the back-scattered SF-CARS signals. Breakdown of brain microvessels by inducing hemorrhage in a mouse was clearly visualized using <b>backward</b> SF-CARS <b>signals,</b> following intravenous injection of EB. The improved visualization of brain microvessels with EB enhanced the sensitivity of SF-CARS, detecting not only the blood vessels themselves but their integrity {{as well in the}} brain vasculature...|$|R
40|$|Interactions of CD 70, a tumor {{necrosis}} factor-related cell surface ligand and its receptor, CD 27, {{are thought}} {{to play an important}} role for T-, B-, and natural killer-cell activation. However, ligation of CD 27 can also induce apoptosis. Human glioblastoma is paradigmatic for cancer-associated immunosuppression. We identified CD 70 as a radioinducible gene in U 87 MG glioma cells. A screening of a panel of human glioma cell lines revealed that 11 of 12 cell lines expressed CD 70 mRNA and protein. Two human neuroblastoma cell lines did not express CD 70. CD 70 mRNA expression was enhanced by irradiation in 8 of 12 glioma cell lines in a p 53 -independent manner. No alteration in CD 70 expression was observed after glioma cell exposure to cytotoxic drugs such as lomustine. CD 70 protein was also detected by immunocytochemistry in 5 of 12 glioblastomas and 3 of 4 anaplastic astrocytomas in vivo. CD 27 expression was not detected in any glioma cell line, and there was no evidence for autocrine or <b>backward</b> <b>signaling</b> of the CD 70 system in human glioma cells. Unexpectedly, CD 70 expressed on glioma cells did not increase the immunogenicity of glioma cells in vitro. In contrast, CD 70 -positive glioma cells induced apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a CD 70 -dependent manner. Neutralization of CD 70 expressed on glioma cells prevented apoptosis and enhanced the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in cocultures of glioma cells and PBMCs. The effects of CD 70 -expressing glioma cells on PBMCs were mimicked by agonistic CD 27 antibodies. Conversely, the shedding of CD 27 by PBMCs was identified as a possible escape mechanism from glioma cell-induced CD 70 -dependent apoptosis. Thus, induction of B-cell and T-cell apoptosis via interactions of CD 70 expressed on glioma cells and CD 27 expressed on B and T cells may be a novel way for the immune escape of malignant gliomas...|$|R
40|$|Physicians in {{clinical}} settings are constantly seeking label-free imaging modalities with superior sensitivity and resolution. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) has demonstrated great clinical potential, but complicated optics and poor conversion efficiency of CARS signal photons has limited {{the use of}} endoscopic CARS. Optimization of optical systems for maximal signal collection for rapid, low noise endoscopic imaging is essential. In vivo CARS imaging collects a large backscattered signal from forward CARS, obscuring structures with dimensions similar to the excitation wavelength. This is the first model to accurately {{determine the effect of}} scattering in multiple tissue types on CARS imaging. By characterizing the radial location of the <b>backward</b> CARS <b>signal</b> from sub-wavelength features and backscattered forward CARS signals from larger scatterers, methods are developed to collect both images simultaneously. Numerical methods are utilized to demonstrate how the focusing objective, focal depth, collection method, and object of interest impact CARS imaging...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedWe {{are living}} in a world that has {{constant}} demands for increasing communication channel throughput as new applications emerge every day. However, spectrum as a limited resource, cannot be allocated to new applications. On the other hand, existing applications are not utilizing the allocated bands to their maximum throughput. Naturally reusing the spectrum used by existing applications is considered. Since the existing applications cannot be disturbed in most of the cases, the reuse of the spectrum must be backward compatible with existing systems.; In this thesis, a <b>backward</b> compatible <b>signal</b> design technique for throughput improvement has been proposed. This technique exploits excessive Signal-to-Noise-Ratio in existing systems, and can improve system throughput at modest to high SNR. Signal model, potential improvement in throughput in terms of channel cutoff rate, and optimal receivers have been developed. It has been shown that in some cases, channel cutoff rate can be improved by 60 %...|$|R
