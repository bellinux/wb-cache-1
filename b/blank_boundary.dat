Originally the sensitivity method has successfully been applied to several arbitrary shapes. In the present paper the sensitivity coefficients are not considered constant during the analysis. The presented approach computes the new coefficients from the two last iterations. This method can produce an initial <b>blank</b> <b>boundary</b> shape that has any arbitrary flange shape. A cup with uniform flange has been studied in detail and results show a faster solution convergence than the published sensitivity method. Experimental tests were conducted to compare with the numerical simulations. The optimum blank shape obtained from the numerical simulations was used during the experimental trials. The results of experimental tests for both square and optimum blank are presented here. Index Terms — Finite element method, modified sensitivity analysis, optimum blank, sheet metal forming. mapping [6, 7], the {{trial and error method}} based on the FE simulations [8, 9], inverse method [10] which uses FE analysis for the direct prediction of the blank shapes and the strain distributions in the desired final shape, the backward tracing method [11] in which the key concept is to trace plastic deformation in backward direction from final desirable configuration to initial blank shape and intermediate deformed shapes. In this study a modification for initial blank design in sheet forming has been developed and proven in its effectiveness by the application of square cup stamping process. In the blank design of square cup stamping, the modified sensitivity program can produce a net-shape cup with straight edges with lower iterations. Finally the deformation with optimum blank is analyzed and its effects on thickness change (thinning distribution) and punch force are investigated. I...|$|E
40|$|We have {{proposed}} that visual narratives in comics are organized with a hierarchic narrative “grammar. ” Inspired by classic “click ” studies of syntax, we inserted blank “disruption ” panels Before, At, or After the constituent boundaries of comic strips. In self-paced viewing, Experiment 1 found that <b>blanks</b> After the <b>boundary</b> were viewed slower than Before or At the boundary. Panels immediately following blanks were slower than corresponding panels in sequences without blank panels, but only when placed Before or After the boundary. Three ordinal panel positions following the <b>boundary,</b> panels following <b>blanks</b> At the <b>boundary</b> or with No-Blanks were viewed faster than panels following blanks After or Before the boundary. This supports constituency because disruptions had greater impact within, as opposed to between, constituents. Using ERPs, Experiment 2 found a larger anterior negativity to blanks within constituents (Before/After) than between constituents (At). This indicates disruptions of constituents are recognized before reaching a subsequent panel. A larger P 600 appeared to <b>blanks</b> After the <b>boundary</b> than in the first constituent (Before/At). This positivity may reflect a reanalysis reflecting the inability to integrate all prior panels into a single constituent, since they are divided by the constituent boundary...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{mathematical}} model is presented by which the cutting forces in gear form milling process are predicted using the mechanistic approach. To use this approach, {{a detailed description of}} the chip geometry is needed. Eccentricity and run-out tool errors are considered, which is of great importance as the chip thickness will by these errors vary for the subsequent cuts. The chip geometry is determined by comparing the path of the cutting edge with already removed material. The boundary of the chips is determinable from the cutting edge geometry, which is here derived in parametric form so spur and helical gears are manufactured correctly. Locally on the cutting edge, the cutting forces are resolved from orthogonal cutting data and on the basis that these forces are proportional to the instantaneous chip thickness. The load each individual cutting tooth experience in operation, as well as the complete load on the tool, are resolved by summing the forces along the cutting edge. In the model, all cut chips are determined for each machined gear tooth gap, with the gear <b>blank</b> <b>boundaries</b> considered. The paper ends with experimental validation using indexable insert milling cutters. It is shown that the model predicts the force shape well and the peak force levels within 12 %...|$|R
40|$|Springback in {{multi-point}} dieless forming (MDF) is {{a common}} problem {{because of the small}} deformation and <b>blank</b> holder free <b>boundary</b> condition. Numerical simulations are widely used in sheet metal forming to predict the springback. However, the computational time in using the numerical tools is time costly to find the optimal process parameters value. This study proposes radial basis function (RBF) to replace the numerical simulation model by using statistical analyses that are based on a design of experiment (DOE). Punch holding time, blank thickness, and curvature radius are chosen as effective process parameters for determining the springback. The Latin hypercube DOE method facilitates statistical analyses and the extraction of a prediction model in the experimental process parameter domain. Finite element (FE) simulation model is conducted in the ABAQUS commercial software to generate the springback responses of the training and testing samples. The genetic algorithm is applied to find the optimal value for reducing and compensating the induced springback for the different blank thicknesses using the developed RBF prediction model. Finally, the RBF numerical result is verified by comparing with the FE simulation result of the optimal process parameters and both results show that the springback is almost negligible from the target shape...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{essential}} {{feature of}} a lexicon-grammar {{is that the}} elementary unit of computation and storage is the simple sentence: suject-verb-complement(s). This type of representation is obviously needed for verbs. We have applied lexicon-grammar representation {{not only to the}} two obvious predicative parts of speech, verb and adjective, but to nouns and adverbs as well. The process of accumulation that led to the formalized lexicon-grammar of 12, 000 French verbs has run into what seemed to be at first a minor problem of representation of words: the difference between simple and compound words. On the one hand, there are simple words such as the verb 'know' and complex (idiomatic) forms such as 'keep in mind'. Compound terns raise a problem of representation. The unit of representation in a linear lexicon is roughly the word as defined by its written form, that is, a sequence of letters separated from neighboring sequences by <b>boundary</b> <b>blanks.</b> As a consequence, compound words cannot be directly put into a dictionary the way simple words are. An identification procedure is needed for their occurrences in texts, and this procedure will make use of the various simple parts of the compound utterance. Hence, the formal linguistic properties of compound terms will determine both the procedure of identification in texts and the type of storage they require. We will discuss the main types of compounds and single out those properties that bear on automatic parsing and dictionary lookup. Preliminary figures have shown that compound terms form the essential part of a lexicon-grammar...|$|R
40|$|What distinguishes {{scenes from}} nonscenes? Photographs of objects on both naturalistic and <b>blank</b> {{backgrounds}} yielded <b>boundary</b> extension (BE: memory for unseen spatial expanse outside the picture’s boundaries). However, line-drawn objects on blank backgrounds did not (Experiment 1). Perhaps the blank background was construed as depicting a real-world {{surface in the}} photograph condition but was construed as depicting nothing in the line-drawn condition. To change background construal, the authors used objects cut out of photographs; these were placed on blank backgrounds while viewers watched (Experiments 2 and 3). BE was eliminated. The authors propose that amodal continuation is a funda-mental aspect of scene perception. However, not all pictures are scenes—only pictures construed as depicting a truncated view of a continuous world. In our interaction with the visual world, {{most of the information}} we process comes from complex visual scenes. These scenes typically include multiple objects and complex backgrounds. Our environment extends all around us, but physiological constraints prevent us from ever seeing an entire scene at once. Head move-ments and eye movements provide us with successive views of a continuous world. Yet, in spite of the complexity inherent in scenes, and the spatial limitations on how much of the world we can see at one time, our understanding of the visual environment seems effortless. In this study we focused on the viewer’s ability to remember how much of a scene was contained in a single view. We tested the hypothesis that when faced with a partial view of a continuous world, amodal continuation of scene layout plays a critical role in scene perception. Memory for spatial expanse was examined under conditions in which stimuli either were or were not understood to be scenes. Intraub and her colleagues showed that when remembering a photograph of a scene, viewers tended to remember having seen a greater spatial expanse than was actually shown—they referred to this error as boundary extension (Intraub & Richardson, 1989; se...|$|R
