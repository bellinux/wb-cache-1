40|$|A {{thermal model}} of railway tread braking is {{developed}} {{for use in}} routine calculations of wheel and brake block temperatures. Two-dimensional finite-element models of block(s) and wheel are coupled via a contact interface that controls the heat generation and also the heat partitioning between block and wheel through thermal contact resistances. The surface temperature variations around the wheel circumference as caused by frictional heating and intermediate cooling are accounted for in a mean sense, assuming high-speed sliding conditions. The thermal power generated at the block-wheel interface during braking is determined from train braking data. A model for heat transfer from the rolling wheel into the rail is developed where a film with thermal contact resistance is placed at the wheel-rail contact interface. The present model {{can be used to}} efficiently design tread braking systems for both freight and passenger trains. It can handle stop <b>braking,</b> <b>drag</b> braking at constant brake power, and also intermediate periods of cooling. The temperature history during a full train route can be calculated. The inclusion of heat transfer from wheel to rail means that the model is useful for comparing brake rig tests, where normally the chilling influence from the rail is not included, with in-field tests. Two companion papers with experimental results supplement the present numerical modelling. A brief numerical example demonstrates the heat partitioning and the influence of rail chill (about 30 per cent) for two braking configurations...|$|E
40|$|Block braking is a {{commonly}} used braking system for freight wagons {{and other types}} of railway vehicles. One or several brake blocks are pressed against the tread (running surface) of the wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The kinetic energy of the running train is then transformed into heat, which is partitioned between block(s) and wheel and is conducted from block to block holder and from wheel to rail and also dissipated into the surroundings by convection and radiation. During the last decade, one aspect of block braking has become an environmental issue: the high rolling noise levels generated by trains with block braked wheels. A roughness (corrugation, waviness) develops on the wheel tread during the sliding contact between block and wheel, and this tread roughness (out-of-roundness) induces vibrations and noise when the train rolls. The roughness level strongly depends on the properties of the brake block material. Here cast iron blocks generate higher roughness levels than do composite and sinter blocks. In Europe, cast iron is presently the most commonly used brake block material on freight wagons, but composite and sinter materials are now gradually being introduced. In {{the first part of the}} present thesis, the thermomechanical interaction between brake block and wheel tread is studied to search for the mechanisms behind the growth of wheel roughness. The evolution of hot spots, i e areas on the wheel tread with significantly higher temperature than the rest of the tread, is believed to be a key phenomenon that can explain the differences between the different block materials. Results from full-scale tread braking experiments with forged wheels in an inertia dynamometer are reported. A numerical model for studying the thermoelastic contact between brake block and wheel tread demonstrates the principal phenomena. Also, results from field measurements of wheel roughness are presented. The tendency of cast iron brake blocks to generate high roughness levels on wheel treads has propelled a general shift away from cast iron to other materials which do not give disturbing roughness levels. However, this change of block material will affect the heat partitioning between wheel and block. Excessive heating of the wheel may cause damage and may result in problems with axial deflection of the wheel rim (change of wheelset gauge). High tensile stresses in the wheel rim after its cooling down can lead to initiation and growth of transverse cracks in the wheel rim. In the second part of the present thesis, a thermal model of railway tread braking is developed for use in routine calculations of wheel and block temperatures, including the cooling influence from the rail. Brake rig tests have been performed for drag braking at constant brake power for blocks made of cast iron and sinter and composite materials. Results on the influence of block configuration, brake power and brake speed on wheel and block temperatures are reported. Rolling contact heat transfer from wheel to rail is studied in the brake rig using a so-called rail-wheel in contact with the braked wheel, along with results from field tests. The model has been calibrated by using data from the experiments and can be employed to calculate temperatures and the heat partitioning between block, wheel and rail. The rail chill is found to have a considerable influence on the wheel temperature for long brake cycles. The present model can be used to efficiently design tread braking systems for both freight and passenger trains. It can handle stop <b>braking,</b> <b>drag</b> braking at constant brake power, and also intermediate periods of cooling. The temperature history during a full train route can thus be calculated...|$|E
5000|$|While {{energy is}} always lost during a brake event, a {{secondary}} factor that influences efficiency is [...] "off-brake drag", or drag {{that occurs when}} the brake is not intentionally actuated.

2500|$|Mountain bike {{disc brakes}} may range from simple, {{mechanical}} (cable) systems, to expensive and powerful, multi-piston hydraulic disc systems, commonly used on downhill racing bikes. Improved technology {{has seen the}} creation of vented rotors for use on mountain bikes, similar to those on cars, introduced to help avoid heat fade on fast alpine descents. Although less common, discs are also used on road bicycles for all-weather cycling with predictable braking, although drums are sometimes preferred as harder to damage in crowded parking, where discs are sometimes bent. Most bicycle brake discs are made of steel. Stainless steel is preferred due to its anti-rust properties. Discs are thin, often about 2mm. Some use a two-piece floating disc style, others use a floating caliper, others use pads that float in the caliper, and some use one moving pad that makes the caliper slide on its mounts, pulling the other pad {{into contact with the}} disc. Because the [...] "motor" [...] is small, an uncommon feature of bicycle brakes is that the pads retract to eliminate residual <b>drag</b> when the <b>brake</b> is released.

50|$|A gravity racer obtains {{its energy}} solely {{from the force}} of gravity (assuming no {{starting}} push is permitted), which is effectively equal for any combination of racer design and course. However, performance can be greatly affected by the combined effects of various forms of drag and also the moment of inertia of the wheels, and also of course by the skill of the driver in choosing optimal lines. Drag breaks down into aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance. The latter can be minimised by careful attention to the wheel bearings, tyre sizes and pressures, and brakes (to avoid parasitic <b>brake</b> <b>drag).</b> High tyre pressures and narrower tyres will typically lower the tyre contact rolling resistance, usually at the expense of grip. Larger wheels have lower rolling resistance than small ones, and rolling resistance is also proportional to overall weight. If permitted, a 3-wheeler design will have 25% less rotational inertia than a 4-wheeler, all else being equal. Aerodynamic drag can be minimised by designing a fully enclosed body that reduces the drag coefficient, but given that this can be a highly technical thing to achieve especially for the amateur builder, and given that some aerodynamic drag is inevitable, a heavier cart will always do better than a lighter one with the same drag coefficient - its terminal velocity will be higher. For this reason there are usually class weight limits in most controlled forms of the sport. Since some of the potential energy due to gravity must be converted to the kinetic energy of the rotating wheels, a vehicle with lighter wheels will accelerate faster than one with heavier wheels. If a race is started on some form of ramp, having a tail-heavy car can also improve final acceleration, as the effective height of the centre of gravity of the vehicle is raised.|$|R
