These include the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (1994), Mac OS (1994), Atari Jaguar (1994), Acorn Archimedes (1994), 3DO (1995), Apple IIGS (1998), and PC-98 (1998). The Super NES and Jaguar ports {{were developed by}} id, while the rest were produced by other companies. Later releases include the Game Boy Advance (2002), Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and an iOS version programmed by Carmack himself (2009). These ports' sound, graphics, and levels sometimes differ from the original—the Super NES version notably replaced the blood with sweat, dogs with rats, and removed all Nazi references, although the core gameplay and aesthetic are retained. Many of the ports include only the Apogee episodes, but the iOS port includes Spear of Destiny, and a 2007 Steam release for PC, OS X, and Linux includes all of the FormGen episodes. Bethesda Softworks, whose parent company bought id Software in 2009, celebrated the 20th anniversary of Wolfenstein 3Ds release by producing a free-to-play <b>browser-based</b> version {{of the game in}} 2012.|$|E

25|$|Unlike in Selenium 1, {{where the}} Selenium server was {{necessary}} to run tests, Selenium WebDriver does not need a special server to execute tests. Instead, the WebDriver directly starts a browser instance and controls it. However, Selenium Grid {{can be used with}} WebDriver to execute tests on remote systems (see below). Where possible, WebDriver uses native operating system level functionality rather than <b>browser-based</b> JavaScript commands to drive the browser. This bypasses problems with subtle differences between native and JavaScript commands, including security restrictions.|$|E

A later clone of 1024, the fast-paced browser game 2048, became popular online and spawned [...] "dozens of parodies".

The Threes team was [...] "puzzled" [...] by the popularity of these releases, especially those that did not credit their game for the idea. They criticized 2048 game design and compared the game as the Commander Keen to their Super Mario Bros. in a 45,000-word post outlining their full 14-month development process. Gamasutra's Leigh Alexander described the situation as a [...] "unique tragedy". While Threes itself had a positive release, its success was tempered {{by the number of}} clones (with 2048, in particular) that shared the limelight. Threes designer Vollmer would try to remove the clones from online stores but ultimately accepted that the game would be copied and resolved that his future games would not share the same fate.|$|E
