5|$|All studies {{revealed}} minor {{improvements in}} household nutrient availability, with the 1985 study revealing an improvement of vitamin and mineral consumption over non-participating {{families and the}} 1993 study partially confirming these results. The most extensive study on nutrient availability was published in 1996, which concluded that nutrition did not change significantly after {{the implementation of the}} NAP program for all <b>beneficiaries,</b> however most improvements were noted for very low-income <b>beneficiaries</b> versus their non-participating equivalents.|$|E

50|$|The <b>beneficiary</b> {{receives}} policy proceeds {{upon the}} insured person's death. The owner designates the <b>beneficiary,</b> but the <b>beneficiary</b> {{is not a}} party to the policy. The owner can change the <b>beneficiary</b> unless the policy has an irrevocable <b>beneficiary</b> designation. If a policy has an irrevocable <b>beneficiary,</b> any <b>beneficiary</b> changes, policy assignments, or cash value borrowing would require the agreement of the original <b>beneficiary.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{information on}} the <b>beneficiary</b> was usually recorded in the diploma: <b>beneficiary's</b> regiment, regimental commander's name, <b>beneficiary's</b> military rank, name of <b>beneficiary,</b> name of <b>beneficiary's</b> father and origin (nation, tribe or city); name of <b>beneficiary's</b> wife and name of her father and origin; and names of children granted citizenship.|$|R
50|$|Contingent beneficiary: If {{the primary}} <b>beneficiary</b> predeceases the IRA owner, the {{contingent}} <b>beneficiary</b> becomes the designated <b>beneficiary.</b> If a contingent <b>beneficiary</b> is not named, the default {{provision in the}} custodian-agreement applies.|$|R

5|$|Such trusts will be invalid {{in several}} circumstances; {{charitable}} trusts {{are not allowed}} to be run for profit, nor can they have purposes that are not charitable (unless these are ancillary to the charitable purpose). In addition, it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or legal change, although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable. Charitable trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is no relationship between the trustees and the <b>beneficiaries.</b> This results in two things; firstly, the trustees of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other trustees and secondly, <b>beneficiaries</b> cannot bring a court case against the trustees. Rather, the <b>beneficiaries</b> are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a parens patriae, who appears on the part of The Crown.|$|E

50|$|When the {{probate court}} determines that the {{doctrine}} applies to a lifetime gift {{made to a}} will <b>beneficiary,</b> the amount <b>beneficiary's</b> gift under the will is reduced by the amount the <b>beneficiary</b> has already received. For example, if the will bequeaths $5,000 to a <b>beneficiary,</b> but the <b>beneficiary</b> received a lifetime gift of $4,000 from testator that was intended to partially satisfy the gift under the will, the <b>beneficiary</b> will receive only $1,000 under the will. If the will provides that the <b>beneficiary</b> receives {{a percentage of the}} testator's estate, the court may engage in a hotchpot calculation to determine the amount, if any, that the <b>beneficiary</b> should receive under the will. If the value of the lifetime gift received is greater than the <b>beneficiary's</b> calculated share under the will, the <b>beneficiary</b> receives nothing under the will, but does not return any of the lifetime gifts.|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} a third party <b>beneficiary</b> to have any rights under the contract, he must be an {{intended}} <b>beneficiary,</b> {{as opposed to an}} incidental <b>beneficiary.</b> The burden is on the third party to plead and prove that he was indeed an intended <b>beneficiary.</b>|$|R

5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{advantages}} to charity status. Within English trusts law, a standard express trust has a relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries; this does not apply to charitable trusts, partially because of the special definition of trustee used and partially because there are no individual <b>beneficiaries</b> identified in a charitable trust. Instead, the Attorney General of England and Wales sues on behalf of <b>beneficiaries</b> to enforce a charitable trust. Because of this lack of a relationship, the trustees' powers are far wider-ranging, only being regulated by the Charity Commission and actions brought by the Attorney General; the <b>beneficiaries</b> have no direct control. Charitable trusts are also exempt from many formalities when being created, including the rule against perpetuities. The trustees are also not required to act unanimously, only with a majority.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008 President Fernández de Kirchner nationalised private {{pension funds}} for almost $30 billion, ostensibly {{to protect the}} {{pensions}} from falling stock prices around the world, although critics said the government simply wanted to add the money to its budget. Private pension funds, which were first licensed in 1994, suffered large losses during the 19982002 crisis and by 2008, the state subsidized 77% of the funds' <b>beneficiaries.</b>|$|E
50|$|Substitution, {{in other}} words, {{occurs when a}} {{testator}} appoints a <b>beneficiary</b> to inherit a benefit, {{but at the same}} time nominates another <b>beneficiary</b> to take the place of the appointed <b>beneficiary</b> (legatee or heir) upon the occurrence of an event, usually the death of the appointed <b>beneficiary.</b>|$|R
40|$|The study {{examined}} the impact of Fadama III project on the food security status of <b>beneficiary</b> and non <b>beneficiary</b> farmers in Kabba/Bunu LGA of Kogi state, Nigeria. A two stage sampling technique was used to select 5 villages out of the 15 villages {{in the area and}} 18 <b>beneficiary</b> and non <b>beneficiary</b> farmers from each village giving a total o 180 respondents. Generated data were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis, logistic regressions, food security index (FSI), food insecurity gap (FIG), headcount ratio (HCR) and surplus index (SI). Analysis of the socioeconomic variables revealed that most of the <b>beneficiary</b> farmers are within the age of 40 – 49 years while most of the non <b>beneficiary</b> farmers are within the age of 30 – 39 years. About 15 % of the <b>beneficiary</b> farmers had no formal education while 46 % of the non <b>beneficiary</b> farmers had no formal education. The crop output level of the farmers showed that <b>beneficiary</b> farmers had more output than the non <b>beneficiary</b> farmers with an output difference of 1 % before fadama programme and a crop output difference was 9. 5 % after the project. Similarly, the farmers had 0. 16 % difference in their level of consumption before the fadama project and 13. 9 % difference in their consumption level after the project in favour of <b>beneficiary</b> farmers. The result further show that 75 (83 %) of the <b>beneficiary</b> farmers are food secure as against about 39 (34 %) of the non <b>beneficiary</b> farmers. The mean FSI of food secure <b>beneficiary</b> farmers was 3. 88 while that of food secure non <b>beneficiary</b> farmers had 1. 98. The FIG/S...|$|R

5|$|By 1977, the Food Stamp Program in Puerto Rico was larger, {{in terms}} of both the {{percentage}} of the population participating and expenditures, than any of the programs operating in the 50 U.S. States, with 56% of the Puerto Rican population participating in the program.

5000|$|A beach bum trust {{provision}}, {{in the law}} of trusts, {{ties the}} ability of a trust <b>beneficiary</b> to take from the trust to the <b>beneficiary's</b> own earnings.

5|$|Following {{cooperation}} between the local governmental council and the Prison Fellowship Romania Foundation, homeless people, street children and beggars are taken, identified and accommodated within the Christian Centers for Street Children and Homeless People, respectively, and the Ruhama centre. The latter features a marshaling center for beggars and street children, {{as well as a}} flophouse. As a consequence, the fluctuating movement of children, beggars and homeless people {{in and out of the}} centre has been considerably reduced, with most of the initial <b>beneficiaries</b> successfully integrated into the programme rather than returning to the streets.|$|E
5|$|Following its sale {{at auction}} {{following}} foreclosure, the Bowers Mansion was abandoned. Eventually purchased by Reno saloon owner Henry Riter, it was renovated and reopened as a resort in 1903. The hot springs were remodeled to feed warm swimming pools, and a spur was built from the Virginia and Truckee Railroad {{to serve the}} property. It continued to operate as a resort until 1946. It is now considered the finest example of the mansion houses built by the millionaire <b>beneficiaries</b> of the Comstock boom, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and {{is administered by the}} Washoe County Parks Department.|$|E
5|$|In May 1982, President Ronald Reagan {{announced}} {{the formation of}} the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Centennial Commission, led by Chrysler Corporation chair Lee Iacocca, to raise the funds needed to complete the work. Through its fundraising arm, the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Foundation, Inc., the group raised more than $350million in donations. The Statue of Liberty was one of the earliest <b>beneficiaries</b> of a cause marketing campaign. A 1983 promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an American Express card, the company would contribute one cent to the renovation of the statue. The campaign generated contributions of $1.7million to the restoration project.|$|E
50|$|In case (2), the <b>beneficiary</b> {{can request}} the {{applicant}} to specify his/her bank (the <b>beneficiary's</b> bank) as the advising bank in an L/C application. In many countries, this is {{beneficial to the}} <b>beneficiary,</b> who may avail themselves of the reduced bank charges and fees because of special relationships with the bank.
