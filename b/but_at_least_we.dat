500|$|England had wins against Southern Hemisphere {{teams in}} the 1970s; with {{victories}} over South Africa in 1972, New Zealand in 1973 and Australia in 1973 and 1976. The 1972 Five Nations Championship was not completed due to the Troubles in Northern Ireland when Scotland and Wales refused to play their Five Nations away fixtures in Ireland. England played in Dublin in 1973 and were given a standing ovation lasting five minutes. After losing 18–9 at Lansdowne Road, the England captain, John Pullin famously stated, [...] "We might not be very good <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> turned up." ...|$|E

In a May 2015 interview, Buck said, [...] "We have lots of things to figure out <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> {{know where we are}} going." [...] In March 2016, Bell stated that voice recording for the film was due to start later in the month, but in September of that same year, she retracted her earlier comments as mistaken and explained that she had been working instead on other Frozen projects such as the upcoming holiday special. In April 2017, Disney {{announced that}} the sequel would be released on November 27, 2019.|$|E
500|$|When {{the band}} {{completed}} writing and recording demos for the songs, the three headed to Los Angeles to record drum tracks at Chick Corea's Mad Hatter Studios in January 1999. Barker recorded {{the majority of}} his drum tracks in eight hours. The recording process for the album was completed over a period of four months, and production was handled at several production facilities in southern California, including Signature Sound and Studio West in San Diego, Big Fish Studios in Encinitas, and Conway Recording Studios and The Bomb Factory in Los Angeles. For Barker, the album was [...] "fueled by black coffee and Marlboro Lights"; he was hopeful for the album as the band were well-rehearsed and no time would be wasted. To record Enema of the State, Blink-182 turned to punk rock producer Jerry Finn, who previously worked on Green Day's breakthrough album, Dookie (1994). Hoppus and DeLonge were impressed with his work when they recorded [...] "Mutt" [...] for its placement on the American Pie soundtrack. Finn was harder on the trio to record better takes, and Hoppus credited Finn with knowing a great deal about punk rock music, but also helping the band establish a more pop-inspired sound. Finn came with an array of amps, effects and equipments; previously the band were forced to rent such equipment. Barker kept attempting to irritate Finn by sneaking in vibraslaps, which Finn hated. In addition, the band had so much fun with Finn that there were days when very little work was accomplished: [...] "Recording can get pretty monotonous, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> could laugh with Jerry," [...] recalled Hoppus. [...] "A pretty typical day would involve multiple takes for one part of one song, and then everyone would get naked and jump on Jerry." [...] The band chose [...] "never to work with anyone else again," [...] and Finn would produce their next three releases.|$|E

60|$|This {{is a great}} mystery! How can we {{understand}} it? How can {{we understand}} the Divine and eternal bond between Father and Son? <b>But</b> this <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> can understand, that loyalty and obedience are Divine virtues, part of the likeness of Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, and therefore divine graces, the gift of God's holy Spirit.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the release}} {{and success of}} the album, the group {{received}} several requests to remix their music which they turned down. Dorfmeister stated that they had [...] "felt like we'd already done it," [...] and [...] "I'd rather release nothing than something that is half and half...Perhaps we don't have so much output, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> then <b>we</b> don't release some bullshit." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2000, McCartney {{said the}} initial {{idea for the}} song began with Bobby Rydell's hit [...] "Forget Him" [...] with its call and {{response}} pattern, and that [...] "as often happens, you think of one song when you write another ... I'd planned an 'answering song' where a couple of us would sing 'she loves you' and the other ones would answer 'yeah yeah'. We decided that was a crummy idea <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> then had {{the idea of a}} song called 'She Loves You'. So we sat in the hotel bedroom for a few hours and wrote it—John and I, sitting on twin beds with guitars." [...] It was completed the following day at McCartney's family home in Forthlin Road, Liverpool.|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} the final lap {{collision}} with Gasly, Heidfeld {{said that he did}} not encourage Gasly to run on the inside line, as he was attempting to remain close behind teammate Rosenqvist so there would be no space available to in which the latter could steer into: [...] "For sure I didn’t touch him on purpose, and it’s a pity to finish like this, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> both made it over the line." [...] Gasly claimed Heidfeld had placed him in a position to impact the wall following the later releasing his brake pedal. Nevertheless, he described his weekend as [...] "very positive", but did not anticipate his advancing into super pole after having only one day's worth of experience driving in the series: [...] "We had a very busy schedule, especially with me arriving later on during the event. There was a lot to learn but we did great. We scored important points for the team. It was a great opportunity to discover a new discipline and I enjoyed the challenge very much." [...] Félix da Costa spoke of his disagreement of the drive-through penalty he received from the stewards after his collision with Duval in the closing laps of the event, something he said ended his race competitively.|$|E
6000|$|My friends, {{this is a}} great mystery, {{of which}} the wisest men as yet know but little, and confess freely how little they know. <b>But</b> this <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> know already, and can say boldly--all things praise God, by {{fulfilling}} the law which our Lord himself declared, when he said 'Not every one who saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Entertainment Weekly critic Hilary Busis {{gave it a}} mildly good review, but added, [...] "Like 'In the Name of the Brother,' {{it spent}} {{precious}} time giving backstory about a character who didn't really need more backstory; also like Once's previous episode, it did little to move season 2's master plot forward. <b>But</b> hey: <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> got more goofy-looking Giant Land CGI!" [...] The Huffington Post's Laura Prudom liked the episode and cited Josh Dallas's performance as Prince James and Jorge Garcia's return as Anton among the best highlights in the outing.|$|R

50|$|The {{first two}} {{movements}} {{seem to be}} composed specially for this quartet. The Scherzo was completed in Leipzig (before 1892) and initially intended for String Quartet No. 1, but was dismissed by composer and reused in his unfinished Symphony No. 1 (written by 1898). Though incomplete as a whole, separate parts of the symphony were performed, <b>but</b> (<b>at</b> <b>least</b> as <b>we</b> know) not the scherzo. Hill reused it again in its original form in this quartet. The Finale originates also from the Leipzig years, when it was composed as Rondo for cello or violin and piano.|$|R

30|$|Well, it doesn’t stop acting, obviously. You may {{say that}} it’s the concept of {{decisions}} that gets a little uncertain, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> what <b>we</b> pointed out was that organizations sometimes attend to goals sequentially rather than simultaneously. There’s this conflict, some groups get attended to today and other groups get attended to tomorrow and you hope that the joint effects will not be noticed. The organizations decentralize. They build buffers between the various preferences that they have so that {{one part of the}} organization is following one set of preferences and another part is following another set and the processes by which they’re made consistent with each other are very weak. Yes, they do make decisions, they take actions, but those actions do not necessarily fulfill any notion for consistent rationality.|$|R

"How! cruel man," [...] {{said the}} monk, when he {{observed}} this confirmation of his suspicions; [...] "wilt thou deny the guilt, even while thou bearest on thy person the blood thou hast shed?--Wilt thou longer deny that thy rash hand has robbed {{a mother of}} a son, our community of a vassal, the Queen of Scotland of a liege subject? and what canst thou expect, <b>but</b> that, <b>at</b> the <b>least,</b> <b>we</b> deliver thee up to England, as undeserving our farther protection?" ...|$|R

60|$|The eternal moral {{law which}} held {{good for the}} sinless Christ, who, though He were a Son, yet learned {{obedience}} by the things which He suffered, must hold good of you and me, and all moral and rational beings--yea, for the very angels in heaven. They have not sinned. That we know; {{and we do not}} know that they have ever suffered. <b>But</b> this <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> know, that they have submitted. They have obeyed, and have given up their own wills to be ministers of God's will. In them is neither self-will nor selfishness; and, therefore, by faith, that is, by trust and loyalty, they stand. And so, by consenting to lose their individual life of selfishness, they have saved their eternal life in God, the life of blessedness and holiness, just as all evil spirits have lost their eternal life by trying to save their selfish life and be something in themselves and of themselves without respect to God.|$|R

She says my father is very indignant at the great emigration of the nobility that is going on. In the first place, he holds that they are deserting their post {{in the face of the}} enemy; and in the second place, by their assemblage across the frontier and their intrigues at foreign courts against France they are causing the people to look with suspicion upon the whole class." ...|$|R

30|$|Finally, we use RankMerging, a {{supervised}} {{machine learning}} framework [18], recently developed to aggregate information from various ranking techniques, {{in a way that}} is suited to link prediction.

Notice that other learning-to-rank techniques could be used following the same scheme, but our framework is built for such situations with many ranked items as it is computationally linear. Moreover, it does not demand for a pair to be highly ranked according to all criteria, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one, which <b>we</b> believe is appropriate in the context of link prediction in a social network. Finally, it allows to investigate which features contribute to the final ranking and thereby, giving indications about the information sources which are important.|$|R
40|$|Are {{the laws}} of nature {{consistent}} with contingency about what happens in the world? That depends on what {{the laws of}} nature actually are, but it also depends on what they are like. This latter is our concern here. Different philosophic views give different accounts of the sort of thing a law of nature is. We shall look at three that are widely endorsed: ‘Humean’ regularity accounts, laws as relations among universals, and disposition/powers accounts. Our question is, given an account of what laws are, what follows about how much contingency, and of what kinds, laws allow? Of the three types we shall look at, powers stand out as especially apt for admitting contingency, or so it would appear from conversations we've been engaged in, both with powers advocates and with powers opponents. Our investigation here suggests that this is not so. A powers account of laws may admit contingency but it need not. Conversely, the other accounts may rule out contingency but they need not. In all three cases, we shall argue, the root idea of what laws are does not settle the issue of whether they allow contingency. Advocates of the different accounts may argue for one view or another on the issue, <b>but</b> (<b>at</b> <b>least</b> as <b>we</b> understand the accounts) this will be an add-on rather than a consequence of the basic view about what laws are...|$|R
