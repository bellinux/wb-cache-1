5|$|As a {{hurricane}} approaches Quahog, Rhode Island, the Griffin family prepares for its arrival. In his own attempt {{to pass the}} time, Brian decides to use magic mushrooms, to the curiosity of Stewie. As the mushrooms start to take effect on Brian, he begins having hallucinations and eventually cuts his own ear off. Stewie tries to help Brian <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> by his side {{and taking care of}} him, but Brian continues to perceive himself in an ugly world where he is continually attacked by various monsters resembling the Griffins and Quagmire. Brian eventually snaps out of the hallucination after Stewie helps him downstairs to drink some water.|$|E
5|$|Blacktip reef sharks, {{particularly}} small individuals, {{fall prey}} to larger fishes, including groupers, grey reef sharks, tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), and {{members of their own}} species. At Palmyra Atoll, adults avoid patrolling tiger sharks <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> out of the central, deeper lagoon. Their known parasites include the tapeworms Anthobothrium lesteri, Nybelinia queenslandensis, Otobothrium alexanderi, and Platybothrium jondoeorum, a myxosporidian in the genus Unicapsula, and the monogenean Dermophthirius melanopteri. One of the few documented examples of infectious disease in a shark was a fatal case of hemorrhagic septicemia in a blacktip reef shark, caused by the bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.|$|E
5|$|Clark's {{ultimate}} goal during the Revolutionary War was {{to seize the}} British-held fort at Detroit, but he could never recruit enough men and acquire sufficient munitions to make the attempt. Kentucky militiamen generally preferred to defend their homes <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> closer to Kentucky, instead of making a long and potentially perilous expedition to Detroit. Clark returned to the Falls of the Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued to defend the Ohio River valley {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E

Fleeing from the scene, Gil discovers his new appearance. Stern notifies Ann and Dr. Buckell about the incident, theorizing that the exposure to radiation caused a reversal of evolution, transforming Gil into a prehistoric reptile after exposure to sunlight. Stern suggests that Gil can control his symptoms <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> {{in the dark and}} remaining in the hospital, but admits that the patient cannot be held against his will.|$|E

5|$|The common {{hippopotamus}} inhabits rivers, lakes and mangrove swamps, where territorial bulls preside over {{a stretch of}} river and groups of five to thirty females and young. During the day, they remain cool <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippopotamuses rest near {{each other in the}} water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not territorial on land. The hippopotamus is a highly aggressive and unpredictable animal and has attacked humans. They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory canine teeth.|$|E

5|$|The novel's delayed {{publication}} was {{a result}} of Balzac's active social life. He spent many nights dining at the homes of friends, including novelist Eugène Sue and his mistress Olympe Pélissier, as well as the feminist writer George Sand and her lover Jules Sandeau. Balzac and Pélissier had a brief affair, and she became the first lover with whom he appeared in public. Eventually he removed himself from Paris <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> with friends in the suburbs, where he committed himself to finishing the work. In late spring he allowed Sand to read a nearly-finished manuscript; she enjoyed it and predicted it would do well.|$|E
5|$|United States Navy {{historian}} Frank Chadwick {{believed that}} de Grasse could have thwarted the British fleet simply <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> put; his fleet's size {{would have been}} sufficient to impede any attempt by Graves to force a passage through his position. Historian Harold Larrabee points out that this would have exposed Clinton in New York to blockade by the French if Graves had successfully entered the bay; if Graves did not do so, Barras (carrying the siege equipment) would have been outnumbered by Graves if de Grasse did not sail out in support.|$|E
5|$|After John's loss of Normandy, Maulay went to England and {{was given}} the manor of Upavon in Wiltshire. His grant of the manor was at the king's pleasure, because the manor, which had been held by a noble who {{forfeited}} his land in England <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> in Normandy after its loss, {{would need to be}} restored to its rightful holder if John recovered Normandy. He served as an envoy to Rome in 1213 and in 1214 was in command of royal forces at La Rochelle in France. In 1214 he married Isabella, the daughter and heiress of Robert of Thornham. Robert had died in 1211, so through his wife, Maulay acquired the Barony of Mulgrave in Yorkshire. Maulay paid the king 7000 marks as a fine for the right to marry Isabella, one of the highest fines paid for the right to marry under John. According to the medieval chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall, Maulay was the murderer of John's nephew Arthur of Brittany.|$|E

5|$|At his father's urging after graduation, Coolidge {{moved to}} Northampton, Massachusetts {{to become a}} lawyer. To avoid the cost of law school, Coolidge {{followed}} the common practice of apprenticing with a local law firm, Hammond & Field, and reading law with them. John C. Hammond and Henry P. Field, both Amherst graduates, introduced Coolidge to law practice in the county seat of Hampshire County. In 1897, Coolidge {{was admitted to the}} Massachusetts bar, becoming a country lawyer. With his savings and a small inheritance from his grandfather, Coolidge opened his own law office in Northampton in 1898. He practiced commercial law, believing that he served his clients best <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> out of court. As his reputation as a hard-working and diligent attorney grew, local banks and other businesses began to retain his services.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Warwick {{ordered his}} cannons to {{continually}} bombard the estimated {{position of the}} Yorkists' encampment. The Yorkists, however, had sneaked in close, and the Lancastrian artillery overshot their enemies. The Yorkist cannon, meanwhile, kept quiet to avoid betraying their location. As the armies settled down to rest, Montagu approached his brother and advised him of the troops' low morale. He suggested that, as the highest-ranking commanders, the brothers should fight on foot throughout the battle instead of riding on horse. The soldiers believed that mounted commanders tended to abandon them when the situation deteriorated. <b>By</b> <b>staying</b> on foot, the Nevilles would show that {{they were prepared to}} fight to the death with the men, inspiring the troops to stand and fight harder. Warwick agreed and the horses were tethered to the rear, near Wrotham Wood.|$|E
5|$|Following the European tour, Butthole Surfers {{experienced}} more upheaval when Nervosa left around Christmas 1985, {{as she was}} tired of the living conditions associated with constant touring and had a desire to be with family. She was replaced by another female drummer, Kytha Gernatt, who was dubbed Cabbage Gomez, Jr. in the press soon after joining the band. Cabbage had previously performed with Kathleen Lynch (a.k.a. Kathleen, a.k.a. Ta-Da the Shit Lady) in the band Easturn Stars; Lynch gained fame as Butthole Surfers' infamous naked dancer from 1986 to 1989. Kramer also left during this period and was replaced by Jeff Pinkus, who gave the band's bass position its longest period of stability <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> until 1994.|$|E

5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt was captured on video by several cameras, including those {{belonging to the}} Big Three television networks; ABC began airing footage at 2:42p.m. All three networks erroneously reported that Brady had died. While the Cable News Network (CNN) {{did not have a}} camera of its own at the shooting it was able to use NBC's pool feed, and <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> on the story for 48 hours, the network, less than a year old, built a reputation for thoroughness. Shocked Americans gathered around television sets in homes and shopping centers. Some cited the alleged Curse of Tippecanoe, and others recalled the assassinations of Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. Newspapers printed extra editions and used gigantic headlines; the United States Senate adjourned, interrupting debate of Reagan's economic proposals; and churches held prayer services.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Nurmi {{competed in}} three events. He won the 10,000 m <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> right behind Ritola until sprinting past {{him on the}} home straight. Before the 5000 m final, Nurmi injured himself in his {{qualifying}} heat for the 3000 m steeplechase. He fell on his back at the water jump, spraining his hip and foot. Lucien Duquesne stopped to help him up, and Nurmi thanked the Frenchman by pacing him past the field and offered him the heat win, which Duquesne gracefully refused. In the 5000 m, Nurmi tried to repeat his move on Ritola but had to watch his teammate pull away instead. Nurmi, looking more exhausted than ever before, only barely managed to keep Wide behind and take silver. Nurmi had little time to rest or nurse his injuries as the 3000 m steeplechase started the next day. Struggling with the hurdles, Nurmi let Finland's steeplechase specialist Toivo Loukola escape into the distance. On the final lap, he sprinted clear of the others and finished nine seconds behind the world-record setting Loukola; Nurmi's time also bettered the previous record. Although Ritola did not finish, Ove Andersen completed a Finnish sweep of the medals.|$|E
5|$|By lap 20, Max Verstappen, impeded by his tyre {{failure at}} the start, had moved up into twelfth {{while at the}} front, Hamilton {{extended}} his advantage over Bottas to 7.5 seconds on lap 24 with Vettel also moving closer to the Finn. After several drivers had opted to pit during the second safety car phase, most drivers at the front decided {{to come in for}} their regular pit stops starting on lap 25. Carlos Sainz crossed the white line when exiting pit lane, receiving a five-second penalty to be served at his second stop. Bottas {{was the first of the}} front runners to pit on lap 27, emerging into traffic. This allowed Sebastian Vettel to make up time <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> out longer, eventually emerging from his pit stop ahead of Bottas on lap 31. One lap later, Räikkönen made a pit stop as well, coming out just behind Bottas. Race leader Hamilton came in another lap later, retaining his lead without incident. On lap 37, Räikkönen used the Drag Reduction System (DRS) to move ahead of Bottas for fifth place, only for the Williams driver to retake the position in the next corner.|$|E

5|$|In {{a bid to}} stem Haidar's rise, the British {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with the Marathas and the Nizam of Golconda, culminating in the First Anglo-Mysore War in 1767. Despite numerical superiority Haider Ali suffered defeats at the battles of Chengham and Tiruvannamalai. The British ignored his overtures for peace until Haider Ali had strategically moved his armies to within five miles of Madras (modern Chennai) {{and was able to}} successfully sue for peace. In 1770, when the Maratha armies of Madhavrao Peshwa invaded Mysore (three wars were fought between 1764 and 1772 by Madhavrao against Haider, in which Haider lost), Haider expected British support as per the 1769 treaty but they betrayed him <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> out of the conflict. The British betrayal and Haider's subsequent defeat reinforced Haider's deep distrust of the British—a sentiment that would be shared by his son and one which would inform Anglo-Mysore rivalries of the next three decades. In 1777, Haider Ali recovered the previously lost territories of Coorg and Malabar from the Marathas. Haider Ali's army advanced towards the Marathas and fought them at the Battle of Saunshi and came out victorious during the same year.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two major}} land battles of the invasion, the Allies clearly {{adjusted}} their tactics to nullify the Persian advantage in numbers and cavalry, by occupying the pass at Thermopylae, and <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> on high ground at Plataea. At Thermopylae, until the path outflanking the Allied position was revealed, the Persians signally failed to adjust their tactics to the situation, although the position was well chosen to limit the Persian options. At Plataea, the harassing of the Allied positions by cavalry was a successful tactic, forcing the precipitous (and nearly disastrous) retreat; however, Mardonius then brought about a general melee between the infantry, {{which resulted in the}} Persian defeat. The events at Mycale reveal a similar story; Persian infantry committing themselves to a melee with hoplites, with disastrous results. It has been suggested that there is little evidence of complex tactics in the Greco-Persian wars. However, as simple as the Greek tactics were, they played to their strengths; the Persians however, may have seriously underestimated the strength of the hoplite, and their failure to adapt to facing the Allied infantry contributed to the eventual Persian defeat.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} aquatic {{habitats}} {{are used by}} different crocodilians. Some species are relatively more terrestrial and prefer swamps, ponds, and the edges of lakes, where they can bask {{in the sun and}} there is plenty of plant life supporting a diverse fauna. Others spend more time in the water and inhabit the lower stretches of rivers, mangrove swamps, and estuaries. These habitats also have a rich flora and provide plenty of food. The Asian gharials find the fish on which they feed in the pools and backwaters of swift rivers. South American dwarf caimans inhabit cool, fast-flowing streams, often near waterfalls, and other caimans live in warmer, turbid lakes and slow-moving rivers. The crocodiles are mainly river dwellers, and the Chinese alligator is found in slow-moving, turbid rivers flowing across China's floodplains. The American alligator is an adaptable species and inhabits swamps, rivers, or lakes with clear or turbid water. Climatic factors also affect crocodilians' distribution locally. During the dry season, caimans can be restricted to deep pools in rivers for several months; in the rainy season, much of the savannah in the Venezuelan llanos is flooded, and they disperse widely across the plain. Desert crocodiles in Mauritania have adapted to their arid environment <b>by</b> <b>staying</b> in caves or burrows in a state of aestivation during the driest periods. When it rains, the reptiles gather at gueltas.|$|E
