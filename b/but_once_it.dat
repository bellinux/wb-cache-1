5|$|Poniatowski's {{plans were}} ruined by the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising. The king did not {{encourage}} it, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>it</b> began he supported it, seeing no other honorable option. Its defeat {{marked the end}} of the Commonwealth. Poniatowski tried to govern the country in the brief period after the defeat of the Uprising, but on 2 December 1794, Catherine demanded that he leave Warsaw, a request to which he acceded on 7 January 1795, leaving the capital under Russian military escort and settling briefly in Grodno. On 24 October 1795, the act of the final, Third Partition of Poland was signed; one month and one day later, on 25 November, Poniatowski signed his abdication. Catherine died on 17 November 1796, succeeded by Paul I of Russia. On 15 February 1797, Poniatowski left for Saint Petersburg, Russia. He hoped to be allowed to travel abroad, but was not able to secure permission to do so. A virtual prisoner in St. Petersburg's Marble Palace, he subsisted on a pension granted to him by Catherine. Despite financial troubles, he still supported some of his former allies, and he tried to represent the Polish case at the Russian court. He also worked on his memoirs.|$|E

25|$|W. T. Cosgrave was a small, quiet man, and at 42 was {{the oldest}} member of the Cabinet. He had not sought the {{leadership}} of the new country, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>it</b> was his he made good use of it. One of his chief priorities was to hold the new country together and to prove that the Irish could govern themselves. Some historians have claimed that he lacked vision as a leader and was surrounded by men who were more capable than himself. However, during his ten years as President he proved an able leader of the emerging Irish state who had a sound judgement on the matters of state that the new country was facing.|$|E

He accordingly became a member of the Committee of Safety and was actively involved in preparing the defenses of Fort Union and Wilmington. In March 1814 Horsey presented a petition from the citizens of Delaware to repeal the Embargo Act of 1807; although he was able to get a committee appointed to consider the question, the effort was ultimately unsuccessful.

25|$|Carey and Hoffa battled {{fiercely}} at the Teamsters' {{convention in}} July 1996. Hoffa introduced {{a resolution to}} deny convention voting rights to 80 delegates from the union's staff, although this right {{had been given to}} all previous presidents. Carey ordered a voice vote on the motion, announced that the motion was defeated, and ignored calls for a division of the house. Throughout the convention, Hoffa and his supporters introduced resolutions and constitutional amendments intended to transfer authority from the president and give it to local and regional offices. Hoffa's supporters were well-organized and highly disciplined, and they defeated Carey on several minor votes. <b>But</b> <b>once</b> <b>it</b> became clear that Hoffa had a slim majority of the 1,900 delegates, Carey used the power of parliamentary procedure to delay or defeat the proposals, and his supporters brought the convention to a halt by offering amendment after amendment to Hoffa's proposals.|$|E
25|$|The {{regimes of}} Sarit and Thanom were {{strongly}} {{supported by the}} US. Thailand had formally become a US ally in 1954 {{with the formation of}} the SEATO While the war in Indochina was being fought between the Vietnamese and the French, Thailand (disliking both equally) stayed aloof, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>it</b> became a war between the US and the Vietnamese communists, Thailand committed itself strongly to the US side, concluding a secret agreement with the US in 1961, sending troops to Vietnam and Laos, and allowing the US to use airbases in the east of the country to conduct its bombing war against North Vietnam. The Vietnamese retaliated by supporting the Communist Party of Thailand's insurgency in the north, northeast, and sometimes in the south, where guerrillas co-operated with local discontented Muslims. In the postwar period, Thailand had close relations with the US, which it saw as a protector from communist revolutions in neighboring countries. The Seventh and Thirteenth US Air Forces were headquartered at Udon Royal Thai Air Force Base.|$|E

25|$|The term ‚Äúthangata‚Äù has {{had several}} {{meanings}} in Malawi {{in the last}} 120 years, and its traditional or pre-colonial use {{was very different from}} its uses in colonial and modern times. The word exists in the Chewa and the related Mang'anja languages, and its first pre-colonial meaning was ‚Äúhelp‚Äù or ‚Äúto assist‚Äù, in the sense of freely-given reciprocal help such as neighbours might give each other building huts or clearing fields. It also had the meaning of the agricultural work that a member of the village community did for his chief. The ownership of land in much of Malawi was vested in the community, not individuals. Traditional leaders acted as trustees over communal land, and granted the right to use it to individuals in their communities. By custom, these leaders received in gifts in kind or labour from those in their community who had benefitted. This was also called thangata. When communal land was plentiful, community leaders could not demand thangata, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>it</b> became scarcer in the colonial period, and particularly after the introduction of Indirect rule on 1933, the chiefs could impose a condition of thangata work on any grant. In {{the last two or three}} decades, chiefs have begun to require cash sums or rents to allow the use of communal land, but these cash payments are not called thangata.|$|E
25|$|In 1716, Enr√≠quez made a {{suggestion}} to Carre√±o that they organize an expedition {{and take the}} island of Saint Thomas. The interim governor sent an official proposal and noted his belief that the privateer and 500 militiamen would suffice and that no royal investment would be needed, but ultimately desisted of the idea after the project failed to gain approval. Alberto Bertolano took the office of governor from Carre√±o, being sworn on August 30, 1716. As usual, Enr√≠quez tried to earn his favor. However, due to his role as interim governor, Bertolano distanced himself {{from any of the}} groups that dominated the Puerto Rican society. This approach did not please Enr√≠quez, who went on to claim that his opponents, led by Pozo, were being favored. An argument that was ironically repeated by them. However, the governor was instrumental in helping Enr√≠quez to resume his role as a privateer. After months of reorganization that required contracting a new crew, he was able to command two small vessels, a sloop and a schooner, to resume his venture. These two ships were lost shortly afterwards, resetting the process. Enr√≠quez decided to purchase four sloops, naming them El Aguila, La Perla, La Aurora and El F√©nix. His fleet was systematically rebuilt, with the further acquisition of El Delf√≠n, La Modista, La Peque√±a Aurora and Nuestra Se√±ora de Altagracia, Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario and San Miguel y las Animas. The rebuilding phase extended for a period of three years, and it experienced the loss of La Perla, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>it</b> was concluded, Enr√≠quez's fleet was stronger than its original incarnation. He now employed around 300 sailors and requested help to military supervision to control them. The fleet captured eight Danish vessels named La Margarita, La Juana, Neptuno, Vliegende, Leeduyuel, Leojane and Brelot. St. Thomas's governor complained to Bertolano, noting that they were being captured despite the fact that both nations were not at war, but this claim was dismissed, citing that no foreign ship was allowed to fish near Puerto Rico. La Modista went on to capture three of the four British vessels captured after that nation joined an alliance and declared war on Spain in 1719. Most were captured in a reconnaissance mission, however, their delivery was complicated by the arrival of a British privateer, who engaged them in battle. La Modista won that exchange and returned to San Juan with his captures. Another one, loaded with military provisions, was captured the following year. However, this declaration of war also hurt Enr√≠quez's interest, since he was forced to surrender all of the property that belonged to the Royal Asiento. He declared that he no longer possessed anything that belonged to the company. With the embargo taking an extended time period, Enr√≠quez likely hid the Royal Asiento's property during the wait and keep them for himself. Pozo was not pleased with this outcome and requested the intervention of dean Mart√≠n Calder√≥n, expecting the church to intervene. Harassed by the ecclesiastical investigation, Enr√≠quez requested a license permitting a move to Cuba, which was granted but never materialized. The arrival of a new bishop, Fernando de Valdivia, prevented the migration. Before leaving Spain, the friar had received requests to favor the privateer. Enr√≠quez paid the voyage and offered Valdivia all sorts of gifts, including a house, jewels and slaves, spending at least 3,000 pieces of eight. For the next two weeks, the Bishop only had contact with the privateer, even ignoring the governor. Valvidia eventually established a lukewarm relation with the authorities, which was always superseded by his friendship with Enr√≠quez. With his power, the Bishop revoked the actions of Mat√≠n Calder√≥n and placed the blame of the conflicts on the dean and treasurer. Operating on its own, La Aurora captured a Netherlands sloop, La Sara, near the coast of Santo Domingo. Meanwhile, La Perla, La Juana and El F√©nix were employed in diplomatic voyages. Transporting royal documents when requested became a recurrent mission. La Aurora and El √Åguila ferried members of the judiciary branch, including Fern√°ndez. La Modista continued with this success, also seizing a French frigate named La Trinidad de Burdeos off Vieques. However, this particular prey created a conflict between Enr√≠quez and Pozo, who argued that it should have been considered spoils of war rather than privateering goods. The privateer won this conflict, retaining its cargo. Ultimately, both sides continued to perpetually exchange accusations and insults. Despite running a generally neutral administration, Bertolano was accused of being biased by both sides after his term concluded.|$|E
