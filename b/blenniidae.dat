50|$|Sneaky {{copulation}} is {{a strategy}} used by many aquatic organisms who portray sexual mimicry. Several {{studies have found that}} small male fish will look and behave like the female of their species in order to gain access to female territory and copulate with them. In the <b>Blenniidae</b> family, the Salaria pavo, female bleniid fish will show a specific colour pattern and movement when they want to approach a male and copulate with him. The male guards a territory, and when the female lays her eggs, the parental male protects that territory until the eggs hatch. A second type of males, the sneaker males, is parasitic and resembles the female bleniid fish in their small size, colour, and movement patterns. This allows them to intrude into the nest guarded by the parental males. Sneaker males approach the nests with the same colour patterns and movements that the females hold. Most cases of sneaker males are seen when there is a female already inside the nest although sometimes the sneaker fish enters the nest alongside a female. This species of fish releases the sperm before the female releases her eggs into the water making it possible for the sneaker fish to fertilize an egg, even if the female is not present in the nest.|$|E
