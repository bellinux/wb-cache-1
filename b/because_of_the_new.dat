5|$|As {{part of the}} New York City Transit Authority's 1968 Program for Action, the {{construction}} of the full-length Second Avenue Subway was proposed. It was to be built in two phases—the first phase from 126th to 34th Streets, the second phase from 34th to Whitehall Streets. This ultimately went unbuilt <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York City fiscal crisis of 1975.|$|E
5|$|Building on the {{features}} of the XT, Ford Australia at one point considered not releasing the sports-oriented Falcon XR6 <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> XR6 Turbo model. However, Ford overturned this decision before production. A specifically designed body kit distinguished the XR6 from other variants, except for the XR6 Turbo and XR8 which shared the sports bodywork. The naturally aspirated engine was identical to the engine used on the XT and Futura, and the five-speed manual transmission came as standard.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> {{limitations}} {{placed on}} future Merina monarchs by Rainilaiarivony and the Hova courtiers, Radama's strangling represented {{more than a}} simple coup d'état. The ruling conditions imposed on Rasoherina reflected a power shift toward the oligarchs of the Hova commoner class and away from the Andriana sovereigns, who had traditionally drawn their legitimacy from the deeply held cultural belief that the royal line was imbued with hasina, a sacred authority bestowed by the ray aman-dreny (ancestors). In this respect, the new political structure in Imerina embodied the erosion of certain traditional social values among the Merina elite, who had gained exposure to contemporary European political thought and assimilated a number of Western governance principles. It also signalled the expansion of a rift between the pro-European, progressive elite to which Rainilaiarivony and his brother belonged, and {{the majority of the population}} in Madagascar, for whom traditional values such as hasina remained integral to determining the legitimacy of a government—a divide that would deepen in the decades to come through Rainilaiarivony's efforts to effect a modernizing political and social transformation on a nationwide scale.|$|E

5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game in a {{courtroom}} {{similar to that of the}} main series and made a few additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new gameplay elements. Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. Because of this theme, it made sense to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist. Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, but based on fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. Figuring out how to move the game from the courtroom to the crime scene was a challenge for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E
5|$|Peter, Cleveland, Joe, and Quagmire are {{spending}} the evening at The Drunken Clam, when Peter is reminded {{to pick up}} Meg from the roller skating rink. They {{then go to the}} rink and continue to enjoy themselves, but forget to pick up Meg when they leave. After skating home in the rain, Meg asks the family for her own car. The next day, Peter takes his daughter to the local car showroom, where she shows an interest in a sedan. Distracted by a large tank at the dealership, however, Peter is tricked into buying it. At first, Peter uses the tank himself, despite it being intended for Meg, but then he teaches Meg to drive it. Later that day, however, the two accidentally run over Joe, and he impounds the tank. Frustrated, Meg decides to earn the money for her own car, and is able to get a job at the local Quahog mega store, Superstore USA, working under a man named Mr. Penisburg. The shops in Quahog soon become bankrupt <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> superstore, and causes people to lose their jobs of Superstore USA's one job taking quahog, like cleveland and mort putting planks on the doors so they will become abandoned.|$|E

25|$|Up to that time, British iron {{manufacturers}} {{had used}} considerable amounts of imported iron to supplement native supplies. This came principally from Sweden from the mid-17th century and later also from Russia {{from the end}} of the 1720s. However, from 1785, imports decreased <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> iron making technology, and Britain became an exporter of bar iron as well as manufactured wrought iron consumer goods.|$|E
25|$|While the {{majority}} of serfs were farmers bound to the land, a noble could also have his serfs sent away to learn a trade or be educated at a school, in addition to employing them at businesses that paid wages. This happened more often during Catherine’s reign <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> schools she established. Only in this way could a serf leave the farm {{for which he was}} responsible.|$|E

25|$|This disarray at the Justice Department {{meant that}} the government's lawyers often failed to foster viable test cases and {{arguments}} for their defense, subsequently handicapping them before the courts.

25|$|According to Microsoft, Direct3D 10 {{will be able}} {{to display}} some {{graphics}} up to 8 times faster than DirectX 9.0c <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> improved Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM).

The same game will not be compatible with both Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 9 or below. Games would need to be developed for both APIs, one version for Direct3D 9 and below if targeting Windows versions prior to Windows Vista and another version using Direct3D 10 if targeting only Windows Vista. Windows Vista does, however, contain a backward compatible Direct3D 9 implementation.|$|E
25|$|In 1814, the French era ended {{suddenly}} as Trier {{was taken by}} Prussian troops. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Franco-German borders of 1792 were restored in the 1814 and 1815 Paris peace treaties. The city was proclaimed part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815 and made part of the Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine, with six administrative districts. Trier became seat of one these district administrations, the Regierungsbezirk Trier. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> political situation and the new customs frontiers in the West, the economy of Trier began a steady decline that was to last until 1840. The Province of the Lower Rhine was merged into the Rhine Province in 1822.|$|E

50|$|For the 2009 season, the Power {{moved to}} the Women's Football Alliance and changed their name to the Gulf Coast Riptide. Despite another well-played season and another 6-2 record, {{for the first time}} in {{franchise}} history, the Riptide missed the playoffs. This is <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WFA's <b>new</b> playoff system which did not allow for any wildcards from the American Conference and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riptide's two losses to the Jacksonville Dixie Blues.|$|R
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> this, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Automatic Proofreader was {{introduced}} in February 1986. This version used a more sophisticated checksum algorithm that could catch transposition errors. It also took spacing into account if they were within quotes (where they were generally significant to the program's operation), while ignoring them outside of quotes (where they were not relevant). Also, <b>the</b> decimal display <b>of</b> <b>the</b> checksum was replaced with a hexadecimal value.|$|R
25|$|In Portugal, as in {{the rest}} of Europe, the {{printing}} press {{played a key role in}} its Renaissance. The first printing presses came to Portugal by the hand of Jewish printers via Italy. The first book printed in Portuguese in Portugal was the Sacramental, printed in Chaves, in 1488, by Clemente Sanches de Vercial. By 1490, books were being printed in Lisbon, Porto, and Braga. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> access to mass production of language and literature pieces, the Portuguese Renaissance saw a great flourishment for written work, from treatises to theatre, as well as the advancement and sophistication of the Portuguese language. Because of Portugal's key place in global relations, at the time, literary works of the Portuguese Renaissance influenced a great deal of foreign literary movements and linguistic studies.|$|E

He held this record until 2016 when Jamala from Ukraine won with a record 534 points (but <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> scoring system with separate sets of televotes and jury votes, the results are not comparable with each other). His average score of 9.4 points from every voting nation was the highest since the wide use of televoting began in 1998. Rybak received sixteen scores of 12 points, also a new record, surpassing the previous record of ten held by Katrina and the Waves (1997) and Helena Paparizou (2005); this record was surpassed in 2012, by Loreen, who received eighteen.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{retaining wall}} malfunction delayed {{the construction of}} the soccer/football field, as it had to be rebuilt. The manufacturer said that the wrong type of stones had been chosen for the wall, meaning all retaining walls on the campus had to be taken down and rebuilt. This set the field projects back several months. The wall was finally completed in October 2006. The company which installed the wall and provided the stones paid for the damages. The upper field contains an artificial turf baseball field and the lower contains a six-lane track and an artificial turf lacrosse/soccer/football field. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> field space, girls' lacrosse was started in 2007 at the JV level. The baseball field, complete with stands, backstop, and sliding-dirt cutouts, was completed in mid-October 2006, while the soccer/football field wasn't complete until the spring of 2007, and the track wasn't complete until July 2007.|$|E
2500|$|In 1899 the Great Central Railway {{arranged}} {{to join with}} the Great Western to construct a new route to London and built Marylebone station as its terminus. A new line, built by the Great Western Railway, ran from Paddington via [...] and Beaconsfield to High Wycombe and thence to Princes Risborough. The single track line between High Wycombe and Princes Risborough was upgraded to a double track. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gradient <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Up line followed a different route (with a short tunnel at Saunderton) from the existing single track, which became the Down line (with a few changes <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gradient or for other reasons).

This was the first election in American history in which a Republican candidate carried every single Southern state, continuing the region’s transformation from a Democratic bastion into a Republican one as Arkansas was carried by a Republican presidential candidate {{for the first time in}} a century. By this time, all the Southern states, except Arkansas and Texas, had been carried by a Republican in either the previous election or the one in 1964 (although Republican candidates carried Texas in 1928, 1952 and 1956). As a result of this election, Massachusetts was the only state that Nixon did not carry in any of his three presidential campaigns.|$|E
25|$|The {{culture of}} the Turco-Persian world in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries was tested by invading armies of inland Asia. The Mongols under Genghis Khan (1220–58) and Timur (Tamerlane, 1336-1405) {{had the effect of}} {{stimulating}} development of Persianate culture of Central and West Asia, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> concentrations of specialists of high culture created by the invasions, for many people had to seek refuge in few safe havens, primarily India, where scholars, poets, musicians, and fine artisans intermingled and cross-fertilized, and because the broad peace secured by the huge imperial systems established by the Il-Khans (in the thirteenth century) and Timurids (in the fifteenth century), when travel was safe, and scholars and artists, ideas and skills, and fine books and artifacts circulated freely over a wide area. Il-Khans and Timurids deliberately patronized Persianate high culture. Under their rule developed new styles of architecture, Persian literature was encouraged, and flourished miniature painting and book production, and under Timurids prospered Turkic poetry, based on the vernacular known as Chaghatai (today called Uzbek; of Turkic Qarluq origin).|$|E
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in {{the graph}} to the right, the {{retailer}} has seen rapid growth since the end of 2008, doubling the number of their stores from 61 in November 2008 to 123 in December 2009. Company owner Lalani said that finding sites was getting easier <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> empty rate tax on commercial property. Whereas, previously, landlords would decline to have a discount shop filling their empty stores, they are now less reluctant to fill them with discount stores, as they are now being charged for stores which lie empty. Stuart Donnelly, head of property at 99p Stores, notes that landlords are now being much more proactive, inviting potential retailers to come and have a look at their locations with the hope of them taking up a lease, as the property market has been badly affected by the recession, allowing the company to drive competitive deals to further expand their portfolio of stores with less expenditure, something that wouldn't have been possible just a few years ago. Landlords are now regarding 99p Stores as an anchor tenant due to the significant number of customers one of their stores can bring to a location.|$|E
