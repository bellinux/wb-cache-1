D. The year of presentation: 2017 Annotation: Developmental coordination disorder is typical for poor motor learning and motor coordination that cannot be related to any neurological or mental disease. The exact reason of it stays still unknown. There are theories that say that dysfunctional collaboration of afferent systems causes developmental coordination disorder. Thanks to afferent systems a human organism is able to perceive different modalities. One of the modalities is a perception of verticality. In theoretical part of this thesis we summarized information about developmental coordination disorder and postural and balance control. In experimental part we tested 35 pupils of primary school (age 13 - 15). Using MABC- 2 we classified the pupils into children with and without predispositions for developmental coordination disorder. Then we tested their ability of perceiving subjective visual and subjective haptic verticality. According to statistical evaluation there is no [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to analyze the composition of mortar in order to enhance the use of milk serum and its application in earth constructions. Development of the study involved, initially, a <b>bibliographic</b> review and <b>identification</b> of dairy industry producers in the Paraiba Valley, São Paulo, with milk residue storage facilities. The next stage consisted in the preparation of three adobe molds, based on technical reproductions, of the composition of historic constructions. Subsequently, the molds were submitted to laboratory tests: preservation and compression resistance. This was followed by execution of the mortar with milk serum and bacteriological tests, anchoring, and plasticity through the application of mortar. The adobe molds were observed over a period of 15 days, with even the cracked molds shown to be useful for purposes of simulating risk situations. The technical viability analysis of the sample milk serum mortar applied to a historic construction and exposed to the natural elements for a period of 1 year revealed no deformities. After a full year of research, we found the presence of acid milk residue to be a major concern among dairy producers. Further, the difference between acid and sweet milk serum gave rise to a new challenge given the different chemical properties of the two serum types, which can alter the structure of the mortar and its efficacy. To this end, the research work was extended into 2009 with implementation of a new stage aimed at adapting Brazilian technical standards through a technical evaluation of historic mortar and the applicability of acid serum to the residue process...|$|R

Considering these changes, {{the purpose of this}} study is to investigate how digital technologies can be used by the above-mentioned institutions as contemporary tools that contribute to their actions, as well as to understand the characteristics of some of the main three-dimensional digitizing and digital manufacturing technologies, to identify the state of the art of using digital technologies in cultural heritage, especially the museological. We also tried to apply digital photogrammetry and rapid prototyping methods in a sample of the Sculpture Collection of the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Lisbon (FBAUL), to present proposals for the use of the digital resources created to collaborate in the diffusion, investigate and document of the respective collection, in addition to raising and discussing the challenges that must be faced to the component of access to digital technologies (in relation to equipment and operational training), legal restrictions (intellectual property and public domain) and the management of the data created (digital preservation) according to the practical experience.

40|$|Purpose : The {{purpose of}} the article is to present user’s {{satisfaction}} with searching fiction in the library catalogue and to identify key bibliographic elements influencing user’s decision to select a particular version of an individual book title. The research tries {{to answer the question}} of adequacy of existing <b>bibliographic</b> records for <b>identification</b> and selection of fiction in the library catalogue as compared to browsing physical books on the shelves. Methodology/approach : Quantitative research included 108 adult users of three public libraries. Data were collected by conducting interviews and observation. The study was limited to three book titles: The Godfather (Mario Puzo), The catcher in the rye (Jerome David Salinger) and Quo vadis? (Henryk Sienkiewicz). Each participant was first asked to select among the bibliographic records and then could choose from the physical units. Analysis/results : The browsing of physical units on the shelves and book searching with the help of library staff proved to be the prevailing ways of book searching. The author and the blurb are generally the two decisive elements for a user to select a particular book, especially when browsing the shelves with the so-called recommended books. When searching the library catalogue, key bibliographic elements for user’s selection are the language, publication year, the length and the publisher. The user satisfaction rate with bibliographic records was 81 %; however, 43 % library users would rather select another book when they saw all possible versions. Two main reasons for the change were the condition of the book and the quality of print. Research limitation : The research was limited by space and time, the sample size and methodological approach, the selection of book titles and their versions. The research was mostly concentrated on how library users identified and selected different versions of the three book titles; actual browsing, searching and finding in a library catalogue were excluded. The future research should not be limited only to fiction but should be extended to non-fiction, different types of library materials on various media and to the study of impact and the possibility to include enhanced bibliographic records to the library catalogue. Originality/practical implications: The research is innovative as it focuses on two user tasks (identification and selection) and deals with the importance of bibliographic elements in the library catalogue and the selection criteria for publications in physical form. It deals with the (non) use of library catalogue and encourages librarians and cataloguers to study user needs when searching for fiction in the catalogue. The results could enhance the development and improvement of the library catalogue for electronic book searching. <br /...|$|R

Annotation This thesis deals with the influence respiratory function in children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The theoretical part provides an overview of respiratory physiotherapy techniques that can be used in the care of the airways in people with SMA. The practical part deals with the question whether it is possible using the selected techniques of respiratory physiotherapy after six weeks of training to affect ventilatory parameters in children with SMA. The group of six probands with SMA I. - III. type in the range of the age from 3. 5 to 12 years participated in this study. To objectively assess changes was performed spirometry efore the beginning of the therapy and after its conclusion. The main therapy was daily training with inspiratory breath simulator CliniFlo.

Prague: Charles University, 2 nd Faculty of Medicine, Department of Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine, 2017, 59 p. Supervisor of the bachelor's thesis Mgr. Magdaléna Lepšíková. Abstract Swimming is a physical activity that is often recommended by physicians as compensatory activity. It is symmetrical sport which takes place in aquatic environment. This sport has many benefits and can be done at any age. Our goal was {{to find out if}} competitive swimming had an effect on statics and dynamics of the spine. To measure static sagittal parameters we used DIER Formetric III 4 D. Dynamic tests were measured by spinal development tests. The trunk stabilization was detected using Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS) concepts. We observed 11 children aged 11 - 12. These children were examined twice in the bachelor thesis, first one before the start of racing swimming and second one after 10 months. In our diploma thesis, these children were examined again after 3 years of racing swimming. We also watched a set of 11 adult swimmers. We compared their results with standards.

Jakub Kokštejn Name of the dissertation: Physical {{activity}} {{of children with}} motor difficulties Workplace: Department of Sports Games Supervisor of the work: Doc. PaedDr. Rudolf Psotta, Ph. D. Year of presentation: 2011 Abstract Objective: Current knowledge of developmental disorders in motor skills of school children suggest potential negative impacts {{on the development of}} the personality of the child in the mental, social psychological and behavioural areas and also in the area of competence at school. Very little is known about how an insufficient level of motor skills of a child can limit his/her physical activity. This work was performed to discover whether developmentally determined motor deficit in children of older school age is a risk factor for lower physical activity (PA) and whether the attention of the child has a mediation function in the relationship between the level of motor skills and his/her physical activity. Methods: The research was based on analytical-descriptive examination of the motor skills of children, their physical activity in weekly regimes and the attention level, with subsequent comparison of children with a motor deficit (MD) and children without MD, through correlation analysis and analysis of the mediative [...] ...|$|E

Abstract The purpose of this thesis was to investigate influence {{of the position of}} the lower limbs on selected thigh muscles activity. Special attention was paid to activity of mm. vasti. The first part summarizes the literature findings. Based on these theoretical findings, the research plan and hypotheses were subsequently prepared. For the purpose of this work, method of surface electromyography was chosen. The research was primarily realized in a group of 14 healthy individuals. Muscle activity was measured during selected physical activities in both open and closed kinematic chains. We were interested in how different settings of lower limb joints effect the activity and timing of mm. vasti and ischiocrural muscles. In the next part of the research muscle involvement was compared between the control group of healthy subjects and the group of people after plastic surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament. The results indicated some interesting trends, particularly in the timing of muscles. Some of the main outcomes of this work are the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Perna viridis es un bivalvo procedente del Indo-Pacífico que habita en la zona intermareal y ha invadido varios ecosistemas de la costa norte del estado Sucre, Venezuela. Con la finalidad de realizar un estudio sobre las comunidades de moluscos asociadas a esta especie y sus relaciones tróficas, se llevaron a cabo muestreos bimensuales entre octubre/ 97 y agosto/ 98, en un banco natural de mejillones a dos metros de profundidad en la costa norte de la península de Araya (10 ° 40 ’N - 48 ° 63 ’W). Los organismos fueron recolectados delimitando el área con una cuadrícula de 0. 25 m². Se identificaron los organismos hasta la categoría de especies utilizando claves específicas para moluscos y bibliográficamente se les determinó categoría trófica. Se capturó un total de 1 235 individuos de P. viridis y asociados a la especie 3 163 especímenes pertenecientes al phylum Mollusca, contenidos en tres clases: Bivalvia,Gastropoda y Polyplacophora. Éstas estuvieron representadas por 50 especies correspondientes a 10 órdenes, 24 familias; para los gasterópodos se contabilizaron 25 especies, para los bivalvos 22 y tres para los poliplacóforos. Del total de las especies, 40 % fueron filtradoras, 26 % carnívoras, 24 % herbívoras y el 10 % restante presentó dos categorías. De las filtradoras las más representativas fueron: Perna perna, Musculus lateralis, Crassostrea rhizophorae y Ostrea equestris; en el grupo de los carnívoros dominaron tres especies de la familia Columbellidae:Mitrella lunata, Anachis obesa y Nitidella ocellata y para el grupo de los herbívoros destacaron dos especies de la familia Fisurellidae: Diodora cayenensis y D. minuta. Se registraron dos especies filtradoras-detritívoras, y tres especies herbívoras-filtradoras representantes del género C repidula. El alto porcentaje de filtradores sería un indicativo de que dentro de este sistema probablemente hay una mayor disponibilidad de fracciones alimenticias para este grupo. Mollusc {{communities}} {{associated with}} the green mussel Perna viridis (Mollusca: Bivalvia) and their trophic relations on the north coast of Araya Peninsula, Sucre State, Venezuela. Perna viridis (Linné, 1758) is an Indo-Pacific bivalve of the intertidal zone that has invaded several ecosystems of the north coast of the Sucre State,Venezuela. Bimonthly samplings were carried out between October 1997 and August 1998 to study the mollusc communities associated with this species and their trophic relationships. Studies were conducted on a naturally-occuring bank of mussels two meters deep on the north coast of the peninsula of Araya (10 ° 40 ’N - 48 ° 63 ’W). Sample organisms were collected withing areas defined by a quadrat of 0. 25 m², and were identified to the species level using taxonomic keys that also included <b>bibliographic</b> <b>identification</b> of trophic level. A total of 1 235 individuals of P. viridis were collected, along with 3 163 specimens of associated species belonging to the phylum Mollusca, including bivalves, gastropods and polyplacophora. The associated mollusc organisms represented 50 species corresponding to 10 orders and 24 families, including 25 gastropod species, 22 bivalves and three polyplacophorans. With regard to trophic level 40 % of the 50 species were suspensivores, 26 % carnivores, 24 % herbivores and the residual 10 % represented two categories (suspensivore-detritivore, herbivore-suspensivore). Of the suspensivores the most common were: Perna perna, Musculus lateralis, Crassostrea rhizophorae and Ostrea equestris. The carnivore group was dominated by the three species of the Family Columbellidae, Mitrella lunata, Anachis obesa and Nitidella ocellata. The group of herbivores was dominated by {{two members of the}} family Fisurellidae, Diodora cayenensis and D. minuta. Two species of suspensivore-detritívore and three species of herbivore-suspensivore were also found in the genus Crepidula. The high percentage of suspensivores was thought indicative, inside this ecosystem, that there is probably a higher degree of nutritious fractions available to this group. Rev. Biol.
