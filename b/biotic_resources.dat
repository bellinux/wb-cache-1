50|$|To {{understand}} the conservation efforts in China, {{it is important}} to know something about the events of the several past hundred years of China's history relating to social attitudes, pressures on nature and natural resources, and the political ambition to safeguard the natural environment. Each of these are significant factors and determinants of conservation efforts. Up until the year 1700, China was a country that was rampant with land reclamations, growing land exploitation, and wars. These series of events led to a huge upsurge in the diminishing of the natural biomass and as well as a reduction in spatial distribution of <b>biotic</b> <b>resources.</b> The significance of this situation was that this drastic dwindling of resources made the people of this region aware of the relationship between utilization and conservation. From 1911 to 1949, China began to move into the direction of modern industry, urbanization, civil wars, and agriculture. This transition period brought with it the depletion and disappearance of various renewable resources, as well as the pollution of various biotopes. This lack of conservation eventually led to a deteriorating environment, which meant lower standards of living for the Chinese human population. This is the point when both the government and the people of China came to the epiphany that the environment matters. It was not until 1956 that modern nature conservation efforts begin to develop.|$|E

In this respect, the Working Group Eco-Efficiency & Sustainable Enterprises at theWuppertal Institute with Dr. Christa Liedtke as head, has developed a research landscape that gives a general overview of the theme of <b>biotic</b> <b>resources</b> - their sustainable {{production and}} use.

That is to realizeecologically, socially and economically a triple gain strategy along the three pillars of sustainability - to save resources, to create wealth and to strengthencompetitiveness. To implement this strategy the Working Group Eco-Efficiency and Sustainable Enterprises has developed the methodology tool of COMPASS (COMPAnies and Sectors' Path to Sustainability).

Fish {{production is}} {{the only kind of}} animal production that is still dominated by extractive activity, endangered because of overexploitation of natural resources and a rearing activity with a rapid expansion. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which estimates local- to global-scale environmental impacts, has been adapted to seafood production systems. Scientific publications increasingly propose methodological improvements and case-study applications of LCA in the fishery and aquaculture sectors, with the combined objectives of better describing and understanding their biophysical interactions with the environment and supporting decision-making and eco-labelling of seafood products. In particular, the development of innovative indicators better defines impacts of fisheries on the marine ecosystem (e. g., benthos damage, by-catch, <b>biotic</b> <b>resource</b> use).

40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} a review on sea-use impacts {{and how they}} are handled in life cycle assessments (LCA). It aims at defining the impact pathways for occupation and transformation impacts on marine ecosystems due to human activities (constructions, fishing, aquaculture, navigation). First, a review was performed on human interventions leading to environmental impacts in marine areas and on additional fishery-related impact categories used in LCA of seafood, in order to identify the main methodological deficiencies existing in LCA of seafood products. Second, the sea-use impact category has been defined, by detailing the human interventions leading to impacts on the marine environment and which should be accounted for in LCA. Subsequently, the identification and description of the possible impact pathways linking activities and interventions to impact categories are carried out at endpoint and midpoint levels. This assessment has been based on a review of existing methods of land use, and suggests the use of certain indicators, which could be available for different types of marine activities and ecosystems. This study highlights the needs to account for impacts of human activities due to sea use. Additional indicators have often been added in LCA of seafood, to assess the impacts of seafloor destruction and biomass removal. By extending the scope to other activities than fisheries, many interventions lead to impacts on marine ecosystems: biomass removal and benthic construction, invasive species release, shading, artificial habitat creation, noise, turbidity, and changes in original habitat availability. The impact pathway definition and the identification of the most relevant methods for sea use highlighted the need to assess impacts on ecosystem services (life support functions, global material cycling, and detoxification of pollutants) and on biodiversity as well as <b>biotic</b> <b>resource</b> depletion. A consensus for <b>biotic</b> <b>resource</b> depletion assessment still needs to be found despite recent innovative proposals.

However, this assumption is not realistic as the environment generally varies with time.

Using a simple non-linear system, the proposed model can be linked to an intra-guild predation model in which predator and prey share the same resource.
