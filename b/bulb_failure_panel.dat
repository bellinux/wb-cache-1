50|$|Christmas lights using {{incandescent}} bulbs are somewhat notorious for being difficult to troubleshoot and repair. In the 1950s and 1960s, the series circuit connected light sets would go completely dark when a single bulb failed.

40|$|To {{maximize}} {{the use of}} available resources provided onboard the International Space Station, {{the development of an}} efficient lighting 1 system is critical to the overall performance of the CPBF. Not only is it important to efficiently generate photon energy, but thermal loads on the CPBF Temperature and Humidity Control System must be minimized. By utilizing optical coatings designed to produce highly diffuse reflectance in the visible wavelengths while minimizing reflectance in the infrared region, the design of the fluorescent light module for the CPBF is optimized for maximum photon flux, spatial uniformity and energy efficiency. Since the Fluorescent Light Module must be fully enclosed to meet (ISS) requirements for containment of particulates and toxic materials, heat removal from the lights presented some unique design challenges. By using the Express Rack moderate C, temperature-cooling loop, heat is rejected by means of a liquid/air coolant manifold. Heat transfer to the manifold is performed by conduction using copper fins, by forced air convection using miniature fans, and by radiation using optically selective coatings that absorb in the infrared wavelengths. Using this combination of heat transfer mechanisms builds in redundancy to prevent thermal build up and premature <b>bulb</b> <b>failure...</b>|$|R

40|$|The work {{described}} {{in this part of}} the thesis is involved mainly with uprating a 55 W air-turbine driven permanent magnet generator to 250 W. It is shown that the electrical performance of the generator can be predicted from a simple equivalent circuit comprising an, induced emf source with a series inductance and resistance. When matching the generator and turbine characteristics iron losses are included as an additional torque requirement. Analysis has identified that the most important parameters which determine the rating-of the generator are the stator flux, linkage, stator inductance, and number of pole pairs. Investigations have therefore centred around the calculation of these quantities. Previous design methods for calculating the parameters have been dependent on experimental data for particular magnet geometries. They are not sufficiently general to permit design calculations for magnets having radically different shapes or properties. Therefore the finite element method is used to predict the magnetic field distribution, from which the stator winding flux linkages and inductance, and the saliency torque, are predicted, an important parameter when matching the turbine and generator at starting. The finite element method offers significant advantages over analytical methods because it can account accurately for leakage flux, it can handle complex configurations of magnetic circuit and the directional properties of the magnet, and it allows different parts of the magnet to operate at different flux density levels. The performance of the generator is predicted with reasonable accuracy. Alternative rotors for the 250 W generator have been designed and tested. Results have shown that the existing generator can be adapted to the 250 W design simply by using a rare-earth magnet rotor, and selecting a suitable stator winding turns factor for matching the generator and bulb. Two methods of matching the load characteristics of the turbine, generator and bulb, to produce an acceptable system have been developed. A simple electronic protection circuit has been designed to prevent the 250 W generator from overspeeding in the event of <b>bulb</b> <b>failure.</b> Additionally it can limit over-voltages, caused by variations in the pressure of the air supply, which would otherwise decrease the life of the bulb.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model based on displacement compatibility {{was used to}} analyze the link-up and residual strength behavior of stiffened panels with lead and multiple site damage (MSD) cracks. Fifteen inch wide stiffened aluminum specimens with various lead and MSD crack lengths and two different stiffener configuration were tensile tested to determine crack link-up and <b>panel</b> <b>failure</b> loads. A tip stress intensity reduction factor was verified experimentally through fatigue tests of stiffened panels, and used in two different link-up and <b>panel</b> <b>failure</b> criteria to predict the lead crack link-up and <b>panel</b> <b>failure</b> loads. The ligament yield criterion with full area compounding, and modified for the stiffened panel, was shown to accurately predict lead crack link-up load. An alternate version of the ligament yield criterion with moderate area compounding also gave reasonable results. The apparent fracture toughness criterion consistently overpredicts link-up loads for specimens with MSD. The stiffener failure criterion was shown to be able to predict <b>panel</b> <b>failure</b> to within less than 4 percent for specimens with a true lead crack. The net section failure criterion gives good results for specimens where the lead crack was arrested at a hole. ^ The stiffened panel model was also incorporated into a fatigue crack growth prediction code and used to predict the crack growth behavior of 15 inch wide stiffened panel specimens with lead and MSD cracks. The stiffened panel fatigue crack growth model was able to predict the crack link-ups and total panel lives of the stiffened panel specimens with good accuracy. ^ Parametric studies of sheet link-up stress and fatigue life to lead crack formation for 75 inch wide specimens was performed using the stiffened panel models that had been verified experimentally. A simple model was developed for the effect of cracks in the stiffeners on the link-up and fatigue behavior of the sheet. That model does not predict stiffener failure loads and stiffener crack growth. The parametric sheet link-up stress study showed that even small MSD cracks (0. 05 inches) reduce the sheet link-up stress between 15 and 28 percent depending on stiffener size and material. Also, panels with heavy stiffeners are affected more severely than panels with light stiffeners. The presence of cracks in the stiffeners has very little effect on the sheet link-up stress until the stiffener is almost completely cracked. The fatigue study indicates that the time to lead crack formation is the critical parameter. Once two MSD cracks have linked to form a lead crack, further link-up occurs within a few cycles, until the lead crack reaches the stiffener. Increasing the stiffener size does not increase the lead crack formation life very much, but increasing the stiffness of the stiffener (i. e. going from aluminum to titanium) can increase lead crack formation life by a factor of 2 to 4. Cracks in the stiffeners have very little effect on the lead crack formation and propagation in the sheet. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R
