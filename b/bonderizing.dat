50|$|Parkerizing, <b>bonderizing,</b> phosphating, or {{phosphatizing}} is {{a method}} of protecting a steel surface from corrosion and increasing its resistance to wear {{through the application of}} a chemical phosphate conversion coating. Parkerizing is usually considered to be an improved zinc or manganese phosphating process, and not to be an improved iron phosphating process, although some use the term parkerizing as a generic term for applying phosphating (or phosphatizing) coatings that does include the iron phosphating process.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{cold forging}} processes, {{friction}} between materials and dies strongly influences material flow, forging load and {{damage to the}} dies. Therefore, several methods to evaluate friction have been proposed. However those methods are not well simulated for the severe conditions occurring in actual forging processes. In this study, a new method to evaluate friction coefficients is proposed. The method applies backward extrusion, which enables us to create high pressure, large surface area expansion and a long sliding distance, for the measurements. The unique feature of the die set used in this method is a rotating punch at a very slow angular velocity. By a combination of measured load and torque, friction coefficients can be monitored throughout the measurement process. Friction coefficients were measured for four types of lubrications; mineral oil, cold forging oil, <b>bonderizing</b> and dry-in-place. With these results, the proposed method enables us to measure friction coefficients under severe forming conditions...|$|E
