25|$|When {{there is}} a talk about women and Buddhism, I have noticed that people often regard the topic as {{something}} new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times and so many women are practicing the Dharma now. However, {{this is not the}} case. The female sangha has <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition. The roots are there, and we are simply re-energizing them.|$|E

One will {{have to wait and see}} whether the highest officers in the Japanese army succeed, as they have indicated, in stopping the activities of their troops, which continue even today.|$|E

25|$|The 156th Parachute Battalion and {{the rest}} of the 4th Parachute Brigade landed to the west of Arnhem on the second day of the battle 18 September 1944. Their {{objective}} was to hold a position on the high ground north of Arnhem at Koepel. With the 156th Parachute Battalion leading on the right followed by the 10th Battalion on the left. By dawn the following day the battalion was just north of the Utrecht to Arnhem railway line. When they came under attack from German 88mm guns. Both battalions were ordered to start an assault on the position at 07:00. After repeated attacks the battalion got no further forward. The defenders from the 9th SS Panzer Division had <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> two days and were well dug in. The German position included infantry, self propelled guns and armoured cars. The battalion fought all day in the woods but its losses were very heavy, with 'A' Company losing all of its officers. Finally brigade headquarters obtained permission to withdraw south of the rail line into Oosterbeek. The battalion started to pull back over the rail line but in the confusion of the withdrawal no orders had been given about where they were to go once south of the rail line. Most of 'B' and 'Support' Companies headed towards Wolfheze while the rest of the battalion headed towards Oosterbeek, the two parts of the battalion were never reunited. The units in Wolfheze and the remnants of the 10th Parachute Battalion now prepared to defend the village.|$|E

In 1999, when Betty was celebrating 30 years on-screen, Alison Boshoff of the Daily Mail praised the character's never changing style: [...] "for 30 years, one favourite fixture of Coronation Street has remained exactly the same [...] barmaid Betty Turpin. With her neatly-set hair, comfortable, bustling manner, and brilliant smile, she has been dispensing homespun advice – and, of course, those celebrated hotpots – at the Rovers Return for more than a generation." [...] Commenting on her 30th anniversary with the show, Betty Driver said, [...] "It is just amazing that I've <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> 30 years. I suppose I have never really counted up the time I've been with the show, because I still enjoy it so much and am always looking forward rather than back. Really, it has been a wonderful experience and I feel very glad I was able to stick around for so long." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2010, Jacqui {{embarked}} on a [...] "surprise" [...] relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss). Moss first hinted at their romance months prior stating: [...] "I think Rhys is going {{to fall in love}} again. It's a character already in the village. It's quite surprising. It's a character who's <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going to work, because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are going to get back together, but people are really taken with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration and we try to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible." [...] She also adopted a [...] "couple name" [...] for the pair titled [...] "Ja-Rhys".|$|E
500|$|On 8 June 2007, Alonso {{signed a}} five-year contract, stating, [...] "I {{knew there was}} {{interest}} from other clubs {{but it was always}} my idea to stay here. I have <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> three seasons now and have such special feelings for the club and the supporters. I understand what Liverpool means to so many people. It is such a special club and I just didn't want to leave." [...] The 2007–08 season started well for the Spaniard: Gerrard's absence led to Alonso playing in a more advanced position and he scored twice in a 6–0 rout against Premier League newcomers Derby County. The bright beginning was short-lived, however, as a minor injury sustained in a game against Portsmouth became aggravated in training. The metatarsal injury forced him out of training for six weeks but his return to the first team was rushed and his injury recurred in his first game back. Alonso's determination and passion proved to be his downfall, and he later reflected, [...] "I had been feeling a bit tired around that time because it was only my first game back and the match was very fast. But as a player you don't want to come off, particularly when the team is winning and I stayed on." ...|$|E

During a Yankees' road game at Cleveland, Lofton {{recorded}} his 2,000th career hit. After Lofton's single, Indians fans began an ovation in honor of Lofton. [...] "I didn't know what to expect. I figured I'd get a few claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they just kept going. If there was a storybook {{way for me to}} get it, to get it in Cleveland, it was something to remember." [...] New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 10161. To begin the post-season, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 20 series lead when Lofton stated, [...] "My ultimate goal is for me to try to win a championship. I'm at a point in my career [...] I've <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again." [...] Then Yankees would go up in the series three games to none before becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a series after holding a 30 series.|$|E

500|$|The {{deciding}} Game 7 of the 2015 Finals {{was scheduled}} to be played at 7:00 PM on April 30, 2015 at the WFCU Centre in Windsor, Ontario. The Express shootaround was set to take place before that of the Rainmen. The road team was supposed to arrive for warm-ups at approximately 1:00 PM, but entered the stadium approximately two hours earlier. Express assistant coach Gerry Brumpton recounted, [...] "They snuck in here before they even had the light on. We were here in the dark, I opened up the curtain and I looked in and there they were. They were still here working out. So they had <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a while." [...] The Express told their opponents to leave the arena, but they refused, with one Rainmen player dunking a basketball instead. Windsor's Bill Jones then attempted to take a ball from Halifax center Liam McMorrow, but the player [...] "flinched," [...] pretending to throw a punch. According to Rainmen player Forrest Fisher, Jones tackled McMorrow to the ground and Express guard Tony Bennett followed up by hitting McMorrow with a chair. Referring to the Rainmen, Jones said, [...] "A couple of them kicked me and tried to take swings at me. And my players were there and they came to my rescue {{to be able to get}} me up." [...] Soon the violence escalated, with staff members and players from both teams involved. At around 10:40 AM, Windsor police received a phone call [...] "that between 15 to 20 men were involved in an altercation." [...] By the time they arrived at the WFCU Centre, however, the fighting was over and the Rainmen players had already reached their team bus.|$|E

2500|$|The {{newspaper}} highlighted {{four factors}} driving {{the opposition to}} the mosque: a dislike of immigrants, a fear that Christianity was losing its grip on a Bible Belt heartland, a [...] "swell of fear and hatred" [...] prompted by terrorist attacks, and the insecurity of the worst economic climate since the Great Depression. In past slumps, Chinese immigrants had been ostracized for being non-Christians, Catholics had been ostracized for being [...] "the wrong kind of Christians", and this time Muslims were suffering the brunt of prejudice. Rabbi Rami Shapiro noted that [...] "Muslims are in the way of God's plan" [...] for some anti-Muslim Christian Zionists, who believe that Muslims in Iran and Iraq will be forced out of their homes by Israeli expansion that will pave the way for the Second Coming of Jesus. Professor Ron Messier, who teaches Islamic studies and lives in Murfreesboro, commented: [...] "It's happened because this is an election year and I think there were some political candidates who thought that, here in Middle Tennessee, {{a lot of people have}} very right leanings and they could gain some political leverage by promoting fear about people who have <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> 20 years or more without ever being an issue." ...|$|E

It had initially been tipped as a single. Davis said Houston wanted an island song, so they reached out to Akon.

Houston's cover begins with a slow piano intro, which picks up in the middle.|$|E
