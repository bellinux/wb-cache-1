50|$|Trapezoidal {{profiles}} and cassettes {{have been}} known in Europe for around 100 years. Today's popular characteristic profile shape came to Europe from the USA in the 50s and has steadily and noticeably gained in relevance since about 1960. At the present moment, the proportion of load <b>bearing,</b> <b>room</b> sealing trapezoidal profiles used in the overall area of all new and slightly sloping roofs amounts to 90%. Above all else the wide acceptance has resulted from the simple constructive training, the easy, fast assembly, the appealing formal style and last but not least, the economicalness of the trapezoidal profile construction.|$|E

It was an apple--a large, red-mottled, firm pippin, pleasing to behold. In a paper bag on a high shelf in that corner he had found it.

No doubt some recent bivouackers, lunching in the deserted house, had left it there.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to {{contributions from the}} public, endowments from Romanta T Miller, Jr, have sustained the library, with significant gifts in 1943 and 1955. In both instances, the gift required small matching donations by the village and town governments. In 1960, the F G Ebsary Foundation provided a grant of $5,000, which was spent on a large room for children's materials. In subsequent years, the Ebsary Foundation has continued to support the library, helping to pay for building maintenance, a roof, the heating system, new paint, and wiring.

60|$|The thickset man {{had been}} pacing the room fretfully, and now turned {{and went through the}} archway towards the balcony, from which the noise of a distant crowd still came in gusts and cadences.

Then they ran the entire thing on its easy, noiseless <b>bearings</b> across the <b>room</b> to a remote corner where a twisted cable looped rather gracefully from the wall.

50|$|The strange {{creature}} {{emerges from}} Jekyll’s <b>room,</b> <b>bearing</b> {{a note in}} Jekyll’s handwriting that orders the household staff to treat the stranger - “Mr Hyde” - as himself. Hyde then slips out into the night, terrorising the patrons of a nearby tavern before finding himself lodgings. From these rooms he begins a career of evil, until one night he attacks and injures a crippled child. Outraged witnesses corner Hyde and force him to agree to compensate the boy. Hyde reluctantly leads one man back to Jekyll’s house and gives him money. During this passage of events, a worried Dr. Utterson sees Hyde entering Jekyll’s house. Inside, Hyde takes a potion that transforms him back to Jekyll.|$|R
40|$|Open loop, {{experimental}} {{force and}} power measurements of a three-axis, radial, heteropolar magnetic <b>bearing</b> at <b>room</b> temperature for rotor {{speeds up to}} 20, 000 RPM are presented in this paper. The bearing, NASA Glenn Research Center's and Texas A&M's third generation high temperature magnetic bearing, was designed to operate in a 1000 F (540 C) environment and was primarily optimized for maximum load capacity. The experimentally measured force produced by one C-core of this bearing was 630 lb. (2. 8 kN) at 16 A, while a load of 650 lbs (2. 89 kN) was predicted at 16 A using 1 D circuit analysis. The maximum predicted radial load {{for one of the}} three axes is 1, 440 lbs (6. 41 kN) at room temperature. The maximum measured load of an axis was 1050 lbs. (4. 73 kN). Results of test under rotating conditions showed that rotor speed has a negligible effect on the bearing's load capacity. A single C-core required approximately 70 W of power to generate 300 lb (1. 34 kN) of magnetic force. The room temperature data presented was measured after three thermal cycles up to 1000 F (540 C), totaling six hours at elevated temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A new, rapidly convergent, {{numerical}} procedure for internal loading distribution computation in statically loaded, singlerow, angular-contact ball bearings, {{subjected to a}} known combined radial and thrust load, which must be applied so that to avoid tilting between inner and outer rings, is used to find the load distribution differences between a loaded unfitted <b>bearing</b> at <b>room</b> temperature, and the same loaded bearing with interference fits that might experience radial temperature gradients between inner and outer rings. For {{each step of the}} procedure it is required the iterative solution of Z + 2 simultaneous nonlinear equations – where Z is the number of the balls – to yield exact solution for axial and radial deflections, and contact angles. work is concerned with single-row angular-contact ball bearings (Fig. 1) that are designed to support combined radial and thrust loads or heavy thrust loads depending on the contact angle magnitude. The bearings having large contact angle can support heavier thrust loads. Fig. 1 shows bearings having small and large contact angles. The bearings generally have groove curvature radii in the range of 52 - 53 % of the ball diameter. The contact angle does not usually exceed 40 o...|$|R
