He writes with a lover's lavish extravagance and a yogi's self-discipline. His funny poems are heartbreaking and his serious ones are hilarious.|$|R
50|$|The Little Foxes {{established}} {{a new high}} of nine nominations without winning a single Oscar.

Citizen Kane was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, but won only one for Best Original Screenplay.|$|R
