5|$|Adidas Terrestra Silverstream was the {{official}} match ball {{used in the}} final. It was assembled and marketed by German sport firm Adidas, and was the ninth ball in the European Championship series, as well {{as part of the}} Adidas Finale. The ball's design was created by British independent brand specialist company Design Bridge, and influenced by the waters, in the Netherlands and Belgium. The ball contains synthetic foam layers, making it more comfortable to grip and smoother to control. The Terrestra Silverstream was later unveiled as {{the official}} match <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UEFA Euro 2000.|$|E

5|$|England reached 3/106 by stumps on {{the fourth}} day, but the final day started poorly when Compton edged the second <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day—bowled by Johnston—to a diving Miller at second slip; he knocked the ball upwards before falling {{on his back and}} {{completing}} the catch as the ball went down. Just as in the first innings, Compton’s dismissal precipitated a collapse, and Australia dismissed England for 186 to complete victory by 409 runs.|$|E
5|$|She then {{played in}} the three T20s held at Bellerive Oval in Hobart. The first of these matches was a curtain-raiser to the match between the Australia and West Indies men teams, {{and was the first}} match to be shown live on free-to-air {{television}} in Australia. New Zealand batted first and Australian fast bowler Ellyse Perry extracted an outside edge from captain Aimee Watkins from the first <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match. The ball flew straight to Healy's mid-riff and she dropped it. Watkins went on to score 44 from 36 balls as New Zealand made 7/117 and Healy's only dismissal was to catch Nicola Browne from Sthalekar's off spin. Healy came to the crease at 6/107 {{at the end of the}} 19th over and had scored three runs from as many balls and found herself on strike for the final <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match, bowled by Browne, with Australia needing three runs for the win. The delivery was wide outside off and Healy's expansive shot took the outside edge of the bat and flew towards the vacant first slip area. It would have gone for a match-winning four runs but for New Zealand wicket-keeper Rachel Priest diving across and catching the ball one-handed in her right glove, handing the tourists a two-run victory.|$|E
5|$|The Bal des Ardents (<b>Ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Burning Men) or Bal des Sauvages (<b>Ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wild Men) was a {{masquerade}} ball held on 28January 1393 in Paris {{at which}} Charles VI of France {{performed in a}} dance with {{five members of the}} French nobility. Four of the dancers were killed in a fire caused by a torch brought in by a spectator, Charles's brother Louis, Duke of Orléans. Charles and another of the dancers survived. The ball was {{one of a number of}} events intended to entertain the young king, who the previous summer had suffered an attack of insanity. The event undermined confidence in Charles's capacity to rule; Parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful members of the nobility. The public's outrage forced the King and his brother Orléans, whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted regicide and sorcery, to offer penance for the event.|$|E

He {{featured}} in a tenth-wicket partnership of 100 with Geff Noblet, who scored only nine as Tallon farmed the strike effectively. This saw the match scores tied on the last <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match. Tallon also made seven dismissals for the match. Queensland lost more than they won during the season, but Tallon continued to be productive, scoring 453 runs at 34.85 and making 26 dismissals in seven matches.|$|E
5|$|Woodfull had an {{opportunity}} to inflict more blows on the tourists as Victoria played them for the second time ahead of the final Test. While his state was unable to force a result, Woodfull continued his strong form with 44 and 73 not out. The Australian captain finished the season with a duck from the opening <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fifth Test, bowled after failing to offer a shot, but Australia won by an innings an 72 runs in the equivalent of a single day's play on a sticky wicket.|$|E

On the defensive {{side of the}} <b>ball,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 120 FBS teams, the Crimson Tide was ranked {{near the top of}} all major defensive categories nationally and first in all categories in conference. They ranked first in total defense (250.00 yards per game), scoring defense (10.93 points per game) and rushing defense (76.36 yards per game) and ranked seventh in passing defense (173.64 yards per game). Individually, C. J. Mosley led the team with 107 total tackles, 41 of which were assisted, and 66 solo tackles. Adrian Hubbard was tied for 73rd nationally, 8th in conference and 1st on the team with 7 quarterback sacks. Hubbard was also 20th in conference and 1st on the team with 11 tackles for loss.

5|$|Australia {{had less}} than 15 minutes of batting before the {{scheduled}} close of play. Barnes made an unsuccessful appeal against the light after the first <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> innings, which was a wide by Edrich. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss. Ideal batting conditions and clear weather greeted {{the players on the}} second day. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Morris was bowled by Laker's off spin. Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 when Barnes cut Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Evans. The ball bounced away and the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to Australia's total. He failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which went straight on, clipped the outside edge and was taken at slip by Edrich.|$|E
5|$|Dewes and Len Hutton {{opened for}} England, {{a move that}} {{attracted}} criticism of Yardley for exposing the debutant Dewes to the new ball bowling of Lindwall and Keith Miller. After Hutton opened the scoring with a single from the second <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, Dewes was on strike. The single had almost turned into a five when Sam Loxton fired in a wide return, but Sid Barnes managed to prevent from going for four overthrows. Dewes took a single from the opening over—bowled by Lindwall—and thus faced {{the start of the}} second over, which was delivered by Miller. Dewes had been troubled by Miller in the past. During the Victory Tests in 1945, Miller had repeatedly dismissed the batsman, and during a match for Cambridge University against the Australians earlier in the tour, Dewes had used towels to pad his torso against Miller's short balls. During his short innings, Dewes was also visibly nervous and kept on moving around, unable to stand still.|$|E
5|$|England made 141 and Bradman {{forced them}} to follow on. Miller removed Hutton again, this time caught by Sid Barnes from the first <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> innings. He {{combined}} with Barnes 45 minutes later to remove Hutton's opening partner Washbrook to leave England at 3/33. The pitch, still rain-affected, hastened England's defeat by an innings and 332 runs within 44 overs. Miller finished with 2/17 from 11 overs in the second innings to end with match figures of 9/77. England had fallen to their heaviest Test defeat on Australian soil, losing 15 wickets {{in the space of}} 210 minutes on the fifth day. Miller's highly productive Ashes debut led to further speculation as to whether he was willing to end his Test career to turn professional in England. Miller continued to ignore Rawtenstall's requests for confirmation and refused to comment on the issue to the media, hoping that he would get a better job offer in Australia in the meantime.|$|E

5|$|He then top-scored with 190 in the Third Test in Sydney {{to set up}} a large first innings lead of 270 and an innings victory. Harvey alone {{made more}} than his opponents in the first innings and the innings saw him {{complete}} 1000 Test runs against the South Africans in only eight Tests. Harvey made it consecutive centuries in as many matches, with 84 and 116 in Adelaide. Starting with an on-driven boundary off the first <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last day's play, Harvey's century took 106 minutes and was the fastest record in the Australia since World War II and the sixth fastest of all time in Australia. With leading pacemen Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller breaking down in the match, Harvey bowled for only the third time in his Test career. He took his first of three wickets at Test level, that of Russell Endean as a depleted Australian attack could not defeat the visitors who finished seven wickets down.|$|E
5|$|However, {{he started}} the Tests slowly, failing to take a wicket in the first innings of the First Test at Brisbane before {{securing}} 3/43 in the second as the match was drawn. He removed Barrington, Pullar and David Sheppard. However he returned to form with 96 and 4/80 against South Australia, and then added a milestone to his first-class career with a hat-trick against Western Australia in Perth. Having taken a wicket with the first <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> innings, Davidson proceeded to bowl both Barry Shepherd and John Parker before Russell Waugh was caught by Norm O'Neill in the first innings. He ended with 5/40 and took 2/32 in the second innings as the visitors completed an innings victory.|$|E
5|$|In response, Bangladesh lost Tamim Iqbal for a duck in {{the first}} over, giving debutant Ajmal Shahzad his first ODI wicket from his third <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match. Bresnan removed the other Bangladeshi opener in the 10th over, {{the first of his}} four wickets in the match. This wicket brought {{together}} Mushfiqur Rahim and Aftab Ahmed, who both played aggressively, putting on 56 together in the next ten overs, but when Aftab Ahmed was run out looking for a non-existent run, Bangladesh started to struggle. Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan both fell after making good starts and the required run rate started to rise, making a Bangladeshi victory look improbable. Slow scoring between Naeem Islam and Mahmudullah took victory further away, and Bangladesh eventually finished 45 runs short of their target, granting England a series whitewash.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match against South Africa, Poulton {{came in at}} 1/9 {{after the fall of}} Villani {{at the end of the}} first over.

The pair put on 58 from only 37 balls before Poulton was caught from the first <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighth over. Australia collapsed and lost 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused, before completing a 22-run win. In the final group match against the West Indies, Poulton came in at 1/33 and hit 15 from 13 balls, including three fours. Australia finished on 7/133 and won by nine runs to finish the group stage unbeaten at the top of their quartet.|$|E
5|$|Macartney hit 105 as Australia amassed 7/708 {{declared}} against Hampshire {{and then}} made 193 as Australia compiled 621 and defeated Northamptonshire by an innings and 484 runs. The two matches were separated by a match against Surrey, which Macartney missed due to injury. In the latter match, Macartney came in at first drop after the hosts took a wicket from the first <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match, and he scored 193 of the 318 runs scored {{while he was in}} the middle. Macartney took only 135 minutes and hit 31 fours as Australia added more than 300 in just over two hours of batting.

5|$|Off the pitch, Miller privately {{decided that}} he would not honour his Rawtenstall contract. He {{secretly}} accepted an offer to relocate to Sydney to work as a liquor salesman and play cricket. Back in a good frame of mind for the Fourth Test in Adelaide, Miller took one wicket in each innings, but he shone with the bat. After England had made 460, Miller came in at 3/207, and was 23 not out by the close of the second day. He hit the first <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next day for six, and accumulated 67 runs in the opening 71 minutes, to reach his maiden Test century. The Englishmen utilised leg theory to prevent easy scoring, but as the tail began to be dismissed, Miller accelerated, launching drives into the crowd, despite the presence of four men on the fence. Miller ended unbeaten on 141 but the match petered out into a high-scoring draw. Before the last Test, Miller played for Victoria against England, taking 4/65.|$|E
