40|$|The {{protective}} {{effect of the}} compound preparation Roter, principally <b>bismuth</b> <b>subnitrate</b> and the other base constituents of these tablets, magnesium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate, were assessed using the standard alcohol model of gastric ulceration in the rat.

The study was assessed by measurement of areas of gastric ulceration and tissue prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) levels. Alcohol alone caused gross ulceration and reduction in PGE 2 synthesis compared to controls (P less than 0. 001).

Ade-quate curative therapeutics must include, so far as is compatible with safety, eradication of the initiating factors of arteriolar stimulation and irritation such as foci of infection, plumbism, unwise dietary habits, arsenical poisoning and many other intoxications of endogenous or exogenous origin (4).

A ratio of 20 % radiopacifier and 80 % white Portland cement by weight was used for analysis. Pure Portland cement and dentin served as controls. Cement/radiopacifier and dentin disc-shaped specimens were fabricated, and radiopacity testing was performed according to the ISO 6876 / 2001 standard for dental root sealing materials. Using Insight occlusal films, the specimens were radiographed near to a graduated aluminum stepwedge varying from 2 to 16 mm in thickness. The radiographs were digitized and radiopacity compared with the aluminum stepwedge using Digora software (Orion Corporation Soredex, Helsinki, Finland). The radiographic density data were converted into mmAl and analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and Tukey-Kramer test (alpha = 0. 05). The radiopacity of pure Portland cement was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) than that of dentin, whereas all cement/radiopacifier mixtures were significantly more radiopaque than dentin and Portland cement alone (p < 0. 05). Portland cement/bismuth oxide and Portland cement/lead oxide presented the highest radiopacity values and differed significantly from the other materials (p < 0. 05), whereas Portland cement/zinc oxide presented the lowest radiopacity values of all mixtures (p < 0. 05).

Aim: To investigate the effect of a combination of acid-suppressing and prokinetic drugs or eradication therapy on the course of H. pylori-positive FD. Method: A total of 157 patients with endoscopically-proven H. pylori-positive FD and no response to 4 weeks of antacid therapy were randomly divided into 2 groups. 84 were placed on <b>bismuth</b> <b>subnitrate</b> plus metronidazole and amoxicillin (group A) and 73 received ranitidine and metoclopramide for 4 weeks (group B). The severity of symptoms (7 items) were assessed on a 6 -point categorical scale. Group B patients who failed to respond to their medication underwent eradication therapy after 3 months. All patients were followed and assessed for 9 months after the end of therapy by the same clinicians who initiated the therapy. Results: At the end of the medication period, symptom’s score decreased significantly, and to the same extent. At 3 -month follow-up moderate or complete response was achieved in 27. 4 % (group A) and 19. 2 % (group B) by intention-to-treat analysis. 34 patients of group B, not responding to treatment, underwent eradication therapy and followed as group A. Eradication of H. pylori was successful in 60 of 110 controlled patients (54 %). After 9 -month follow-up, complete or moderate response was observed in only 30 % of 60 patients in whom H. pylori had been eradicated (intention-to-treat analysis), compared to 38 % in 50 noneradicated cases (p > 0. 05, 95 % CI: 19 – 43 vs. 24 – 52). Conclusion: Eradication therapy with bismuth compound is effective as ranitidine plus metoclopramide in a subgroup of patients with FD not responding to antacid therapy. There is no difference in improvement between patients cured or not cured from H. pylori infection. This suggests that bismuth compounds were effective in FD when used in the eradication regimen.

A total of 150 Holstein cows (average production of 9, 000 kg of milk per lactation), with four functional udder quarters without clinical mastitis was included in the study. All animals were dried-off 60 days before the expected calving date. Two teats positioned diagonal-contralaterally received only dry cow antibiotic, control group C (n= 300) and the other two teats, treatment group T (n= 300) received dry cow antibiotic and infusion with an internal teat seal. Data from SCC variable were transformed by log base- 10 transformation. Duncan’s test was used accepting 5 % as the level of statistical significance. The occurrence of intramammary infection (IMI) and chronicity rate, and frequency of microorganisms isolated at drying and immediately postpartum in teats of group C and group T were evaluated using a non-parametric Chi-square Test, accepting 10 % as the statistical significance level. There was a decrease in the occurrence of new infections in the early postpartum in cows which the sealant was used (C= 19. 6 %, T= 11. 4 %). In the postpartum period, Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 16 teats in C and seven in T. The greatest reduction was observed for Escherichia coli (8 vs 1) in group T. There was no effect using the internal sealant on the frequency of isolation of environmental Streptococus. The use of sealant reduced the prevalence of subclinical mastitis cows between drying-off and the early postpartum period (C= 51 % versus T= 42 %) and resulted in a lower somatic cell count (SCC) in the treatment group when compared with the control group (T= 1, 073 x 103, C= 1, 793 x 103). The use of the internal teat seal combined with dry cow antibiotic is effective in the prevention of IMI during the dry period and early lactation and results in the reduction of SCC in immediate postpartum period. The treatment is effective in reducing infection between dry-off and the immediate postpartum caused by major and minor pathogens. However, no effect on infections caused by contagious pathogens was observed...|$|E
