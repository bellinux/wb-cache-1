Brooks was as much known for his swimming achievements as he was for disciplinary incidents. He often found himself in conflict with officialdom and threatened with sanctions. His international career ended when he was suspended for drinking 46 cans of <b>beer</b> <b>on</b> the return flight to Australia after the 1986 Commonwealth Games. In retirement, he became a news presenter and sports commentator, but was fired amid alcohol problems.|$|E

5|$|The company {{merged with}} Newcastle Breweries in 1960, forming Scottish & Newcastle, {{a group with}} market value of £50 million. William McEwan Younger, the son of William Younger, was the {{chairman}} and managing director. The company dedicated itself to the free trade, and promoted its brands to an extent not previously witnessed in the British brewing industry. McEwan's Export {{became one of the}} three core brands of the new company, alongside Newcastle Brown Ale and Younger's Tartan Special. Scottish & Newcastle became the dominant force in brewing across Scotland and the North of England. From the 1960s, the company began to style itself MacEwan's in export markets, in order to make pronunciation easier. The company's McEwan's Strong Ale was the highest gravity <b>beer</b> <b>on</b> general sale throughout the world. McEwan's Export was alternatively sold as India Pale Ale or Scotch Ale overseas. William McEwan Younger retired in 1970.|$|E

25|$|Security {{staff at}} many {{sporting}} venues frown on such behaviour, and will often attempt to confiscate the empty cups from people building a beer snake. This {{is in part}} due to the dangers of such structures in crowded places, and also {{due to the fact that}} the component cups are often not completely empty and will spill stale <b>beer</b> <b>on</b> spectators.|$|E
25|$|Cask ale in pubs {{is usually}} {{served with a}} beer engine or handpump, {{which is used to}} siphon the beer from the cellar. The beer engine is a , {{sometimes}} , airtight piston chamber; pulling down on the handle raises the piston which drags up a half pint of beer. When a cask is first tapped into the beer engine, or after the lines have been washed through, the pump needs to be pulled several times to clear the lines of air or water. The line will continue to hold beer, which will tend to go stale overnight, so the first beer of the day pulled through will be thrown away. Most pubs will pull through at least a pint of <b>beer</b> <b>on</b> each beer engine before they open, while others will wait for the first order of <b>beer</b> <b>on</b> that pump. Experienced bar staff will serve a pint with long, smooth, slow pulls of the pump handle, plus a short final pull to make sure the glass is full.|$|E
25|$|Before shooting, teams may dunk the ping pong balls into cups {{of water}} in order to wash off the balls. However, {{research}} has shown that the wash cups can still hold bacteria such as E. coli. To avoid any illness, many players put water in the cups instead of beer, keeping a separate <b>beer</b> <b>on</b> the side to drink from. In doing so, it removes the possibility of getting sick or drinking any dirt that may transfer from the ball into the cup.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{typically}} Danish {{contribution to the}} meals {{of the day is}} the traditional lunch or smørrebrød consisting of open sandwiches, usually on thinly sliced rugbrød.

The sandwiches are richly garnished with onion rings, radish slices, cucumbers, tomato slices, parsley, remoulade or mayonnaise. The meal is mostly accompanied by <b>beer,</b> <b>on</b> occassion also by shots of ice-cold snaps or akvavit.|$|E
25|$|The Irish {{element of}} Puerto Rico {{is very much}} in evidence. Their {{contributions}} to the archipelago's agricultural industry and in the fields of politics and education are highly notable. In the city of Bayamón, there is an urbanization called Irlanda Heights (Ireland Heights). For the last several years, the town of Luquillo has hosted a day-long Saint Patrick's Day festival which includes a Desfile de San Patricio (St. Patrick's Parade) honoring Ireland's chief patron saint. There are various Irish pubs around the island which also celebrate the holiday and serve the typical green colored <b>beer</b> <b>on</b> the occasion. Among them are Shannon's Irish Pub in San Juan, and Logan's Irish Pub in Río Piedras.|$|E
25|$|Beer pong, {{also known}} as Beirut, is a {{drinking}} game in which players throw a ping pong ball across a table {{with the intent of}} landing the ball in a cup of <b>beer</b> <b>on</b> the other end. The game typically consists of opposing teams of two or more players per side with 6 or 10 cups set up in a triangle formation on each side. Each team then takes turns attempting to shoot ping pong balls into the opponent's cups. If a ball lands in a cup (known as a 'make'), the contents of that cup are consumed by the other team and the cup is removed from the table. The first team to eliminate all of the opponent's cups is the winner.|$|E

25|$|Mergers {{with and}} sales to other breweries {{occurred}} over the years. A merger with competitor Portland Brewing brought the Blitz name into the formal name of the brewery. Arnold Blitz, who had owned Portland Brewing, became Chairman of the new Blitz-Weinhard company. The new company took 20 years to modernize the brewery and recover from Prohibition, which ended in 1933. In 1979, Blitz-Weinhard was sold to the Pabst Brewing Company. Pabst then sold the brewery to Stroh Brewing Company in 1996. The last and final sale of the company in 1999 had major effects on the brewery building. Stroh's sold the Henry Weinhard's brand to Miller Brewing Company, and moved all Henry's brewing operations to the Olympia Brewery in Tumwater, Washington. After nearly 135 years of continual operations, the Weinhard Brewery brewed its last <b>beer</b> <b>on</b> August 27, 1999. It was put up for sale the following month.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial was}} held in September 1955 and lasted for five days; {{attendees}} remembered that the weather was very hot. The courtroom was filled to capacity with 280 spectators; black attendees sat in segregated sections. Press from major national newspapers attended, including black publications; black reporters were required {{to sit in the}} segregated black section and away from the white press, farther from the jury. Sheriff Strider welcomed black spectators coming back from lunch with a cheerful, [...] "Hello, Niggers!" [...] Some visitors from the North found the court to be run with surprising informality. Jury members were allowed to drink <b>beer</b> <b>on</b> duty, and many white male spectators wore handguns.|$|E
500|$|On September 28, 2009, {{when the}} Angels celebrated winning the American League West division, they honored Adenhart by {{spraying}} champagne and <b>beer</b> <b>on</b> {{one of his}} jerseys, and then gathered {{in front of the}} outfield wall memorial for a team picture. The appropriateness of celebrating with alcohol in respect to Adenhart's death being alcohol-related was questioned, but family members were supportive of the celebrations. Adenhart's father Jim stated, [...] "That's baseball. If Nick were there, he'd have been throwing a few back as well." [...] Adenhart's teammates voted to give his family a full playoff share for the 2009 playoffs worth $138,038.57. Angels manager Mike Scioscia dedicated his 2009 American League Manager of the Year Award to Adenhart.|$|E
