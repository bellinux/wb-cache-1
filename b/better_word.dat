500|$|The {{film has}} come to be seen as the archetypal {{portrayal}} of 1980s excess, with Douglas advocating [...] "greed, for lack of a <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> is good". Wall Street defines itself through a number of morality conflicts putting wealth and power against simplicity and honesty, and an attack on the value system of extreme competitiveness where ethics and the law are simply irrelevant parts of the show.|$|E
500|$|Wall Street (1987) – The notorious [...] "corporate raider" [...] and [...] "greenmailer" [...] Gordon Gekko, {{representing}} {{a synthesis of}} the worst features of various famous private equity figures, intends to manipulate an ambitious young stockbroker {{to take over a}} failing but decent airline. [...] Although Gekko makes a pretense of caring about the airline, his intentions prove to be to destroy the airline, strip its assets and lay off its employees before raiding the corporate pension fund. [...] Gekko would become a symbol in popular culture for unrestrained greed (with the signature line, [...] "Greed, for lack of a <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> is good") that would be attached to the private equity industry.|$|E

500|$|The Bears {{failed to}} score 18 {{points for the}} first time in 2013, while {{allowing}} a season-high five sacks. Chicago also allowed two 100-yard rushers in the same game {{for the first time}} since 1976 against the Denver Broncos, with Norris Weese (120 yards) and Ottis Anderson (116 yards) guiding the Broncos to 28–14 win. After the game, Marc Trestman stated, [...] "We are a team that was ready to play this game and we played a terrible football game for lack of a <b>better</b> <b>word.</b> I'm not going to use any word other than that. We were terrible in all three phases. We didn't play well in any phase of football." ...|$|E
500|$|They {{knew little}} of the {{permanent}} effects of the war. Nine million had died and France lost more than any. But, as elsewhere, news was scant. Who even knew if {{there was still a}} road to Roubaix? If Roubaix was still there? The car of organisers and journalists made its way along the route those first riders had gone. And at first all looked well. There was destruction and there was poverty and there was a strange shortage of men. But France had survived. But then, as they neared the north, the air began to reek of broken drains, raw sewage and the stench of rotting cattle. Trees which had begun to look forward to spring became instead blackened, ragged stumps, their twisted branches pushed to the sky like the crippled arms of a dying man. Everywhere was mud. Nobody knows who first described it as 'hell', but there was no <b>better</b> <b>word.</b> And that's how it appeared next day in the papers: that little party had seen 'the hell of the north.' ...|$|E
500|$|Morley {{concludes that}} [...] "Anti-rockism was always violently pro-pop, largely because we {{original}} campaigning anti-rockists {{had been given}} such a tough time at school for liking [...] Bowie and [...] Bolan and not ELP and Led Zep." [...] Regarding the definition, music writer Ned Raggett noted: [...] "Every article, every discussion, anything which involves the word seems to get bogged down or get taken apart in ways which prevent there from being any consensus." [...] Accordingly, some people have used rockism as a polemical label to identify and critique a cluster of beliefs and assumptions in music criticism. Rockism is therefore not a connotatively neutral term, according to Raggett: [...] "You’re {{not going to find}} anyone arguing FOR [...] any time soon, or at least coming out and saying sobut that’s precisely because of the terms of the discourse." [...] Popmatters Robert Loss wrote that [...] "traditionalism" [...] describes the policing of the present with the past, making it a <b>better</b> <b>word</b> for [...] "rockism". Design critic and indie pop musician Nick Currie (aka Momus) compared rockism to the international art movement Stuckism, which holds that artists who do not paint or sculpt are not true artists.|$|E

500|$|Despite her {{physical}} {{absence from the}} entry, Cher's presence can be felt throughout the narrative. Negra argues that Cher's [...] "flamboyant and self-authored body" [...] {{is used as a}} metaphor for [...] "the possibility of self-transformation". In addition, her voice, heard via songs like [...] "Walking in Memphis", is associated with the idea of [...] "circumvent patriarchy." [...] Negra notes that Cher's music is used in scenes during The Great Mutato's sexual encounters with women. Negra asserts that [...] "this juxtaposition of sound and image cues our perception that we have entered the realm of carnival where the normal order of things is inverted." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club reasons that the ending was not the actual conclusion of the episode, but rather the fanciful and elaborate happy ending that was concocted by Izzy Berkowitz, the writer of the comic book, after talking to Mulder. In this manner, VanDerWeff notes, [...] "the episode abandons logic and reality and, for lack of a <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> transcends." [...] Meghan Deans from Tor.com postulates that the entire episode never happened [...] "rom a canonical perspective" [...] due to the entry's comic book setting, the various meta-references and the [...] "happy ending".|$|E
500|$|From {{conception}} {{to final}} release in 2009, drummer Aaron Harris {{estimates that the}} creation and execution of Wavering Radiant took {{about two and a}} half years. During the writing of the record, all of Isis' members were residing permanently within Los Angeles; a situation in contrast to their previous full-length, 2006's In the Absence of Truth; band members were divided between New York and Los Angeles throughout that album's inception and creation. The entire band felt a degree of dissatisfaction with In the Absence of Truth, and Harris felt that the logistical change was beneficial to the writing process, allowing for more time: [...] "rather than feeling like we had limited time to capture something, I felt like we could take our time with the songs, and come back the next day to work on things rather than in a few weeks". The resulting sound was described by guitarist Michael Gallagher as [...] "more live [...] a little bit dirtier – almost, for lack of a <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> sloppy. But in a good way. We spent a lot of time getting all of our takes as close to perfect as we could on previous records. On this one, we went more with the vibe of the particular take in question." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, noting that Test the Store' {{was just too}} dumb to build any further momentum; I wish I had a <b>better</b> <b>word</b> for it, but I just can't think of one." [...] However, McNutt appreciated Jim's presentation, noting that [...] "the final presentation was a pretty decent setpiece." [...] What Culture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer awarded the episode three out of five stars, noting that the episode fell victim to [...] "the overall lack of focus and believability that has plagued The Office all season." [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screen Crave gave the episode a review of seven out of ten, noting that [...] "The Office continues to get the comedy boost it needs from the Florida storyline." [...] Hyatt called the scene featuring Dwight and Jim imitating Kelly and Ryan's mom as [...] "one of my favorite moments of the season so far." [...] Despite this, he did call the episode [...] "uneven," [...] noting that the Scranton story-line was [...] "ho-hum." [...] Dan Forcella from TV Fanatic awarded the episode {{four out of five}} stars and praised Jim's presentation, writing, [...] "Between Jim's outfit and makeup, the fact that he embraced the presentation throughout, and all of the Chuck references, I was speechless {{by the end of that}} thing." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} criticized for its {{graphics}} and engine, which reviewers considered to be outdated. G4 called the engine [...] "old" [...] and [...] "clunky", and PC Format said that [...] "the whole thing {{is limited by the}} creaking engine." [...] However, certain sources praised the engine. Game Informer called it [...] "the best role-playing engine that has ever been invented," [...] and GameSpot said that [...] "'immortal' may be a <b>better</b> <b>word</b> to describe the engine, because the fact is, Icewind Dale II plays great." [...] In regards to the graphics, GameSpot said that [...] "in many ways Icewind Dale II represents the best use of the Infinity Engine's prerendered, isometric settings to date, [...] that doesn't change the fact that Icewind Dale II generally looks dated." [...] IGN thought the sprites had become out-dated, and that [...] "the animations are crude by today's standards." [...] New Straits Times agreed, saying that although some of the effects were attractive, the [...] "dated Infinity engine" [...] could not compare to contemporaries Dungeon Siege and Neverwinter Nights. However, Computer Gaming World believed that [...] "it consistently offers the same striking and imaginative environments that establish the tone and immersive charm of the game," [...] and Computer Games Magazine said, [...] "it may not look like much, but it's got it where it counts." [...] The game's pre-rendered backgrounds received praise. IGN said that [...] "the artwork is attractive, both conceptually and in its final form," [...] and Game Informer called them [...] "beautiful". Many reviewers complained about the game's pathfinding AI, which PC Zone called [...] "outrageously bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|They {{struck up}} one of those over and over strains {{that seem to have}} no {{beginning}} and certainly no ending at all. The strumming attained a disturbing monotony, but on and on it went, a kind of stuff associated with [...] cane rows and levee camps. Thump-thump-thump went their feet on the floor. It was not really annoying or unpleasant. Perhaps [...] "haunting" [...] is the <b>better</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E

But I used it for lack of a <b>better</b> <b>word.</b> Since then, I've been schooled by thousands of incest survivors all across the world that there really {{is no such thing as}} consensual incest due to the inherent power a parent has over a child. So, I wouldn't necessarily call it a consensual relationship at this time." ...|$|E
2500|$|When a piece first makes a capture, it promotes. (If it can: a few {{important}} pieces do not promote.) Promotion has {{the effect}} of changing how a piece moves. See the table above for what each piece promotes to. Promotion is effected by turning the piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its promoted rank. Promotion is both compulsory and permanent. Often [...] "demotion" [...] would be a <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> for most powerful pieces 'promote' to a gold general, which is a weak piece. It is the weaker pieces that tend to become more powerful upon making a capture.|$|E
