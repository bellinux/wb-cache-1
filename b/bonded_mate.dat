50|$|The Eld are {{a race of}} {{long-lived}} mortal beings {{ruled by}} powerful sorcerous Mages who devote their lives to mastering the darkest magics of the world. The Mages are ruled by the Mage Council, which is headed by the High Mage of Eld.

50|$|Sexual dichromatism is {{distinct}} in the Hainan gibbon. The males are all almost completely black, with sometimes white or buff cheeks. Females, conversely, are a golden or buff color with black patches, including {{a streak of}} black on the head. Both males and females are slender, with long {{arms and legs and}} no tail. The arms are used to swing from tree to tree, which is known as brachiation. The Hainan gibbon sings duets for <b>bonding</b> and <b>mating.</b>|$|R
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of animals mate more or less promiscuously. A few mammals, including humans, utilize more restrained mating strategies that entail a longer term affiliation with a single mating partner. Such pair <b>bonding</b> <b>mating</b> strategies have been resistant to genetic analysis {{because of a lack}} of suitable model organisms. Prairie voles are small mouse-like rodents that form enduring pair bonds in the wild as well as in the laboratory, and consequently they have been used widely to study social bonding behavior. The lack of targeted genetic approaches in this species however has restricted the study of the molecular and neural circuit basis of pair bonds. As a first step in rendering the prairie vole amenable to reverse genetics, we have generated induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSC) lines from prairie vole fibroblasts using retroviral transduction of reprogramming factors. These IPSC lines display the cellular and molecular hallmarks of IPSC cells from other organisms, including mice and humans. Moreover, the prairie vole IPSC lines have pluripotent differentiation potential since they can give rise to all three germ layers in tissue culture and in vivo. These IPSC lines can now be used to develop conditions that facilitate homologous recombination and eventually the generation of prairie voles bearing targete...|$|R

50|$|Like {{other members}} of Meles, Japanese badgers are nocturnal and {{hibernate}} during the coldest months of the year. Beginning at 2 years of age, females mate and give birth to litters {{of two or three}} cubs in the spring (March-April). They mate again shortly afterwards, but delay implantation until the following February. Japanese badgers are more solitary than European badgers; they do not aggregate into social clans, and mates do not form pair <b>bonds.</b> During <b>mating</b> season, the range of a male badger overlaps with those of 2 to 3 females.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe studied {{copulation}} behaviour of the osprey, Pandion haliaetus, a semicolonial, fish-eating raptor, in Corsica (Mediterranean). Pairs copulated over a {{long period}} (45 days) and at a high rate, with, on average, 288 within-pair copulations (WPCs) for a clutch. Pairs breeding at higher density faced more frequent territorial intrusions than others and were potentially at an increased cuckoldry risk. However, and contrary to predictions of the ‘paternity assurance' hypothesis for frequent copulations, we found that WPC rate decreased with increasing frequency of territorial intrusions. Male territory attendance increased with territorial intrusion frequency, {{to the detriment of the}} food provisioning of the female. Both attempted and successful WPC rates were positively related to the amount of food delivered by the male. Thus, the more frequent the territorial intrusions, the more time the male spent within his territory, the less he courtship fed and the smaller the fish he delivered, and the less the pair copulated successfully. WPC rate was also higher in newly formed pairs than in established pairs, and decreased with increasing pair bond length. The results suggest that males rely on mate guarding rather than frequent copulations to ensure paternity, and do not support the idea that sperm competition is the main cause of frequent WPCs. Nonfertilization functions of frequent copulations, such as pair <b>bonding,</b> <b>mate</b> assessment and mate retention, were likely early in the prelaying period. The findings that WPC rate decreased with mate fidelity and that females traded copulations for food suggest that mate retention was a possible function of frequent copulations in this species...|$|R
25|$|Promiscuity {{is common}} in many animal species. Some species have {{promiscuous}} mating systems, ranging from polyandry and polygyny to mating systems with no stable relationships where mating between two individuals is a one-time event. Many species form stable pair <b>bonds,</b> but still <b>mate</b> with other individuals outside the pair. In biology, incidents of promiscuity in species that form pair bonds are usually called extra-pair copulations.|$|R
50|$|One {{study has}} {{suggested}} that genetic variation in male humans affects pair-bonding behavior. The brain of males uses vasopressin {{as a reward for}} forming lasting <b>bonds</b> with a <b>mate,</b> and men with {{one or two of the}} genetic alleles are more likely to experience marital discord. The partners of the men with two of the alleles affecting vasopressin reception state disappointing levels of satisfaction, affection, and cohesion.|$|R
50|$|The {{parakeet auklet}} {{is a highly}} vocal species at the nest, calling once it arrives at the nest and then duetting once its mate arrives. It makes a series of rhythmic hoarse calls (like that of the Cassin's auklet) and a quavering squeal. The {{function}} of these are unknown, but could be associated with defending its burrow from intruders and strengthening the <b>bond</b> with its <b>mate.</b>|$|R

50|$|Typically nocturnal (active mainly at night), the klipspringer rests {{during the}} middle of the day and late at night. A gregarious animal, the klipspringer is monogamous to a much greater extent than other antelopes; {{individuals}} of opposite sexes exhibit long-term to lifelong pair <b>bonding.</b> The <b>mates</b> tend to stay as close as within 5 m of each other at most times. Males form territories, 7.5 - 49 ha, in which they stay with their partners and offspring. Primarily a browser, the klipspringer prefers young plants, fruits and flowers. Gestation lasts around six months, following which a single calf is born; births peak from spring to early summer. The calf leaves its mother when it turns a year old.|$|R
50|$|Since {{sexual desire}} {{increases}} {{attraction to the}} object of one’s desire, this motivates prolonged closeness with the other individual. By extension close proximity {{increases the likelihood of}} stronger affectional bonds to form between sexual partners as opposed to platonic friends. However, due to the functional independence of sexual desire and love, humans may <b>mate</b> without <b>bonding</b> or may <b>bond</b> without <b>mating.</b> Affectional <b>bonds</b> are generally a product of high levels of close proximity and physical contact with individuals over time. Sufficient time spent together, and forms of touch allow for the development of this pair-bonding, and though sexual desire may promote closeness, alone it does not characterize romantic love. Affectional bonds are characterized by feelings of infatuation and emotional attachment.|$|R
25|$|Most hamsters are {{strictly}} solitary. If housed together, acute and chronic stress may occur, {{and they may}} fight fiercely, sometimes fatally. Dwarf hamster species may tolerate conspecifics. Russian hamsters form close, monogamous <b>bonds</b> with their <b>mates,</b> and if separated, they may become very depressed. This happens especially in males. Males will become inactive, eat more, and even show some behavioral changes similar to some types of depression in humans. This can even cause obesity in the hamster.|$|R

25|$|A {{male and}} female macaque form a pair <b>bond</b> and <b>mate,</b> feed, rest, and travel together, and this {{typically}} lasts 16 days on average during the mating season. Females enter into consortships {{with an average of}} four males a season. Higher-ranking males have longer consortships than their subordinates. In addition, higher-ranking males try to disrupt consortships of lower-ranking males. Females attempt to mate with males of any rank. However, dominant males mate more as they are more successful in mate guarding. The female decides whether mating takes place. In addition, dominance does not mean a male will successfully mate with a female. Males may also temporarily join another troop during the mating season and mate with the females. Females also engage in same-sex mounting. Such behavior is likely because of hormones and females are mounted more often by other females than males.|$|R
40|$|Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) {{exhibit a}} monogamous mating system {{characterized}} by long-term pair <b>bonds</b> between <b>mates.</b> The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the effect of cohabitation time and sexual experience on the devcl-opment of pair bond formation in female prairie voles. Females that were allowed to cohabit for 24 hr or more, with or without mating, exhibited a strong social preference for a familiar partner versus a strange male. Females that cohabited and mated for 6 hr showed strong preferences for a familiar partner, while cohabitation for less than 24 hr. without mating, did not result in preferences for the familiar male. These results indicate that mating was not essential for partner preference formation; however, preferences developed more rapidly when mating occurred. % lY 92 Academic Press. Inc.

40|$|Many animals {{adjust their}} {{signaling}} patterns throughout the year. Birds may use different signals as they increase association with mates and expend more energy in territory defense. Song is {{typically associated with}} territorial defense and pair <b>bonding</b> between <b>mates,</b> while calls often relate to maintaining contact between foraging birds. We studied variations in vocal behavior in canyon wrens (Catherpes mexicanus) by recording a pair across the midwinter-early spring transition preceding nesting. Recordings were made {{at the same time}} weekly for 10 weeks. Call rate decreased during this period, contrasting strongly with increasing song production. The occurrence of low frequency vocalizations following songs also increased, which may serve as an aggressive signal in territory defense. Behavior observations coupled with the recording results indicate that canyon wrens alter their vocal communication with the shift into the breeding season. These changes likely correlate with increased need for strong partnership and territorial resources...|$|R
5|$|Several {{types of}} cricket songs {{are in the}} {{repertoire}} of some species. The calling song attracts females and repels other males, and is fairly loud. The courting song is used when a female cricket is near and encourages her to mate with the caller. A triumphal song is produced {{for a brief period}} after a successful mating, and may reinforce the <b>mating</b> <b>bond</b> to encourage the female to lay some eggs rather than find another male. An aggressive song is triggered by contact chemoreceptors on the antennae that detect the presence of another male cricket.|$|R
50|$|Adult-adult pair bond {{formation}} - Oxytocin and vasopressin {{play a crucial}} part {{in the process of}} <b>bond</b> formation of <b>mates.</b> Vasopressin is a peptide hormone whose main function is to retain water in the body, and is also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Pair bonding is studied using voles and it has been found that injection of both hormones stimulates the behavioral responses needed in pair {{bond formation}}, even when mating hasn't occurred. These results are also proven when injection of receptor antagonists of this hormones inhibits mating and necessary behaviors.|$|R

25|$|Women {{married to}} more possessive, {{controlling}} or jealous husbands {{are more likely}} to be unfaithful as well. Women who experience this type of behaviour from their partners {{are more likely to}} show mate guarding resistance particularly by using covert tactics. Females pair <b>bonded</b> with <b>mates</b> who have higher digit span ratios who have previously cheated are also more likely to resist mate guarding. Digit span ratio is a sexually dimorphic trait and male humans generally have lower ratios. This means their ring finger/fourth finger is usually longer than their index/second finger. It is suggested that this relates to the risks involved with mate guarding resistance and the aggression of the male. In those with higher digit span ratios their index finger is longer than their ring finger. Higher digit span ratios often mean the male has less testosterone and may act less aggressively because of this, meaning the risks of mate guarding resistance for females is lower.|$|R
