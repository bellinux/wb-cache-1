In this work, MCSA and vibration analysis are applied to induction motor to detect outer raceway defects in faulty <b>bearings.</b> <b>Data</b> acquisition, record-ing, and fast fourier transform (FFT) algorithms are done by using the LabVIEW programming language. Experimental results verify the relationship between vibra-tion analysis and MCSA, and identify the presence of outer raceway bearing defects in induction machines. This work also indicates that detecting fault frequencies by motor currents is more difficult than detecting them by vibration analysis. The use of intensive resolution FFT is recommended in MCSA for detecting faults easily. Reinstalling a faulty bearing can alter the characteristic frequencies and it is diffi-cult to compare results from different bearings or even from the same bearing in different installations...|$|R

The challenge datasets were characterized by a small amount of training data and a high variability in experiment durations (from 1h to 7h). Thereby, performing good estimates was quite di cult and this made the challenge more exciting.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel application of circular domain features calculation based condition monitoring method for low rotational speed slewing bearing. The method employs data reduction process using piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA) to detect frequency alteration in the bearing signal when the fault occurs.

It is shown that the slight changes of bearing condition during operation can be identified more clearly in circular domain analysis compared to time domain analysis and other advanced signal processing methods such as wavelet decomposition and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) allowing the engineer to better schedule the maintenance work. Four circular domain features were shown to consistently and clearly identify the onset (initiation) of fault from the peak feature value which is not clearly observable in time domain features.

40|$|Bearing {{vibration}} response {{studies are}} {{crucial for the}} condition monitoring of bearings and the quality inspection of rotating machinery systems. However, it is still very difficult to diagnose bearing faults, especially rolling element faults, due to the complex, high-dimensional and nonlinear characteristics of vibration signals {{as well as the}} strong background noise. A novel nonlinear analysis method—the symplectic entropy (SymEn) measure—is proposed to analyze the measured signals for fault monitoring of rolling bearings. The core technique of the SymEn approach is the entropy analysis based on the symplectic principal components. The dynamical characteristics of the rolling <b>bearing</b> <b>data</b> are analyzed using the SymEn method. Unlike other techniques consisting of high-dimensional features in the time-domain, frequency-domain and the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) /wavelet-domain, the SymEn approach constructs low-dimensional (i. e., two-dimensional) features based on the SymEn estimate. The vibration signals from our experiments and the Case Western Reserve University <b>Bearing</b> <b>Data</b> Center are applied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Meanwhile, it is found that faulty bearings have a great influence on the other normal bearings.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a combined method of the probability approach and {{support vector machine}} (SVM) to predict failure degradation based on simulated and experimental failure <b>bearing</b> <b>data.</b> The failure rate as a degradation parameter is calculated using the Cox-proportional hazard model and the reliability theory based on simulated and experimental data. Kurtosis is used to show the bearing condition under specified operating conditions up to final failure occurrence. For simulated data, a failure degradation is calculated using the Cox model, where the baseline hazard is assumed having Weibull probability. In the case of experimental data, a reliability formula is employed to estimate the failure degradation of the bearing based on run-to-failure datasets. Both failure degradations are regarded as target vectors which indicate the bearing health to failure condition. Moreover, an SVM is employed as an artificial intelligence prognostics method and trained by kurtosis and the target vector to build the prediction model.

40|$|The {{rolling element}} bearing is a core {{component}} of many systems such as aircraft, train, steamboat, and machine tool, and their failure can lead to reduced capability, downtime, and even catastrophic breakdowns. Due to misoperation, manufacturing deficiencies, {{or the lack of}} monitoring and maintenance, it is often found to be the most unreliable component within these systems. Therefore, effective and efficient fault diagnosis of {{rolling element bearing}}s has an important role in ensuring the continued safe and reliable operation of their host systems. This study presents a trace ratio criterion-based kernel discriminant analysis (TR-KDA) for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings. The binary immune genetic algorithm (BIGA) is employed to solve the trace ratio problem in TR-KDA.
