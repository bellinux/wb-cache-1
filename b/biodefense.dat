25|$|Daschle {{also served}} as a {{panelist}} on the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on <b>Biodefense,</b> a body that recommended changes to U.S. policy to strengthen national <b>biodefense.</b> In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on <b>Biodefense</b> created a 33 step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Headed by former Senator Joe Lieberman and former Governor Tom Ridge, the Study Panel assembled in Washington D.C. for four meetings concerning current <b>biodefense</b> programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, The National Blueprint for <b>Biodefense,</b> proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the Vice President authority over <b>biodefense</b> responsibilities and merging the entire <b>biodefense</b> budget. These solutions represent the Panel's call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues.|$|E

25|$|Bruce Edwards Ivins (April 22, 1946– July 29, 2008) was an American microbiologist, vaccinologist, senior <b>biodefense</b> {{researcher}} at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick, Maryland, and the key suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks.|$|E
25|$|Ivins was a {{scientist}} for 36 years and senior <b>biodefense</b> {{researcher at the}} United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Fort Detrick, Maryland for 18 years. After conducting research on Legionella and cholera, in 1979, Ivins {{turned his attention to}} anthrax after the anthrax outbreak in the Soviet city of Sverdlovsk (now known as Yekaterinburg), which killed at least 105 after an accidental release at a military facility.|$|E
25|$|Experts at the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian <b>Biodefense</b> Strategies (CCBS) {{concluded}} {{that one of}} the nineteen 9/11 hijackers, Ahmed al-Haznawi, had likely been exposed to anthrax. al-Haznawi and another man arrived in the emergency room of a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, hospital presenting an ugly, dark lesion on his leg that he said he developed after bumping into a suitcase two months earlier. Christos Tsonas thought the injury was curious, cleaned it and prescribed an antibiotic. After September 11, federal investigators found the medicine prescribed by Tsonas among the possessions of al-Haznawi.|$|E
25|$|The goal of <b>biodefense</b> is to {{integrate}} the sustained efforts of the national and homeland security, medical, public health, intelligence, diplomatic, and law enforcement communities. Health care providers and public health officers are among the first lines of defense. In some countries private, local, and provincial (state) capabilities are being augmented by and coordinated with federal assets, to provide layered defenses against biological weapon attacks. During the first Gulf War the United Nations activated a biological and chemical response team, Task Force Scorpio, to respond to any potential use {{of weapons of mass}} destruction on civilians.|$|E

2500|$|On August 1, 2008, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Bruce E. Ivins, 62, {{who worked for}} the past eighteen years at the government's bio defense labs at Fort Detrick, had apparently committed suicide. Ivins was a top U.S. <b>biodefense</b> researcher who worked at Ft. Detrick. It was widely reported the FBI was about to lay charges on him, but the evidence was largely circumstantial and the grand jury in Washington reported it was not ready to issue an indictment. Rep. Rush Holt, who represents the district where the anthrax letters were mailed, said circumstantial evidence was not enough and asked FBI Director Robert S. Mueller to appear before Congress to provide an account of the investigation. Ivins's death leaves two unanswered puzzles. Scientists familiar with germ warfare said {{there was no evidence that}} he had the skills to turn anthrax into an inhalable powder. According to Alan Zelicoff who aided the F.B.I. investigation [...] "I don't think a vaccine specialist could do it ... This is aerosol physics, not biology".|$|E
2500|$|In a {{technical}} article {{to be published}} in the Journal of Bioterrorism & <b>Biodefense</b> in 2011, three scientists argued that the preparation of the spores did require a high level of sophistication, contrary to the position taken by federal authorities that the material would have been unsophisticated. The paper is largely based on the high level of tin detected in tests of the mailed anthrax, and the tin may have been used to encapsulate the spores, which required processing not possible in laboratories to which Ivins had access. According to the scientific article, this raises the possibility that Ivins was not the perpetrator or did not act alone. Earlier in the investigation, the FBI had named tin as a substance [...] "of interest" [...] but the final report makes no mention of it and fails to address the high tin content. The chairwoman of the National Academy of Science panel that reviewed the FBI's scientific work and the director of a separate review by the Government Accountability Office said that the issues raised by the paper should be addressed. Other scientists, such as Johnathan L. Kiel, a retired Air Force scientist who worked on anthrax for many years, did not agree with the authors' assessments – saying that the tin might be a random contaminant rather than a clue to complex processing. Kiel said that tin might simply be picked up by the spores {{as a result of the}} use of metal lab containers, although he had not tested that idea.|$|E
2500|$|On April 22, 2010, the U.S. National Research Council, the {{operating}} {{arm of the}} National Academy of Sciences, convened a review committee that heard testimony from Henry Heine, a microbiologist who was formerly employed at the Army's <b>biodefense</b> laboratory in Maryland where Ivins had worked. Heine told the panel {{that it was impossible}} that the deadly spores had been produced undetected in Ivins's laboratory, as maintained by the F.B.I. He testified that using the equipment at the army lab, at least a year of intensive work would have been required to produce the quantity of spores contained in the letters, and that such an intensive effort could not have escaped the attention of colleagues. Heine also told the panel that lab technicians who worked closely with Ivins have told him they saw no such work. He stated further that where Ivins worked biological containment measures were inadequate to prevent the Anthrax spores from floating out of the laboratory into animal cages and offices. [...] "You'd have had dead animals or dead people," [...] Heine said. According to Science Magazine, [...] "Heine caveated his remarks by saying that he himself had no experience making anthrax stocks." [...] Science magazine provides additional comments by Adam Driks of Loyola who stated that the amount of anthrax in the letters could be made in [...] "a number of days". Emails by Ivins state, [...] "We can presently make 1 X 10^12 [...] spores per week." [...] And The New York Times reported on May 7, 2002, that the Leahy letter contained [...]871grams of anthrax powder ...|$|E
