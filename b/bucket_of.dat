5|$|The {{film was}} {{partially}} cast with stock actors that Corman had used in previous films. Writer Charles B. Griffith portrays several small roles. Griffith's father {{appears as a}} dental patient, and his grandmother, Myrtle Vail, appears as Seymour's hypochondriac mother. Dick Miller, who had starred as the protagonist of A <b>Bucket</b> <b>of</b> Blood was offered the role of Seymour, but turned it down, instead taking the smaller role of Burson Fouch. Production at the <b>Bucket</b> <b>of</b> Blood sets was compressed into three days of cast rehearsals, immediately followed by two days and one night of principal photography.|$|E

5|$|Bart and Lisa {{begin to}} hear strange noises {{coming from the}} attic. Homer claims not {{to know what they}} are talking about, even though he is seen heading into the attic with a <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and {{discover}} there really is a monster. Homer and Marge go into the attic, and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a twin brother named Hugo. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained in the attic, where Homer fed him a <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to the attic and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert bursts in and knocks out Hugo. He then realizes that Hugo's scar is on the wrong side, and Bart is the evil twin. In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family sit down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked in the attic.|$|E

5|$|The film stars Jonathan Haze, Jackie Joseph, Mel Welles, and Dick Miller, all of {{whom had}} worked for Corman on {{previous}} films. Produced under the title The Passionate People Eater, the film employs an original style of humor, combining black comedy with farce and incorporating Jewish humor and elements of spoof.

5|$|Although Jerry Lawler and Doink the Clown had a storyline rivalry that dated {{back to when}} Doink {{turned on}} Lawler by dumping a <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> water on him after SummerSlam 1993, the feud had rarely been {{mentioned}} since then. On the September 10, 1994 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, however, Lawler provoked Doink by popping balloons carried by Doink's midget sidekick Dink. The rivalry soon led to Lawler introducing a midget named Queasy, who dressed like Lawler. Doink and Lawler then introduced many more midgets over the following weeks. An elimination match was booked for Survivor Series, with Lawler, Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy facing Doink, Dink, Wink and Pink.|$|E
5|$|The film's musical score, {{written by}} cellist Fred Katz, was {{originally}} written for A <b>Bucket</b> <b>of</b> Blood.

The score was used in a total of seven films, including The Wasp Woman and Creature from the Haunted Sea. Katz explained that his music for the film was created by a music editor piecing together selections from other soundtracks that he had produced for Corman.|$|E

Glinda travels to Elphaba's castle to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy go. Elphaba refuses until she suddenly receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died.

5|$|The branch was {{included}} in the Beeching report of 1963 which concluded that, since 30% of the railway network carried less than 1% of the total passenger traffic, much of it should be closed. The residents of Newport Pagnell resisted the closure, demanding an enquiry which took place on 7 June 1964. Despite many objections, it was determined that the line would close. The last passenger service was the 5:34 pm train from Newport Pagnell on 5 September 1964, just under a century after the line opened to passengers. The mourning of the line was so great that a <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> water was poured over a double dressed as Richard Beeching, the man commonly associated with the closure of over 4,000 miles of the British railway network. The crowd cheered as this happened, a mark of the public's feelings about the closure.|$|E
