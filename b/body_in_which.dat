500|$|Although care of {{offspring}} {{is poorly}} understood in frogs, [...] {{up to an}} estimated 20% of amphibian species may care for their young in some way. The evolution of parental care in frogs is driven primarily {{by the size of}} the water <b>body</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they breed. Those that breed in smaller water bodies tend to have greater and more complex parental care behaviour. Because predation of eggs and larvae is high in large water bodies, some frog species started to lay their eggs on land. Once this happened, the desiccating terrestrial environment demands that one or both parents keep them moist to ensure their survival. The subsequent need to transport hatched tadpoles to a water body required an even more intense form of parental care.|$|E

2500|$|Bilirubin (formerly {{referred}} to as haematoidin and discovered by Rudolf Virchow in 1847) is a yellow compound that occurs in the normal catabolic pathway that breaks down heme in vertebrates. This catabolism is a necessary process in the body's clearance of waste products that arise from the destruction of aged red blood cells. First the hemoglobin gets stripped of the heme molecule which thereafter passes through various processes of porphyrin catabolism, depending {{on the part of}} the <b>body</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the breakdown occurs. For example, the molecules excreted in the urine differ from those in the faeces. The production of biliverdin from heme is the first major step in the catabolic pathway, after which the enzyme biliverdin reductase performs the second step, producing bilirubin from biliverdin.|$|E

There are two Heads of College, two Heads of Arts (social), two Heads of Non-Residents and two Heads of Divinity; in each case, one Head is female and one male. Currently, the TCM Chair is Leila Martin, the Co-Heads of College are Bardia Monavari and Victoria Lin, the Co-Heads of Arts are Julianne de Gara and Lukas Weese, the Co-heads of Non-Residence Affairs are Katrina Li and Mitchell Nader, and the Head of Divinity is Adam Brown.|$|E
2500|$|Secondary {{lymphedema}} affects {{both men}} and women.

In Western countries, secondary lymphedema is most commonly due to cancer treatment. Between 38 and 89% of breast cancer patients suffer from lymphedema due to axillary lymph node dissection and/or radiation. Unilateral lymphedema occurs in up to 41% of patients after gynecologic cancer. For men, a 5-66% incidence of lymphedema has been reported in patients treated with incidence depending on whether staging or radical removal of lymph glands was done in addition to radiotherapy.|$|E

The rate of stylistic development between about 750 and 300 BC was remarkable by ancient standards, and in surviving works is best seen in sculpture. There were important innovations in painting, which have to be essentially reconstructed {{due to the lack}} of original survivals of quality, other than the distinct field of painted pottery. Greek architecture, technically very simple, established a harmonious style with numerous detailed conventions that were largely adopted by Roman architecture and are still followed in some modern buildings. [...] It used a vocabulary of ornament that was shared with pottery, metalwork and other media, and had an enormous influence on Eurasian art, especially after Buddhism carried it beyond the expanded Greek world created by Alexander the Great. [...] The social context of Greek art included radical political developments and a great increase in prosperity; the equally impressive Greek achievements in philosophy, literature and other fields are well known.|$|E
2500|$|A full {{redesign}} of all athletics logos and marks was commissioned in 1998, replacing the [...] "angry wave" [...] and [...] "wavy T" [...] designs {{with a green}} and blue oblique T crested by a foamy wave.

2500|$|After {{he became}} pope in 1978, John Paul II {{continued}} on the Catholic Theology of the Body {{of his predecessors}} {{with a series of}} lectures, entitled Theology of the <b>Body,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he talked about an original unity between man and women, purity of heart (on the Sermon on the Mount), marriage and celibacy and reflections on Humane vitae, focusing largely on responsible parenthood and marital chastity. John Paul II readdressed some of the same issues in his 1993 encyclical Veritatis splendor. He reaffirmed much of Humanae vitae, and specifically described the practice of artificial contraception as an act not permitted by Catholic teaching in any circumstances. The same encyclical also clarifies the use of conscience in arriving at moral decisions, including in the use of contraception. However, John Paul also said, “It is not right then to regard the moral conscience of the individual and the magisterium of the Church as two contenders, as two realities in conflict. The authority which the magisterium enjoys by the will of Christ exists so that the moral conscience can attain the truth with security and remain in it.” John Paul quoted Humanae vitae as a compassionate encyclical, [...] "Christ has come not to judge the world but to save it, and while he was uncompromisingly stern towards sin, he was patient and rich in mercy towards sinners".|$|E

Judah had reclaimed the IBF title two months earlier against Kaizer Mabuza. Khan was unhappy that a fight with Bradley could not be made. He said, [...] "Bradley was the guy I wanted to fight but he chickened out. I offered him 50% of UK revenue, which is unheard of, and 50% of all revenue in America, that's how much I wanted to fight him, but he didn't want it." [...] The fight was broadcast on Primetime in UK and HBO in USA. Khan started the fight with a left jab. Round 1 saw a busy Amir Khan as he fought from the outside and kept Judah away with jabs and straights. All four rounds were taken by Khan. Ultimately on the fifth round Zab was taken down with a right uppercut to the <b>body,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> at first commentators believed it was a low blow, since Judah was showing signs of agonising pain, {{but when it was}} seen from a different camera angle, it was right on the belt, leading to an 18th knockout for Khan in his career so far. Khan later rejected claims for the low blow saying, [...] "He went down. It was above the belt. Zab's a great fighter. I respect him a lot. But it was nowhere near below [...] It was a great shot." [...] Over 5 rounds, Khan landed 61 of 284 total punches (21%) and Judah landed 20 of 115 (17%). For the fight, Khan earned $1,072,500 and Judah had a $500,000 purse. The fight averaged 1.4 million viewers on HBO.|$|E
