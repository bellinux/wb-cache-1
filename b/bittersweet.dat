5|$|Numerous {{invasive}} plants live {{along the}} Saw Mill River. Porcelain berry is a vine with white berries that wraps around native trees and strangles them. Oriental <b>bittersweet</b> is also present along the river, {{and it is}} slowly displacing the native American <b>bittersweet.</b> Oriental bitterweet can also form hybrids with the native <b>bittersweet</b> and making identification harder. Japanese honeysuckle and Japanese knotweed are two other invasive vines native to Asia. In addition, purple loosestrife, a perennial herb with magenta flower stalks, is also present along the river.|$|E

5|$|The final episode {{received}} a largely positive response, with reviewers praising it for its sentimental, <b>bittersweet</b> way of concluding the show.|$|E
5|$|Solanum cornutum (buffalo-bur), Solanum nigrum (black nightshade), Solanum melongena (eggplant or aubergine), Solanum dulcamara (<b>bittersweet</b> nightshade), Solanum luteum (hairy nightshade), Solanum tuberosum (potato), and Solanum elaeagnifolium (silverleaf nightshade). They {{are also}} {{associated}} with other plants in this family, namely the species Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) and the genus Capsicum (pepper).|$|E
5|$|Gwyneth Herbert {{talked to}} Claire Martin about her album <b>Bittersweet</b> and Blue on BBC Radio 3's Jazz Line-Up on 12 February 2005 and was interviewed about her career on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour on 28 November 2007. On 13 December 2013, with Frances Ruffelle, Isy Suttie and Neil Marcus, she talked with Tom Service on his BBC Radio 3 {{programme}} Music Matters {{about the development}} of musical theatre and The A–Z of Mrs P.|$|E
5|$|Among {{her most}} famous roles were Anna Leonowens {{in the film}} version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I (1956); and {{opposite}} Cary Grant as his shipboard romantic interest Terri McKay in the <b>bittersweet</b> love story An Affair to Remember (1957). She reunited with Grant and Mitchum for a sophisticated comedy, The Grass Is Greener (1960), and then joined Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra in a love triangle for a romantic comedy, Marriage on the Rocks (1965). In 1966, the producers of Carry On Screaming! offered her a fee comparable to that paid {{to the rest of the}} cast combined, but she turned it down in favor of appearing in an aborted stage version of Flowers for Algernon.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to higher}} {{elevation}} and precipitation, {{the ecology of}} the Black Hills differs significantly from that of the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by coniferous needleleaf evergreens: various types of pines—including ponderosa (covering , or 80% of the Black Hills forest), lodgepole, white, and timber—as well as western red cedar and spruces. Western yellow ponderosa is the most important lumber tree in the area. The South Dakota state tree is the Black Hills spruce. The Red Valley is home to blue-joint and bluegrasses, and wild plum, Juneberry, and chokecherry shrubs grow in the Hills. Violets, thistles, and horse mint are prevalent herbs. Vines grow widely: the woodbine, <b>bittersweet,</b> and wild grape, which is the pattern for Black Hills gold jewelry.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the minor themes in the B strain, the third section is upbeat but with <b>bittersweet</b> harmonies, returning once again to the scale of B-flat major. Here, for the first time, the piece departs from the standard left-hand pattern that characterizes most ragtime. This section of the piece {{has been compared to}} the style of twelve bar blues. The C strain also represents the only known time when Joplin departs from the standard sixteen-bar form, being instead 24 bars in length with an uneven 14- and 10-bar division. Its first 12 measures parallel the 12-bar blues form and the next two measures extend the subdominant as a transition into the last ten bars.|$|E
5|$|Balukas was {{not just}} talented at pool but was an {{all-around}} good athlete. Starting at age 16, and for two other years, she was {{invited to participate in}} ABC-TV's Superstars. Held in Rotonda, Florida, the event pitted championship athletes from one sport competing in sports other than their own specialties, vying for cash prizes totaling $69,000. In her first appearance in 1976, while a junior in high school, she finished second taking titles in tennis and bowling where she won with 192 points. The winner that year was speed skater Anne Henning. Other competitors included, diver Micki King, tennis and golf pro Althea Gibson, Skier Kiki Cutter, sprinter Wyomia Tyus, and Tennis champ Martina Navratilova. The second place win was <b>bittersweet</b> for Balukas, because based on the award of prize money for placing at Superstars ($13,100), she lost amateur standing and was thereafter banned from competing in high school sports, also becoming no longer eligible for a college athletic scholarship.|$|E
5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a <b>bittersweet</b> feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
5|$|In {{selecting}} Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, {{the selection}} committee {{operating under the}} Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction {{of the novel is}} that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she hardly knew she possessed. With <b>bittersweet</b> irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With its almost cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for what goes on in people's minds, especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society. It is not just Bang's portrayal of a bygone provincial world that seems so typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow, starring Tammi Øst as Katinka.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that year}} in 1932, Dallas' sister Eve {{searches}} for Dallas, putting her {{at odds with}} the Gandor family. These stories involved the Daily Days News Information company and the Runorattas' drug plot with Begg, a drug addicted immortal alchemist acquaintance of Maiza's encroaching Gandor turf through his miracle drugs, testing it on innocent bystanders including a young man named Roy Maddock. Eventually Eve is caught up in the turf war involving drugs with the Runoratta family and Gandors, the ramifications of the turf war affecting two lovers: Gandor speakeasy waitress Edith and her boyfriend, revealed to be Roy. The climax of the conflict results in Luck secretly telling Eve where Dallas is to spare her from bloodshed, and with Claire's help, the turf war ends with <b>bittersweet</b> results for Edith and Roy now associated with the Gandors until they finish the debt they compiled in the story albeit in happier terms.|$|E

25|$|<b>Bittersweet</b> World debuted {{at number}} four on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling about 47,000 copies {{in its first}} week. This was a much weaker debut than those enjoyed by Autobiography (398,000 copies) and I Am Me (220,000 copies), both of which debuted at number one. In the U.S., <b>Bittersweet</b> World has sold 126,000 copies, {{according}} to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E

25|$|A bitters is {{traditionally}} an alcoholic preparation flavored with botanical matter {{such that the}} end result is characterized by a bitter, sour, or <b>bittersweet</b> flavor. Numerous longstanding brands of bitters were originally developed as patent medicines, but are now sold as digestifs and cocktail flavorings.|$|E
25|$|Oriental <b>bittersweet,</b> a vine which {{kills the}} trees in buffer forests by {{wrapping}} itself tightly around them, has also been observed in some areas. The stream management plan recommends that a comprehensive plan be developed for controlling and eradicating both species, and any others that {{may be found in}} the future.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} City of New Orleans {{began in}} 1947 {{as part of}} the Illinois Central Railroad, and was the longest daylight run in the United States. The daylight train under that name ran through 1971. It is the subject of the <b>bittersweet</b> 1971 song City of New Orleans (song), written by Steve Goodman.|$|E
25|$|But {{there was}} such a <b>bittersweet</b> feeling. Eddie had really changed. Paul was on his last legs. Watch the clip of us doing the song on Ed Sullivan we're not together. Eddie is off by himself. There was no more group. Sure enough, when we played the Copa that week, Eddie left between shows. He didn't come back.|$|E
25|$|Best Worst Thing That Ever Could Have Happened (2016): Documentary from {{original}} Merrily We Roll Along {{cast member}} Lonny Price. It tells the <b>bittersweet</b> {{story of the}} 1981 Sondheim-Furth-Prince flop Merrily We Roll Along using both film footage taken during rehearsal for the original Broadway production, and new interviews with its cast and creators.|$|E
25|$|While {{many blacks}} were happy over McDaniel's {{personal}} victory, they also {{viewed it as}} <b>bittersweet.</b> They believed Gone With the Wind celebrated the slave system and condemned the forces that destroyed it. For them, the unique accolade McDaniel had won suggested that only {{those who did not}} protest Hollywood's systemic use of racial stereotypes could find work and success there.|$|E
25|$|Cuntapay {{played a}} fictionalized version {{of herself in}} the indie mockumentary Six Degrees of Separation from Lilia Cuntapay—described as a <b>bittersweet</b> fictional account on Cuntapay's life as a Philippine showbiz extra, an entry to the 2011 Cinema One Originals and {{directed}} by Antoinette H. Jadaone. The film won six awards in the 2011 Cinema One Originals Digital Film Festival, including a Best Actress award for Cuntapay.|$|E
25|$|Terrestrial {{wildlife}} includes beavers, tree frogs, and raccoons among others. Additionally, {{the park}} is home to some bats. Aquatic life in the creek includes crawfish, freshwater mussels, and some smaller fish. Snowberry, Pacific dogwood, Douglas fir, red cedar, nightshade, alder, western hemlock, ash, rose hips, red osier dogwood bushes, ninebark, <b>bittersweet</b> nightshade, jewelweed, and maples make up the various plant species at the park. Some of the cedar trees {{are more than a}} century old.|$|E
25|$|He {{regarded}} {{his life}} in <b>bittersweet</b> terms. He had risen from humble origins to mix with the intellectual elite and was by 35 a considerably wealthy man and leading member of the 'progressive sciences'. Nonetheless, he was insecure about his land holdings and his ambitions of obtaining important political posts remained frustrated. Perhaps he expected the astronomical rise he experienced in his early years to continue throughout his life. Contemporaries described him, nonetheless, as humorous, good-natured and rational.|$|E
25|$|White wine is {{regularly}} {{used as an}} ingredient. Its acidity balances well with fat taking away excess heaviness. This acidity also refines the meat or fish and it helps {{to break down the}} fibres of the meat to make it tender. The role of white wine {{is similar to that of}} lemon juice used under the same conditions: once verjuice also fulfilled this function. The vinegar combines acidity with a burning sensation that gives recipes where it is used a <b>bittersweet</b> side characteristic.|$|E
25|$|Tezeta {{literally}} means nostalgia, a <b>bittersweet</b> {{longing for}} the past. Tezeta mode is used to express dreams, wishes and yearnings. Ethiopian Jews used this mode to express their yearning to Jerusalem and the Land of Israel. After coming to Israel, this mode {{has been used to}} express nostalgia to Ethiopia. Some love and wedding songs were also composed in this mode, that originates from the Wollo region. Barihun & Yedid excel at performing the two pieces composed in this mode: Yehar Shererit and Fikir.|$|E
25|$|With {{the death}} of her father, Narmeleth is once again freed from the evil {{influence}} of Amarthiel. She becomes a captive of the Free Peoples, but volunteers to avenge her father. In Angmar, the final battle between the Free People and Mordirith ensues. First Mordrambor is defeated and Narchuil is finally destroyed by Narmeleth. In the final confrontation, she sacrifices herself in order to defeat Mordirith. The book ends <b>bittersweet</b> with Narmeleth's redemption and her death and Elrond comforts the player, saying that she had found peace in the Undying Lands.|$|E
25|$|The Angels {{got off to}} {{a mediocre}} start to the season in April; however, things looked to be turning around near the end of May, as {{slugging}} first baseman Kendry Morales was on pace to top his home run totals from 2009. However, on May 29, in a game against the Seattle Mariners, Morales hit a walk-off grand slam to give the Angels a 5–1 victory; this victory was quite <b>bittersweet,</b> as Morales broke his leg jumping on home plate. This would send Morales to the disabled list {{for the remainder of the}} 2010 season.|$|E
25|$|Hype aside, Private Parts made news {{because it}} was able to engross even the most {{conservative}} of audiences with its <b>bittersweet</b> (and unexpectedly moving) story about 3 transsexuals trying to find their place in life. Way before Hollywood was fêted for daring to do the same by putting Terence Stamp, Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving in heels and makeup for Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994). Not to mention Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo donning even bigger bouffants and bosoms in To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything (1995).|$|E
25|$|The boy had {{difficulties}} {{completing his}} education. He attended school {{only up to}} the 8th grade, and, upon turning 17, volunteered for service in the Romanian Land Forces, where he became a Sergeant. He preserved a <b>bittersweet</b> record of his army service, reflected in both Moș Teacă and some memoirs of military life. According to his own account, he was insulted by a senior officer for not reporting to him concerning the suicide of one recruit; he avenged himself by punching his superior {{in front of the}} entire company. Bacalbașa faced a court-martial but, since the recruits refused to report him, was merely demoted.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the romantic}} {{nature of the}} reinterpreted story, the finale was made <b>bittersweet,</b> with Sultan Mahmud cursing the Princess to live forever on Mount Ledang alone. In the {{original}} legend, the Princess was never condemned by a curse as she was beyond the Sultan's jurisdiction, and it is Sultan Mahmud who ultimately suffered by trying to fulfil her seven conditions. Historically, Sultan Mahmud was the last Sultan of Malacca, {{and at the end}} of his reign had to flee from his city, thus ending the Malaccan Sultanate. This Sultan Mahmud is sometimes confused with his great-grandson, Sultan Mahmud II, who was assassinated on his royal dais.|$|E
25|$|In late 2005, Kines {{entered a}} pitch in a one-minute film {{competition}} sponsored by stock photo company Getty Images. His pitch, a <b>bittersweet</b> sci fi-tinged tone poem entitled The Closest Thing to Time Travel, {{was selected as}} one of only 30 pitches (out of over 240 entries) to be turned into short films using Getty stock footage material. In early 2006 Kines finished his film, and when the competition was {{open to the public}} for final voting, The Closest Thing to Time Travel won Kines the Grand Prize of $10,000 and trips to New York City, Chicago, and Bozeman, Montana, where Kines was a speaker at HATCHfest.|$|E
25|$|Three basic {{colors are}} {{generally}} {{seen in the}} breed: Brown which includes all shades from a light cocoa (a silvered brown) to a deep <b>bittersweet</b> chocolate color; sedge which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; deadgrass which takes in all shades of deadgrass, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. Historic records show {{that some of the}} deadgrass shades can be very light, almost white in appearance, while darker deadgrass colors can include diluted shades of brown called ash, that appear as either gray or taupe. The almost white and ash/taupe/gray shades are not commonly seen, but are acceptable.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, {{he founded}} Geffen Records and {{recruited}} Warner Bros. Records exec Ed Rosenblatt as president. The Geffen label's meteoric rise to prominence {{within the year}} proved a <b>bittersweet</b> success. Geffen's first artist to sign on was Donna Summer, who was anxious to leave Casablanca/PolyGram Records. Geffen shortly after released her The Wanderer album, the lead single of which reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the album certified gold. Casablanca countered by releasing more singles off her 1979 Bad Girls album such as the song Walk Away and a similarly named hits compilation to compete, but by then New Wave sound was dominating the airwaves.|$|E
