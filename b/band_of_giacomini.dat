40|$|Abstract. The vein <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini</b> {{is often}} {{identified}} with the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein {{despite the fact that}} according to the international interdisciplinary anatomical nomenclature they are distinguished from one another. The objective of the research was to improve the results of treatment of patients with lower limb primary chronic venous disease disease studying the variation in anatomy and pathology of the vein <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini</b> and the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein with subsequent development of differential surgical tactics. Materials and methods. 502 patients with primary chronic venous disease on 605 legs were examined and treated. Each patient underwent preoperative ultrasonographic triplex scanning of the lower limb venous system. Results. Varicose dilatation of the vein <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini</b> was observed in 3. 8 % of patients (95 % CI 2. 4 - 5. 6 %), and the pathology of the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein was detected in 1. 7 % of patients (95 % CI 0. 8 - 3. 0 %). When the arch of the small saphenous vein was present the following variations in the pathology of the vein <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini</b> were observed: 1) the spread of reflux from the great saphenous vein to the vein of Giacomini; 2) reflux from the terminal valve of the small saphenous vein intensified the antegrade flow of blood within the vein <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini</b> resulting in reflux in the great saphenous vein distal {{to the point where the}} vein <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini</b> drained into the great saphenous vein. The causes of failure of the valves in the trunk of the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein included: 1) reflux from the ostium of the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein; 2) perforating vein reflux; 3) reflux from the terminal valve of the small saphenous vein. Conclusions.  The pathology of the vein <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini</b> and the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein is not homogeneous; therefore, surgical tactics in every patient has to be hemodynamically justified and differentiated depending on the pathways of pathological reflux spreading. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: We {{wanted to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of endovenous ablation of the incompetent vein <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini</b> using a 980 -nm diode laser. Materials and Methods: A total of 18 patients (18 limbs, 4 %) had the incompetent vein <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini.</b> Retrograde reflux originating from the great saphenous vein was noted in sixteen limbs and paradoxical diastolic anterograde reflux from the saphenopopliteal junction was observed in two limbs. After tumescent anesthesia, laser ablation using a 980 -nm wavelength laser fiber was performed under ultrasound and/or fluoroscopic guidance. Patients were evaluated clinically and with duplex ultrasound at one week and at one, three, six and twelve months after laser ablation for the technical and clinical success. Results: In the 18 limbs, the technical success rate was 100 %. Continued closure of the vein <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini</b> was seen in 18 of 18 limbs after one month, in 12 of 12 limbs after three and six months and in six of six limbs after twelve months. No recanalization of the vein and no major complications occurred. Conclusion: Endovenous laser ablation with a 980 -nm wavelength is an effective and safe procedure for treating an incompetent vein <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini...</b>|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Surveyor Deep-Sea Channel extends for {{approximately}} 700 km over the northern Alaskan Abyssal Plain. It originates {{near the base}} of the continental slope opposite Dry Bay and Alsek Strath and terminates in the Aleutian Trench south of Kodiak Island. East <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini</b> Seamount, the axial gradient of the channel is in the order of 10 m/km and its morphology is in agreement with prediction, assuming a depositional equilibrium with channelized turbidity currents. West <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini</b> Seamount, the axial gradient increases to values as high as 7. 5 m/km, as the channel course turns toward the northwest and plunges into the trench. Over this part of its length the measured center channel relief and cross-sectional area of the channel increase, contradicting prediction. The lower channel is found to be erosional in nature, this effect being a response to downwarping of the northern rim of the Pacific Plate into the Aleutian Trench. The channel originated in early to middle Pliocene time coeval with the initiation of pronounced tectonism and intense glaciation in southeastern Alaska. At this time, the channel was located perhaps 200 km south of its present position with relation to the North American Plate, and may have been linked with one of the fossil sea-channels on the eastern Aleutian Abyssal Plain. Throughout its history, the channel has not been linked with any consistent river drainage system, its sediment source instead being the large system of piedmont glaciers in southeastern Alaska. The distribution of coarse sedimentary material over the northern Gulf of Alaska strongly suggests that turbidity current activity has not been confined to only those regions close to Surveyor Deep-Sea Channel...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveCoursing the {{posterior}} thigh as a tributary or trunk {{projection of the}} small saphenous vein (SSV), the Giacomini vein's clinical significance in chronic venous disease (CVD) remains undetermined. This cross-sectional controlled study examined the prevalence, anatomy, competency status, and clinical significance <b>of</b> the <b>Giacomini</b> vein across the clinical spectrum of CVD {{in relation to the}} SSV termination. MethodsOne hundred eighty-nine consecutive subjects (301 limbs) with suspected CVD (109 men, 80 women; age, 18 - 87 years [median, 61 years]) underwent examination, clinical class (CEAP) stratification, and duplex ultrasound determination of the sites and extent of reflux > 0. 5 sec) and Giacomini vein's anatomy. ResultsA Giacomini vein was found in 70. 4 % of limbs (212 of 301; 95 % confidence interval, 65 %- 75. 6 %). Extent, pattern, and sites of reflux in all named superficial and deep veins were evenly distributed in limbs with and without a Giacomini vein; perforator vein incompetence in thigh and calf was also balanced (all, P >. 2). Giacomini vein had no effect (P >. 2) on SSV termination anatomy, displaying a similar prevalence in classes C 0 - 6. In 212 limbs, either as a tributary or trunk projection of the SSV, the Giacomini vein ascended subfascially (n = 210) to the lower (8 %; n = 17), middle (47. 6 %; n = 101), or upper (44. 3 %; n = 94) thigh, and terminated at the deep system (45. 3 %; n = 96) and/or perforated the fascia (64. 2 %; n = 136), to join the superficial system. Giacomini vein morphology was not affected by the SSV termination anatomy and CEAP clinical class. Incompetence was detected less often (P <. 001) in the Giacomini vein (4. 7 %; n = 10 of 212) than in the saphenous trunks cumulatively (53. 3 %; n = 113 of 212). Yet the odds ratio <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini</b> incompetence was 11. 94 (7 of 33 over 3 of 169) in the presence of SSV reflux, and 11. 67 (6 of 23 over 4 of 179) when both the great saphenous vein (proximal, proximal plus distal) and SSV were incompetent. ConclusionFound in more than two thirds <b>of</b> limbs, the <b>Giacomini</b> vein has a complex anatomy that is linked vastly to the deep or superficial veins of the posteromedial thigh, but is unaffected by the anatomy of SSV termination and CEAP clinical class. Its presence proved insignificant to the extent, pattern, sites, and clinical severity of venous incompetence, yet the Giacomini vein was far less often susceptible to reflux than the saphenous trunks were. Routine Giacomini vein investigation is not justified in view of these findings. Investigation could be considered selectively in limbs with SSV incompetence, with or without great saphenous vein incompetence, supported by the high odds <b>of</b> concomitant <b>Giacomini</b> vein reflux...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attacks the}} Meese-Rogoff (exchange rate disconnect) puzzle from a {{different}} perspective: out-of-sample interval forecasting. Most studies in the literature focus on point forecasts. In this paper, we apply Robust Semi-parametric (RS) interval forecasting {{to a group of}} Taylor rule models. Forecast intervals for twelve OECD exchange rates are generated and modified tests <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini</b> and White (2006) are conducted to compare the performance of Taylor rule models and the random walk. Our contribution is twofold. >; First, we find that in general, Taylor rule models generate tighter forecast intervals than the random walk, given that their intervals cover out-of-sample exchange rate realizations equally well. This result is more pronounced at longer horizons. Our results suggest a connection between exchange rates and economic fundamentals: economic variables contain information useful in forecasting the distributions of exchange rates. The benchmark Taylor rule model is also found to perform better than the monetary and PPP models. Second, the inference framework proposed in this paper for forecast-interval evaluation can be applied in a broader context, such as inflation forecasting, not just to the models and interval forecasting methods used in this paper.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Giacomini {{described}} a vein that now {{bears his name}} almost 130 years ago. Subsequent anatomic studies detail his findings but receive inadequate attention in clinical and surgical textbooks. The {{purpose of this study}} was to present a summary of the original observations by Giacomini, present our ultrasound scan findings, and review later anatomic, venographic, and ultrasound scan studies. Methods: The study was a literature review and experience with duplex ultrasound scanning from units in Italy and Australia. Results: Giacomini {{described a}} thigh extension from the lesser saphenous vein that passed to join with the greater saphenous vein, which since then bears his name, and described also the other destinations of the thigh extention to deep veins through perforators or an end as multiple tributaries in the superficial tissues or muscles. Duplex ultrasound scanning shows that the vein can be affected by varicose disease with reflux either upwards or downwards in the thigh to the greater or lesser saphenous veins respectively. Conclusion: Ultrasound scan imaging has brought the vein <b>of</b> <b>Giacomini</b> from the realm of anatomic dissection to an important structure to be considered in the clinical management of chronic venous disease.
