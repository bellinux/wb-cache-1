It remained for New York to usher {{in a new era}} in internal communication by authorizing in 1817 the construction of the Erie Canal. This bold bid for Western trade alarmed the merchants of Philadelphia, particularly as the completion of the national road threatened to divert much of their traffic to Baltimore. In 1825, the legislature of Pennsylvania grappled with the problem by projecting a series of canals which were to connect its great seaport with Pittsburgh on the west and with Lake Erie and the upper Susquehanna on the north. The Blackstone Canal, (1823–1828) in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and the Morris Canal across northern New Jersey (1824–1924) soon followed, along with the Illinois and Michigan Canal from Chicago to the Illinois River(1824–1848).|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} event {{not only in}} the history of domestic sheep, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> livestock, was the work of Robert Bakewell in the 18th century. Before his time, breeding for desirable traits was often based on chance, with no scientific process for selection of breeding stock. Bakewell established the principles of selective breeding—especially line breeding—in his work with sheep, horses and cattle; his work later influenced Gregor Mendel and Charles Darwin. His most important contribution to sheep was the development of the Leicester Longwool, a quick-maturing breed of blocky conformation that formed the basis for many vital modern breeds. Today, the sheep industry in the UK has diminished significantly, though [...] pedigreed rams can still fetch around 100,000 Pounds sterling at auction.|$|E
500|$|The reader's {{experience}} of Lucy is {{filtered through the}} narrator's perception. Her death suggests that nature can bring pain to all, even to those who loved her. According to the British classical and literary scholar H. W. Garrod (1878–1960), [...] "The truth is, as I believe, that between Lucy's perfection in Nature and her death there is, for Wordsworth, really no tragic antithesis at all." [...] Hartman expands on this view to extend the view of death and nature to art in general: [...] "Lucy, living, is clearly a guardian spirit, not of one place <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> English places... while Lucy, dead, has all nature for her monument. The series is a deeply humanized version {{of the death of}} Pan, a lament on the decay of English natural feeling. Wordsworth fears that the very spirit presiding over his poetry is ephemeral, and I think he refuses to distinguish between its death in him and its historical decline." ...|$|E

[...] Thus, Hume's argument against miracles had a more abstract basis founded upon the scrutiny, not just primarily of miracles, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> forms of belief systems.
