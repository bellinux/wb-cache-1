500|$|For its {{original}} Mega Drive release, Famitsu provided Alien Soldier {{with a score}} of 24 out of 40. Mean Machines called it [...] "a real gameplayer's game", citing the unrelenting waves of enemies and high difficulty. They noted how Treasure was beginning to establish a pattern of good games, and called Alien Soldier a modern classic. Simon Clays of Computer and Video Games {{found it to be}} challenging and unique by basing its gameplay on boss fights. Other editors from the magazine complemented the <b>boss</b> <b>design</b> and animations.|$|E
2500|$|The game's art style {{received}} acclaim. Stantion {{thought that}} the game's art-style is striking to look at. Clements praised the game's visuals, which he described as [...] "stunning". Joe Juba from Game Informer also praised the game's artistic direction, and he {{thought that the}} game's visuals install a sense of unpleasantness and surrealism to the game's alternate universe. The game's <b>boss</b> <b>design</b> was praised by Taljonick, but he expressed disappointment that these enemies are not fun to play with. In addition, he criticised the lack of enemy variety in the game.|$|E

50|$|Mega Man Star Force 2, {{known in}} Japan as Shooting Star Rockman 2 (Ryūsei no Rokkuman Tsū), is {{a video game}} {{developed}} by Capcom for the Nintendo DS handheld game console. It is the sequel to Mega Man Star Force. The game was first confirmed on April 12, 2007 in an issue of CoroCoro Comic. The same issue also revealed that a <b>boss</b> <b>design</b> contest would be held exclusively in Japan much like the same contests held for the Battle Network games. A sequel, Mega Man Star Force 3, was released on November 13, 2008 in Japan.|$|E

50|$|Sinistar: Unleashed {{received}} mixed reception when released. Critics lauded its audacity, {{as well as}} {{the addition}} of new features into the game. Several journalists felt that GameFX captured all the elements that represented a Sinistar game and stayed true to the franchise by feeling familiar to fans of the original game. However, critics faulted the <b>boss</b> <b>designs</b> and the repetitiveness of the gameplay.|$|R

5000|$|Although never released, Socks the Cat Rocks the Hill was {{reviewed}} by multiple publications who generally {{saw it as}} an average platformer albeit with excellent <b>boss</b> <b>design</b> and political satire. Nintendo Power found the boss characters to be humorous but criticized the poor controls. [...] GamePro also praised the bosses and the satire, but were more critical with the flat graphics and poor sound. Nintendo Power believed poor controls made the game challenging, but GamePro found the game easy and thought the controls [...] "take practice but prove effective." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly dubbed it [...] "a cute run-and-jump, claw the enemies game." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nintendo Power {{provided}} substantial {{coverage of}} Metal Storm. When {{the game was}} released, one of their issues featured the game on its cover and a 12-page strategy guide. In a later issue, they included Metal Storm among a series of games they dubbed [...] "Unsung Heroes of the NES." [...] They complimented the game's inventive play control, <b>boss</b> <b>design,</b> and level of challenge. They blamed low distribution for its lack in popularity, and referenced themselves as the best marketing support the game ever received. IGN ranked Metal Storm as #46 on their top 100 NES games list. They called the game a [...] "tour de force" [...] from a technical perspective, pushing the NES to its technical limits by using simulated parallax scrolling and advanced animation techniques.|$|E
5000|$|Gate of Thunder {{received}} generally positive reviews. It {{was rated}} {{one of the}} Turbo CD's best games by The PC Engine Software Bible, Gaming World, and Retro Game Age. GameSpot gave the Virtual Console release a 7/10, saying that the game is overly short and lacking in innovation (particularly noting {{the lack of any}} way of dealing with enemies other than shooting them), but that the memorable level and <b>boss</b> <b>design,</b> well-conceived weapons system, and consistently outstanding soundtrack make it a worthwhile purchase. IGN gave it an 8.5, concurring with the GameSpot review on most points, but arguing that Gate of Thunder makes a number of innovations to the shooter genre.

50|$|Set in Washington D.C., Socks the Cat Rocks the Hill {{follows the}} title {{character}} {{as he makes his}} way past spies, politicians, and the news media to warn the Clinton family of a stolen nuclear missile launch device. The game makes heavy use of political satire, including <b>bosses</b> <b>designed</b> as caricatures of former U.S. presidents and other political figures. Nintendo reportedly liked the game despite their censorship policies during the era which condemned games with political content. The political satire was also praised by critics, although the game was otherwise found to be average.|$|R

50|$|In January 2009, monthly Japanese {{magazine}} CoroCoro Comic {{held their}} annual Mega Man <b>boss</b> <b>design</b> contest. However, unlike previous contests, it was unknown what upcoming Mega Man title the winning boss would appear in, {{nor was it}} revealed even after the winner was announced as Clock Genius in the April 2009 issue. At the 2009 World Hobby Fair convention in Japan, the new Mega Man title was finally unveiled as a cross-over between the Battle Network and Star Force series. There was early speculation that the title may not just be a crossover, but also a remake of a previous Battle Network title, fueled by a comment made in an interview by GameTrailers with series producer Takeshi Horinouchi. Horinouchi later confirmed the speculation with {{the launch of the}} official teaser website announcing that the game is an enhanced remake of the first Battle Network title.|$|E
5000|$|Ueda {{wished the}} game to have a unique {{presentation}} and change how both players and developers perceived the idea of what bosses should be in video games. To achieve this, he ensured that the game's only enemies would be the sixteen colossi, that they could only be approached one at a time, {{and that they would}} have various behavior patterns. Though limiting the presence of enemies to only bosses was partly intended to differentiate the game from others, Ueda also expressed that it was to ensure that the programmers' focus was entirely on the colossi so that their quality would be as high as possible. In accordance with this focus upon the colossi—and his preference for simple controls—he intended that one button on the game controller be used solely for targeting the colossi during battles. Ueda cited The Legend of Zelda as an influence on the <b>boss</b> <b>design,</b> referring to the bosses as [...] "inverted Zelda dungeons." ...|$|E

5000|$|Philip Kollar of Polygon scored Lords of the Fallen a 7.5 out of 10. In his review, Kollar {{thought the}} game's story, concept, and {{characters}} were [...] "commendable", liked the slow weapons-based combat, saying that's where the game [...] "shines the brightest", and thought the game {{had a strong}} variation on the Souls formula, saying this could be [...] "signs of much brighter things to come". Kollar did however criticize the game's technical issues, calling them [...] "near-game-ending", dislike the game's easier difficulty level, saying he would beat certain areas [...] "on {{the first or second}} try", and thought the boss battles, and the <b>boss</b> <b>designs,</b> weren't as strong as they should be.|$|R
5000|$|The {{developers}} {{also took}} advantage of technological capabilities available on the MSX. As an upgrade, the MSX port featured more sound channels than the Famicom, and as such many music tracks and sound effects were altered or improved. The MSX version also boasts {{a wider range of}} colors, updated graphics, new monster and <b>boss</b> <b>designs</b> (dragons at the end of caves, for example, were replaced with lizard-like monsters), and a new sidebar, which displayed the player's life meter, allocated power-ups, and allocated elements. The MSX could not smoothly render vertical scrolling - unlike the Famicom - so the movement of the graphics is very [...] "choppy" [...] in comparison. Some of these changes are very similar to the changes that took place when Square's Final Fantasy was ported to the MSX2.|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} an organic fiber in an epoxy matrix by winding 20 -cm diam spherical and cylindrical pressure vessels of various designs. For the spherical vessels, we used soft aluminum liners 0. 76 mm thick for a double <b>boss</b> <b>design</b> and 2 mm thick for a single <b>boss</b> <b>design.</b> For the cylindrical vessels, we used both 0. 5 -mm rubber liners and 0. 76 -mm soft aluminum liners. Vessels of both types were tested for burst pressure and cyclic fatigue at room temperature and liquid hydrogen temperature. The effects of temperature and vessel shape on the vessel performance factor were negligible. Our vessel fatigue data were marred by premature failure of the liners...|$|E
40|$|Medieval {{builders}} didn't have {{a scientific}} structural theory, however gothic cathedrals were not build without a theory. Gothic masters had a ‘scientia', {{a body of}} knowledge which permitted the safe design of their buildings. The nature of this theory has not only a historical or erudite interest; perhaps something could {{be learned from the}} true masters of masonry architecture. 	Literary sources from the gothic period are scarce; in almost all we find structural rules to design the principal structural elements: walls, vaults (ribs and keystones) and, above all, buttresses. These rules (arithmetical or geometrical) conduced in most cases to a certain proportions independently of size, to geometrically similar designs (for example, the depth of a buttress is a fraction of the span). Very rarely, and this is the case with Rodrigo Gil, appeared arithmetical rules which lead to non-proportional designs (following Rodrigo's rule the buttresses become more slender in relation to the span as the size increases). 	These rules were a means to register stable forms. Proportional rules are, as has pointed Professor Heyman, essentially correct. It is a problem of stability and not of strength. Non-proportional rules express a finer adjustment to some non-proportional design problems: buttress design for the thin domical cross vaults (bóvedas baídas), <b>boss</b> <b>design</b> for the vaults themselves, and wall design for towers. The rules were deduced empirically, give correct dimensions, but above all draw our attention to some significant facts of design which so far have remained unnoticed...|$|E

50|$|In 2006, Ion Media Networks reached several {{programming}} deals, {{two with}} major programming suppliers that were announced {{within a week}} of each other, and another that among other things would bring original programming to Ion Television's lineup. On June 27, 2006, Ion Media announced a comprehensive programming deal with Warner Bros. Television Distribution, which gave it the broadcast rights to movies and television series owned by the company. One week later on July 5, Ion announced a similar deal that resulted in the acquisition of broadcast rights to films and series distributed by Sony Pictures Television. Starting in September of that year, series and feature films from both libraries were incorporated onto the network's prime time schedule (including Who's the <b>Boss?,</b> <b>Designing</b> Women, Mama's Family, Growing Pains, Green Acres, and The Wonder Years). However, these older series were later dropped when the network shifted towards more recent series. Ion also struck a library content deal with NBCUniversal, which gave it access to shows such as Alfred Hitchcock Presents.|$|R
