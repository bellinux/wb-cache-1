500|$|Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly {{argues that}} Scaramanga {{is the best}} villain of the Roger Moore James Bond films, while listing Mary Goodnight among the worst Bond girls, saying that [...] "Ekland may have {{had one of the}} series' best bikinis, but her dopey, doltish {{portrayal}} was a turnoff as much to filmgoers as to fans of Ian Fleming's novels". The Times put Scaramanga as the fifth best Bond villain in their list, and Ekland was the third in their list of the top 10 most fashionable Bond girls. Maxim listed Goodnight at fourth in their Top Bond Babes list, saying that [...] "Agent Goodnight is the clumsiest spy alive. <b>But</b> <b>who</b> <b>cares</b> as long as she's using her perfect bikini bottom to muck things up?" ...|$|E
500|$|Matthews later {{admitted}} {{that she was not}} a serious fan of the show, but that she only used the line because it adequately described the type of relationship she was singing about. In an interview with the Daily Record, she explained, [...] "I'm not a big fan of [...] but I got the line about things getting strange for Mulder and Scully from watching the odd episode". After questioning, she later said that she would [...] "prefer to go out for {{a night on the town}} with Gazza and Chris Evans than meet [...] stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny". Matthews also related that [...] "I'm sure loads of people bought the record by mistake, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>cares?</b> They should be flattered we wrote a song about [...] anyway".|$|E
500|$|Despite these criticisms, the {{remainder}} of the season earned mostly positive reviews among critics. The season scored 62 out of 100 on Metacritic (a website that assigns a weighted average score for media), which translates to [...] "generally favorable reviews." [...] Time magazine wrote that [...] "It's ironic that NBC's most original sitcom in years is a remake, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>cares?</b> The Office is a daring, unflinching take on very American workplace tensions." [...] Boston.com felt that the first season of The Office was good, and the differences between the characters of the American and the original series added to the popularity of the series. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that The Office succeeded in its first season, and that although NBC had failed in the past with television shows such as Coupling, it had found achievement with The Office. Entertainment Weekly awarded the season a [...] "B+" [...] and wrote that The Office [...] "is clever and insular, capturing all the drudgery, awkwardness, and rivalry of cubicle living" [...] and that the last five episodes help to illustrate that the series has [...] "crossed the pond handily." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite its title, {{the word}} [...] "your" [...] is not {{heard in the}} song until its reprise. The track's {{introduction}} is proceeded by a spoken monologue. Beginning [...] "Look at this stuff, isn't it neat? Wouldn't you think my collection's complete? Wouldn't you think I'm the girl/The girl who has everything?", [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is [...] "a plea {{for a life of}} discovery" [...] and [...] "inquisitiveness" [...] as opposed to love, using [...] "nonsensical expressions" [...] such as [...] "gadgets", [...] "gizmos", [...] "whosits" [...] and [...] "whatsits" [...] in lieu of various human artifacts. Lyrically, the ballad employs several [...] "twist and turns", using very specific lyrics to describe both the performer's fascination with the human world and desire to walk among them, including [...] "walking around on those what-do-you-call-them?... feet" [...] and [...] "Up where they walk, up where they run/Up where they stay all day in the sun/Wanderin' free, wish I could be/Part of that world." [...] Comprising [...] "impeccable rhymes" [...] while incorporating the term [...] "thingamabobs" [...] into the line [...] "You want thing-a-ma-bobs? I've got twenty <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>cares?</b> No big deal, I want more", [...] "Part of Your World"'s [...] "empowering" [...] lyrics convey several messages, such as facing one's fears, believing in oneself, and wishing for new life experiences. The ballad concludes with a final chorus belted [...] "When's it my turn? Wouldn't I love, love to explore that world up above? Out of the sea/Wish I could be/Part of that world".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{won in the}} [...] "Best Single Episode" [...] {{category}} at the 2010 British Soap Awards, and {{was nominated}} in the [...] "Best Live Event Coverage" [...] category of the Broadcast Digital Awards 2010. It received mixed reviews from critics. Tom Sutcliffe of The Independent rated [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] 4 out of 5, noting that there were [...] "a couple of moments where the seams showed", but that [...] "half the fun in watching was seeing if you could spot them". He praised EastEnders for not [...] "playing safe" [...] by including stunt work, and commented that Ian Beale's line: [...] "I wish we could {{go back and do}} it all again. Do it right this time." [...] could potentially have been [...] "a horrible hostage to fortune", however felt that: [...] "in the end they more than got away with it." [...] Tim Teeman of The Times also rated the episode 4 out of 5, calling the revelation of Stacey as Archie's killer a [...] "genuine surprise", and commenting that [...] "EastEnders Live": [...] "sometimes creaked under the weight of its own ambitions – <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>cares,</b> gold stars for effort." [...] Teeman praised Clements and Turner, feeling that they [...] "excelled themselves despite the odd strained pause", though noted that in the aftermath of Bradley's fall, [...] "the perils of live TV became apparent", commenting that: [...] "The direction slackened at just the wrong moment, and you were left hoping someone would get to a bit of script to ward off any more bizarre shots of Jack and Max fighting to free themselves from a policeman's soft grip." ...|$|E
500|$|Den of Geek placed both [...] "Part of Your World" [...] and its reprise {{at number}} one on the website's ranking of [...] "The Top 25 Best Disney Songs from the Renaissance Era", with author David Crow {{referring}} to it as the song that [...] "defined the Disney formula to come." [...] Mic also ranked the song first, with author Jordan Appugliesi calling it [...] "everything Disney fans want and need." [...] M Magazine concurred, highlighting [...] "You want thing-a-ma-bobs? I've got twenty <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>cares?</b> No big deal, I want more" [...] as the magazine's favorite lyric. Variety agreed that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is the second [...] "Best Disney Song of All Time", crowning it Ashman and Menken's [...] "most flawlessly constructed [...] composition". Billboard considers [...] "Part of Your World" [...] to be the Disney Renaissance's eighth best song, with contributor Taylor Weatherby crediting it with inspiring an entire generation to use the term [...] "thingamabob". Ranking the ballad the eighth greatest Disney song, IGN's Lucy O'brien wrote that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] "has since become a shower-staple for girls the world over, with particular emphasis given to 'bet they don’t…REPRIMAND their daughters,' universally." [...] Awarding the song the same placement, HitFix's Donna Dickens wrote that the ballad [...] "spoke to everyone from six to ninety-six" [...] with Ariel becoming [...] "the stand-in for every child who ever felt like an outsider, every teen navigating the waters of becoming an adult, every parent struggling to remember the urgency of adolescence" [...] and [...] "every human who ever burned to do more than exist in a mundane town". ET Canada placed the song at number 11 on their ranking of [...] "The Top 12 Disney Songs Of All Time", joking, [...] "Singing to a fork has never been so memorable".|$|E

He was not born when his father, Geoffrey, had his brains trampled out at the tournament; and, besides the misfortune of never having known a father's guidance and protection, he had the additional misfortune to have a foolish mother (CONSTANCE by name), lately married to her third husband. She took Arthur, upon John's accession, to the French King, who pretended {{to be very much}} his friend, and who made him a Knight, and promised him his daughter in marriage; <b>but,</b> <b>who</b> <b>cared</b> so little about him in reality, that finding it his interest to make peace with King John for a time, he did so without the least consideration for the poor little Prince, and heartlessly sacrificed all his interests.|$|R
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{reported that}} [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter" [...] was a [...] "stellar episode that was hitting {{all the right}} beats", and commented that [...] "ven the tired, formulaic structure of Jack's two women scenario was given some great new lines" [...] from Fey and Cannon, who developed the script. He opined that if the episode centered only around Jack's two women dilemma it [...] "would have been just fine." [...] Canning appreciated Elizabeth Banks' and Julianne Moore's appearances, writing that the two [...] "exhibited the charms that have made them welcome additions to this season". In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9.2 out of 10 rating. Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad said that the Toofer story was [...] "funny, without being (too) offensive." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin said that he enjoyed [...] "just about every minute" [...] of this episode, and praised Liz's speech citing it as the [...] "crowning moment" [...] from [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter". Rabin also liked the Toofer quitting storyline writing that it [...] "could easily have gone nowhere but the show made it both funny and surprisingly thoughtful by {{using it as a}} springboard to discuss Affirmative Action and our society's defiantly uneven playing field." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik noted that this episode was stronger than [...] "Khonani", which aired the same day of the week as this episode. Sean Gandert of Paste wrote that Toofer's plot was not [...] "given {{more than a few minutes}} of screen time [...] it also doesn't wear out its welcome... The show doesn't address race, gender, or affirmative action in a particularly enlightened manner, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>cares,</b> it's funny." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that he found the most enjoyment in Liz's story, writing that he found it [...] "endearing". In regards to Jack's plot, Mersel said that Jack is able to play off Nancy and Avery so well that [...] "I am going back and forth on whether or not to scold the NBC boss or give him a pat on the back. Avery and Nancy both have their shining moments, but I feel that he must choose quite soon, or he will be loosing [...] both." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} tour was acclaimed by critics. Jane Stevenson from Toronto Sun gave the concert {{four out of five}} stars and said that Lady Gaga came across as a [...] "confident, colourful, and campy performer. [...] Gaga's success was evident with slick-looking videos, lights, elaborate costumes, dancers, and yes, a band, even if her stage was sometimes left dark as she left to make numerous changes." [...] T'Cha Dunlevy for The Gazette noted that the performance was lacking—adding that the show never reached its peak until the end, when Gaga performed the [...] "real rendition" [...] of [...] "Poker Face" [...] and [...] "Bad Romance." [...] "Better late than never", Dunlevy concluded. Aedan Helmer from Jam! magazine said that [...] "At first blush, it might seem the real driving force behind Gaga's meteoric rise to fame is her hand-picked cadre of costume and set designers—dubbed Haus of Gaga—who seemingly know no bounds when it comes to pushing the envelope of haute couture and the theatre of the absurd. [...] But what really sets Gaga apart from the middling masses of lip-synching Britney clones and Idol wannabes is her pure, unadulterated musical talent. [...] The Lady can sing." [...] Theatre critic Kelly Nestruck, while writing for The Guardian, said [...] "While The Monster Ball has nothing on the great operas or the golden age of musical theatre, Lady Gaga's 'electro-pop opera' is at least twice as entertaining and infinitely fresher than any stage musical written over the last decade." [...] Lauren Carter from Boston Herald praised the show saying [...] " [...] only has two albums under her belt <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>cares?</b> Every song feels like a hit, and Gaga-as-star is already taking on Madonna-like proportions. [...] After [...] at the Wang Theater, fans could justifiably walk away thinking Lady Gaga is crazy, brilliant or both." [...] Jeremy Adams from Rolling Stone reviewed the performance at Wang Center in Boston and said that [...] "Throughout the evening, Gaga [...] aimed for a kind of pop theatricality that might potentially cement her burgeoning status as performance artist." ...|$|E
