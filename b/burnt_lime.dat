25|$|At Bugsworth, {{limestone}} {{brought down}} the tramway was either put into boats {{to be taken to}} Manchester and beyond or it was put into lime kilns to be burnt to produce quick lime. The trade in limestone and quick lime (also known as <b>burnt</b> <b>lime),</b> as well as the transport of coal into the basin for firing the kilns, accounted for the greatest proportion of the Canal Company's income.|$|E
25|$|Archaeologists have {{demonstrated}} that civilization in Syria {{was one of the}} most ancient on earth. Syria is part of the Fertile Crescent, and since approximately 10,000 BCE it was one of the centers of Neolithic culture (PPNA) where agriculture and cattle breeding appeared for the first time in the world. The Neolithic period (PPNB) is represented by rectangular houses of the Mureybet culture. In the early Neolithic period, people used vessels made of stone, gyps and <b>burnt</b> <b>lime.</b> Finds of obsidian tools from Anatolia are evidence of early trade relations. The cities of Hamoukar and Emar flourished during the late Neolithic and Bronze Age.|$|E

25|$|Her {{remains were}} found in Vilnius Cathedral after a flood in 1931. To {{preserve}} her body during the long summer trip from Kraków to Vilnius, it was covered {{in a mixture of}} ash and <b>burnt</b> <b>lime.</b> While the wooden coffin rotted away, the lime hardened and formed a protective shell that preserved her bones rather well. She was buried with regal symbols (silver gilded crown, silver scepter, golden orb with a cross) and jewelry (long gold necklace, three gold rings; one of them, gifted to her by Sigismund Augustus, was covered with black vitreous enamel and had three stones – brilliant, ruby, and emerald). These and other artifacts were kept at Vilnius Cathedral, but they disappeared during World War II.|$|E
25|$|While {{building}} the North Midland Railway from Derby to Rotherham and Leeds, Stephenson had found rich coal seams in the Clay Cross area {{and he saw}} a new business opportunity. Crich was already well known {{for the quality of}} the limestone and Stephenson recognised that he could use the local coal and limestone to produce <b>burnt</b> <b>lime</b> for agricultural purposes, and then utilise the new railway to distribute it. Cliff Quarry, where Crich Tramway Village is now located, was acquired by Stephenson's company and to link the quarry with the limekilns he had built alongside the new North Midland Railway at Ambergate, Stephenson constructed a metre gauge line - apparently the first metre gauge railway in the world. Stephenson was born in Wylam in Northumberland in 1781, but he lived the last 10 years of his life in Chesterfield, often bringing visitors to Crich to see the mineral railway and take refreshment in one of the village inns. He died in 1848 and is buried in Holy Trinity Church, Chesterfield. Stephenson's railway soldiered on for many years.|$|E
25|$|Edo {{suffered}} badly from devastating {{fires and}} the 1657 Great Fire of Meireki {{was a turning}} point in urban design. Initially, as a method of reducing fire spread, the government built stone embankments in at least two locations along rivers in the city. Over time these were torn down and replaced with dōzō storehouses that were used both as fire breaks and to store goods unloaded from the canals. The dōzō were built with a structural frame made of timber coated with a number of layers of earthen plaster on the walls, door and roof. Above the earthen roofs was a timber framework supporting a tiled roof. Although Japanese who had studied with the Dutch at their settlement in Dejima advocated building with stone and brick this was not undertaken because of their vulnerability to earthquakes. Machiya and storehouses from the later part of the period are characterised by having a black coloration to the external plaster walls. This colour was made by adding India ink to <b>burnt</b> <b>lime</b> and crushed oyster shell.|$|E
50|$|Between 1505 and 1507 the few sculptures {{from the}} {{mausoleum}} {{that had not}} been smashed and <b>burnt</b> for <b>lime</b> were integrated into the castle for decoration.

25|$|The topmost Jurassic {{layer is}} called the White Jurassic due to its light colour. These layers can be up to 400m thick in the Franconian Jura, but at Hesselberg they are mostly ablated; only 85m is left. The rocks of the Malm are partly sediments and partly formed from reefs of ancient sea sponges. This rock is widely {{distributed}} on the main peak. The light-coloured lime of the White Jurassic was a popular building material for houses (<b>burnt</b> <b>lime)</b> and for road construction (rubble). The depressions on the western plateau are caused by these excavations. The lowest layers form the Impressa-layers (low Malm alpha), which are approximately 25m thick, and the Bimammatum-lime (high Malm alpha). The old name of the Planula-lime (Malm beta) is factory lime, which indicates the use as building material. This layer, which is 15m thick and interspersed with sponge reefs, forms the plateau of the Osterwiese. The small quarry below the main peak consists of Planula-lime in its lower part, and the Ataxiocerate's layer (Malm gamma) in its upper, which builds up the main peak and is 20m thick. The top layer of Malm gamma and the layers of Malm delta to Malm zeta have already been eroded away on Hesselberg.|$|E
25|$|In August 1945, {{only three}} months {{after the end of the}} war the Chemische Fabrik Kalk began to produce <b>burnt</b> <b>lime</b> for the purpose of bartering. Workers {{returning}} from war captivity cannibalized some sections of the plant to repair other sections. Some equipment and tools that were removed from the factory before the bombing raids were returned. In March 1946 the production of ammonium sulfate resumed. In 1947 large parts of the factory were rebuilt and in the summer of 1948 production of susperphosphate in September 1948 production of Kampdünger resumed. As potash was added to the Kampdünger it was sold as KAMPKA-Dünger (the ending KA standing for Kalisalz, the German word for potash). In 1950 the production of the company had reached the old pre-war production level and the company had a market share of 20 percent of the German market for sodium carbonate, although it decreased to 13 percent one year later. During this time the management again considered a move of the factory from Kalk to Godorf, but after a study concluded that a moving the factory would be more costly than staying in Kalk the already purchased land in Godorf was sold. In 1952 the Salzdetfurth AG acquired a 25 percent share of Chemische Fabrik Kalk and increased the share to 75 percent in 1957.|$|E

Of the ten species of Bivalves and Gastropods fished, the window-pane oyster is most important (4000 tons) followed by the ark shell (1000 tons). None of these shellfish are eaten locally.

50|$|The Limestone Industry {{was also}} {{significant}} in Froghall. At the nearby Froghall wharf, Limestone was loaded onto Canal narrow boats or <b>burnt</b> in <b>lime</b> kilns and then {{transported to the}} Potteries or further afield.The Limestone was mined in the huge quarries at Caldon low and then loaded onto an inclined Tramway to Froghall. Four Tramways were built and parts {{of them are still}} tracable in the landscape including various bridges and inclines. The final tramway, built by James Trubshaw was the most significant and involved the most engineering. Trubshaw's tunnel near Windy Harbour is an excellent relic of this fourth route. The Canal basin at Froghall wharf is now a pleasant spot for pleasure craft and walkers,with the huge dormant lime kilns dominating the area. It is hard to imagine the scene 100 years ago when loaded dusty wagons came speeding down the incline,with the noise from the crushing plant and the furnaces deafening and dust from the stone and smoke from the furnaces polluting the atmosphere.|$|R

Messages were sent to relatives and nearby tribes to meet up and feast on the harvested nuts at bush clearing set in the mountains as Baroon Pocket, a site described as a paradise in the wilderness by a German missionary who saw it, and one now flooded out by the Baroon Pocket Dam. This intertribal feasting was reciprocated by the coastal peoples who, when the Blue Mountain lorikeets {{showed up on the}} Brisbane river, who alert hinterland tribes like the Dalla that mullet (and flounder, bream and whiting) were now running in the bay, ready for fishing.
