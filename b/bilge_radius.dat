40|$|Shallow water effects {{change the}} flow around a ship {{significantly}} which {{can affect the}} optimum design of the hull. This paper describes a study into the optimization of the aft ship region for various water depths. The research focuses on variations of the following parameters of a hull form: The athwart ship’s propeller location, the tunnel top curvature, the flat-of-bottom shape in the stern region and the stern <b>bilge</b> <b>radius.</b> All hull form variants are valuated in 3 different water depths using a viscous flow solver, and a surrogate model is created for each water depth. Pareto plots are used to present the trade-off between the optimization for one or another water depth. Finally, specific hull forms are chosen and the differences in flow behavior among hull forms and water depths are explained. Ship Design, Production and Operation...|$|E
40|$|The main {{contribution}} of this thesis {{is on the}} study of optimization methods in aft hull design. The optimization methods are inverse geometry design methods to find an aft hull with the flow velocities we specify. The analytic foundation for the flow is given by Stratford in [31], and gives a prescribed velocity distribution on the aft body. With the parameter β we have adjusted this flow to have a certain margin to separation along the pressure recovery region. This principle and optimization method are successfully applied to design of ships with pram-type aft hull. The 2 D optimized profiles corresponds to centerline buttock, and 3 D hull sections are extended from this centerline buttock with a <b>bilge</b> <b>radius.</b> Stratfords original pressure distribution for pressure recovery region were meant for Reynolds numbers up to 107. We have extended Stratfords formula to yield for ship full scale Reynolds numbers to 109. Different optimization methods were programmed and tested. The best routine for our optimization of aft hull with Stratford flow, was when the offset y-value were the optimization parameter to be changed. When we tried to optimize a complete 2 D profile with a given pressure distribution, it worked best to use the variables in a B-spline as the optimization parameter. Extensive windtunnel tests and towing tank tests are carried out. The tests verified the hydrodynamic properties of the hulls. Towing tests indicates that the optimized hull lines have lower total resistance than conventional ships with the same main dimensions. Both the frictional, viscous pressure resistance and wave making resistance are significantly lower. Further we can increase cargo capacity with the same power consumption, and achieve a more favourable distribution of the displacement in the aft hull. This study has shown us that the slant angle for the bottom of the aft hull should not excess 15 º with horizontal plane due to danger of separation over the bilge, and longitudinal vortices forming. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally ships {{have been}} {{optimized}} for minimizing the fuel consumption in calm water. For slow, large ships like tankers and bulk carriers this {{has resulted in}} very blunt bows with high added resistance due to waves. The objective of this thesis has been to investigate if the optimal bow shape, when realistic wave conditions are taken into account, should be more slender than the current blunt bows. The added resistance is also highly dependent on the actual wave conditions the vessel experiences. Thus a question has been if the optimal bow changes with the operational area, or route, of the vessel. Five designs have been investigated representing a range of waterlines from blunt to sharp. They {{are based on the}} MOERI Tanker KVLCC 2. KVLCC 2 A is the original design of the MOERI Tanker with no flare. KVLCC 2 B has the same water line curve as KVLCC 2 A, but with straight sides and small <b>bilge</b> <b>radius</b> in the bow. KVLCC 2 C has a more slender bow by moving volume from the shoulders to above the bulb. KVLCC 2 D is a blunter design than KVLCC 2 A and KVLCC 2 E has been elongated by 8 m compared to KVLCC 2 C to get a more slender bow. Four routes have been chosen to represent trades and ocean areas. The routes are; Arabian Gulf (AG) to the Gulf of Mexico (GM), AG to Japan, Brazil to China and Norway to the East Coast of US. Calm water resistance has been calculated and verified against experimental data. The wave resistance was calculated numerically using Shipflow. These calculations were not satisfying and should be taken a closer look at. Modification of the results had to be done. The results show that KVLCC 2 A, KVLCC 2 C and KVLCC 2 E have very similar calm water resistance. They have slightly lower values than KVLCC 2 D. KVLCC 2 B has the greatest calm water resistance. The added resistance was calculated by ShipX. The sharper bow designs have significantly lower resistance in the diffraction regime, as intended. KVLCC 2 E has slightly a slightly lower added resistance coefficient in the short wave regime than KVLCC 2 C. The speed-loss calculations were performed by combining wave statistics for the routes, calm water resistance, added resistance and engine and propulsion characteristics in ShipX. The result is an attainable speed at a given power input, 27 000 kW. The results show that KVLCC 2 C and KVLCC 2 E have the lowest speed-loss. The attainable speed is highest for KVLCC 2 C and it can thus be concluded that a sharper design is more optimal when realistic wave conditions are taken into account. The relative speed loss on different routes between KVLCC 2 C and KVLCC 2 A shows that the speed loss of KVLCC 2 C is 14. 2 % lower for the AG to GM, 13. 8 %, 16. 2 % and 14. 9 % for respectively AG to Chiba, Mongstad to East coast of US and Brazil to China. Thus, a small difference can be seen, but not enough to change the best design in this case. A review of innovative bow shapes dealing with added resistance was performed and an evaluation based on working principles and applicability to a large, slow vessel was discussed. The designs reviewed were X-bow (Ulstein Design), a new bow from STX OSV and Beak-bow, Ax-bow and LEADGE-bow designed in Japan especially for larger ships. The two first bows are designed primarily with offshore service vessels in mind and focus more on the long waves. The LEADGE-bow, which is based more or less on the same principles as KVLCC 2 C, shows that a simple sharpening of the bow is an easy and effective measure. This seems like the most promising bow for large, slow ships of those evaluated. </p...|$|E
40|$|To {{guaranty}} {{safety of}} the vessel, operation and especially the people during offshore activities, a motion analysis is executed. The motion analysis determines the motions over the entire frequency spectrum. Motions are amplified when incoming wave frequencies come to {{the vicinity of the}} natural frequency of the vessel, hence a very interesting region concerning the {{safety of the}} operation. In the vicinity of the natural frequency the motions are highly dependent on the present damping, therefore an accurate prediction of the damping is desired. This thesis study aims to improve the roll damping operation of sheerlegs (barge-type vessels) Taklift 4 and Taklift 7 during a lifting opertation. This is achieved by implementing the viscous roll damping component and investigating the effect of a vertical center of gravity well above the waterline. A high VCG results in a coupled motion between roll and sway. The effect of a high vertical center of gravity on the potential and viscous roll damping is studied. Furtermore, the viscous roll damping is determined applying three different techniques. Finally all models are validated with data from pre-executed experiments. Theory developed by Ikeda, Tanaka and Himeno (IHT) is implemented to compute the viscous roll damping for ship shaped hulls and barge-type hulls. IHT theory is the ITTC recommended procedure for practical assesment of viscous roll damping in absence of experiments, as long as the hull dimensions and motion conditions are within the set limitations. Two numerical models are developed according to IHT theory, the IHT - Ship model and IHT - Barge model. The IHT - Ship model is verified and showed no discrepancies with the verifying document. However, the calculated viscous roll damping for the Taklift 4 is surprisingly small when compared to the potential roll damping. The estimation of the <b>bilge</b> <b>radius</b> and the lewis transformation to determine the velocity increment appeared to be the least accurate parameters causing an inaccurate viscous roll damping estimation. After the IHT - Barge model is developed, it is directly validated together with the ‘κ-formula’-model against the decay test data. Journee designed the κ-formula’-model, which contains the potential roll damping ratio and a viscous contribution multiplied with the square-root of the roll angle. The validation shows that the ‘κ-formula’-model consistently estimates the viscous roll damping in a more accurate manner for barges where 5 ≤B/T≤ 7. 5. Unfortunately, the decay tests were limited with an initial roll angles up to five or six degrees. It is rather challenging to define a limitation concerning a roll angle for this approach. Therefore, the ‘κ-formula’-model can safely be used, but for large roll angles it is advised to maintain a conservative user approach. For barges where B/T= 10, the IHT – Barge model is not appropriate and also the ‘κ-formula’-model is accurate for roll angles smaller than 2. 5 degrees. It is suggested the free surface effects ‘hide’ the dependence of the viscous roll damping and the roll angle. The third technique to determine the viscous roll damping, is the so-called Magnuson approach. Magnuson applied an equivalent linearization procedure on the experimental data of the Noble Denton JIP to determine the viscous roll damping. To develop the Magnuson approach, experimental data providing motion response and environmental conditions is required. Such data is not available for the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7, hence results from pre-executed experiments are used, which among other things contains free decay test results and behavior in regular beam waves for rectangular scale models with similar dimensions as the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7. The main difference between the vessels studied in this thesis scope and pre-executed experiments, is the height the vertical center of gravity (VCG). A VCG above the waterline causes the response motion to change from 'pure' roll to a coupled roll-sway motion. Due to a phase difference between the coupled terms and b 44 and b 22 term, the B 44 p is decreasing for increasing VCG. The B 44 p coefficient becomes zero for a certain location of the VCG, which could not be explained physically in this thesis. The effect of the VCG on the b 44 v is positive. It is suggested the coupled roll-sway motion and secondary separation can account for this. An attempt is made to determine viscous effects of b 24, b 42 and b 22. Very limited studies are executed on this topic, hence {{it is very difficult to}} determine the correctness of the computations. After all developed models were compared with each other, the Magnuson approach showed most promise. Therefore this approach is used to determine the viscous roll damping of the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7. Viscous damping ratios of 0. 041 and 0. 034 respectively, were computed for the most similar scale models, hence a viscous damping ratio of 0. 0375 for both Taklift vessels is determined. It is left for future work to determine how the workability of the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7 is increased by the more accurate roll damping prediction.
