5|$|Stewie is {{in terrible}} pain from {{teething}} and cannot find comfort anywhere. When his mother Lois {{tells him that}} his pain will ultimately pass, it gives him the idea to build a machine that will move time forward {{to the point where}} his teething will have already stopped. Meanwhile, Lois tells Peter to drive their other son Chris to his soccer match, then come right <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after Stewie. However, Peter's friend Quagmire is there, and has brought beer, so Peter decides to ignore Lois and stay at the game. While there, another member of the crowd insults Chris. Enraged, Peter punches this person in the face, only to discover that it is a pregnant woman who looks and sounds like a man.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot {{describes}} {{a journey through}} a child's emotions and anxieties. After befriending the monster, the boy leaves Earth on the creature's <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for life elsewhere in the galaxy. He hopes {{to find someone to}} relate to. The hollow planet Gravida's surface is patrolled by a creature that complains of stomach pains. This larger creature is followed by several tiny creatures, some of which ride on its back. One of these smaller inhabitants has fallen into the core of Gravida. Though it is isolated and lonely, the creature consoles itself that nobody can harm it. The planet Malaisus is composed of water, with a monster identical to the player's swimming around with a shoal of fish. The monster tells the player to leave. Planet Bibulon has two faces on opposite sides, one angry and one happy. A two-faced creature travels across the surface; one is happy and the other morose. Bibulon is orbited by four moons, each of which has differing opinions on an unnamed man or boy. When players find the planet Debasa, they discover that it is surrounded by a green fog. Gravity is very intense within the fog. Four orbiting satellites produce the fog, which has trapped two boys. Earth shrinks slightly after each planet has been completed. After restoring color to all the surrounding planets, the game is completed by returning to Earth. The Earth has shrunk until it is only slightly larger than the monster; it is destroyed when the boy and his monster land. Both fly upwards and land on the moon, where the boy is free to craft a future of his choosing.|$|E
25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she got close to the body, she noticed a pool of blood. She turned <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the two men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E

2500|$|For {{quite some}} time, {{he had been}} {{planning}} to direct an epic movie named Megalopolis, {{a story about the}} aftermath and reconstruction of New York City after a mega-disaster, but after the city was hit by the real life disaster of September 11, the project was suddenly seen as being too sensitive. In 2007 he stated that [...] "I have abandoned that as of now. I plan to begin a process of making one personal movie after another and if something leads me <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at that, which I'm sure it might, I'll see what makes sense to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|A convoy {{located on}} 26 February {{did not offer}} a chance of attack, because [...] had first fired on it causing its escorts to chase Balao from the scene. Two days later, Balao sighted smoke on the horizon and {{commenced}} tracking three ships and an escort. Shortly after midnight, Balao went to battle stations and closed for attack. After firing her six bow tubes at the lead ship, the submarine swung her stern toward the wing ships in the formation and fired her stern tubes. Balao heard several explosions at the expected times, as torpedo after torpedo struck home. One of the damaged ships trained a [...] gun on Balao, but a heavy internal explosion silenced the gun before Balao could be hit. The submarine could see nothing except heavy smoke in the target area, but radar watched as two [...] "pips" [...] disappeared from the screen. Balao lured the escort out of the target area in order to double <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for the third freighter. Radar and lookouts failed to locate the merchantman, so Balao returned to patrol the shipping lanes after a very successful attack. Postwar study of Japanese shipping records identified her victims as the 2,723-ton freighter Shoho Maru and the 6,803-ton passenger cargoship Akiuro Maru.|$|E
