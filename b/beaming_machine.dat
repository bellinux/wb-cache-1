50|$|Laser <b>beam</b> <b>machining</b> (LBM) is a {{non-traditional}} {{subtractive manufacturing}} process, {{a form of}} machining, in which a laser is directed towards the work piece for machining. This process uses thermal energy to remove material from metallic or nonmetallic surfaces. The laser is focused onto the surface to be worked and the thermal energy of the laser is transferred to the surface, heating and melting or vaporizing the material.

40|$|The cost {{of cutting}} hard-to-machine {{materials}} by conventional mechanical machining processes is high {{due to the}} low material removal rate and short tool life, and some materials are not possible to be cut by the conventional machining process at all.

Composite materials are highly promising materials for applications in the aeronautic, aerospace, automotive and marine industry, but their properties like brittleness, anisotropy and non-homogeneity make it a difficult to machine material by conventional machining methods.

As such one has to adopt experimental methods, which are cumbersome, time consuming, costly and at times not feasible. During such situations, optimization techniques like Genetic Algorithm (GA) {{can be used as}} it provides a cost effective method for solution of such complex problems. Unlike traditional optimization techniques, GA is a robust and performs well in multimodal optimization problems. Considering these advantages of GA, optimization of Nd:Yag Laser <b>beam</b> <b>machining</b> process is done using this technique. In this research work, the desired responses are minimum kerf taper and surface roughness. The process control parameters considered are Oxygen pressure, pulse width, pulse frequency and cutting speed. Experiments are designed and the mathematical models correlating the desired responses and the control parameters are established using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Finally, GA is applied to search the optimal parametric values for the optimal responses. Using Genetic Algorithm, minimum Kerf taper obtained is 0. 14695 ° which is 0. 313 ° less in magnitude than experimentally measured value. Also, minimum surface roughness predicted using GA is 1. 2625 µm which is 0. 3375 µm better in value compared to the experimental measured value. The average percentage prediction error of GA is found to be 3. 35 % for kerf taper and 4. 02 % for surface roughness.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} the engineering demands for precise interactive process {{planning for the}} manufacture of high precision in the manufacturing of 3 D micro- and nanoproducts. It outlines {{the development of a}} digital tool based on a haptics-based human–machine interface. This interface is underpinned using an empirical model derived from a series of experimental results obtained from a focused ion <b>beam</b> <b>machine</b> through a series of experiments, which produced the surface topographies of a number of micro- and nanograting arrays; these were systemically analysed to provide an underpinning empirical database, which could be accessed via the haptic process planning system. On accessing these data, highly accurate geometrical models are then input into a haptics human machine interface to emulate the focused ion <b>beam</b> <b>machining</b> process as defined by the customised fabrication parameters. The haptic planning system predicts and simulates the shape and form of the finished product profiles as the haptic device is passed across a virtual substrate. Once the simulation is complete and the outputs verified by the user, the system then automatically outputs a stream file to drive the focused ion beam process to produce the surface topographies required. The simulation results reveal that compared with trial and error method, the haptics-based simulation method is a reliable way to plan and optimise the fabrication parameters in design and manufacture of micro- and nanogratings by focused ion <b>beam</b> <b>machining</b> cost-effectively. This could potentially provide substantial lead time and cost reductions associated with these currently inherently expensive unit cost products as well as demonstrate a novel tool not only for the planning of nanomachining cutting sequences but also for the interactive design of such products. This work also highlights the benefits of an empirical model as a means of underpinning and supporting real-time haptics interaction, something not possible using more numerical-based techniques...|$|R
