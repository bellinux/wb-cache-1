40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{recently}} recognized that long-term infusions of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) {{as a substitute}} of human plasma may lead to deposits within the human skin and clinically induces severe pruritus in approximately one-third of the patients treated. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical features and pathophysiology of HES-induced itching. METHODS: Clinical data of 86 patients were analyzed retrospectively. Furthermore, 10 patients were followed prospectively, in whom we also performed routine laboratory tests, skin biopsies, allergological investigations (skin prick, <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> <b>test),</b> and substance P measurements in stimulated macrophages. RESULTS: Special features of HES-induced pruritus included long latency of onset and persistence. Noteworthy, itching is not always generalized. 30 % of patients present with localized pruritus. Symptoms were not relieved by antihistaminics. Accordingly, the <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> <b>test</b> after HES exposure was negative. Also, substance P release from macrophages was not increased following HES stimulation. Deposits were found mainly in macrophages and endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that pruritus in HES-infused patients is most likely not triggered by pruritogenic mediators. We support data from the recent literature, suggesting a direct stimulation of cutaneous nerves by HES deposits. In patients suffering from long-standing itching it seems important to consider previous HES exposure as a possible cause not only in generalized pruritus but also in localized symptoms...|$|E

We have studied {{the extent to which the}} route of sensitization influences allergen-specific IgE synthesis and local airway inflammation using a mouse model of allergic sensitization to the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1. Sensitization of BALB/c mice with recombinant (r) Bet v 1 was performed using intraperitoneal (IP), subcutaneous (SC) or aerosol (AS) sensitization protocols. Mice were analysed for allergen-specific serum antibodies by ELISA and IgE-dependent <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation.</b> Proliferative responses and cytokine production of splenocytes were measured upon Bet v 1 stimulation in vitro. Bronchoalveolar lavages were performed after airway challenge with aerosolized birch pollen extract for assessment of eosinophilic airway inflammation and local cytokine production in vivo. Highest allergen specific IgE levels and IgE-dependent <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> were achieved using the SC route. High IL- 5 production by spleen and lung cells was associated with pronounced eosinophilia in bronchoalveolar lavages. After IP sensitization, despite giving the highest IgG levels, only low IgE levels, <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> and IL- 5 production were seen. On the other hand, AS sensitization, resulting in the lowest systemic IgE and IL- 5 levels, led to a comparably strong airway inflammation as the SC route.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of rabbit basophils to antigens from Ixodes ricinus females {{has been studied}} by a <b>degranulation</b> <b>test.</b> Observations of <b>basophil</b> numbers and <b>degranulation</b> were made on the 6 th day of each of four sequential infestations. Maximal degranulation of cells was observed after challenge of cells with antigen at a concentration of 10 6 and 10 7 pg/ml. At these concentrations, during a 1 st infestation, 21. 8 and 23. 6 % of cells degranulated. During a 2 nd infestation, these percentages increased (34. 8 and 33. 8 %) and reached 59. 8 and 63. 8 % by the 4 th infestation. A plasma factor which partially blocks <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation,</b> is described. This was already present during the 1 st infestation, since in its presence the percentage of degranulation was reduced by 2. 8 and 4. 0 % respectively on challenge with 10 6 and 10 7 pg antigen/ml. Inhibition was maximal at the 4 th infestation (difference: 16. 5 and 20. 5 %). Basophil sensitization and inhibition of the degranulation are thus both progressive phenomena. After 10 – 15 infestations on four other rabbits, 75. 0 and 79. 8 % degranulation was obtained. The inhibition of degranulation by plasma was also greater (difference: 25. 5 and 27. 4 %).

40|$|Abstract. A {{number of}} studies have {{verified}} that minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) may result from the dysfunction of T cells and B cells, although the precise mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. It is widely recog-nized that MCNS is a T helper (Th) 2 -dominant glomerular disease caused by an imbalanced Th 1 /Th 2 immune response. Increased levels of the Th 2 cytokines, interleukin (IL) - 4 and IL- 13, have been demonstrated to be closely associated with disease activity. In addition, basophils can affect the Th 1 /Th 2 balance by enhancing the Th 2 response and impairing the Th 1 response, which are then involved in the development of numerous diseases. However, whether basophils are vital in the pathogenesis of MCNS remains unknown. Frequent posi-tivity of the human <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> <b>test</b> in patients with MCNS has been observed. Thus, basophils should be analyzed in order to determine their role in the pathogenesis of MCNS. Contents 1...|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{symptoms}} of immediate-type hypersensitivity (ITH) and specific IgE against Echinococcus granulosus antigens are frequently present {{in patients with}} hydatid cysts. In alveolar echinococcosis (AE) due to E. multilocularis, clinical manifestations related to ITH have never been reported. The IgE-dependent humoral immune response was evaluated in 30 patients with AE. Circulating specific IgE (sIgE) were determined with two different methods of radio-allergo-sorbent test. Serum sIgE were determined sequentially in 18 patients over 15 months. Specific IgE bound to circulating basophils were assessed with two tests in vitro, measuring specific degranulation and histamine release. The respective abilities of E. granulosus and E. multilocularis antigens to reveal bound and circulating IgE antibodies were also assayed. Despite the absence of clinical {{symptoms of}} ITH and the frequent lack of circulating sIgE, an immunological response involving IgE was always present in human AE: basophil-bound sIgE were revealed in every patient by histamine release and degranulation tests; these tests were constantly negative in control subjects. Echinococcus granulosus extracts were more effective for detecting circulating sIgE; however E. multilocularis antigenic preparation induced a histamine release significantly higher than E. granulosus extracts. These results suggest that IgE-dependent humoral immune response could {{play a role in}} the host-parasite relationship in AE. Moreover, the sensitivity of the tests used to detect basophil-bound sIgE was higher than that of the usual serological tests, and the <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> <b>test</b> could be used to confirm diagnosis of AE in endemic countries...|$|E
40|$|Test kit with antibodies, allergens and {{reagents}} for 100 tests. Please {{read the}} instructions carefully before use! SUMMARY and EXPLANATION This test kit allows the quantitative determination of <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> in heparinized human whole blood. It contains the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) as positive control, important allergens, a two-colour antibody reagent {{for assessing the}} activation of human basophilic granulocytes and necessary reagents. It determines the percentage of basophilic granulocytes which have degranulated after incubation with allergen or fMLP. The evaluation of <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> should be performed by flow cytometry. The detailed instructions result from specific experience and validation assays. Critical steps are in bold letters. A graphic summary of the test is attached. APPLICATIONS BASOTEST is intended for investigation of allergen induced activation of basophilic granulocytes. Basophilic granulocytes are the least common circulating leukocyte in blood and account for only 0. 5 - 1 % of the total white blood cell population (1 - 3).

40|$|AbstractIgE {{antibody-mediated}} allergies affect {{more than}} 25 % {{of the population}} worldwide. To investigate therapeutic and preventive effects of passive immunization with allergen-specific IgG antibodies on allergy in mouse models we used clinically relevant pollen allergens. In a treatment model, mice were sensitized to the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 and to the major grass pollen allergens, Phl p 1 and Phl p 5 and then received passive immunization with rabbit IgG antibodies specific for the sensitizing or an unrelated allergen. In a prevention model, mice obtained passive immunization with allergen-specific rabbit IgG before sensitization. Kinetics of the levels of administered IgG antibodies, effects of administered allergen-specific IgG on allergen-specific IgE reactivity, the development of IgE and IgG responses and on immediate allergic reactions were studied by ELISA, rat <b>basophil</b> leukaemia <b>degranulation</b> assays and skin testing, respectively. Treated mice showed an approximately 80 % reduction of allergen-specific IgE binding and <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> which {{was associated with the}} levels of administered allergen-specific IgG antibodies. Preventive administration of allergen-specific IgG antibodies suppressed the development of allergen-specific IgE and IgG 1 antibody responses as well as allergen-induced <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> and skin reactivity. Our results show that passive immunization with allergen-specific IgG antibodies is effective for treatment and prevention of allergy to clinically important pollen allergens in a mouse model and thus may pave the road for the clinical application of allergen-specific antibodies in humans...|$|R

40|$|Background: No {{strawberry}} allergen has so {{far been}} identified and characterized. Methods: Serum samples were collected from patients with a suggestive case history of adverse reactions to strawberry and other fruits. Extracts from fresh and frozen strawberries were analysed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blotting and mass spectrometry. Patient blood samples were analysed for inhibition of IgE binding and <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation.</b> Results: Several IgE-binding proteins could be detected. In {{more than half of the}} patient sera, a 20 / 18 -kDa doublet band was observed in Western blotting. These two bands were excised and analysed by mass spectrometry showing the presence of proteins belonging to the Bet v 1 family of allergens. Inhibition of the IgE binding to the 20 / 18 -kDa doublet was obtained by addition of two recombinantly expressed allergens belonging to the Bet v 1 family (Bet v 1 and Mal d 1) and strawberry protein extract. In a cell-based assay of patient blood samples, <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> could be induced by strawberry protein extract and by Bet v 1 and Mal d 1.

CIU patients' basophils display distinct altered FcεRIα-mediated degranulation. CIU patients with basophil histamine release in response to polyclonal goat anti-human IgE ≥ 10 % are classified as CIU responders (CIU-R) and < 10 % are CIU non-responders (CIU-NR). We compared the presence of autoantibodies to <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> phenotypes and to disease status (active or inactive). Sera were collected from non-CIU subjects and CIU subjects who participated in a longitudinal study of disease severity and had defined <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> phenotypes. Immunoenzymetric assays (IEMA) quantified IgG anti-FcεRIα and anti-IgE. IgG anti-FcεRIα antibody was detected in 57 % of CIU-R (n= 35), 55 % of CIU-NR (n= 29), and 57 % of non-CIU subjects (n= 23), whereas IgG anti-IgE was present in 43 % of CIU-R, 45 % of CIU-NR, and 30 % of non-CIU subjects. Both the autoantibody levels and the functional basophil phenotype remained stable in subjects with active disease (n= 16), whereas there was an enhancement in basophil function as subjects evolved {{into a state of}} remission (n= 6), which appears independent of the presence of autoantibody.

40|$|BackgroundChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is {{associated}} with local immunoglobulin hyperproduction {{and the presence of}} IgE antibodies against Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins (SAEs). Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease is a severe form of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in which nearly all patients express anti-SAEs. ObjectivesWe aimed to understand antibodies reactive to SAEs and determine whether they recognize SAEs through their complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or framework regions. MethodsLabeled staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) A, SED, and SEE were used to isolate single SAE-specific B cells from the nasal polyps of 3 patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Recombinant antibodies with “matched” heavy and light chains were cloned as IgG 1, and those of high affinity for specific SAEs, assayed by means of ELISA and surface plasmon resonance, were recloned as IgE and antigen-binding fragments. IgE activities were <b>tested</b> in <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> assays. ResultsThirty-seven SAE-specific, IgG- or IgA-expressing B cells were isolated and yielded 6 anti-SAE clones, 2 each for SEA, SED, and SEE. Competition binding assays revealed that the anti-SEE antibodies recognize nonoverlapping epitopes in SEE. Unexpectedly, each anti-SEE mediated SEE-induced <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation,</b> and IgG 1 or antigen-binding fragments of each anti-SEE enhanced degranulation by the other anti-SEE. ConclusionsSEEs can activate basophils by simultaneously binding as antigens in the conventional manner to CDRs and as superantigens to framework regions of anti-SEE IgE in anti-SEE IgE-FcεRI complexes. Anti-SEE IgG 1 s can enhance the activity of anti-SEE IgEs as conventional antibodies through CDRs or simultaneously as conventional antibodies and as “superantibodies” through CDRs and framework regions to SEEs in SEE–anti-SEE IgE-FcεRI complexes...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: PI 3 Ks are {{potential}} therapeutic targets in immune-inflammatory diseases. These studies aimed {{to investigate the}} safety, tolerability and PK profile of seletalisib, a selective inhibitor of PI 3 Kδ in humans. Methods: these phase I, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre studies (NCT 02303509, NCT 02207595) evaluated single and multiple oral doses of seletalisib (5 - 90 mg QD and 30 mg BID) in healthy adults and subjects with mild-to-moderate psoriasis (Study- 1). Pharmacodynamic effects on markers of inflammation were assessed via changes in ex vivo <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> and histological assessment of psoriatic skin biopsies. Results: seletalisib was well tolerated at doses ≤ 15 mg (Study- 1) and ≤ 45 mg QD (Study- 2) for 14 days. No safety concerns or dose-limiting toxicities were identified (Study- 1). Incidence of gastrointestinal-related AEs was not dose related but higher incidences of rash AEs were associated with higher-dose seletalisib (Study- 2 rash AEs: 18 in 12 seletalisib-treated subjects versus 1 in 1 placebo-treated subject). Mean seletalisib plasma concentration-time profiles increased with increasing doses after single and multiple dosing, with no major deviations from dose-proportionality. There was no unexpected accumulation or loss of exposure after multiple dosing (time-independent pharmacokinetic profile). Apparent t 1 / 2 values were supportive of once-daily dosing (geometric mean t 1 / 2 : Study- 1, 17. 7 - 21. 1 h; Study- 2, 18. 1 - 22. 4 h).

A 3 -fold decrease in potency was observed in rat basophils (IC 50 = 323 nM) compared with human basophils, but a similar species potency shift was not observed in B cells...|$|R
40|$|Background: The house {{dust mite}} (HDM) {{allergen}} Der p 13 {{could be a}} lipid-binding protein able to activate key innate signaling pathways in the initiation of the allergic response. We investigated the IgE reactivity of recombinant Der p 13 (rDer p 13), its lipid binding activities and its capacity to stimulate airway epithelium cells. Methods: Purified rDer p 13 was characterized by mass spectrometry, circular dichroism, fluorescence-based lipid binding assays and in-silico structural prediction. IgE binding activity and allergenic potential of Der p 13 were examined by ELISA, <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> assays and in-vitro airway epithelial cell activation assays. Results: Protein modeling and biophysical analysis indicated that Der p 13 adopts a β barrel structure with a predominately apolar pocket representing a potential binding site for hydrophobic ligands. Fluorescent lipid binding assays confirmed that the protein is highly selective for ligands and that it binds a fatty acid with a dissociation constant typical of lipid transporter proteins. The low IgE binding frequency (7...|$|R
40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunoelectrotransfer blot for {{the diagnosis}} of human hydatid disease was performed, and the different antibody responses were analyzed by a discriminant analysis. This multivariate technique gave us, first, a selection {{of the most important}} responses against Echinococcus granulosus infection and, second, a procedure for the classification of patients into two groups: patients with hydatid disease and patients without a history of hydatid disease. This method was applied to 67 patients, 25 with active hydatid cysts (24 hepatic and 1 pulmonary) and 42 without a history of hydatid disease and was compared with the results obtained by conventional serology: indirect hemagglutination, latex particle agglutination, and <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation.</b> An immunoelectrotransfer blot coupled to a discriminant analysis was more sensitive than conventional serological diagnosis and detected 100 % of patients with an active hepatic hydatid cyst with a specificity of 100 %. This method, however, failed to detect an uncomplicated hyaline pulmonary hydatid cyst...|$|R
40|$|The anaphylatoxin C 5 a is {{a potent}} trigger for <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulations,</b> but in {{contrast}} to IgE-dependent basophil activation, it does not result in the synthesis of sulfidoleukotrienes (leukotriene C 4 /D 4 /E 4). Thus, degranulation and the generation of lipid mediators are separately regulated cellular responses. Exposure of human blood basophils to the cytokine IL- 3 alone does not induce the release of histamine in cells from most donors and never leads to the generation of LTC 4, indicating that IL- 3 is not a direct agonist for basophil mediator release. However, preincubation of basophils with IL- 3 enhances the degranulation response to C 5 a. Most importantly, IL- 3 "primes" basophils to release large amounts of leukotriene C 4 after challenge with C 5 a (mean of 50 gp LTC 4 per nanograms cellular histamine), while neither peptide alone is capable of inducing the formation of bioactive lipids. This effect is dose dependent, occurring at IL- 3 concentrations considerably lower than are required to stimulate the growth of bone marrow progenitor cells. IL- 3 affects the extent but not {{the time course of}} <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation,</b> and leukotriene release of cells sequentially exposed to IL- 3 and C 5 a occurs very rapidly concomitant with degranulation. A preincubation of the basophils with IL- 3 is strictly required for C 5 a-induced LTC 4 synthesis, but not for an enhancement of degranulation. Priming for C 5 a- induced lipid mediator generation occurs rapidly after exposure of the cells to IL- 3, starting at 1 min and reaching maximal effects at 5 min, but this altered state of responsiveness is relatively long lasting. Cell fractionation studies indicate that the basophil is the source of lipid mediators and that IL- 3 affects the basophil response directly. This study demonstrates that IL- 3 {{is a potent}} modifier of effector functions of mature basophils; this is possibly of greater in vivo significance than its growth factor properties. The large amounts of LTC 4 formed after triggering of IL- 3 -primed basophils may not only enhance but also qualitatively change the pathophysiological consequences of complement activation, and this might be important in the pathogenesis of immediate type hypersensitivity reactions, shock syndromes, and inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Polyphenols {{contained}} in FGM from Negroamaro (N) and Koshu (K) Vitis vinifera {{have been shown}} to exhibit several immunomodulating activities. For instance, mice affected by experimental colitis when administered with K-FGM showed an attenuation of the inflammatory process. In murine asthma, K-FGM reduced IgE production and eosinophil number in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid. In vitro, both N- and K-FGM were able to induce T regulatory cells in terms of Foxp- 3 molecule expression and release of interleukin- 10. In another set of experiments both N- and K-FGM were able to balance rate of proliferation/apoptosis/necrosis of normal human peripheral lymphocytes, thus indicating the property of these compounds to maintain immune homeostatic mechanisms in the host. On the other hand, N- and K-FGM inhibited human <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation,</b> thus, confirming our previous results obtained with rat basophilic leukemia cells. Finally, N- and K-FGM also decreased oxidative burst of human polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes. Taken together, these findings imply the potential clinical usefulness of FGM administration in inflammatory/allergic conditions, such as chronic asthma...|$|R
40|$|Background Anti-idiotypic {{antibodies}} (anti-Ids) {{to specific}} IgE antibodies are formed spontaneously during an anti-allergen immune response {{and can be}} induced by immunotherapy. Although anti-Ids can down-regulate the production of IgE antibodies, at least in experimental models, their possible role in the modulation of target cell reactivity remains ill-defined. Objective The capacity of human anti-Ids to modulate the release of histamine was examined in an in vitro system of human <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation.</b> Anti-Ids were prepared from the serum of six Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp) -hypersensitive patients suffering from atopic dermatitis and {{who had never been}} desensitized. Basophils were obtained from the blood of atopic donors. The extent of histamine release was determined using a fluorometric assay. Results We show that anti-Ids trigger the release of histamine in an allergen-specific, dose- and IgE-dependent manner; the release is not due to the presence of allergen and/or anti-IgE antibodies; and that the degranulating activity can be removed by absorption with affinity-purified anti-Dp antibodies of the corresponding patient. Conclusion These results indicate that spontaneously produced human anti-Ids can modulate the reactivity of human basophils...|$|R
40|$|Basophils are an {{infrequent}} type of leukocyte {{that bear}} high affinity IgE receptors, contain important amounts ofhistamine in their granules, and {{are capable of}} generating high levels of sulfidoleukotrienes. They are activated after IgE receptor crosslinking, and their products lead to the well-known signs of immediate-type hypersensitivity (1). Basophils are also activated by IgE-independent mechanisms, and may thus contribute to nonallergic inflammatory responses. So far two well-defined chemotactic peptides, the anaphylatoxin C 5 a and the bacterial product analogue FMLP, {{have been shown to}} induce <b>basophil</b> <b>degranulation</b> (1, 2). In addition, several cell-derived factors have been repeatedly implicated in basophil activation. However, up to now no defined and pure cytokine was found to have a potent and consistent histamine-releasing activity for basophils incubated in physiological buffers (3, 4). NAF/NAP- 1 is a novel neutrophil-activating peptide that was originally isolated from the culture fluids of stimulated human monocytes (5 - 7), and was subsequently shown to be produced by a variety of different cells (reviewed in reference 8). Like C 5 a and FMLP, NAF/NAP- 1 activates human neutrophils, inducing chemotaxis...|$|R
