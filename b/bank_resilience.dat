We identify banks with different strategies and different characteristics before the slowdown and investigate their risk profile {{before and during the}} downturn with market-based measures such as the Q-ratio, the Sharpe ratio and the betas for relevant risk exposures. We find that bank returns and risks differ across countries and institutional types. Diversified banks were hit harder than their specialized peers. Banks with a focus on local lending and banks with relatively high interest margins seem to have benefited from that focus. Banks with higher levels of capital are not only viewed by the stock market as less risky, they also produce superior returns during a downturn. This underscores the importance of Basle-type capital adequacy rules for the systemic stability of the banking system. Finally, we find that neither size nor hedging offer a structural protection against adverse economic conditions. 1 Bank risks {{and the business}} cycle...|$|E

40|$|Bank {{leverage}} ratios {{have made}} an impressive and largely unopposed return; they are mostly used alongside risk-weighted capital requirements. The reasons for this return are manifold, {{and they are not}} limited to the fact that bank equity levels {{in the wake of the}} global financial crisis (GFC) were exceptionally thin, necessitating a string of costly bailouts. A number of other factors have been equally important; these include, among others, the world's revulsion with debt following the GFC and the eurozone crisis, and the universal acceptance of Hyman Minsky's insights into the nature of the financial system and its role in the real economy. The best examples of the causal link between excessive debt, asset bubbles, and financial instability are the Spanish and Irish banking crises, which resulted from nothing more sophisticated than straightforward real estate loans. Bank leverage ratios are primarily seen as a microprudential measure that intends to increase <b>bank</b> <b>resilience.</b> Yet in today's environment of excessive liquidity due to very low interest rates and quantitative easing, bank leverage ratios should also be viewed as a key part of the macroprudential framework. In this context, this paper discusses the role of leverage ratios as both microprudential and macroprudential measures. As such, it explains the role of the leverage cycle in causing financial instability and sheds light on the impact of leverage restraints on good bank governance and allocative efficiency...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theoretical framework}} in which asset linkages in a syndicated loan agreement can infect a healthy bank when its partner bank fails. We investigate how capital constraints affect {{the choice of the}} healthy bank to takeover or liquidate the exposure held jointly with the failing bank, and how the bank’s ex ante optimal capital holding and possibility of contagion are affected by anticipation of bail-out policy, capital requirements and the joint exposure. We identify a range of factors that strengthen or weaken the possibility of contagion and bailout. Recapitalization with common stock rather than preferred equity injection dilutes existing shareholder interests and gives the bank a greater incentive to hold capital to cope with potential contagion. Increasing the minimum regulatory capital does not necessarily reduce contagion, while the requirement of holding conservation capital buffer could increase the <b>bank’s</b> <b>resilience</b> to avoid contagion...|$|R
40|$|Using a broad dataset of {{individual}} consolidated data of French banks {{over the period}} 1993 - 2007, we seek to evaluate the sensitivity to adverse macroeconomic scenarios of the three main sources of banking income, namely interest margins, fees and commissions, and trading income. First, we show that the determinants of banking income subcomponents are highly specific: whereas interest rates spread {{plays a significant role}} in determining net interest income, stock market measures are significant determinants of trading income. GDP growth impacts significantly on fees and commissions. Second, our macroeconomic stress testing exercises tend to show that fees and commission {{and to a lesser extent}} trading incomes are much more sensitive to some adverse macroeconomic shocks than interest income. This could support the view that income diversification is associated with higher <b>banking</b> revenue <b>resilience.</b> <b>Banking</b> income, Interest margins, Fees and commissions, Trading income, Dynamic panel estimation. ...|$|R

30|$|We {{decided to}} return to this data set for two main reasons. First, the unusually {{detailed}} information contained in the data set, the large geographic spread of the sites, and the timing of the study covering a drought and recovery period make it possible to conduct detailed analysis that is applicable to a large multi-ethnic sample of households in African drylands under conditions of drought and recovery. For the purposes of assessing pastoral resilience in the face of climate shocks, the data set is particularly suited to the task and also {{as far as we know}} the only data set of this kind currently available. Second, some in-depth analysis of the data from a livelihood perspective has already been conducted (McPeak et al. 2012), making it possible to contrast insights from a livelihood perspective with insights from a resilience perspective. For these reasons, we decided to analyse this data set to test the utility of the World <b>Bank</b> <b>resilience</b> framework. In so doing, we fully recognize that a significant amount of time has passed since the data were gathered and that major changes have occurred in the area such as transport infrastructure improvement, the rapid spread of cell phone networks, and larger changes in the political economy of both Kenya and Ethiopia. We turn to some of these developments near the closing of the paper when considering resilience-enhancing opportunities in the study area. However, we anticipate that much of the main argument positing that risk exposure and resilience are experienced differently by different kinds of households within dryland areas, and that this matters for resilience programming in dryland areas, remains valid if perhaps in need of updating and refining should more current multi-site household data sets become available.|$|E

Our findings illustrate that capital-based measures are transmitted both via their impact on the <b>banking</b> system's <b>resilience</b> and via indirect macro-financial feedback effects. The feedback effects relate to dampened credit and asset price growth and, depending on how banks move to higher capital ratios, can account for up to a half of the overall effectiveness of capital- based measures. Moreover, we document significant cross-country spillover effects, especially for measures implemented in larger countries. Overall, our model helps to understand how and through which channels changes in capitalization affect bank lending and the wider economy and can inform policy makers on the optimal calibration and timing of capital-based macroprudential instruments...|$|R

This paper addresses the issue of namely which macroeconomic indicators {{that are capable of}} signaling adverse shocks towards the <b>resilience</b> of Islamic <b>banking</b> in Indonesia.

The results suggest that there are several indicators that (1) IBRI, which is composed from standardized deposit and financing, is able to figure out the <b>resilience</b> of Islamic <b>banking.</b> The <b>resilience</b> of Islamic <b>banking</b> was considered stable since the index was moving below the normal line during the global financial crises, and (2) Some selected macro financial indicators, M 2 /reserve (M 2 res), credit growth (CG), real effective exchange rate (REER), and inflation rate (INF) empirically show low noise to signal ratio. It means that these four variables are capable of signaling vulnerabilities due to adverse external shocks.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of <b>banking</b> system <b>resilience</b> by {{applying}} off-equilibrium statistical physics to a system of particles, representing the economic agents, modelled according to the theoretical foundation of the current banking regulation, the so called Merton-Vasicek model. Economic agents are attracted to each other to exchange `economic energy', forming a network of trades. When the capital level of one economic agent drops below a minimum, the economic agent becomes insolvent. The insolvency of one single economic agent affects the economic energy of all its neighbours which thus become susceptible to insolvency, being able to trigger a chain of insolvencies (avalanche). We show that the distribution of avalanche sizes follows a power-law whose exponent depends on the minimum capital level. Furthermore, we present evidence that under an increase in the minimum capital level, large crashes will be avoided only if one assumes that agents will accept a drop in business levels, while keeping their trading attitudes and policies unchanged. The alternative assumption, that agents will try to restore their business levels, may lead to the unexpected consequence that large crises occur with higher probability. ...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis emphasised {{the need for}} effective financial stability analyses and tools for detecting systemic risk. This paper looks at assessment of <b>banking</b> sector <b>resilience</b> through stress testing. We argue such analyses are valuable even in emerging economies that suffer from limited data availability, short time series and structural breaks. We propose a top-down stress test methodology that employs relatively limited information to overcome this data problem. Moreover, as credit growth in emerging economies tends to be rather volatile, we rely on dynamic approach projecting key balance sheet items. Application of our proposed stress test framework to the Russian banking sector reveals a high sensitivity of the capital adequacy ratio to the economic cycle that shows up in both of the two-year macroeconomic scenarios considered: a baseline and an adverse one. Both scenarios indicate the need for capital increase in the Russian banking sector. Furthermore, given that Russia’s banking sector is small and fragmented relative to advanced economies, the loss of external financing can cause profound economic stress, especially for medium-sized and small enterprises. The Russian state has a low public debt-to-GDP ratio and plays decisive role in the banking sector. These factors allow sufficient fiscal space for recapitalisation of problematic banks under both of our proposed baseline and adverse scenarios. stress testing; bank; Russia...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{document}} leverage, {{capital and}} liquidity ratios of banks in Canada. These ratios are important indicators {{of different types}} of risk with respect to a bank's balance-sheet management. Particular attention is given to the observations by different types of banks, including small banks that historically received less attention. In addition, the authors compare leverage and capital ratios for banks in Canada and the United States in the period leading up to the recent crisis. They find that in Canada, most of the risks indicated by these balance-sheet ratios are concentrated among large banks that are more likely able to withstand shocks due to their diversified portfolios. Some smaller banks, however, reveal vulnerability against liquidity risks. Regarding a Canada-U. S. comparison, small U. S. banks show more vulnerability than their larger counterparts, as well as an increasing trend in vulnerability prior to the crisis.

40|$|Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The recent {{financial}} crisis revealed major critical issues at joint stock banks’ boards and governance while co-operative <b>banks</b> showed higher <b>resilience.</b> Do co-operative <b>banks</b> suffer from board deficiencies less than joint stock banks?. To answer this question, we analyse banks operating in Italy {{during the time}} span 2006 - 2012 to verify whether the governing bodies of co-operative banks are less effective in carrying out their duties than those of joint stock banks. Deficiencies of governing body are measured by sanctions imposed by the Supervisory Authority. Research Findings/Insights: Findings revealed that {{the board of directors}} (BoDs) of cooperative banks were sanctioned more compared to BoDs of joint stock banks. Furthermore it emerged that board turnover mediate the relationship between cooperative model and board deficiencies. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical evidence in support of theories that emphasize the weakness of corporate governance in co-operative banks. Methodologically, the novelty of our approach is the adoption of a measure of board effectiveness/deficiency based on a third-party independent perspective (regulatory body), which is not biased by the different objective function as well the different incentive structure of the two types of banks. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The findings have several policy and managerial implications. We contribute to the on-going debate on the proposal for flexible regulation on corporate governance for cooperative banks and underline that policy-makers and regulators have to rethink the corporate governance structures of co-operative banks. In addition, the study focuses on specific intervention that can be undertaken at bank level to reduce board deficiencies...|$|R

It is here, at the southern limit of the species distribution along the western Atlantic, that the probability of population loss may be high {{and the importance of}} a seed <b>bank</b> in the <b>resilience</b> and recovery of these populations great. Experimental results indicate that viability of both NC and CB seeds decreased significantly after just 6 months in the sediment following the seasonal period of maximum germination and continued to decline over time with no seeds viable remaining in CB cores and < 5 % of seeds remaining viable after 15 months in NC treatments. In these experiments time was the overriding factor affecting the persistence Z. marina seed banks for all treatments in both NC and CB and viability was not significantly affected by seed source, site, or sediment type. Based on the results of the in situ experiments, mixed-annual and perennial Zostera marina populations in North Carolina and perennial populations in Virginia produce transient seed banks (seeds viable < 12 months). The lack of a persistent seed bank may reduce the resilience of Z. marina at the limits of the species distribution to repeated stress events. As a result these populations may be particularly susceptible to disturbance with only a limited capacity for recovery if sexual reproduction is impaired...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – to {{evaluate}} the general networking and simulation approaches of modelling of systemic risk and the financial contagion {{and their ability to}} assess the <b>banking</b> sector <b>resilience</b> in the case of external economic shocks and collapse of idiosyncratic financial institutions. Design/methodology/approach – a general overview of research papers presenting concepts and methodologies of assessment of systemic risk of the banking sector. Findings – limitations of the networking approach and possible ways to improve modelling of systemic risk. The network approach cannot explain the causes of initial default of bank. On the other hand, assumptions made on LGD and interbank exposures are very strong. These features are important limitations of network and simulation approaches. Research limitations/implications – the application of reviewed methods in the case of Lithuanian banking sector falls, however, {{due to the lack of}} exhaustive data. On the other hand, until now, applied methods for systemic risk due to the lack of data have been limited. Also, because of this reason, there are difficulties to create adequate dynamic assessment for systemic risk models. Therefore, in assessing systemic risk of the banking sector, the same problem remains: is it possible to parameterize the financial crisis, its spread and speed and other characteristics according to quantitative methods. Knowing the liquidity, credit risk and other standards set in Basel Accords, it is also not enough to properly manage the systemic risk of the whole banking sector because for the proper activity of the banking sector not only characteristics related to capital requirements have influence on it, but also external (mostly the macroeconomic, political) factors. Practical implications – determination of the explicit connection based on quantitative methods determining the systemic risk of the banking sector would be exact and objective assessment and useful not only for the banking executives providing business trends, identifying potential sources of risk in the near future, but also for the rest part of society, both ordinary citizens and entrepreneurs with current accounts and deposits in banks. Originality/value – in essence, modelling of the systemic risk and analysis of instability causes of the banking sector applying reliable quantitative methods in Lithuania are not sufficiently developed. Researchers in other countries have established that a high threat of systemic risk is concentrated in the interbank market; many researches have been done to assess this risk, however, problems related to assessment of systemic risk and application of models always occur. The most common problem is the lack of information and assumptions, and constantly changing economic environment: emerging (or which may arise) new types of transactions, the new banking regulatory conditions and other financial innovations. First, whether the country’s banking business is so dependent on each other to create the threat of the systemic risk between banks’ assets and liabilities. Second, the banking sectors of the Baltic states are essentially controlled by large foreign banking groups, so there is no doubt that the international financial groups’ liquidity problems could spill over to other banks in the Baltic states. On the other hand, a question remains essentially and completely unexplored: how and why such problems could spill over in the Baltic Sea region countries? Also, little attention has been paid to the reliability of interbank payment systems and to the analysis of this object as a potential source of systemic risk.

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the case of}} modernising the Southern African Development Community (SADC) regional payments system facilitated by the SADC Payment System Project. The long-term objective is to have harmonised cross-border and inter-bank settlement systems to facilitate the economic activity such as supporting the flow of trade within the SADC region. The SADC Payment System Project purports to have adopted a strategic management process to achieve its mandate. The modernisation process {{is in line with}} the Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP). The aim of the RISDP is to provide strategic direction with respect to various SADC programmes and activities and to align the strategic objectives and priorities of SADC with the policies and strategies for achieving its long-term goals. The concept of payment, clearing and settlement system is explained to provide the context within which the national payment system fits in the economic system and its role towards economic development. The first objective of the study is to discuss the strategic management process. The objective of the discussion is to reflect how the strategic management theoretical constructs were translated into practice. The second objective of the study is to explore the environmental and country internal factors that are likely to impact on and delay the fully harmonised regional cross-border and inter-bank settlement systems. Although not exhaustive, the identified factors include; - The structural arrangements of country- specific teams that support the modernisation initiatives, - The availability of skills and capacity to harness the implemented systems within each member country in the SADC region. iii - The influence of foreign fund donors, {{as a result of a}} possible duplication of efforts, - The repair state of power supply and communication networks, - The supporting legal and regulatory regimes, - The forms of economic systems, - The influence and the extent of trade flows with the SADC region, and - The <b>resilience</b> <b>banking</b> networks in the facilitation of financial information flows within each member country and externally (internationally). The target population of central bank officials who also take an active role in the modernisation of SADC regional payments systems were requested to provide feedback on the prepared questionnaire to address the above factors. The responses provided are summarised in Chapter 5. It was clear from the responses that the identified factors appeared to pose little challenge for respective member countries. However, additional comments by respondents indicated that there is still a lot of groundwork to be covered. There was an evidence of the need for on-going training in payment systems and to improve communication networks and power supply within each member country, especially on the remote country areas/rural areas. Some members also hinted a warning on developing systems, which would have a potential to become white elephants if other sectors are not developed in parallel to the regional payment systems.

40|$|Although risk {{management}} in Islamic banking {{is one of}} the major as well as controversial issues of the sector, it is still an under-researched area of study. A lot of uncertainties still exist in {{risk management}} in Islamic banking, for which the answers are not yet necessarily clear, but which will play a part in shaping the industry’s future. Effective risk management in Islamic banking, thus, deserves priority attention: unless the industry develops its own genuine risk management architecture, it cannot achieve the dynamism that provides the viability needed for a more resilient financial system than the failing Wall Street model. Therefore, the study of risk management issues of the Islamic banking industry is an important but complex area. This study, hence, explores and analyses risk management practices in the Islamic banking industry through the perceptions of participants who were drawn from the banking and finance industry. The research maps out the opinions and attitudes towards risk and locates the practices of the industry related to risk management. This study provides an up-to-date overview of current market practices, issues, and trends in risk management for Islamic banks. It focuses on practical applications and discusses a wide range of unique risks facing Islamic banks from the perspective of different range of practitioners. To fulfil the aims of the research study, first, the present thesis analyses a number of issues concerning the subject using secondary data. Second, the unique risks facing Islamic banks and the perceptions of banking professionals regarding these risks are surveyed through a questionnaire. The final survey sample comprised 72 surveys from 18 countries. The data were analysed using various statistical analysis techniques ranging from simple frequency distribution analysis to the more advanced analyses such as non-parametric statistical analysis, factor analysis, and MANOVA multivariate analysis of variance. Third, semi-structured interviews were subsequently conducted with 33 leading Islamic banking professionals from 9 countries in order to develop an in-depth understanding of the underlying issues. Focused coding technique is used to analyse and sort the findings. In general, the findings from this study identified weaknesses and vulnerabilities among Islamic banks in the area of risk management and governance. Risk management, monitoring, reporting, and mitigation need to be enhanced across the entire industry. The study has also shown that the majority of respondents consider liquidity, asset-liability management, and concentration risks as the top risks facing Islamic banks. In addition, regional risk perceptions were crystallized by conducting inferential statistical analysis. The findings also show that, although Islamic <b>banks</b> have shown <b>resilience,</b> they are not immune to financial shocks. The study asserts that the root drivers of the prevailing financial system have to be challenged and replaced by a more transparent and ethical alternative, for which Islamic finance is a serious yet underdeveloped option. The real issue in Islamic banking is the excessive reliance on form at the expense of substance. It should also be noted that the findings of the study have policy-making implications which could benefit regulators, policy makers, Shari’ah scholars, practitioners, academia, and institutional stakeholders. Furthermore, this study has filled a gap in the literature by empirically exploring risk management issues from an Islamic banking perspective...|$|R
