5|$|In January 1960 McClory visited Fleming's Jamaican home Goldeneye, where Fleming {{explained}} his intention of delivering the screenplay to MCA, with a recommendation {{from him and}} Bryce that McClory act as producer.

5|$|According to {{personal}} {{accounts of the}} battle, after dismounting Dodge offered his men a chance to <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation. No one opted out, and 21 men advanced with Dodge in an extended firing line, unsure of the enemy's location. The remaining eight soldiers were posted as guards on high grounds and near the horses. Unlike the disorganized and undisciplined troops at Stillman's Run, the volunteers at Horseshoe Bend adhered to military discipline; they waited for Dodge to give the order before they entered the thicket and swampland in search of their enemy, and once searching they awaited their commander's order to attack.|$|E
5|$|After some desperate {{fighting}} in close action, pressure eased somewhat and some lost ground was recovered, but the Ottoman force began to outflank the mounted brigade to the west. The 5th Battalion, Norfolk Regiment were {{driven out of}} Shilta, but infantry from the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, {{in the process of}} being relieved, returned to the front, closed the gap, and pushed the Ottoman soldiers <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lines of communication.|$|E

After American was completely backed out, West Gate began rapidly settling and was ordered abandoned. A total of seven men from West Gate died in the accident—two when their lifeboat capsized, and a further five that probably died in the initial impact. West Gates commanding officer, Lt. Cdr. R. B. Vandervoort, and six men he had personally escorted to a life raft were picked up by one of Americans lifeboats at 06:00, after some 3½ hours in the water. The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships does not report any casualties on American from the collision.|$|E

The 60th Division held Tulkarm and Anebta, the 7th (Meerut) Division held the village of Beit Lid and controlled the crossroads at Deir Sheraf, while the 5th Light Horse Brigade had cut the Jenin railway south of Arrabe. Both the 3rd (Lahore) and 7th (Meerut) Divisions had continued to force the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies' retreat.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} 20 years of settlement, {{there was only}} limited contact between the {{settlers}} and Aboriginal people. Joseph Franklin purchased land in the Brindabellas in 1849 and attempted {{to set up a}} cattle farm. His livestock were slaughtered by the local Aboriginal people and he was driven <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains. The rush of prospectors into the Kiandra area through the Brindabellas and the mountains {{to the west of the}} ACT as a result of the Kiandra goldrush led to conflict with the Aboriginal people. By the time Franklin returned to the Brindabellas in 1863, the indigenous population had been significantly reduced.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the cemetery's operation, the {{locomotives}} hauling the funeral trains from Waterloo would not travel down the branch into the cemetery, as it would leave the engine at the wrong end of the train for the return journey. Instead, the train would stop immediately after passing Necropolis Junction, and the carriages would be uncoupled from the engine. A team of black horses would then haul the carriages down the sloping branch line to the two cemetery stations. While the train was on the branch line the engine would be repositioned so as to be at the front of the train once the horses drew it <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> branch and onto the main line.|$|E

Ormerod was forced to step down, as new business figures took control behind the scenes and began to sign promising young Scottish players. New manager Tom Maley was more willing than his predecessor to confront Meredith over his tendency to stray out of position and attempt to dominate the City attack.|$|E

5|$|During {{this second}} tour, Schwarzkopf noted two {{incidents}} which haunted him. On February 17, 1970, {{two men in}} C Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry were killed by friendly fire from an American artillery shell that had been ordered by Schwarzkopf, but which had struck a tree near their position {{on its way to}} a target. The parents of one soldier blamed him for the death of their son, a claim which Schwarzkopf strongly denied and termed an accident of war. On May 28, 1970, Schwarzkopf landed his helicopter when discovering troops of B Company who had stumbled into a minefield. Two company officers had been wounded and two soldiers were trapped, fearful of setting off more mines. Although a medevac was on its way, Schwarzkopf ordered his UH-1 Huey to remove the wounded. As he attempted to help the troops <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field, one soldier struck a landmine, breaking a leg, and began to panic. Fearing he would set off another landmine, Schwarzkopf pinned the soldier to the ground while another soldier put a splint on the wounded man's leg. In doing so, another mine was set off, killing three and wounding Schwarzkopf's artillery officer.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{followed}} the disappointment of For Your Eyes Only with Thunderball, the novelization {{of a film}} script on which he had worked with others. The work had started in 1958 when Fleming's friend Ivar Bryce introduced him to a young Irish writer and director, Kevin McClory, and the three, together with Fleming and Bryce's friend Ernest Cuneo, worked on a script. In October McClory introduced experienced screenwriter Jack Whittingham to the newly formed team, and by December 1959 McClory and Whittingham sent Fleming a script. Fleming had been having second thoughts on McClory's involvement and, in January 1960, explained his intention of delivering the screenplay to MCA, with a recommendation from him and Bryce that McClory act as producer. He additionally told McClory that if MCA rejected the film because of McClory's involvement, then McClory should either sell himself to MCA, <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deal, or file a suit in court.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes {{started his}} career with Eastern Counties League Premier Division side Newmarket Town, where he came to {{prominence}} after scoring hat-tricks in three successive games in 2003. Rhodes scored 20 goals {{in the early part}} of the 2003/04 season, including 14 goals in 11 games in the league. After trials with several Football League clubs, he joined Brentford in November 2003 and scored the goal that ensured they were not relegated six months later. Rhodes scored five goals during his four seasons at Brentford, which were hampered by injury and included loan spells at Swindon Town and Grays Athletic. He signed for Bradford City in August 2007 but was released after one season, before joining Rotherham United. A loan spell at Woking was followed by his release from Rotherham in May 2009, when he dropped <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Football League to join Oxford United. He played just four games before leaving Oxford by mutual consent, and moved to Braintree Town, initially on a short-term deal. Rhodes rejoined Grays Athletic in January 2010, but was released at the end of the 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|The second film, The Only Girl in Camp, {{focuses on}} Trapper Gates's daughter, {{who is the}} only woman in the mining camp. Three ruffians come across the camp and plan to rob the miners.

All the miners are lured to the building, save the girl, and Bill's accomplices proceed to rob the men.

5|$|This failure {{prompted}} the German command to rethink its strategy. To reinforce {{the troops and}} replace the losses, additional personnel were transferred from the 163rd Infantry Division based in Southern Finland. With a combined effort by all the German forces, extensive air-support by Luftflotte 5, {{as well as a}} supportive flanking attack by the Finnish 6th Division, they finally broke through the Soviet defenses on 6 July and captured Salla. A heavy Soviet counterattack drove them <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town but on 8 July, a general Soviet retreat of the 122nd Rifle Division allowed the German forces to recapture the town. The Soviet troops had to leave most of their artillery behind and in the heavy fighting some 50 Soviet tanks were destroyed. In order not to lose momentum, the SS Division Nord pursued the 122nd Rifle Division toward Lampela, while the 169th Division turned east toward Kayraly. Meanwhile, the Finnish 6th Division was making good progress in its flanking manoeuvre to the east to circumvent Kayraly and Lape Apa.|$|E

5|$|Batista {{responded with}} an all-out-attack on Castro's guerrillas, Operation Verano (28 June to 8 August 1958). The army aerially bombarded forested areas and villages {{suspected}} of aiding the militants, while 10,000 soldiers {{under the command}} of General Eulogio Cantillo surrounded the Sierra Maestra, driving north to the rebel encampments. Despite their numerical and technological superiority, the army had no experience with guerrilla warfare or with the mountainous region. Now with 300 men at his command, Castro avoided open confrontation, using land mines and ambushes to halt the enemy offensive. The army suffered heavy losses and a number of embarrassments; in June 1958 a battalion surrendered, their weapons were confiscated and they were handed over to the Red Cross. Many of Batista's soldiers, appalled at the human rights abuses that they were ordered to carry out, defected to Castro's rebels, who also benefited from popular support in the areas they controlled. In the summer, the MR-26-7 went on the offensive, pushing the army <b>back,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain range and into the lowlands, with Castro using his columns in a pincer movement to surround the main army concentration in Santiago. By November, Castro's forces controlled most of Oriente and Las Villas, and tightened their grip around the capitals of Santiago and Santa Clara. Through control of Las Villas, the rebels divided Cuba in two by closing major roads and rail lines, severely disadvantaging Batista's forces.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the act of Union, the Kingdom of Scotland had a {{standing}} army of seven units of infantry, two of horse and one troop of Horse Guards, besides varying levels of fortress artillery in the garrison castles of Edinburgh, Dumbarton, and Stirling. Their role was of such importance that the Scots Parliament forced Queen Anne to give royal assent to the controversial 1704 Act of Security by threatening to withdraw Scottish forces <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confederate armies. The new British Army created by the Act of Union in 1707 incorporated existing Scottish regiments, such as the Scots Guards, The Royal Scots 1st of Foot, King's Own Scottish Borderers 25th of Foot, The Cameronians 26th of Foot, Scots Greys and the Royal Scots Fusiliers 21st of Foot. The new armed forces were controlled by the War Office and Admiralty from London. During this period, Scottish soldiers and sailors were instrumental in supporting the expansion of the British Empire and became involved in international conflicts, including the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–13), the Quadruple Alliance (1718–20), wars with Spain (1727–29) and (1738–48) and the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48). The first official Highland regiment to be raised for the British army was the Black Watch, the 43rd (later 42nd) regiment, in 1740. It marked the beginning of a major role for Highlanders within the British military structure, but the growth of Highland regiments was delayed by the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion and would not begin in earnest until the late 1750s.|$|E
5|$|Early morning 11 March, the LSSAH {{launched}} a two-prong attack into northern Kharkov. The 2nd Panzergrenadier Regiment, advancing from the Northwest, split up into two columns advancing towards northern Kharkov {{on either side}} of the Belgorod-Kharkov railroad. The 2nd Battalion, on the right side of the railroad, attacked the city's Severnyi Post district, meeting heavy resistance and advancing only to the Severenyi railway yard by the end of the day. On the opposite side of the railroad, the 1st Battalion struck at the district of Alexeyevka, meeting a T-34-led Soviet counterattack which drove part of the 1st Battalion <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. Only with aerial and artillery support, coming from Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers and StuG assault guns, were the German infantry able to battle their way into the city. A flanking attack from the rear finally allowed the German forces to achieve a foothold in that area of the city. Simultaneously, the 1st SS Panzergrenadier Regiment, with armor attached from a separate unit, attacked down the main road from Belgorod, fighting an immediate counterattack produced over the Kharkov's airport, coming on their left flank. Fighting their way past Soviet T-34s, this German contingent was able to lodge itself into Kharkov's northern suburbs. From the northeast, another contingent of German infantry, armor and self-propelled guns attempted to take control of the road exits to the cities of Rogan and Chuhuiv. This attack penetrated deeper into Kharkov, but low on fuel the armor was forced to entrench itself and turn to the defensive.|$|E
