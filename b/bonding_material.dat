Due to the indispensability, influences of <b>bonding</b> <b>materials</b> on the measurement accuracy {{need to be}} clarified. To analyze the sensing accuracy of the FBG strain sensor, a simplified longitudinal strain transmission model is established to discuss the transfer coefficient issue. Results indicate that hard <b>bonding</b> <b>materials</b> can enhance the sensing accuracy by high strain sensitivity. But on the other hand, asymmetric transversal stress model reveals that hard <b>bonding</b> <b>materials</b> {{can lead to the}} distortion of the spectrum in a large load condition. Then, effects of distorted spectra on the wavelength demodulation accuracy are studied by the simulation. The simulation shows that distorted spectra can reduce the wavelength demodulation accuracy markedly. It can be concluded that to improve the accuracy of strain measurements, hard <b>bonding</b> <b>materials</b> are suitable for small strain measurements, and relatively soft <b>bonding</b> <b>materials</b> are better options for large strain measurements...|$|R

50|$|Some common {{attributing}} {{factors to}} wheel {{can be caused}} by grain fracture, which can be advantages, is the results of a portion of each of the individual grains on the wheel surface breaking apart and leaving the remaining grain bonded to the wheel. The fractured grain is left with newly exposed sharp edges which attribute the self-sharpening characteristic of grinding wheels and cutting tools in general. Attritious wear or progressive wear which is typically undesirable leads to the grains dulling by developing flat spots and rounded edges on the wheel which can deteriorate the wheels ability to remove material. Flat spots also can lead to excessive heat generation with the added surface contact which and in turn enable Bond fractures or the brittle fracture of the adhesive bonds between the grains. The removal of these worn grains from the adhesive bonds restores the wheels cutting ability once more. Grinding wheels can also be characterized by the grains increased capacity to fracture according to a level of higher value of friability. Different bonding materials are used depending on the intended use of the grinding wheel. The <b>bonding</b> <b>material</b> is classified by its individual strength called its wheel grade.|$|E
