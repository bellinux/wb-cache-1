The arcade-style game Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis: The Action Game designed by Attention To Detail was released almost simultaneously with its adventure counterpart, and loosely follows its plot.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E

He {{appears to have been a}} compromise candidate, as he was at least a canon, if not the monk that the chapter had sought. William was the first Augustinian canon to become an archbishop in England, a striking break with the tradition that had favoured monks in the see of Canterbury. Although most contemporaries would not have considered there to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> distinction between monks and canons, William's election still occasioned some trepidation among the monks of the Canterbury chapter, who were [...] "alarmed at the appointment, since he was a clerk".|$|E
500|$|In 1972–73 Shero hired Mike Nykoluk as an {{assistant}} coach on a one-year tryout basis. Although assistant coaches are common today, Nykoluk was the first full-time assistant coach in the league, and the decision to hire him led to rumors that Shero must not <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coach if he needed help. However, with the additional help Shero guided the Flyers to their first winning season in franchise history, and Nykoluk stayed on as assistant throughout Shero's tenure. Prior to a game during the 72–73 season Shero wrote a quote about commitment on the dressing room blackboard, and the team won the game. From then on Shero wrote inspirational quotes prior to games. After finishing second in the West Division they faced off with the Minnesota North Stars whom they defeated 4-2 winning the first playoff series in Flyers history. [...] In the second round the Flyers matched up with the Montreal Canadiens, who defeated Philadelphia 4-1.|$|E
500|$|Keith Law, a {{minor league}} talent {{evaluator}} for ESPN, derided Asche as a prospect both offensively and defensively, noting that he likely would not <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> power hitter and was a questionable defender. Nevertheless, Baseball America rated Asche as the Phillies' seventh-best prospect after the 2012 season. After the 2012 season, another analyst wrote that Asche had an [...] "average" [...] body for a baseball player, commented that while he had limited power potential, {{he could be a}} solid contact hitter because of quick hands and [...] "incredibly sound" [...] hitting mechanics, but was a [...] "terrible" [...] defender with a [...] "fringy arm". Subsequently, however, he improved defensively to become [...] "passable". In 2013, Asche played for the Lehigh Valley IronPigs of the Class AAA International League (IL). He was named to the IL team in the Triple-A All-Star Game. After batting [...]295 with 15 home runs and 68 RBIs for Lehigh Valley, and being named their Player of the Month for July, the Phillies promoted Asche to the major leagues on July 30. One writer found it [...] "mildly surprising" [...] that the Phillies called up Asche rather than Maikel Franco, a fellow third base prospect who most thought had far more potential than Asche.|$|E

[...] The ball was passed down the line to English centre, Colin McFadyean, who kicked towards the halfway line. [...] The ball bounced once and was seemingly going in to touch. [...] Instead, Jarret sprinted onto the ball, taking it without breaking stride. He sprinted down the touchline, outflanking the whole of the astonished England defence, to score in the left corner. [...] He converted his own try from just inside the touchline. Besides scoring a try, he kicked two penalty goals and five conversions for a total of 19 points. [...] His performance on the field was so impressive that the match has been known ever since as the Keith Jarrett match and he made the cover of Rugby World magazine two months later. The try has been voted seventh in a poll of the top ten Welsh tries and he is listed on the Welsh Rugby Union Official Website as the scorer of the [...] "Greatest Ever Welsh try".|$|E
