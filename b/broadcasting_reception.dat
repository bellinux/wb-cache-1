In this framework, the rate adaptation policy {{is such that}} the target system data rate is a multiple of the capacity of an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The proportionality constant determines how aggressively the system scales the data rate and {{can be interpreted as}} a finite-SNR multiplexing gain. The diversity gain is given by the negative slope of the outage probability with respect to the SNR. The finite-SNR diversitymultiplexing tradeoff is characterized for three practical decode and forward half-duplex cooperative protocols with different amounts of <b>broadcasting</b> and simultaneous <b>reception.</b> For each configuration, system performance is computed as a function of SNR under a system-wide power constraint on the source and relay transmissions.

The {{purpose is to}} enable DVB-S reception in moving vehicles. Phased arrays are able to electronically track the desired signal during dynamic behaviour of the vehicle the array is mounted on. The proposed system uses blind beamforming to adapt the array steering vector to changing signal (conditions and) directions. Movement of the vehicle, the phased array is mounted on, leads to modulus and phase deviations at the beamformer output. An extended version of the Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) algorithm is used to adapt the steering vector weights to compensate for those deviations. For simulation of the proposed system a model of vehicle dynamics is used to generate realistic antenna data. Simulation of the proposed system based on this antenna data shows appropriate corrections for modulus and phase deviations...|$|R

40|$|In vehicle-to-vehicle safety messaging, {{periodic}} safety messages can be {{used for}} safety applications.

We describe our design as well as simulation using various repetition schemes under different packet error rates and compare our cross-layer collision correction method with non-collision correcting performance. Once implemented, this new approach can substantially improve the reception likelihood of safety messages, without loss of latency, and potentially make active vehicle safety applications more responsive...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedFirst used to {{describe}} a rematch of a tied sporting event, the term "replay" was extended {{in the early twentieth}} century to express the playback of a recording. Since this usage, the significance of the term and concept of replay has expanded considerably into a range of cultural, social, political, industrial, technological, and experiential practices. As such, replay resists simple classification and definition, and this dissertation unpacks the various meanings and implications of its instances and applications across several media forms. In particular, I interrogate the replay’s usage and significance in the United States through avant-garde filmmaking practices, television broadcasting, and the structures and play mechanics of video games.; I begin with a consideration of avant-garde film practitioners who have engaged with replay through multiple registers. Reliant on the unique relationship between cinema and reality, filmmakers use film’s capacity to record and replay for a range of investigations, including psychosexual examination and recontexualization of extant film. Throughout its industrial history, replay and repetition have played central roles in the production, distribution, exhibition, and experience of television. Emerging from the practices of radio <b>broadcasting</b> and <b>reception,</b> television’s structure has long emphasized regularized and predictable content structured into organized programming schedules. Additionally, specific modes of televisual broadcasting have been shaped by methods of textual replay, which alters events during their broadcast. The capacity for replay has increasingly passed into the viewer’s control, with the arrival of television technologies which provide users a degree of control over the stream of programming entering their home. A consideration of the bipartite nature of the ludic and the digital in the ontology of video games initiates my discussion of the replay in interactive media. After establishing this framework, I examine the multiple implementations and implications of the replay through several critical lenses. This exploration includes the consideration of the replay’s function as an industrial strategy, its ideological significance, and its evolving relationship with play itself. Ultimately, I contend that the replay at once contains and extends time and space, transforming the lived experience—and its register in memory and media—into a palimpsest...|$|R
40|$|CONFUSION and disarray {{surround}} Stephen Conroy 2 ̆ 7 s {{decision to}} rebate licence fees for commercial television broadcasters. The decision raises {{the most basic}} question that can be asked about government dispensation of any kind: what was this money for? Was the 250 million a subsidy, a tax break, or a quid pro quo? Was it a grant for local content, assistance for digital conversion, a political pay-off, or bailout money for an industry which Senator Conroy now says is in terminal decline? Whatever the answer, the result seems to prove the contention that the more you ask for, the less you need to explain. In fact, the confusion is not the senator 2 ̆ 7 s fault. He 2 ̆ 7 s not the first communications minister to give the networks generous rebates without {{much in the way}} of public discussion, and he won 2 ̆ 7 t be the last. The Coalition made precisely the same move a decade ago when the switch to digital began. The problem here is policy, not politics. Because this tax generates return for the government from a highly protected industry, the system has a certain rough, pragmatic utility. But it also creates problems, such as those encountered by Senator Conroy. Broadcasters use the spectrum to transmit their signals. The spectrum is a public resource, but broadcasters do not pay for it directly in the way others do. Mobile phone providers, for example, buy bits of spectrum at auctions run by the government. But broadcasters have been allocated spectrum without charge by the government 2 ̆ 7 s broadcasting regulator, according to its judgment of the viability of the broadcasting service and its need for spectrum. The logic of this system can be found in an era of <b>broadcasting</b> when <b>reception</b> equipment was cruder, when alternative delivery platforms did not exist, and when there were few alternative commercial uses of the spectrum. But things have changed. Already, better reception equipment minimises the need for buffer channels; with digital transmission, much more efficient spectrum allocations are possible. The result today, however, is that very substantial amounts of spectrum are used by a small number of television services. Instead of paying for spectrum, broadcasters pay the government an annual fee to be a broadcaster based on advertising revenue. This arrangement has survived because it has some advantages. First, TV advertising has been a good business, so the fee generates a substantial amount of public revenue, and governments need to get money from somewhere. Second, because the fee is based on revenue, it transfers some of the broadcasters 2 ̆ 7 risk to the government, so that in years when advertising activity is lower, the fees payable are also reduced. This makes some sense in an industry which seems particularly susceptible to ups and downs of economic cycles. It also makes the government 2 ̆ 7 s decision to rebate the fees even stranger. An industry that was genuinely in terminal decline would be paying less every year without special dispensations. The main problem with the fee is that it bears no relationship to the value of the spectrum being used. This means that it 2 ̆ 7 s not linked to any specific purpose: it floats between cultural, economic and communications policy objectives without being attached to anything. The problem is that a certain level of convenient ambiguity can easily become politically toxic. For instance, it isn 2 ̆ 7 t clear why this tax, and therefore the rebate, should apply to free-to-air TV, but not to pay-TV. Another example: because the fee is not linked to spectrum use, broadcasters have no incentive to make more efficient use of the spectrum by driving the digital conversion faster. Right now, another policy debate is going on. The government is considering what to do with the channels that will no longer be needed for broadcasting when analog shuts down in a few years. Most likely, these will be sold for mobile communications [...] 3 G and it successors [...] and the telecommunications companies that buy this spectrum will probably pay for it directly, through auctions or other means. The messy business of the rebate suggests another issue that should be tackled at the same time. The current licence fees have not served communications or the public interest well. There are better, and less politically risky, ways of charging businesses for the use of public resources. Auctions have become the vogue for spectrum licensing, but there are alternatives, such as the resource rents taxes levied in the mining sector. A modernised and more coherent regime would contribute a great deal to the government 2 ̆ 7 s aspirations for a vibrant, digital economy in Australia.

40|$|The broadcast/cellular {{cooperation}} for {{a common}} delivery of Mobile TV {{is at the heart}} of the emerging mobile broadcast technologies, namely the mobile extension of the second generation digital video <b>broadcasting</b> for terrestrial <b>reception</b> (DVB-T 2 Lite) and its follower DVB-Next Generation Handheld (DVB-NGH). These broadcast technologies aim to cooperate with the Long Term Evolution (LTE), as the latter is intended to be the bearer of Mobile TV thanks to its enhanced-Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service feature (e-MBMS). Even though the 3 GPP/DVB cooperation is not a new topic and was investigated with the introduction of the previous DVB technology, known as DVB-Handheld (DVB-H), most of the works addressing this issue considered a common service area covered by both DVB and cellular systems and focused solely on the impact of such cooperation in terms of capacity gains brought by 3 GPP and error repair gains brought by DVB. This strategy was judged to be expensive since a new and very dense DVB network was needed. In order to overcome this problem and decrease as much as possible the need for a new broadcast network, we propose in this thesis a hybrid DVB/LTE network with a coverage extension strategy, where the LTE system, planned for almost a universal coverage, is used to deliver Mobile TV in areas not covered by recent DVB-T 2 Lite (or eventually DVB-NGH) network. In this context, we explore two main issues: 1. Mobile TV services have to share LTE resources with other higher priority services such as voice traffic. The dynamicity of the latter will impact the Quality of Service (QoS) of Mobile TV. We propose a new QoS-based planning for the hybrid DVB/LTE so as to guarantee an acceptable watching experience without over-dimensioning the LTE system. We derive using Markov chain analysis and hitting time theory, several QoS metrics pertaining to mobile TV performance, such as interruption frequency and duration. 2. A new business model which clarifies the relationships between the different actors of the ecosystem namely DVB and LTE operators as well as the TV channel providers and constructs the service area from an economic point of view is needed. In fact, the absence of a clear and viable economic model that resolves the monetary conflicts between cellular and broadcast operators was one of the main drawbacks behind the failure of the first attempt of mobile TV delivery by cooperating UMTS/DVB-H. We develop in this thesis a profit sharing strategy for the cooperative network, using coalition game concept Shapley value and Nash equilibrium for a self-enforcing strategy. We further develop a new framework using real option theory coupled with coalition games for investment decision in mobile TV networks (whether an operator should enter the mobile TV market and, if yes, when to do so) and show how operators can incorporate the uncertainties related to demand and network operation costs. We propose a bi-level dynamic programming algorithm to solve numerically the developed real option game. La coopération entre les réseaux de diffusion classiques et les réseaux mobiles cellulaires pour une distribution commune de la télévision mobile est actuellement l'un des éléments clé discutés dans le cadre des nouvelles technologies de diffusion mobile; surtout l'extension mobile de la deuxième génération de diffusion de la télévision numérique terrestre (DVB-T 2 Lite) et son suiveur le DVB-Next Generation Handheld (DVB-NGH).
