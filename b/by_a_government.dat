5|$|A {{statutory}} {{board is}} an autonomous {{agency of the}} Government that is established by an Act of Parliament and overseen <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> ministry. Unlike ministries and government departments that are subdivisions of ministries, statutory boards are not staffed by civil servants and have greater independence and flexibility in their operations.|$|E
5|$|Courts {{and state}} legislatures also opined on the {{inappropriate}} uses of state seals and arms. Most states barred their use {{for any kind}} of advertising. Reproduction for corporate use was similarly prohibited and such infractions were classified as offenses against public property. The 2003 Code of Federal Regulations pertaining to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives prohibits the use of state seals or coats of arms in product branding so as not to mislead the public into thinking that a commercial product has been endorsed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> organization.|$|E
5|$|Debt service {{funds are}} used to account for money {{that will be used}} to pay the {{interest}} and principal of long-term debts. Bonds used <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> to finance major construction projects, to be paid by tax levies over a period of years, require a debt service fund to account for their repayment. The debts of permanent and proprietary funds are serviced within those funds, rather than by a separate debt service fund.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{picketing}} {{was banned}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Liberal <b>government</b> in the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1871 but then decriminalised <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Conservative <b>government</b> with the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875.|$|R

5|$|Each canton is {{controlled}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> unit called Municipalidad. The term {{reflects the fact}} that the cantons in Costa Rica have approximately the same function as municipios ("municipalities") in many other Spanish-speaking countries. This administrative unit consists of two bodies: a municipal executive (Concejo Municipal) and an executive body which only consists of a mayor (alcalde / alcaldesa municipal), a title that was introduced in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Few Privy Counsellors are {{required}} to attend regularly. The settled practice is that day-to-day meetings of the Council are attended by four Privy Counsellors, usually the relevant Minister to the matters pertaining. The Cabinet Minister holding the office of Lord President of the Council, currently the Rt Hon. Andrea Leadsom , invariably presides. Under Britain's modern conventions of parliamentary government and constitutional monarchy, every order made in Council is drafted <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Government</b> Department and has already {{been approved by the}} Minister responsible—thus actions taken by the Queen-in-Council are formalities required for validation of each measure.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{health care}} is {{provided}} by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance. Patients are free to select the physicians or facilities of their choice.|$|E

5|$|Running {{water and}} {{electricity}} are supplied {{at the national level}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> service provider, Jirama, which is unable to service the entire population. , only 6.8percent of Madagascar's fokontany had access to water provided by Jirama, while 9.5percent had access to its electricity services. 56% of Madagascar's power is provided by hydroelectric power plants with the remaining 44% provided by diesel engine generators. Mobile telephone and internet access are widespread in urban areas but remain limited in rural parts of the island. Approximately 30percent of the districts are able to access the nations' several private telecommunications networks via mobile telephones or land lines.|$|E
5|$|The car is {{tracked down}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> gunship. Canaris arrives and reveals he {{will let the}} virus {{continue}} {{as a form of}} population control and profit. Cally's blood is {{to be used as a}} vaccine for the virus. Cally and Stirling board the gunship, while Sinclair chooses to stay behind. Nelson flies into the quarantine zone to speak with Sinclair and she gives him a recording of the conversation, the evidence to bring down Canaris. The recording is later broadcast to the rest of the country. Sinclair retrieves Sol's head and returns to his gang. Looking at the head, the marauders cheer, accepting Sinclair as their new leader.|$|E
5|$|The expedition, {{named after}} its supply ship, {{was a private}} venture, financed by public {{contributions}} augmented <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> grant. It had further backing from the Admiralty, which released experienced seamen to the expedition, and from the Royal Geographical Society. The expedition's team of scientists carried out a comprehensive scientific programme, while other parties explored Victoria Land and the Western Mountains. An attempted landing and exploration of King EdwardVII Land was unsuccessful. A journey to Cape Crozier in June and July 1911 was the first extended sledging journey {{in the depths of}} the Antarctic winter.|$|E

5|$|The scheme has {{attracted}} criticism from various sources, and certain aspects and proposals {{have been particularly}} controversial. A planned 42-storey hotel and residential building on one block—which {{was not in the}} original plan and for which planning permission was later denied—was opposed by many local people and politicians, and was eventually rejected <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> minister on appeal. The decision to allow a large supermarket branch to be built {{in the middle of the}} development was also unpopular. A campaign group was formed to co-ordinate and raise the awareness of people's concerns.|$|E
5|$|A {{new system}} of {{controlling}} {{the movement of the}} First Nations was introduced by the government after the rebellion. Known as the pass system, this required any individual leaving a reserve to possess a pass signed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> agent, or to face arrest by the police. The police received advice that the new policy was illegal, as it contravened Treaty 7, which had given guarantees of free movement, but they continued to enforce it for several years. Eventually the force turned to the vagrancy laws as an alternative approach for removing First Nations from selected areas. Police used agents employed to collect intelligence from within First Nation and Métis communities, and, from 1887, they also employed members of the First Nations as special constables, typically deploying them as scouts and trackers. These scouts wore an informal uniform and were empowered to arrest other members of their communities, but not whites.|$|E
5|$|A {{statutory}} {{board is}} an autonomous {{agency of the}} Government that is established by an Act of Parliament and overseen <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> ministry. The Act sets out the purposes, powers and rights of the agency. Unlike ministries and government departments that are subdivisions of ministries, statutory boards may not be staffed by civil servants and have greater independence and flexibility in their operations. They are managed by boards of directors whose members usually include businessmen, professionals, senior civil servants and officials of trade unions. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF), the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the National Heritage Board (NHB), and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) are all statutory boards.|$|E

5|$|During the {{fighting}} in May 1940, the Pierlot government came into conflict with King Leopold III who had taken personal command of the Belgian Army. The first confrontation {{between the government and}} the King occurred on 10 May, when the King, against the wishes of the government, left for his military headquarters without addressing the Chamber of Representatives like his father, Albert I, had done in 1914. Contact between the King and the government became sporadic while the government feared that the King was acting beyond his constitutional powers. Like his father, Leopold was subject to Article 64 of the constitution which specified that no act of the King was valid unless counter-signed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> minister, yet also given supreme power in military matters under Article 68. The two clauses appeared to contradict each other and gave all the king's acts in military-political matters an unclear constitutional footing.|$|E
5|$|He {{was arrested}} on 10 October 1990 on charges {{relating}} to kidnapping and extortion. The charges alleged an extortion scheme that involved tying a supposed bomb to a British businessman's leg. The Bhutto family considered the indictment politically motivated and fabricated. In the October 1990 elections, {{he was elected to}} the National Assembly while in jail. Bhutto and the PPP staged a walkout from the inaugural session of the National Assembly to protest Zardari's incarceration. He posted $20,000 bail, but his release was blocked <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> ordinance that removed a court's power to release suspects being tried in the terrorist court, which fast-track trials for alleged terrorists. The ordinance was later revoked and a special court acquitted him of bank fraud and conspiracy to murder political opponents. He was freed in February 1993. In March 1994, Zardari was acquitted of bank fraud charges. All other corruption charges relating to Bhutto's first term were dropped or thrown out of the courts.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, {{during the}} {{presidency}} of Julio Argentino Roca, Belgrano's body was exhumed from the atrium of Santo Domingo, to be moved into a mausoleum. This was done on 4 September, <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> commission which included Dr. Joaquín V. González (ministry of interior), Pablo Riccheri (ministry of war), Gabriel L. Souto (president of the commission), Fray Modesto Becco (from the convent), Carlos Vega Belgrano and coronel Manuel Belgrano (descendants of Belgrano), Dr. Armando Claros (subsecretary of the Interior), Dr. Marcial Quiroga (Health Inspector of the Army), Dr. Carlos Malbrán (president of the National Department of Health), Coronel Justo Domínguez, and doctors Luis Peluffo and C. Massot (Arsenal of War). The exhumation revealed a number of preserved bones, pieces of wood, and nails. The bones were placed on a silver plate, and the following day {{there was a great}} controversy in the press: the newspaper La Prensa announced that Joaquín V. González and Riccheri had stolen a pair of teeth. Both were returned the following day. Gonzalez declared that he intended to show the tooth to his friends, and Riccheri that he took one to Belgrano's biographer, Bartolomé Mitre.|$|E

5|$|Lethal {{injection}} is {{the practice}} of injecting one or more drugs into a person <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> {{for the express purpose}} of causing immediate death. While Nazi Germany was known to execute enemies of the state using an injection of lethal drugs, the first country to legalize and formally implement what is referred to today as lethal injection was the United States. The state of Texas adopted it as its form on capital punishment in 1977 and executed the first person by it, Charles Brooks Jr., in 1982. The practice was subsequently adopted by the other U.S. states using capital punishment. As of 2017, the method is being used by 31 U.S. states, as well as by their federal government and military.|$|E
5|$|On New Years Day 1991, St George's became grant-maintained; {{later that}} year, it {{announced}} plans to convert to a comprehensive school; the status was granted the following February. In 1992, it was awarded Technology School status, which was accompanied <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Government</b> grant of £500,000 and a gift of £250,000 made by Reg Brealey; these contributed {{to the construction of}} a Science and Technology building, which opened in 1994. Sponsored by Brealey, St George's {{was one of the first}} schools designated a Technology College (a specialist school) in England in February 1994, a status renewed in 1997. More extensions followed: an English building in 1994, a library with art and physics classrooms in 1997, a sports hall in 2001, and a science building in 2005. In 2000, the Technology College status was renewed for the second time and the school received the Schools Curriculum and Sportsmark awards and was recognised as the 10th most improved specialist school in the country. After the abolition of grant-maintained status in 1998, St George's converted to a Foundation School.|$|E
5|$|The {{historic}} Ellis Cottage and Rumps Bakery buildings lie {{near the}} corner of Perseverance and North East roads. Built in 1854, Ellis Cottage is a single room stone building built by John Stevens, founder of Steventon Estate that later become the suburb of Tea Tree Gully. It was named after the Ellis family, who owned and used the building for storage for many years until World War II. Rumps Bakery was built in 1854 with local stone. From 1867 to 1893 it was rented to Charles Rumps, who started Tea Tree Gully's first bakery in the building in 1872. In 1894, the building was sold to Ernest Heitmann, who continued {{to use it as}} a bakery. Until the mid-20th century, the Ellis family and an adjacent general store frequently used it for storage. Assisted <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> grant and supervised by the Department of Environment and Heritage, the Friends of Anstey Hill stabilised both buildings in 2000.|$|E
