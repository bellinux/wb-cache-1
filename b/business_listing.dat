40|$|Background: In {{order to}} conduct a {{probability}} business survey, a high quality sampling frame of enterprises is needed. Objectives: The goal of the paper is to investigate publicly available online <b>businesses</b> <b>lists</b> {{which can be used}} as sampling frames in business surveys in Croatia and to find out whether they have a satisfactory quality level. Methods/Approach: Publicly available <b>businesses</b> <b>lists</b> in Croatia are examined and their appropriateness for use in different modes of data collection as business sampling frames is inspected. The advantages and disadvantages of <b>businesses</b> <b>lists</b> are discussed and compared. Results: Overall 11 online <b>businesses</b> <b>lists</b> are considered as business sampling frames in the paper. The comparison analysis has shown that <b>businesses</b> <b>lists</b> from the government institutions are the best choice when business surveys are conducted face-to-face, by mail and/or by telephone. However, none of the observed <b>businesses</b> <b>lists</b> is good enough to be used in a business web survey. Conclusions: The research has shown that the publicly available online <b>businesses</b> <b>lists</b> are of a satisfactory level of quality only if traditional data collection modes are used. Unfortunately, they are not appropriate in business web surveys. Therefore, the development of a business register in Croatia is a prerequisite for conducting probability and representative business web surveys in the future...|$|R
40|$|In food-environment research, an {{alternative}} to resource-intensive direct observation on the ground has been the use of commercial <b>business</b> <b>lists.</b> We sought to determine how well a frequently used commercial <b>business</b> <b>list</b> measures a dense urban food environment like the Bronx, NY. On 155 Bronx street segments, investigators compared two different levels for matches between the <b>business</b> <b>list</b> and direct ground observation: lenient (by business type) and strict (by business name). For each level of matching, researchers calculated sensitivities and positive predictive values (PPVs) for the <b>business</b> <b>list</b> overall and by broad business categories: General Grocers (eg, supermarkets), Specialty Food Stores (eg, produce markets), Restaurants, and Businesses Not Primarily Selling Food (eg, newsstands). Even after cleaning the <b>business</b> <b>list</b> (eg, for cases of multiple listings at a single location), and allowing for inexactness in listed street addresses and spellings of business names, the overall performance of the <b>business</b> <b>list</b> was poor. For strict matches, the <b>business</b> <b>list</b> had an overall sensitivity of 39. 3 % and PPV of 45. 5 %. Sensitivities and PPVs by broad business categories were not meaningfully different from overall values, although sensitivity for General Grocers and PPV for Specialty Food Stores were particularly low: 26. 2 % and 32 %, respectively. For lenient matches, sensitivities and PPVs were somewhat higher but still poor: 52. 4 % to 60 % and 60 % to 75 %, respectively. The <b>business</b> <b>list</b> is inadequate to measure the actual food environment in the Bronx. If results represent performance in other settings, findings from prior studies linking food environments to diet and diet-related health outcomes using such <b>business</b> <b>lists</b> are in question, and future studies of this type should avoid relying solely on such <b>business</b> <b>lists.</b> 1 K 23 AG 036934 /AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States 5 U 48 DP 001935 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United StatesK 23 AG 036934 /AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesKL 2 RR 025749 /RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesKL 2 RR 025749 /RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesL 60 MD 003139 /MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United StatesTL 1 RR 025748 /RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesTL 1 RR 025748 /RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesUL 1 RR 025750 /RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesUL 1 RR 025750 /RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States 2014 - 10 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 23871107 PMC 378358...|$|R
