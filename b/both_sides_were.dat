5|$|Song sources likely {{inflated}} {{the number}} of Jin soldiers and casualties at Caishi, but the 18,000 figure for the Song army is plausible. Modern {{studies suggest that the}} battle was smaller and that <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> more evenly matched than traditional accounts suggest. Nonetheless, the victory boosted the morale of the Song infantry and halted the southern advance of the Jin army.|$|E
5|$|The Ibratnama {{estimates}} that 12,000 horsemen of Azam Shah lay {{dead on the}} battlefield. It further {{estimates that}} at least 10,000 infantry soldiers from <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> dead. Khan Zaman and Khan Alam Dakhini's bodies were sent to Gwalior for burial. Ram Singh Hada and Rao Dalpat Bundela's bodies were sent to Nurabad for cremation. Azam Shah and his three dead sons were buried at Humayun's Tomb in Delhi.|$|E
5|$|The Persian fleet {{was still}} {{large enough to}} both bottle up the Allied navy in the straits of Salamis, and send ships to land troops in the Peloponnese. However, in the final reckoning, <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> {{prepared}} to stake everything on a naval battle, {{in the hope of}} decisively altering the course of the war.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy {{up to this point}} in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of the proximity of the enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} geography, the Royal Navy {{could keep the}} German High Seas Fleet {{confined}} to the North Sea with relative ease, {{but was unable to}} break the German superiority in the Baltic Sea. <b>Both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> aware, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, that a full fleet engagement would likely result in a British victory. The German strategy was, therefore, to try to provoke an engagement on favourable terms: either inducing a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coast, where friendly minefields, torpedo boats, and submarines could even the odds.|$|E
5|$|For {{ten minutes}} after the {{explosion}} there was no firing; sailors from <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> either too shocked by the blast or desperately extinguishing fires aboard their own ships to continue the fight. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of Orient. At 22:10, Franklin restarted the engagement by firing on Swiftsure. Isolated and battered, Blanquet's ship was soon dismasted and the admiral, suffering a severe head wound, was forced to surrender by the combined firepower of Swiftsure and Defence. More than half of Franklins crew had been killed or wounded.|$|E

5|$|Gruban {{successfully}} appealed {{against his}} internment, {{and as soon}} as he was freed brought Booth to court. The case was so popular that the involved barristers found it physically difficult to get into the court each day due to the size of the crowds gathered outside. Although the barristers on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> noted for their skill the case went almost entirely one way, with the jury taking only ten minutes to find Booth guilty. This was one of the first noted cases of Patrick Hastings, and his victory in it led to him applying to become a King's Counsel.|$|E
5|$|Nationalist {{movements}} {{in some countries}} and regions, notably Guatemala, Indonesia and Indochina were often allied with communist groups, or perceived in the West to be allied with communists. In this context, the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s; additionally, the Soviets saw continuing losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology. <b>Both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> selling armaments to gain influence.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{between the}} owners, led by {{commissioner}} David Stern, and the players, led by director Billy Hunter and president Derek Fisher {{of the labor}} union National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), began in early 2011 and continued through November. The main issues dividing <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> the division of revenue {{and the structure of}} the salary cap and luxury tax. Owners proposed to reduce the players' share of basketball related income (BRI) from 57% to 47%, but the players countered with 53% of BRI. Owners wanted to implement a hard salary cap and a harsher luxury tax, hoping to increase competition among teams, whereas players wanted to keep the current soft salary cap structure intact.|$|E

5|$|On 30 March, the Kurdish irregulars confronted Aqil's irregulars and Bedouin allies at the Horns of Hattin, {{near the}} village of Hattin. For the most part, <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> armed with swords and spears and to a lesser extent, rifles, rather than the modern {{weaponry}} at the Ottoman military's disposal. Initially, the battle was going in Shamdin's favor and a portion of Aqil's troops began to flee. However, Salih Agha, Aqil's brother, led his group in a surprise attack against the Kurds. As a result, Shamdin's forces were dealt a decisive blow and commander Hasan Agha was among the 150 fatalities of that battle.|$|E
5|$|Once he {{saw that}} the Umayyads' left wing was holding steady, Ibn al-Ashtar changed tack and ordered his troops to attack the Umayyads' center, believing if he could {{disperse}} the core of the Umayyad army, the latter's right and left wings would likewise disperse. Ibn al-Ashtar himself took part in this assault and is said to have slew several Umayyad soldiers with his coterie of close companions. Amid the heavy clashes, numerous men on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> killed and the Umayyads were routed, Upon witnessing this, Umayr ibn al-Hubab communicated to Ibn al-Ashtar if he should defect to his camp; Ibn al-Ashtar told him to hold off because he feared his men would harm Umayr amid their anger.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians {{believed}} their ships {{to have less}} effective guns than their enemy, so decided to engage the Italians at close range and ram them. The Austrian fleet formed into an arrowhead formation with the ironclads in the first line, charging at the Italian ironclad squadron. In the melée which followed <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> frustrated {{by the lack of}} damage inflicted by guns, and by the difficulty of ramming—nonetheless, the effective ramming attack being made by the Austrian flagship against the Italian attracted great attention in following years.|$|E

5|$|The {{engagement}} was confusing {{for both}} sides, {{and the view}} was soon obscured by gunpowder smoke. Many ships on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> badly damaged, and around 2,000 men killed or wounded. Towards the end, a squadron of Danish ships met up with Dutch and escorted them into the harbor of Copenhagen. The Swedish fleet had failed; much-needed reinforcements and supplies had reached the beleaguered Danish town. The combined Danish and Dutch fleet now had control of the seas, forcing the Swedish fleet to seek refuge in the harbor of Landskrona on the Swedish mainland.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began on}} 21 January 1997, under the {{supervision}} of a three-judge panel led by Mikaela Warsito. After <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> unable to come to an amicable settlement, a several-month-long trial began, in which Udin's family, Bernas reporters, and the police testified. On 7 April 1997, Wuryanto was convicted of destroying evidence for taking the blood, which Marisyem's lawyers speculated was used to frame Sumaji. Only {{a small percentage of the}} damages were awarded, after the court ruled that testimony from Udin's family– whom they saw as having a conflict of interest in the outcome of the case– was ineligible.|$|E
5|$|While Arbour {{was pleased}} with her profile, MacKenzie was not. Reviewers noted Off's {{critical}} portrayal of MacKenzie as being excessive and MacKenzie considered suing Off for libel. Instead MacKenzie wrote a response in The Globe and Mail presenting {{his point of view}} concerning the mission and events. In 2008 he wrote an autobiography with a chapter dedicated to addressing the criticism he received as a result of Off's book. While Off condemns MacKenzie for not learning the conflict's history and telling American audiences that <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> to blame for the conflict, MacKenzie defends himself by stating it was international decision-making, not his opinions, that led the UN to not intervene.|$|E

5|$|While Britain {{may have}} been militarily secure in 1940, <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> aware of the {{possibility}} of a political collapse.

5|$|Also on {{show is a}} late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at {{weddings and}} festivals. It is made of {{embroidered}} handwoven black silk with a separate heavy red silk fringe. A woman wore the shambar mainly on her wedding day, positioned so that when she covered her face the embroidered end would show. Another item in the collection is a headdress (iraqiyeh) embroidered with cross-stitch and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down as family heirlooms. Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> wrapped around the woman's braids to facilitate the bundling of her hair, then secured {{to the back of}} the headdress.|$|E
5|$|In December 1789, {{after five}} years of {{diplomatic}} wrangling about the terms of the Treaty of Mangalore that had ended the Second Anglo-Mysore War, the ruler of Mysore Tipu Sultan again declared war on the British East India Company and their allies in Southern India. For the next two years the war continued as British forces and their allies drove the Mysore armies back towards the capital of Seringapatam. <b>Both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> reliant on supply by sea to maintain their campaigns inland: the British forces were supported from their major ports at Bombay and Madras, later stationing additional forces at the small port of Tellicherry inside Mysore territory. The Mysorean forces were supplied through Mangalore by French ships. France had been an ally of the Tipu Sultan's father Hyder Ali during the Second Anglo-Mysore War and although the political instability caused by the French Revolution in Europe prevented active involvement, they ensured that their ships kept up a supply of equipment to Mysore throughout the war.|$|E
