50|$|Tannins are {{phenolic}} compounds that are {{commonly found in}} plants. Found in the leaf, bud, seed, root, and stem tissues, tannins are widely distributed in many different species of plants.

Tannins can be <b>beneficial,</b> <b>having</b> been shown to increase milk production, wool growth, ovulation rate, and lambing percentage, as well as reducing bloat risk and reducing internal parasite burdens.|$|E

40|$|The {{rise and}} decline of {{development}} economics Development economics arose as a subdiscipline of economics {{in the first}} postwar decade. Its principal assertion was that conventional economic analysis and policy is not applicable to the less developed countries. This claim was bolstered by the recent triumph of Keynesianism. The distinguishing earmark of underdevelopment {{was believed to be}} underemployment. However, with some exceptions, development economics did accept the classical claim that economic relations between advanced and less developed countries would always be <b>beneficial.</b> <b>Having</b> thus positioned itself halfway between neo-classical economics and neo-Marxist analysis, development economics and the industrialization it had advocated were eventually attacked from both ends of the ideological spectrum. Its decline, however, is due less to this convergence among its heterogeneous critics than to the frequently disastrous political concomitants of economic development in recent decades.
