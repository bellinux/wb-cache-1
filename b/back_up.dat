50|$|Another Add-On is Advanced Tape Support, for <b>backing</b> <b>up</b> to {{multiple}} single tape drives simultaneously or to a dual-tape autoloader.

5|$|As a British {{withdrawal}} from France {{at the earliest}} opportunity had been the original intent, the brigade boarded ships bound for Italy eleven days after landing.

5|$|After 1970, as Fort Lauderdale became {{essentially}} built out, {{growth in}} the area shifted to suburbs to the west. As cities such as Coral Springs, Miramar, and Pembroke Pines experienced explosive growth, Fort Lauderdale's population stagnated, and the city actually shrank by almost 4,000 people between 1980, when the city had 153,279 people, and 1990, when the population was 149,377. A slight rebound brought the population <b>back</b> <b>up</b> to 152,397 at the 2000 census. Since 2000, Fort Lauderdale has gained slightly over 18,000 residents through annexation of seven neighborhoods in unincorporated Broward County.|$|E
5|$|After {{the train}} departs from the station, it {{immediately}} begins {{to climb the}} vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching {{the top of the}} lift, the train turns 45 degrees backwards putting the train and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as the train exits the lift, it goes through a heartline roll before going down the only drop in the layout of the roller coaster. The train speeds through the station going <b>back</b> <b>up</b> the lift. Once it loses momentum the train then returns down passing through the station again. It then proceeds <b>back</b> <b>up</b> the drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground. After passing the station for the third time, the train is stopped {{near the top of the}} lift hill. It is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board the train. The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a second cycle at the operator's discretion. When the train stops on the lift hill at the end of the ride, instead of lowering slowly back to the station, the chain will raise the car up and send it through the ride again.|$|E

50|$|As {{well as the}} {{requirements}} above, the right fielder <b>backs</b> <b>up</b> first base on all throws from the catcher and pitcher, when possible, and all bunted balls, since the catcher or the first baseman must be available for fielding the ball. The right fielder <b>backs</b> <b>up</b> second base on any ball thrown {{from the left side}} of the field, i.e. shortstop, third base, or foul line territory. The right fielder <b>backs</b> <b>up</b> first base when the first baseman is in a run down between 3rd base and home.|$|R
50|$|The {{costs of}} disk storage have {{decreased}} faster {{than that of}} tapes. Until {{about the end of}} the twentieth century, prices and capacities allowed <b>backing</b> <b>up</b> a desktop hard drive to tape more cheaply and more compactly than <b>backing</b> <b>up</b> to an additional external or removable drive. Drive prices offer capacities of hundreds to thousands of megabytes on relatively inexpensive machines. <b>Backing</b> <b>up</b> to an external USB drive became cheaper, and the drive more compact, than tape for a non-networked machine used by a business or serious user.|$|R
5|$|As a {{case study}} of disinformation, the authors {{describe}} journalist , whose publication in France was secretly financed by Soviet intelligence. Its contents were biased against the Western world in favor of the Soviet agenda, and had considerable impact on public opinion. In another example, the authors bring forth an analysis of the World Peace Council, which operated as a front organization for Soviet intelligence. They discuss its operations negatively impacting both NATO and the U.S. Shultz and Godson <b>back</b> <b>up</b> their analyses with interviews from two Soviet officials who had defected from their posts in Soviet intelligence, and spoke of disinformation campaigns against Western interests.|$|E
5|$|As {{he began}} the third orbit, Schirra {{disconnected}} the spacecraft's gyroscopes, turned off part of the electrical power system, and let the capsule drift. He took advantage of this quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by weightlessness, and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft <b>back</b> <b>up</b> over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as he crossed over towards California shut down the electrical power for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the onboard camera.|$|E

Unpersuaded, Captain Marvel returns to the Triskelion, headquarters of the Ultimates, to continue her investigation of a suspected Hydra agent. There, Captain Marvel, the Ultimates, Alpha Flight, and Storm's X-Men are confronted by Iron Man, the Avengers, and Magneto's X-Men.
