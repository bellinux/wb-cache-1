40|$|Male {{fruit fly}} attractants, cue-lure and methyl eugenol (ME), have been {{successfully}} used for the last 50 years in the monitoring and control of Dacini fruit flies (Bactrocera and Dacus species). However, over 50 % of Dacini are non-responsive to either lure, including some pest species. A new lure, zingerone, {{has been found to}} weakly attract cue- and ME-responsive species in Malaysia. In Australia it attracted a weakly cue-responsive minor pest Bactrocera jarvisi (Tryon) and three non-responsive' species. Similar compounds were tested in Queensland and attracted cue- and ME-responsive species and two non-responsive' species. In this study, 14 novel compounds, including raspberry ketone formate (RKF) (Melolure) and zingerone, were field tested in comparison with cue-lure and ME at 17 sites in north Queensland. The most attractive novel lures were isoeugenol, methyl-isoeugenol, dihydroeugenol and zingerone. Several non-responsive' species responded to the new lures: Bactrocera halfordiae (Tryon), a species of some market access concern, was most attracted to isoeugenol; B. barringtoniae (Tryon), B. bidentata (May) and B. murrayi (Perkins) responded to isoeugenol, methyl-isoeugenol and dihydroeugenol; two new species of Dacus responded to zingerone. Bactrocera kraussi (Hardy), a cue-responsive minor pest in north Queensland, was significantly more attracted to isoeugenol than cue-lure. The cue-responsive D. absonifacies (May) and D. secamoneaeDrew were significantly more attracted to zingerone than cue-lure. Bactrocera yorkensisDrew & Hancock, a ME-responsive species was significantly more attracted to isoeugenol, methyl-isoeugenol and dihydroeugenol than ME. The preferential response to RKF or cue-lure was species specific. Six species were significantly more attracted to RKF, including the <b>pests</b> <b>B.</b> tryoni (Froggatt), B. frauenfeldi (Schiner) and minor <b>pest</b> <b>B.</b> bryoniae (Tryon); eight species were significantly more attracted to cue-lure including the <b>pest</b> <b>B.</b> neohumeralis (Hardy).

40|$|Agriculture {{requires}} inputs, {{which can}} be found within the system or need to be supplied from outside. The latter, referred to as the ‘Green Revolution’ in the 1950 s and developed as the high external input agriculture, has spread over the world as a solution to the food crisis that arose due to World War II. The drive embraced a special package including high- yielding crop varieties, inorganic fertilizer, agro- chemicals and farm machineries. As a result, farmers in many developing countries began to practice mono-cropping with high external inputs. This has turned traditional ecological agriculture into environmentally destructive food production systems, which provided huge amounts of produce causing serious environmental damage. During the ‘Green Revolution’ traditional crop varieties were replaced by high-yielding new improved varieties, which had higher yield potential. However, natural pest resistance of these high-yielding varieties was generally poor, while nutritive requirements were high. Increased use of pesticides and chemical fertilizer is a matter of concern. Some of the issues and problems due to indiscriminate use of pesticides are: a) <b>pest</b> resistance; <b>b)</b> <b>pest</b> resurgence; c) health hazards; d) environmental pollution; and e) lower profits to farmers. Extensive use of chemical fertilizer has created environment issues such as nitrate leaching, release of greenhouse gases and eutrophication of inland water bodies. Millennium development goals earmark the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, while ensuring environmental sustainability. This dispels the concept of achieving food security in any country through the adoption of high external input agriculture. Sri Lanka remains vulnerable to natural disasters such as floods, droughts, cyclones, landslides, epidemics etc., causing substantial threats to the food security situation of the country. Challenges posed by external factors due to globalization and open- economic policies have directed the country’s agriculture to move away from self- reliance. This situation demands a firm and perfect policy for the country’s agriculture. Furthermore, present agriculture does not show any indication of sustainability as it has ignored the centuries-old wisdom of traditional agriculture. Farmers’ dependency mentality evolved due to modern agriculture and government policies, which dealt with agriculture from time to time. This should be gradually replaced by developing farmers’ self- confidence, selfmotivation and empowerment. There is a great potential to increase productivity in Sri Lanka as only 40 % of the average potential for grain yield was achieved in different ecological and hydrological regimes. By narrowing this gap between actual and potential yield, Sri Lanka will not only increase productivity but also increase the competitive advantage for rice with other countries in the region. The experiences of the present productivity improvement program of the Department of Agriculture (DOA) have clearly shown that the average yield could be increased. In achieving food security in the country, a major set back in the development process is that institutional linkage among agencies responsible for water, land, agriculture and environment is very weak, and they work in isolation, setting their own targets. The need is felt for the immediate formulation of a firm policy to implement a sustainable agricultural production program in the country in order to ensure the food security in Sri Lanka.

50|$|Unlike {{several of}} the other most {{important}} fruit fly <b>pests,</b> <b>B.</b> tryoni does not breed continuously but passes the winter in the adult stage. The total life cycle requires {{two to three weeks}} in summer and up to two months in autumn. Adult females live many months, and four or five overlapping generations may develop annually. Adult females, after passing through a two-week pre-oviposition stage following emergence from the pupae, deposit eggs in groups, up to seven eggs per group, in fruit punctures. Females often oviposit in punctures made by other fruit flies such as those of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), with the result that many eggs often occur in a single cavity. As many as 40 larvae have been found in one peach, and as many as 67 adults have been reared from one apple. Eggs hatch in two to three days under favorable weather conditions. The ensuing larval development may be completed in as little as five days. Pupation normally occurs in the soil. Pupal development requires from a week in summer to a month or more in cooler weather. Adults may live a year or more. Adults feed primarily upon juices of host plants, nectar, and honeydew secreted by various kinds of insects.|$|R

Strong fluctuations in Mn 2 + ion levels detected by EPR spectroscopy versus time were detected in leaves infested by aphids, which may indicate the involvement of these ions in the control of O 2 •− production. An enhanced superoxide dismutase activity is an important element in leaf defense against oxidative stress. Visible symptoms were found in aphid-infested A. officinalis.

The main threat for the long term use of <b>B.</b> thuringiensis in <b>pest</b> control is the ability of insects to develop resistance. Thus, the identification of insect genes involved in conferring resistance is of paramount importance. A colony of Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was selected for 15 years in the laboratory for resistance to Xentari (TM), a B. thuringiensis-based insecticide, reaching a final resistance level of greater than 1, 000 -fold. Around 600 midgut ESTs were analyzed by DNA-macroarray in order to find differences in midgut gene expression between susceptible and resistant insects. Among the differentially expressed genes, repat and arylphorin were identified and their increased expression was correlated with B. thuringiensis resistance. We also found overlap among genes that were constitutively over-expressed in resistant insects with genes that were up-regulated in susceptible insects after exposure to Xentari (TM), suggesting a permanent activation of the response to Xentari (TM) in resistant insects. Increased aminopeptidase activity in the lumen of resistant insects in the absence of exposure to Xentari (TM) corroborated the hypothesis of permanent activation of response genes. Increase in midgut proliferation has been proposed as a mechanism of response to pathogens in the adult from several insect species. Analysis of S. exigua larvae revealed that midgut proliferation was neither increased in resistant insects nor induced by exposure of susceptible larvae to Xentari (TM), suggesting that mechanisms other than midgut proliferation are involved in the response to B. thuringiensis by S. exigua larvae...|$|R

40|$|A fact of {{life for}} farmers, hunter-gatherers, and {{fishermen}} in the rural {{parts of the world}} are that crops fail, wild resources become scarce, and winds discourage fishing. In this article we approach subsistence risk from the perspective of coexistence thinking, the simultaneous application of natural and supernatural causal models to explain subsistence success and failure. In southwestern Madagascar, the ecological world is characterized by extreme variability and unpredictability, and the cosmological world is characterized by anxiety about supernatural dangers. Ecological and cosmological causes seem to point to different risk minimizing strategies: to avoid losses from drought, flood, or heavy winds, one should diversify activities and be flexible; but to avoid losses caused by disrespected spirits one should narrow one's range of behaviors to follow the code of taboos and offerings. We address this paradox by investigating whether southwestern Malagasy understand natural and supernatural causes as occupying separate, contradictory explanatory systems (target dependence), whether they make no categorical distinction between natural and supernatural forces and combine them within a single explanatory system (synthetic thinking), or whether they have separate natural and supernatural categories of causes that are integrated into one explanatory system so that supernatural forces drive natural forces (integrative thinking). Results from three field studies suggest that (a) informants explain why crops, prey, and market activities succeed or fail with reference to natural causal forces like rainfall and <b>pests,</b> (<b>b)</b> they explain why individual persons experience success or failure primarily with supernatural factors like God and ancestors, and (c) they understand supernatural forces as driving natural forces, so that ecology and cosmology represent distinct sets of causes within a single explanatory framework.

The species has even been recently discovered in caves. This invasive crayfish is a polytrophic keystone species that can exert multiple pressures on ecosystems. Most studies deal with the decline of macrophytes and predation on several species (amphibians, molluscs, and macroinvertebrates), highlighting how this biodiversity loss leads to unbalanced food chains. At a management level, the species is considered as (a) a devastating digger of the water drainage systems in southern and central Europe, (<b>b)</b> an agricultural <b>pest</b> in Mediterranean territories, consuming, for example, young rice plants, and (c) a threat to the restoration of water bodies in north-western Europe.

This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the full[2] pest risk assessment conducted by France on Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) with French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion considered as endangered area. Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) is a well-characterised virus of the family Nanoviridae, which infects banana and plantain. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [3]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 <b>b).</b> Although the <b>pest</b> risk assessment could be improved, and additional information provided to substantiate the statements made and ratings given in the assessment, the Panel agrees with the conclusion of the French document that the phytosanitary risk associated with BBTV is extremely high. BBTV is a highly pathogenic agent for banana, and thus the Panel concludes that the negative economic consequences of its introduction are very high, both for commercial plantations of dessert bananas in Guadeloupe and Martinique and production of plantain and cooking banana in small holdings and private gardens throughout the PRA area[4]. The Panel concludes that BBTV has a high probability of entry and a high probability of establishment in the French overseas departments, and that the international movement of large quantities of vitroplants represents the most important entry pathway. The Panel further considers that virus indexing of mother plants used for vitroplant production, provides an effective means to prevent entry of BBTV.

This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the full[1] the pest risk assessment conducted by France on Panonychus citri with French Guiana and Martinique considered as endangered areas. The citrus red mite Panonychus citri (McGregor) is a species distributed in all regions of the world. It primarily feeds on the upper surface of mature leaves, fruit and young branches, and may cause heavy leaf drop, twig dieback and fruit drop. P. citri has a wide host range including all species of citrus, apple, pear, peach, plum, carambola, papaya, loquat and grapevines. Citrus is the major host, and although P. citri is polyphagous, the above effects have only been recorded on the major host (CABI, 2007). P. citri has a short generation time: up to 16 generations may occur within one year, with the majority of these (10 - 11) in spring/summer (Jeppson et al., 1975). It relies on wind for long-distance dispersal (Jeppson et al., 1975). Natural enemies are important for the biocontrol of P. citri wherever it occurs. Existing control programs (IPM, application of petroleum spray oil) may control P. citri but effective biocontrol strategies exist (New South Wales, Australia, Smith et al., 1997). The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [2]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 <b>b).</b> The <b>pest</b> risk assessment concludes that the risk of introduction into French Guiana and Martinique is moderate for the citrus fruits pathway, high for the citrus plants for planting (whole plants and budwood for grafting). The risk of establishment is very high, and the potential economic impact is moderate. The Panel judges that the probability of the pest to enter the PRA area[3] is higher than moderate because:* Normal pre-packing procedures should eliminate the pest from the fruit but not all imported citrus fruit undergoes this treatment,* The pest may occur in the calyx and not be detected during inspection,* The current restrictions limit the probability of entry through the citrus plant pathway (including propagation material), but* Other host plants, including ornamentals, can carry the pest, and* The passenger pathway, although unknown, can seriously increase the probability of entryFurther, the Panel agrees that P. citri has a high probability of establishment, due to its polyphagous nature, the presence of suitable environmental conditions, widely dispersed host plants in the PRA area, and the high dispersal ability of the pest. Once established, the pest can spread rapidly. The Panel disagrees with the rating of economic consequences in the pest risk assessment. There is only limited evidence of the harmfulness of P. citri to citrus crops in its area of current distribution and no evidence of harm to other host plants. Further, effective management methods exist to control the pest (pesticides and biological control methods). Additionally, citrus fruits are not grown extensively for commercial purposes in the PRA area, therefore the economic consequences of the presence of the pest, as also pointed out in the pest risk assessment, are not expected to be serious. Uncertainty exists about the absence of the pest from the PRA area, quality and reliability of treatment of fruit transported from areas where the pest is present, and the efficacy of existing biological control agents in the PRA area. These, however, are not expected to influence the overall conclusion. The Panel disagrees with the conclusion of the French document, and does not consider P. citri as appropriate for pest risk management. Therefore, the Panel concludes that P. citri is not potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms of Directive 2000 / 29 E...|$|R

In particular, the Panel was asked whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful organisms for the endangered area of the above departments, in the meaning of the definition mentioned in Article 2. 1. (e) of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the simplified[2] pest risk assessment conducted by France on Nacoleia octasema with French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion considered as endangered area. Nacoleia octasema Meyrick, the banana scab moth, (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is primarily a pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). In addition, it has been reported to attack, as minor hosts, Heliconia spp., Nypa fruticans (the Nypa palm), Pandanus spp. and maize. The larvae feed on the skin of the banana fruit creating black scars that may greatly reduce their market value. In some parts of its range, primarily the East Indies, it does not feed on bananas. Since no intraspecific taxonomic characteristics have been identified, it is suggested that this is due to races with different host ranges. Serious economic damage has been recorded in Queensland and Fiji. Its distribution is restricted to Australasia, south-east Asia and the Pacific islands. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [3]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 <b>b).</b> The <b>pest</b> risk assessment is short and based very strongly on the CABI Crop Protection Compendium datasheet (2001) but it does provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusions reached. The Panel agrees with the pest risk assessment which states that entry is very unlikely since the pupa is the only stage that could be transported. Any pupae in the fruit bunches are likely to be washed off and plant debris from the base of infested banana trees is very unlikely to occur with young plants. Even if the current ban on banana imports is lifted, the pest will have a very low probability of surviving the specific conditions of transport and trade with countries where the pest occurs. Imports are very unlikely since these countries are so far from the French overseas departments and home-produced fruit is readily available. Passengers are also very unlikely to carry banana fruit that might contain N. octasema the long distances from countries where the pest occurs into the French overseas departments. The Panel agrees that the potential for establishment is very high due to the similarities in climate between the pest’s current area of distribution and the French overseas departments and the abundance of suitable hosts in the PRA area[4]. The Panel agrees with the high risk rating of impacts for Guadeloupe and Martinique because of the potential loss of export markets. However, the impacts in French Guiana and Réunion, that do not have export markets, are likely to be minor. In summary, therefore, N. octasema poses a risk of high impact to Guadeloupe and Martinique and low impact to French Guiana and Réunion but the probability of the impacts occurring is very low. It is very difficult to come to a firm conclusion in situations of very low probability and high impact but the Panel agreed that, on balance, an analysis of risk management options would be appropriate because it could be used to determine whether the very unlikely risk of entry could be reduced to negligible with simple measures. The Panel therefore concludes that N. octasema does have the characteristics of a quarantine pest[5] for Guadeloupe and Martinique and that the analysis of risk management options is appropriate for these two French overseas departments. Using the terminology in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC, this means that the Panel concludes that this species is a harmful organism for Guadeloupe and Martinique and is therefore potentially eligible for listing in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC...|$|R

This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the simplified[2] pest risk assessment conducted by France on Odoiporus longicollis with French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion considered as endangered area. Odoiporus longicollis, the banana stem weevil, occurs in India, China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand where it is a key pest of bananas and plantains. The adult weevils are nocturnal, black-coloured, relatively large (23 - 39 mm), strong-flying beetles. All life stages are present throughout the year in the infested plant. Damage is caused by the larva tunneling inside the pseudostem of the banana plant, weakening the plant that is unable to bear the weight of the fruit. Up to 90 % yield loss can result. Control is by cultural methods and injecting pesticides into the stem. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [3]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 <b>b).</b> Although the <b>pest</b> risk assessment could be improved in the analysis of entry pathways and the analysis of economic, social and environmental consequences in case of establishment, the Panel agrees with the conclusion of the French document that :*the probability of entry of O. longicollis into the PRA area[4] is moderate. *O. longicollis has a very high probability of establishment and spread, due to the widespread distribution of its host plants, banana and plantain in the PRA area and*the impact of pest infestation on the host plant is high. Additionally, Musa spp. fruits are widely grown in the PRA area and are of particular economic importance as an export crop for Guadeloupe and Martinique. If the species became established in these two islands, export markets for banana could be seriously affected and additional control costs may reduce competitiveness. Smallholdings producing fruit for the local market or for home-consumption could suffer yield losses impacting on production and consumption patterns, with related negative social impacts, should the yield of plantain be substantially reduced. Similar effects are possible for French Guiana, where banana is also grown in shifting cultivation. Uncertainties exist concerning the importance of different possible entry pathways, some biological features of the pest, and the potential for social and environmental consequences, but these are not expected to affect the conclusions reached by the Panel. The Panel concludes that O. longicollis is appropriate for evaluation of pest risk management options for the endangered areas of French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC...|$|R
40|$|Entomology, {{like many}} other {{biological}} disciplines has developed into a quantitative science in nearly {{all aspects of the}} subject. Insect ecology is no exception, and in fact, has probably received more attention recently with the rapid development of insect population dynamics, the emergence of synecological studies, and the challenge such studies offer to statisticians and mathematicians. There is also a growing awareness of the significance and limitations of the environment in which insects play an important role. Searching questions are now being asked concerning the effect of insects and their control on man's existence (see Report of Environmental Pollution by the U. S. A. President's Science Advisory Committee 1965). The only universally meaningful way to attempt to answer these questions and to co-ordinate the work involved is, firstly, to quantify or measure the environmental parameters involved and, secondly, by their rational manipulation towards intelligent goals. The former is aptly described by Chant (1964) in relation to insect control, and the latter by Geier (1966). With the current specific emphasis on costs of food production in New Zealand, insect ecological studies with an economic basis should be directed towards the provision of urgently required knowledge to help answer the following questions. 1. How much harm or benefit is brought about by both the direct and indirect actions of insects? 2. What are the various courses of action available to minimise the benefit of insects? 3. What are the costs involved in pursuing these aims? The theme of this thesis is based on this ecological economic cost benefit philosophy. Not only have various quantitative entomological tools been used, but economic principles have been included in a conceptual framework to study the ecology and economic status of the Wiseana cervinata (Walk.) complex in New Zealand. This pest and Costelytra zealandica (Wh.) are considered the two most important insect pests in New Zealand. As pastoral farming has been, and will remain, the basis of this country's economic structure for some time, damage caused by these pests is of national and farm significance. This conclusion, together with recent political stimulus, prompted the demand for wider and urgent research on the control of porina and the associated costs. Studies in porina population dynamics had been initiated as early as 1966 (Pottinger, 1967) but an epidemic population in 1967, coupled with the phasing out of D. D. T., increased the need for alternative control measures and greater understanding of the insect's behaviour. Because of the urgency to obtain a practical and cheap method of porina control, and the preliminary nature of this study, a broad based quantitative approach was used to develop meaningful but limited life tables. It was decided that such an approach would be best for a univoltine species and in view of the limited aims of the thesis it was not considered essential to develop complete and detailed life tables or to explore in depth all behavioural aspects of the insect. Instead, effort was concentrated into the study of those aspects which had some direct bearing on the practical and economic evaluation of the pest. It was thought that porina was amenable to ecological studies using life table methods. Except for the egg and juvenile larval stages it has reasonably large larval and adult stages and is relatively easy to sample. Areas for study are not difficult to find, but the insect does have the disadvantage (for life table work) of being univoltine. This could be advantageous in that there are no overlapping populations. The project briefly outlined below was designed to investigate the effect of porina populations on farm production and to study some aspects of the insect's ecology. 1. Development of sampling techniques for use in life table and other ecological studies. 2. 	(a) The study of the life cycle and natural history of the <b>pest.</b> 	(<b>b)</b> The development of life tables. 	(c) Economic assessment of the pest. 3. 	(a) Determination of the 'key mortality factors' regulating porina populations. (b) The practical testing of 'key mortality factors' as a means of control. 4.
