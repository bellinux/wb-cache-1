500|$|When SpongeBob SquarePants premiered, Plankton was {{not part}} of the series' main cast. Plankton's voice actor, Mr. Lawrence, has stated that after {{producing}} Plankton's debut episode in the late 1990s, creator Stephen Hillenburg was unsure if he would continue to use the character. After recording it, Hillenburg was noncommittal, telling Lawrence: [...] "We'll probably do another [...] next year," [...] Lawrence summarized Plankton's origins in 2015, saying that he [...] "was only supposed to be in one or two episodes, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> writer on the show and I really liked this character". Following his first voice recording as Plankton, Lawrence drafted some of his own ideas for the character and passed them to Hillenburg. From then on, Plankton began to appear more often. Lawrence considers the third season the first in which Plankton is a main character.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Octagonecologyst {{has been}} praised for its {{original}} sound, which {{has often been}} attributed to Nakamura. However, Thornton states that he was largely involved with {{the production of the}} album. Thornton is quoted as saying [...] "Automator and Kurt are probably receiving more credit than I did, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> big musical person behind Octagon." [...] Nakamura has said he wanted Dr. Octagonecologyst to stand out from other hip hop albums, citing the music of Eric B. & Rakim, Mantronix, and Run-D.M.C. as influences. [...] "Hip-hop was always inventive. Then the '90s hit and everyone wants to be Dr. Dre; {{no one wants to be}} their own thing anymore. Everyone now wants to have the Lexus and deal pounds of drugs. We don't do that. That's not our lifestyle. You don't see us coming out with the fur coat. There's more to music than that," [...] Nakamura said. The album incorporates use of organic instrumentation and features Moog synthesizer, flute, and string instruments.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... but I wanted to write, and I knew {{that would be the}} easiest thing to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think I always wanted to write, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While I could go out and say, even before I started to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't really say 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E

500|$|Grant began {{experimenting with}} the drug LSD in the late 1950s, before it became popular. His wife, Betsy Drake, {{displayed}} {{a keen interest in}} psychotherapy, and through her Grant developed a considerable knowledge of the field of psychoanalysis. Radiologist Mortimer Hartman began treating him with LSD in the late 1950s, with Grant optimistic that the treatment could make him feel better about himself and rid of all of his inner turmoil stemming from his childhood and his failed relationships. He had an estimated 100 sessions over several years. For a long time, Grant viewed the drug positively, and stated that it was the solution after many years of [...] "searching for his peace of mind", and that for {{first time in his life}} he was [...] "truly, deeply and honestly happy". Cannon claimed during a court hearing, in which she claimed he was an [...] "apostle of LSD", that he was still taking the drug in 1967 as part of a remedy to save their relationship. Grant later admitted that [...] "taking LSD was an utterly foolish thing to do <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> self-opinionated boor, hiding all kinds of layers and defences, hypocrisy and vanity. I had to get rid of them and wipe the slate clean".|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the leg, {{the band}} members were having trouble {{adjusting}} to their newfound fame as virtually every concert on the tour was sold out and Mother's Milk approached 500,000 units sold. Spin reported that following a show in Atlanta, Flea invited a woman to his hotel room for sexual intercourse, but locked himself in the bathroom upon arriving because all he could think of were his wife and daughter. Kiedis ended a two-year long relationship with actress Ione Skye, and Frusciante, looking back on the tour years later, admitted, [...] "I was totally abusing the situation [...] partying and screwing a bunch of girls. At 19, I might have looked like a stud <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> weakling inside. I wasn't proud of who I was then." [...] Shortly before {{the end of the}} North American leg, the band filmed a performance at the Long Beach Arena, which was released as Psychedelic Sexfunk Live from Heaven in 1990. A concert at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium on New Year's Eve 1989 attracted over 10,000 attendees and was considered by band photographer Tony Woolliscroft to be [...] "the biggest [...] I had seen them play at that point. It gave me a handle on how hard the band had worked in the USA in the years prior to this." [...] The tour continued in the United Kingdom, where the band was receiving less attention; Kiedis complained after several shows there, [...] "We're huge in the States and it's sort of frustrating and confusing that no one knows who we are here." [...] It was not until after their return from the UK that [...] "Taste the Pain" [...] was released as a single and subsequently charted at number twenty-nine there. In March 1990, the band was asked to perform on MTV's coverage of Spring break in Florida. At the event, Flea and Smith attempted to engage the audience by jumping from the stage; the situation got out of hand, and the two were alleged to have sexually assaulted and verbally abused a female audience member. They were arrested several days later on charges of battery, disorderly conduct and solicitation to commit a lascivious act, but released on $2,000 bail. Smith and Flea's arrest worsened Kiedis' impending charge in Virginia from the [...] "Positive Mental Octopus" [...] tour, for which the vocalist was ultimately convicted of sexual battery and indecent exposure and sentenced to pay a fine of $1,000 per charge.|$|E
500|$|After scoring 114 not {{out in a}} club {{match against}} Riverside, Ponting became the {{youngest}} player to appear for Tasmania in a Sheffield Shield match, breaking Boon's record by 14 days. In November 1992, {{at the age of}} 17 years and 337 days, he batted at number four in the order against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. Despite scoring 56 in a 127-run partnership with Boon, he could not prevent defeat, scoring just four in Tasmania's second innings. In his first match in Tasmania—this time against New South Wales—Ponting contributed 32 and 18 in a draw, before scoring 25 against Western Australia in a narrow loss. His first match in Sydney also marked the debut of future Australian opening bowler Glenn McGrath. At {{the end of the first}} day's play, Tasmania were 6/200, and Ponting was the only player to resist, reaching 98 not out. He eventually reached three figures the next morning, having endured three rain breaks and 54 minutes in the nineties. The century made him the youngest Tasmanian to score a first-class century, at 18 years and 40 days, eclipsing Boon's record of 19 years and 356 days. The next day he spoke about the achievement: [...] "I knew I had to be patient and wait for it to come [...] I wasn't that nervous last night, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bit nervous this morning." [...] Dismissed for 125 out of a total of 298, Ponting scored 17 boundaries in his five-and-a-half-hour stay at the crease. Coach Greg Shipperd was impressed in what he saw: [...] "It was an excellent innings, one of classical stroke play. The way he freely put together a good, solid innings, showed that his potential is being realised. It was an indication, for him, of what it's like to go the extra step." [...] These performances lead Ponting to his List A debut on 13 December against Victoria in Devonport. He struggled, however, scoring 22 from 45 balls in Tasmania's defeat. His form, nonetheless, remained strong in first-class cricket, scoring another half-century, Ponting scored back-to-back centuries against Western Australia in Perth, the nation's fastest wicket, thus becoming the youngest batsmen in Shield history to score two centuries in a match. After setting a goal of scoring 500 first-class runs in the season, Ponting finished with 781 runs at 48.81. But his form in List A games were not as strong, aggregating 99 at 33 in four matches. Still, Ponting hit an unbeaten 59 from 52 balls against a touring England A side in Hobart. After the season's end, still aged 18, Ponting played seven four-day games for the Australian Academy, scoring 484 runs at 96.70.|$|E
