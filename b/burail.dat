The CBI had opposed Rathore's plea and had sought an enhancement of his sentence from six months to the maximum of two years after his conviction. Rejecting his appeal against his conviction by a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) special court, Chandigarh District Court on 25 May sentenced the disgraced former police official to {{one and a half}} years of rigorous imprisonment, enhancing his earlier six-month sentence and immediately taken into custody and taken to the <b>Burail</b> prison.On 11 November 2010, the Supreme Court granted bail to S P S Rathore on the condition that he remain in Chandigarh.Recently Supreme Court of India upheld Rathore's conviction in molestation case but restricted the punishment to six months jail already served by him considering his age.|$|E
40|$|Outbreaks of {{varicella}} {{are reported}} when susceptible population accumulates. This study reports a chickenpox outbreak in <b>Burail</b> in August 2014, wherein 20 laboratory-confirmed cases {{were identified by}} the detection of varicella zoster virus (VZV) DNA and VZV IgM antibodies. The viral load between vesicular swabs and serum samples from 8 patients with active lesions {{was found to have}} good correlation and further also related with disease severity. Real-time polymerase chain reaction can be useful for early diagnosis of an outbreak and vesicular swab {{can be used as a}} less invasive sample for assessing the disease severity...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale rubella {{vaccination}} {{during the}} pastdecade has practically eliminated rubella andcongenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in manydeveloped and some developing countries [1, 2]. About 131 of the 194 WHO member States introduced rubella-containing vaccines (RCVs) in their routine immunization programmes along with measles and/or mumps by 2010 [1]. In India, {{there is a}} lack of comprehensive evidence about the true burden of rubella and CRS [2]. Setting up of reliable surveillance system for understanding local rubella epidemiology can provide such information. The present study was done to investigate an outbreak of exanthematous illness to document local descriptive epidemiology and to control the outbreak. METHODS In fourth week of May 2012, a four-year-old girl from an urbanized village, <b>Burail</b> in Chandigarh [3], reported to the health center in the field practice area of School of Public Health, PGIMER, with the complaints of fever and rash meeting the clinical description of measles [4]. Based on the details given by the index case, a team of two postgraduate resident doctors (each from School of Public Health and Department of Virology) from PGIMER, Chandigarh, visited the area with the aim to confirm and investigate the measles outbreak. Initial line listing of ten cases of febrile rash was done by rapid inquiry in neighbourhood houses of index case and in the nearby anganwadis. Blood samples were collected from thirty nine cases after informed consent of parents for serological testing. All the blood samples collected were found to be negative for measles IgM by ELISA (Novatech, Germany). These were then tested for rubella IgM antibodies by ELISA (Dialab, Italy) and twelve turned out to be positive. Thus, suspected measles outbreak turned out to be a confirmed rubella outbreak. House-to-house survey was done to investigate the outbreak further...|$|E
