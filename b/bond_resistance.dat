40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis focussed on the <b>bond</b> <b>resistance</b> of grouted soil nails in clay. Physical modelling {{took the form of}} large scale element tests in the laboratory of drilled and grouted nails in a stiff clay. Nails were installed under different boundary stresses; testing was conducted at different constant rates of pull-out and also under sustained load conditions. Observed behaviour was compared with that predicted by measurements of interface shear resistance obtained in a conventional shear box. Numerical modelling was carried out in an attempt to improve understanding of the effects of installation processes on nail performance, and to investigate the trends in behaviour observed during laboratory tests. For this purpose, a one-dimensional finite element computer program was developed to include the effects of consolidation and the out-of-plane soil displacements associated with nail axial loading. The physical modelling showed that the loading rate has a significant effect on <b>bond</b> <b>resistance.</b> This has consequences for the interpretation of data from constant rate of displacement pull-out testing, the conventional method of verifying <b>bond</b> <b>resistance</b> in the field. It is suggested that this type of testing is inappropriate in low permeability soils, because capillary suctions develop which lead to increased <b>bond</b> <b>resistance.</b> Results from laboratory sustained load tests show that lower values of <b>bond</b> <b>resistance</b> are mobilised under the static load conditions more likely to exist in a real soil nailed structure. The numerical modelling confirms the behaviour observed during the laboratory tests, and shows that the mechanisms by which bond is mobilised are complex, depending critically on the dilation and consolidation characteristics of the soil. Nail installation procedures are modelled, and grout pressures are shown to strongly influence <b>bond</b> <b>resistance.</b> Interface tests show trends in behaviour similar to those observed during pull-out testing. However, difficulties exist in the qualitative use of interface test data to predict nail <b>bond</b> <b>resistance...</b>|$|E

30|$|<b>Bond</b> <b>resistance</b> of {{reinforcing}} bars {{embedded in concrete}} depends primarily on frictional resistance and mechanical interlock. Chemical adhesion provides withholding property between steel and concrete. Frictional bond provides initial resistance against loading and further loading mobilizes the mechanical interlock between the concrete and bar ribs.

These cracks are commonly referred as Goto cracks (Goto 1971).|$|E
40|$|Adhesive joints have {{widespread}} {{applications in}} aerospace and automotive industries, but predicting catastrophic failures during dynamic loads {{is very difficult}} due to the inaccessibility of the bonded interface. We have developed a new technique based on carbon nanotube (CNT) sensors that can monitor the bond integrity and is capable to predict failure well in advance. The conductive network inside the adhesive is very sensitive to crack initiation, propagation and delamination, therefore in-situ measurement of the <b>bond</b> <b>resistance</b> is capable of recording events that lead to failure. In 90 % of the samples the change in <b>bond</b> <b>resistance</b> remains below 10 % of the initial value up to approximately 80 % of the fatigue life, and then the resistance increases rapidly due to crack propagation and interfacial delamination. As the increase in resistance typically occurs over a few hundreds to thousand cycles {{it is possible to}} define a resistance that corresponds to a safety limit before catastrophic failure. Moreover, the addition of 1 wt% MWCNTs inside the adhesive increased the joints shear strength and fatigue life by 10 % and 20 % respectively. The decrease in electrical resistance due to addition of only 0. 5 wt% was more than 7 orders of magnitude...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the ways}} to confront the problem of {{debonding}} failure of externally-bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP), used for strengthening of steel members, is to provide a proper and practical bonding detail. If the high stress-concentration zones of the bonded strip such as curtailment points of CFRP or member discontinuities are suitably detailed or reinforced, then <b>bonding</b> <b>resistance</b> will be improved. This paper describes experimentally the methods which successfully prevent the premature debonding failure of externally-laminated steel members. The double-lap shear test set up has been chosen as a frame work to compare the results. Therefore bond zones includes shear stresses and peel stresses. The mechanical clamps in different arrangements were examined as a bond-enhancement detail. Also, the effect of the length of the CFRP laminate was investigated along with different types of end mechanical anchorage. Finally, a simple and efficient bonding enhancement method has been proposed, in the form of overlapping the critical debonding zones using steel plates. The test results show that both the overlapping and clamping methods considerably increase the <b>bonding</b> <b>resistance,</b> but the former method is preferable because of its simplicity for installation and because in this case further increase of strength is obtained...|$|R

Although the interest {{for this kind}} of strengthening materials is increasing also for masonry structures, in particular for historic constructions, only few studies specifically pertained to masonry elements strengthened with SRPs are available in the literature. In this context, a twofold purpose is at the basis of the present paper.

40|$|Quality {{control of}} {{structural}} concrete {{has been conducted}} for several decades based mainly {{on the results of}} axial compression tests. This kind of test, although widely used, is not exempt from errors and has some considerable drawbacks that may affect its reliability, such as the need for appropriate and careful specimen conditioning and adoption of adequate capping techniques. For these reasons, {{it would be useful to}} have complementary or alternative ways to check compressive strength, in order to improve concrete quality control. The use of a bond test to monitor concrete strength is being proposed by an international group of researchers from France, Tunisia and Brazil as a potential means to this end. Given the fact that the link between <b>bond</b> <b>resistance</b> and concrete strength is already well established, this type of test seems to be a viable alternative to traditional methods. Nonetheless, to check if the underlying principle is sound when used in different circumstances, the group has been gathering data from several studies conducted by different researchers in various countries, with distinct concretes and rebar types. An analysis of the data collected shows that there is a clear and strong correlation between <b>bond</b> <b>resistance</b> and compressive strength, no matter the influence of other variables. This result validates the basic idea of using an Appropriate Pull-Out (APULOT) bond test to assess concrete strength. If the general principle is valid for random data obtained from different studies, the definition of a clear and appropriate test will probably lead to the reduction of experimental noise and increase the precision of the strength estimates obtained using this method...|$|E

40|$|The most {{universal}} {{measuring device}} for the electrical measurement of mechanical quantities is the strain gage. Several types of strain gages depend for their operation on the proportional variance of electrical resistance to strain: the piezoresistive or semi-conductor gage, the carbon resistive gage, the bonded metallic wire, and foil <b>resistance</b> gages. The <b>bonded</b> <b>resistance</b> strain gage {{is by far}} the most widely used in experimental stress analysis. This gage consists of a grid of very fine wire or foil bonded to a backing or carrier matrix. The electrical resistance of the grid varies linearly with strain. In use, the carrier matrix is bonded to the surface, force is applied, and the strain is found by measuring the change in <b>resistance.</b> The <b>bonded</b> <b>resistance</b> strain gage is low in cost, can be made with a short gage length, is only moderately affected by temperature changes, has small physical size and low mass, and has fairly high sensitivity to strain. In a strain gage application, the carrier matrix and the adhesive must work together to transmit the strain from the specimen to the grid. In addition, they combine to function as an electrical insulator and heat dissipator. The three primary factors influencing gage selection are: operating temperature, state of strain (gradient, magnitude, and time dependence), and the stability required. Because of its outstanding sensitivity, the Wheatstone bridge circuit is the most frequently used circuit for static strain measurement. Ideally, the strain gage is the only resistor in the circuit that varies, and then only due to a change in strain on the surface. There are two main methods used to indicate the change in resistance caused by strain on a gage in a Wheatstone bridge. Often, an indicator will rebalance the bridge, displaying the change in resistance required in micro-strain. The second method calls for installation of an indicator, calibrated in micro-strain, that responds to the voltage output of the bridge. This method assumes a linear relationship between voltage out and strain, an initially balanced bridge, and a known VIN. In reality, the VOUT-strain relationship is nonlinear, but for strains up to a few thousand micro-strain, the error is not significant...|$|R
