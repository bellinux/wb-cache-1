50|$|The volcano is set {{along the}} Zunil fault zone {{and has a}} central caldera {{surrounded}} by several dacitic and rhyolitic lava domes and formed in a back-arc volcanic setting, with activity commencing 84,000BP. Almolonga stratovolcano is the oldest edifice and underwent collapse prior to the caldera forming eruption of Lake Atitlan, the major chronological marker of volcanism in the region. The collapse of the stratovolcano left a caldera with a diameter of 3,3 km and a depth of 350m that was subsequently occupied by lava domes on its northern edge and covered by tephra layers from numerous volcanoes, both in the Almolonga field and others. Cerro Quemado is the largest (about 2 km3) and youngest lava dome complex formed by eight vents with viscous lava flows and plugs during four distinct volcanic phases - the first two involving effusion of lava and formation of new domes. Cerro Quemado underwent a flank collapse 1,150BP, generating a landslide that went 6 km SSW in the Llano de Pilar valley and occupied an area of 13 km2, generating a lateral blast that affected the neighbouring Volcán Siete Orejas volcano as well. A lava dome emerged inside the collapse scar subsequently. 1818 an eruption formed a <b>block</b> <b>lava</b> flow over half a year that travelled 2.5 km eastward.

It {{consists}} of well-preserved blocky lava flows with maximum thicknesses of 30 m. These are the youngest stages of Tuzgle volcanism and are well preserved. Radiating away from the central summit of the volcano, another lava flow unit forms the so-called Azufre synthem; these lava flows reach maximum thicknesses of 15 m and are gray to brownish-red with some evidence of hydrothermal alteration. On the northwestern and southern flanks, lava emission from one emission area down steep slopes form the San Antonio synthem (unconformity bounded unit), with lava flows up to 30 m thick. These San Antonio stage lavas have been cut by a 1.25 km long fault scarp trending NNE-SSW {{that may have been}} formed by a mass failure of the Tuzgle edifice, which was then rebuilt by the Azufre stage lavas. On the northern flank is found a volcaniclastic fan with a surface area of 12 km2, a volume of [...] and thicknesses of 30 - 40 m, presumably, considering its geochemical composition, formed by a mass failure of the San Antonio stage edifice. The scarp was probably formed by the same event but was not accompanied by explosive activity or a pyroclastic flow. This flank collapse may have been triggered by magma injection. A structure on the southern side of the volcano may also be a collapse scar, but no deposit is identifiable. A weakness zone running east-west cuts across the Tuzgle edifice, and some volcanic features are aligned along this weakness. A 5 km wide feeder dyke has been modelled and is associated with this weakness zone. The youngest- and best-exposed lava flow of Cerro Tuzgle originated in a group of three depressions bordered by 1 - 2 m scoria ridges. These depressions, presumably eruption fissures, are arranged in en echelon order. This youngest lava flow has a structure between <b>block</b> <b>lava</b> and aa lava. In non-volcanic terms patterned ground is found resulting from pre-glacial processes.Tuzgle is underpinned by a plateau formed by mostly unwelded ignimbrites, while the so-called [...] "Pre-platform", [...] "Platform", [...] "Post-platform" [...] and [...] "Young Flow" [...] units make up the central volcano. The moderately crystal-rich ignimbrite has a volume of [...] and is 80 m thick, and was presumably emitted from a caldera now buried by the Cerro Tuzgle edifice. Circular lava domes (50 m thick at a maximum) are found in the southeastern, eastern and northern sector of the volcano and may have formed along ring dykes associated with the caldera. A high electrical conductivity zone beneath Tuzgle may constitute a magma chamber embedded within porous material containing saline fluids with the bottom at a depth of at least 22 km and the top at a depth of 8 km. Crustal silicic magmas gave rise to ignimbrites from depths of 15 - 18 km. The magma chamber appears to be placed next to a crustal decollement at 20 km. Thermobarometric data also indicate a magma origin depth of 10 - 20 km. Beneath Tuzgle, a high seismic attenuation plume rises from an earthquake cluster at 200 km depth up to the volcano and is probably linked to asthenospheric upwelling.|$|E
40|$|International audienceLava flows occur worldwide, and {{throughout}} history,various cultures (and geologists) have described flowsbased on their surface textures. As a result, surfacemorphology-based nomenclature schemes have been proposedin most languages {{to aid in}} the classification and distinctionof lava surface types. One of the first to be publishedwas likely the nine-class, Italian-language description-basedclassification proposed by Mario Gemmellaro in 1858. By far,the most commonly used terms to describe lava surfaces todayare not descriptive but, instead, are merely words, specificallythe Hawaiian words ‘a‘ā (rough brecciated basalt lava) andpāhoehoe (smooth glassy basalt lava), plus <b>block</b> <b>lava</b> (thickbrecciated lavas that are typically more silicic than basalt). ‘A‘ā and pāhoehoe were introduced into the Western geologicalvocabulary by American geologists working in Hawai‘iduring the 1800 s. They and other nineteenth century geologistsproposed formal lava-type classification schemes for scientificuse, and most of them used the Hawaiian words. In 1933, Ruy Finch added the third lava type, <b>block</b> <b>lava,</b> to theclassification scheme, with the tripartite system being formalizedin 1953 by Gordon Macdonald. More recently, particularlysince the 1980 s and based largely on studies of lava flowinteriors, a number of sub-types and transitional forms of allthree major lava types have been defined.

On Surtsey, rates determined from DCA trajectory analyses decreased as follows: gull colony on lava with sand > gull colony on lava, no sand ≫ lava with sand > sand spit > <b>block</b> <b>lava</b> > tephra.

The succession rates of open meadows declined as follows: Lupinus -dominated pumice > protected ridge with Lupinus > other pumice and blasted sites > isolated lahar meadows > barren plain. Despite the prominent contrasts between the volcanoes, we found several common themes. Isolation restricted the number of colonists on Surtsey {{and to a lesser}} degree on Mount St. Helens. Nutrient input from outside the system was crucial. On Surtsey, seabirds fashioned very fertile substrates, while on Mount St. Helens wind brought a sparse nutrient rain, then Lupinus enhanced fertility to promote succession. Environmental stress limits succession in both cases. On Surtsey, bare lava, compacted tephra and infertile sands restrict development. On Mount St. Helens, exposure to wind and infertility slow succession...|$|E
40|$|The Dooley Rhyolite Breccia in {{northeast}} Oregon was erupted between 12 and 16 million years ago, from central vents and linear feeder dikes within the Dooley Mountain quadrangle. The peraluminous, high-silica rhyolites {{of the formation}} were erupted over an irregular highland of eroded pre-Tertiary metamorphic rocks locally overlain by intracanyon, Eocene Clarno-type basalt flow(s). The Dooley Rhyolite Braccia is exposed in a tectonically disrupted, north-south trending graben across the Elkhorn Range. The formation is variable in thickness with maximum thickness exceeding 660 meters {{in the south and}} 600 meters in the north half of the quadrangle. Volumetrically the formation is dominated by <b>block</b> <b>lava</b> flows with lessor associated volcaniclastic and pyroclastic rocks. Although initial and waning phases of eruption of the formation produced ash-flow tuffs which extend well beyond the quadrangle boundaries, volcanism within the quadrangle appears to have been primarily effusive. At least nine geochemically distinct rhyolite subunits belonging to four related chemical groups have been identified in the formation stratigraphy which appear to represent unique eruptive episodes. Chronologic geochemical patterns within the formation are consistent with a petrogenetic model of repeated partial melting and eruption from multiple silicic magma chambers in an attenuated continental crust. Basalts correlative with the Powder River Basalt and the Strawberry Volcanics overlie the Dooley Rhyolite Braccia on the north flank of Dooley Mountain. Cale-alkaline basalts correlative with the Strawberry Volcanics are overlain by thoeliitic basalts of uncertain affinity on the south flank of the mountain. These basalt flows on respective flanks of the mountain were not continuous across the quadrangle.

40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} means of extracting lava dome {{extrusion}} rates from data provided by the Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus instruments flown on the Landsat satellites. Extrusion rates derived from the Landsat data for Santiaguito dome complex (Guatemala) during November 1987 and January 2000 of 0. 72 € 0. 08 and 0. 48 € 0. 09 m 3 s– 1 compare favorably with ground-based estimates of 0. 63 € 0. 28 and 0. 48 € 0. 17 m 3 s– 1. A satellite-data-derived set of 18 extrusion rate estimates between 1987 and 2000, along with ground-based volume estimates prior to 1987, allow us to infer volumes of magma erupted since 1922. These data reveal cyclic extrusion at Santiaguito. Each cycle begins with a 3 – 6 -year-long phase of high extrusion rate (0. 5 – 2. 1 m 3 s– 1), followed by a longer (3 – 11 years) phase of low extrusion rate (£ 0. 2 m 3 s– 1). The 8 th cycle began in 1996 and was still in its high extrusion rate phase during January 2000. With time, however, the durations of the low extrusion rate phases have increased, peak extrusion and time-averaged extrusion rates for each cycle have decreased, {{and the difference between}} extrusion rates during the high and low extrusion rate phases of each cycle has decreased. These trends {{may be the result of}} depressurization and exhaustion of the source. In this case, the current eruption may be expected to end around 2020. Alternatively, Santiaguito may be entering a period of persistent activity maintained by a stable magma supply. In this case, we may expect extrusion to become less cyclic and to stabilize at 0. 2 – 0. 4 m 3 s– 1.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} different surface treatments of six novel CAD/CAM materials on the bonding effectiveness of two luting composites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six different CAD/CAM materials were tested: four ceramics - Vita Mark II; IPS Empress CAD and IPS e. max CAD; Celtra Duo - one hybrid ceramic, Vita Enamic, and one composite CAD/CAM <b>block,</b> <b>Lava</b> Ultimate. A total of 60 blocks (10 per material) received various mechanical surface treatments: 1. 600 -grit SiC paper; 2. sandblasting with 30 -μm Al 2 O 3; 3. tribochemical silica coating (CoJet). Subsequent chemical surface treatments involved either no further treatment (control), HF acid etching (HF), silanization (S, or HF acid etching followed by silanization (HF+S). Two specimens with the same surface treatment were bonded together using two dual-curing luting composites: Clearfil Esthetic Cement (self-etching) or Panavia SA Cement (self-adhesive). After 1 week of water storage, the microtensile bond strength of the sectioned microspecimens was measured and the failure mode was evaluated. RESULTS: The bonding performance of the six CAD/CAM materials was significantly influenced by surface treatment (linear mixed models, p < 0. 05). The luting cement had a significant influence on bond strength for Celtra Duo and Lava Ultimate (linear mixed models, p < 0. 05). Mechanical surface treatment significantly influenced the bond strength for Celtra Duo (p = 0. 0117), IPS e. max CAD (p = 0. 0115), and Lava Ultimate (p < 0. 0001). Different chemical surface treatments resulted in the highest bond strengths for the six CAD/CAM materials: Vita Mark II and IPS Empress CAD: S, HF+S; Celtra Duo: HF, HF+S; IPS e. max CAD: HF+S; Vita Enamic: HF+S, S. For Lava Ultimate, the highest bond strengths were obtained with HF, S, HF+S. Failure analysis showed a relation between bond strength and failure type: more mixed failures were observed with higher bond strengths. Mainly adhesive failures were noticed if no further surface treatment was done. The percentage of adhesive failures was higher for CAD/CAM materials with higher flexural strength (Celtra Duo, IPS e. max CAD, and Lava Ultimate). CONCLUSION: The bond strength of luting composites to novel CAD/CAM materials is influenced by surface treatment. For each luting composite, an adhesive cementation protocol can be specified {{in order to obtain}} the highest bond to the individual CAD/CAM materials. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This comment {{consists}} essentially {{of three}} well defined partes: the is first physical geography, the second hydrogeology {{and the last}} is hydrogeochemistry. The AA., after a preliminary and organic geological investigation which permitted {{the preparation of the}} map (Fig. 3) in which the various geolithologic units are corelated, then made a particular study of the principal geomorphologic structures present in the entire basin. The multiple presence of such structure is justified in the geological difference of the formations present. Among the typical structures of the basic vulcanites was the evidence of cushion lava, <b>block</b> <b>lava</b> and tabularcolumn lava; among the typical acid vulcanites are the stratoid lava and the cave like structures. Also the evidence were the pointed tabular structures, the concave tabular structures and the dip-shop, tabular structures present in the series of lava flows, and of porous stone deposits and sea deposits in alternate stratus. The part relative to the hydrogeology was preceded by an examination of the climatology and the hydrometry of the basinc. Five meteorological rain measuring stations and two thermometeorological rain measuring stations were used for this study and the following information were gathered: - the maximum precipitations were concentrated in the late autumn period, in winter and in the early spring; the maximum aridity was during the summer months; there is a great irregularity in the intensity of the precipitations; within the area of the basin proportional differences of values of precipitation due to altitudes do not exist. The hydrometric characteristics of the basin have been brought to light using the information of hydrometric data given by the station at Reinamare. From an hydrological point of view, by suddividing the general area into thre larges complexes based on their permeability, the most important hydrogeological series and water structures of the basin have been located. As well as this, 60 perpetual water springs have been registered, {{and for the most part}} they have been actually identified and their waters have been analized and studied. These analysis have proved the waters as belonging to three families: magnesium-chloride water, sodium-bicarbonate water and sodium-sulphate water. This latter water family which includes the majority of the springs, whose sources are diffused almost all over the enti re area of the basin, presents a fairly similar chemical characteristic as we have found by using linear co-relations with pairs of geochemical «parameters»...|$|E
