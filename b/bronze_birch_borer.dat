5|$|The larvae of a {{large number}} of species of butterflies, moths and other insects feed on the leaves and other parts of the silver birch. In Germany, almost 500 species of insect have been found on silver and downy birch {{including}} 106 beetles and 105 lepidopterans, with 133 insect species feeding almost exclusively on birch. Birch dieback disease can affect planted trees, while naturally regenerated trees seem less susceptible. This disease also affects Betula pubescens and in 2000 was reported at many of the sites planted with birch in Scotland during the 1990s. In the United States, the wood is attacked by the <b>bronze</b> <b>birch</b> <b>borer</b> (Agrilus anxius), an insect pest to which it has no natural resistance.|$|E
50|$|Birch leafminer is {{a common}} pest which feeds from inside of the leaf and causes the leaf to turn brown, the first {{generation}} appears in May {{but there will be}} several generations per year. Severe infestations may stress the tree and make it more vulnerable to the <b>bronze</b> <b>birch</b> <b>borer.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s most of {{the campus}} elms were felled by Dutch elm disease. In the 1970s the <b>Bronze</b> <b>birch</b> <b>borer</b> began killing the birches {{with the last of}} the {{original}} birches dying in 1997. Johanne Wynne Fairchild in 1979 began a process of cataloging the trees and setting up the trails.|$|E
50|$|Gray birch {{has been}} {{commonly}} planted as a landscaping tree in southern Pennsylvania and New Jersey as it tolerates {{heat and humidity}} better than paper birch and is more resistant to <b>bronze</b> <b>birch</b> <b>borers</b> and leaf miners.|$|R
50|$|When stressed, <b>bronze</b> <b>birch</b> <b>borers</b> may kill a tree. The insect bores {{into the}} sapwood, {{beginning}} {{at the top of}} the tree and causing death of the tree crown. The insect has a D shaped emergance hole where it chews out of the tree. Healthy trees are resistant to the borer but when grown in subideal conditions the defense mechanisms of the tree may not function properly. Chemical controls exist.|$|R
50|$|Like other North American birches, gray birch {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to the <b>Bronze</b> <b>birch</b> <b>borer</b> (Agrilus anxius). The leaves of the gray birch serve as food for various Lepidoptera, such as the leaf miner moth Cameraria betulivora. Between about 1930 and 1950, many gray birch trees, along with paper birch and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), were affected and killed by birch dieback disease.|$|E
50|$|While {{its native}} habitat is wet ground, {{it will grow}} on higher land, and its bark is quite distinctive, making it a favored {{ornamental}} tree for landscape use. A number of cultivars with much whiter bark than the normal wild type have been selected for garden planting, including 'Heritage' and 'Dura Heat'; these are notable as the only white-barked birches resistant to the <b>bronze</b> <b>birch</b> <b>borer</b> Agrilus anxius in warm areas of the southeastern United States of America.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bronze</b> <b>birch</b> <b>borer</b> Agrilus anxius is a wood-boring Buprestid beetle {{native to}} North America, more {{numerous}} in warmer {{parts of the}} continent and rare in the north. It is a serious pest on birch trees (Betula), frequently killing them. The river birch Betula nigra is the most resistant species, other American birches less so, while the European and Asian birches have no resistance to it at all and are effectively impossible {{to grow in the}} eastern United States as a result.|$|E
50|$|It is {{frequently}} planted as an ornamental {{due to its}} graceful form and attractive bark. The bark changes to the white color at about 3 years of growth. Paper birch grows best in USDA zones 2-6; due to its intolerance of high temperatures, Betula nigra, or river birch, is recommended for warm-climate areas warmer than zone 6 where paper birch is rarely successful. B. papyrifera is more resistant to the <b>bronze</b> <b>birch</b> <b>borer</b> than Betula pendula which is similarly planted as a landscape tree.|$|E
50|$|Birch dieback is {{a disease}} of birch trees that causes {{branches}} in the crown to die off. The disease may eventually kill the tree. In an event in the Eastern United States and Canada in the 1930s and 1940s, no causal agent was found, but the wood-boring beetle, the <b>bronze</b> <b>birch</b> <b>borer,</b> was implicated in the severe damage and death of the tree that often followed. In similar crown dieback occurrences in Europe several decades later, the pathogenic fungus Melanconium betulinum were found in association with affected trees, as well as Anisogramma virgultorum and Marssonina betulae.|$|E
50|$|Current {{research}} is aimed toward locating a predator or parasitoid that preys on the beetle larvae, {{but will not}} have serious impact on other native species. Until further study yields suggestions {{for the management of}} this pest insect, the US Forest Service advises forestry workers to use containment guidelines now in practice for the control of similar jewel beetle pests, such as the emerald ash borer and <b>bronze</b> <b>birch</b> <b>borer.</b> If the beetle was introduced to the area, it may have come in on firewood. Scientists advise against transporting oak wood since it may spread the pest.|$|E

50|$|A birch dieback event {{occurred}} in the eastern United States and Canada between about 1930 and 1950. Species affected included yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and gray birch (Betula populifolia) and several features were noted: the dieback was preceded by a reduction in growth rate, there was an east/west gradient, with eastern areas being more severely affected, and the trend was reversed in the 1950s. The <b>bronze</b> <b>birch</b> <b>borer</b> was found to attack and kill trees already weakened by the disease, and honey fungus (Armillaria spp.) invaded the root systems wreaking further damage. The disease was afterwards linked to a rise in temperature of 1 °C (2 °F) that {{occurred in}} eastern Canada at that time. This likely caused warmer soils with some tree rootlets dying, and trees under stress from other causes were {{the most likely to}} suffer.|$|E
40|$|The Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VKM) {{considers}} {{the probability of}} the <b>bronze</b> <b>birch</b> <b>borer</b> Agrilus anxius to establish and spread within Norway to be very high, if the borer enters the country. A large number of birch trees {{are likely to be}} killed, causing major economic and environmental consequences. These are conclusion given by VKM in a risk assessment requested by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Mattilsynet). Agrilus anxius is the most serious pest of birch trees in North America, causing widespread mortality of birch (Betula spp.) throughout the continent. So far the pest is not known to be present outside Canada and USA. VKM {{considers the}} probability of entry to Norway to be low to medium high. The endangered area is regarded as the forested area of southern Norway, south of Nordland County, and Pasvik in eastern Finnmark...|$|E
40|$|Increasing inter-continental {{trade of}} wood chips for biofuel {{represents}} a significant risk of introducing invasive pest species {{that can cause}} biome-scale impacts on forest ecosystems. Some potentially invasive species {{have the capacity to}} cause high tree mortality on the Eurasian continent and could cause significant impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Because eradication of established species is difficult, {{there is a need for}} scientific studies that can evaluate the reliability of current import control practices to ensure lowest possible risk of establishment of potentially harmful species. We used a stochastic simulation model and sensitivity analyses to evaluate the chance of detecting harmful pests in imported wood chips by sampling according to the current use of internationally accepted standards. As an example, we focused on the North American beetle Agrilus anxius (<b>bronze</b> <b>birch</b> <b>borer)</b> that can cause 100 % mortality of European and Asian birch species in North America. We simulated the process from logging in North America to sampling the wood chips upon arrival in Europe. The probability of pest detection for current sampling protocols used by port inspectors was very low (B 0. 00005), while a 90 % chance of detection may require sampling 27 million litres of wood chips per shipload...|$|E
40|$|The <b>bronze</b> <b>birch</b> <b>borer,</b> Agrilus anxius Gory, {{has found}} {{a new home in}} {{northern}} Nevada. Since the droughts of the early and late 90 s, the larval form of this beetle has killed several thousand mature birch trees in urban areas along the Sierra Front according to information collected by University of Nevada Cooperative Extension. Although the borer primarily attacks stressed trees, it is documented {{in other areas of the}} United States that borers attack healthy trees when their populations are on the rise. Detecting Borer Damage Birch trees weakened by drought or in poor health are prone to a borer attack. The worm stage of the adult (larvae) feeds primarily on plant tissue (phloem and cambium found under the bark). This cuts off the flow of water and nutrients to the tree, eventually killing roots. Because nutrients and water cannot flow to the roots, the leaves cease to produce sugar and starches. Initially symptoms of an infestation appear in the upper crown of the tree. Leaves often are yellow and sparse, then dieback occurs on branches three-fourths of an inch in diameter or larger (Fig. 1). The dieback progresses downward from the base (bole) of the tree each year. Other evidence of an infestation observed on the trunks and branches are the “D”–shaped holes. Rust colored sap oozing and staining the bark may also be seen, along with swelling and bumps where the tree has healed inside. The “D ” – shaped holes are produced when the adult beetle eats its way out from under the bark. Holes are small, one-fifth of an inch in diameter, and found near the base of infested limbs and the trunk. Because they are small, they can be easily overlooked (Fig. 2) ...|$|E
