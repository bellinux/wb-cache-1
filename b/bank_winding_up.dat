5000|$|This Florentine piazza was {{designed}} by architect Giuseppe Poggi and built in 1869 on a hill {{just south of the}} historic center, during the redevelopment of Oltrarno, the left (South) bank of the Arno river. In 1869, Florence was the capital of Italy and the whole city was involved in an urban renewal, the so-called [...] "Risanamento" [...] or the [...] "Renovation" [...] of the city's neighborhoods. Lungarni (riverside walkways; [...] "lungarno", singular) were built on the riversides. On the right bank, the fourteenth-century city walls were removed and turned into the Viali di Circonvallazione, mimicking the French [...] "boulevard" [...] design, six lanes wide and lined with trees. On the left <b>bank</b> <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> the hill of San Miniato the Viale dei Colli was built, a tree-lined street over 8 kilometers long ending at the Piazzale Michelangelo which was built as a terrace with a panoramic view of the city.|$|E

50|$|In 1923 the Italian {{engineer}} and FIAT agent Giovanni Marcellino {{is said to}} have been sent by the <b>banks</b> to <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the Puch factory in Graz. Instead of which, within a few weeks he had settled down to live in the town, designing and then producing a new version of the split-single. Taking his inspiration from industrial counter-piston engines, the new engine benefited from the improved breathing of the Italian original, to which he added asymmetric port timing. In 1931 Puch won the German Grand Prix with a supercharged split-single, though in subsequent years the split-singles of DKW did better.|$|R
50|$|The Hong Kong listed {{company was}} {{suspended}} from trading by the exchange after Glaucus, a short seller investment research firm, published {{a report that}} alleged sales stated by the company were fraudulently inflated and its claim {{to have the most}} production capacity volume was misleading. Following turmoil for the company created by the report, in January 19, 2015, one of its creditors, Taiwan-based Mega <b>Bank,</b> filed a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> petition against Lumena to institute involuntary insolvency proceedings for the company before the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands.|$|R
60|$|With resumption, free banking may be {{authorized}} with safety, {{giving the}} same full protection to bill holders {{which they have}} under existing laws. Indeed, I would regard free banking as essential. It would give proper elasticity to the currency. As more currency should be required for the transaction of legitimate business, new banks would be started, and in turn <b>banks</b> would <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> their business when {{it was found that}} there was a superabundance of currency. The experience and judgment of the people can best decide just how much currency is required for the transaction of the business of the country. It is unsafe to leave the settlement of this question to Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Executive. Congress should make the regulation under which banks may exist, but should not make banking a monopoly by limiting the amount of redeemable paper currency that shall be authorized. Such importance do I attach to this subject, and so earnestly do I commend it to your attention, that I give it prominence by introducing it {{at the beginning of this}} message.|$|R

5000|$|A {{company may}} go into <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> either voluntarily or {{by order of}} the court. [...] A company enters {{voluntary}} <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> by passing a special resolution to appoint a liquidator.

25|$|An {{accounting}} period ends {{and a new}} one begins with the commencement of a <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b> For this purpose a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> is taken to commence on the passing of a resolution for the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company, or on the presentation of a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> petition if no such resolution has previously been passed and a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> order is made on the petition, or on the doing of any other act for a like purpose {{in the case of}} a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> otherwise than under the Insolvency Act 1986.|$|R
50|$|In a {{compulsory}} <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> the day {{on which}} the relevant Court order is made will constitute {{the date of the}} commencement of the <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b> The date on which the application to <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the company was filed is called the relation-back day.

25|$|During {{the course}} of a <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> a company may make an {{estimate}} of when it will be wound up so that it can prepare tax returns for its final accounting period before that period ends. If the date assumed for the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> turns out to be before the actual <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> then an accounting period ends on the date assumed for the <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> a new accounting period starts, and the immediately preceding paragraph applies as if the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> had started with that accounting period.|$|R

40|$|I have {{my thesis}} {{dividend}} into two parts.

In the second part I made up an imaginary limited lability company (I couldn't get any real dates from the existing company because they are all subject of business secret) and tried to illustrate the process of <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company with liquidation. I put emphasis on particular steps of liquidator and the formal standpoints of the liquidation process...|$|R

50|$|In {{practice}} {{the most important}} grounds tend to be insolvency (the fourth ground) and just and equitable <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> (the sixth ground). Just and equitable <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> is usually unrelated to the solvency of the company.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} issues arising in {{cross-border}} or international insolvency is the local recognition and effect of concurrent foreign insolvency proceedings. As a foreign company may be wound up in Australia (see Pt 5. 7 and Pt 5 B. 2 of the Corporations Law), a local liquidation may be taking place when {{the company is also}} being wound up in its place of incorporation. If this occurs, the foreign <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> is regarded as the principal <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> and the local one as merely ancillary: Re English Scottish & Australian Chartered Bank [1893] 3 Ch 385. The local ancillary <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> concentrates on getting in and realising local assets and may result in funds being remitted to the principal <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> for distribution. If any issue in the local <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> comes before the local court, it must apply local law, including local insolvency law, to its resolution: Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 10) [1997] Ch 213. ...|$|R

500|$|After moving ashore, {{an area of}} {{convection}} redeveloped over Helene's {{center and}} the circulation became well-defined on radar imagery. The storm accelerated to the northeast into the Westerlies, and about six hours following its landfall, Helene weakened to tropical depression status after crossing into southeastern Alabama. A few hours later, the NHC issued the last advisory on the system and transferred warnings to the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center. Hurricane forecast models anticipated restrengthening, and due to the forecast track north of the Gulf Stream, the NHC predicted intensification as an extratropical cyclone. The agency noted that Tropical Storm Danny re-intensified in the same region as a tropical cyclone. Despite strong wind shear, convection increased over Helene's center as the storm moved through North Carolina. Stations along the Outer <b>Banks</b> reported sustained <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> to [...] Satellite imagery and buoy data indicated that Helene re-intensified into a tropical storm inland over North Carolina.
