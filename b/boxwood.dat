5|$|He is {{credited}} with popularising a technical innovation in the printing of illustrations using wood. He adopted metal-engraving tools to cut hard <b>boxwood</b> across the grain, producing printing blocks that could be integrated with metal type, but were much more durable than traditional woodcuts. The result was high-quality illustration at a low price.|$|E
5|$|Gaylussacia brachycera {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from {{other members of}} its genus by its leaves: they resemble those of <b>boxwood</b> (hence its name) and lack the resin glands typical of huckleberries. Like its relatives, it bears white urn-shaped flowers in the early summer, which develop to blue, edible berries in late summer. It is mostly found in Appalachia; many of its stations there were known to natives, who picked and ate the berries, before botanists became aware {{of them in the}} 1920s.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, {{what would}} become DE 4 existed as a county road. The road from Stanton to Wilmington was paved four years later and the portion west of Stanton was paved by 1936. In 1936, work was {{underway}} to improve the road between Stanton and Newport by widening and resurfacing it, with completion a year later. In 1957, Maryland Avenue between Silview and <b>Boxwood</b> Road was widened to four lanes and the one-way pair along Market Street and Justis Street in Newport was established.|$|E

A frame house painted white, Marrowbone plantation was known widely for its hanging gardens and colonial <b>boxwoods</b> and cedars. John D. Rockefeller's gardeners scoured the countryside for authentic <b>boxwoods</b> or Buxus sempervirens for Colonial Williamsburg, and used some of the shrubs and cedars from Marrowbone for the restoration.|$|R

The gardens at Cedar Grove were reputedly laid out by Andre Michaux, the renowned botanist who had designed the gardens at Middleton Place in Charleston, South Carolina.

The restaurant cost £2.5 million to set up, and Ramsay signed an initial lease for ten years with the airport. The chef patron of the restaurant is Stuart Giles, who had previously worked at Ramsay's <b>Boxwood</b> Cafe. Since September 2015 Executive Chef is Andrew Winstanley.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} in the southeast were scarcely affected by the 19th century restoration apart from the chapel. Many of {{the walls of the}} 12th century tower have survived, partly rebuilt in the 15th century, and there are traces of a Romanesque chapel. The park was redesigned in the 19th century, enclosed in dry stone walls with several entrances. These have since been removed, as have the luxuriant gardens of the 18th century. Some traces remain in the form of <b>boxwood,</b> some alleys, the pools on the two terraces and the rockery.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boxwood</b> {{cut across}} the end-grain is hard enough for fine engraving, {{allowing}} greater detail than in normal woodcutting. This been the dominant method used since Bewick's time. In addition, since a wood engraving is inked on the face, it requires only low pressure to print an image, so the blocks last for many thousands of prints, and importantly can be assembled into a page of metal type for ordinary printing in a single run. In contrast, a copper plate engraving is inked in the engraved grooves, the face being wiped clean of ink before printing, so much higher pressure is required, and images must be printed separately from the text, at far greater expense.|$|E

The church is surrounded on its northeastern, southeastern, and southwestern sides by a cemetery which is still in use.

5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably <b>boxwood,</b> were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E
