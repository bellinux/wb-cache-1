25|$|Laurent {{took a few}} steps, not speaking. He {{removed his}} jacket and vest. In shirtsleeves, he glanced again at Thérèse, who had not stirred. He seemed to hesitate. Then he noticed the pink shoulder, and <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> to press his {{trembling}} lips against that bit of bare skin. The young woman pulled her shoulder away, turning around abruptly. She stared at Laurent with a gaze so strangely mingling repugnance and dread that he stepped back, troubled and uneasy, as if overcome with terror and disgust himself.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} Owen's {{tactical}} mind {{was seen in}} one of his early international matches against England in 1902. Wales were behind in the game with little time remaining when Owen tricked his opposite number, Bernard Oughtred, into an off-side tackle near the English posts. With the Welsh in charge of the scrum on the English '25', Owen told his forwards, in Welsh, to keep hold of the ball, while Owen <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and pretended to collect it. Oughtred came around the scrum to tackle Owen and finding the Welshman empty handed was penalised for being off-side. John Strand-Jones kicked the penalty, allowing Wales to win 9-8.|$|E
25|$|Park also notched up {{some fine}} {{performances}} for Victoria, and soon earned a Test call-up in the 1920–1921 season. He was unsuccessful in his debut against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), making a first-ball duck in his only innings, and bowling a single over of off-spinners which went for nine runs. He {{was said to}} have been called late during the night for medical duties, and not to have got any sleep before his debut. He never played Test cricket again. Legend has it that his wife, who was watching in the stands, dropped her knitting as he prepared to face his first ball, <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> to retrieve it at the moment of delivery, and thus missed his entire Test career.|$|E

25|$|Beginners {{often make}} the mistake of not {{relaxing}} the arm during the recovery and of moving the hand too high and too far away from the body, in some cases even higher than the elbow. In these cases, drag and incidental muscle effort is increased at the expense of speed. Beginners often forget to use their shoulders to let the hand enter as far forward as possible. Some say the hand should enter the water thumb first, reducing drag through possible turbulence, others say the middle finger is first with the hand precisely <b>bent</b> <b>down,</b> giving thrust right from the start. At the beginning of the pull, the hand acts like a wing and is moved slower than the swimmer while at the end it acts like an oar and is moved faster than the swimmer.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, 2011, Jones {{travelled}} to Russia to face Denis Lebedev (21-1, 16 KOs), who {{had just}} come off a controversial split decision loss to Marco Huck, at the Dynamo Palace of Sports in Krylatskoye. Lebedev was ranked #4 at cruiserweight by The Ring. Weighing in at 198lbs, Jones looked slow and old. Despite this, he gave a decent showing and was heading {{for at least a}} split-decision loss {{at the beginning of the}} 10th round (84-87, 86-85 & 81-90). However, with less than 20 seconds remaining, Lebedev landed a big right followed by an uppercut. Jones, having <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> holding his head and in no position to continue, was then hit by a final big right hand as Steve Smoger hesitated to stop the fight handing Jones his third consecutive defeat. Jones lay on the canvas for several minutes before getting up.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, he was in Đà Lạt {{when his}} plane had no fuel left, and no pumps were open at the time, so he was marooned there for the night. Fearing a Khánh comeback, the AFC met again and {{unanimously}} resolved to make contingency plans to repel any counter-insurrection by Khánh. Westmoreland sent Colonel Wilson, Khánh's former confidant, to go to the military airport at Đà Lạt to convince the Vietnamese general to resign and allow a new military leadership to take the reins. Khánh finally agreed to leave if he was given a dignified send-off, so the other generals arranged a ceremony at Tan Son Nhut, where military bands serenaded him. He theatrically <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and picked up some loose dirt before putting it in his pocket, saying that he was taking his beloved homeland with him. His enemies, the remaining Vietnamese officers and Taylor, all met him at the airport. He then left as Ambassador-at-Large, and was sent on a world tour, starting with a report at the United Nations in New York City.|$|E

500|$|Gérôme made {{at least}} two {{previous}} oil paintings {{and a number of}} sketches in preparation for the work. [...] One [...] shows Cleopatra lying on the ground stretching out to Julius Caesar [...] with Apollodorus crouching behind her. [...] In one variation before the finished version, Caesar is shown by himself with his hands on the desk (instead of outstretched) without his four secretaries. When the work was finished in 1866, Cleopatra's position changed to show her standing before Caesar with Apollodorus <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> beside her.|$|E
500|$|At around 16:15, Linge ordered SS-Untersturmführer Heinz Krüger and SS-Oberscharführer Werner Schwiedel {{to roll up}} the rug in Hitler's {{study to}} burn it. Schwiedel later stated that upon {{entering}} the study, he saw {{a pool of blood}} the size of a [...] "large dinner plate" [...] by the arm-rest of the sofa. Noticing a spent cartridge case, he <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and picked it up from where it lay on the rug about 1mm from a 7.65 pistol. The two men removed the blood-stained rug, carried it up the stairs and outside to the Chancellery garden. There the rug was placed on the ground and burned.|$|E
500|$|The plane bent upon {{landing at}} Juanda International Airport, with the {{fuselage}} breaking {{in the middle}} of the passenger section. The landing was particularly hard, with baggage being ejected from cabin lockers into the cabin space. The tail section of the plane was <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> compared to the rest of the plane. Subsequent flights to the airport were diverted to alternate airports. Adam Air's fleet of Boeing 737-300s were grounded for safety inspections in the interim. Immediately after the accident, Adam Air repainted the aircraft, covering the original orange livery with a plain white exterior. This is legally permissible, so long as no evidence is destroyed. Also in the immediate aftermath, a large number of passengers cancelled their flights with Adam Air, saying they had [...] "lost faith" [...] in the airline. They were all refunded in full.|$|E

500|$|Although Woodfull led Australia to a {{dramatic}} victory by 111 runs, his form {{was a problem}} as he managed only 10 and 26; he was also hit by the bowling. The bodyline controversy reached its peak during {{the second day of}} the third Test. An all-time record Adelaide Oval crowd of 50,962 watched Australia finish off England's first innings for 341. Then, Woodfull opened Australia's batting with Jack Fingleton, who was dismissed straight away for a duck. Minutes later Larwood, bowling to a conventional field setting, struck Woodfull an agonising blow under his heart with a short, lifting delivery. As Woodfull <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> over his bat in pain for several minutes, an image that became one of the defining symbols of the series, the huge crowd began jeering, hooting and verbally abusing the English team, something that was almost unheard of for the social standards of the era. Jardine reacted by saying [...] "Well bowled, Harold".|$|E
500|$|Khánh {{finally agreed}} to leave if {{he was given a}} dignified send-off, so the other generals {{arranged}} a ceremonial farewell at Tan Son Nhut on February 24. Military bands played as he theatrically <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and picked up some loose dirt before putting it in his pocket; Khánh said he was taking his beloved homeland with him, and vowed to one day return. His enemies, the remaining Vietnamese officers, most notably Kỳ and Thi, as well as Taylor, all met him at the airport. The foes managed smiles and handshakes for the media cameras. To make the coup [...] "appear as much as possible the doing of Vietnamese themselves", Taylor had not made any public statement after Khánh’s ouster, on orders from the State Department. Wearing his Grand Cross of the National Order, and carrying two more plastic bags filled with Vietnamese soil, Khánh then left as Ambassador-at-Large, and was sent on a meaningless world tour, starting with a report to the United Nations in New York City.|$|E
500|$|The 5th {{segment of}} the five-segment Matsudaira clan scroll was {{separated}} in 1932 and mounted as hanging scroll. This fragment is [...] wide. Named after their present owners, it {{is known as the}} Morikawa clan edition. It consists of a single scene with a very short illustration showing the inside of a traditional Japanese style room with fusuma sliding doors, tatami and a curtain. Like all but the first segment of this scroll, the scene is set in the evening of Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008) on occasion of the 50th day celebration of the birth of Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō. Murasaki Shikibu and Saishō no Kimi had been hiding from the drunken carousal of that evening, but were discovered by Michinaga, Saishō no Chūjō and others. The painting is dominated by the massive figure of Fujiwara no Michinaga dressed in brocade jacket and trousers and placed in the centre of the room. Murasaki Shikibu and Saishō no Kimi are huddled near the border of the painting with heads <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> as a sign of submission and deference.
