5|$|Benzema {{got off to}} a {{good start}} for the 2008–09 season, scoring twice in Lyon's opening league match against Toulouse. The {{following}} three weeks, he scored goals against Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble and Saint-Étienne and scored a goal against Nice, converting a penalty in the dying seconds. Lyon won all three matches. As a result of his early goals, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas quelled the many transfer rumors surrounding Benzema <b>by</b> <b>placing</b> <b>a</b> €100million price tag on the striker. He was also nominated alongside Franck Ribéry to be featured on the French cover of the video game FIFA 09.|$|E
5|$|Corona Australis {{has been}} {{associated}} with the myth of Bacchus and Stimula. Jupiter had impregnated Stimula, causing Juno to become jealous.

5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, <b>by</b> <b>placing</b> <b>a</b> pointed iron on a rooftop, with {{the other end of}} the rod placed deep into the ground. The sharp point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, Neoclassical {{architectural}} elements {{began to appear in}} the federal style row homes, such as iconic columns in the porticoes and classic motifs over doorways and windows.

Greek and Roman elements were integrated into public buildings such as the old City Hall, the old Norfolk Academy, and the Customs House.|$|E
5|$|The Wii's success caught {{third-party}} developers by surprise, {{leading to}} apologies {{for the quality}} of their early games. In an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel, Ubisoft's Yves Guillemot and Alain Corre admitted that they made a mistake in rushing out their launch titles, promising to take future projects more seriously. Take-Two Interactive, which released few games for the Nintendo GameCube, changed its stance towards Nintendo <b>by</b> <b>placing</b> <b>a</b> higher priority on the Wii.|$|E

5|$|Unbeknownst to the Byzantines, Khalid had {{prepared}} {{for such a}} contingency <b>by</b> <b>placing</b> <b>a</b> strong outpost line in front during the night to counter surprises, which gave the Muslims {{time to prepare for}} battle.

5|$|Abu Bakar {{was noted}} for his {{diplomatic}} skills, {{and both the}} British and Malay rulers had approached him for advice in making important decisions. He was also an avid traveller, {{and became the first}} Malay ruler to travel to Europe during his first visit to England in 1866. In particular, Abu Bakar became a lifetime friend of Queen Victoria in his later years. Abu Bakar's friendship with Queen Victoria {{played an important role in}} shaping Johor's relationships with Britain, and was the only state by the end of the 19th century in the Peninsular Malaya to maintain autonomy in its internal affairs as the British Colonial Government pushed for greater control over the Malay states <b>by</b> <b>placing</b> <b>a</b> British Resident in the states. He was also an Anglophile, and many of his personal habits and decisions were aligned to European ideas and tastes.|$|E

5|$|On two issues, women's suffrage, and the {{prohibition}} of alcohol, where picking the wrong side would have damaged his presidential prospects in 1920, he prospered by taking nuanced positions. As senator-elect, he indicated {{that he could not}} support votes for women until Ohio did. Increased support for suffrage there and among Senate Republicans meant that by the time Congress voted on the issue, Harding was a firm supporter. Harding, who drank, initially voted against banning alcohol. He voted for the Eighteenth Amendment, which imposed Prohibition, after successfully moving to modify it <b>by</b> <b>placing</b> <b>a</b> time limit on ratification, which was expected to kill it. Once it was ratified anyway, Harding voted to override Wilson's veto of the Volstead Bill, which implemented the amendment, assuring the support of the Anti-Saloon League.|$|E
5|$|Set on {{the prosperous}} Long Island of 1922, The Great Gatsby {{provides}} a critical {{social history of}} America during the Roaring Twenties within its fictional narrative. That era, known for unprecedented economic prosperity, the evolution of jazz music, flapper culture, new technologies in communication (motion pictures, broadcast radio, recorded music) forging a genuine mass culture; and bootlegging, along with other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald uses these societal developments of the 1920s to build Gatsby's stories from simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which {{was the source of}} Gatsby's fortune. Fitzgerald educates his readers about the garish society of the Roaring Twenties <b>by</b> <b>placing</b> <b>a</b> timeless, relatable plotline within the historical context of the era.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} duality applies {{as well to}} {{infinite}} graphs embedded in the plane {{as it does to}} finite graphs. However, care is needed to avoid topological complications such as points of the plane that are neither part of an open region disjoint from the graph nor part of an edge or vertex of the graph. When all faces are bounded regions surrounded by a cycle of the graph, an infinite planar graph embedding can also be viewed as a tessellation of the plane, a covering of the plane by closed disks (the tiles of the tessellation) whose interiors (the faces of the embedding) are disjoint open disks. Planar duality gives rise to the notion of a dual tessellation, a tessellation formed <b>by</b> <b>placing</b> <b>a</b> vertex at the center of each tile and connecting the centers of adjacent tiles.|$|E

5|$|The electors {{were then}} told {{to break up}} the Convention and {{assemble}} into the formal Assembly or Council. The electors voted <b>by</b> <b>placing</b> <b>a</b> pebble or written ballot into an appropriate jar. The baskets that held the votes were watched by specific officers, who then counted the ballots, and reported the results to the presiding magistrate. The majority of votes in any Curia, Tribe, or Century decided how that Curia, Tribe, or Century voted. Each Curia, Tribe, or Century received one vote, regardless of how many electors each Tribe or Century held. Once a majority of Curiae, Tribes, or Centuries voted in the same way on a given measure, the voting ended, and the matter was decided.|$|E
5|$|Confronting Joyce {{about the}} story, Lois {{questions}} her intentions, with Joyce revealing {{that the two}} attended high school together, where she was known as Joyce Chevapravatdumrong. She also reveals that Lois humiliated {{her in front of}} the entire school, <b>by</b> <b>placing</b> <b>a</b> hotdog in her mouth and pulling down her pants while blindfolded (revealing her pink underwear), and has sought revenge ever since. At church the next day, Lois and her family enter, and are immediately demanded to leave by the preacher. Becoming extremely depressed, Lois is eventually coaxed by Brian to face her mistake by showing it to the church. The porno causes the church to reaccept her and admit the Griffin family back into their congregation due to a positive opinion of the film, much to Joyce's anger. Stewie in the meantime develops suspicions of having been conceived through the creation of the porno, heightened when he sees that one of the actors has a football-shaped head like his.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag has {{a length of}} 2.20meters and a width of 1.47m, a ratio of 2 to 3. The field is split into three horizontal colored bands, a yellow band of one-half the flag's width, a blue band of one-quarter the width, and a red band of one-quarter the width. All three bands extend {{the full length of}} the flag. The flag is charged with the Ecuadorian coat of arms scaled to one-half the width of the flag and centered in the field. The coat of arms itself is constructed in a rectangle with proportions 12:10. The national standard has the same design as the {{national flag}}, but is square, with length 0.9m and width 0.9m. When used by military units and organizations, lettering can encircle the coat of arms with a diameter of 55 centimeters. The lettering must be 4cm in height, 3cm in width, gold-colored Roman font, embroidered with gold thread. The only other regulated size is a table flag (banderola) where the flag is 200mm wide and 300mm long. When manufacturing the national flag, sellers to the public must include the name of their company, along with the year of manufacture, <b>by</b> <b>placing</b> <b>a</b> 20 × 10mm tag on the reverse side of the flag on the sleeve.|$|E
