25|$|In July 2011, Rodger {{followed}} a couple he {{was jealous of}} out of a Starbucks in Goleta and threw coffee on them. In a later incident, he splashed his latte on two girls sitting {{at a bus stop}} in Isla Vista for not smiling <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> In July 2012, Rodger purchased a Super Soaker, filled it with orange juice, and used it to spray a group playing kickball at Girsh Park.|$|E
25|$|The game also {{includes}} an alternate final level, where the final battle is played from Leo's perspective. He successfully destroys Daniel's personality and {{wakes up in}} control of his mind and body. Whyte, who thinks she is speaking to Daniel, asks him if he is okay, to which he replies he is keen {{to get back to}} work on the Bridge. As he looks at himself in the mirror, Daniel sees Leo's reflection looking <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{failure was}} a factor with the Italian's 2006 campaign, {{with the loss of}} podium {{finishes}} occurring all too often. It took Trulli until round 9 to score points, but he did so with 6th place after qualifying 4th. More great results followed, with his run from 22nd to 4th at Indianapolis standing out. However, it was a year with a notable lack of points scored, and did nothing for Trulli's reputation, allowing his critics to claw <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the opinion}} of Sasha Sokolov:It seems he was only really {{appreciated}} by professionals. Living here and now, in Tel-Aviv, I remember our few meetings and frequently walk along Ben Yehuda Street, past his house... Sasha is difficult. He's not only difficult stylistically, but also philosophically. He offers up his immense knowledge without thinking of the reader, without glancing <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> – a knowledge of art, science, philology, naturally. I can {{understand the value of}} his texts, but I don't understand how they were made.|$|E
25|$|Medawar's {{theory was}} further {{developed}} by George C. Williams in 1957, who noted that senescence may be causing many deaths, even if animals are not 'dying of old age.' In the earliest stages of senescence, an animal may lose {{a bit of}} its speed, and then predators will seize it first, while younger animals flee successfully. Or its immune system may decline, and it becomes the first to die of a new infection. Nature is such a competitive place, said Williams, (turning Medawar's argument <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him),</b> that {{even a little bit}} of senescence can be fatal; hence natural selection does indeed care; ageing isn't cost-free.|$|E
25|$|Hawkins {{had told}} me aboard the ship that he would put his platoon of men up against any company of {{soldiers}} on earth and guarantee to win. He was slightly wounded by shrapnel as he came ashore in the first wave, but {{the furthest thing from}} his mind was to be evacuated. He led his platoon into the forest of coconut palms. During {{a day and a half}} he personally cleaned out six Jap machine gun nests, sometimes standing on top of a track and firing point blank at four or five men who fired <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> from behind blockhouses. Lieutenant Hawkins was wounded a second time, but he still refused to retire. To say that his conduct was worthy of the highest traditions of the Marine Corps is like saying the Empire State Building is moderately high.|$|E

25|$|Bourque then {{fled the}} woods and emerged {{southeast}} of McCoy Street, where he continued walking {{in a straight line}} on Mailhot Avenue. There, two minutes after he shot Gevaudan, he encountered Cst. David Ross, who was driving a police sports utility vehicle down the road. Ross drew his service pistol and accelerated his vehicle towards Bourque as he was turning to face his direction. Ross fired two shots at Bourque through his windshield, while Bourque fired six shots <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Ross was shot twice in the hand and left shoulder, with a third fatal shot being directed at the head. It was believed he was attempting to hit Bourque with his vehicle or get within range to open fire with his service weapon.Cst. Eric White later found Ross's body still slumped inside the driver's seat before being forced to take cover behind the vehicle after spotting Bourque taking aim at him from further down the street.|$|E
25|$|Kane then rekindled his {{feud with}} Edge, who, on the October 28 episode of SmackDown, {{was named the}} new {{challenger}} to Kane's World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series. On the November 12 episode of SmackDown, Edge kidnapped Bearer and started to play mind games with Kane, trying to psychologically wear him down before their title match. At Survivor Series, Kane retained his title after the referee determined the match a draw due to both men pinning {{each other at the}} same time. As Edge still had Bearer in his captivity, Kane agreed to a rematch at the next pay-per-view. On December 3, Edge defeated Kane in a non-title match to win the right to determine the stipulation for the title match; Edge chose a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match before leaving Kane with a Paul Bearer lookalike and driving away with the genuine Bearer strapped to the back of a truck. The following week, Kane accidentally injured Bearer, believing it to be another hoax by Edge, and Bearer was written out of the storyline. The week after, Kane rampaged into the stadium to hunt down Edge hoping to get <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> but the two were nearly restrained by the entire Smackdown roster.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, J.T. and Colleen {{become friends}} again and she stands by him while his {{pregnant}} fiance, Victoria, is in a coma. When Colleen's father goes missing in 2009, {{she goes to}} J.T. for help finding him. They discover his dead body frozen in the ice of the river. He comforts her while she deals with her loss. Colleen blames Brad's longtime enemy and J.T.'s father-in-law, Victor Newman (Eric Braeden), for her father's death and attempts to get <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> by claiming Brad's seat on the Newman board. Victor orders J.T. to find something damaging on Colleen that will force her {{to give up the}} seat. J.T. does not follow Victor's orders, but Victor gets what he wants by paying Gloria and Jeffry Bardwell to catch Colleen in a compromising position. They pay a bartender to get her drunk. Under the influence of alcohol, she flashes her breasts in public, which Jeffrey catches on camera. Once the footage of her is made public, Colleen is asked to resign from the Newman board. This only brings J.T. and Colleen closer. They begin bringing up suppressed feelings and on August 17, 2009 they kiss and are spotted by a spy of Victor's. This soon is heard by the Newmans that J.T. was seen coming out of Colleen's home the next morning. Colleen is confronted by J.T.'s wife, Victoria. Colleen is kidnapped by her Uncles Jack's unstable ex-wife, Patty Williams. She escapes by canoe on the lake but falls into the water and nearly drowns. She is found by Jack and brought to the hospital. On September 22, it is confirmed that Colleen is brain dead because of her accident on the lake. On September 28, the doctors announce that Colleen is an organ donor, and Traci decides to give Colleen's heart to Victor Newman. On her death bed, a heartbroken J.T tells Colleen that he loves her and always will.|$|E

500|$|Early in the evening, the {{disguised}} Loki and Thor {{meet with}} Þrymr and the assembled jötnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of mead. Þrymr finds the behaviour {{at odds with}} his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before Þrymr and appearing as a [...] "very shrewd maid", makes the excuse that [...] "Freyja's" [...] behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. Þrymr then lifts [...] "Freyja's" [...] veil and wants to kiss [...] "her". Terrifying eyes stare <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> seemingly burning with fire. Loki says that this is because [...] "Freyja" [...] has not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.|$|E
500|$|According to Chris Cowley, Brady regretted Hindley's {{imprisonment}} and {{the consequences}} of their actions, but not necessarily the crimes themselves. He saw no point in making any kind of public apology; instead, he [...] "expresse remorse through actions". Twenty years of transcribing classical texts into Braille came to an end when the authorities confiscated his translation machine, for fear it might be used as a weapon. He once offered to donate one of his kidneys to [...] "someone, anyone who needed one", but was blocked from doing so. According to Colin Wilson, [...] "it was because these attempts to express remorse were thrown <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> that he began to contemplate suicide". He might have achieved this in 2006, when a female friend sent him 50paracetamol pills, stored in two Smarties tubes hidden inside a hollowed-out crime novel. The potentially lethal dose of tablets was intercepted.|$|E

500|$|At {{the dining}} room, Diane orders them {{to wait for}} dinner until the turkey is ready. As suppertime is passing, the turkey is still very undercooked and the {{trimmings}} have gone cold. Carla and Norm start blaming {{each other for the}} turkey's slow cooking. Norm throws some of Carla's peas at her, and she then throws carrots <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Cliff throws mashed yams at Frasier, who accidentally throws gravy skin back at Woody, intended for Cliff. The whole gang is poised to start a food fight until Diane stands up and tells them loudly to stop. When she is close to scolding them, Sam throws cranberry sauce at her, so the food fight resumes. By the time the food fight ends, the turkey is finally cooked. The gang calms down and decides to eat what they can. Diane comes out of the kitchen and throws a pumpkin pie to spite Sam for throwing cranberry sauce at her. The pie misses Sam but accidentally hits Vera as she enters. Vera tells Norm to fetch his coat, and Norm says, [...] "Yes, dear." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{major theme}} {{in this story}} {{is that of a}} {{symbiotic}} relationship between a planet and its inhabitants, similar to that in The Word for World Is Forest. In her introduction to the story, Le Guin stated [...] "We all have forests in our minds. Forests unexplored, unending. Each of us gets lost in the forests, every night, alone." [...] The [...] "vegetable love" [...] referred to in the poem from which the title is taken can be used to describe the final relationship between Osden and the planetary intelligence of World 4470. When Osden is attacked by Porlock in the planet, he transmits his fear to the planet, which amplifies it and reflects it <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Thus Osden's role {{is similar to that of}} Selver in The Word for World is Forest, in that he introduces violence to the forest world. The intelligence of Le Guin's forest has been contrasted to the [...] "low" [...] position occupied by vegetative beings in the works of other science fiction authors such as Arthur C. Clarke.|$|E

She screams in terror and attempts to flee. Leland chases Maddy up the stairs, and drags her to the living room. He strangles and punches her, then taunts and chases her around the living room. He corners her and punches her in the face until she is catatonic. He dances with and cries over her limp body, calling her [...] "Laura," [...] while Bob kisses her.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Illegal" [...] {{was shot in}} Mexico City on 17 October 2006, during a short break in the {{schedule}} of the Oral Fixation Tour, between concerts in Mexico and Guatemala. Jaume de Laiguana and Shakira were the co-directors of the video. The filming took a full day, and some American and Mexican fans were invited over as extras. It officially premiered on 16 November 2006 on MTV's Total Request Live (TRL). The video features Shakira as the girlfriend of a boxer. Throughout most of the video, she {{is shown in the}} empty boxing venue where her former boyfriend boxes. Through flashbacks, she remembers the good times in their relationship - including being alone in the ring, affectionately treating each other. At the end of the video, the reason behind their break-up is shown. Shakira comes to see her boyfriend boxing in the championship match where he wins, unaware that Shakira is there watching him. Another girl steps in the ring and kisses the boxer, revealing to Shakira he is cheating on her. Her boyfriend, to his shock, finally sees that Shakira is watching him kiss the other girl. The video ends with her looking <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> clearly hurt, before turning away and leaving.|$|E

She finds it difficult to handle Michael's criticism and Kevin's sexual advances, and spends {{the rest of the}} day without her glasses, reducing her productivity. [...] Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) comes to Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch, and after a talk with Toby, Ryan tells Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that he is giving him an official warning about his job performance. Ryan denies that his action is motivated by Jim's previous complaints to David Wallace, saying he thrives on constructive criticism (while Toby's comments to the documentary crew indicate he is not upset about the warning, owing to his envy of Jim's relationship with Pam). [...] Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) is selling his 2001 Nissan Xterra for $8,700, and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) pressures him into selling it for $1,500 less than the asking price, because according to Dwight, [...] " [...] car is crap". Dwight assures Andy that he will only use it as a wagon and dragged by a mule on Dwight's beet farm. Andy then sells it to Dwight, who, in a passive-aggressive method of getting <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> for dating Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), washes it and posts a sign asking for $9,995 for the vehicle, which upsets Andy when he finds Dwight's advertisement posted on the cabinet in the office kitchen. Dwight declares that it is already on Ebay which he claims is the subject of a three-way bidding war.|$|E
500|$|Casablanca Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{to be directed}} by Jake Nava, who previously worked {{in the same year}} with Britney Spears on her music video for [...] "My Prerogative" [...] (2004). The music video for [...] "Rumors" [...] premiered on October 14, 2004 and October 20, 2004 through Disney Channel and MTV. In the beginning of the video, Lohan is followed by paparazzi as she is entering her car. It is revealed that this is a Lindsay-look-alike, and that the real Lohan is entering another car to go to a club. The car comes to a stop, and she then steps into an elevator and sings the first verse of the song, while she is filmed by a CCTV camera in the elevator. The next sequence shows her running through a hallway, dressed up, before getting into the club. There, she dances in the crowd, where she takes a picture of one of the paparazzi herself to get <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> In the next sequence, she is walking slowly through the club where she finds the man who seems to be her boyfriend. She takes a seat next to her lover and they begin kissing and touching each other, all the while being constantly filmed by cameras in the club. While Lohan sings the second chorus, she is trapped in a cage {{in the middle of the}} club and the whole crowd is watching her. After this Lohan is shown dancing in the club with her friends. At the end of the music video Lohan and her friends enter the top of a high-rise and perform a dance routine while helicopters are circling around them. Finally Lohan gets into a helicopter and escapes. In the end, she throws her camera away with all the pictures taken of her.|$|E
