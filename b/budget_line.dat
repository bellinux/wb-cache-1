5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} by gaming critics on all platforms.

25|$|The {{income effect}} is a {{phenomenon}} observed through changes in purchasing power. It reveals the change in quantity demanded brought by a change in real income. The figure 1 on the left shows the consumption patterns of the consumer of two goods X1 and X2, the prices of which are p1 and p2 respectively. The initial bundle X*, is the bundle which is chosen by the consumer on the <b>budget</b> <b>line</b> B1. An increase in the money income of the consumer, with p1 and p2 constant, will shift the <b>budget</b> <b>line</b> outward parallel to itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{figure on}} the right (figure 3), shows the {{consumption}} patterns of the consumer of two goods X1 and X2, the prices of which are p1 and p2 respectively, where B1 and B2 are the budget lines and I1 and I2 are the indifference curves. Figure 3 clearly shows that, with {{a rise in the}} income of the consumer, the initial <b>budget</b> <b>line</b> B1 moves outward parallel to itself to B2 and the consumer now chooses X' bundle to the initial bundle X*. The figure shows that, the demand for X2 has risen from X21 to X22 with an outward shift of the <b>budget</b> <b>line</b> from B1 to B2 (caused due to rise in the income of the consumer). This essentially means that, good X2 is a normal good as the demand for X2 rose with an increase in the income of the consumer.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{it is to}} {{be noted}} from the figure, that the demand for X1 has fallen from X11 to X12 with an outward shift of the <b>budget</b> <b>line</b> from B1 to B2 (caused due to rise in the income of the consumer). This implies that, good X1 is an {{inferior}} good as the demand for X1 fell with an increase in the income of the consumer.|$|E

25|$|This {{recognition}} {{of the importance of}} providing financial assistance for habitat protection was taken forward in 1982 when the European Parliament succeeded in introducing a small <b>budget</b> <b>line</b> for nature conservation, enabling financing of a dozen or so projects. This funding was renewed in 1983 and provided support for small-scale, preparatory projects that nevertheless had a significant impact. In respect of the later ACE Regulations (Action Communautaire pour l'Environnement or EU Actions for the Environment), this support was known as pre-ACE.|$|E
25|$|Rendell drew some {{criticism}} following a late January 2009 preview of his budget {{proposal that would}} eliminate 100 <b>budget</b> <b>line</b> items, including {{programs such as the}} Pennsylvania Governor's Schools of Excellence and Drug Abuse Resistance Education ("D.A.R.E."). These program cuts are part of Rendell's proposal to cut state expenditures to a level 1 percent below the 2002-2003 budget in response to an expected 2.3 billion dollar budget shortfall. As a result of the budget crisis, Rendell spokesman Chuck Ardo resigned.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{manufacturers}} {{such as the}} Ives Manufacturing Company, American Flyer, and Lionel Corporation used O gauge {{for their}} <b>budget</b> <b>line,</b> marketing either Gauge 1 or 'Wide gauge' (also known as 'standard gauge') as their premium trains. One of the Lionel Corporation's most popular trains, the 203 Armoured Locomotive, was O gauge and ran on tracks with rails spaced 1.25 inches apart. The Great Depression wiped out demand for the expensive larger trains, and by 1932, O gauge was the standard, almost by default.|$|E

Ending 2009, most of the Spanish Regions (Comunidades Autónomas) had considered codevelopment and had set up <b>budget</b> <b>lines</b> both for migrants' associations and Development NGOs. Graciela Malgesini argues that codevelopment and migrants' remittances partly redirect the decentralized cooperation funds to their countries of origin.|$|R

The {{total cost of}} these projects during the lifetime of the programme (1984–1991) was ECU 98 million, with the EU providing ECU 41 million, or 44.5 {{percent of the total}} cost. In addition, a different <b>budget</b> <b>line</b> was made available from 1988 onwards for 'urgent actions for endangered species'. It was not supported by a Regulation but was included in the annual budget of the Commission by the European Parliament. In total, 50 projects were financed with assistance totalling €3 million under this budget.|$|E
25|$|Between 2003 and 2007, the EU {{committed}} round €33 {{million to}} the Water Supply Programme to Regional Centres, jointly financed by German financial cooperation. The main objective of the programme was to improve the access to sustainable quality water supply and wastewater management services in the three regional centres of Mwanza, Iringa and Mbeya. Further funds of about €6.6 million were provided for the Mwanza Sewerage Rehabilitation Project between 2000 and 2004, whose aim was to prevent the overflow of raw sewage from Mwanza to Lake Victoria. Rural water and sanitation is supported through the EU general <b>budget</b> <b>line</b> for co-financing NGOs in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|A {{company called}} American Model Toys {{brought out a}} line of realistic, {{detailed}} cars beginning in 1948. In 1953 it released a <b>budget</b> <b>line.</b> It ran into financial difficulty, reorganized under the name Auburn Model Trains, and ended up selling its line to Nashville, Tennessee-based Kusan, a plastics company who continued its production until 1961. The tooling was then sold to a small company run by Andrew (Andy) Kriswalus in Endicott, New York, who operated as Kris Model Trains, or KMT. Andy Kriswalus only produced the box, stock, and refrigerator cars from the Kusan dies, and {{on some of these}} cars he mounted die-cast trucks from the Kusan tooling. After Kriswalus' death, the tooling was sold to K-Line and Williams Electric Trains, who continued to use it to produce parts of their budget lines.|$|E
