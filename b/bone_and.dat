5|$|OCD {{is caused}} by blood {{deprivation}} in the subchondral bone. This loss of blood flow causes the subchondral bone {{to die in a}} process called avascular necrosis. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the articular cartilage it supported prone to damage. The result is fragmentation (dissection) of both cartilage and <b>bone,</b> <b>and</b> the free movement of these <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> cartilage fragments within the joint space, causing pain and further damage. OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.|$|E

Samples of inscriptions on oracle <b>bones</b> <b>and</b> cuneiform were taken into computer images.

5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E

5|$|On the ground, the Australian magpie {{moves around}} by walking, {{and is the}} only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel.

5|$|Other {{distinctive}} features are a relatively long, level croup, or {{top of the}} hindquarters, and naturally high tail carriage. The USEF breed standard requires Arabians have solid <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> standard correct equine conformation. Well-bred Arabians have a deep, well-angled hip and well laid-back shoulder. Within the breed, there are variations. Some individuals have wider, more powerfully muscled hindquarters suitable for intense bursts of activity in events such as reining, while others have longer, leaner muscling better suited for long stretches of flat work such as endurance riding or horse racing. Most have a compact body with a short back. Arabians usually have dense, strong <b>bone,</b> <b>and</b> good hoof walls. They are especially noted for their endurance, and {{the superiority of the}} breed in Endurance riding competition demonstrates that well-bred Arabians are strong, sound horses with superior stamina. At international FEI-sponsored endurance events, Arabians and half-Arabians are the dominant performers in distance competition.|$|E

The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best {{is based on an}} assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3mm loss), moderate (4–6mm loss) or severe (greater than 6mm loss). Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation.|$|E

40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Bone remodeling, the fundamental process for bone renewal, is targeted by treatments of osteoporosis {{to correct the}} imbalance between <b>bone</b> resorption <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> formation <b>and</b> {{reduce the risk of}} fractures and associated clinical consequences. Currently available therapeutics affect <b>bone</b> resorption <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> formation in the same direction and either decrease (inhibitors of bone resorption) or increase (parathyroid hormone [PTH] peptides) bone remodeling. Studies of patients with rare <b>bone</b> diseases <b>and</b> genetically modified animal models demonstrated that <b>bone</b> resorption <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> formation may not necessarily be coupled, leading to identification of molecular targets in bone cells for the development of novel agents for the treatment of osteoporosis. Application of such agents to the treatment of women with low bone mass confirmed that <b>bone</b> resorption <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> formation can be modulated in different directions and so far two new classes of thera-peutics for osteoporosis have been defined with distinct mechanisms of action. Such treatments, if combined with a favorable safety profile, will offer new therapeutic options and will improve the management of patients with osteoporosis. Key Points In osteoporosis, there is an imbalance between <b>bone</b> resorption <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> formation leading to <b>bone</b> loss <b>and</b> structural decay of the skeleton. Currently available therapeutics affect <b>bone</b> resorption <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> formation in the same direction and either decrease (inhibitors of bone resorption) or increase (PTH peptides) bone remodeling. New classes of therapeutics for osteoporosis with different mechanisms of action are in clinical development. Inhibitors of Cathepsin K reduce bone resorption while preserving <b>bone</b> formation <b>and</b> increase <b>bone</b> mineral density at the spine and the hip continuously for at least 5 years of treatment. Inhibitors of sclerostin increase bone formation while reducing <b>bone</b> resorption <b>and</b> impressively increase <b>bone</b> mineral density at the spine and the hip. ...|$|R
