The Hawaiians saw Capella {{as part of an}} {{asterism}} Ke ka o Makali'i ("The canoe <b>bailer</b> of Makali'i") that helped them navigate at sea. Called Hoku-lei [...] "star wreath", it formed this asterism with Procyon, Sirius, Castor and Pollux. In Tahitian folklore, Capella was Tahi-ari'i, the wife of Fa'a-nui (Auriga) and mother of prince Ta'urua (Venus) who sails his canoe across the sky. In Inuit astronomy, Capella, along with Menkalinan (Beta Aurigae), Pollux (Beta Geminorum) and Castor (Alpha Geminorum), formed a constellation Quturjuuk, [...] "collar-bones", the two pairs of stars denoting a bone each. Used for navigation and time-keeping at night, the constellation was recognised from Alaska to western Greenland. The Gwich'in saw Capella and Menkalinan has forming shreets'ą įį vidzee, the right ear of the large circumpolar constellation Yahdii, which covered much of the night sky, and whose orientation facilitated navigation and timekeeping.|$|E

50|$|There are {{advantages}} and disadvantages to using <b>bailers</b> for groundwater sampling. <b>Bailers</b> are simple devices to use and are relatively inexpensive. Disposable <b>bailers</b> are usually cleaned to United States Environmental Protection Agency specifications and individually packaged to protect sample integrity. In addition, <b>bailers</b> can be lowered to any depth while pumps have sharp limitations on {{the depth of the}} well. The main drawback of using <b>bailers</b> is aeration of the water as the sample is obtained, which could release volatile organic compounds that need to be tested. Also, if there is a high amount of sediment or turbidity, this may interfere with the ball check valve seating correctly.|$|R

The boat also has good performance, making it suitable for racing by more experienced crews. The Buzz has proven itself to be easy to right after capsizing, and it is straightforward to re-board the boat from the water, partly due to its low centre of buoyancy and self draining cockpit with its open transom. The open transom also means that the boat drains quickly on righting doing away with the need for self <b>bailers.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract The alvinocaridid shrimp Rimicaris exoculata is an {{abundant}} {{component of the}} biota of Mid-Atlantic Ridge hydrothermal vents. To determine the nutritional strategy of this organism, we analysed the molecular abundance and carbon isotopic composition of its phospholipid fatty acids. High abundances of n- 7 fatty acids (> 40 % total fatty acids) were observed in R. ex-oculata muscle tissues, in bacterial epibionts scraped from its gill <b>bailers,</b> and from the bacterially infested metal sulphides that the shrimp ingest. The phospholipid fatty acid abundance data indicates that the bacteria in the sulphides {{are closely related to}} the bacterial epibiota inhabiting the shrimp gill <b>bailers,</b> carapace and other body parts. Compound specific d 13 C analyses of the phospholipid fatty acids gave average values of) 12 & for the epibiont bacteria and) 21 & for the sulphide bacteria. This dierence may be largely due to the ex-pression of dierent forms of RuBisCO (Forms I and II) which fractionate against 13 C to dierent extents. Car-bon limitation within the shrimp epibiont population may be an additional factor. The d 13 C values (mean) 13 &) of the saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids isolated from the muscle tissues of R. ex-oculata were very close to those of the epibionts, indi-cating that the predominant source of dietary carbon for the shrimp is their epibionts, with a lesser contribution from free-living bacteria. The d 13 C values () 26 &) of shrimp cholesterol were much more negative than those of the fatty acids, and this cholesterol is likely to have derived from the oceanic photic zone...|$|R

Development initiatives working to achieve improved drinking water access often introduce appropriate technologies designed to be sustainably {{owned and operated by}} populations in rural areas suffering from water related hardships. It is valuable to thoroughly examine the degree to which these technologies satisfy intended objectives and affect user experienced water access. The accurate reflection of impact and progress can be complex, as the evaluation of water supplies can be made based on a variety of indicators that range from 2 ̆ 2 improved 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 2 unimproved 2 ̆ 2 water source definitions to measurements of the capacity of a source to satisfy desirable conditions related to water quality, quantity, reliability, or user 2 ̆ 7 s preference. The goals of this research are to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the effects of two appropriate technologies on local water access using an assortment of methods including: water quality analysis, visual and manual inspection, user interviews, and an overall sustainability analysis. In Panama, the indigenous Ng[oumlaut]be people in the [Ntilde][oumlaut]Kribo coastal area are a group disproportionately affected by a lack of improved access to drinking water and challenges to the feasibility of piped gravity fed water systems that typically serve the rest of the country.

Eco literacy of customers were high depends on market type and market is still in a premature stage in going green. Farmers were selected from two, out of nine districts where cinnamon is cultivated in Sri Lanka. Limited numbers of laboratory tests were carried out due to limited laboratory facilities available. Shop visits and customer selection was based on Colombo area only. In the interest of developing industry of cinnamon wood product, improving quality of wood process was suggested.

The farmers quoted in this briefing can be heard in the radio documentary and full transcripts of their interviews are also available. The Oxfordshire farmers were interviewed in May and June 2002. The farming crisis There is a global crisis in farming, caused primarily by the collapse in the price that farmers receive for their produce. This crisis has sent shock waves through the UK farming industry as farming undergoes what has been described as the most fundamental restructuring since the Corn Laws. Whilst the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 has forced many livestock farmers, including Oxfordshire pig farmer David Orpwood, to leave farming, foot and mouth disease is in reality only {{the latest in a series}} of UK specific factors (including food safety scares, such as BSE, and the strong pound), which have exacerbated the impact of the global crisis in farming. “Foot and mouth cost me last year, on my budgeted income it cost me, £ 75, 600 last year. …. It's done enormous damage to agriculture in this country, and it was the final straw, I couldn't see myself (how) to break out of, what I saw was a spiral down of my net worth. ” 1 David Orpwood, farmer The declining farm workforce: losing small and family farmers at an alarming rate The number of people working in agriculture has consistently been in decline for the past fifty years. In 1949 there were aproximately 570, 000 farmers and farm workers in England and Wales, by 2001 there were 430, 000. 2 In part this loss of labour from the land has been due to the post war industrialisation of farming and the replacement of farm labour by machinery. “Now with the big high-density <b>bailers,</b> like last year I saw the guys go-in, they'd bailed and cleared the whole farm in three days, and that was one man, whereas when we were doing it, we'd have been like me bailing, three guys pitching and loading bails and another couple stacking them back in the barn. And so five men working for thirty days, that's one hundred and fifty men days replaced by three days. It's just incredible; I mean its (a) fundamental difference. ”...|$|R
