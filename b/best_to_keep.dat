5|$|All {{the while}} Hancock was posted in New York, {{he did his}} <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his {{political}} ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' 1876 convention, but was never a serious contender as New York governor Samuel J. Tilden swept the field on the second ballot. The Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The electoral crisis of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel F. O. Chilton's 2/2nd Infantry Battalion {{found that}} it was <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> skirmishing forward {{throughout}} this advance, because going to ground {{for any length of time}} meant sitting in the middle of the enemy artillery concentrations that inflicted further casualties. The Australian troops made good progress, six tank crossings were readied and mines between them and the wire had been detected. Five minutes later, the 23 Matildas of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment advanced, accompanied by the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion. Passing through the gaps, they swung right along the double line of posts.|$|E

While the staff try their <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their jobs, Liz struggles with making a {{decision}} of whom to fire. Liz's problem is solved when Floyd, for whom Liz has romantic feelings, tells her that his girlfriend works in accounting at TGS. After Liz fires Floyd's girlfriend, she goes on a rampage around 30 Rock firing people, including her producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), who disagrees with her decision to fire Floyd's girlfriend for her own personal gain. Jack later tells her that he hired all the fired people back, but he is transferring Floyd's girlfriend to General Electric headquarters in Fairfield, Connecticut.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to London briefly in mid-1939, the couple returned to America, Leigh to film the final takes for Gone with the Wind, and Olivier {{to prepare for}} filming of Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca—although the couple had hoped to appear in it together. Instead, Joan Fontaine was selected {{for the role of}} Mrs de Winter, as the producer David O. Selznick thought that not only was she more suitable for the role, but that it was <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Olivier and Leigh apart until their divorces came through. Olivier followed Rebecca with Pride and Prejudice, in the role of Mr. Darcy. To his disappointment Elizabeth Bennet was played by Greer Garson rather than Leigh. He received good reviews for both films and showed a more confident screen presence than he had in his early work. In January 1940 Olivier and Esmond were granted their divorce. In February, following another request from Leigh, her husband also applied for their marriage to be terminated.|$|E

Even as he fell he tried to use the opportunity to persuade both camps to put an end to the war. Bhishma was a complete human, a complete warrior and a complete teacher (acharya), hence he was known as Bhishmacharya.|$|E

25|$|An accumulator, Butt {{works hard}} for his runs, not indulging {{in too many}} big hits; his {{statistics}} show the low number of 19 international sixes to date (1 September 2010) of which he's scored 10 in Twenty20 cricket, 7 in One-Day Internationals and only six in Test cricket. He scores {{a lot of his}} runs between backward point and extra cover. He uses his superb wrist work to angle the bat, placing the ball into gaps using the pace of the ball to his advantage; a very good technique for ODIs where it is <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the scoreboard ticking all the time. He also has the ability to cut the ball very fine down to third man if there are no slips, especially against spin bowlers, as he showed to great effect in his above-mentioned innings of 108 not out. These are his specialties, but he has large range of shots. However, many commentators have expressed that his defensive technique has flaws, and that he is prone to playing at balls outside off-stump which should be left.|$|E
