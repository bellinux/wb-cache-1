5000|$|The toys {{were small}} plastic {{characters}} with fabric clothing and synthetic yarn hair, all in fantastic, garishly bright colors. Each {{came with a}} fold-out cardboard Playland mat, a [...] "Magic Bridge Clip" [...] to link one mat to another, some wild (and often quite fragile!) accessories, a mode of transportation, and a name that summed up their character in a few nonsensical words. All of the individual Playland mats were designed to be placed together using the Bridge Clips to make the [...] "Happidiculous World" [...] of The Upsys and Downsys. The Upsy figures were approximately 2-1/2" [...] tall, basically humanoid in shape, with tiny bodies and huge oversized heads topped with a large <b>bright</b> <b>yarn</b> pompom for hair. The Downsys, on the other hand, were more cartoonish beings, about 4" [...] in height with wild, goofy faces {{in the middle of}} a large, rounded body. Downsys' hands are positioned on the tops of their heads, to allow them to stand upside-down.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} the color difference, whiteness, and luster of multifilament polyester woven fabrics based on weave pattern, weft density, dye concentration, and interaction between super bright warp yarns and semi dull weft yarns. Plain, weft rib (2 / 2), sateen (1 / 4) (3) and steep twill(2 / 3) {{was selected as}} weave pattern. Warp yarn type and its count, and warp density were kept constant. Measurement of whiteness was conducted on pre-treated un-dyed fabric samples. Color difference and luster of samples was evaluated after dying in warp and weft direction separately. Plain and weft rib (2 / 2) weaves showed the lowest and highest value of whiteness and luster respectively. Interaction between weave pattern and application of super <b>bright</b> <b>yarn</b> as warp was obtained in these parameters. The luster and whiteness of samples was decreased by increase in weft density. The trend of luster and color difference in weft and warp direction by increasing the weft density was not similar and was dependent on dye concentration and effectiveness of super bright warp yarns according to fabric pattern. Woven fabrics with steep twill (2 / 3) and weft rib (2 / 2) revealed the highest values of color difference compared with plain and sateen (1 / 4) (3) in warp direction. In weft direction, plain weave showed the lowest value of color difference and all three others had almost {{the same level of}} color difference. Moreover, the visual assessment was organized based on twenty-two observers in standard condition and D 65 light source...|$|E

5000|$|When {{the film}} was {{released}} The New York Times wrote: If proof be needed {{at this point that}} money is the root of all evil—a theme, incidentally, which has been the root of more than one motion picture—then Too Late for Tears, which came to the Mayfair on Saturday, is proof positive. For producer Hunt Stromberg, director Byron Haskin and scenarist Roy Huggins, who adapted his own Saturday Evening Post serial, herein have fashioned an effective melodramatic elaboration of that theme. Despite an involved plot and an occasional overabundance of palaver, not all of which is <b>bright,</b> this <b>yarn</b> about a cash-hungry dame who doesn't let men or conscience stand in her way, is an adult and generally suspenseful adventure.|$|R
40|$|Small {{fragment}} of yellowed woven wool fabric with a ribbed selvedge along one edge. Part of the torn fragment has been folded on {{itself and the}} warps are at right angles in this area. <b>Yarns,</b> including a <b>bright</b> red wool <b>yarn,</b> have adhered to the surface.; Very dirty and worn. There is one small interior hole {{and there are a}} few pinholes. There are large edge tears which almost separate the selvedge from the fabric. Small amount of edge fraying...|$|R
