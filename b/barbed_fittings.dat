5000|$|PBT - {{flexible}} (usually gray or black) {{plastic pipe}} which {{is attached to}} <b>barbed</b> <b>fittings</b> and secured in place with a copper crimp ring. The primary manufacturer of PBT tubing and fittings was driven into bankruptcy by a class-action lawsuit over failures of this system. However, PB and PBT tubing has since returned to the market and codes, typically first for [...] "exposed locations" [...] such as risers.|$|E
2500|$|Tubing {{should be}} cut from a barbed {{connection}} {{so as not to}} shatter the connection. [...] A quick disconnect is preferable to a <b>barbed</b> <b>fitting.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2010, a Focus SVT {{owner in}} Minnesota {{identified}} a fix for the housing issue. It {{involves the use}} of a more durable housing made for an earlier model of Zetecs. The lighter housing (still specified by Ford Parts) has not been corrected for the design flaw. It has a short service life and is the cause of repeated failures. As of September 2013, Ford sells both versions of the housing. The better version lists for $20 more (USA) and has <b>barbed</b> hose <b>fittings,</b> as opposed to the smooth fittings of the problematic fitting. Fixes have been identified for the housing used by the Focus SVT {{as well as for the}} simpler housing used by ordinary Foci.|$|R
50|$|A barb (or hose barb), which connects {{flexible}} hose or tubing to pipes, typically has a male-threaded end which mates with female threads. The {{other end of}} the fitting has a single- or multi-barbed tubeâ€”a long tapered cone with ridges, which is inserted into a {{flexible hose}}. An adjustable worm drive screw clamp (or other type of clamp) is often added, to keep the hose from slipping off the <b>barbed</b> tube. Barb <b>fittings</b> can be made of brass for hot-water applications, and plastic may be used for cold water; brass is considered more durable for heavy-duty use. The barb fitting may be elbow-shaped or straight.|$|R
40|$|Soft Robotic ActuatorsByJuleon Taylor GodfreyMaster of Science in Mechanical and Aerospace EngineeringUniversity of California, Irvine, 2017 Dean Gregory N. Washington Irvine, ChairIn {{this thesis}} a survey on soft robotic {{actuators}} is conducted. The actuators are classified into three main categories: Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAM), Electronic Electroactive Polymers (Electric EAP), and Ionic Electroactive Polymers (Ionic EAP). Soft robots can have many degrees {{and are more}} compliant than hard robots. This makes them suitable for applications that are difficult for hard robots. For each actuator background history, build materials, how they operate, and modeling are presented. Multiple actuators in each class are reviewed highlighting both their use and their mathematical formulation. In addition to the survey the McKibben actuator was chosen for fabrication and in-depth experimental analysis. Four McKibben actuators were fabricated using mesh sleeve, <b>barbed</b> hose <b>fittings,</b> and different elastic bladders. All were actuated using compressed air. Tensile tests were performed for each actuator to measure the tension force as air pressure increased from 20 to 100 psi in 10 psi increments. To account for material relaxation properties eleven trials for each actuator were run for 2 - 3 days. In conclusion, the smallest outer diameter elastic bladder was capable of producing the highest force due to the larger gap between the bladder and the sleeve...|$|R
