25|$|In {{recent years}} prior to 2011, the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Bay</b> and the Bothnian Sea were frozen with solid ice near the Baltic coast and dense {{floating}} ice far from it. In 2008, {{there was almost no}} ice formation except for a short period in March.|$|E
25|$|Pusa hispida botnica (validity questionable): The Baltic Sea, {{especially}} in the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Bay</b> {{where there is a}} large population, but there are also endangered populations in the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga and the Archipelago Sea.

25|$|Freezing {{begins in}} the {{northern}} extremities of Gulf of Bothnia typically {{in the middle of}} November, reaching the open waters of the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Bay</b> in early January. The Bothnian Sea, the basin south of Kvarken, freezes on average in late February. The Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga freeze typically in late January. In 2011, the Gulf of Finland was completely frozen on 15 February.|$|E
40|$|The {{peculiar}} bio-optical {{properties of}} the northernmost waters of the Baltic Sea (<b>Bothnian</b> Sea and <b>Bay</b> of Bothnia) are illustrated by exploiting unique in situ measurements of apparent and inherent optical properties collected in 2007. Specifically, this study shows that the high values of absorption by colored dissolved organic matter (ays(412) around 1. 4 m^- 1) resulting from the presence of humic matter brought by the numerous Swedish and Finnish rivers alimenting the basin are not correlated with high concentrations of particles as generally observed in the southern Baltic Sea. As a consequence, extremely low values (i. e., less than 0. 5) of the ratio of scattering to absorption are observed in the blue spectral region. The corresponding spectra of normalized water leaving radiance are close to satisfy the ¿black pixel¿ assumption in the blue {{and even in the}} green part of the visible spectrum. Consequently, the Bothnian Sea and most of all the Bay of Bothnia, appear ideal candidates for studies on atmospheric corrections and vicarious calibration of ocean color sensors in coastal waters.

40|$|The Helgoland mud {{area was}} {{characterized}} by high sedimentation rates prior to 1250 AD, most likely {{accounted for by the}} disintegration of the Helgoland Island during this period. Presumably, high amounts of terrigenous metals (e. g. Fe and Mn minerals) and organic matter were deposited {{as a result of the}} high sedimentation rates. Evident from the deposition of high amounts of organic matter and metals in the past are the shallow sulfate-methane transition zone (due to rapid organic matter-dependent electron acceptor consumption) and elevated concentrations of dissolved metals (Fe and Mn) in the methanic zone of the Helgoland mud area. Such high concentrations of dissolved Fe and Mn have been observed in other highly-depositional environments (e. g. Argentine Basin, <b>Bothnian</b> Sea, Aarhus <b>Bay</b> etc.). However, whether biotic or abiotic, the source of elevated dissolved iron in the methanic zone is still not known. Amid several hypotheses, the exact mechanisms of iron reduction in methanic zones of marine sediments are also still a matter of debate. Therefore, as a first step to understanding the potential involvement of microorganisms in iron reduction in the methanic zone in marine sediments, this work provides a 16 S rRNA gene-based characterization and quantification of bacteria and archaea populations in the surface and subsurface sediments of the Helgoland mud area. In addition, this work links iron reduction in the methanic zone of the Helgoland mud area to biotic activities and suggested microbial populations which may have been involved in iron cycling therein. High and depth-wisely increasing concentrations of NH 4 in pore-water measurements from subsurface sediments of many highly-depositional environments around the world suggest that organic matter degradation is still ongoing in deeper sediments. Nevertheless, molecular information about the composition and diagenetic changes of organic matter from surface to subsurface sediments are few. On this front, this doctoral work shows that the most dominant bacteria and archaea populations in the subsurface sediments of the Helgoland mud area are influenced by concentration of organic matter, thus potentially important for organic matter degradation therein. Molecular characterization of a potentially bio-available portion of sedimentary organic matter (the water-extractable fraction) in the surface and subsurface sediments, using Fourier Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry, most 7 importantly reveals that while aliphatic, N-rich compounds, presumably of algal origin are preferentially degraded in the surface sediments, O-rich, aromatic compounds, most likely of terrestrial origin are utilized in deeper sediments. These results are consistent with observations in subsurface soils of peatlands suggesting similar diagenetic alterations of organic matter in marine subsurface sediments. It is a three decade-old finding that when poorly-crystalline Mn (IV) is added to marine sediments, there is a rapid formation of sulfate which is linked to biological activity. However, knowledge of the diversity of microorganisms involved in this reaction is limited. In experiments investigating the potential for chemolithotrophic Mn (IV) reduction in subsurface sediments of the Helgoland mud area, this work uncovers novel uncultured Deltaproteobacteria (tentatively named Marine Sediment Manganese-reducing Enrichment, MSME Cluster) potentially involved Mn (IV) -dependent sulfate formation in marine sediments. Overall, this work adds to the current body of knowledge on microbe-mineral or geo-microbiological interactions in marine sediments. The finding that hematite enhanced methanogenesis (by 25 â 48 % faster) in a year-long slurry incubations with sediments from the subsurface sediment of the Helgoland mud area also provide a basis for future studies on how (semi) conductive iron minerals such as hematite, goethite, and pyrite may mediate electron transfer between specific bacterial populations and methanogens in the Helgoland mud area...|$|R
25|$|The Finnish Board of Navigation {{decommissioned}} Sisu, now {{the oldest}} and smallest icebreaker in the state-owned fleet, in 1974. At the time, Finland had a fleet of nine diesel-electric icebreakers in service and two more under construction. The new icebreakers, which had nearly five times the displacement and {{more than five times}} the power of the old Sisu, were designed to guarantee year-round traffic to all Finnish ports in the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Bay.</b> The second of these icebreakers was named Sisu in 1975.|$|E
25|$|While the {{economic}} growth stagnated in Finland in the early 1930s following the Great Depression, international trade began to recover relatively soon {{and in particular the}} export of forest products from the ports in the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Bay</b> was growing. Already in 1932, a delegation from Northern Ostrobothnia submitted a proposal {{for the construction of a}} new state-owned icebreaker. In 1935, another large delegation of politicians and representatives from coastal cities proposed expanding the state-owned icebreaker fleet. They were also strongly supported by the growing Finnish forest industry.|$|E
25|$|In spring, the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia {{normally}} thaw in late April, {{with some}} ice ridges persisting until May {{in the eastern}} extremities of the Gulf of Finland. In the northernmost reaches of the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Bay,</b> ice usually stays until late May; by early June it is practically always gone. However, in the famine year of 1867 remnants of ice were observed as late as July 17 near Uddskär. Even {{as far south as}} Øresund, remnants of ice have been observed in May; near Taarbaek on May 15, 1942 and near Copenhagen on May 11, 1771.|$|E
25|$|In May 1908, Tarmo {{was sent}} {{for the first}} time to the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Bay</b> to open the harbors and fairways for the spring. On 2 June, she was run hard aground near Raahe due to an error by a pilot when {{navigating}} by sight, resulting in extensive damage to the bottom plating and a lost propeller blade. Kept afloat by her own pumps, she returned to Raahe for emergency repairs and continued to Helsinki, where she was drydocked from 7 June until early August. In 1912 she was again run aground near Hanko, but the damage was not as extensive as on the first time.|$|E
25|$|Sweden's westernmost {{point is}} on Stora Drammen, an islet in Skagerrak outside {{the coast of}} Bohuslän. Seabirds and harbor seals have colonies on the islet, but it is {{uninhabited}} by humans. Sweden's easternmost point is on Kataja, an islet south of Haparanda in the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Bay.</b> The islet is divided between Sweden and Finland. The border was established in 1809, after the Finnish War, between what was previously two islets, a Swedish one called Kataja and a smaller Finnish one called Inakari. Since 1809, post-glacial rebound has caused the sea level {{in the region to}} drop relative to land level, joining the two islets. If counting the mainland only, Stensvik in Strömstad is Sweden's westernmost point, and Sundholmen in Haparanda is the easternmost point.|$|E
25|$|The armstice between Russia and Germany lapsed on 18 February 1918 and the Operation Faustschlag {{was soon}} {{launched}} by the Germans. This included the invasion of Åland, as the Germans {{did not know whether}} Sweden would remain neutral or join the Allies. The Germans had their interests in Finland because of the access to the Arctic Sea and the country's presence near the Murmansk railway and the Bolshevik capital of Saint Petersburg. To justify the invasion, Germany ordered a request of military assistance from their allies in Finland. The White Senate message requesting the German invasion of Åland reached Berlin on 22 February. The German intention was to gather troops to Åland and then land the Finnish mainland in the west coast town of Rauma. As the ice in the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Bay</b> was too thick, the landing was finally made in Hanko, Southern Finland, by the Baltic Sea Division in the first days of April.|$|E
2500|$|A {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} the fauna is that it contains a number of glacial relict species, isolated populations of arctic species which have remained in the Baltic Sea since the last glaciation, such as the large isopod Saduria entomon, the Baltic subspecies of ringed seal, and the fourhorn sculpin. Some of these relicts are derived from glacial lakes, such as [...] Monoporeia affinis, which is a main element in the benthic fauna of the low-salinity <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Bay.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{northern}} part of the Baltic Sea is known as the Gulf of Bothnia, of which the northernmost part is the Bay of Bothnia [...] or <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Bay.</b> The more rounded southern basin of the gulf is called Bothnian Sea and immediately to the south of it lies the Sea of Åland. The Gulf of Finland connects the Baltic Sea with Saint Petersburg. The Gulf of Riga lies between the Latvian capital city of Riga and the Estonian island of Saaremaa.|$|E
2500|$|Finland {{is officially}} bilingual, with Finnish and Swedish having mostly the same status at {{national}} level. [...] Finland's majority population are Finns, whose mother tongue is either Finnish (approximately 95%), Swedish or both; the Swedish speaking minority lives {{mainly on the}} coast {{from the city of}} Porvoo, in the Gulf of Finland, to the city of Kokkola, up in the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Bay.</b> The Åland Islands, an autonomous province of Finland, situated in the Baltic Sea between Finland and Sweden, is entirely Swedish speaking. Children are taught the other official language at school; for Swedish-speakers, this is Finnish (usually from the 3rd grade), and for Finnish-speakers, Swedish (usually from the 3rd, 5th or 7th grade).|$|E
2500|$|On the {{long-term}} average, the Baltic Sea is ice-covered {{at the annual}} maximum for about 45% of its surface area. The ice-covered area during such a typical winter includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, the archipelago west of Estonia, the Stockholm archipelago, and the Archipelago Sea southwest of Finland. The remainder of the Baltic does not freeze during a normal winter, {{with the exception of}} sheltered bays and shallow lagoons such as the Curonian Lagoon. The ice reaches its maximum extent in February or March; typical ice thickness in the northernmost areas in the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Bay,</b> the northern basin of the Gulf of Bothnia, is about [...] for landfast sea ice. The thickness decreases farther south.|$|E
2500|$|During {{extensive}} ice {{trials in}} the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Bay</b> in March 1986, Otso was put {{through a series}} of test to determine her icebreaking capability.
