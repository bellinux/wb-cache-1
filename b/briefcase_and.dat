50|$|The {{currency}} of the amounts {{on the money}} board, on the <b>briefcases,</b> <b>and</b> offered by the Banker to the contestants is in Philippine pesos. Throughout the show, the peso sign is never used {{in all of the}} amounts on the money board, on the <b>briefcases,</b> <b>and</b> offers by the Banker to the contestants. It is because of the limited font and/or character support for the actual peso sign (₱).|$|R

Hogan and Beefcake {{challenged}} Money Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania IX. During the match, the referee sustained a kayfabe injury and was knocked unconscious. Hart jumped into the ring, turned his jacket inside-out to reveal black and white stripes similar to a referee's shirt, and made the three-count to give the match to The Mega-Maniacs. Hogan, Beefcake, and Hart celebrated by opening Schyster's <b>briefcase</b> <b>and</b> throwing his money into the crowd. A second referee then appeared, and the Mega-Maniacs were disqualified because Hogan had used Beefcake's steel face protector as a weapon.|$|E

5|$|Violet {{explains}} to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie {{will be coming}} {{to pick up the}} money from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle of Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let Corky in, who will steal the money from a <b>briefcase</b> <b>and</b> leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino was not with him. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.|$|E

5|$|After Parry-Jones's death Scott lived {{quietly for}} a while in the West Country. In January 1974 he met Tim Keigwin, Thorpe's Conservative {{opponent}} in North Devon, and gave his version of his relationship with Thorpe. Keigwin was advised by the Conservative leadership that the material should not be used. Scott also confided in his doctor, Ronald Gleadle, who was treating him for depression. He had shown Gleadle his dossier of documents; the doctor, without Scott's knowledge or consent, sold the papers to Holmes, who had assumed the role of Thorpe's protector after Bessell settled permanently in California in January 1974. Holmes paid £2,500 for the documents, which were promptly burned in the home of Thorpe's solicitor. A further cache of papers was discovered in November 1974, by builders renovating a London office formerly used by Bessell. They found a briefcase containing letters and photographs that apparently compromised Thorpe, among them Scott's 1965 letter to Ursula Thorpe. Undecided what to do with their find, they took it to the Sunday Mirror newspaper. Sidney Jacobson, the paper's deputy chairman, decided not to publish the material and passed the <b>briefcase</b> <b>and</b> its content to Thorpe. Copies of the documents were, however, kept in the newspaper's files.|$|E
5|$|Orton {{defeated}} Sheamus, Wade Barrett, John Cena, Edge and Chris Jericho in {{a six-pack}} challenge elimination match to become WWE Champion {{for the sixth}} time at Night of Champions. After successfully defending the title against Sheamus at Hell in a Cell, Orton feuded with Wade Barrett, who was blackmailing Cena to help him capture the title. Orton lost to Barrett via disqualification at Bragging Rights, but retained the title. He defeated Barrett in a rematch at Survivor Series after Cena, who was the special guest referee, turned on Barrett. After one final match on the November 22 episode of Raw, The Miz immediately cashed in his Money in the Bank <b>briefcase</b> <b>and</b> quickly beat Orton to win the title. Orton received his rematch against The Miz in a tables match at , but lost after repeated interference from The Miz's protegé Alex Riley. On the January 3, 2011 episode of Raw, Orton defeated Sheamus and Wade Barrett in a steel cage match to earn another title match against The Miz at the Royal Rumble, but lost again at the event after The New Nexus interfered, starting a feud between Orton and New Nexus leader CM Punk.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{held the}} first-ever Feast or Fired match next. In the Feast or Fired match, four {{briefcases}} are held above four different turnbuckles on poles, with three having future title shots for the TNA World Heavyweight, TNA X Division, and TNA World Tag Team Championships; the remaining briefcase holds a pink slip, leading to that wrestler's contract termination. A wrestler must retrieve the <b>briefcase</b> <b>and</b> then leave the ring {{in order to}} gain official possession of the case. The participants in the bout were Scott Steiner, Senshi, B.G. James, Petey Williams, Shark Boy, Lance Hoyt, Christopher Daniels, Elix Skipper, Homicide, Hernandez, Kip James, Jimmy Rave, Chris Harris, and Sonjay Dutt. The contest lasted eleven minutes and fifty-five seconds. Christy Hemme accompanied Rave and Hoyt to the ring for the contest. Williams was the first to obtain a case in the match. Kip was the second; however he threw it to his Voodoo Kin Mafia tag team partner B.G. James who was standing at ringside, thus giving B.G. James possession of the case. A short time later, Senshi retrieved the third case. The final case was collected by Steiner, after he took it from Kip, who had taken it from the retriever Daniels.|$|E

5|$|The third {{multiplayer}} mode is the Combat Simulator, involving {{up to four}} human {{players and}} eight computer-controlled players. Again, a split-screen is used if more than one human is playing. If three or four humans play, the screen is divided into quarters, with one quarter left blank if necessary. Players enter the game unarmed and {{with a certain amount}} of health. Weapons and ammunition are placed around the level in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are regenerated elsewhere in the level, once again unarmed. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode, where players score points by killing their respective enemies, to objective-based games, such as Capture the Flag or King of the Hill. Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase, where players must take a <b>briefcase</b> <b>and</b> survive with it for as long as possible, and Hacker Central, a gametype where players score points by hacking a computer system using a data uplink. Aspects of each game can be customised, including the chosen map, the weapons available, and the winning conditions. Players can also be grouped into teams or compete individually. In a team game, the players can optionally be shown coloured according to their team. Each game can be customised to a greater degree than was possible in GoldenEye 007s multiplayer mode, such as free weapons selection and placement of shields.|$|E
25|$|In December 2015, veteran movie poster painter Ang Hao Sai {{launched}} his exhibition The Art of Singapore, featuring multiple paintings of Lee. In the same month, Phua San San released the children's book What's Inside The Red Box?, inspired by Lee's famous <b>briefcase</b> <b>and</b> published by Straits Times Press. A Chinese {{version of the}} best-selling book was published in March 2016, when a reading session led by Minister of State Sam Tan was held to commemorate {{the first anniversary of}} Mr Lee's death at a PAP Community Foundation Sparkletots Preschool, whose branches received over 700 sponsored copies of the book.|$|E
25|$|In March 1999, Manser {{successfully}} passed Kuching immigration by disguising {{himself in}} a business suit, carrying a <b>briefcase,</b> <b>and</b> wearing a badly knotted tie. On 29 March 1999, he flew a motorised paraglider, carrying a toy lamb knitted by himself while wearing a T-shirt {{with the image of}} a sheep and made a few turns above Taib's residence in Kuching, Sarawak. There were 10 Penan tribe members waiting on the ground to greet Manser. At 11:30 AM, he landed the glider beside a road just outside Taib's residence and was immediately arrested. He was then transported to Kuala Lumpur on Malaysia Airlines flight MH 2683. He briefly stayed at a prison in Kuala Lumpur. He was seen playing with his knitted toy lamb by his jailers. He was later deported back to Switzerland.|$|E

However, gold is included primarily as a microtransaction and advertising element - the player can buy gold with real money or earn gold by downloading other games.|$|R
25|$|The American $100 {{bill has}} some competition, {{primarily}} from the €500 note. The larger value of the banknote {{makes it easier to}} transport larger amounts of money. As an example, $1 million in currency in $100 bills weighs 22 pounds, if, say, you were to carry it on board an airplane. It is difficult to carry this much money without a <b>briefcase</b> <b>and</b> some physical security. The same amount in €500 notes would weigh less than three pounds, and it could probably be dispersed in clothing and in luggage without attracting attention or alerting a security device. For many illegal operations, the problem of transporting currency is more difficult than transporting cocaine because of the size and weight of the currency. The ease of transporting banknotes makes the euro very attractive to Latin American drug cartels.|$|E
25|$|The eighth {{match was}} between The Giant and The Taskmaster, and Arn Anderson and Chris Benoit. The Giant and The Taskmaster {{attacked}} Anderson and Benoit during their {{entrance into the}} arena. McMichael hit The Giant with a <b>briefcase</b> <b>and</b> The Giant chased him backstage. This allowed Benoit and Anderson to double-team The Taskmaster. The match officially started as The Giant returned to the ring. Benoit and Anderson continued to attack The Taskmaster {{for the first half}} of the match and prevented The Giant from tagging in. The Giant finally tagged in after The Taskmaster delivered a belly to back suplex. As The Giant dominated Anderson in the ring, Benoit fought The Taskmaster outside. The Giant performed a chokeslam, pinned Anderson for the win, and returned backstage. After the match, Benoit continued to attack The Taskmaster. Woman came down, but failed to stop Benoit. Benoit finally stopped when The Giant came back out.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match of}} the night was a Last Man Standing match between Edge and Chris Benoit. The match started out with Benoit getting the upper hand. Edge then got the upper hand by {{throwing}} Benoit sternum first into the turnbuckles. Benoit then applied the Sharpshooter on Edge. Benoit then performed multiple German suplexes on Edge, which sent Edge outside to the floor. Benoit dived through the ropes, but was met with a trash can lid to the face. Edge hit a superplex on Benoit through a trash can. Edge grabbed a ladder and dragged it into the ring, only to get a German suplex off of the ladder. Benoit missed a diving headbutt {{off the top of}} the ladder, Edge grabbed the Money in the Bank briefcase, but was caught in the Crippler Crossface. Edge got out of the Crippler Crossface and performed an Edgecution on Benoit on the briefcase. Benoit reached his feet at nine, only to get speared by Edge. After spearing Benoit again, Edge pulled a brick out of his <b>briefcase</b> <b>and</b> hit Benoit in the back of his head, leaving Benoit unable to answer the ten count.|$|E

As the money greatly exceeded Powell's salary, which was at the most $30,000 per year, a federal investigation examined Powell's behavior while in office. The investigation determined that Powell had acquired the money via illegal cash bribes {{and led to the}} imprisonment of several state contractors.|$|R
