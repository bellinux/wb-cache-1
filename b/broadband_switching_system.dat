40|$|The traffic {{within the}} control unit of a <b>broadband</b> <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> is {{modelled}} by a stochastic Petri net. In particular, random switches {{included in this}} Petri net concept are applied to model the separation of signalling data according {{to the type of}} service requested by the subscribers, and the multiple use of the picture phone during a telephone session is modelled by correlated parallel paths in the Petri net model. The size and the complexity of the Petri net presented is independent of the number of processors of the control unit. The Petri net is analysed by evaluating the Markov chain equivalent to the net. In this connection for the evaluation of the entire control unit the decomposition of the transition rate matrix corresponding to the net is proposed. A performance measure associated with the switching delay is presented in order to show the applicability of the approach. Two configurations of the control unit are investigated and the results are presented graphically...|$|E

Objective of {{this thesis}} are load control and {{performance}} control concepts for <b>broadband</b> <b>switching</b> <b>systems.</b> Focus is the services integrating network technology B-ISDN using ATM as transfer mode. The studied mechanisms and concepts are principally of generic nature. Specifically {{they are designed}} within the envisaged context of B-ISDN, due to its extensive vision with respect to service integration, Quality of Service (QoS) support and ATM bearer capabilities. Area of application is implicitly the network control plane, but interactions between user and control plane have to be considered, too. The prime scope are switching nodes between access and core network domain, i. e., B-ISDN switches which have to provide user-to-network and network-to-network signalling protocol functions. Thus, beside service distinction call type differentiation is also covered due to the considered network positioning...|$|R
40|$|A {{framework}} for joint scheduling and admission control in <b>broadband</b> <b>switching</b> <b>systems</b> is developed {{according to a}} principle of separation between these two levels of control. It is shown how an admission control strategy can be tailored to a particular mix of traffic by making use of high-level information from the scheduler. This principle {{is presented in the}} context of Asynchronous TimeSharing (ATS), in which explicit guarantees of cell-level and call-level quality of service (QOS) are given to several traffic classes. The separation principle allows the formulation of an optimal admission control policy, which will maximize the expected system utility while maintaining all QOS guarantees. Several heuristic admission control policies are considered, and compared against the optimal policy as a benchmark. The admissible load region is introduced as a means of quantifying the capacity of a switch under the QOS constraints at the cell and call levels. Numerical calculations for a single [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is {{composed}} of components. The components do not interact with one another. Rather, they all interact with the same environment, which switches one of them on at each moment in time. In standard concurrency, a component restricts {{the environment of the}} other components, thus the concurrent system has fewer behaviors than its components. On the other hand, in a <b>switched</b> <b>system,</b> a component suggests an alternative to the other components, thus the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> has richer behaviors than its components. We study finite-state <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> where each of the underlying components is a finite-state transducer. While the main challenge, namely compositionality, is similar in standard concurrent <b>systems</b> and in <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> the problems and solutions are different. In the verification front, we suggest and study an assumeguarantee paradigm for <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> and study formalisms in which satisfaction of a specification in all components imply its satisfaction in the <b>switched</b> <b>system.</b> In the synthesis front, we show that while compositional synthesis and design are undecidable, the problem of synthesizing a switching rule with which a given <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> satisfies an LTL specification is decidable. ...|$|R

30|$|A <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is {{a hybrid}} {{dynamical}} system {{consisting of a}} finite number of subsystems and a logical rule that manages switching between these subsystems. <b>Switched</b> <b>systems</b> have drawn {{a great deal of attention}} in recent years; see [1 – 37] and references therein. The motivation for studying <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> comes partly from the fact that <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> and <b>switched</b> multicontroller <b>systems</b> have numerous applications in control of mechanical systems, process control, automotive industry, power systems, aircraft and traffic control, and many other fields. An important qualitative property of <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is stability [1 – 3]. The challenge of analyzing the stability of <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> lies partly in the fact that, even if the individual systems are stable, the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> might be unstable. Using a common quadratic Lyapunov function on all subsystems, the quadratic Lyapunov stability facilitates the analysis and synthesis of <b>switched</b> <b>systems.</b> However, the obtained results within this framework have been recognized to be conservative. In [10], various algorithms both for stability and performance analysis of discrete-time piece-wise affine systems were presented. Different classes of Lyapunov functions were considered, and how to compute them through linear matrix inequalities was also shown. Moreover, the tradeoff between the degree of conservativeness and computational requirements was discussed. The problem of stability analysis and control synthesis of <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> in the discrete-time domain was addressed in [11]. The approach followed in [11] looked at the existence of a switched quadratic Lyapunov function to check asymptotic stability of the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> under consideration. Two different linear matrix inequality-based conditions allow to check the existence of such a Lyapunov function. These two conditions have been proved to be equivalent for stability analysis.|$|R
