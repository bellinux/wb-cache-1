50|$|The mast was {{destroyed}} by retreating German troops in World War II, but was later rebuilt in 1946. In 1968 the tower was upgraded to serve the new 300 kW transmitter (amongst others, the ceramic <b>base</b> <b>insulator</b> had to be replaced to withstand the higher voltages).|$|E
50|$|One usually {{constructs}} the folded-unipole from {{an existing}} monopole antenna by shorting out the <b>base</b> <b>insulator,</b> thus connecting the tower {{directly to the}} ground system. Then a series of vertical wires, typically four to eight, are installed from an attachment {{near the top of}} the tower, kept a constant distance from the tower by structural members containing insulators, then attached together near the bottom of the tower. The resulting skirt connects to the tower top and remains insulated throughout its entire length. The wires of the skirt connect at the feed-point near the bottom.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} article {{is to determine the}} way to install surge arresters close to a power transformer to provide protection against lightning overvoltage. Depending on the length of the cables used in the installation, the insulation levels in <b>base</b> <b>insulators</b> of surge arresters and bushings of transformers change according to the voltage they support. For validation purposes, the voltage at <b>base</b> <b>insulators</b> and bushings has been analysed for different cable lengths in a typical substation. The results obtained from the simulations conducted with the ATP-EMTP software show the maximum lengths that cannot be exceeded for each insulation level selected for <b>base</b> <b>insulators</b> and bushings in case of a 145 kV power transformer...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{polymeric}} insulators are widely replacing the traditionally used glass and porcelain <b>based</b> <b>insulators.</b> They have become dominant in HVDC transmission systems operating at high voltage levels such as 800 kV. The withstand performance of {{polymeric insulators}} {{in relation to}} impulse flashover characteristics was extensively studied during {{the last couple of}} decades and quite broadly documented in the literature. The knowledge on dc flashover characteristics of polymeric insulators, in combination with the surface charge accumulation, is needed to be developed and it is a topic of ongoing research...|$|R
50|$|A typical AM {{broadcast}} antenna is a series-fed {{monopole antenna}} above a ground system. The ground system normally comprises 120 buried copper or phosphor bronze radial wires at least one-quarter wavelength long and a ground-screen {{in the immediate}} vicinity of the tower. All the ground system components are bonded together, usually by brazing or using coin silver solder to minimize corrosion. These antennas have insulated bases. If required, insulated guy wires are used. Radio frequency power is fed across the <b>base</b> <b>insulator</b> between the ground system and the tower itself. In the US, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required that the transmitter power measurements for a single series-fed tower calculated at this feed point as the current squared multiplied by the resistive part of the feed-point impedance.|$|E
50|$|When {{used for}} radio broadcasting, the radio {{frequency}} power from the broadcasting transmitter is fed across the <b>base</b> <b>insulator</b> between the tower and a ground system. The ideal ground system for AM broadcasters comprises at least 120 buried copper or phosphor bronze radial wires at least one-quarter wavelength long and a ground-screen {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the tower. All the ground system components are bonded together, usually by welding, brazing or using coin silver solder to help reduce corrosion. Monopole antennas that use guy-wires for support are called masts in some countries. In the United States, the term “mast” is generally used to describe a pipe supporting a smaller antenna, so both self-supporting and guy-wire supported radio antennas are simply called monopoles if they stand alone. If multiple monopole antennas are used in order to control the direction of radio frequency (RF) propagation, they are called directional antenna arrays.|$|E

50|$|The aerial {{for medium}} wave {{transmissions}} consisted of one 248 metre high guyed steel tube mast, which was insulated against ground, and a reflector mast of equal height 95 m {{east of the}} former. The latter was made unnecessary when the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975 came into effect, was dismantled in 1984 and re-erected at Wachenbrunn transmitter site, where it remained until 19 September 2013. Hydraulic jacks could lift the masts from their <b>base</b> <b>insulators</b> to avoid damage of the latter e.g. when sonic booms from military aircraft were expected. The reflector mast also carried aerials for FM broadcasting and television.|$|R
40|$|Epoxy resins {{blended with}} micro-sized alumina show more compact surface {{condition}} and exhibit lower light emission after modified in fluorinated atmosphere. Surface morphology reflected by {{atomic force microscope}} shows that the fluorinated surface layer can overlap alumina particles inlayed in the original surface and a smoother and more compact surface condition is generated. Thermally stimulated current test exhibits that surface fluorination is able to bring more shallow traps to surface states, and the trap amount increases with the extension of fluorinating time. The photon counting technique illustrates that the fluorinated surface has lower light emission which indicates better aging inhibition properties. Therefore, {{we believe that the}} surface fluorination technique may have potential significance in modifying epoxy <b>based</b> <b>insulators</b> used in high voltage applications...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} {{possibility}} of bandgap engineering in Ti-oxide <b>based</b> <b>insulators,</b> we investigated the effect of added cations of another kind (Hf, Ta, Sr) on the optical absorption and photoconductivity of thin titanate films. A bandgap of 3. 1 - 3. 4 eV, typical for pure polycrystalline TiO 2, was found in crystallized SrxTiyOz of different composition {{as well as in}} amorphous Ta 2 Ti 3 Oz. By contrast, the gap width of Hf titanates increases starting from 3. 5 eV for 30 % Hf/(Hf + Ti) to 4. 2 eV for 84 % Hf/(Hf + Ti). We suggest that this gap widening is associated with reduced interaction between electron states of neighboring Ti cations as influenced by a wide-gap (E-g = 5. 6 eV) HfO 2 sub-network.

Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) tunnel junctions have been explored for the past five decades and are still being investigated due to its wide use of applications such as mixers, capacitors, detectors, rectifiers and energy conversion devices. In this research, various designs of thin film based tunnel junctions have been investigated and the optimum one picked for the purpose of a wide band detector up to 10 GHz based on their sensitivities. A modified design with an isolation layer incorporating a self-aligning method to increase fabrication throughput was developed. A mask for the reliability testing of multiple devices with different areas was also developed. Nickel Oxide <b>based</b> <b>insulators</b> with different stoichiometries have been incorporated in the fabrication of the device to identify which stoichiometry gives the best performance for high frequency applications. Nickel Oxide (NiO), Zinc Oxide (ZnO) and the combination of the two have been deposited using reactive sputtering and investigated as insulator materials. The bilayer devices showed increased sensitivities at lower turn on voltages and very good efficiencies at 100 MHz and 1 GHz. Although, the MIM device provides a simple structure, some of the critical parameters required to quantify the device functionality are still being explored.

Interestingly, these phenomena occur without the presence of metallic nanoclusters enclosed in the melanin matrix. Charge trapping is considered the main mechanism responsible for the melanin memory-like character. The inability to erase the memory window has been ascribed to the permanent polarization effect during the application of the voltage pulse...|$|R
