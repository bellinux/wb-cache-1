40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{evaluate}} the marginal sealing ability of a <b>bulk</b> fill flowable <b>resin</b> composite on both enamel and dentin substrates. Materials and Methods: 48 non-carious molars were selected and four Class-V cavities were prepared at the CEJ of each sample. Cavities were filled with Venus Diamond (Heraeus Kulzer); Venus Diamond Flow (Heraeus Kulzer) and Surefil SDR (Dentsply). Samples {{were divided into two}} groups: First group samples were immersed in a methylene blue solution for 30 min at 25 °C. Second group samples were artificially aged and then treated with methylene blue. Samples were sectioned {{in the center of the}} restoration and observed with a 40 x stereomicroscope, and the percentage of cavity infiltration was calculated. Results: Results were analyzed statistically by ANOVA (P < 0. 05). The amount of infiltration was significantly lower for the enamel substrate compared with dentin (P = 0. 0001) and in samples immediately immersed in methylene blue compared with those that were artificially aged (P = 0. 011). The interaction between the composite material and the marginal substrate significantly affected dye penetration (P = 0. 006).

40|$|Abstract Introduction Despite {{advances}} and innovations in restorative dentistry, microleakage {{remains one of}} the main problems in this area. Objective To evaluate in vitro marginal microleakage of <b>Bulk</b> Fill <b>resins</b> in class II cavities, with cervical termination in the dentin. Material and method Cavities, standardized on the mesial and distal surfaces, were prepared in forty top molars and randomly assigned to four groups (n = 10), according to the resin used. G 1 (control) : Filtek Z 350 (3 M/ESPE); G 2 : Filtek Bulk Fill flow (3 M/ESPE); G 3 : Surefill SDR (Dentsply); G 4 : X-tra (Voco). These were further subdivided into subgroups according to the strategy used to apply the adhesive (self-etch technique and conventional). After storage for 24 hours in an oven (37 °C), the samples were submitted to the thermocycling test (500 cycles: 5 °C/ 55 °C). They were later waterproofed, immersed in Basic Fuchsin (0. 5 %) and sectioned in the mesial-distal direction for evaluation using a stereo magnifying glass at 40 X (Coleman) Scores from 0 to 3 were assigned according to the microinfiltration observed. The Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests, with a significance level of 5 %, were used for statistical analysis. Result There was no statistically significant difference between the <b>Bulk</b> Fill <b>resins</b> when the total acid-etching technique was used. Only the Filtek <b>Bulk</b> fill flow <b>resin</b> presented statistically significant results when the application of the adhesive system strategy was considered, with worse results, in relation to other groups, when it the self-etching strategy was considered.

Class I cavities (4 x 5 x 4 mm), C-factor = 4. 2, were performed on caries-free human third molars and randomly divided into five groups (n = 6) : FSI (Filtek Supreme XTE incremental insertion); FSS [(Filtek Supreme XTE single insertion(SI) ]; TBF [(Tetric Bulk Fill: SI and manual filling (MF) ]; SFM (Sonic Fill: SI/MF); and SFS (SonicFill: SI and sonic filling). The teeth were scanned and analyzed by μCT at T 0, after filling the cavity with resin, and at T 1, after polymerization for VG and VV, and for VS (T 1 -T 0). There was statistically significant difference in VS in μCT for the FSI and FSS groups and between SFS and FSS {{as well as some}} difference in VV for FSI and <b>bulk</b> fill <b>resin</b> composites and no difference in VG between the conventional technique and bulk fill composites. <b>Bulk</b> fill <b>resin</b> composites presented similar VS and gap formation to those of incrementally inserted conventional resin composites.

SBS of 2 mm/ 4 mm/ 6 mm thick resin composite increments was measured to dentin surfaces of extracted human molars treated with the adhesive system OptiBond FL, and the failure mode was stereomicroscopically determined at 40 × magnification. HV profiles and failure modes were descriptively analysed whereas HV at the bottom of resin composite specimens and SBS were statistically analysed with nonparametric ANOVA followed by Wilcoxon rank sum tests (α= 0. 05).

We investigated the damage and plasticity induced by the addition of carbon nanotubes to the matrix of a glass fiber/epoxy composite system. We characterized both the modified epoxy resin and the associated modified laminates using classical mesoscale analysis. We used dynamic mechanical analysis, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and classical mechanical testing to characterize samples with different concentrations of nanofillers. Since the samples were prepared using the solvent evaporation technique, we also studied the influence of this process.

Additionally, in order to compare different surface preparations and testing methods, a cross check of EC test was carried out among different laboratories. This characterization was complemented with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses, results of which were used to rule out a complete filtering effect of the CNTs.

40|$|The {{influence}} of graphene oxide (GO) and its surface oxidized debris (OD) on the cure chemistry of an amine cured epoxy resin {{has been investigated}} by Fourier Transform Infrared Emission Spectroscopy (FT-IES) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Spectral analysis of IR radiation emitted at the cure temperature from thin films of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A epoxy resin (DGEBA) and 4, 4 '-diaminodiphenylmethane (DDM) curing agent with and without GO allowed the cure kinetics of the interphase between the <b>bulk</b> <b>resin</b> and GO to be monitored in real time, by measuring both the consumption of primary (1 °) amine and epoxy groups, formation of ether {{groups as well as}} computing the profiles for formation of secondary (2 °) and tertiary (3 °) amines. OD was isolated from as-produced GO (aGO) by a simple autoclave method to give OD-free autoclaved GO (acGO). It has been found that the presence of OD on the GO prevents active sites on GO surfaces fully catalysing and participating in the reaction of DGEBA with DDM, which results in slower reaction and a lower crosslink density of the three-dimensional networks in the aGO-resin interphase compared to the acGO-resin interphase. We also determined that OD itself promoted DGEBA homopolymerization.

40|$|Work is {{reported}} on composites comprising either epoxy resin or crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) filled with silica nanoparticles (surface functionalisated and unfunctionalisated). Measurements {{were made of}} the dielectric spectra, charging and discharging currents under high electric fields, and space charge dynamics using the pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) technique. Considerable studies were made {{of the effect of}} humidity on epoxy nanocomposites. It was found that the epoxy composites filled with nanoparticles could absorb up to 60 % more water by weight than the unfilled epoxy. For composites filled with microparticles, nearly all the water was absorbed by the resin. The glass transition temperature (Tg) for all epoxy samples, measured by both differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dielectric spectroscopy, showed a monotonic reduction with increase of hydration resulting in a 20 K decrease for fully hydrated samples. This led {{to the conclusion that the}} extra hydration found in the nanocomposites was not in the <b>bulk</b> <b>resin</b> but was likely to be located on the surface of the nanoparticles. This is further supported by measurement of the hydration isotherms at room temperature and the resultant swelling as a function of humidity. A "water shell" model is developed in which there is an inner layer of approximately 5 – 10 bound water molecules on the surface of the nanoparticles, a further layer, approximately 25 nm thick, in which water is in sufficient concentration to allow conduction, and an outer layer, approximately 50 nm thick, which cannot support true conduction (i. e. the continuous movement of charge carriers.) This model is used to explain the sub-hertz dielectric results (in terms of percolation limited conduction) as well as those at around 1 – 10 Hz that indicate the presence of bound or free water.

40|$|Hierarchically {{structured}} fibre reinforced poly mer (FRP) composites are a {{new generation}} of struc tural materials with high potential for tailored d esign. The increased degree of freedom in material selection and design is the main advantage o f these materials over conventional composites. Ho wever, the available literature still lacks a comp rehensive study on the structure-property relation ship and the interactions between the constit uents in these composite materials. This wor k aims at exploring various aspects of new hi erarchically structured carbon fibre polymer compo sites (CFRP) with the goal of understanding the in terplay between the different components in r elation to their mechanical properties and fractur e. Multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and a ph ase separating thermoplastic modifier (polyoxymeth ylene (POM)) are the main structural elements ¨used to form the microstructure of the studied ma terials. The principal approach adopted in t his work is to establish an initial understanding¨ of the structure-property relationship in binary (POM/epoxy or CNT/epoxy) and ternary (POM/CNT/epoxy) <b>bulk</b> <b>resin</b> blends. This involves a study of the¨ phase morphology, dynamic mechanical properties, a nd fracture toughness of various types of bulk res in blends with different compositions. At the next ¨step, fiber reinforced composites based on the pr eviously studied matrix blends are produced a nd characterized. Considering the challenges invol ved in the processing of the POM modified matrix b lends into the corresponding composites at high te mperature, a new manufacturing technique based on¨ resin transfer molding is developed and furth er optimized. The knowledge acquired during the st udy of the matrix blends is employed to expla in morphological observations as well as fracture¨ properties and damage behaviour monitored during q uasi-static tensile loading of the produced lamina tes. A correlation between the microstructure and phase morphology of the matrix and the proper ties of the laminates is established. It is shown that phase separated POM particles are able to enhance fracture toughness of bulk e poxy resins, as long as the particulate morph ology is dominant. Fracture toughness and ultimate ¨mechanical properties of the <b>bulk</b> <b>resin</b> materials ¨are shown to be highly sensitive to the phas e morphology of the phase-separated blend. Th erefore, any external factors affecting phase sepa ration of the thermoplastic modified blends can dr astically influence resulting properties. For ¨instance, it is illustrated that the presence of¨ fiber reinforcement changes the phase morphology o f the matrix and, hence, affects the transfer ¨of the toughness improvements of the bulk re sin to the laminates. Inclusion of CNTs is a lso shown to influence the phase morphology of the¨bulk resin as well as the microstructure of the r esulting hierarchical laminates. It is shown¨ that CNTs limit mass diffusion during phase separa tion of the thermoplastic phase, causing redu ction in the particle size of the resulting thermo plastic particles. This in turn affects the fractu re toughness of the <b>bulk</b> <b>resin</b> blends and damage d evelopment in the resulting CFRP laminate.

40|$|The {{adhesion}} {{and subsequent}} {{failure of a}} commercially available photocured resin applied to various ceramic substrates, used for electronics applications, has been investigated. The adhesive system was studied under both ambient and hostile, (water immersion at 50 °C) conditions. The environmental stability of the system was investigated using two different mechanical tests, (simple butt-joints and a modified Boeing wedge test). In each case, the precise locus of failure was determined {{by a combination of}} surface analytical (XPS and ToF-SIMS) and microscopy techniques, (SEM). On the basis of these results, adhesion and failure mechanisms are proposed for the system. The presence of defects within the adhesive was found to initiate failure under ambient, (dry) conditions. Prolonged immersion in water, (for at least 2 weeks), was found to result in near-interfacial failure with a thin, (of the order of nanometres), overlayer of polymer remaining {{on the surface of the}} adherend. Subtle differences between this polymer overlayer and the <b>bulk</b> <b>resin</b> were observed. A model is proposed in which one of the minor resin components aggregates at the inorganic surface, creating a localised region which is extremely hydrophillic in nature. This makes the system particularly vulnerable to attack by water. In order to test this model, a reformulated batch of resin underwent the same environmental tests. The modified resin displayed a modest improvement in its ability to withstand hostile conditions, (prolonged immersion in water at 50 °C) and the polymer residue remaining on the inorganic substrate was identical to that of the bulk polymer. This project has provided a unique opportunity to study the adhesion of a specific class of adhesives to bulk ceramic oxides, rather than to oxides of metals. One of the major benefits of which, was therefore the absence of any effects due to corrosion of the substrate. The project was also unusual in that it effectively went "full-circle", with the resin undergoing reformulation on the basis of the results obtained from the standard resin. The reformulated product was found to have superior wet adhesion, but poor mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the fatigue {{resistance}} of restored teeth with <b>bulk</b> fill composite <b>resin,</b> conventional composite resin with incremental insertion and unprepared sound teeth. Twenty-eight extracted maxillary premolars were selected and divided into 4 groups based on composite resin and insertion technique: control (C), conventional composite resin with incremental insertion (I) and <b>bulk</b> fill composite <b>resin</b> with three (BF 3) or single increment (BF 1). The restored specimens were submitted to fatigue resistance test with a 5 Hz frequency. An initial application of 5, 000 sinusoidal load cycles with a minimum force of 50 N and a maximum force of 200 N was used. Next, were applied stages of 30, 000 load cycles with the maximum force increasing gradually: 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200 and 1400 N. The test was concluded when 185, 000 load cycles were achieved or the specimen failed. The fatigue resistance data were recorded for comparison, using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and analyzed by log-rank test at 0. 05 significance. Fractures were classified based on the position of the failure - above or below the cementoenamel junction (CEJ). Statistical analysis of the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log-rank test showed a significant difference between groups (p= 0. 001). The fracture analysis demonstrated that only 28. 58 % of failures were below the CEJ in group C, while for groups I, BF 1 and BF 3 they were 42. 85 %, 85. 71 % and 85. 71 %, respectively. Teeth restored with composite bulk fill in both techniques present similar fatigue resistance values compared with those restored with a conventional incremental insertion of composite, while the fatigue strength values of unprepared sound teeth were higher. Furthermore, unprepared sound teeth showed a lower percentage of fractures below the CEJ...|$|R

50|$|Dielectrometry: The {{technique}} of conventional dielectrometry carried out typically {{in a parallel}} plate configuration of the dielectric sensor (Capacitance probe), has the capability of monitoring the resin cure throughout the entire cycle, from the liquid to the rubber to the solid state and remains the only technique capable of monitoring phase separation in complex resin blends curing within a fibrous perform. The same attributes belong to the more recent development of the dielectric technique, namely microdielectrometry. Several versions of dielectric sensors are available commercially. The most suitable format for use in cure monitoring applications are the flat interdigital capacitive structures bearing a sensing grid on their surface. Depending on their design (specifically those on durable substrates) they have some reusability, while flexible substrate sensors can be used also in the <b>bulk</b> of the <b>resin</b> systems as embedded sensors.|$|R

40|$|Polymer matrix {{composites}} with textile reinforcement {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of aerospace and industrial applications. Continuum mechanical predictions of the composite behaviors have been inaccurate and resorted to empirical corrections, because of the lack of polymer materials property information. The length scales involved make experimental measurement of the elastic properties of the matrix within fiber tows and proximity to individual fibers difficult. However, micro-Brillouin and Raman light scattering provide sufficiently high spatial resolution to probe the mechanical properties and chemical composition of the matrix, without interfering with the thermo-mechanical equilibrium of the material. The elastic properties of epoxy resin have been measured between and within the fiber tows of a composite with this technique, and compared to a <b>bulk</b> epoxy <b>resin.</b> Using this approach, the elastic properties have also been monitored in situ, during epoxy cure under different thermal and chemical conditions. To interpret and enhance these results, experiments are complemented with molecular dynamics simulations of the interface extrapolating findings to nanometer length scales. We observe that matrix materials in close proximity to fibers have a diminished elastic modulus compared with both bulk epoxy and material between tows. To explain the underlying reason for this finding we identify the extent to which residual stresses, chemical inhomogeneities, or purely structural rearrangements near the interface contribute to this effect. Finally, we correlate the spatial distribution of mechanical properties with the cure history...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNatural resins are prone, {{like all}} natural organic products, to ageing and degradation. Characterizing this {{alteration}} provides better knowledge about their chemistry, {{and when they}} are involved in cultural heritage artefacts, it helps to define relevant conservation protocols. In this study, a set of archaeological African copals that present specific surface degradations and colors were analyzed by FT-Raman and ATR-IR spectroscopies. A methodology based on the modifications of the vibrational features between the <b>bulk</b> and the <b>resin</b> surface was defined. A relationship between the evolution of the molecular structure of the copal samples and some vibrational bands could be established; and possible ageing reactions occurring at the surface of the samples could be proposed. This specific surface aspect is actually related to an alteration, and the surface states and the color variability are linked to different alteration degrees. This could refer to different conservation contexts (presence of air, water, etc), possible preparation or different origins: for example the collection of fresh or partly fossilized resins...|$|R
40|$|Electron {{irradiation}} {{experiments have}} investigated the diverse electron-induced optical and electrical signatures observed in ground-based tests of various space observatory materials at low temperature. Three types of light emission were observed: (i); long-duration cathodoluminescence which persisted {{as long as the}} electron beam was on (ii) short-duration (< 1 s) arcing, resulting from electrostatic discharge; and (iii) intermediate-duration (~ 100 s) glow-termed "flares". We discuss how the electron currents and arcing-as well as light emission absolute intensity and frequency-depend on electron beam energy, power, and flux and the temperature and thickness of different <b>bulk</b> (polyimides, epoxy <b>resins,</b> and silica glasses) and composite dielectric materials (disordered SiO 2 thin films, carbon- and fiberglass-epoxy composites, and macroscopically-conductive carbon-loaded polyimides). We conclude that electron-induced optical emissions resulting from interactions between observatory materials and the space environment electron flux can, in specific circumstances, make significant contributions to the stray light background that could possibly adversely affect the performance of space-based observatories...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} with nonreactive {{molecular dynamics}} simulations the dynamic response of phenolic resin and its carbon-nanotube (CNT) composites to shock wave compression. For phenolic resin, our simulations yield shock states {{in agreement with}} experiments on similar polymers except the “phase change” observed in experiments, indicating that such phase change is chemical in nature. The elastic–plastic transition is characterized by shear stress relaxation and atomic-level slip, and phenolic resin shows strong strain hardening. Shock loading of the CNT-resin composites is applied parallel or perpendicular to the CNT axis, and the composites demonstrate anisotropy in wave propagation, yield and CNT deformation. The CNTs induce stress concentrations in the composites and may increase the yield strength. Our simulations suggest that the bulk shock response of the composites depends on the volume fraction, length ratio, impact cross-section, and geometry of the CNT components; the short CNTs in current simulations have insignificant effect on the <b>bulk</b> response of <b>resin</b> polymer...|$|R
40|$|An IRA- 743 <b>resin</b> <b>bulk</b> sampler was {{validated}} {{to monitor}} long-term bulk deposition of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). Six consecutive sampling campaigns (2008 - 2009) were conducted at four sites around steel complexes in Pohang, South Korea to investigate spatial and seasonal variations of PCDD/F bulk deposition. The bulk deposition within the steel complex showed the highest Sigma(4 - 8) PCDD/F (Tetra-Octa) fluxes, ranging from 204 to 608 (mean: 352) pg m(- 2) d(- 1), indicating steel complexes were {{major sources of}} PCDD/Fs. The homologue profiles were dominated with lower chlorinated PCDFs. Furthermore, the prevailing winds were confirmed to influence the spatial distribution of PCDD/F deposition. There were apparent seasonal variations of the bulk deposition at each site, and seasonal homologue patterns of PCDD/Fs were clearly observed. According to the passive air sampling, however, no significant seasonal change of ambient air concentrations of PCDD/Fs was observed. Therefore, {{it was concluded that}} the seasonal variations of deposition fluxes of PCDD/Fs probably resulted from temperature-dependent gas/particle partitioning. close 9...|$|R
