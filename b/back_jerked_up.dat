60|$|Gallagher's hand wavered. From outside {{came the}} shouts of the Sheriff and his men, {{struggling}} to {{fight their way}} in through the little crowd who were rushing for safety. Suddenly Quest <b>backed,</b> <b>jerked</b> the pistol <b>up</b> with his right elbow, and with almost the same movement struck Red Gallagher under the jaw. The man went over with a crash. His mate, who had been staggering about, cursing viciously, fired another wild shot at Quest, who swayed and fell forward.|$|R
60|$|She involuntarily looked down. But its tatterdemalion {{presence}} relieved her, and {{her face}} <b>jerked</b> <b>up</b> scarlet.|$|R
60|$|That made me angry. <b>Jerking</b> <b>up</b> in bed, I {{caught the}} heavy pitcher from the wash-stand {{and flung it}} with all my might.|$|R
6000|$|He irritably read a {{few more}} lines, then <b>jerked</b> <b>up</b> his head in sudden decision, glared at {{the open door of}} the house, and called: ...|$|R
60|$|The woman threshed {{towards it}} like a panic-stricken goose, fell on her knees, was <b>jerked</b> <b>up</b> again by Midmore, and pushed on till she {{collapsed}} at Miss Sperrit's feet.|$|R
60|$|GUY. [Soothingly] Don't try, sir. [He <b>jerks</b> <b>up</b> his chin, listening] I think that's her. [Goes to the door] Yes. Now, please! [He {{opens the}} door] Your father and mother, Athene.|$|R
6000|$|Jones stooped {{over the}} place I designated, to <b>jerk</b> <b>up</b> with {{reddening}} face, and as he flung himself into the saddle roared out: [...] "After Sounder! Old Tom! Old Tom! Old Tom!" ...|$|R
6000|$|And Ghibba said softly, <b>jerking</b> <b>up</b> his bundle and peering {{around him}} from beneath his eye-bandage: [...] "Courage, my kinsmen! {{it is the}} danger-song of Tishnar we hear, who loves the fearless." ...|$|R
6000|$|He was {{thinking}} so deeply {{of her that}} {{the sound of her}} voice, pronouncing these unexpected words, startled him extremely. He <b>jerked</b> <b>up</b> his head and looked so bewildered that Freya insisted impatiently: ...|$|R
5000|$|A Bunch of Jerks: Several players act out scenes wearing suits {{attached}} to cables {{from the studio}} rafters and when anyone makes a mistake, they are <b>jerked</b> <b>up</b> nearly 20 feet off the floor.|$|R
60|$|For {{a second}} I {{thought he was}} going to run away. Then he <b>jerked</b> <b>up</b> his head, and rushed on towards the house. At the foot of the {{staircase}} he gripped me by the shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I mean to say, his {{allowance}} and all that. The money you're {{good enough}} to give him. He was rather hoping that you might see your way to <b>jerking</b> <b>up</b> the total a bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so far away, Sire. Only {{the light}} was very bad, or I should have had the fourth. I aimed low, Sire, fearing to miss his skull, and he <b>jerked</b> <b>up</b> his horse's head to take the arrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|He <b>jerked</b> <b>up</b> his chin, {{testing the}} growth of his beard {{with the back of}} his hand while he fixed her with a single eye. [...] "Ah, I don't say that they'd {{necessarily}} tell me that they ARE over the traces." ...|$|R
60|$|There fell a tense silence. For some {{seconds the}} three {{regarded}} one another. The Prince eyed Bert steadfastly, and Bert quailed under his eye. Slowly the Prince {{rose to his}} feet and the bird-faced officer <b>jerked</b> <b>up</b> beside him. Bert remained squatting.|$|R
60|$|So he sat {{very still}} and nibbled at some leaves that were growing {{by the side}} of the path. He looked very pretty as he sat there, taking his dainty little bites, and <b>jerking</b> <b>up</b> his head every now and then, as if he were expecting somebody.|$|R
6000|$|The old wizard brooded for a space, while I {{reflected}} {{upon his}} amazing cynicism, which interested me in a way, for the extreme of unmorality is as fascinating to study as the extreme of virtue and often more so. Then <b>jerking</b> <b>up</b> his great head, he asked suddenly, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because----. Would {{you care}} {{to come up and}} look at my 'ouse and 'ave a smoke and a chat. Eh?" [...] He made {{indicative}} <b>back</b> <b>jerks</b> of the head, and was smitten with a horrible doubt whether possibly this invitation might not be some hideous breach of etiquette. Was it, for example, the correct hour? [...] "I'd be awfully glad if you would," [...] he added.|$|R
60|$|She had one enemy, the {{man they}} called Nut-Nat, or Nat-Nut, a cretin, with inturned feet, who came flap-lapping along, {{shoulder}} <b>jerking</b> <b>up</b> at every step. This poor creature sold nuts in the public-houses where he was known. He had no roof to his mouth, and the men used to mock his speech.|$|R
60|$|EMILY--John {{just came}} in from the garden. [Turning around to where JOHN is dozing in his chair--sharply.] John! Well I never! If he isn't falling asleep! John! [He <b>jerks</b> <b>up</b> his head and stares at her, {{blinking}} stupidly. She continues irritably.] A nice time to pick out for a nap, I must say.|$|R
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} {{we saw a}} rush of smoke far away up the river, {{a puff of smoke}} that <b>jerked</b> <b>up</b> into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing two or three windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished.|$|R
50|$|Usually singly, though {{sometimes}} in mixed hunting {{parties in the}} winter. Keeps largely to the low trees and bushes, feeding among the foliage canopy, not venturing much into the open. Constantly <b>jerks</b> <b>up</b> its tail, often accompanied by fluffing of head feathers and trrr note, especially in proximity of nest. Diet is mainly insects.|$|R
50|$|It moves about singly with a hopping gait, {{and often}} perches in {{prominent}} positions. It also roosts singly up to 3 metres aboves ground, in dense cover. The tail is regularly <b>jerked</b> <b>up</b> to an angle of 60 degrees, and upon alighting it may flick {{the wings and}} rapidly fan the tail. It bathes daily, even in tide pools.|$|R
60|$|After disarming their captive and tying {{his hands}} at his <b>back</b> they <b>jerked</b> {{him to his}} feet and {{examined}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... "That scoundrel {{came here}} one day," [...] he said. [...] "He {{had been away}} from the house {{for a couple of months}} living with that woman. I only heard about him now and then from Patalolo's people when they came over. Well one day, about noon, he {{appeared}} in this courtyard, as if he had been <b>jerked</b> <b>up</b> from hell-where he belongs." ...|$|R
60|$|He wore a true Andrea Ferrara {{tucked in}} a leathern belt, and a commodore's cocked hat {{on one side}} of his head. He was {{remarkable}} for always <b>jerking</b> <b>up</b> his breeches when he gave out his orders, and his voice sounded not unlike the brattling of a tin trumpet, owing to the number of hard north-westers which he had swallowed {{in the course of his}} seafaring.|$|R
60|$|In a jiffy I was trussed up as neatly as {{you might}} wish. One of the nooses dropped to my ankles and was <b>jerked</b> <b>up</b> with a suddenness that brought me to my face upon the ground. Then {{something}} heavy and hairy sprang upon my back. I fought to draw my knife, but hairy hands grasped my wrists and, dragging them be-hind my back, bound them securely.|$|R
6000|$|Major Hendricks lit {{a second}} cigarette. The {{landscape}} depressed him. Nothing but ash and ruins. He {{seemed to be}} alone, the only living thing in the whole world. To the right {{the ruins of a}} town rose up, a few walls and heaps of debris. He tossed the dead match away, increasing his pace. Suddenly he stopped, <b>jerking</b> <b>up</b> his gun, his body tense. For a minute it looked like-- ...|$|R
60|$|Going {{exceedingly}} pale, he <b>jerked</b> <b>up</b> {{his head}} {{and stared at the}} wall over the pillows. There was a little coloured picture of a bird perched on a bell, and a nest among ivy leaves beneath. It appealed to him, made him wonder, roused a feeling of childish magic in him. They were wonderfully fresh, green ivy leaves, and nobody had seen the nest among them save him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You paid me!" [...] she repeats with fierce disdain. [...] "Two sovereign! I {{have not}} change them, I re-fuse them, I des-pise them, I throw them from me!" [...] Which she {{literally}} does, taking {{them out of}} her bosom as she speaks and flinging them with such violence on the floor that they <b>jerk</b> <b>up</b> again into the light before they roll away into corners and slowly settle down there after spinning vehemently.|$|R
6000|$|... "A young gentleman and a {{young lady}} a kissing {{of each other in}} the railway coach," [...] says Hannah, <b>jerking</b> <b>up</b> with her finger to the ceiling, as much as to say, [...] "There she is! Lar, she be a pretty young creature, that she be! and so I told Miss Martha." [...] Thus {{differently}} had the news which had come to them on the previous night affected the old lady and her maid.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, she didn't stop once to cock it!" [...] cried Rectus, and I {{was amazed}} {{to see how she}} had fired so rapidly. But as soon as I had counted seven, I stepped up to her and took her pistol. She {{explained}} to me how it worked. It was one of those pistols in which the same pull of the trigger <b>jerks</b> <b>up</b> the hammer and lets it down,--the most unsafe things that any one can carry.|$|R
60|$|He was a gaunt {{man in a}} huge straw hat, and a coat {{of green}} stuff. The weather being hot, he had no cravat, and wore his shirt collar wide open; so that every time he spoke {{something}} was seen to twitch and <b>jerk</b> <b>up</b> in his throat, like the little hammers in a harpsichord when the notes are struck. Perhaps it was the Truth feebly endeavouring to leap to his lips. If so, it never reached them.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Jean's ears rang {{with the}} vibrant shock of a rifle report. He <b>jerked</b> <b>up,</b> strung and thrilling. It came from {{in front of}} the store. It was {{followed}} by revolver shots, heavy, booming. Three he counted, and the rest were too close together to enumerate. A single hoarse yell pealed out, somehow trenchant and triumphant. Other yells, not so wild and strange, muffled the first one. Then silence clapped down on the store and the open square.|$|R
60|$|He {{was highly}} strung, and worn by want {{of sleep and}} {{exhausting}} labor, but he had some notion of all Barbara had borne on Shillito's account. Although perhaps caution and tact were indicated, {{he was going to}} use force. When Shillito struck him he seized the fellow, and rocking in a savage grapple, they fell with a crash against the rails. Lister felt the other's hand at his throat, and straining <b>back,</b> <b>jerked</b> his head away while he tried to lift his antagonist off the ground. He pulled him from the rails and they reeled across the veranda and struck the wall.|$|R
6000|$|By {{a violent}} and unsuspected effort {{the old man}} <b>jerked</b> himself <b>up</b> and reached the bell. Mr. Ventnor heard it ring, and said sharply: ...|$|R
