5|$|A. piscivorus venom is more toxic {{than that}} of A. contortrix, and is rich with {{powerful}} cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue. Although deaths are rare, the bite can leave scars, and on occasion, require amputation. Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual, however, the venom does not cause systemic reactions in victims and does not contain neurotoxic components present in numerous rattlesnake species. Bites can <b>be</b> <b>effectively</b> treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave rattlesnake, and the cottonmouth).|$|E
5|$|Another source from 684 AD, {{during the}} Tang dynasty and {{recorded}} in Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, states {{that when the}} leaves are taken internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally they can <b>be</b> <b>effectively</b> used to treat boils, abscesses and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.|$|E

5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This makes them a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, semi-desert regions where not many other crops will grow. As {{well as an}} important source of food for humans in poor arid regions the crop can also be used as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can <b>be</b> <b>effectively</b> intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Britain proved for {{the first}} time that the Junkers Ju 87 was {{vulnerable}} in hostile skies against well-organised and determined fighter opposition. The Ju 87, like other dive bombers, was slow and possessed inadequate defences. Furthermore, it could not <b>be</b> <b>effectively</b> protected by fighters because of its low speed, and the very low altitudes at which it ended its dive bomb attacks. The Stuka depended on air superiority, the very thing being contested over Britain. It was withdrawn from attacks on Britain in August after prohibitive losses, leaving the Luftwaffe without precision ground-attack aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} drawback of {{the classical}} Fourier transformation is a rather narrow class of functions (originals) for which it can <b>be</b> <b>effectively</b> computed.

For example, the Fourier transform of such simple functions as polynomials does not exist in the classical sense. The extension {{of the classical}} Fourier transformation to distributions considerably enlarged the class of functions that could be transformed and this removed many obstacles.|$|E

5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether to prescribe an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by bacterial infection. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can <b>be</b> <b>effectively</b> treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme Court can {{overturn}} {{the decisions of}} the Oregon Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on the Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change the outcome of the case. The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, decisions of the court can <b>be</b> <b>effectively</b> overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{continued}} designs {{and interest in}} the idea, no funding was ever appropriated {{for the construction of}} a flight-deck cruiser; in addition, evaluation of the design by the Naval War College determined that even a 12,000-ton ship was too small for the concept's intended characteristics to <b>be</b> <b>effectively</b> realized, and thus the ship would be ineffective in battle. In 1940, the design was formally shelved, although provision was made for reconsideration of the concept at a future date. The entry of the United States into World War II following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, however, removed the primary justifications for the concept of a hybrid warship, as naval limitations treaties were now moot and adequate funding was now available for the construction of more conventional ships. As a result, the flight deck cruiser concept was never revisited.|$|E
