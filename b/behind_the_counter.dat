5|$|Wrigley Field is {{featured}} in two interwoven and consecutive scenes. In the first scene, Rooney {{is looking for}} Ferris at a pizza joint while the voice of Harry Caray announces the action of a ballgame that is being shown on TV. From the play-by-play descriptions, the uniforms, and the player numbers, this game {{has been identified as}} the June 5, 1985, game between the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago Cubs. The batter rips a foul ball into the left field stands, and as Rooney looks away from the TV briefly, the TV cameras show a close up of Ferris a moment after catching it. The scene in the pizza joint continues as Rooney tries to banter about the game with the guy <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{made the}} Tigers team in spring {{training}} 1945 before finishing high school and without having played in the minor leagues, but {{sat on the bench}} before making his major league debut in June 1945, just a few weeks after his 18th birthday. He made three relief appearances that month and two more in September after a two-month stint with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League under manager Bucky Harris, and was on the Detroit roster for the team's victory in the 1945 World Series although he did not appear in any games. He had a remarkably unassuming presence; Paul Richards, then a catcher for the Tigers, later recalled occasionally going to his neighborhood drugstore. One day, Pierce went up to him at practice and asked why Richards never talked to him at the store, with Richards replying that he didn't know what Pierce was talking about; Pierce answered that the drugstore was his family's, and Richards slowly realized that Pierce had been the clerk <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> each time he went in.|$|E

25|$|Owing to its {{recreational}} use {{and theft}} concerns, many retailers in the US have moved dextromethorphan-containing products <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> {{so that one}} must ask a pharmacist to receive them or be 18 years (19 in New York, Virginia, California, and Alabama, 21 in Mississippi) or older to purchase them.

President Bush signed the act into law on March 9, 2006. As a result of the act, certain cold medicines are only to be made available <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> and the amount of such medicines that can be purchased by one person is limited.|$|E
25|$|A drunken Raoul {{is sitting}} alone in a forlorn bar, contemplating the {{evolution}} {{of his relationship with}} Christine ("Why Does She Love Me?"). Meg enters and warns him that New York isn't a suitable place for his family, and she urges them to abandon Christine's performance contract and leave that night. Raoul refuses, citing their need for the money; he boasts that he is not afraid of the Phantom, unaware that his rival has since slipped in and replaced the barman <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> When Meg leaves, the Phantom confronts Raoul and intimidates him with veiled remarks that cause him to question his paternity of Gustave. The Phantom also offers Raoul a bet: if Christine fails to perform tonight, the Phantom will pay off all their debts and allow them to leave together, but if she sings the aria he has written for her, Raoul must go back to France alone. Raoul accepts the Phantom's dare and then experiences a moment of panic at what he has done ("Devil Take The Hindmost").|$|E

Her first role with Curzon was Sybil Cunningham in The White Chrysanthemum at the Criterion in 1905 (starring with Rutland Barrington and Henry Lytton) and then on tour. In early 1906, Jay separated from her husband. Her next role was Winnie Willoughby in The Girl <b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>Counter</b> (1906, with Hayden Coffin). For the next four years, she starred regularly in Curzon's West End productions, often at The Prince of Wales Theatre and often in a show written by Paul Rubens.

500|$|The {{interior}} {{consists of}} one large {{room on the}} south end, from the main entrance, and two smaller connecting rooms on the north.
