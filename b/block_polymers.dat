5000|$|Nano-particles can self-assemble {{on solid}} {{surfaces}} after applying external forces (like magnetic, electric, and flow) as {{mentioned in the}} above section. Templates made of microstructures like carbon nanotubes or <b>block</b> <b>polymers</b> {{can also be used}} to assist in self-assembly; they cause directed self-assembly (DSA) in which active sites are embedded to selectively induce nanoparticle deposition. Such templates are considered as any object onto which different particles can be arranged into a structure with a morphology similar to that of the template. Carbon nanotubes (microstructures), single molecules, or block copolymers are common templates. [...] Nanoparticles are often shown to self-assemble within distances of nanometers and micrometers, but block copolymer templates can be used to form well-defined self-assemblies over macroscopic distances. By incorporating active sites to the surfaces of nanotubes and polymers, the functionalization of these templates can be transformed to favor self-assembly of specified nanoparticles.|$|E
40|$|A {{ruthenium}} meso-tetra[4 -(vinylbenzoxy) benzyl]porphyrin catalyst {{with four}} meso-polymerizable side chains was synthesized in three steps from commercially available starting materials. The polymerizable side chains allowed {{the incorporation of}} this complex in various types of highly cross-linked mesoporous co-polymers. Core-shell microspheres were prepared in a two-step precipitation polymerization procedure. The porous shell contains the Ru-catalyst and divinylbenzene while the dense core is constituted only of divinylbenzene. A <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> and molecularly imprinted polymers containing the Ru-catalyst were prepared by co-polymerization with ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate. The imprinted polymers were prepared {{in the presence of}} primary amines as templates, which create a free substrate pocket next to the catalytically active center upon removal of the template. All polymers displayed high catalytic activity for the oxidation of alcohols and alkanes to the corresponding ketones with 2, 6 -dichloropyridine-N-oxide as the oxidant. A comparison of the catalytic activity of the Ru-catalyst, the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> and the imprinted polymer was made. While the homogeneous Ru-catalyst showed no activity, the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> was moderately active and the imprinted polymer displayed the highest activity. The increase of activity of the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> compared to the homogeneous Ru-catalyst {{can be explained by the}} site-isolation effect which prevents the irreversible dimerisation of the ruthenium porphyrin catalysts upon oxidation. The further increase of activity displayed by the imprinted polymer can be attributed to the free substrate pocket next to the active site which allows a better access of the substrates to the ruthenium center. With the polymer imprinted with 1 -adamantylamine, a substrate selectivity of 1. 4 in favor of 2 -adamantanol was observed for the oxidation of 2 -adamantanol in competition with 2 -octanol. However, with the other polymer imprinted with aminodiphenylmethane no such selectivity was recorded. It was possible to modulate both the activity and the selectivity of the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> using a fluorous solvent, perfluoromethylcyclohexane (PFMC). A large increase of catalytic activity was measured upon use of PFMC as a reaction co-solvent. Some substrate selectivity was also observed for substrates with different polarities. Both phenomena can be attributed to the increase of the local concentration of substrate in the polymer pores, which occurs to avoid contact with the very apolar PFMC solvent...|$|R

The polymer is known as Kraton and is used for shoe soles and adhesives. Owing to the microfine structure, the transmission electron microscope or TEM was needed to examine the structure. The butadiene matrix was stained with osmium tetroxide to provide contrast in the image. The material was made by living polymerization so that the blocks are almost monodisperse, so helping to create a very regular microstructure. The molecular weight of the polystyrene blocks in the main picture is 102,000; the inset picture has a molecular weight of 91,000, producing slightly smaller domains. The spacing between domains has been confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering, a technique which gives information about microstructure.Since most polymers are incompatible with one another, forming a block polymer will usually result in phase separation, and the principle has been widely exploited since {{the introduction of the}} SBS <b>block</b> <b>polymers,</b> especially where one of the block is highly crystalline.

The tendency of <b>block</b> <b>polymers</b> containing {{two or more}} immiscible segments to undergo microphase separation and form periodic, compositionally pure domains on the nanometer length scale makes these types of materials attractive {{for a variety of}} applications. Through the judicious choice of the constituent chains, <b>block</b> <b>polymers</b> with desirable properties can be fabricated. In particular, this thesis will focus on using these types of materials a nanolithographic templates. We have employed two distinct strategies for the formation of nanoscale arrays: (1) incorporating etch-resistant segments directly into the block polymer, and (2) using external reagents that are resistant to etching as a mask for selected regions of the block polymer. The first half of this thesis will focus on the synthesis and use of <b>block</b> <b>polymers</b> containing both poly(lactide) (PLA) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) as nanolithographic templates.

40|$|<b>Block</b> <b>polymer</b> {{self-assembly}} typically translates molecular chain connectivity into mesoscale structure {{by exploiting}} incompatible blocks with large interaction parameters (χ_ij). In this article, we {{demonstrate that the}} converse approach, encoding low-χ interactions in ABC bottlebrush triblock terpolymers (χ_(AC) ≲ 0), promotes organization into a unique mixed-domain lamellar morphology, which we designate LAM_P. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that LAM_P exhibits ACBC domain connectivity, in contrast to conventional three-domain lamellae (LAM_ 3) with ABCB periods. Complementary small-angle X-ray scattering experiments reveal a strongly decreasing domain spacing with increasing total molar mass. Self-consistent field theory reinforces these observations and predicts that LAM_P is thermodynamically stable below a critical χ_(AC), above which LAM_ 3 emerges. Both experiments and theory expose close analogies to ABA′ triblock copolymer phase behavior, collectively suggesting that low-χ interactions between chemically similar or distinct blocks intimately influence self-assembly.
