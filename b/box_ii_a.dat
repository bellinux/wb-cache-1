40|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 genome {{contains}} three origins of replication: OriL and a diploid OriS. The origin-binding protein, {{the product of the}} UL 9 gene, interacts with two sites within OriS, box I and <b>box</b> <b>II.</b> <b>A</b> third site, box III, which is homologous to boxes I and II, may also be a binding site for the origin-binding protein. Mutations in these three sites significantly reduce OriS-directed plasmid replication measured in transient replication assays. The reduction in replication efficiency of the mutants correlates well with the decrease in the ability to bind to the origin-binding protein, as determined by Elias et al. (P. Elias, C. M. Gustafsson, and O. Hammarsten, J. Biol. Chem. 265 : 17167 - 17173, 1990). The effect of multiple mutations in boxes I, II, and III on plasmid replication suggests that there are multiple binding sites in OriS for the origin-binding protein. These studies indicate that proper interaction of the origin-binding protein with the OriS sequence is essential for OriS-directed DNA replication...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken {{to provide an}} understanding of the nature, origin and desorption mechanism of species found on the porous silicon (PS) surface and the changes that occur when PS is stored under varying conditions. The PS used in this work was produced from p-, high-resistivity FZ c-Si substrates. Three types of commonly used HF-based electrolytes were chosen for anodisation, under the same process conditions. With the resulting samples, temperature programmed desorption (TPD) coupled with mass spectrometry were used to identify species liberated at different temperatures. FTIR was also used to investigate the nature of surface species on PS and hence to infer how these give rise to the observed volatile products. After various modifications, the TPD system with the custom-made heating unit and the appropriate methodology were developed to suit the present work. Freshly anodised PS in the vacuum chamber at room temperatures gave somewhat enhanced peaks due to air components (0 ⁺, N₂⁺ and/or CO⁺, O₂⁺ and CO₂⁺) and, most significantly, an increase in F-containing species (e. g. F ⁺), derived from the electrolyte. On heating, the main desorbed species were found be hydrogen, silane, Si-Fx species, and Hx-Fx species. TPD spectra for hydrogen showed two peak maxima with a "hump". This implies two types of hydrogen environments; these were assigned as Si-H (lower temperature peak) and Si-H₂ (higher temperature peak) species on the PS surface. The temperature difference between the two peaks was similar (100 K) in all three cases. This shows that hydrogen desorption occurs similarly from PS prepared using the three different electrolytes. It also suggests that hydrogen adsorption during PS formation occurs analogously in the three electrolytes. Silane was observed to desorb at 575 K. It is proposed that this comes from -SiH 3 groups on the PS surface, possibly after reaction with sorbed water. A mechanism is suggested. In contrast, desorption of Si-Fx species was found {{to be sensitive to the}} nature of the electrolyte. The lower temperature peaks from the TPD experiments are assigned to H₂SiF₆, SiF ₄ and perhaps H₂SiF₂ (by-products from anodisation) sorbed on PS. They are held relatively weakly by electrostatic and/or van der Waals forces. The higher temperature peak assigned to SiF₃ + may be explained in terms of migration of F atoms followed by Si-SiF₃ bond breakage. The various Hx-Fy products derive from species present in the HF electrolytes. To investigate changes in PS under typical storage conditions, samples were kept in (i) a blue wafer <b>box,</b> (<b>ii)</b> <b>a</b> screw-top white box and (iii) a similar box in a vacuum desiccator. The PS was then analysed by FTIR after various time intervals. After one month, only PS stored under condition (iii) was unchanged. The other samples showed evidence of oxidation, attributed to hydrolysis, fonnation of silanol (SiO-H) species, and back-bond oxidation of Si-Hx groups. Further ageing revealed inclusion of C-H species on PS. This work is a contribution to understanding of PS behaviour, and is relevant to its applications in electronic devices and sensors...|$|E

Previous studies demonstrated that the bZIP protein RF 2 a is involved in transcriptional regulation of the RTBV promoter. Here we report the identification and functional characterization of a second bZIP protein, RF 2 b. RF 2 b, identified by its interaction with RF 2 <b>a,</b> binds to <b>Box</b> <b>II</b> in in vitro assays as a homodimer and as RF 2 a/RF 2 b heterodimers. Like RF 2 a, RF 2 b activates the RTBV promoter in transient assays and in transgenic tobacco plants. Both RF 2 a and RF 2 b are predominantly expressed in vascular tissues. However, RF 2 a and RF 2 b have different DNA-binding affinities to <b>Box</b> <b>II,</b> show distinctive expression patterns in different rice organs, and exhibit different patterns of subcellular localization.

We used a four-plasmid replication-deficient PFV vector system, with uncoupled RNA genome packaging and structural protein translation, to analyze the effects of deletion and various substitution mutations within each GR box on particle release, particle-associated protein composition, RNA packaging, DNA content, infectivity, particle morphology, and intracel-lular localization. The degree of viral particle release by all mutants {{was similar to that}} of the wild type. Only minimal effects on Pol encapsidation, exogenous reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, and genomic viral RNA packaging were observed. In contrast, particle-associated DNA content and infectivity were drastically reduced for all deletion mutants and were undetectable for all alanine substitution mutants. Furthermore, GR box I mutants had significant changes in particle morphology, and GR <b>box</b> <b>II</b> mutants lacked the typical nuclear localization pattern of PFV Gag. Finally, it could be shown that GR boxes I and III, but not GR <b>box</b> <b>II,</b> can functionally complement each other. It therefore appears that, similar to the orthoretroviral Cys-His motifs, the PFV Gag GR boxes are important for RNA encapsidation, genome reverse transcription, and virio...|$|R

40|$|In higher plants, plastid {{genes are}} {{transcribed}} {{by at least}} two types of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. One {{of them is the}} well-known plastid-encoded prokaryotic type of polymerase that recognizes � 70 -type promoters consisting of � 35 and � 10 consensus elements. The other recently recognized RNA polymerase {{has been found to be}} encoded entirely in the nucleus, and it recognizes a completely different set of promoters, designated previously as nonconsensus type II (NCII) promoters. Here, we report the development of an in vitro transcription system using nonphotosynthetic plastids of cultured tobacco BY- 2 cells. This system preferentially and accurately initiates transcription from NCII promoters. The conditions for in vitro transcription were optimized by using the tobacco PatpB- 290 promoter, which has been found to be the most highly expressed NCII promoter in vivo. Analysis of in vitro transcription initiation in a series of PatpB- 290 5 � deletion constructs revealed that sequences upstream of nucleotide � 41 do not influence the transcriptional activity of this promoter. A 43 -bp region (nucleotides � 35 to � 8) was further analyzed by introducing single or multiple nucleotide substitutions into two regions (box I and <b>box</b> <b>II)</b> of high sequence conservation. We report here that the ATAGAA sequence comprising <b>box</b> <b>II</b> and the � 11 to � 4 region (relative to transcription initiation) in box I significantly influence the activity of this NCII promoter...|$|R
