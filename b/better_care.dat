Kid Nichols remarked in 1902 that Stivetts' speed was as fast as Rusie, and could have extended his career much longer had he taken <b>better</b> <b>care</b> of his body. Baseball writer O. P. Caylor wrote that Stivetts' issues were entirely his own, blaming his hard-drinking lifestyle and his inability to remain in good condition.|$|E

His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay {{a vote on the}} <b>Better</b> <b>Care</b> Reconciliation Act. Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, which is a very aggressive brain tumor. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain is a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.|$|E

During this time she lost her virginity to Hartono, an act which is viewed as {{unacceptable}} in traditional Indonesian culture; when Hartono left her, Tini became increasingly aloof and distant from men.

After learning of Tono's infidelity and seeing that Yah could take <b>better</b> <b>care</b> of him, Tini leaves her husband and moves to Surabaya.|$|E
5|$|While {{the society}} is matrilineal, it is not matriarchal. In past monarchies of the state, {{the son of the}} {{youngest}} sister of the king inherited the throne. Even now in the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly or village councils or panchayats the representation of women in politics is minimal. As of 2013, in a Meghalaya Legislative Assembly of 60 members, there are only four women. In the male centric Dorbar Shnong, which is the basic political arm of the tribes, women are not permitted to hold office. However, women feel that they take <b>better</b> <b>care</b> of money matters than men and they enjoy economic freedom.|$|E
5|$|There is {{one case}} study on maltreated twins {{published}} in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins {{between the ages of}} 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements. The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with <b>better</b> <b>care</b> but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.|$|E

25|$|According to the Flexner Report, Hopkins {{has served}} as the model for American medical education. It was the first medical school to require its {{students}} to have an undergraduate degree and was also the first graduate-level medical school to admit women on an equal basis as men. Mary Elizabeth Garrett, head of the Women's Medical School Fund, was a driving force behind both of these firsts. Sir William Osler became the first Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins and the first Physician-in-Chief at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Osler was responsible for establishing the residency system of postgraduate medical training, where young physicians were required to reside within the hospital to <b>better</b> <b>care</b> for their patients.|$|E
25|$|Further {{examples}} of Townshend's drug rehabilitation activism {{took place in}} the form of a 1984 benefit concert (incidentally the first live performance of Manchester band The Stone Roses), an article he wrote a few days later for Britain's Mail on Sunday urging <b>better</b> <b>care</b> for the nation's growing number of drug addicts, and the formation of a charitable organisation, Double-O Charities, to raise funds for the causes he'd recently championed. Townshend also personally sold fund-raising anti-heroin T-shirts at a series of UK Bruce Springsteen concerts and reportedly financed a trip for former Clash drummer Topper Headon to undergo drug rehabilitation treatment. Townshend's 1985–86 band, Deep End, played two benefits at Brixton Academy in 1985 for Double-O Charities.|$|E

He was {{resident}} in Ireland in 1579, when his father joined the later rebellion against the crown, and at that time his mother chose to deliver him to Sir William Drury, lord deputy of Ireland, who placed him in custody in Dublin Castle. In August 1582, his mother complained bitterly to Lord Burghley that her son's education was being neglected and sought <b>better</b> <b>care</b> for him. After the death of his fugitive father, FitzGerald's gaolers made petition to the English government for his removal to the Tower of London. The petition was granted in 1584, and {{before the end of the}} year he was removed to the Tower, where he remained for the next 16 years.|$|E
