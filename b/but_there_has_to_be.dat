500|$|The recut for BBC1 with Fry as host drew {{particular}} {{criticism as}} to whether its educational methods were suited to an adult demographic. History Today editor Paul Lay called the idea [...] "frightening". Historian and Labour Party MP Tristram Hunt, while admitting {{that he had not}} yet actually seen the programme, voiced his concerns that the show's content was not [...] "challenging and stimulating" [...] enough for the BBC, adding that [...] "For children, Horrible Histories is an exciting aid to engage with the guts and gore of the past, but there are more sophisticated, populist ways of getting people involved in history than this.

500|$|Oberman has {{described}} her {{time on the}} show as [...] "hectic". During Chrissie's tenure there was constant shuffling behind the scenes, with three different executive producers taking the reins, with each new producer bringing in new writing teams. Uncertainty came to be manifested in writing and scripts, with character inconsistencies and plot holes working their way into production. One notable example was ownership of The Queen Victoria, with Chrissie legally owner of half the pub after Den legitimately signed over the deed before they renewed their vows in February. However, in November this fact was forgotten, with Chrissie represented as forging Den's signature to nullify her ownership of the pub which legally became Sharon's. Problems with the script did not escape Oberman, who criticised her character's storylines after she left the show, saying the writers [...] "must have been on crack", adding how [...] "plots didn't make logical or emotional sense – but they said, 'That's the soap convention, dear, get used to it'". She also considered some scenes to be irresponsible, saying [...] "I was worried when four-year-olds said to me, 'I saw you kill Den.' I don't agree with censorship <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a level of responsibility." ...|$|E

The onus is upon the regime, as the party holding the reins of power, to engage. Without this, the country will continue to drift, as divided and fractured as ever, with a charter and a new electoral system being imposed, and the constitution abrogated to allow the implementation of both. The implications, both internally and internationally, hardly bear thinking about. The tragedy is that many beneficial features in both the proposed charter and the electoral system would be discounted because of the manner of their implementation.|$|E

50|$|Any QUICK, QUIZ, or QTP {{programs}} could be run compiled (converted to machine language) or uncompiled (source code). Compiled programs generally ran faster, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{be a good}} method to modifications to the source code so as to not corrupt the object code. QUICK screens were used primarily for data entry, and could call other QUICK screens, QUIZ reports, or QTP applications to update data.

For example, the GO command to run the source code was equivalent to the BUILD command to generate the compiled code.|$|R

Space-based Staring Infrared Sensors can detect the heat of rocket launching motors.

These stairs were wide enough to accommodate eight people abreast; so that if a large carriage load of visitors arrived, none of them need delay in crossing the fence. At the outside of the steps ran the narrow road which entered the plantation a quarter of a mile away, and passed around the lawn and the garden to the barns and stables at the back.|$|R

50|$|The press {{house and}} the corning house men also had {{important}} jobs in their own way. In pressing moisture from the gunpowder, the press house men <b>had</b> <b>to</b> ensure a uniform quality in the powder and doing this depended on obtaining ‘press cake’ of equal density and hardness. When the press cake went to the corning mill, grains of various sizes were produced, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be consistency amongst the different grain sizes. This was {{the task of the}} corning house men. Due to the large quantities of dust produced in the process, the powder was then taken to the dusting house where excess dust was removed by sieving.These were the most important skills directly involved in the manufacture of gunpowder.

50|$|At {{position}} R, different hydrocarbon {{groups were}} placed. None {{of them were}} more toxic than NRB, so a different strategy was tried. In a second study there has been looked at different ring analogues of NRB. None of these different ring analogues were proven more toxic than NRB.Another type of reaction that has been studied, is the making of prodrugs. These prodrugs were synthesized in order to overcome bait shyness. The goal {{of the study was}} creating a prodrug that tasted better than NRB and was, once it had entered the body, metabolized to NRB. Three different starting structures were used, seen in figures 4.2;4.3 and 4.4. In figures 4.5 and 4.6 it is shown how the starting structures were synthesized out of NRB. Only compound 19 (figure 4.7) was promising, because it delayed to onset of symptoms and it is more palatable to rats (shown in figure 4.8), <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> some more research on this compound before it can be used.|$|E
