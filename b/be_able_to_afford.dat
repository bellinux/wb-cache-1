5|$|Fred Keenor {{was born}} in Cardiff, Wales, as one of eleven children. He {{was raised in the}} family home, a terraced house in Theodora Street in Roath, a suburb in Cardiff, by his father Robert Keenor and his mother Mary. His father worked as a stonemason in the city, working long hours in order to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> the {{employment}} of Elizabeth Maler, a live-in nanny, to help his wife care for their children. Although they were not regarded as being in poverty, the family lived in cramped conditions, Keenor sharing a bedroom with three of his brothers in a house which did not have an inside toilet.|$|E

5|$|The Free State {{was happy}} to take over Abir's {{concession}} as the State had built up sufficient income to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> to run tax collections by itself. In addition the Free State was embarrassed by the continuing allegations of atrocities caused by Abir and it could institute reforms more effectively if it were in control. Leopold authorised the takeover {{in the hope that}} the Free State would be able to resume rubber collection and exports and on 12 September 1906 an agreement was signed which stated that all profits from the concession would go to the Free State in return for payment to Abir of 4.5 fr per kilogram of rubber harvested until 1952. Leopold told Abir's shareholders that he expected exports to return to normal levels within two years. To restore control the Free State dispatched a force of 650 men and 12 European officers under the command of Inspector Gerard to the concession. They returned four months later, leaving some areas still rebellious and with news that there were almost no rubber plants left. As a result, the quotas expected per man were cut to just 6kg of rubber per year, with some struggling to find even that much. State income was therefore negligible whilst the costs of controlling the concession continued to increase. Throughout this time Abir was still making a profit by taking its share of the rubber exported for almost no expenditure.|$|E

25|$|Whilst advising {{that further}} studies {{in lots of}} {{different}} eusocial and non-eusocial taxa are required to better assess the validity of these assumptions, Meunier notes {{that the existence of}} a trade-off between personal and social immunity could be masked or erroneously 'discovered' in a population/species due to individual variation (e.g. low-quality individuals may not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> relatively high investment into both immune systems), and thus recommends that the intrinsic quality of individuals should be controlled for if valid conclusions are to be drawn.|$|E

25|$|According to Colwell, {{the quality}} and {{inclusiveness}} of a country's health care system affects the control of cholera, {{as it did in}} the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak. While sanitation practices are important, when governments respond quickly and have readily available vaccines, the country will have a lower cholera death toll. Affordability of vaccines can be a problem; if the governments do not provide vaccinations, only the wealthy may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> them and there will be a greater toll on the country's poor. The speed with which government leaders respond to cholera outbreaks is important.|$|E

25|$|It {{was during}} this period that {{advances}} {{were made in the}} development of buses that improved their reliability and introduced innovations such as the pneumatic tyre. The Board, which by this time had come to the realisation that it would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> to significantly extend the tramway network, purchased some additional buses to provide services in areas not served by the trams. These developments also led to the rise of the private bus operators, which were able to provide services in areas not covered by the Board, and later to directly challenge the Board itself. After introducing a number of measures to directly combat the private operators, legislative means were employed to deal with them.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of the Preston curve {{has been used by}} Lant Pritchett and Larry Summers to argue that poor countries should focus on economic growth, and that health improvements will come about spontaneously as a result of increases in income. According to these authors, in 1990 better economic performance could have prevented {{more than half a million}} child deaths worldwide. However, the upward shifts of the Preston curve still imply that the main portion of gains in life expectancy has come about as a result of improved health technology rather than just increases in per capita income. Preston did, however, acknowledge that in the poorest countries economic growth may be necessary for improvements in health, as even the most inexpensive technologies have a cost of adoption that poor countries may not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford.</b>|$|E
