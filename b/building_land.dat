The situation of previously evicted tenants, now reduced to landless labourers, was also on their agenda.|$|E

In the central airport terminal, the Beuth University of Applied Sciences will establish the scientific core of the new technology park, with up to 2,500 students. It is envisaged that the adjoining areas will be used both for research and development and for manufacturing companies. Berlin TXL will also make an 80 hectares area available for industrial uses – the largest single inner-city development area in Berlin.|$|E
25|$|The Stanford family's {{influence}} grew in {{the nineteenth}} century as they acquired more land in strategically important places around Brighton and Hove: they were able to control the two towns' expansion by choosing when to sell land and stipulating how it would be developed. The rapid expansion of Brighton {{in the early nineteenth century}} made for high income from rents and William Stanford the elder made a steady income from the collection of fees for surrendering his feudal rights over <b>building</b> <b>land</b> on the Adelaide and Brunswick estates.

25|$|The area belonged {{previously}} to the Nazareth Congregation, {{the oldest}} in Wedding. Due to {{the high number of}} new parishioners moving in {{at the end of the}} 19th century the Nazareth Church grew too small. Count Eduard Karl von Oppersdorf, who purchased many grounds along Seestraße in order to develop them as <b>building</b> <b>land,</b> offered to donate a site for a new church and a considerable sum of money to build it. He considered a prestigious site on a square to be developed in Antwerpener Straße, but Berlin's planning and zoning board refused to approve that. Thus he offered the site on the crossroads of Seestraße #34/35 with Antwerpener Straße No.50 on the condition of starting the constructions until a certain date, otherwise the tendered money would be forfeited. Oppersdorf speculated for a rise of land prices by the establishment of a church in the area.|$|E
25|$|The site at Sutton Bonington {{continued}} to grow during {{the latter part of}} the 20th century, during this period the two initial faculties were merged into one: the faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences. The end of the 20th century saw the faculty initially merged with the faculty of Biology to form the School of Biology. At the time this was seen as a move to transfer the biology department from University Park to Sutton Bonington, in a move designed to free up much needed <b>building</b> <b>land,</b> the university however denied that this was their motive. Shortly after the purchase of the new Jubilee Campus, the school was split into the School of life sciences (based at University Park) and the School of Biosciences (based at Sutton Bonington). This period also saw the construction of new Plant and Food science buildings at Sutton Bonington.|$|E
25|$|William Stanford the younger's {{complicated}} will {{prevented the}} selling of freehold <b>building</b> <b>land</b> but a subsequent Act of Parliament, the 1871 Stanford Estate Act, allowed Ellen to grant building agreements with the option to purchase the freehold within seven years at a price equivalent to the ground rent for twenty-five years, {{clearing the way for}} the transformation of the Stanford estate from agricultural lands to building sites. To offset the sale of land in Brighton, the Stanford estate trustees acquired freeholds in Wiltshire, Sussex, Middlesex and Croydon and leaseholds in London. In 1891 Vere and Ellen persuaded the trustees of the Stanford Estate to purchase his family's estates at Pythouse and Norton Bavant in Wiltshire. The profit made from this transaction enabled Vere and Ellen to purchase a yacht and a property on the island of Madeira called Quinta Vigia, where they began spending the winter months for the sake of Vere's health. He died there in 1894.|$|E

50|$|The Commissioner of the IRS {{claimed that}} the {{property}} inherited by Crane was the <b>building</b> and <b>land</b> itself, not merely the equity in the <b>building</b> and <b>land.</b> This position had the merit of comporting with the facts at hand: prior to selling the property, Mrs. Crane had been allowed depreciation deductions in excess of $25,000 on the building. Correspondingly, the Commissioner argued that Crane, through {{the sale of the}} <b>building</b> and <b>land,</b> received an amount equal to the net of the cash received in addition to the amount of debt assumed by the purchaser.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, Wellington was {{expanding}} rapidly, and, due to the city's hilly terrain, good <b>building</b> <b>land</b> was at a premium. When new residential developments were {{proposed for}} Kelburn, it was suggested that a cable car or funicular could be built to provide easy access. In 1898, a number of people prominent {{in the development of the}} residential subdivisions founded the Kelburne & Karori Tramway Company. The plan was to build a tramway between the city and Kelburn, and link it by carriage to Karori, a settlement on the far side of Kelburn. The company began purchasing land for the construction of the tramway, and negotiated with the Karori authorities for a new road (now Upland Road) to link the upper terminus with Karori. In 1898, the City Council granted permission for the venture, on condition that it had the option to purchase the operation at a later date. The location of Victoria University of Wellington was influenced by the company's offer of a donation of £1000 if the university were located in Kelburn, so students would patronise the car when travelling between the city and the university. Several of the Company investors like Martin Kennedy were supporters of Seddon, who stalled on releasing land on the alternative Mount Cook Gaol site for the university, although this site was widely supported in Wellington.|$|E
25|$|On {{the death}} of George Loddiges in 1846, the nursery {{business}} passed to his son Conrad Loddiges II (1821–1865), who found {{it increasingly difficult to}} negotiate a new lease from the land-owner (St. Thomas' Hospital), given the much higher prices the land could now command for housing development, due to London's growth into the surrounding countryside. Similarly, the part of the nursery that was owned by the Loddiges family in freehold, was becoming more valuable as <b>building</b> <b>land,</b> whilst losing its attractive countryside village setting. Conrad was involved with the display of ferns and terrariums for the Great Exhibition. The nursery closed in stages between 1852 and 1854 due to expiry of the lease from St. Thomas' Hospital. Conrad Loddiges II offered the whole of the exotic plant stock to Kew Gardens for a sum of £9000 (20 years earlier the collection was valued at £200,0000) but this was refused. Many rare plants were auctioned via Stevens auctioneers, including rare orchids sold to John Day who would later become famous as a botanical illustrator. Joseph Paxton purchased 300 palms and plants for the opening of the new Crystal Palace at Sydenham. The Illustrated London News of 5 August 1854 illustrated plumed horses pulling a giant palm tree through the City of London on its way to be prominently displayed by Paxton in time for the opening of the Crystal Palace by Queen Victoria.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the early}} 1980s Middlewich {{has seen a}} {{significant}} quantity of new housing development, initially in the Sutton Lane and Hayhurst Avenue areas.

[...] One of the latest developments is on the old silk works next to the Big Lock public house. In common with other local towns such as Holmes Chapel, Northwich and Winsford, people are attracted to Middlewich because of its good road links via the M6 motorway and the relatively low price and availability of suitable <b>building</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
