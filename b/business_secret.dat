I write this letter to you with the greatest reluctance, and I signified the same to your peasher, and declared that I would not write to you by any means. To this the peasher urged, that, if I did not write to his master, how could he know to whom he (the peasher) delivered the money, and what must his master think of it? Therefore I write you this letter, and send it by my servant Ramanah, accompanied by the peasher's servant, and it will come safe to your hands. After perusal, you will {{send it back to}} me immediately: until I receive it, I don't like to eat my victuals or take any sleep. Your peasher took his oath, and urged me to write this for your satisfaction, and has engaged to me that I shall have this letter returned to me in the space of twelve days.|$|E

50|$|Smith took up {{the study}} of {{bacteriology}} {{at the suggestion of}} his friend James Frederick Elliott, and did a large amount of research endeavouring to find a vaccine against the effects of snake bite. He collected a large number of venomous snakes which he handled himself when extracting their venom. Smith eventually {{came to the conclusion that}} it was bacteriologically impossible to inoculate against snake-bite, but while carrying out his investigations he collected a large amount of information about the relative virulence of the venom of Australian snakes. His most important research was in connection with anthrax. Louis Pasteur had discovered a vaccine, which, however, would not keep, and Smith after long experimenting found an effective vaccine which would keep for an indefinite period. This he treated as a <b>business</b> <b>secret</b> for many years, but a few months before his death he handed the formula to representatives of the New South Wales government. Smith also gave £10,000 to endow a 'McGarvie Smith Institute'. While making his investigations Smith travelled extensively in Europe and the United States and visited many laboratories. He was a man of great determination and remarkable personality. All his life he had a passion for work, but he spared time in his youth to become a good rifle shot.

5000|$|The recent {{proceedings}} in the Police Court conclusively {{prove that}} the cowardly and atrocious outrages in question have not been prompted by hunger or want; as, indeed, no one could ever have supposed they were who reflected upon their nature for a single moment. The eccentricity of crime is marvellous and certainly {{the conduct of the}} scoundrels who have now fallen into the hands of justice is as unaccountable as it is scandalous. So clumsily has everything been managed, so little attempt has been made to keep the illegal <b>business</b> <b>secret,</b> that one might almost suppose the object and design of the robbers was to be found out. The conduct of John Kerney before going to Prospect Village, his remarks to his sister-in-law, his open confession after his return, his production of the watches which he had stolen when away, and, in fact, his whole career, as head of a gang of ruffians, would seem like that of a madman, were not his sanity but too plainly demonstrated in other aspects of his conduct. But the worst feature of these outrages is their murderous ferocity. To take a watch, or a purse, though illegal and deserving of severe punishment, is nothing in comparison with the ever-ready recourse to murderous weapons, which stamps the characters of these men, or at least some of them, with the brand of deepest infamy. A bloodthirstiness for which no excuse or palliation can be offered is strangely mixed up with the general characteristics of a miserable pickpocket ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In 2005, an {{extensive}} taxonomy of threats for VoIP {{was published by}} a prominent industry group. Strangely, this taxonomy does not identify stegocommunication as a threat, even though many steganographic channels {{have been identified in}} VoIP protocols. To avoid such security gaps in the future, we argue that stegocommunication should be added to the traditional list of network threats: interruption, interception, modification, fabrication. The stegocommunication threat arises when the communication channel is purchased, provided, or supervised by anyone other than the communicating parties. We illustrate a stegocommunication threat to a business owner Charles. If Charles purchases a VoIP service for business-related communications by an employee Alice, then he faces the risk that Alice may undetectably communicate a <b>business</b> <b>secret</b> to an outside party Bob. In this insider-threat scenario, Charles can mitigate his security risk by installing a stegodetector. Index Terms—VoIP; Steganography; Security Model I...|$|E

40|$|Network {{virtualization}} {{is a new}} Internet paradigm {{which allows}} multiple virtual networks (VNets) to share the resources of a given physical in-frastructure. The virtualization of entire networks is the natural next step after the virtualization of nodes and links. While {{the problem of how}} to embed a VNet (“guest network”) on a given resource network (“host net-work”) is algorithmically well-understood, much less is known about the security implications of this new technology. This paper introduces a new model to rea-son about one particular security threat: the leakage of information about the physical infrastructure—often a <b>business</b> <b>secret.</b> We initiate the study of this new problem and intro-duce the notion of request complexity which describes the number of VNet requests needed to fully disclose the substrate topology. We derive lower bounds and present algorithms achieving an asymptotically opti-mal request complexity for important graph classes such as trees, cactus graphs (complexity O(n)) as well as arbitrary graphs (complexity O(n 2)). Moreover, a general motif-based topology discovery framework is described which exploits the poset structure of the VNet embedding relation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper initiates {{the study}} of {{adversarial}} topology inference with virtual network (VNet) embeddings in ISP networks. As an example, we sketch how to infer cactus graphs with VNet request complexity O(n). 1 Contribution Sketch An Internet Service Provider’s (ISP) network infrastructure properties often constitute a <b>business</b> <b>secret,</b> not only for a competitive advantage, {{but also because the}} discovery of, e. g., bottlenecks, may be exploited for attacks or bad publicity. Hence, providers are often reluctant to open the infrastructure to novel technologies and applications that might leak information. We raise the question whether today’s trend of network virtualization [1], can be exploited to obtain information about the infrastructure. Network virtualization allows customers to request virtual networks (VNets) on demand. A VNet defines a set of virtual nodes (e. g., virtual machines) interconnected via virtual links according to the specified VNet topology over a substrate network. In this paper we consider VNet requests which do not impose any location constraints on where the virtual nodes are mapped to. This flexibility in the VNet specification can be used by th...|$|E
40|$|In {{administrative}} proceedings, files o f a {{case are}} accessible {{only to the}} parties, their attorneys and other participants with the rights of a party. The scope of the duty to make the files accessible to the parties is determined first o f all by the notion “files of a case”, which may be interpreted in different ways.

Thus, it refers only to files which are, at a given moment, available, save for files protected as a state secret, files excluded {{for the sake of}} an important public interest. Public interest may be a reason for excluding files which contain a classified information. Accessibility of files which contain information constituting some other type o f secret protected by law (<b>business</b> <b>secret,</b> professional secret) is disputable.

Our main objectives were {{to develop a}} model for Web crawling, to study crawling strategies and to build a Web crawler implementing them. This section points out {{what we have done}} and what could be done as future work. The next section summarizes our contributions, Section 1. 2 describes some guidelines for future work, and Section 1. 3 discusses open problems for Web crawling. 1. 1 Summary of our contributions This thesis dealt with Web crawling from a practical point of view. From this point of view, we worked in a series of problems which appeared during the design and implementation of a Web crawler. We started by describing the topic of Web crawling and summarizing relevant literature on the topic. Although there are many studies about Web search, Web crawler designs and algorithms are mostly kept as <b>business</b> <b>secret,</b> with some exceptions. (Chapter??). Our model divides the problem of Web crawling into short-term and long-term scheduling. We ex-plained why this separation is possible and how we can exploit it for efficient Web crawling, by generating batches of pages using a long-term scheduling policy, and then re-ordering these batches to apply a short-term scheduling policy. The long-term scheduling is related to page quality, while the short-term schedulin...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to bring {{comparison}} of significant Open Source relational database systems and one proprietary system. The comparison of the systems consists of functional comparison according to the actual trends in relational database systems and furthermore on performance testing, which will show up how efficient are single systems during execution of various commands and for which situations {{it is appropriate to}} use them. This work can be divided to three parts.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{procedural}} fairness {{plays an important}} role in the enforcement of competition law, which must not only be effective but also fair. Thus, legal institutions should guarantee a proper level of protection of the values of procedural fairness. This paper is dedicated to the possible conflict between the guarantees of procedural fairness that find their expression in the right to be heard and in the protection of confidential information. Both guarantees, the right to be heard on the one side, and the protection of confidential information on the other, should be properly balanced. Unlike EU law, Polish legislation and jurisprudence proves to be inefficient in this respect. Article 69 of the Competition Act fails to show clearly what the limits of the protection of confidential information are in situations when the right to be heard of other parties of antitrust proceedings is at stake. Business secrets are predominantly protected over the right to be heard also in the jurisprudence of Polish courts. By contrast, the Competition Act does not seem to properly protect confidential information other than business secrets. Such situation poses a risk for the adequate level of protection of procedural fairness in Polish antitrust enforcement. Moreover, neither Polish legislation nor jurisprudence explains to companies what shall prevail in the case of a concrete conflict between the protection of business secrets and the right to be heard. An answer to this questions is needed seeing as proof of a competition law infringement which should be accessible to the parties, can at the same time constitute a <b>business</b> <b>secret.</b> ...|$|E
