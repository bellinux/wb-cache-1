5|$|This {{chelation}} is {{in contrast}} to the mechanism for formation of the over-addition product wherein collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate allows a second addition. The mechanistic conjecture on the part of Weinreb was immediately accepted by the academic community, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> 2006 that it was confirmed by spectroscopic and kinetic analyses.|$|E
5|$|Beer colour is {{determined}} by the malt. The most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts. Pale lager and pale ale are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel coke. Coke was first used for roasting malt in 1642, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> around 1703 that the term pale ale was used.|$|E

There were other madams ready to step into her shoes, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> Mother Douglas took over the King's Head in Covent Garden in 1741 that a brothel reappeared with a {{reputation}} to match that of Needham.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{there was}} serious {{flooding}} in Salford, {{caused by a}} bottleneck at {{a bend in the}} river at Strangeways, on the border with Manchester. Flooding had been a problem for hundreds of years, and, in 1946, {{the decision was made to}} straighten and widen the river to increase its capacity. Work started in 1951 <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> September 1970 that water first flowed through the Anaconda Cut. The total cost of the project was £2m.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the established church, a variety of Reformed denominations have been practised in Royton. The Religious Society of Friends were recorded as holding conventicles in Heyside in {{as early as the}} 1650s. A Baptist meeting place was erected in 1775. Congregational preachers regularly visited Royton, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> 1854 that a workshop was established in the town. Primitive Methodism was established in Royton in a room in a Royley building, with its first purpose-built church being erected in 1867.|$|E

5|$|McLaren's later cars {{abandoned}} Mallite {{in favour}} of conventional aluminium construction; the Ford and Serenissima engine also saw no further action. For 1967 BRM engines powered the M4B and M5A <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> the Cosworth DFV became available in 1968 that McLaren scored their first Formula One wins with the M7A. Herd stayed on designing all of these cars until he left for Cosworth in 1967. McLaren have since {{become one of the}} most successful teams in Formula One.|$|E
5|$|Protease {{inhibitory}} {{activity in}} blood plasma was first {{reported in the}} late 1800s, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> the 1950s that the serpins antithrombin and alpha 1-antitrypsin were isolated. Initial research focused on their role in human disease: alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency {{is one of the}} most common genetic disorders, causing emphysema, and antithrombin deficiency results in thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance art marks a {{cultural}} rebirth {{at the close}} of the Middle Ages and rise of the Modern world. One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> the demonstrations of architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic technique.|$|E

The men's standing triple jump event featured at the Olympics in 1900 and 1904, but such competitions have since become very uncommon, although it is still used as a non-competitive exercise drill.|$|E
5|$|After {{giving the}} {{impression}} that he wished to negotiate, Ivan Alexander, reinforced by Mongol cavalry, overwhelmed the smaller but better organized Byzantine army in the Battle of Rusokastro. The contested cities surrendered to Ivan Alexander, while Andronikos III sought refuge within the walls of Rusokastro. The war ended with Ivan Alexander meeting Andronikos and agreeing a peace based on the status quo. To seal the alliance, he betrothed his eldest son, Michael Asen IV, to Andronikos's daughter Maria (Eirene), the marriage eventually taking place in 1339. The Bulgarian emperor was now free to turn his attentions to Belaur, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> 1336 or 1337 that the rebellion in the northwest was put down.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{persistently}} programmed {{works that}} did not attract the public, Beecham's musical activities at this time consistently lost money. As {{a result of his}} estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune was strictly limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of £700 left to him in his grandfather's will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able to draw on the family fortune to promote opera.|$|E

5|$|Between 1900 and 1940, fishers were {{threatened}} with near-extinction {{in the southern}} part of their range due to overtrapping and alterations to their habitat. In New England, fishers, along with most other furbearers, were nearly exterminated due to unregulated trapping. Fishers became extirpated in many northern U.S. states after 1930, but were still abundant enough in Canada to maintain a harvest of over 3,000 fishers per year (see figure). Limited protection was afforded in the early 20th century, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> 1934 that total protection was finally given to the few remaining fishers. Closed seasons, habitat recovery, and reintroductions have restored fishers to much of their original range.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the most}} common events are the 100 metres hurdles for women, 110m hurdles for men and 400m hurdles for both sexes. The men's 110m has been {{featured}} at every modern Summer Olympics while the men's 400m {{was introduced in the}} second edition of the Games. Women's initially competed in the 80 metres hurdles event, which entered the Olympic programme in 1932. This was extended to the 100m hurdles at the 1972 Olympics, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> 1984 that a women's 400m hurdles event took place at the Olympics (having been introduced at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics the previous year).|$|E
5|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, a number of {{business}} entities had formed themselves into trusts, which dominated their industries. Trusts often sought to purchase or otherwise neutralize their competitors, allowing the conglomerates to raise prices to high levels. In 1890, Congress had passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–09) that serious efforts were made to break up or control the trusts. The dominant force in the oil industry was Standard Oil, controlled by John D. Rockefeller. Modern-day Exxon, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Sohio, Amoco and Continental Oil all trace their ancestry to various parts of Standard Oil.|$|E

5|$|Coenwulf {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury {{over the issue of}} whether laypeople could control religious houses such as monasteries. The breakdown in {{the relationship between the two}} eventually reached the point where the archbishop was unable to exercise his duties for at least four years. A partial resolution was reached in 822 with Coenwulf's successor, King Ceolwulf, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> about 826 that a final settlement was reached between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, who had been the main beneficiary of Coenwulf's grants of religious property.|$|E
5|$|Dugdale both {{transcribed}} the Boulogne {{agreement and}} made a reference to it, in a footnote in his 1675 Baronage of England. After this the document was absent from history writing for almost three centuries. Dugdale's footnote was mentioned by certain historians, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> 1965 that the document itself was again used as a source, when Noël Denholm-Young quoted a few lines from it in his History and Heraldry: 12541310. In 1972, J. R. S. Phillips printed a complete transcription of the Boulogne agreement in his book Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke 13071324.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th century, Dinefwr Castle {{was built}} by Lord Rhys. The castle and grounds were seized by Henry VIII in 1531, and the estate owners, who changed their family surname to Rice, {{subsequently}} had to buy back their property from the Crown. The family were elevated to the peerage of Great Britain as Baron Dynevor.
