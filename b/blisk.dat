These bladed disks {{are referred to as}} <b>blisks.</b> One of the objectives pursued under the EU sponsored AWFORS project is to test laser cladding for its suitability to restore damaged blades of titanium <b>blisks.</b> This paper describes details of the laser cladding process to manufacture conventional and blade-like specimens in the titanium alloy Ti 6242 and the characterization of build-up welds by evaluation of their microstructure, hardness survey and residual stress measurements.

40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{research}} on reduced-order modeling of bladed disks and integrally bladed disks (<b>blisks)</b> for predicting the mistuned vibration response. However, most work to date has focused on the lower frequency families of blade-dominated modes.

More-over, some reduced-order modeling techniques for mistuned <b>blisks</b> make use of simplifications inherent in lower frequency ranges and neglect complexities of higher frequency ranges. In this study, key challenges of higher frequency regimes are considered. Procedures are presented and evaluated for reduced-order modeling and mistuning identification of <b>blisks</b> at frequency ranges beyond the first few families of blade-dominated modes.

40|$|This work {{introduces}} novel reduced order modeling {{techniques for}} identification of small mistuning and the simultaneous modeling of {{large and small}} mistuning in large structures that are nominally cyclically symmetric. Mistuning, or deviations in cyclically symmetric structures, can cause {{dramatic changes in the}} forced response of a system. Turbomachinery <b>blisks</b> are an example of cyclic structures that are subject to mistuning. Mistuning can be caused by small or large deviations in manufacturing, wear, or damage. Many accurate reduced order models (ROMS) exist to predict the system response in the presence of small mistuning. These will be denoted as direct ROMs, or those ROMs that generate system response predictions given knowledge of the system. However, the growing use of <b>blisks,</b> makes it necessary to determine the mistuning levels using system level experimental data of the response. Enabling this is the use of a novel concept developed in this work and denoted as inverse reduced order models (IROMs), which are models carefully selected to enhance sensitivity to the parameters that need to be predicted. System modes are categorized and a process of surrogate data is used to systematically evaluate IROMs. Many ROMs which model small mistuning in <b>blisks</b> are only accurate for small frequency ranges and are untested in higher frequency ranges. However, it is also necessary to have a tool to identify mistuning in higher frequency ranges. This is a nontrivial step because blade mode families are no longer isolated and blade topology becomes increasingly complicated. An enhanced measurement point selection algorithm integrated with a surrogate data process enables the identification of mistuning at higher frequencies. Large mistuning modeling of <b>blisks</b> using ROMs is an important step to predicting the response of the system. The approach in this work makes use of modes solved using cyclic symmetry analysis to predict the pristine, rogue, and interface portions of the system. This allows for the ROM to be generated using only simple sector level calculations, thus enabling rapid generation of ROMs. This approach can be combined with small mistuning models to accurately model both small and large mistuning in <b>blisks...</b>|$|R
