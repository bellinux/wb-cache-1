Director Mike Mills had been working with Smith during his final years and described Smith's troubles and apparent recovery: [...] "I gave the script to him, then he dropped {{off the face of}} the earth [...] he went through his whole crazy time, but <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> done with the film, he was making From a Basement on the Hill and I was shocked that he was actually making music." ...|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{noted that}} Half-Blood Prince {{contained}} a darker tone {{than the previous}} Potter novels. The Christian Science Monitor reviewer Yvonne Zipp considered the first half to contain a lighter tone to soften the unhappy ending. The Boston Globe reviewer Liz Rosenberg wrote, [...] "lightness [...] slimmer than ever in this darkening series... a new charge of gloom and darkness. I felt depressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{two-thirds of the way}} through". She also compared the setting to Charles Dickens's depictions of London, as it was [...] "brooding, broken, gold-lit, as living character as any other". Christopher Paolini called the darker tone [...] "disquieting" [...] because it was so different from the earlier books. Liesl Schillinger, a contributor to The New York Times book review, also noted that Half-Blood Prince was [...] "far darker" [...] but [...] "leavened with humor, romance and snappy dialogue". She suggested a connection to the 11 September attacks, as the later, darker novels were written after that event. David Kipen, a critic of the San Francisco Chronicle considered the [...] "darkness as a sign of our paranoid times" [...] and singled out curfews and searches that were part of the tightened security at Hogwarts, as a resemblance to our world.|$|E
500|$|In a 1991 Canadian {{television}} interview, Love {{commented on}} the album's coarse musical structure. She said that since the band was from Los Angeles, the [...] "metal capital of the US", {{they thought they were}} making a [...] "pop record with an edge", and were surprised by people's reactions when they were told it was violent and extreme. Love also said, [...] "It was all about the expression of my experience. I was not coming from a black void; I was trying to create light... I was trying to heal." [...] In an interview with Spin magazine several years after its release, Love said that she was [...] "posing in a lot of ways" [...] with the album: [...] "It was the truth, but it was also me catching up with all my hip peers who'd gone all indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths. I'd done the whole punk thing, sleeping on floors in piss and beer, and waking up with the guy with the fucking mohawk and the skateboards and the speed and the whole goddamned thing. But I hated it. I'd grown out of it <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> seventeen." [...] In a 1994 interview with Kurt Loder, Love admitted to having been [...] "consciously self-conscious" [...] when making the record due to her feeling the need to compete with her peers at the time.|$|E

Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me {{into his office and}} had me drop my trousers... I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early...|$|E
2500|$|Clare Tyler (later Bates) was {{introduced}} by {{the executive producer of}} EastEnders, Leonard Lewis. Gemma Bissix was cast in the role. Reflecting on the casting process in 2001, Bissix said, [...] "I was nine when I started on EastEnders. I did drama classes after school and my mum took me to an audition. There were about 50 others. I read through the script and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> home they had phoned my dad to tell him I had the role. I was only supposed to be in it for three episodes, but it turned into five years." [...] It was her first acting job and she had received no formal training. In 2008, Bissix stated, [...] "that was my training [...] quite a lot of people [...] drama school, I was trained by EastEnders." [...] The character made her first appearance in July 1993 as the daughter of Debbie Tyler (played by Nicola Duffett), a love interest for an EastEnders regular, Nigel Bates (played by Paul Bradley).|$|E
