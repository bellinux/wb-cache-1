Therefore also convective overturn behind the shock is strengthened. A "soft" nuclear equation of state that causes a rapid contraction and a smaller radius of the forming neutron star and thus a fast release of gravitational binding energy, seems to be more favorable for an explosion.

The figure shows the energy transfer efficiency from photons to the spacecraft's kinetic energy {{as a function of}} β=v/c (the spacecraft velocity divided by the light velocity) in photon propulsion. As the spacecraft velocity approaches the light velocity (v ≈ c) the efficiency of photon propulsion approaches 100%. The lower solid curve in the figure represents the efficiency of conventional photon rocket or sail with photon recycling. The upper solid line represents schematically an example the efficiency of a recycling photon rocket, such as a PLT. At low β, the recycling rocket can have a high thrust amplification factor (in this example, ~3,000), however as β approaches 1, the amplification factor converges to 1 and the overhead of recycling is unneeded. Therefore, these rockets are projected to bridge the efficiency gap.

This circuit {{can be used}} in testing the regulation characteristics of power-supply circuits. especially switching power-converter circuits that are {{supposed to be able to}} provide acceptably high degrees of regulation in response to rapid load transients. The combination of this power-switching circuit and a known passive constant load could be an attractive alternative to a typical commercially available load-bank circuit that can be made to operate in nominal constant-voltage, constant-current, and constant-resistance modes. The switching provided by a typical commercial load-bank circuit in the constant-resistance mode is not fast enough for testing of regulation in response to load transients. Moreover, some test engineers do not trust the test results obtained when using commercial load-bank circuits because the dynamic responses of those circuits are, variously, partly unknown and/or excessively complex. In contrast, the combination of this circuit and a passive constant load offers both rapid switching and known (or at least better known) load dynamics.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} work on {{the high}} average power operation of pulsed diode-pumped solid-state lasers by using a laser configuration known as the bounce geometry. The bounce geometry has previously produced efficient, high power and high spatial quality laser outputs in continuous-wave, Q-switched and modelocked regimes. This thesis explores {{the capabilities of the}} <b>bounce</b> geometry for <b>power</b> scaling, shown using Nd:YVO 4 and Nd:GdVO 4 in both a passively Q-switched laser system and a variety of nonlinear mirror modelocked systems. The high gain experienced by Nd-doped gain media pumped at 808 nm has traditionally posed difficulties in producing stable passive Q-switching with Cr 4 +:YAG. By using a novel stigmatic design of the bounce geometry that experiences lower gain, but highly circular output, passive Q-switching with > 11 W of average power is produced, at a pulse repetition rate of 190 kHz. This is the highest output power ever achieved from a passively Q-switched Nd-doped vanadate laser to date. Nonlinear mirror modelocking is a passive modelocking technique that employs a χ(2) nonlinear medium in combination with a dichroic output coupler. The first nonlinear mirror modelocking of a bounce geometry laser is presented, obtaining 11. 3 W of average power and 57 ps pulse duration using a type-II phase-matched KTP nonlinear crystal. Using type-I phase-matched BiBO, shorter pulses of 5. 7 ps in duration are obtained at an average power of 6. 1 W. The nonlinear mirror modelocking technique is then applied to the stigmatic bounce geometry laser, obtaining a highly stable train of modelocked pulses with pulse duration 14 ps and an average power of 12 W, with high spatial quality output. Mixed vanadate lasers offer customisation of the laser fluorescence spectrum, but tend to experience lower gain than single vanadates. Using the mixed vanadate combination Nd:Gd 0. 6 Y 0. 4 YVO 4 in the bounce geometry, 27. 5 W of average power in continuous-wave operation is shown. This is the highest power of any mixed vanadate laser ever reported. By then applying the nonlinear mirror modelocking technique to the mixed vanadate system, 16. 8 W of average modelocked output power and a pulse duration of 12. 7 ps is obtained. This is simultaneously {{the first time that the}} nonlinear mirror technique has been applied to mixed vanadate gain media and the highest power of any modelocked mixed vanadate laser to date. Finally, power scaling of a nonlinear mirror modelocked Nd:GdVO 4 laser in the bounce geometry is achieved through use of the double bounce geometry design and through use of a high power pump diode. The system employing the high power pumping produced > 30 W of average power — world record power using the nonlinear mirror technique.
