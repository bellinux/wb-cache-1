5|$|In 1761 John Griffin {{published}} {{a letter in}} the London Chronicle recommending methods for entering the Camel estuary during rough weather, particularly while north-northwest winds were blowing and described the bolts and rings he had fixed to the cliffs to assist ships trying to enter the harbour. Mooring rings were still there in 1824, and around 1830, three capstans {{at the base of}} the cliffs and <b>bollards</b> along the cliffs, by which means boats could be warped safely past the bar were installed.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{final report}} {{determined}} that along {{the whole of}} the rocky coast between Land's End and Hartland Point, Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the coasting trade when the most dangerous north-westerly onshore gales were blowing. It noted that Padstow's safety was compromised by the Doom Bar and by the eddy-forming effect of Stepper Point. The report recommended initial expenditure of £20,000 to cut down the outer part of Stepper Point, which, in conjunction with the capstans, <b>bollards</b> and mooring rings, would significantly reduce the risk to shipping.|$|E
5|$|The village {{can also}} be {{accessed}} by boat. The River Great Ouse passes to the east, forming much of the village's eastern boundary, and there are mooring <b>bollards</b> inside the village boundary. A privately owned 1945 de Havilland Dragon Rapide, based at the Shuttleworth Trust's Old Warden airfield, passes over the village during sightseeing tours to Ely. A privately maintained light aircraft airfield is located at Bedwell Hey Farm in the village.|$|E
40|$|The <b>bollard</b> pull of a tug, {{offshore}} {{supply vessel}} or fishing boat {{is an important}} parameter from a contractual and commercial point of view. The <b>bollard</b> pull {{is defined as the}} mean exerted force at zero speed for a certain period of time. For the determination of the <b>bollard</b> pull the ITS 2002 <b>Bollard</b> Pull Trial Code is currently the standard [1]. In this Code are described the <b>bollard</b> pull trial conduct, the criteria and the corrections on the measured <b>bollard</b> pull for non-ideal conditions. The completeness and corrections applied in this Code, however, are disputable. A first exploration with systematic model tests to determine the corrections of varying water depth and distance to the quay on the measured <b>bollard</b> pull was conducted at MARIN in November 2013 [2]. The measured corrections were compared with the current Code. Corrections for tow line length and water depth according to the Code can be as high as 14 %. The model tests resulted in significantly lower corrections for water depth and tow line length as illustrated in the figure below. In the ITS 2002 <b>Bollard</b> Pull Trial Code is also stated that the aim is to start a discussion regarding <b>bollard</b> pull with an internationally accepted <b>bollard</b> pull as the ultimate goal. However, this has never resulted in a final standard. Currently, the <b>bollard</b> pull determination is interpreted differently even by Classification Societies. With the <b>Bollard</b> Pull Standard JIP the relevant parameters that can be of influence on the <b>bollard</b> pull will be investigated. The aim is to develop an improved method for the <b>bollard</b> pull trial and <b>bollard</b> pull determination which is generally accepted by all parties involved...|$|R

5|$|There is also {{a fallen}} {{standing}} stone known as the Broad Stone which measures 2 metres (6.6 feet) in length and which lies beside the road about 1.5kilometres (0.9 miles) {{to the west of}} the Nine Stones. As it was recorded in the 19th century it measured 3 metres (10 feet) in length, 2 metres (6 and a half feet) in breadth, and 0.6 metres (2 feet) in thickness. The monument was protected from passing cars by several <b>bollards</b> which were later removed by the highways authority, prompting statements of concern that the stone was unprotected in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plans were}} for twenty four cannons, captured from the French army at the Battle of Waterloo, {{to be installed}} around the base. In 1818 one brass and 15 iron cannons were transported from the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich to Exeter Quay, but they were never transported to the monument. After years of storage at Exeter ten were sunk into the ground as <b>bollards,</b> and the brass gun sold in 1837 for £64 to cover the storage costs incurred by the local corporation. In 1890, when four guns were requested for the monument {{as part of a}} restoration project, they were found to be naval cannons cast in Scotland dating from 1789, and never used at the Battle of Waterloo. Four cannons were eventually installed in 1910, surrounding the monument, but these were removed during the Second World War (1939–1945) for scrap metal to help the war effort. The need for scrap metal fell and they were eventually buried at Watchet. The one cannon remaining at Exeter was brought to the monument in 1977 and finally installed in 1984.|$|E

500|$|In 1989 or 1990, a San Francisco city worker dumped an unused granite <b>bollard</b> {{amid the}} monastery stones; the [...] tall <b>bollard</b> was once {{used as a}} traffic barrier. Some self-styled Hindu park users led by {{performance}} artist Michael Bowen, calling himself Guru Baba Kali Das, began to worship the phallus-shaped <b>bollard</b> as a lingam; they wrestled some of the monastery's stones into a religious circle, calling the circle Shiva Linga. The city sued to reclaim the area in 1993, but lost the battle in court. In January 1994 the city arranged to move the traffic <b>bollard</b> to Bowen's garage, serving as his temple. Bowen later offered the granite <b>bollard</b> for sale and admitted that the whole episode was a performance piece.|$|R

40|$|A ducted {{propeller}} {{is well known}} to offer significant advantages for <b>bollard</b> pull performance of tugboats. A study about nozzle and propeller shape has been done for a long time, and a Ka series propeller and a conventional 19 A nozzle is used ordinarily for a {{ducted propeller}}. In late years a demand of the energy saving becomes very high because of a remarkable rises of the fuel oil price, and high <b>bollard</b> pull performance are demanded for tugboats at the same horsepower. Therefore, an improved design of a ducted propeller with high <b>bollard</b> pull performance is required. This present paper will describe the advanced design method of a ducted propeller which has high <b>bollard</b> pull performance. A nozzle section shape and a propeller are newly designed by a parametric study of the numerical simulation to have higher performance than a conventional ducted propeller. And the optimum arrangement between nozzle and propeller combination is studied. In order to confirm high <b>bollard</b> pull performance of the improved ducted propeller, the open water tests are carried out in a towing tank of Akishima Lavoratories (MITSUI ZOSEN) Inc. After {{the evaluation of the}} test results, the ducted propeller with high <b>bollard</b> pull performance is designed for actual tugboat. The newly designed ducted propeller is equipped for “Z-peller ” of Niigata Power Systems Co., Ltd as a propulsor of a tugboat, and the full-scale <b>bollard</b> pull test is conducted in the actual field. This paper will also present the field test results showing a higher <b>bollard</b> pull performance than the conventional ducted propeller...|$|R

25|$|The city started {{rebuilding}} the plaza in 2010, hiring {{the design and}} landscaping firm Snøhetta to permanently replace Broadway's roadway with custom-made granite pavers and benches. By December 2013, {{the first phase of}} the Times Square pedestrian plaza had been completed at the southern end of the square in time for the Times Square Ball drop on New Year's Eve. The project was originally intended to be completed by the end of 2015. The entire project was finally completed just before New Year's Eve 2016. Some safety <b>bollards</b> were also installed as part of the renovation in order to prevent vehicular attacks or collisions on the sidewalk. After a car crash that killed one person and injured 22 others on May 18, 2017, there were calls to install more <b>bollards</b> along Times Square.|$|E
