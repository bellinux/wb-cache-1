40|$|What are {{the core}} {{activities}} of the FSC? The FSC is an international non-profit organization that was founded in 1993 to introduce an international forest certification scheme and {{to act as an}} accreditation body. Forest certification is the process of inspecting particular forests or woodland to see if they are being managed according to an agreed set of strict ecological, economic and social criteria or standards. The FSC does not itself certify forest operations or manufacturers. These important activities are carried out by independent, FSC-accredited certification bodies in more than 30 countries. An important component of forest certification is product or chain-of-custody (CoC) verification. CoC is the process through which the source of a timber product is verified. In order to qualify for the FSC trademark, timber products must be traceable from the forest through all the steps in the production process until they reach the end user. The FSC provides producers with international labelling standards to facilitate this process. Over the past few decades, CoC labelling processes have greatly benefited from ICTs. How have CoC methods evolved? The oldest methods of wood labelling involved painting or chiselling company information and ID numbers onto a tree, or on one or both ends of a log. Such labels are commonly used in conjunction with paper records on tree or log species, dimensions and volume. More recently, ICTs are providing increasingly sophisticated means of labelling, as well as more efficient tools for tracking and storing additional information about timber products. The first major technological leap was the bar-coded label. Bar-coded data can be instantly read by a handheld scanner, stored electronically and transferred to a computer for analyses of stock inventories, for example. <b>Bar-coded</b> <b>labels</b> are increasingly being used to identify individual logs, particularly in countries that export high-value logs, and it is important to capture export revenues. Another key development has been the emergence of labels containing radio frequency identification (RFID) transceivers that receive and transmit data by radio signals. A handheld scanner can instruct any RFID label to transmit its data through a coded signal. The scanner may then be plugged into a computer and the data downloaded for further analysis. An important advantage of RFID systems for log tracking is that the data signals can be read rapidly, remotely and under difficult conditions. Also, RFID labels can store a large amount of data {{with a high level of}} security - they are difficult to counterfeit or tamper with. The tags come in a variety of forms, including plastic cards and tiny injectable transponders. On the down side, available radio frequencies vary from country to country, so there are currently no internationally standardized RFID technologies. What´s more, RFID labels are still too expensive for labelling individual logs and processed bundles of wood. What advanced technologies are now being used to capture data? CoC systems require careful documentation and record keeping, including files related to stock inventories and inspections, transport documentation, and retail and distribution records. The forestry industry has developed extensive databases to manage these records more effectively. Also, Global Positioning System (GPS) technology has had a major impact on this aspect of the CoC. GPS is commonly used in forest inventories to delineate the boundaries of forested areas and to determine field locations, but can also be used to track shipments of logs and timber products and to provide estimated delivery times. Microchip cards, or ´smart cards´, and magnetic strip cards are also very useful. These pieces of plastic can store large amounts of data and have built-in security features - they are ideal replacements for paper records and make the logistics of tracking timber products much more efficient. Finally, how is the FSC using ICTs to disseminate information? As an international network, the FSC relies on electronic communication to reach its 500 members and 33 national offices, in addition to annual face-to-face meetings. The FSC provides information in both Spanish and English to reach its stakeholders in the South, and has recently launched a new website and intranet. All relevant new developments are announced in the monthly FSC email newsletter News+Notes, which is sent to more than 4000 subscribers around the world. Moreover, the FSC has set up a hotline to answer questions, and has created a number of web-based forums so that stakeholders can more easily exchange information regarding the Council´s policies, consultations and other issues related to forest management. Taken together, these initiatives form part of a concerted, ongoing effort on the part of the FSC to increase awareness of the many benefits of forest certification - now and in the future. mailto:andra@fscoax. org Zandra Martinez is FSC media officer.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} an authenticated intrinsic-surf ace tagging method for unique- identification of controlled items. Although developed for control of items limited by an arms control treaty, this method has other potential applications to keep track of critical or high-value items. Each tag (unique-identifier) consists of the intrinsic, microscopic surface topography of a small designated area on a controlled item. It is implemented by making a baseline plastic casting of the designated tag area and usually placing a cover (for example, a <b>bar-code</b> <b>label)</b> over this area to protect the surface from environmental alteration. The plastic casting is returned to a laboratory and prepared for high-resolution scanning electron microscope imaging. Several images are digitized and stored for use as a standard for authentication of castings taken during future inspections. Authentication is determined by numerically comparing digital images. Commercially available hardware and software are used for this tag. Tag parameters are optimized, so unique casting images are obtained from original surfaces, and images obtained from attempted duplicate surfaces are detected. This optimization uses the modulation transfer function, a first principle of image analysis, to determine the parameters. Surface duplication experiments confirmed the optimization...|$|R
40|$|Although 1993 {{landings}} of lobsters were {{valued at}} $ 300 million in Canada and $ 210 {{million in the}} United States, postharvest losses are 10 - 15 % annually. "Bumper car" disease of lobsters caused by the scuticociliate Anophryoides haemophila, can be significant in coldwater impoundments. Although outbreaks occur more frequently and with greater severity, the epidemiology and economic impact of "bumper car" disease are not well documented. The ciliates are maintained in cell-free, defined medium at 5 degree C. Cultured ciliates require longer and more parasites to kill lobsters than those transmitted by intrahaemocoelic injection from lobster to lobster. Horizontal transmission likely occurs across gills of lobsters. Several licensed disinfectants and chemotherapeutants are efficacious against A. haemophila in vitro. Additional to indirect fluorescent antibody testing utilizing monoclonal antibodies prepared to sonicated ciliates, parasites are detected with oligonucleotide probes based on ssu-rDNA of A. haemophila. The prevalence of A. haemophila in wild-caught lobsters should be reevaluated with more sensitive and specific diagnostic tools.

40|$|Recent (1993) {{landings}} of American lobsters (Homarus americanus) were {{valued at}} $ 294 million (Can.) in Canada and $ 213 million (Can.) in the United States. However, post-harvest losses are estimated at $ 50 - 75 million (10 - 15 %) annually. The lobster fishery {{is one of}} the few remaining viable traditional fisheries in eastern North America. "Bumper car" disease of lobsters, caused by the scuticociliate Anophryoides haemophila, can cause significant losses in coldwater impoundments. Apparently epidemics now occur more frequently and with greater severity; surprisingly the epidemiology and economic impacts of "bumper car" disease are not well documented. The ciliate A. haemophila is easily maintained in a cell-free, chemically defined, seawater-based medium at 5 degrees C. Cultured ciliates require longer and more parasites to kill lobsters than those transmitted by intrahaemocoelic injection from lobster-to-lobster. Regardless of source of ciliates, the larger the inoculum, the more rapid the death of lobsters. The pathogenesis of "bumper car" disease is unknown. Horizontal transmission could occur across the thin cuticle of gills or via wounds in the exoskeleton present during moulting of lobsters. Because ciliates are initially sequestered in lobster tissues for an extended period, they are detectable sooner by histological examination of tissues than by direct examination or culture of haemolymph. Additional to indirect fluorescent antibody testing and immunoperoxidase staining of tissues, utilizing monoclonal antibodies prepared to sonicated ciliates, the parasites are readily detected with oligonucleotide probes based on ssu-rDNA of A. haemophila. The prevalence of A. haemophila should be re-evaluated. Ciliates sequester in gill, heart and muscle tissues. Several disinfectants and chemotherapeutants, licensed in North America for veterinary use in food-producing animals, are efficacious against A. haemophila in vitro.

40|$|Thesis (M. Consumer Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. All {{consumers}} {{engage in}} some form of grocery shopping in order to satisfy their most basic needs. During grocery shopping consumers tend to make their final decision about grocery purchases within the store. This increases the importance of the availability of in-store information. Shelf-edge labels can be viewed as informative point-of-purchase promotional material providing information, such as price. Since the implementation of <b>bar-coded</b> shelf-edge <b>labels,</b> the practice of individually pricing items declined, leaving the shelf-edge label often to be the only source indicating price and similar in-store information. The provision of in-store promotional and informational material can be associated with high costs and therefore needs to be optimised to its fullest potential. However, the use of shelf-edge labels by South African consumers is a question on the minds of retailers as well as consumer scientists, since an empirical research regarding this topic has been neglected in the past. Therefore, neither retailers, nor scientists know the extent to which consumers use shelf-edge labels during grocery shopping. Consumers' reasons for certain responses to or expectations of shelf-edge labels have not yet been properly investigated. This research aimed to answer these questions. The results of the study answered the study's objectives in a descriptive and exploratory manner, which {{led to the development of}} a conceptual frame. This conceptual frame provides a content specific decision-making model which indicates the use of shelf-edge labelling during grocery shopping. Retailers can use this model, as well as other results drawn from the study, to implement shelf-edge labels as informational material to its fullest potential. The study is furthermore beneficial to science in its ability to assist in the understanding of consumer behaviour. Master...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, {{consumer}} health and security {{are important and}} obligatory requirements for societal sustainability which are supported by a good traceability. For instance, textile and fashion product category is among top product categories contributing to high number of notified cases for product recalls in the European Union member states controlled by the RAPEX (Rapid alert system for dangerous non-food products) (Kumar and Ekwall 2016). These recalled products are generally non-compliant to the safety standards; therefore, they are potentially dangerous for the end-users. Although product recall {{can be regarded as}} a positive action, contributing to the removal of harmful products, the main issue arises in the recall execution as product identification and distribution is a complex task in the market. Textile products generally have similar characteristics, {{and it is difficult to}} identify them based on the vague specifications such as color or design. Furthermore, it is important that the surveillance authorities have relevant information of product distribution in the market so that recalled products can be efficiently tracked. In this context, experts propose using traceability system which maintains the data of product flow in the market (Directorate General Health and Consumers 2013). Moreover, as traceability works on the identification of products uniquely using labels including RFID tags, QR- and <b>bar-codes,</b> and printed <b>labels,</b> this helps in avoiding vague identification features, and the information encoded on the traceability labels contributes to product identification and organizing the product recall. In fact, traceability is a well-established tool in the food sector to ensure that all food items can be tracked throughout the supply chain to provide safe products to the consumers and to organize a targeted withdrawal (or recall) of food items which are identified as contaminated or not complying with permitted standards (Dabbene et al. 2014; Regattieri et al. 2007).|$|R
