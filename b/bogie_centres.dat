50|$|After the InterCity 250 {{project was}} scrapped, Virgin Trains, who have {{operated}} the InterCity West Coast franchise since the privatisation of British Rail, commissioned new rolling {{stock in the}} form of Class 390 electric multiple units, rather than the Class 93 locomotive and separate Mark 5 carriages proposed by British Rail. Network Rail track design standards previously used the Mark 5 coach to represent coaching stock with 19m <b>bogie</b> <b>centres,</b> however from June 2016 references to this requirement will be removed. Passenger Gauge 3 (PG3) with 17m <b>bogie</b> <b>centres</b> and 2.6m wheelbases is under development to replace this for future vehicles.|$|E
50|$|State Cars 2 and 3 {{were built}} in 1901 at Newport Workshops, and entered service on 30 April that year. The two cars were largely based on the {{existing}} V type carriage design, with a 50 ft body and 35 ft <b>bogie</b> <b>centres.</b> The main difference was the roof style, which was clerestory but with curved ends as would {{be applied to the}} later E type carriages. While under construction, official correspondence referred to the two vehicles as Royal carriages. After entry to service, State Car No.2 was named Alexandra and Stare Car No.3 was named Edward. The names appear on the carriage drawings centred above the windowline, but no photos exist of the cars to indicate whether they were applied.|$|E

5000|$|The {{intention}} of InterCity 250 {{was to build}} 30 full trains, each consisting of a Class 93 locomotive, nine 26 m long Mark 5 passenger coaches and a Mark 5 Driving Van Trailer. The coaches {{would be capable of}} 155 mph (250 km/h) and were specified to be equivalent in weight to the shorter Mark 4 coaches, which were felt to be overweight. The decision to increase the length of the coaches to 26 m from the 23 m of the Mark 4 was dictated by reduced maintenance costs following British Rail studies which indicated that such a length was feasible within the UK loading gauge. Indeed, during 1987 British Rail had considered increasing the length of the Mark 4 to 25.5 m (with 18.13m <b>bogie</b> <b>centres)</b> but the in-service date of 1989 and complexity of changing the design to suit caused the variation order to be shelved.|$|E
40|$|A 1 / 5 scale roller rig {{has been}} {{constructed}} {{for use in}} analysing the dynamic behaviour of railway vehicles. The roller rig includes a servo hydraulic system to allow a realistic input of track irregularities at the rollers and instrumentation is fitted to allow measurement of the position and acceleration of the bodies. This paper reports on the First stage in validating the behaviour of the roller rig using a relatively simple, linear computer model constructed in MATLAB. Initial results show good correlation between the behaviour seen on the roller rig and that predicted by the model.

25|$|Locomotives {{with total}} adhesion, {{where all of}} the wheels are coupled together, {{generally}} lack stability at speed. To counter this, locomotives often fit unpowered carrying wheels mounted on two-wheeled trucks or four-wheeled <b>bogies</b> <b>centred</b> by springs that help to guide the locomotive through curves. These usually take on weight – of the cylinders at the front or the firebox at the rear — when the width exceeds that of the mainframes. For multiple coupled-wheels on a rigid chassis, a variety of systems for controlled side-play exist.|$|R

50|$|As on the Class 7E, the locomotive's {{pantograph}} {{contact shoe}} centres are directly above the <b>bogie</b> pivot <b>centres</b> {{to reduce the}} possibility of pantograph hookups on catenary in sharp curves, such as in turnouts, {{as a result of}} sideways movement of the pantograph in relation to the overhead wire.|$|R
50|$|The second {{batch of}} 116 {{locomotives}} were delivered with tenders {{of which the}} underframe was modified. To improve the weight distribution, both <b>bogie</b> pivot <b>centres</b> were relocated 6 in towards the rear.

50|$|The Class 7E was {{the first}} SAR {{electric}} locomotive on which the pantograph contact shoe centres were located directly above the <b>bogie</b> pivot <b>centres.</b> This {{reduces the risk of}} pantograph hookups on catenary in sharp curves such as in turnouts as a result of sideways movement of the pantograph in relation to the overhead wire.|$|R
40|$|Track {{buckling}} {{has been}} considered as a major concern for Continuous Welded Rail (CWR) since the introduction of CWR on railway networks. Both static and dynamic loadings on track can cause track buckling. Track can be subjected to static loads such as tensile and compressive loads due to temperature differential, and misalignment due to maintenance operations and cumulative deflections. Dynamic parameters include vehicle loading on track under differenct speeds, Net Axle Lateral to Vertical (L/V) force ratio and <b>bogie</b> <b>centre</b> spacing. A number of research studies {{have been carried out}} to investigate the effect of different parameters of track buckling to establish a safety operating criteria. Railways around the world follow their own specific standards to safeguard against track buckling. However, all the studies differ in environment and operational characteristics. Hence unification of knowledge concerning different track buckling parameters is important. In the present study a comparative analysis of different parameters of track buckling is presented...|$|R
50|$|The bogie {{suspension}} system consisted of coil primary suspension, and flexicoil secondary suspension with anti-hunting and anti-rocking dampers. Tractive forces from bogie to locomotive were transferred via traction rods {{connected to a}} low lying connection at the <b>bogie</b> pivot <b>centre.</b> Mechanical braking was by wheel mounted disc brakes. Electric braking is either up to 4.5MW rheostatic braking via roof mounted resistors, or up to 7.2MW regenerative braking.|$|R
50|$|Some triple-bogied two-section {{electric}} locomotives {{such as the}} NZR EW class have an articulated body supported on the <b>centre</b> <b>bogie.</b> Other types of Bo-Bo-Bo locomotives instead use a body shell that has enough allowance for sideplay in the central bogie.|$|R
50|$|Like the {{subsequent}} Classes 2E, 3E and 4E, the Class 1E had bogie mounted draft gear. It had a Bo+Bo wheel arrangement with an articulated inter-bogie linkage, therefore no train forces were transmitted {{directly to the}} locomotive body. The <b>bogie</b> pivot <b>centres</b> were 6604 mm apart. One of the bottom pivot centres was fixed while the other was free to move longitudinally to allow for any wear occurring in the articulated coupling between the two bogies.|$|R
50|$|The {{rationale}} behind the design was that, if the tender frame could {{be carried on}} more points, represented by the rigidly mounted and Bissel wheels, instead of on only two <b>bogie</b> pivot <b>centres,</b> the frame could be made lighter. The vacuum cylinders which actuated brake blocks on the rigidly mounted wheels were mounted {{on top of the}} tank behind the coal bunker since the wheel arrangement left insufficient room to mount them under the frame as usual.|$|R
50|$|Transnet Freight Rail {{insisted that}} the {{locomotive}} should be designed {{in such a way}} that the pantograph contact shoe centres are directly above the <b>bogie</b> pivot <b>centres,</b> as was done on the Class 7E and Class 7E2, Series 1 and Series 2. The reason is to reduce the possibility of pantograph hookups on catenary in sharp curves, such as in turnouts, as a result of sideways movement of the pantograph in relation to the overhead wire.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, Verkehrsbetriebe Zürich (VBZ) took {{delivery}} {{of their first}} batch of 60 Tram 2000 vehicles, for use on the Zürich tram system. These metre gauge articulated bogie trams have two body sections supported on three <b>bogies.</b> The <b>centre</b> <b>bogie</b> supports the articulation and only the outer bogies are powered, an arrangement that is designated Be 4/6 in Switzerland. As VBZ's network has turning loops at all termini, the cars are single-ended (have a driver's cab at only one end) and single-sided (have doors on only one side). The car bodies were built by SWS, the bogies by SIG and the electrical equipment by BBC. Of the cars, 45 are of standard configuration whereas 15 have no driving cabs and are so suitable only {{for use as a}} second unit in a coupled pair. The name Tram 2000 derives from the numbering series applied to these trams, but also reflects the fleet modernisation their introduction heralded.|$|R
50|$|Transnet Freight Rail {{insisted that}} the {{locomotive}} must be designed {{in such a way}} that the pantograph contact shoe centres are directly above the <b>bogie</b> pivot <b>centres,</b> as was done on the Class 7E and Class 7E2, Series 1 and Series 2 and again on the Class 20E. The reason is to reduce the possibility of pantograph hookups on catenary in sharp curves, such as in turnouts, as a result of sideways movement of the pantograph in relation to the overhead wire.|$|R
50|$|The Type FT tender was {{an unusual}} type which used six pairs of wheels in a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement, with the leading and {{trailing}} wheels in Bissel-type pony trucks {{and the rest of}} the axles mounted with a rigid wheelbase. Like the leading and trailing wheels of the engine, all tender wheels were fitted with roller bearings. The rationale behind the design was that if the tender frame could be carried on more points represented by the rigid and Bissel wheels instead of on only two <b>bogie</b> pivot <b>centres,</b> the frame could be made lighter.|$|R
50|$|The trams {{have two}} powered FLEXX Urban 3000 <b>bogies</b> in the <b>centre</b> {{of the first}} and fifth cars and an {{unpowered}} set in the centre car. The tram utilises a 600 V overhead DC power supply, can negotiate a minimum curve radius of 25 m in service or 20 m on the depot and can tackle a maximum gradient of 6%.|$|R
50|$|The {{articulated}} {{units were}} in two-car sets comprising one motor car and one trailer car sharing a common <b>centre</b> <b>bogie.</b> The outer bogie of each motor car carried two electric traction motors. The passenger cars had bucket seats and manually operated sliding doors. The luggage compartments had double sliding doors. The motor parcel vans, which had four motors, {{were permitted to}} haul a load of up to 100 tons.|$|R
50|$|The tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 10 lt t, a water {{capacity of}} 5587 imp gal {{and a maximum}} axle load of 12 lt 10 lcwt kg. It had an unusual wheel structure of six pairs of wheels in a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement, with the leading and trailing wheels in Bissel-type pony trucks {{and the rest of}} the axles mounted with a rigid wheelbase. Like the leading and trailing wheels of its engine, all tender wheels were fitted with roller bearings. The rationale behind the design was that, if the tender frame could be carried on more points, represented by the rigidly mounted and Bissel wheels, instead of on only two <b>bogie</b> pivot <b>centres,</b> the frame could be made lighter.|$|R
50|$|The sets each {{consist of}} two semi-permanently {{connected}} cars mounted on three bogies. The outermost bogies are powered, with the <b>centre</b> <b>bogie</b> being articulated between both cars. The trains {{make use of}} resistive braking, with air-operated disc brakes for use during {{the final stages of}} deceleration. All bogies are equipped with a pair of magnetic track-brakes, which can be used to bring a train to a complete stand in as little as 150m from the maximum service speed.|$|R
5|$|The main {{hydraulic}} system provided pressure for undercarriage raising and lowering and <b>bogie</b> trim; nosewheel <b>centring</b> and steering; wheelbrakes (fitted with Maxarets); bomb doors opening and closing; and (B.2 only) AAPP air scoop lowering. Hydraulic pressure {{was provided by}} three hydraulic pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An electrically operated hydraulic power pack (EHPP) {{could be used to}} operate the bomb doors and recharge the brake accumulators. A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.|$|R
50|$|The bogies were a {{fabricated}} steel design, with coil spring primary suspension. The traction motors and gearboxes (one per axle) were mounted to the bogie frame {{and connected to}} the wheels by a flexibly coupled quill drive. Traction links were connected to the bogie frame at a height of 200 mm above rail. The locomotive superstructure is supported on coil springs on a central swing bolster, and the <b>centre</b> <b>bogie</b> allows 200 mm of lateral movement to negotiate small-radius curves. Yaw dampers are also fitted.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} design of 100% low floor {{vehicles}} uses short carbody sections for the wheels and longer suspended sections. Examples {{of this are}} the Citadis and Combino. A similar, but somewhat older technique {{is one that has}} been developed by MAN. In 1990, it was the first 100% low floor tram. These trams are found in ten German cities (such as Bremen and Munich) and in the Swedish city Norrköping. In many other German cities there are trams with low floor between the outer bogies and single axle <b>bogies</b> under the <b>centre</b> section.|$|R
50|$|Classes E 91 and E 77 {{were very}} similar. The three-axle driven bogies had an inside frame. Each had a double motor driving its axles via a {{jackshaft}} and Winterthur diagonal side-rod drive (Schrägstangenantrieb). The superstructure was in three sections. The {{front and rear}} sections each had a driver's cab and an engine room and were fixed to the <b>bogies.</b> The <b>centre</b> section was suspended between {{the front and rear}} sections and was articulated. The gangways between the individual sections of the engine room were protected by bellows; there were no dividing walls. The Bavarian locomotives could be easily told from their Silesian counterparts by the additional front door between the two cab windows (see photograph, right, of the Bavarian E 91 11, parked up in AW Frankfurt as a stationary transformer for the test shop. Unlike the E 91.9, it had air vents that can be clearly seen along {{the lower half of the}} sides).|$|R
