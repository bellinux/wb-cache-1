500|$|The Greek Revival trim {{of the new}} hotel {{contrasted with}} the other eleven {{buildings}} of Chicago. The symmetry of its facade was typical to contemporary Greek Revival practiced on the East Coast. Juliette Kinzie, who came to Chicago from Connecticut in 1831, described it as [...] "a pretentios white two-story building, with bright <b>blue</b> <b>wood</b> shutters, the admiration of all the little circle at Wolf Point". [...] The hostelry's clientele transcended race, with natives and settlers enjoying each other's company.|$|E
500|$|Popular {{fishing and}} hiking {{destinations}} in the volcanic field around Sawtooth Mountain include the Indian Heaven Wilderness, which is rather popular {{for the high}} mountain meadows among its scattered volcanic peaks. The Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail passes north/south through the volcanic field and the Indian Heaven Wilderness, which {{is known for its}} many lakes and spectacular views of four nearby volcanoes: Mount Adams, Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Rainier. It also hugs the densely forested east side of Sawtooth Mountain, and in conjunction with the Sawtooth Mountain Trail, can be hiked in a loop beginning at the Sawtooth Trailhead. Wood Lake is {{to the west of the}} peak, and a spur trail (Wood Lake Trail) leaves the Pacific Crest Trail for the lake. [...] Major trails at Sawtooth Mountain are the Sawtooth Trail, which climbs up and skirts the upper west side of Sawtooth Mountain; and Wood Lake Trail, which descends west from the Pacific Crest Trail to the deep <b>blue</b> <b>Wood</b> Lake. The Pacific Crest Trail skirts the densely forested lower west side of the peak.|$|E

60|$|An {{hour earlier}} the man, to visit whom Thurston had {{undertaken}} an eight-league journey, had laughed {{in his face}} when he offered to drain a lake which flooded his ranch. Saying nothing, but looking grimmer than ever, Geoffrey had continued his weary journey in search of sustenance. He frowned as he flung himself down beneath a fir, for, shimmering like polished steel between the giant trees, the glint of water caught his eye, and the <b>blue</b> <b>wood</b> smoke curling over the house on a distant slope suggested the usual plentiful Colonial breakfast.|$|E
60|$|If {{the blue}} man {{astonished}} the travelers, {{they were no}} less surprised by his surroundings, for look where they might, everything they beheld was of the same blue color as the sky above. They seemed to have landed in a large garden, surrounded by a high wall of blue stone. The trees were all blue, the grass was blue, the flowers were blue, and even the pebbles in the paths were blue. There were many handsomely carved benches and seats of <b>blue</b> <b>wood</b> scattered about the garden, and near them stood a fountain made of blue marble, which shot lovely sprays of blue water into the blue air.|$|E
60|$|We {{crossed the}} river to the village where I had been so kindly {{received}} many years ago--to St. Louis. The place was little changed. The wind was stilled, the <b>blue</b> <b>wood</b> smoke curled lazily from the wide stone chimneys of the houses nestling against the hill. The afterglow was fading into night; lights twinkled in the windows. Followed by our servants we climbed the bank, Helene and I, and walked the quiet streets bordered by palings. The evening was chill. We passed a bright cabaret from which came the sound of many voices; in the blacksmith's shop another group was gathered, and we saw faces eager in the red light. They were talking of the Cession.|$|E

60|$|Not long ago, as I {{was leaving}} {{one of the}} towns of Switzerland early in the morning, I saw in the clouds behind the houses an Alp which I did not know, a grander Alp than any I knew, nobler than the Schreckhorn or the MÃ¶nch; terminated, as it seemed, on one side by a precipice of almost unimaginable height; on the other, sloping away for leagues in one field of lustrous ice, clear and fair and blue, {{flashing}} here and there into silver under the morning sun. For a moment I received a sensation of as much sublimity as any natural object could possibly excite; the next moment, I saw that my unknown Alp was the glass roof {{of one of the}} workshops of the town, rising above its nearer houses, and rendered aerial and indistinct by some pure <b>blue</b> <b>wood</b> smoke which rose from intervening chimneys.|$|E

60|$|The {{expedition}} wandered southward leisurely, and Dane {{grew more}} savagely sullen {{as they passed}} dripping forest and foul morass in safety, until at last he ordered his tent to be pitched one sunset, fully a {{hundred yards from the}} camp. The light was failing when he stood outside it looking about him with a curious suggestion of anticipation in his face. They had reached the southern fringe of the Leopards' country, and another week's march should place them in touch with French officials. The forest was comparatively open, the cottonwoods growing well apart; and gazing between the long rows of towering trunks streaked by <b>blue</b> <b>wood</b> smoke, Dane could catch the shimmer of a sluggish creek. It was deep and miry, and haunted, as he had seen, by huge saurians, but a little produce evidently came down that way, for the bush path on either side was connected by a native ferry.|$|E
