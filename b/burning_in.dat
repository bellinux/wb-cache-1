Also, roadrunners become trapped outside the installed perimeter fences, where they become easy prey for coyotes, who have killed and eaten dozens of them since the facilities have been constructed.|$|E

5|$|According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Delhi was {{the most}} {{polluted}} {{city in the world}} in 2014. In 2016 WHO downgraded Delhi to eleventh-worst in the urban air quality database. According to one estimate, air pollution causes the death of about 10,500 people in Delhi every year. During 2013–14, peak levels of fine particulate matter (PM) in Delhi increased by about 44%, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions, construction work and crop <b>burning</b> <b>in</b> adjoining states. Delhi has the highest level of the airborne particulate matter, PM2.5 considered most harmful to health, with 153 micrograms. Rising air pollution level has significantly increased lung-related ailments (especially asthma and lung cancer) among Delhi's children and women. The dense smog in Delhi during winter season results in major air and rail traffic disruptions every year. According to Indian meteorologists, the average maximum temperature in Delhi during winters has declined notably since 1998 due to rising air pollution.|$|E

5|$|Fustat was {{the capital}} of Egypt for {{approximately}} 500 years. After the city's founding in 641, its authority was uninterrupted until 750, when the Abbasid dynasty staged a revolt against the Umayyads. This conflict was focused not in Egypt, but elsewhere in the Arab world. When the Abbasids gained power, they moved various capitals to more controllable areas. They had established the centre of their caliphate in Baghdad, moving the capital from its previous Umayyad location at Damascus. Similar moves were made throughout the new dynasty. In Egypt, they moved the capital from Fustat slightly north to the Abbasid city of al-Askar, which remained the capital until 868. When the Tulunid dynasty took control in 868, the Egyptian capital moved briefly to another nearby northern city, Al-Qatta'i. This lasted only until 905, when Al-Qatta'i was destroyed and the capital was returned to Fustat. The city again lost its status as capital city when its own vizier, Shawar, ordered its <b>burning</b> <b>in</b> 1168. The capital of Egypt was ultimately moved to Cairo.|$|E

Jason escapes, killing all but one of his captors, and slices through the cryo-chamber, spilling cryonics fluid into the room, freezing himself and the only other survivor, Rowan (Lexa Doig). A team of students 445 years later discover Jason's body. On the team's spacecraft, Jason thaws from his cryonic suspension and begins killing the crew. Along the way, he is enhanced by a regenerative nanotechnology process, which gives him an impenetrable metal body.

40|$|Aim of the study: To {{estimate}} {{and evaluate}} the influence of sociodemographic and environmental factors on children <b>burnings</b> <b>in</b> Kaunas region in 2000 – 2003. Methods: The research is carried out during 2000 – 2003. The data is taken from Kaunas territorial patient center. During the research the rate of children burning according sex, age and living place is analyzed. The distribution of burnings depending {{to the city and}} country as well as the patient age is surveyed, too. MS Excel and SPSS programs are used for the data analysis. Results: During 2000 – 2003, there were 2233 children(1365 boys and 868 girls) with various <b>burnings</b> <b>in</b> Kaunas region. In 2000 in Kaunas region 367, 5 boys and 225 girls suffered from burnings; in 2001 there were 408, 5 boys and 322, 9 girls with burnings for 100 000 region dwellers. In 2002 there were 360, 6 boys and 229, 8 girls with <b>burnings,</b> but <b>in</b> 2003 the number increased up to 494, 2 boys and 308, 1 girls with burnings. The total number of injured boys is 1365 (61 %) and the total number of injured girls is 868 (39 %). The largest number of burnt children is stated in the group of 0 - 6 years(1249 – 56 %). In the group of 7 - 9 years the number of burnt children is 246 (11 %). 432 (19 %) children of 10 – 14 years old and 306 (14 %) children of 15 – 17 years old suffered from burnings. 323 (23, 7 %) boys and 211 (24, 3 %) girls suffered from arm and shoulder burnings. 195 (22, 5 %) girls suffered from leg burnings. The number is 5, 6 % higher than the number of analogous <b>burnings</b> <b>in</b> boys group: 231 (16, 9 %) boys suffered from leg burnings. But even 6, 8 % more boys suffered from eye burnings (226 (16, 6 %) boys and just 85 (9, 8 %) girls). 	Conclusions: During 2000 – 2003, the number of children <b>burnings</b> <b>in</b> Kaunas region was increasing. Boys are subjected to burnings more than girls. The largest number of <b>burnings</b> is stated <b>in</b> the age group 0 - 6 years, comparing to 7 - 9 and 15 – 17 years age groups. Children living in country suffer twice as many from head and neck as well as from leg <b>burnings</b> and living <b>in</b> towns more often suffer from eye burnings...|$|R

5|$|S. g. ashbyi, (critically endangered), {{the western}} Victorian pied currawong, was {{described}} by Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews in 1913. It is threatened by hybridization with the neighbouring subspecies nebulosa whose range is expanding westwards. A 2000 estimate placed the number of breeding birds at around 250. It resembles subspecies nebulosa, with sooty plumage, a long tail and a short bill. There is some doubt over whether ashbyi, which is little known, is a distinct subspecies or a colour morph of nebulosa. It {{is thought to have}} evolved after the two populations became separated by basalt plains in western Victoria, with the return of trees after the abandonment of regular Aboriginal <b>burning</b> <b>in</b> the late 18th century contributing to the remixing of populations.

5|$|The Southern Railway {{operating}} department undertook trials to improve fleet efficiency.

The experiment also proved that pulverised coal was a false economy, as much of the fine dust was sucked through the chimney without combustion taking place.

In 1947 the class became a test-bed for a government-backed scheme regarding fuelling arrangements in anticipation of a coal shortage.
