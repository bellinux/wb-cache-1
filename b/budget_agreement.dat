40|$|U. S. Navy surface {{combatant}} requirements progressively dropped from 238 in 1988 to 116 in 1998. This reduction {{was part of}} the U. S. military transformation in the post-Cold War period. This thesis examined the major factors that influenced the change in {{surface combatant}} planning since 1990, i. e. <b>budget</b> <b>agreements,</b> naval doctrine, OPNAV reorganization, and Defense reviews. Data sources included books, periodicals, major force structure reviews, naval strategy papers, budgetary reports, and interviews. The major conclusion is that constrained fiscal resources had the most dramatic effect on the surface combatant fleet. To adapt to the drop in O&M and procurement funding, the Navy has reduced costs by decommissioning older ships, slowing shipbuilding rates, shifting to multiyear contracts, and focusing on life cycle expenses. The next scheduled surface combatant program, DD- 21, will compete against other shipbuilding programs due to projections of relatively flat Defense budgets. The shift to littoral warfare has also shaped the surface combatant force, changing doctrine and weapon system emphasis. NAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

40|$|Neither Congress nor the {{president}} {{is on the right}} track. Rather than protecting the surplus, we should be increasing spending and cutting taxes to contain the looming world recession. The United States has enjoyed a Goldilocks economy since the early 1990 s: robust growth, low unemployment, and low inflation. After much debate, many resolutions, historic <b>budget</b> <b>agreements,</b> and a strong equity market, the federal government finally managed to balance its fiscal 1998 budget (indeed, ran a surplus) {{for the first time in}} more than a generation. Predictably, a new debate [...] over "what to do with the surplus" [...] has emerged. Some policymakers favor tax cuts, others prefer debt reduction, and {{the president}} has advocated the rescue of Social Security. We argue that the budget surplus will be short-lived as the coming worldwide recession slows growth in the United States and lowers tax revenues. In our judgment the deficit reduction during the 1990 s played a significant role in depressing aggregate demand, which was offset only by unsustainable private sector borrowing. As the private sector in the United States becomes cognizant of declining equity markets, the spread of financial crises from Asia to Russia and Latin America, and falling world demand, it will be forced to reduce borrowing and repay loans. This will cause an economic downturn in the United States. While we applaud the Federal Reserve's recent timid moves to lower interest rates, we d...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} the {{financing}} mechanisms for graduate medical education (GME) in the United States. In so doing, we identify Medicare as the single largest contributor to GME {{and the most important}} barrier to producing a physician workforce that is appropriately sized, balanced, and skilled. Until passage of the 1997 <b>Budget</b> Reconciliation <b>Agreement,</b> the structure of Medicare payments promoted overproduction and skewed production toward training specialists in tertiary settings. We then examine the various reform proposals put forward by major health care organizations and policy bodies. These organizations generally agree on seven policy objectives: Remove incentives that promote expanded resident production; Base the GME subsidy on actual costs and distribute it more uniformly; Focus reductions on specialty residency positions; Provide GME payments for training provided in ambulatory, community, and managed care sites; Decouple Medicare GME reimbursement from payments to health maintenance organizations for patient care; Require all health insurers to contribute to GME; and Ensure that reductions in the GME subsidy do not reduce access to care for low-income persons. A myriad of different mechanisms for achieving these objectives have been recommended, many of which could be melded together to form a comprehensive approach to GME reform. The prospects for meaningful GME reform are dim in the absence of broader Medicare reform. The costs to stake-holders are too concentrated while the benefits to the public are too diffuse for GME reform to stand alone. But the political imperative to deal with the federal budget's short-term deficit and Medicare's long-term solvency will likely create an opportunity for GME reform. An addendum has been added that shows how the 1997 <b>Budget</b> Reconciliation <b>Agreement</b> addresses most of the major reform objectives identified but that several important issues remain unresolved...|$|R
