5|$|In modern society, merit-making {{has been}} criticized as materialist, but merit-making is still {{ubiquitous}} in many societies. Examples {{of the impact of}} <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> merit-making {{can be seen in the}} Phu Mi Bun rebellions which took place in the last centuries, as well as in the revival of certain forms of merit-making, such as the much discussed merit release.|$|E

The 'whether?' question: does perception provide us with reasons for <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> the external world? The 'how?' question: how does perception provide us with reasons for <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> the external world? The 'when?' question: when does perception provide us with reasons for <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> the external world? The 'what?' question: what are the reasons that perception provides us with for <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> the external world...|$|R

The population in this research consists of students of Tarbiyah Department of STAIN Kudus, Central Java. The sample was as many as study 242 students, taken through simple random sampling method. The data collection techniques used in this research was questionnaire {{in the form of}} scales and checklists. The data were analyzed using Structural Equation Models (SEM). The research resulted that epistemological beliefs as measured by <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> learning was negatively related on the constructivist conception of teaching and learning and) epistemological beliefs as measured by <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> knowledge was positively related on the traditional conception of teaching and learning...|$|R

5|$|Feminist economists {{often make}} a {{critical}} distinction that masculine bias in economics {{is primarily a}} result of gender, not sex. In other words, when feminist economists highlight the biases of mainstream economics, they focus on its social <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> masculinity like objectivity, separation, logical consistency, individual accomplishment, mathematics, abstraction, and lack of emotion, {{but not on the}} gender of authorities and subjects. However, the over-representation of men among economists and their subjects of study is also a concern.|$|E
5|$|James Morris {{notes that}} Hick's eschatological {{verification}} {{theory has been}} criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in religious pluralism. Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He argues that even if some <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in bodily resurrection can still be verified.|$|E
5|$|Medieval England was {{a patriarchal}} {{society and the}} lives of women were heavily {{influenced}} by contemporary <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> gender and authority. However, the position of women varied considerably according to various factors, including their social class; whether they were unmarried, married, widowed or remarried; and in which part of the country they lived. Significant gender inequities persisted throughout the period, as women typically had more limited life-choices, access to employment and trade, and legal rights than men.|$|E

5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.|$|E
5|$|In chapter five Goldacre {{suggests}} {{using the}} General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million patients, to conduct randomized trials {{to determine the}} most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, doctors would randomly assign patients to one or the other. The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind– patients would know which statin they had been prescribed– but Goldacre writes {{that they would be}} unlikely to hold such firm <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> which one is preferable {{to the extent that it}} could affect their health.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{knowledge}} of Egyptian <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> the gods is mostly drawn from religious writings {{produced by the}} nation's scribes and priests. These people were the elite of Egyptian society and were very distinct from the general populace, {{most of whom were}} illiterate. Little is known about how well this broader population knew or understood the sophisticated ideas that the elite developed. Commoners' perceptions of the divine may have differed from those of the priests. The populace may, for example, have mistaken the religion's symbolic statements about the gods and their actions for literal truth. But overall, what little is known about popular religious belief is consistent with the elite tradition. The two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of the gods and their nature.|$|E
40|$|Teachers {{and parents}} often {{complain}} about the negative affect of students on mathematics learning at schools, {{but there has been}} no official report on this matter. This study was intended to investigate the status of the affective aspect of the result of the schools mathematics education. The affects measured were attitude, interest, motivation, anxiety, self concept, extrinsic appreciation, intrinsic appreciation, operational appreciation, <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> mathematics, <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> self, <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> mathematics teaching, and <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> social context. The subjects were the first year students of the Faculty of Mathematics and Sciences of the State University of Yogyakarta (UNY) comprising students of eight departments i. e. Department of: Biology, Biology Education, Chemistry, Chemistry Education, Mathematics, Mathematics Education, Physics, and Physics Education. The instrument was adapted from the affective test items developed by Wilson used in the National Longitudinal Study on Mathematics Achievement by the School Mathematics Study Group in the USA, and supplemented by test items on beliefs developed based on the McLeod 2 ̆ 7 s classification. The data indicated that the affects were of either low level or neutral level (neither favorable nor unfavorable for mathematics lesson) except for the <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> mathematics, about mathematics teaching, and about social context of mathematics...|$|R

5|$|One {{approach}} is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more probable. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about what precise probability any given evidence justifies putting on the general statement. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> scientific theories are subjective, or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{articulated}} his own <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> {{religion as}} well. He did not {{subscribe to the}} view religious feeling was primarily a social need, believing {{it to be a}} need for seeing a cause and logic to the world along with a harmony to things. A believer in dualism, he held the theory of a separate biological psyche and something beyond it. To him the most important aspects of the psyche lay beyond objective science, at least in his time. He sought to explore those boundaries where the methods of science had to stop and declare what was beyond as unknown, limited by the tools of the times. In The Psychology of the Religious Life he laid out his definition of religion as an appreciative feeling toward an unseen entity marked the best or the greatest.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{were able}} to finish landing their troops, which {{may have contributed to}} the {{impression}} of significant forces in front of the Australian defenders and their subsequent withdrawal. The heavy losses suffered by the Allied aircraft and aircrew virtually eliminated their ability to influence the subsequent ground battles. Moran's report on Japanese incompetence at night fighting was the most important result of the battle. Since few details about the subsequent night combats off Java survived, Moran's assessment influenced Allied thinking about the IJN until the stunning victory during the nighttime Battle of Savo Island in August flipped the Allied <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> the Japanese ability at night fighting on their heads.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} East Texas Normal College (ETNC) {{comprises}} {{the history of}} the university now known as Texas A University–Commerce from its foundation as a private normal college in 1889 to its acquisition by the State of Texas in 1917. It was founded in Cooper by Kentucky native William L. Mayo, who served as its president from its foundation until his death in 1917, and moved to Commerce after its original campus burned down in 1894. A popular school for active teachers seeking state certification or recertification, it was largely shaped by Mayo's own personal <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> education, which focused on participation and hands-on learning instead of memorization or rote learning.|$|E
5|$|The {{roles of}} each deity were fluid, and each god could expand its nature {{to take on}} new characteristics. As a result, gods' roles are {{difficult}} to categorize or define. But despite their flexibility, the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence. Not even the creator god could reach {{beyond the boundaries of}} the cosmos that he created, and even Isis, though she was said to be the cleverest of the gods, was not omniscient. Richard H. Wilkinson, however, argues that some texts from the late New Kingdom suggest that, as <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> the god Amun evolved, he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence and to transcend the limits of the world in a way that other deities did not.|$|E
5|$|The spells of the Book of the Dead {{made use}} of several magical {{techniques}} which {{can also be seen}} in other areas of Egyptian life. A number of spells are for magical amulets, which would protect the deceased from harm. In addition to being represented on a Book of the Dead papyrus, these spells appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy. Everyday magic {{made use of}} amulets in huge numbers. Other items in direct contact with the body in the tomb, such as headrests, were also considered to have amuletic value. A number of spells also refer to Egyptian <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> the magical healing power of saliva.|$|E
