Adzes are used for smoothing or carving wood in hand woodworking, similar to an axe but with the cutting edge perpendicular to the handle. Two basic forms of an adze are the hand adze, a short handled tool swung with one hand, and a foot adze, a long handled tool capable of powerful swings using both hands, the cutting edge usually striking at foot or shin level. The blade of an adze is set at right angles to the tool's shaft (like a hoe or plane), in contrast to an axe's blade, which is in plane with the shaft. A similar, but <b>blunt,</b> <b>tool</b> used for digging in hard ground is called a mattock.|$|E

40|$|The multidimensional {{nature of}} poverty {{has long been}} acknowledged; even persons with {{sufficient}} financial resources {{may be unable to}} achieve satisfactory levels of well-being in other dimensions. However, traditional financial poverty analyses still play a predominant role in the formulation of poverty reduction strategies. In this paper we analyze the consequences of using financial poverty as a proxy for deprivation in the physical environment of children in the Republic of Congo by studying the degree of overlap between these dimensions. Our results indicate that incidence rates of poverty and deprivation differ substantially in magnitude; that high risk poverty characteristics do not necessarily correspond to high risk deprivation characteristics; and that the relation between poverty and deprivation in the physical environment is positive but not very strong. We conclude that using financial poverty indicators seems to be a <b>blunt</b> <b>tool</b> to identify vulnerable groups in the physical environment dimensions...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the federal}} {{government}} is traditionally understood to enjoy exclusive authority over immigration, states and localities are increasingly asserting a role in this field. This development has sparked vigorous debate on the propriety of such involvement, but the debate is predicated on a misunderstanding of the nature of federal exclusivity. Challenging the conventional wisdom that the Constitution precludes a meaningful role for state and local involvement in immigration. This Article argues that the Constitution allows immigration authority to be shared among levels of government. After establishing the correctness of this view of immigration authority, this Article argues that the constitutionality of state and local involvement should be assessed through the lens of traditional federalism values. A federalism lens does not necessarily validate any particular state and local regulation, but in lieu of the <b>blunt</b> <b>tool</b> of structural preemption, it is a far superior means for determining the proper allocation of immigration authority among levels of government, leading to a more nuanced assessment of the interests at stake...|$|E

40|$|I {{examine whether}} a benevolent {{government}} can improve {{on the free}} market allocation by setting capital requirements for private borrowers in a stochastic model with collateral constraints. Previous theoretical {{studies have found that}} when asset prices enter into bor- rowing constraints, pecuniary externalities between atomistic agents can make the laissez faire equilibrium constrained ine¢ cient. For reasonable parameter values, I find that, quan- titatively, the answer is 'no', private and government leverage choices coincide. Limiting private leverage by imposing capital requirements has the beneficial e¤ect of dampening the effects of the collateral amplification mechanism. This reduces fire sales in recessions and limits the negative externality that individual asset sales have on other credit constrained borrowers. However, we find that capital requirements are a <b>blunt</b> <b>tool.</b> They tax the activities of highly productive entrepreneurs and reduce the amount they produce in equilibrium. This reduces total factor productivity and steady state consumption. In the end, society faces a choice between high but unstable consumption in the free borrowing world and low but stable consumption in the regulated world. The government chooses the former. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{common law}} engages with social media {{in a manner}} that {{overlaps}} with defamation: seeking to balance the competing interests of free speech and protection of reputation. Employment law prompts a question as to how the law on this topic is developing. Adjudication of the concept of business reputation is the comparative focal point. Canadian employment law is developing a balance between protecting business reputation and workers’ free speech (though there are issues arising therein). In the UK, however, the term has been more of a <b>blunt</b> <b>tool.</b> As a result, a juxtaposition has arisen: speech in traditional media is better protected than that of workers using virtual social platforms. Using the contrasting case law as an example, the argument pursued here is that law must develop {{in a manner that}} establishes scope for remarks by workers on user-generated content platforms while protecting business reputation. To permit discipline for any form of social media remark would be inconsistent with the spirit of twenty-first century defamation law that has expanded protection for speech...|$|E
30|$|Shearing {{energy is}} easily quantifiable, {{and it is}} {{therefore}} tempting {{to use it as}} measure of suitable tool clearance. There was a slight minimum of the required shearing energy when shearing with parallel tools (Fig. 11). Most likely, shearing with rake angles also has an energy minimum; the energies decreases toward 0.20 h clearance, but 0.20 h was not large enough to show the increase in energy that likely follows at some larger clearance. The reliability of the data point at 0.20 h in the curve for 1 ° rake angle is questionable because of the stepwise fracture and unstable clearance for that combination of shearing parameters. Redundant experiments on that parameter combination showed a variation in shearing energy that was not seen for other combinations. Shearing energy is a <b>blunt</b> <b>tool</b> to select a suitable clearance, but at least clearances outside of the relatively wide clearance range with an energy minimum may be excluded as suitable clearances. A low energy is, however, not necessarily always beneficial: shearing with two clamps required more energy compared to one clamp, and Gustafsson et al. (2016) showed that two clamps resulted in better sheared surface characteristics.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{originating}} as practical aides for {{the design}} of real-world architecture, Computer-Aided Design and Draughting (CADD) software tools initially encountered a great deal of resistance, in part because of their initial expense and apparent technical complexity, but also because they were seen as <b>blunt</b> <b>tools,</b> crude instrumentation inadequate for the artistic expression of place. In March 2004, at an informal seminar hosted at the University of Melbourne in Australia, the eminent scholar Professor Marco Frascari argued that computer reconstructions of architecture were far too exact and thus too limited in conveying the mood and atmosphere of architecture. With all due respect to Professor Frascari, this article will argue the converse: that recent developments in interactive technology offer new and exciting ways of conveying ‘lived’ and experientially deepened notions of architectural place-making...|$|R

Furthermore, the influence of cutting-edge radius on the performance of PVD-coated carbide inserts has also been investigated experimentally and numerically. The simulation results from DEFORM 3 -D agree well with the experiment results from orthogonal cutting. Finally, some simulation results such as strain, strain rate and stress have been analyzed.
