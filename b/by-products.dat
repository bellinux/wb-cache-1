Fructose and the five-carbon sugars yielded the most bactericidal activity. Glucose concentrations of 1 % (wt/vol) resulted in a 99. 9 % decline in the CFU of stationary-phase cells per milliliter in 2 days at 25 °C.

Likewise, log-phase cells of the wild-type strain, 43895, were significantly more sensitive (P < 0. 001) to the glucose-phosphate <b>by-product</b> than were stationary-phase cells, which is consistent with the stability of rpoS and the regulation of rpoS-regulated genes. The bactericidal effect of the glucose-phosphate <b>by-product</b> was reduced when strains ATCC 43895 and FRIK 816 - 3 were incubated at a low temperature (4 °C).

Henri Dreyfus at British Celanese developed a methanol carbonylation pilot plant as early as 1925.
