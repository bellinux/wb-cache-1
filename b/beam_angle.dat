2500|$|Beam {{lights are}} often built {{much like the}} spot in terms of {{functionality}} aside from one key difference, beam lights use a wide lens to make an even more extreme beam. [...] A typical spot has a <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> from 15 to 35 degrees, whereas an average spot has a <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> of three to seven degrees with some high end companies producing lights with zero degree beams. [...] Such beam effects are less seen in the theatre industry and more in the club and concert industry.|$|E
2500|$|The field {{angle of}} an {{instrument}} is {{the angle of}} the beam of light where it reaches 10% of the intensity of the center of the beam. Most manufacturers now use field angle to indicate the spread that the fixture has. However, older fixtures are described by the width of the lens x focal length of the instrument. For example, a 6x9 ellipsoidal would have a 6" [...] lens and a focal length of 9" [...] (creating an approximately 37° <b>beam</b> <b>angle).</b> This nomenclature was used because traditionally a larger lens directly equated with more light output. This is no longer necessarily true, so most manufacturers now identify their fixtures by <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> and light output. As the field angle narrows, the instrument can either be used further from the stage to create a similarly-sized beam as a closer, larger instrument, or it can be used from the same distance to create a smaller beam.|$|E
40|$|The Io-Jupiter {{interaction}} generates strong decametric radio emissions (DAM), {{which appear}} as arcs in the time-frequency plane. These emissions are <b>beamed</b> at an <b>angle</b> from {{the magnetic field}} lines, which may vary with frequency and longitude amongst other properties. Empirical models of this <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> describe {{the shape of the}} DAM arcs and offer insight into the emission mechanism for DAM. Several studies have investigated the variation in the emission <b>beaming</b> <b>angle.</b> The studies span a range of frequencies which depend on the observational means (spacecraft, ground-based radio telescopes) used to obtain data. Subsequently, because of the varying assumptions made (e. g. relativistic vs. non-relativistic electrons for the wave polarization), methods used (e. g. prescribing a <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function vs. determining a <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function from observational geometry) and frequency ranges observed, different results have been found in each study. In the present paper, we model the shape of the emission with an empirical <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function and adjust the parameters to best fit the emission arcs. However, our model builds on previous models by taking into account the location of Io in the Jovian magnetic field. We also look at a broader frequency range than many of the intermediate studies. We find that a simple empirical <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function describes the shape of the A, B, and D arcs and that the <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function must decrease at high and low frequencies. We then propose a simple explanation for the <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> profile, deduced from cyclotron maser theory. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R
40|$|It is {{possible}} to obtain enhanced and directional beams using subwavelength metallic structures. However, the enhanced beams throughout such structures are only directed towards the propagation direction. In this study, we design the output surface gratings asymmetrically in order to steer the <b>beaming</b> <b>angle.</b> We use a metallic structure with a subwavelength slit (λ/ 10) and grating periods of 14 mm and 22 mm on different sides of the output surface. We demonstrate off-axis directional beaming in the microwave regime with an FWHM of 10 ° with a <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> of 15 °.

2500|$|Moving head {{fixtures}} {{are often}} divided into spot, wash lights and beam lights. They vary in use and functions, but many companies offer profile and wash {{versions of the}} same model of light. Profile lights generally contain features like gobos and prisms, whereas wash lights have simpler optics and a wider beam aperture resulting in wider <b>beam</b> <b>angle,</b> which may be altered by internal lenses or “frost effects”.

2500|$|ERS or profile {{lanterns}} {{have many}} useful features. One {{of the most}} useful are the metal shutters at the focal plane of the lens to shape the beam of light. The original shape of the beam is round, but {{with the use of}} the shutters one can limit the beam to avoid obstacles or parts of the set that should not be illuminated in a specific look. Another feature is a gate, also in the focal plane, for sliding in gobos (also known as templates or deckles). These have patterns cut into them, much like a stencil. These patterns are projected onto the stage. An iris can be also be inserted in this position to make the beam smaller in diameter, reducing the light cast without the sharp edges of the shutters. ERS instruments from ETC, Altman, Selecon, and a variety of others have interchangeable lens tubes (or barrels) which can both create a very sharp or very soft beam as well as alter the beam spread. The barrel sizes can range from a narrow, long distance 5- or 10-degree spot to a broad and short-distance 50- or even 90-degree. The first 90-degree profile lantern was developed by Selecon Performance Lighting as part of their [...] "Pacific" [...] range of products. Since its introduction many other manufacturers have introduced their own 90-degree barrels. ERS instruments allow many different lens tubes to be used with the same body. This makes them more versatile, since a venue can purchase varying degrees of barrels without buying as many instruments. Many manufacturers also produce zoom lenses which offer the ability to change the <b>beam</b> <b>angle.</b> Some zoom ranges have a poorer optical quality making them difficult to use in sharp focus.|$|E

40|$|Laser {{footprint}} {{size and}} <b>beam</b> divergence <b>angle</b> tuning {{was found to}} affect LiDAR data accuracy and measurement precision because of beam axis shifting. The laser <b>beam</b> divergence <b>angle</b> is generally tunable in modern LiDAR systems in order to adapt to different application scenarios. <b>Beam</b> divergence <b>angle</b> can either be switched from one position to the other (i. e. 0. 3 mRad / 0. 8 mRad), or be tuned continuously (i. e. 0. 3 to 0. 8 mRad).

As a result, the movements of mechanical parts make the optical axis shift and the laser pointing direction shift as well. In other words, switching laser <b>beam</b> divergence <b>angle</b> makes the laser pointing accuracy degrade.

Eight {{non-small cell lung cancer}} patients had pre-treatment (3) He MRI that was registered to inspiration breath-hold radiotherapy planning computed tomography. IMRT plans that minimised the volume of total lung receiving[*][*]⩾ 20 Gy (V 20) were compared with plans that minimised (3) He MRI defined functional lung receiving[*][*]⩾ 20 Gy (fV 20). Coplanar IMRT plans using 5 -field manually optimised <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and 9 -field equidistant plans were also evaluated. For each pair of plans, the Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to compare fV 20 and the percentage of planning target volume (PTV) receiving 90 % of the prescription dose (PTV 90). Incorporation of (3) He MRI led to median reductions in fV 20 of 1. 3 % (range: 0. 2 - 9. 3 %; p[*][*]=[*][*] 0. 04) and 0. 2 % (range: 0 to 4. 1 %; p[*][*]=[*][*] 0. 012) for 5 - and 9 -field arrangements, respectively.

40|$|Conventional beam {{orientation}} optimization (BOO) algorithms for IMRT {{assume that}} {{the same set of}} <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> is used for all treatment fractions. In this paper we present a BOO formulation based on group sparsity that simultaneously optimizes non-coplanar <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> for all fractions, yielding a fraction-variant (FV) treatment plan. <b>Beam</b> <b>angles</b> are selected by solving a multi-fraction FMO problem involving 500 - 700 candidate beams per fraction, with an additional group sparsity term that encourages most candidate beams to be inactive. The optimization problem is solved using the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm. Our FV BOO algorithm is used to create non-coplanar, five-fraction treatment plans for prostate and lung cases, as well as a non-coplanar 30 -fraction plan for a head and neck case. A homogeneous PTV dose coverage is maintained in all fractions. The treatment plans are compared with fraction-invariant plans that use a fixed set of <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> for all fractions. The FV plans reduced mean and max OAR dose on average by 3. 3 % and 3. 7 % of the prescription dose, respectively. Notably, mean OAR dose was reduced by 14. 3 % of prescription dose (rectum), 11. 6 % (penile bulb), 10. 7 % (seminal vesicle), 5. 5 % (right femur), 3. 5 % (bladder), 4. 0 % (normal left lung), 15. 5 % (cochleas), and 5. 2 % (chiasm). Max OAR dose was reduced by 14. 9 % of prescription dose (right femur), 8. 2 % (penile bulb), 12. 7 % (prox. bronchus), 4. 1 % (normal left lung), 15. 2 % (cochleas), 10. 1 % (orbits), 9. 1 % (chiasm), 8. 7 % (brainstem), and 7. 1 % (parotids). Meanwhile, PTV homogeneity defined as D 95 /D 5 improved from. 95 to. 98 (prostate case) and from. 94 to. 97 (lung case), and remained constant for the head and neck case. Moreover, the FV plans are dosimetrically similar to conventional plans that use twice as many beams per fraction. Thus, FV BOO offers the potential to reduce delivery time for non-coplanar IMRT...|$|R
