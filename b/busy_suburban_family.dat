In 1962 the east line was converted to standard gauge {{as part of the}} Melbourne to Sydney gauge standardisation project.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, 2-8-4 tender {{locomotives}} {{were designed}} mainly for passenger express trains, {{but they also}} hauled long distance express freights to increase utilisation. European 2-8-4 tank locomotives were a logical transition from the 2-8-2T locomotive types, allowing larger fireboxes and larger coal bunkers. They were mainly used for <b>busy</b> <b>suburban</b> services in heavily populated suburban areas of big cities, but infrequently also for sparsely populated rural areas or long distance lines.|$|R

Tourism plays an increasingly important role, providing jobs for local businesses.|$|R
50|$|The FAA {{has spent}} over US$3 billion on software, but a fully {{automated}} system is still over the horizon. In 2002 the UK {{brought a new}} area control centre into service at the London Area Control Centre, Swanwick, Hampshire, relieving a <b>busy</b> <b>suburban</b> centre at West Drayton, Middlesex, north of London Heathrow Airport. Software from Lockheed-Martin predominates at the London Area Control Centre.

50|$|Although media usually {{classify}} Gent-Wevelgem as a cobbled classic, {{the route}} actually has very few sections of cobbled roads. Only the Kemmelberg {{and the upper}} stretches of the Kasselberg are cobbled, totaling a possible maximum of two kilometres of cobbled section, which is significantly less than the other cobbled races of Flanders and Northern France. Moreover, there are no flat sections of pavé and both cobbled climbs are in excellent condition, as {{they are part of}} a <b>busy</b> <b>suburban</b> traffic network.|$|R
50|$|In 1963, voters {{approved}} by referendum in two jurisdictions {{to consolidate the}} remaining portions of Norfolk County with the much smaller city of South Norfolk; they chose the name of city of Chesapeake for the new independent city. Although organized as a city, {{and one of the}} larger in Virginia, Chesapeake has both <b>busy</b> <b>suburban</b> and industrial areas, and mostly rural sections. The latter includes {{a large portion of the}} Great Dismal Swamp and large tracts of preserved forest land.|$|R

50|$|With {{the coming}} of {{absolute}} block signalling, the class-based headcodes allowed signallers to identify and regulate trains properly. However on some busy lines, particularly <b>busy</b> <b>suburban</b> ones, the headcode denoted {{the route of the}} train rather than the class of train. In these areas junctions were complex and timetables were intense: it was more important that signallers routed the trains correctly than regulated trains by class. This was prevalent in the south of England, where companies used six headlamp positions to show the route of train.|$|R

25|$|No. 670, while {{introducing}} {{a number of}} innovations that would later become standard, was not authorised to carry standing passengers, and thus lacked the necessary capacity for use on <b>busy</b> <b>suburban</b> routes. It {{was to have been}} deployed on a Rangiora service for which its generous luggage accommodation would be useful, but deregulation resulted in the license for the Rangiora service being awarded to another operator before no. 670 was delivered. Consequently, it was never used in revenue service, and was sold after being used for a series of demonstration trips.|$|R
50|$|Shelters {{appear to}} have been built at large stations, <b>busy</b> <b>suburban</b> {{commuter}} stations, and stations which had refreshment rooms. The latter would have been a vulnerable target for aircraft while passengers were disembarked for a meal. Queensland Railways station plans indicate that at least 23 stations on the North Coast line between Brisbane and Cairns had refreshment rooms at some time before World War II. At least five of these stations, plus possibly Townsville, had one or more air raid shelters marked on post-war site maps. These stations were Caboolture, Landsborough, Maryborough, Gladstone, and Rockhampton.|$|R
