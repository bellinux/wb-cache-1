5|$|Amy Dumas {{was born}} in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on April 14, 1975. She {{attended}} many different schools throughout her childhood and adolescent years and managed to finish high school at Lassiter High School six months before graduation. She majored in education at Georgia State University, but dropped out in 1993 <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> {{it was too much}} like high school.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Mühe was married to his third wife, stage actress Susanne Lothar, and living in Berlin with her and their two children, Sophie Marie and Jakob. Mühe and Lothar starred {{together}} in Mühe's last film, Nemesis (2010), which deals with a couple's troubled relationship. However, Lothar, who died in 2012, launched a lawsuit to block the film from release for nearly three years, apparently <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that it would cast the couple in a bad light.|$|E
5|$|Coolbrith {{had hoped}} to tour the East Coast and Europe with Miller, but stayed behind in San Francisco <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> obliged {{to care for her}} mother and her seriously ill, widowed sister Agnes who was unable to care for herself or for her two children. In late 1871 she took on the care of another {{dependent}} when Joaquin Miller brought her a teenaged Indian girl (widely rumored to be his own daughter) to care for while he went abroad again, this time to Brazil and Europe.|$|E
60|$|Now they {{perceived}} {{that she was}} a true Princess, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> the pea through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down quilts.|$|R
50|$|Clarkson {{says that}} she made a {{conscious}} decision not to have children <b>because</b> <b>she</b> did not want to lose focus on her career., and <b>because</b> <b>she</b> never <b>felt</b> passionate about being a mother.|$|R
50|$|Ibargüengoita {{died in an}} {{airplane}} crash on November 27, 1983, in Spain, while Laville was at their home in Paris. She continued to live in Paris until 1985 {{when she returned to}} Mexico <b>because,</b> <b>she</b> said, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> at home there. She then went to live near Cuernavaca, bringing Jorge’s private library with her as well as his ashes. She kept them for fifteen years until she was convinced to inter them at the Parque Antillon {{in front of the house}} where he was born.|$|R
5|$|The {{artist has}} {{performed}} at political rallies led by Beck, and at campaign rallies for Herman Cain. Her husband joined Cain's presidential campaign as state director for Tennessee after hearing him speak at events where Branch performed. Branch said Cain {{was a natural}} choice {{for her and her}} husband <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> their beliefs aligned with Cain's. Since 2010, she received three payments that totaled $10,000 for live entertainment services provided at political rallies from several political action committees associated with Cain's campaign.|$|E
5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Haiko, {{the family moved to}} a rented house in Porvoo where, in August 1917, Victoria gave birth to Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia, her only son and the heir to the dynasty. The family {{remained}} in Finland, a former Grand Duchy under Russian rule, which had declared its independence in December 1917. They hoped that the White Russians would prevail. They gradually ran out of supplies and had to beg for help from family. In July 1918, Victoria wrote to her first cousin, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, begging her to send baby food so she could feed Vladimir. She was alienated from England <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> her English relatives had not done enough to help the Romanovs.|$|E
5|$|Harrelson was the season's next {{significant}} casting choice, {{brought on}} to play Hart at McConaughey's request. Harrelson stated that he joined True Detective partly {{because he wanted to}} work with certain people involved in the project, with whom he had previously collaborated in the 2012 HBO film Game Change. Michelle Monaghan agreed to play the season's female lead, Maggie, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> compelled by the direction of the plot and her character's story arc. Michael Potts and Tory Kittles completed the principal cast, playing detectives Maynard Gilbough and Thomas Papania, respectively. Major supporting roles in True Detective first season include Kevin Dunn as Major Ken Quesada, Alexandra Daddario as Lisa Tragnetti, and Brad Carter as Charlie Lange.|$|E
60|$|In {{all future}} conversations on the subject, Rosamond was mildly {{certain that the}} ride had made no difference, and {{that if she had}} stayed at home the same {{symptoms}} would have come on and would have ended in the same way, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> something like them before.|$|R
5000|$|After Spider-Man unmasked himself, the Black Cat was enraged <b>because</b> <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> {{that they}} shared a bond over knowing his identity, which she {{described}} as [...] "sexy". Though she is dating Thomas Fireheart (a.k.a. Puma), her new sexual interest notes that Felicia may still have some romantic inclinations toward Peter.|$|R
60|$|Romola's mind recoiled {{strongly}} {{from listening}} to this vision. Her indignation had subsided, {{but it was only}} <b>because</b> <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> the distance between her brother and herself widening. But while Fra Luca was speaking, the figure of another monk had entered, and again stood {{on the other side of}} the bed, with the cowl drawn over his head.|$|R
5|$|In April 2011, Lovato {{became a}} {{contributing}} editor for Seventeen magazine, writing an article that described her struggles. In March 2012, MTV aired a documentary, , about her rehab and recovery. She began work on her fourth album the following month. In January 2013, it was reported that Lovato had been living in a sober-living facility in Los Angeles {{for more than a year}} <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it was the best way to avoid returning to her addictions and eating disorder. Lovato celebrated the five year anniversary of her sobriety on March 15, 2017. Lovato also started training in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu since 2016.|$|E
5|$|Liukin {{decided that}} she was not done with {{gymnastics}} and made her first post-Olympics competitive appearance at the CoverGirl Classic, where she competed only on balance beam. She placed second behind teammate Ivana Hong. Liukin thought about competing uneven bars and beam at the U.S. Championships, but decided to once again just perform on beam. She placed fourth and looked on track to possibly make a fourth World Championships team. Liukin was added to the national team and included in the World Championships selection camp. However, she pulled out of Worlds selection consideration <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> {{that she was not}} quite up to World Championships standards.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Saydel High School in 1983, Robinson {{spent the summer}} {{deciding}} on her career path as {{she worked as a}} department store cashier. She went with her father to help him promote local races. Robinson persuaded him to let her compete in racing, and started off at Toledo Speedway driving a 1976 International semi-tractor. She participated in a five-lap sprint race where she finished second after leading for four laps, and took third position in the feature event. After this Robinson began racing full-time, and won 30 feature races before moving to the super-speedway division in April 1984; she faced early resentment from her male competitors. In the same year, Robinson moved from Iowa to Pennsylvania. Lefty believed Robinson's presence helped to increase fans' interest. Robinson's father acted as her mentor although her mother was against her racing <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> she would be hurt in a crash.|$|E
50|$|In an unaired scene {{available}} on the web, Trump gave Marilu Henners charity a $20,000 donation <b>because</b> he <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> deserved to win money for her charity.|$|R
50|$|Born in Evanston, Illinois, Ronnie Burns {{was five}} weeks {{old when he}} was adopted in Chicago September 27, 1935, by George Burns and Gracie Allen. His older sister, Sandra Jean, had been adopted the year before and was then 13 months old. According to George Burns, Ronnie {{had been the most}} sickly baby up for {{adoption}} from the agency, and Gracie chose him <b>because</b> <b>she</b> particularly <b>felt</b> he needed their help.|$|R
50|$|When Victoire de Rohan {{was to be}} {{replaced}} as Governess of the Children of France in 1782, de Duras, alongside Louise-Charlotte de Duras, was commonly assumed to be the two most suitable candidates for the post: however, Marie Antoinette refused de Chimay because of her too severe religiosity and de Duras <b>because</b> <b>she</b> reportedly <b>felt</b> a certain academic inferiority toward her, and chose Yolande de Polastron for the position instead.|$|R
5|$|Although Deal was the bassist of the Pixies, {{she wanted}} to play guitar for the Breeders, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it was an easier {{instrument}} to handle when singing at the same time. Deal recruited Josephine Wiggs of Perfect Disaster to be the Breeders' bassist; the two knew each other from when Perfect Disaster had toured with the Pixies in Europe in 1989. Deal wanted Steve Albini to record the album; she had previously worked {{with him on the}} Pixies' Surfer Rosa. She hoped to have Kelley Deal be the Breeders' drummer, but the latter was not able to take time away from her program analyst job. Albini suggested they try Britt Walford of the band Slint instead. Before recording began, Deal, Wiggs, and Walford rehearsed at Wiggs' house in Bedfordshire, England for a week, and then joined Donelly in London to practice more. Albini was involved in the pre-production of the songs, which Donelly found beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy {{that she could be}} based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends, as well as to I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that she would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always felt that she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Jovovich {{starred in}} the horror/action film Resident Evil, {{released}} in the United States on March 15, 2002 {{and based on the}} CAPCOM video game series of the same name. She portrayed Alice, the film's heroine, who fights a legion of zombies created by the Umbrella Corporation. Jovovich had accepted the role because she and her brother Marco had been fans of the video game franchise. Jovovich had performed all the stunts required in the film, except for a scene that would involve her jumping to a cement platform, which her management deemed too dangerous, and had trained in karate, kickboxing, and combat-training. The film was commercially successful, grossing $17 million on its opening weekend, and gaining $40 million domestically and $102 million worldwide. Later, she portrayed the manipulative gang wife Erin in No Good Deed (2002), Nadine in the romantic comedy You Stupid Man (2002), punk rocker Fangora ("Fanny") in Dummy (2003), and provided a guest voice on the television series King of the Hill. The role of Fangora in Dummy allowed Jovovich to act in film with Oscar-winning Adrien Brody, who was a friend prior to filming. Jovovich found it easy to identify with this role <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> Fangora possessed similar qualities to the actress' own life.|$|E
50|$|In an unaired {{scene from}} the {{television}} episode, Mr. Trump gave Sharon another donation of $10,000 to her charity <b>because</b> he <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> deserved to win more money.|$|R
60|$|It {{was unusually}} dark when Florence Hunter {{drove out of}} the {{settlement}} with her husband riding beside the wagon, and the roughness of the trail made conversation difficult. Florence was, on the whole, glad of this, <b>because,</b> although <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> {{that there was a}} good deal to be said, she could not express herself befittingly while her attention was concentrated on the team. Besides, she wanted to see the man and watch his face when she spoke to him.|$|R
60|$|She made {{a violent}} effort to control herself, and turning her tear-stained face to him, she once more {{held out her}} hand, which he kissed with the same punctilious gallantry; but Marguerite's fingers, this time, lingered in his hand {{for a second or}} two longer than was {{absolutely}} necessary, and this was <b>because</b> <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> that his hand trembled perceptibly and was burning hot, whilst his lips felt as cold as marble.|$|R
5|$|While at Princeton, she got {{involved}} with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group that supported minority students, running their day care center, which also included after school tutoring. She challenged the teaching methodology for French <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> {{that it should be}} more conversational. As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community. She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African American graduates, requesting they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded, and her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African American community, even though they had attended an elite university with all of the advantages that accrues to its graduates. She majored in sociology and minored in African American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{had wanted}} to make a horror game for eight years prior to Phantasmagoria, and had started to design one on several occasions, but none came to fruition. She felt the {{computer}} game industry and software technology had not yet reached the point where an effective and frightening computer game could be made. As a result, she decided to wait until CD-ROMs were faster and could handle real actors, which she believed was crucial for a horror game <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> the player {{had to be able to}} empathize with the character to fear for them. Williams had been considering several horror story ideas for years before making the game. In one, the heroine answers a magician's advertisement for an assistant and gets the job, but the magician turns out to be insane. Another was set in the past, with the female protagonist getting involved in the supernatural life of a magician character. That idea evolved into a woman being married to a man who is drawn to a bizarre house that previously belonged to illusionists and is haunted by ghosts. The final story as it appears in the game has a contemporary setting, but combines elements from modern fiction, 19th century literature, and classic horror films of the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In the manga Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Beveridge liked Sasuke's personality, {{particularly}} {{as it was}} presented during his dialogue with Naruto. Reviewing the anime adaptation, Sam Stewart from IGN was particularly impressed by the scenes between Sasuke and Sarada, most notably because of changes in Sasuke's characterization. He highlights that despite acting coldly towards his daughter, he ends up using his body as a shield {{to protect her from}} his enemy. Ken Iikura from Anime Now agreed, pointing out that Sasuke has become a loving husband and father in Boruto, despite retaining some of the dark aspects of his personality. Ikikura noted that Sasuke and Sarada's meeting in Boruto significantly developed both characters. McNulty disliked the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it was initially an one-sided crush on Sakura's part, but she believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden expanded on the bond between the two and their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Stewart praised Sasuke's portrayal as a flawed parent rather than an effortlessly good one, noting that his farewell to Sarada demonstrated his difficulty with being a good father. Another writer from Anime Now, Sarah Nelkin, noted that these episodes helped to develop Sasuke as both a father and a husband, especially when he explains to Sarada that she creates a bond between him and Sakura that persists despite his being frequently absent {{as a result of his}} mission.|$|E
60|$|A little encouragement, however, {{brought out}} {{the story of the}} phosphoric letters, the lions, and the vision of Maddox {{growling}} in the dressing-room. The date of the apparition could hardly be hoped for, but fortunately Rose remembered that it was two days before her mamma's birthday, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> it so bard to be eaten up before the fete, and this date tallied with that given by Maria of her admitting her treacherous admirer into the private rooms.|$|R
5000|$|Taylor's {{performance}} wasn't reviewed <b>because</b> <b>she</b> {{became ill}} {{and was taken}} to the hospital before group therapy in Episode 1 and returned after the challenge in Episode 2.Note: In episode 7, there was no hot seat, but Steve dismissed Arian from the house <b>because</b> he <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> wasn't learning anything from him or boot camp.|$|R
30|$|My {{father worked}} as the {{director}} of a school. Any evidence of Buddhism was strongly prohibited in my family – no Buddhist relics, books, even conversations on Buddhism were allowed. Because Buddhism has been maintained as a folk tradition, my mother secretly visited the datsan and lamas, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> always <b>felt</b> a need for spiritual and moral support. My father usually drove her on these visits to the datsan and waited for her outside, sitting in the car somewhere, so nobody could see him (Chodron 2016).|$|R
25|$|In October 1999, {{around the}} time Furnace Room Lullaby was released, Case left Seattle for Chicago <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that Seattle was no longer hospitable to its local artists.|$|E
25|$|Kidder {{appeared}} in two episodes of The CW television series Smallville as Dr. Bridgette Crosby, an emissary of Dr. Virgil Swann (played by Christopher Reeve). She declined {{to make a}} third appearance on the show after Reeve's death <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it would be doing his memory a disservice.|$|E
25|$|Chinese actor Huang Xiaoming {{publicly}} {{acknowledged that}} he had crush over Zhao Wei when he and she both attended the Beijing Film Academy. Zhao rejected his courtship <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> he was not mature enough. The two remain as close friends and have collaborated in the movie Hollywood Adventures, a joint Hollywood-Chinese production.|$|E
50|$|Rather than {{creating}} {{a foundation that}} would last into perpetuity, this team of four decided {{that they were going}} to spend all the money. The goal was to be out of money in ten years, but the money was spent in about four and a half. In an interview, Ms. Bernstein Ferry says that she wanted to spend all the money because they could know the needs of the present but not of the future and <b>because</b> <b>she</b> simply <b>felt</b> better as more of the money disappeared.|$|R
6000|$|The next morning, at breakfast, {{though her}} mother's {{complaints}} continued, Janet was silent as to her purchase, and she lingered on her return {{home in the}} evening <b>because</b> <b>she</b> now <b>felt</b> a reluctance {{to appear in the}} role of protector and preserver of the family. She would have preferred, if possible, to give the stove anonymously. Not that the expression of Hannah's gratitude was maudlin; she glared at Janet when she entered the dining-room and exclaimed: [...] "You hadn't ought to have gone and done it!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Kagedan {{trained and}} {{received}} ordination {{in the summer}} of 2015 from Yeshivat Maharat, the Orthodox women's religious training program founded by Rabbi Avi Weiss in Bronx, New York. Unlike other Maharat graduates, who assumed titles such as rabba (feminine version of [...] "rabbi") or maharat (manhiga hilchatit ruchanit toranit, or [...] "female leader of Jewish law, spirit and Torah"), Kagedan was the first to take the title [...] "rabbi", <b>because</b> <b>she</b> said <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that it was the most natural following her ordination.|$|R
