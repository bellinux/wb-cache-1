My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, <b>but</b> <b>somebody</b> could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E

500|$|Miguel {{introduces}} Dexter {{to former}} football player Billy Fleeter (Jeff Chase), a debt enforcer who kills other gamblers {{to pay off}} his own debts. Dexter is initially hesitant when Miguel suggests that Dexter {{teach him how to}} murder Fleeter, but the two go to a casino where Dexter tries to explain his deceased father Harry's (James Remar) [...] "code" [...] to Miguel. They later break into Fleeter's house and, although they find the murder weapon, Dexter says that they need evidence proving that Fleeter has the incentive to kill again. Dexter finds a ledger recording each of Fleeter's bets and he returns with Miguel to the casino where they prepare an unused storeroom for the murder. They arrange to kill Fleeter that night, <b>but</b> <b>somebody</b> recognizes Miguel in the casino and Dexter calls off the plan.
