40|$|ObjectiveThe study {{objective}} was to review our first 300 consecutive robotic-assisted mitral repairs performed from June 2005 to October 2012 and to compare the surgical outcomes of our previously reported initial 120 cases with the subsequent 180 procedures. MethodsOur initial 120 robotic-assisted mitral repairs were previously reported, and we now compare our early experience with the recent 180 consecutive procedures {{for a total of}} 300 robotic-assisted mitral repairs. There was no patient selection. Every patient in need of isolated mitral valve repair underwent this procedure. All patients received an annuloplasty band and 1 or more of the following: leaflet resection, secondary chordal transposition, or polytetrafluoroethylene neochordal replacement and edge-to-edge repair. ResultsAll 300 patients had preoperative echocardiographic findings of severe mitral regurgitation. There were no differences (P = not significant) between the initial and the recent cohorts for preoperative characteristics, including age (58. 4 ± 10. 5 years vs 59. 9 years), female gender (35. 8 % vs 36. 1 %), ejection fraction (61. 9 % vs 60. 6 %), congestive heart failure (35. 0 % vs 36. 7 %), creatinine (0. 94 mg/dL vs 0. 98 mg/dL), and New York Heart Association class. The incidence of anterior and posterior leaflet prolapse was similar in both groups, whereas <b>Barlow</b> <b>syndrome</b> was higher in group 2 (5. 8 % vs 27. 8 %). There was 1 (0. 33 %) hospital mortality and no deaths in the last 180 cases. Overall, 8 patients (2. 7 %) required subsequent mitral valve replacement via a median sternotomy, 6 (5. 0 %) in the first group and 2 (1. 1 %) in the second group (P = . 06). One patient in each group had mitral valve re-repair through a right mini-thoracotomy, and 1 patient in the first group required a mitral valve replacement via a mini-thoracotomy during the original procedure. Two of the 180 patients had documented cerebrovascular accident, but both fully recovered clinically. There was no cerebrovascular accident in the last 120 patients. Crossclamp times decreased from 116 minutes to 91 minutes in the second group despite starting a training program with a junior associate performing part of the procedure at the console in the last 100 cases. Post-pump echocardiograms showed no/trace mitral regurgitation in 86. 1 % of the last 180 patients and mild mitral regurgitation in 11. 1 %. Follow-up echocardiography for the last 180 patients from 1 month to more than 1 year showed no/trace mitral regurgitation in 64. 6 % of patients and mild mitral regurgitation in 23. 1 % of patients. Seven patients (10. 8 %) had moderate mitral regurgitation, and 1 patient (1. 5 %) had severe mitral regurgitation. ConclusionsThe majority of complications and reoperations occurred early in our experience, especially using the first-generation da Vinci robot (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif). The newer da Vinci Si HD system with the addition of an adjustable left atrial roof retractor together with increased experience has made robotic-assisted mitral repair of all types of degenerative mitral valve pathology reproducible. The training of young surgeons in a stepwise fashion in high-volume centers will help to avoid the complications encountered during the introduction of this technology...|$|E

40|$|Mitral valve billow and prolapse: a brief review at 45 years IWP OBEL summary <b>Barlow’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{has become}} a regular, often-used and very often misused diagnosis. Its {{description}} followed exten-sive, prolonged and detailed clinical observation by JB Barlow and his co-workers. This major research effort was necessary because of the protean manifestations of the condi-tion. The differentiation of <b>Barlow’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> from other conditions with similar and sometimes identical symptoms requires clear and unambiguous criteria.

40|$|SUMMARY Echocardiography {{was used}} to {{evaluate}} mitral and tricuspid valve closure in patients 1 day to 20 years of age. When possible, simultaneous phonocardiograms were obtained. The difference in time between the Q wave of the electrocardiogram and mitral closure and between Q and tricuspid closure was designated the delta value (A). Four groups of patients were assessed: 1) normals (40), secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) (10), mitral valve prolapse <b>syndrome</b> (<b>Barlow's</b> <b>syndrome)</b> (13), pulmonary hypertension (12), and pulmonic stenosis (6); 2) Ebstein's anomaly (10); 3) transposi-tion of the great vessels (15); 4) right bundle branch block (RBBB) (25). Ten patients with surgically induced right bundle branch block IN THE NORMAL HEART mitral valve closure precedes that of the tricuspid valve. These valves may be subjected to unusual hemodynamics in certain forms of congenital heart disease (such as transposition of the great arteries) or ma...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} relating to endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is presented. This is considered important at this time since EMB is being utilized with increasing frequency, particularly for the diagnosis of myocarditis. The development of the technique is briefly outlined. Emphasis is placed on the clinical application of EMB in the various primary cardiomyopathies (dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive, and obliterative), the infiltrative secondary cardiomyopathies (amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis), myocarditis, as well as such conditions as adriamycin cardiotoxicity, cardiac transplant rejection, and Kawasaki disease. More controversial application of EMB in primary mitral valve prolapse (<b>Barlow's</b> <b>syndrome),</b> idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias, and the elucidation of the enigmatic finding of angina with angiographically normal coronary arteries is detailed. Experience with immunological and biochemical investigation of biopsy material, as well as with virus isolation and drug assays in the myocardium, is alluded to. Complications encountered with the procedure are also discussed, and its future role is contemplated. Articl...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] 42 -year-old symptomatic woman with possible adult Williams's syndrome (mental retardation, 'elfin facies' and supravalvular aortic steosis (SVAS)) is documented. This patient displayed many unique features {{in addition to the}} severe SVAS (peak systolic gradient 96 mmHg) : there was an associated persistent left superior vena cava draining into the coronary sinus, mitral valve prolapse (<b>Barlow's</b> <b>syndrome)</b> and complete right bundle-branch block on ECG. Peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis was absent. M-mode echocardiography in the adult with SVAS is described {{for the first time in}} the literature, as is the use of the 60 ° cross-sectional scan. Both these non-invasive procedures proved of value in the diagnosis. The degree of subendocardial ischaemia, as determined by the 'endocardial viability ratio', was calculated and the possible mechanisms producing angina pectoris with 'coronary artery hypertension' in this condition are discussed. The literature on associated mitral valve abnormalities in SVAS is reviewed. A successful surgical result was obtained; the various forms of operation are outlined. Publishers' versio...|$|R
40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] 46 -year-old White man had a 2 -year history of frequent atypical chest pain associated with palpitations and presyncope. Clinical examination revealed an intermittent mid-systolic non-ejection click followed by a blowing mid-to-late systolic murmur indicative of the billowing mitral leaflet syndrome (BMLS) (primary mitral valve prolapse (MVP); <b>Barlow's</b> <b>syndrome).</b> This diagnossis was confirmed on cardiac catheterization, left ventricular cine angiography showing mild mitral insufficiency. M-mode and cross-sectional echocardiograms failed to show the MVP, although phonocardiography documented the intermittent non-ejection click and mid-systolic apical murmur. Ambulatory Holter monitoring showed symptomatic inferolateral myocardial ischaemia, and maximal stress-testing elicited asymptomatic ischaemia in the same zone. Selective coronary angiography delinated a normal left coronary artery and an insignificant fixed obstructive lesion {{in the second part}} of the dominent right coronary artery (RCA). Provocation with ergometrine (ergonovine) maleate gave rise to severe coronary vasospasm superimposed on the insignificant lesion in the RCA. This spasm provoked myocardial ischaemia resulting in symptomatic ventricular fibrillation which was successfully reserved. The patient's symptoms have been fairly well controlled by nitrates and nifedipine. As far as I am aware this is the first documentation of coronary vasospasm in the BMLS. In this syndrome coronary artery spasm has often been postulated to be responsible for acute myocardial infarction with a normal appearance of the coronary arteries on angiography. This mechanism has also been incriminated in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias in cases of primary MVP. These various contentious and important issues are reviewed. Publisher’s versio...|$|R
