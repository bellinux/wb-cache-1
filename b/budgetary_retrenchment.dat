50|$|The {{final three}} years of Tietz's {{presidency}} were marked by <b>budgetary</b> <b>retrenchment.</b> Tietz {{said he and his}} administrators spent 18 hours a day for two weeks to try to meet the cuts required by the legislature (which totalled more than 10 percent). Among the programs cut were membership in the Center for Research Libraries; sports like skiing, women's gymnastics, and wrestling; undergraduate degree programs like business education, engineering science, and industrial arts; and the Office of Institutional Research. The five departments of the College of Education were merged into two. The departments of home economics and physical education were merged, as were the departments of agricultural engineering and civil engineering. Two programs slated for closure were international studies and the School of Architecture. But after bitter battles with the public, students, faculty, professional associations, and the legislature, Tietz was forced to keep them both open. Architecture was saved only because students in the program agreed to tax themselves an extra $190 a semester to pay for faculty salaries.|$|E

40|$|Boom {{and bust}} phases in asset prices {{have become a}} {{pervasive}} feature of macroeconomic developments in many advanced economies. This paper studies fiscal policy during boom-bust phases in asset prices and draws several conclusions. First, expansions and contractions in economic activity during such boom-bust phases tend to be highly persistent, cyclical turning points are harder to forecast, and the margins of error for output gap estimates can be large. Second, conventional estimates of revenue elasticities seem not to allow an accurate assessment of the fiscal stance and {{of the strength of}} underlying fiscal positions during boom-bust phases. And third, boom-bust phases tend to exacerbate already existing procyclical policy biases, as well as political-economy biases, toward higher spending and public debt ratios.

40|$|The {{sovereign}} debt {{crisis in the}} euro area prompted many EU countries to step up efforts at fiscal consolidation in order to stem the rise in interest rates on their government bonds. This will dampen internal demand {{in the years to}} come, in particular if <b>budgetary</b> <b>retrenchment</b> should lose sight of policies for long-term economic growth and labour market conditions. At the same time, business activity outside the euro area is losing momentum. As a consequence, GDP growth in Austria is projected to slow down to a modest 0. 4 percent in 2012. In 2013, Austria will benefit from the expected global recovery, although growth will remain subdued at 1. 6 percent in volume, given the continued restrictive stance of fiscal policy across Europe.

The experience of the Maastricht-induced fiscal consolidation shows that the political economy dimension of the rules is key for their success. It remains to be seen whether the Stability and Growth Pact, which complements the Treaty, aims at locking EMU members into a fiscal discipline commitment while allowing for flexibility to cushion cyclical fluctuations. In order to succeed in this undertaking, EU governments and institutions have to bank on the political economy “drive ” which made Maastricht a success while tackling a number of open issues in the implementation of the Pact...|$|E

The Stability and Growth Pact locks EMU members into a fiscal discipline commitment while allowing for flexibility to cushion cyclical fluctuations.

40|$|Driven by {{the desire}} to fulfil the Maastricht fiscal {{criteria}} and pressed by mounting debt burdens that have accumulated over the past 30 years, a majority of EU- 15 countries attempted to reduce their budget deficits during the 1990 s. Yet, these nations have exhibited remarkable differences in their ability to pursue such retrenchment policies. This paper endeavours to illuminate the the empirical relevance of political and institutional factors that can help explain those differing degrees of fiscal retrenchment in European Union countries for the time period 1990 - 2001. Several variants of the partisan approach and the veto players framework are applied to the question of budgetary consolidation.

40|$|Defense {{industrial}} complexes {{in leading}} Cold War nations have downsized and reallocated resources to other productive {{activities in the}} 1990 s. In this paper, we analyze the experience of two key countries - the US and France. Comparing the two countries, we find similar outcomes in <b>budgetary</b> <b>retrenchment</b> and large firm restructuring but marked differences in the pace of downsizing and diversification among small and medium-sized firms. We hypothesize that three sets of contextual differences may explain these differences: 1) institutional differences {{in the way that}} the State bureaucracies - the Pentagon and the French Delegation generale pour l'armement (DGA) - oversee defense industrial matters, 2) differences in military industry ownership and firm size patterns, and 3) differences in the regional distribution of defense industrial capacity and associated regional policies. In closing, we note that the two countries' defense industrial complexes are becoming more alike and speculate on the significance of invidious competition and interactions between them. We address briefly the future of French/American arms industrial competition and cooperation, given the trend towards transnational security arrangements and defense industry globalizationdefense industry, civil/military integration, defense conversion, military procurement,...|$|E

40|$|Like all output-producing organisations, social {{services}} departments must {{be concerned with}} efficiency, this concern being redoubled in the new era of <b>budgetary</b> <b>retrenchment.</b> In these circumstances, the fostering of innovations which will contribute to greater efficiency becomes crucial. In an attempt to analyse this process, we first of all list various 'signs' which indicate the presence of greater efficiency and then produce 'scores' for authorities on this basis which we predict through various modelling procedures. We conclude that the most successful approach {{to the study of}} the improvement of efficiency through innovation sees such behaviour as largely motivated by the search for external finance. In these circumstances the construction of appropriate organisational incentives, such as Joint Finance, takes on a new significance. We then analyse the process of implementation of such innovatory schemes and locate two cut-off points; the initial floating of the idea and the transition to mainstream practice. The latter blockage can be best explained through internal bargaining procedures among established producer groups. Our conclusions are threefold. First, reviews of service provision clearly increase the propensity to innovate. In this case, it would appear to be most unwise to ask for disproportionate cuts in research, planning and development staff who usually playa major part in such reviews. Second, external financial incentives do playa major role in improving efficiency through innovation. Recent decisions to increase the level of Joint Financing must therefore be welcomed. Finally, internal barriers to innovation can be best overcome by top level support for innovation combined with the use of development officers to bridge the gap between very different producer groups...|$|E
