5|$|The {{expected}} {{number of}} generations for fixation to occur {{is proportional to}} the population size, such that fixation is predicted to occur much more rapidly in smaller populations. Normally the effective population size, which is smaller than the total population, is used to determine these probabilities. The effective population (N'e) takes into account factors such as the level of inbreeding, the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest, and the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection. The effective population size may not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> every gene in the same population.|$|E
5|$|The {{time for}} a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on {{population}} size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations. The number of individuals in a population is not critical, but instead a measure known as the effective population size. The effective population is usually smaller than the total population since it takes into account {{factors such as the}} level of inbreeding and the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest. The effective population size may not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> every gene in the same population.|$|E

5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of direct election, the new Constitution was seen as such a radical break with the old system, by which delegates were elected to the Confederation Congress by state legislatures, that the Convention agreed to retain this method of electing senators to make the constitutional change less radical. The more difficult problem was the issue of apportionment. The Connecticut delegation offered a compromise, whereby the number of representatives for each state in the lower house would be apportioned based on the relative size of the state's population, {{while the number of}} representatives in the upper house would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> all of the states, irrespective of size. The large states, fearing a diminution of their influence in the legislature under this plan, opposed this proposal. Unable to reach agreement, the delegates decided to leave this issue for further consideration later during the meeting.|$|E

25|$|In {{a classic}} set of experiments, the Englishman Osborne Reynolds (1842–1912) of the University of Manchester {{demonstrated}} that the airflow pattern over a scale model would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> the full-scale vehicle if a certain flow parameter were the same in both cases. This factor, {{now known as the}} Reynolds number, is a basic parameter in the description of all fluid-flow situations, including the shapes of flow patterns, the ease of heat transfer, and the onset of turbulence. This comprises the central scientific justification for the use of models in wind tunnels to simulate real-life phenomena. However, there are limitations on conditions in which dynamic similarity is based upon the Reynolds number alone.|$|E
25|$|Often {{more than}} one ELS related to some topic can be {{displayed}} simultaneously in an ELS letter array.

Normally only a smaller rectangle would be displayed, such as the rectangle drawn in the figure. In that case there would be letters missing between adjacent lines in the picture, but it is essential that the number of missing letters <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> each line.|$|E

25|$|In February 1880, Secretary of State William M. Evarts asked Angell {{to go to}} China {{as part of a}} two-member {{commission}} (to which Angell {{proposed the}} addition of a third member) with the goal of negotiating changes to the Burlingame Treaty that would reduce what was viewed as a flood of Chinese immigrants into the Pacific United States. Angell was nominated by President Hayes, confirmed by the Senate as Minister to China and chairman of the treaty commission on April 9, 1880, and left for Peking that June with fellow commissioners John F. Swift and William Henry Trescot. Henry S. Frieze was appointed acting president of the University of Michigan in his absence. The commission negotiated two treaties. The first, formally called the Treaty Regulating Immigration from China and dubbed by historians as the Angell Treaty of 1880, allowed the U.S. to regulate and limit the immigration of Chinese laborers, but not to prohibit it outright. The second was a trade treaty that outlawed the trade of opium and set tonnage dues and tariffs to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> both nations. The treaties, collectively, were signed on November 17, 1880, and the other commissioners returned home, leaving Angell in China to fulfill his duties as Minister. After a year, he decided to return to academia and left China on October 4, 1881, taking a trip through Europe and returning to Ann Arbor on February 24, 1882. Most of the protections for Chinese immigrants that the treaty had secured were reversed by Congress in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.|$|E

This fable is the first adaptation of the original into a vernacular language of India. Containing sixty fables in all, thirteen of which are original, each is summarised by an ethical moral based on a Jain tenet. Durgasimha also authored the Karnataka Banachatantra, the earliest available commentary in the Kannada language, giving a brief commentary on all the Sanskrit verses he quoted in the Panchatantra.
