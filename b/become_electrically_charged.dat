5000|$|... pH {{partition}} is {{the tendency}} for acids to accumulate in basic fluid compartments, and bases to accumulate in acidic compartments. The reason for this phenomenon is that acids become negatively electric charged in basic fluids, since they donate a proton. On the other hand, bases become positively electric charged in acid fluids, since they receive a proton. Since electric charge decrease the membrane permeability of substances, once an acid enters a basic fluid and <b>becomes</b> <b>electrically</b> <b>charged,</b> then it cannot escape that compartment with ease and therefore accumulates, and vice versa with bases.|$|R
50|$|A fine mist of oil {{droplets}} was sprayed into {{a chamber}} above the plates. The oil {{was of a}} type usually used in vacuum apparatus and was chosen because it had an extremely low vapour pressure. Ordinary oil would evaporate under {{the heat of the}} light source causing the mass of the oil drop to change {{over the course of the}} experiment. Some oil drops <b>became</b> <b>electrically</b> <b>charged</b> through friction with the nozzle as they were sprayed. Alternatively, charging could be brought about by including an ionising radiation source (such as an X-ray tube). The droplets entered the space between the plates and, because they were charged, could be made to rise and fall by changing the voltage across the plates.|$|R

An edge dislocation in a semiconductor material <b>becomes</b> <b>electrically</b> <b>charged</b> when free electrons migrate to the dangling bonds along the core the line charge along the core is then partially screened by the background free carrier concentration. In this work we consider the atomistic structure of an edge dislocation in a technologically important compound semiconductor material, GaN, and develop a complete continuum model of the electrostatic structure of the dislocation. The atomistic analysis is used to determine the maximum charged state of the dislocation core according to first principles electronic structure analysis the maximum charged state is then expressed as a continuum electrostatic potential. By formulating an energy balance model {{as a function of the}} incremental filling of electron acceptor sites, the equilibrium electrostatic state of the dislocation is then determined. This electrostatic state can then be used as the basis for predictive models of electrical scattering or optical absorption.

40|$|It {{is known}} that after Affleck-Dine baryogenesis, spatial inhomogeneities of Affleck-Dine field grow into non-topological solitons called Q-balls. In gauge {{mediated}} SUSY breaking models, sufficiently large Q-balls with baryon charge are stable while Q-balls with lepton charge can always decay into leptons. For a Q-ball that carries nonzero $B$ and $L$ charges, {{the difference between the}} baryonic component and the leptonic component in decay rate may induce nonzero electric charge on the Q-ball. This implies that charged Q-ball, also called gauged Q-ball, may emerge in our universe. In this paper, we investigate two complex scalar fields, a baryonic scalar field and a leptonic one, in an Abelian gauge theory. We find stable solutions of gauged Q-balls for different baryon and lepton charges. Those solutions shows that a Coulomb potential arises and the Q-ball <b>becomes</b> <b>electrically</b> <b>charged</b> as expected. It is energetically favored that some amount of leptonic component decays, but there is an upper bound on its amount due to the Coulomb force. The baryonic decay also becomes possible by virtue of electrical repulsion and we find the condition to suppress it so that the charged Q-balls can survive in the universe.

40|$|A general {{covariant}} quantization of superparticle, Green-Schwarz superstring and a supermembrane with manifest supersymmetry and duality symmetry is proposed. This quantization {{provides a}} natural quantum mechanical description of curved BPStype backgrounds {{related to the}} ultra-short supersymmetry multiplets. Half-size commuting and anticommuting Killing spinors admitted by such backgrounds in quantum theory become truncated κ-symmetry ghosts. The symmetry of Killing spinors under dualities transfers to the symmetry of the spectrum of states. GS superstring in the generalized semi-light-cone gauge can be quantized consistently {{in the background of}} ten-dimensional supersymmetric gravitational waves. Upon compactification they <b>become</b> supersymmetric <b>electrically</b> <b>charged</b> black holes, either massive or massless. However, the generalized light-cone gauge breaks S-duality. We propose a new family of gauges, which we call black hole gauges. These gauges are suitable for quantization both in flat Minkowski space and in the black hole background, and they are duality symmetric. As an example, a manifestly S-duality symmetric black hole gauge is constructed in terms of the axion-dilaton-electric-magnetic black hole hair. We also suggest the U-duality covariant class of gauges for type II superstrings. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{thermosphere}} is {{the layer}} of the Earth's atmosphere directly above the mesosphere. The exosphere is above that but is a minor layer of the atmosphere. Within this layer of the atmosphere, ultraviolet radiation causes photoionization/photodissociation of molecules, creating ions in the ionosphere. Taking {{its name from the}} Greek θερμός (pronounced thermos) meaning heat, the thermosphere begins about 85 km above the Earth. At these high altitudes, the residual atmospheric gases sort into strata according to molecular mass (see turbosphere). Thermospheric temperatures increase with altitude due to absorption of highly energetic solar radiation. Temperatures are highly dependent on solar activity, and can rise to 2000 C. Radiation causes the atmosphere particles in this layer to <b>become</b> <b>electrically</b> <b>charged</b> (see ionosphere), enabling radio waves to be refracted and thus be received beyond the horizon. In the exosphere, beginning at 500 to 1000 km above the Earth's surface, the atmosphere turns into space, although by the criteria set for the definition of the Kármán line, the thermosphere itself is part of space.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} {{and intensity of}} total (i. e., combined stratified and convective processes) rainrate/latent heat release (LHR) were derived for tropical cyclone Paka during the period 9 - 21 December, 1997 from the F- 10, F- 11, F- 13, and F- 14 Defense Meteorological Satellite Special Sensor Microwave/Imager and the Tropical Rain Measurement Mission Microwave Imager observations. These observations were frequent enough to capture three episodes of inner core convective bursts that preceded periods of rapid intensification and a convective rainband (CRB) cycle. During these periods of convective bursts, satellite sensors revealed that the rainrates/LHR: 1) increased within the inner eye wall region; 2) were mainly convectively generated (nearly a 65 % contribution), 3) propagated inwards; 4) extended upwards within the middle and upper-troposphere, and 5) <b>became</b> <b>electrically</b> <b>charged.</b> These factors may have caused the eye wall region to become more buoyant within the middle and upper-troposphere, creating greater cyclonic angular momentum, and, thereby, warming the center and intensifying the system. Radiosonde measurements from Kwajalein Atoll and Guam, sea surface temperature observations, and the European Center for Medium Range Forecast analyses were {{used to examine the}} necessary and sufficient condition for initiating and maintaining these inner core convective bursts. For example, the necessary conditions such as the atmospheric thermodynamics (i. e., cold tropopause temperatures, moist troposphere, and warm SSTs [greater than 26 deg]) suggested that the atmosphere was ideal for Paka's maximum potential intensity (MPI) to approach super-typhoon strength. Further, Paka encountered weak vertical wind shear (less than 15 m/s) before interacting with the westerlies on 21 December. The sufficient conditions, on the other hand, appeared to have some influence on Paka's convective burst, but the horizontal moisture flux convergence values in the outer core were weaker than some of the previously examined tropical cyclones. Also, the upper tropospheric outflow generation of eddy relative angular momentum flux convergence was 4 D much less than that found during moderate tropical cyclone/trough interaction. These results indicated how important the external necessary condition and the internal forcing (i. e., CRB cycle) were in generating Paka's convective bursts as compared to the external sufficient forcing mechanisms found in higher latitude tropical cyclones. Later, as Paka began to interact with the westerlies, both the necessary (i. e., strong vertical shear and colder SSTs) and sufficient (i. e., dry air intrusion) external forcing mechanisms helped to decrease Paka's rainrate...|$|R

The topological excitation of the SU(2) × U(1) theory (the monopole) {{plays the role}} of the Higgs field, it carries the SU(2) ×U(1) topological charge due to the theta–term of the special type. In this paper we suggest a new formulation of Wainberg- Salam model on the lattice. The nice feature of our approach is that we have no fundamental Higgs field in the initial Lagrangian (there been a number of attempts to eliminate the fundamental Higgs field from electroweak Lagrangian [1, 2]). The Higgs field appears as topological monopole excitation; due to θ–term with θ = π the U(1) monopole acquires the SU(2) × U(1) charge and <b>become</b> the scalar <b>electrically</b> <b>charged</b> field (see also [3, 4]).

40|$|The {{development}} of an experimental system used to investigate charged droplets is presented. The experimental setup combines optical levitation with Millikan's classical oil drop experiment and has also {{been used as a}} mean to demonstrate fundamental physical phenomena. Oil or water droplets are trapped in a vertical laser beam where their sizes can be determined. A vertical electric field is used to move the droplet in the laser beam and a feedback loop for the laser power repositions the droplet. Oil droplets can be levitated for up to eight hours and their absolute charge and mass can be measured. Water droplets are held a few minutes and their sizes and evaporation rates were studied. Even the polarity of their charge can be determined. Decreasing amplitude of the oscillations is seen when oil droplets oscillated by an electric field are exposed to α-particles. With continued exposure to α-particles a change in the phase of the oscillations, due to change in the polarity of the charge, can be achieved. Droplets generated, through pipetting or spraying, <b>become</b> <b>electrically</b> <b>charged.</b> The experimental setup is a valuable tool for investigating charged droplets and the magnitude of the charge can be determined without losing the droplet.

40|$|The {{spectacular}} lightning displays {{that can}} sometimes be seen during volcanic eruptions demonstrate that the emitted plumes readily <b>become</b> <b>electrically</b> <b>charged,</b> but the relationships between volcanic parameters, meteorological conditions, and lightning type and rate are not well understood. The variability and range of physical processes involved, and difficulties of in situ measurements – here defined as those made in and near the plume – are the major reasons for this uncertainty. Lightning in volcanic plumes has now been measured in some detail using established remote sensing systems that can characterise both lightning location and flash rate. It {{seems likely that the}} meteorological mechanisms generating lightning in thunderstorms are enhanced by the presence of ash, a mechanism that we refer to as the ash-rich icy electrification system (ARIES). The ash brings its own fractoemission and triboelectric (frictional) charging mechanisms, which are thought to dominate close to the vent where large numbers of weaker lightning strikes are seen. Charging in distal plumes has been detected by enhanced meteorological radiosondes, indicating that self-charging continues during dispersion. Laboratory measurement of ash samples under controlled conditions suggest that the self-charging efficiency of atmospheric plumes is related to the size distribution of the particles, and therefore that self-charging can occur in all plumes. Measurements of laboratory electrical charging alone are inadequate to fully characterise plume electrostatics, which has motivated integrated radiosonde packages for in situ plume measurements, such as particle size and location, turbulence and thermodynamic structure...|$|E
