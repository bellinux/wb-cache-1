After clinical examination, patients were classified as 'acutely or severely ill' or as 'not ill'. Plasma gonadotropins were compared between both groups. Logistic regression was used to select clinical and/or biochemical parameters which differentiated patients with abnormal, low gonadotropins from patients with high gonadotropin concentrations. Plasma gonadotropins were significantly lower in the 'acutely or severely ill' than in the 'healthy' patient group. By logistic regression, <b>blood</b> <b>sedimentation</b> rate, total protein concentration, and serum thyrotropin concentration were significantly correlated with low gonadotropins. Linear regression analysis showed a significant linear relationship between plasma gonadotropins and age (at least for ages over 80 years), <b>blood</b> <b>sedimentation</b> rate (at values more than 65 mm) and total protein concentration.

Bendien (2) himself claims that his test is a superior prognostic <b>test</b> to the <b>sedimentation</b> rate, but does not offer convincing data in support of this claim. It appeared to us desirable to investigate this claim, for even if the Bendien test were proved to be as reliable as—but no more reliable than— the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>test,</b> the former still possessed certain advantages of con-venience over the latter. It is a serum test, and the serum can be used a few days after it is obtained from the patient without affecting the result. Moreover, the serum can be transmitted (by post or messenger) to a labora-tory. The <b>sedimentation</b> <b>test,.</b> on the other hand, ties one to the patient and to the clock in a manner that must definitely limit its application.

At {{the very beginning of}} the fattening period bulls belonged to medium condition category and by the end of fattening period they were in very good condition category. Bulls were five months old when the research commenced and they were eleven months old when the reserch was terminated. All body dimensions were measured by Litin stick except for breast circuit, metacarpus circuit and body weight. Bulls were tied and remained at the same place during their fattening period staying in ordinary cow-shed made of brick. All height measures increased at the relatively equal pace during the fattening period. Withers height increased most and back height increased the least. Tenderness of the back appeared to be most prominent at the end of fattening period. Concerning length dimensions, body length developed quickest, head length slowest. As far as body width of bulls is considered the fastest growth was recorded concerning pelvis breadth; head front breadth increased the least. Breast depth was most notable at the point of bulls entering the category of very good condition during their fattening process. Brest circuit increase, as well as metacarups circuit and body weighat increase, were considerably quicker during the period of bulls going from medium condition category to good condition category then from the middle to the end of fattening period.

At the same time the relationship between <b>blood</b> <b>sedimentation</b> rate and the liver function was studied and the following conclusions were drawn: 1) Prior to pulmonary resections the majority of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis show the values of both serum polysaccharide and of the rate of non-glucosamine polysaccharide to serum total protein (N. G. P. /S. T.) within the normal range, but in some of the group, such as ones with lobectomy, thoracoplasty and pneumonectomy, reveal a slight to a moderate increase in these values. 2) In pulmonary tuberculosis the values of serum polysaccharide and N. G. P. /S. T. P. after the operation show a marked transient increase as compared with those before resections. Howevr, decreasing slowly, these values, even in the cases which showed high values prior to the resections, later fall down to the normal level. It required 40 to 50 days to recover to the normal level in the cases with segmental resections, lobectomy, and thoracoplasty, while showing no significant difference among them. In the cases with pneumonectomy the duration of recovery time is markedly prolonged, namely, it requires 90 days after operation. 3) In the cases with complication of empyema the values of serum polysaccharide and N.

In this study, we aimed to investigate prospectively {{the potential impact of}} atelectasis and/or obstructive pneumonitis (AO) on survival and the relation between atelectasis and some laboratory blood parameters. The study was conducted on 87 advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Clinical and laboratory parameters of patients at first presentation were recorded, and patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of AO in thorax computed tomography (CT). Survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier and univariate Cox's regression analyses. Laboratory parameters that might be related with prolonged survival in atelectasis were compared using chi-square, Student's t, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Of the patients, 54 % had stage IV disease, and AO was detected in 48. 3 % of all cases. Overall median survival was 13. 2 months for all cases, 10. 9 months for patients without AO, and 13. 9 months for patients with AO (P = 0. 067). Survival was significantly longer in stage III patients with AO (14. 5 months versus 9. 2 months, P = 0. 032), but not in stage IV patients.

The electrophoresis and adsorption tests show that polyether can selectively adsorb onto pentlandite surface through hydrophobic reaction and remove serpentine slime particles from pentlandite surfaces by steric hindrance effect...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Some {{alterations}} of the lipoprotein profile {{have been}} associated with cerebrovascular disease. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} cerebrovascular disease might play a role in the pathogenesis of both vascular dementia (VD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the possible association of dyslipidemias with VD or AD is still a controversial issue. METHODS: We investigated the lipoprotein profile in 100 older patients with vascular dementia (VD; no degrees: 60) or Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD; no degrees: 40). The patients were compared with 54 community dwelling non-demented older controls. RESULTS: After adjustment for functional status, <b>blood</b> <b>sedimentation</b> rate, and serum albumin levels, no differences in lipoprotein profile emerged between the three groups, with the exception of HDL-C that was lower in VD compared with controls. Low HDL-C (< 45 mg/dL) was associated with VD (O. R. : 6. 52, C. I. 95...|$|R
40|$|Industrial waste {{containing}} colloidal {{particulate matter}} such as coal and mineral processing tailings presents many {{environmental and economic}} challenges. Effective management solutions for these challenges require an improved understanding of colloidal forces between tailings particles which control their flocculation and subsequent dewatering. In this paper, the colloidal and dewatering behaviours of four coal processing tailings were investigated {{in the presence of}} four high molecular weight anionic polyelectrolytes using the AFM (atomic force microscope) colloid probe technique, flocculation and <b>sedimentation</b> <b>testing,</b> and colloid and surface characterisation. Averaged snap-off distances statistically determined from thousands of force curves measured by AFM were obtained by dividing the area between the force curve and the horizontal axis by the maximum adhesion force. This novel assessment of the AFM results showed that for each of the tailing samples and flocculants tested there was statistically a maximum snap-off distance, which on average would correspond to the optimum flocculant concentration. Under this optimum concentration condition the adhesive strength is the strongest to resist potential floc breakage caused by external hydrodynamic forces. Flocculation and <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tests</b> also showed optimum flocculant concentrations for the different tailings samples but these concentrations were much higher than those corresponding to the optimum adhesive strength found with the AFM measurements. This was due to the large surface area of particles in the concentrated suspension used in the settling tests compared with just a few particles used in the atomic force measurement and therefore the two optimum concentrations per unit surface area of particles would be similar...|$|R
