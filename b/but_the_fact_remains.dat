40|$|Entrepreneurship {{is largely}} ignored or {{treated in a}} highly {{simplified}} way in endogenous growth theory. Still, it is now widely recognized that the supply of entrepreneurial talent {{is likely to be}} important for economic growth, innovation and job creation. In this study we provide an in-depth examination of how the supply of productive entrepreneurship is likely to be affected by the kind of tax and welfare arrangements that may prevail in a mature welfare state. Sweden, allegedly the most extensive of all welfare states, is the object of the empirical analysis. It is argued that the Swedish welfare state early on chose a specific “Swedish Model” of trying to combine ambitious welfare programs and a high tax burden with good opportunities for economic growth. This particular view rested heavily on the assumption that innovative activity was best performed in large established firms and that entry of new firms was less important. Consequently, policy and institutions were geared to promoting certain types of activities which could deliver growth if scale economies are important and intrapreneurship can substitute for entrepreneurship. However, in an environment where entry, exit and turnover of firms are important for growth, and where scale-economies are less important, this kind of model may be more problematic. Both aggregate economic performance and data on firm growth and direct measures of entrepreneurial activity are broadly consistent with the identified structure of payoffs. A number of measures that can be implemented to strengthen entrepreneurial incentives within extensive welfare states are discussed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> still <b>remains</b> that an entrepreneurial culture and a welfare state are very remotely related.

40|$|In active {{noise control}} systems sound waves with phase {{opposite}} to the unwanted noise are used to interfere destructively with the noise, generating quite zones, where the noise level is lower. Since most systems use point sensors like microphones to sense the noise field the quiet zone generated by system can be small. Outside the quite zones amplification of the noise may happen. In narrow band {{active noise control}} systems the dimension of the quite zone around each error sensor will be proportional to the wavelength of the noise being cancelled. In broadband active noise control systems several error sensors per anti-noise source are used (two {{as a rule of}} thumb) in order to achieve wider cancellations regions, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> still <b>remains</b> that <b>the</b> size of the quiet zone will be proportional to the wavelength of the noise. Actually using two microphones per anti-noise source makes the controller adapt in to a band limiting filter in order to prevent the generation of anti-noise with frequencies that are amplified inside the quite zone. In this paper, techniques to band limit the anti-noise are studied that do not need the extra number of error sensors. This extends previous work for the single channel case to the multi-channel case with several reference, error sensors and anti-noise sources. This can’t be done by simpling placing a filter in the cancellation path, or using the anti-aliasing or reconstruction filters, unless you use a very sharp filter with long delay and a leakage factor. Instead several structures based on the MFx-LMS algorithm are presented that accomplish this task. The proposed structures also give some insight into the limitations of broadband active noise control systems due to the delay required to the band limiting actio...|$|R
