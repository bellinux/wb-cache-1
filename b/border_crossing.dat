5|$|The Blue Water Bridge links Sarnia and its {{neighbouring}} {{village of}} Point Edward {{to the city}} of Port Huron in the United States. It spans the St. Clair River, which connects Lake Huron to Lake St. Clair. The bridge's original three-lane span, opened in 1938, was twinned on 22 July 1997, making the bridge the fourth busiest <b>border</b> <b>crossing</b> in Ontario. The Blue Water Bridge <b>border</b> <b>crossing</b> makes use of both the NEXUS (frequent traveler program) and the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program.

5|$|SR 11 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1994. Four years later, several parties, {{including}} District 11 of Caltrans, the City and County of San Diego, the San Diego Association of Governments, and Tijuana were signatories to a Letter of Intent to build the <b>border</b> <b>crossing.</b> The route {{was added to}} the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1999. In 2009, Senate Bill 1486 was passed, and the presidential permit in 2008 allowed for the <b>border</b> <b>crossing</b> to be constructed. By one year later, several alternatives were considered, in terms of constructing some or even none of the interchanges, or removing the proposed toll on the route. State funding is allocated to cover much of the $400 million cost, which does not include the port of entry at another $350 million. The California Transportation Commission endorsed the project in January 2012, and approved the proposed freeway route that December.|$|E
5|$|SR11 is {{proposed}} to be a toll facility {{that will serve}} a new <b>border</b> <b>crossing</b> east of Otay Mesa, the Otay Mesa East Port of Entry. It will connect SR 905 and SR 125 to the Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 corridor that connects to Mexican Federal Highway 2D and Mexican Federal Highway 2 to Tecate, and Mexican Federal Highway 1D to Ensenada.|$|E

5|$|A {{road from}} the town of Potrero to Tecate existed by 1917. The Tecate <b>border</b> <b>crossing</b> {{originally}} opened in 1932. In 1938, the San Diego County board of supervisors proposed moving rerouting the road to be shorter and on more level ground, although there was opposition from local residents and businesses who favored the old road. However, the route of the road to Tecate has remained the same since then.|$|E
5|$|In late 1977, the CPO {{made plans}} to push for adding SR117 to the Interstate Highway System, to obtain {{additional}} federal funding. By 1979, both San Diego city and county had allocated $6million to construct a temporary way to access the <b>border</b> <b>crossing</b> along Otay Mesa and Harvest Roads. Two years later, the City of San Diego indicated that the upgrade of Otay Mesa Road to a four-lane road would be the preferred option; the state agreed to allocate $2million towards the $10million project, with the city contributing $6.4million and the county adding $2.3million. The Federal Highway Administration approved the continuous roadway via SR117 and SR125 from I-5 to the border at Otay Mesa as a non-chargeable (not eligible for federal Interstate Highway construction dollars) part of the Interstate Highway System in October1984. The Otay Mesa <b>border</b> <b>crossing</b> opened on January 24, 1985. The route number was legislatively changed to 905 in 1986, and signs were updated in 1988. This change was to apply for other federal funding. The original piece of SR117, west of I-5, also became SR905 {{with the rest of}} SR117, but Caltrans has not constructed it.|$|E

5|$|Planning was {{underway}} for {{the extension of}} SR75 east to the then-proposed SR125 by 1963. The California Highway Commission endorsed the routing for SR75 in 1965 along Otay Mesa Road, away from future residential developments. There were plans as early as 1970 to have a highway heading southwest to a new <b>border</b> <b>crossing</b> that would bypass the Tijuana area. The next year, James Moe, the state public works director, subsequently asked the California State Legislature to lengthen SR75 to connect to this new crossing, rather than using I-5 to make the connection.|$|E

5|$|After the Berlin Wall {{was built}} in 1961, Zoologischer Garten became the West Berlin and Ostbahnhof the East Berlin de facto central station. The station Friedrichstraße now was the {{terminal}} point of the separated West and East Berlin S-Bahn lines and departure point for the Interzonenzug (Inter-zone train) services between West Berlin and West Germany. Friedrichstraße station was separated into Eastern and Western parts with steel walls, and enabled West Berliners to change to S-Bahn trains running on the Nord-Süd-Bahn and the U6 line of the Berlin U-Bahn without passing through GDR border controls. The station also featured a <b>border</b> <b>crossing</b> into East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} is also {{planned for}} the A5 motorway north of Osijek, across the Drava River, to the Hungarian border, where it will connect to the Hungarian M6 motorway at a Branjin Vrh/Ivándárda <b>border</b> <b>crossing.</b> This route will also contain two new exits near Čeminac and Beli Manastir and a new bridge over the Drava River.
