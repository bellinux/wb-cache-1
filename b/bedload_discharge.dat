5000|$|Direct and {{indirect}} methods {{are two ways}} in which bed material can be measured. Direct measurement is done {{through the use of}} a physical trap, placing the device in contact with the bed, “allowing the sediment transported as bedload to accumulate (or be trapped) inside the sampler for a certain amount of time, after which the sampler is raised to the surface and the material is emptied and weighed to determine a weight transported per unit time." [...] There are three types of direct samplers, which include a box or basket, pan or tray, and pressure difference as described by Hubbell (1964). Measurements of <b>bedload</b> <b>discharge</b> are rare and frequently of unknown accuracy because no bedload sampler has been extensively tested and calibrated over a wide range of hydraulic conditions. The box sampler has an opening that allows sediment to enter, the pan or tray samplers are placed in front of the open front of a box, and the pressure difference sampler is made to produce a pressure drop at the end of the nozzle. Accurate field measurements are very difficult to make, errors principally associated with the measuring devices themselves and with the extreme temporal variations in transport rate, which are a characteristic feature of bed material movement. Indirect measurements can be performed by a tracer, repeated channel surveys, bedform velocimetry, or velocimetry. No one method is entirely satisfactory, but indirect channel surveys, provided they are detailed enough at the reach scale, can produce reliable results, and have the advantages of minimum disturbance to the flow and time-integrated sampling which averages out short-term fluctuations in the transport rate.|$|E
40|$|Several {{methods were}} {{employed}} in the Ardennian rivers (Belgium) to determine {{the depth of the}} active layer mobilized during floods and to evaluate the <b>bedload</b> <b>discharge</b> associated with these events. The use of scour chains has shown that the depth of the active layer is systematically less than the b-axis of the average particle size (D 50) of the elements which compose the surface layer of the riffles. This indicates that only a partial transport exists during low magnitude floods. The <b>bedload</b> <b>discharge</b> has been evaluated by combining data obtained using the scour chains technique and the distance covered by tracers. Quantities of sediment transported during frequent floods are relatively low (0 02 t km– 2) due to the armour layer which protects the subsurface material. These low values are also related {{to the fact that the}} distance calculated for mobilized bedload only applies to tracers fitted with PIT (passive integrated transponder) -tags (diameter> 20 mm), whereas part of the <b>bedload</b> <b>discharge</b> is composed of sand and fine gravel transported over greater distances than the pebbles. The break-up of the armour layer was observed only once, for a decennial discharge. During this event, the <b>bedload</b> <b>discharge</b> increased considerably (2 t km– 2). The use of sediment traps, data from dredging and a Helley–Smith sampler confirm the low bedload transport in Ardennian rivers in comparison to the bedload transport in other geomorphological contexts. This difference is explained by the presence of an armoured layer but also by the imbricated structures of flat bed elements which increase the resistance to the flow. Finally, the use of the old iron industry wastes allowed to quantify the thickness of the bed reworked over the past centuries. In the Lembrée River, the river-bed contains slag elements up to a depth of about 50 cm, indicating that exceptional floods may rework the bed to a considerable depth. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Bedload {{transport}} {{has been}} studied in Ardenne rivers using different methods. Experiments with marked pebbles were carried out on gravel bed rivers {{in order to determine}} critical parameters of mobilisation. The tracking of more than 1000 elements marked with PIT-tags (Passive Integrated Transponder) has been performed on different sized rivers during three hydrological seasons. These surveys allowed us to determine the initial motion of bed material, to measure the distance of particle travel from flood to flood, to reconstruct the trajectories of pebbles, to analyze the burying of particles into the subsurface layer and to identify the trapping sites and their effects on the bedload progression. On the same rivers, the thickness of the active bed layer has been measured using scour chains. It appears that the mobilised layer thickness increases with specific stream power. <b>Bedload</b> <b>discharge</b> of several floods has also been estimated crossing the active layer thickness and the mean progression distance of marked pebbles. Pits have been dug across the bed of a gravel bed stream (catchment area of 12 km²) in order to trap all particles moving on the bed. Volume of sediments trapped has been measured after each flood event and the largest elements mobilised have been measured. These observations show that bedload trapped is clearly more important that <b>bedload</b> <b>discharge</b> estimated by the method of scour chains and marked pebbles. This difference is for the most part explained by the trapping of sandy matrix from the subsurface layer, which is also moving on the bed. In this headwater stream (forested floodplain), the specific <b>bedload</b> <b>discharge</b> is only 0. 4 t. km- 1. year- 1. Such a value is relatively low in comparison with other Ardenne rivers (up to 2, 5 t. km- 1. year- 1), but may be partly explained by numerous vegetation logjams, which slow down bedload progression and increase bed roughness.

The recorded floods are grouped in two distinct categories according to the bedload transport rates: ‘ordinary’ and ‘exceptional’ floods (with return times exceeding 30 – 50 years).

Prediction of the sediment transport rate and divisionthereof at bifurcations is of utmost importance for understanding {{the evolution of the}} bifurcates for short-term management purposes and forlong-term fluvial plain development. However, measured sediment transports in rivers rarely show a uniquely determined relation with hydrodynamicparameters. Commonly a hysteresis is observed of transport rate as a function of discharge or shear stress which cannot be explained with thestandard sediment transport predictor approach. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the causes of hysteresis at a bifurcation of the lowerRhine river, a meandering river with stable banks, large dunes during flood, and poorly sorted bed sediment. The hydrodynamics and bedsediment transport were measured in detail during a discharge wave with a recurrence interval larger than 10 years. Surprisingly, the hysteresisin <b>bedload</b> against <b>discharge</b> was in the opposite direction upstream and downstream of the bifurcation. The upstream clockwise hysteresis iscaused by the lagging development of dunes during the flood. The counter-clockwise hysteresis downstream of the bifurcation is caused by acombination of processes in addition to dune lagging, namely 1) formation of a scour zone upstream of the bifurcation, causing a migrating finesediment wave, and 2) vertical bed sorting of the bed sediment by dunes with avalanching lee-sides, together leading to surface-sediment finingand increased transport during and after the flood. These findings lead to challenges for future morphological models, particularly forbifurcations, which will have to deal with varying discharge, sediment sorting in the channel bed, lagging dunes and related hydraulic roughness...|$|R

40|$|Considerable {{quantities}} of iron-smelting slag {{are present in}} the bed of the Ardennian rivers. These waste products come from hundreds of ironworks (mainly blast furnaces and finery forges) built close to different-sized rivers between the 14 th and the 19 th centuries. In general, slag was crushed by hammers, sorted and piled up in heaps around the furnaces, generally onto the floodplains. Furthermore, some archives mention that they were sometimes thrown out directly into the rivers. This means that for centuries, slag elements have been swept away by floods, mixed with the sediment and spread out along river courses. Due to their distinctive appearance, slag particles are easily recognizable among the natural elements. Thanks to many historical studies conducted on the early iron industry, we are able to date quite precisely the inception and the periods of activity of the different sites established in the catchments. These data are indispensable in order to use slag as a tracer to quantify the particles’ velocity in rivers. Downstream of ironworks, samples of sand have been collected in the surface layer of many gravel-bed rivers. Then, the slag concentration of each sample has been measured in the coarse sand fraction. The representation of the longitudinal evolution of slag concentration in these rivers permits the dispersion of slag to be analysed, the relative bed-material discharges at confluences to be quantified and the velocity of coarse sand to be determined. A survey of the <b>bedload</b> <b>discharge</b> in the Ardennian rivers established that more than 90 % of the bedload transport consists of coarse sand grains that are transported {{on the bottom of the}} bed. However, in the literature, this grain-size fraction is generally not considered in <b>bedload</b> <b>discharge</b> estimations because the sandy particles are very difficult to tag and to recover. Consequently, the huge amounts of slag injected in rivers several centuries ago can be considered as a very useful opportunity to characterise the sand transport in gravel-bed rivers.

40|$|Sediment {{transport}} {{occurring in}} small, high-gradient streams {{is one of}} the most important aspects to be evaluated for land use planning in mountain areas. The research was conducted in two experimental catchments, comparable for dimensions. The Rio Cordon is a small basin in the Dolomites (Italian Alps). Since 1986 an instrumented site has been operating to measure flow <b>discharge,</b> <b>bedload</b> and suspended sediment transport. In September 1994, an extraordinary (TR> 50 years) flood produced 900 m 3 of coarse sediment and clearly affected the successive sediment transport: 1996, 1998 and 2000 ordinary floods showed higher sediment loads compared to similar pre- 1994 floods. The Tres Arroyos is a 5. 93 km 2 Andean catchment (Chile). Water discharge, suspended and coarse sediment load have been monitored since 1997.

Hand-held, pressure difference, Helley-Smith bedload samplers {{were used to}} measure bedload fluxes for the 1998 / 1999, 1999 / 2000, 2000 / 2001 and 2001 / 2002 wet seasons. Rainfall is strongly seasonal over the Ngarradj Creek catchment, being concentrated in the wet season between November and April. Mean annual point rainfall between 1998 and 2007 for the water year, September to August, inclusive varied over the Ngarradj Creek catchment from 1731 ± 98 mm (SE) to 1754 ± 116 mm. Between 190 and 440 mm of rainfall are required before streamflow commences in December in most years. Streamflow persists until at least April. Mean annual runoff, {{as a percentage of}} mean annual rainfall, decreases slightly with increasing catchment area. Bedload ratings were calculated for four data sets. Significant bedload ratings were defined as those that were not only statistically significant (ρ ⩽ 0. 05) but also explained at least 0. 60 of the variance in bedload flux. For the three stations, twenty-three bedload ratings complied with the above criteria. Sixteen equations were accepted for East Tributary, four bedload ratings were accepted for Upper Swift Creek and three bedload ratings were accepted for Swift Creek. Significant bedload ratings were established between <b>bedload</b> flux and <b>discharge,</b> unit <b>bedload</b> flux and <b>discharge,</b> transport rate of unsuspended bedload by immersed weight per unit width and time and both unit and excess unit stream power, and finally, adjusted submersed bedload weight and both unit and excess unit stream power for raw and log₁₀-transformed data. ‘Censored data sets’ were compiled for Upper Swift Creek and Swift Creek to include only bedload fluxes measured when there was no apparent scour or fill so that there were no changes in sand supply from the catchment (i. e. equilibrium conditions). Bedload sediments are similar at all sites. There is little difference in grain size statistics between wet season bedload and dry season bed material. The differences which were significant suggest that most of the bed material is transported as bedload during the wet season. Size selective transport occurs at all three gauging stations with bedload being better sorted than bed material and the coarsest fraction (Cobble gravel) is mobile only during extreme events...|$|R
40|$|Field {{verification}} of {{the applicability of}} bedload predictive formulas to coarse-bedload high-gradient mountain streams has received relatively little study as compared to similar work in sand bed streams. This study attempted to verify the applicability of two types of predictive <b>bedload</b> formulas, a <b>discharge</b> type and a tractive force type, to Squaw Creek, a coarse bedload high-gradient mountain stream. The Schoklitsch (1934) formula was chosen as a discharge type and the Meyer-Peter and Muller (1948) formula was selected as a tractive force type. The predictions of these formulas were also compared to predictions generated from Bagnold's simple theoretical expression for unit stream power. Discharge, water surface slope, bed slope, water density, bedload particle size and bedload quantity were measured instantaneously during the 1983 and 1984 bedload transport events. A technique, which proved very successful, was developed for simultaneously measuring water surface and bed slope. The appropriate parameters were substituted into the formulas and the resulting predicted quantity of bedload was compared to the quantity actually measured in the stream. Field observations of channel features and changes in channel morphology were made to enable explanations for any variance between predictions and measurements...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Presentation date: 1979 - 11 - 06 Sediment {{transport}} {{measurements on}} Flynn Creek, a headwater stream in the Oregon Coast Range, have illustrated {{the magnitude of}} fluvial transfer processes, primarily of the bedload component, during a moderate storm runoff season (1979 water year). The total dissolved solids concentration of storm runoff averaged 40 mg/L, and was independent of water discharge. Most particulate export from the 202 ha forested watershed occurred during the annual peak flow of 0. 75 m³/sec-km² (2 -year return interval). Suspended load {{was the most important}} transport mode, with a total yield of 5. 7 x l 0 ⁴ kg during the 24 h peak flow period. The export of coarse particulate organic matter during the same period was 1. 5 x 10 ³ kg. <b>Bedload</b> <b>discharge,</b> as measured with vortex tube and Helley-Smith samplers, occurred in pulses of short duration that did not necessarily coincide with peak streamflow. For the same 24 h storm runoff period, the total bedload yield {{at the mouth of the}} watershed was only 2. 6 x 10 ³ kg (particles > 0. 25 mm), and consisted primarily of sand-size material. <b>Bedload</b> <b>discharge</b> at an upstream site (1. 3 x 10 ⁴ kg) was dominated by gravel-size particles. Channel morphology and in-stream obstructions (organic debris, fish trap) appear to cause significant spatial and temporal variations in sediment transport and streambed composition. Although streamflow was the principal variable controlling sediment transport, results suggest that supply limitations exist. The supply of transportable materials is dependent on the retention characteristics of the stream channel and on local hydraulic conditions. The discharge of both suspended solids and coarse particulate organic matter peaked early in the storm; however, pulses of the latter component on the recession limb appeared to be related to streambed disturbances. Bedload movement is an important process regulating both bed composition and particulate yields in this Coast Range stream. The Helley-smith sampler was the preferable method for use in streams having a large fraction of bedload in the sand-size range. The vortex tube trapped from 60 - 70...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{defining}} sediment supply conditions is of fundamental {{importance in the}} prediction of <b>bedload</b> <b>discharge</b> in alluvial channels, because most bedload equations were developed based on the general assumption that the rates at which sediment becomes available for transport equal the sediment-transport capacity of the flow. The classification of availability of sediment on the accuracy and applicability of seven bedload equations in alluvial channels is described and discussed in this dissertation. Historical hydraulic and sedimentological data from 22 alluvial channels of the United States are used to define the sediment-transport regimes and to compare predicted and measured bedload discharges. Exponential relations between sediment supply end energy are used to show if at a reach scale a channel has supply-limited or non-supply limited regime based on the statistical variations of bedload-transport rates with stream power. The root-mean-square error and the inequality coefficients are use to assess the bedload equation's ability to reproduce the trend of the measured values, whereas the discrepancy ratio is {{used to evaluate the}} equation's ability to reproduce individual measured data. Relations between the median particle-size ratio, which quantifies the coarseness or fineness of the channel bed, and the discrepancy ratio are used to illustrate process controlling the accuracy of bedload equations.

Both burned in 1946 and both are still characterized by severe vegetation destruction. Sparsely grass-covered rock and debris slopes have developed replacing the former dwarf pine (Pinus mugo) shrub stands. Our aim was to establish disturbed and undisturbed erosion rates and to decide whether recent debris flows can be assigned to these historical wildfires or not. We measured fluvial erosion by means of collectors, estimated the amount of post-fire erosion from stratigraphic exposures in the adjacent talus, modelled <b>bedload</b> <b>discharge</b> with a statistical model developed in a nearby study area and quantified recent debris flow activity by combining airborne and terrestrial laser scans.

Slopewash was higher than linear fluvial transport in the four years of our investigation. Surplus material was removed from the channels by avalanches and debris flows; both being more important for the sediment budget than fluvial action. The modelling approach allowed measured sediment yields to be transferred to larger slope parts and to calculate scenarios of pre-fire conditions. The concordance of measured and modelled yields was reasonably good; deviations may be explained by differing amounts of precipitation.

The collected bedload and suspended sediment transport data allows sediment dynamics {{to be analyzed}} at different time scales, ranging from short- (single event) to long-term (three decades). The Rio Cordon monitoring station has been operating since 1986, continuously recording water <b>discharge,</b> <b>bedload</b> and suspended load. At the flood event scale, a good relationshipwas found between peak discharges (Qpeak) andsediment load (bedload and suspended load). The inter-annual sediment yields were analyzed, also assessing {{the contribution of the}} single floods to the total sediment budget. The annual suspended load ranges from 10 to 2524 t yr− 1, while the bedload varies from 0 to 1543 t yr− 1. The higher annual yields were recorded in the years when large floods occurred, highlighting that the sediment budget in the Rio Cordon is strongly controlled by the occurrence of high magnitude events. Investigation of the seasonal suspended load contribution demonstrated that from 1986 to 1993 most fine sediments were transported during the snowmelt/summer seasons, while autumn and snowmelt were the dominant seasons contributing to sediment yield in the periods 1994 – 2002 and 2003 – 2014, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In recent years, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that bedload transport fluctuates over time in steep rivers, with wide grain size distributions. This phenomenon is perceived even under constant sediment feed and water <b>discharge.</b> <b>Bedload</b> pulses are periodical and are a consequence of grain sorting. Furthermore, along with bedload transport, other parameters fluctuate in time as flow velocity and bed morphology. The influence of macro-roughness elements on these fluctuations has not been studied yet, even though it is widely accepted that the presence of large relatively immobile boulders, such as erratic blocks often present in mountain streams, has a strong impact on flow conditions and sediment transport. In the present work, the influence of the presence of these boulders on sediment transport and flow conditions is investigated with a set of laboratory experiments carried out in a 8 m long, 0. 25 m wide tilting flume (analyzed slopes S range between 6. 7 % and 13. 1 %). Constant sediment and water discharge were supplied into the flume at the upstream section, for tests duration reaching 250 minutes. Experiments included the use of various boulder diameters (D= 0. 075 - 0. 125 m) and dimensionless distances between them (λ/D= 2 - 5, where λ is the average distance between boulders).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was threefold: 1) to improve the values of bedload mobilisation discharge in gravel bed rivers, 2) to determine the bedload velocity over the short and long term and 3) to quantify bedload transport and to examine <b>bedload</b> <b>discharge</b> in relation to the stream power and to the excess stream power. Since 2006, we used the PIT-tag technique in order to mark pebbles from Ardennian rivers. Ten rivers of different geomorphological properties were fitted out with PIT-tags (in 18 different sites) and 67 surveys were carried out after hydrological events. These data allow a valuable relationship between the stream power during floods {{and the size of the}} biggest elements mobilised to be proposed. This relation is obtained for medium sized rivers (50 - 200 km²) with bed material composed of gravel (D 50 between 2 and 10 cm). Furthermore, we also obtained good relationships between the average transport distance and the excess of stream power reached during the hydrological events. In order to estimate the bedload virtual velocity over a longer time scale, we applied these relationships to the hydrological events recorded by gauging stations over more than 30 years. We obtained values of virtual velocity which are between 2 km/century for a low energy river with a sinuous bed and well developed riffle-pool sequences (Rulles River – 20 W/m² at Qb) and 11 km/century in a more powerful river with a straight channel (Aisne River – 100 W/m² at Qb) and a sub-flat bed. The propagation velocity of bedload is therefore influenced by the energy available. However, it is also necessary to take into account the river pattern, the characteristics of the armoured layer and the presence of potential trapping sites. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Presentation date: 1982 - 06 - 02 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} at portions of Trap Bay Creek, a medium-sized third-order stream on Chichagof Island, Southeast Alaska, to 1) quantify short-term sediment transport and channel morphology changes, 2) relate measured sediment transport rates to the major hydrologic parameters that appeared to determine the mechanisms of sediment transport, and 3) evaluate how bedload transport can influence channel morphology. Morphologic characteristics were evaluated by means of plani-metric surveys and cross-sectional measurements made in July and August of 1980 and August of 1981. Bedload and suspended sediment data were collected during the Fall of 1980 along with data on streamflow and precipitation. Morphologic evaulations indicated that the stream is a dynamic system and that {{it appeared to be}} widening and aggrading during 1980 - 81. Large organic debris, especially fallen trees, are important in stream morphology, especially above the zone of tidal influence. The tides, as well as human activity, probably contributed to recent morphological changes in lower reaches of the channel. Problems involved in processing suspended sediment samples resulted in a limited amount of suspended sediment data. However, data that were collected from one point on the stream indicated that suspended sediment concentrations were low, usually less than 5 mg· 1 ⁻¹, and did not exceed 90 mg· 1 ⁻¹ during an approximate 2 to 5 -year return interval storm event. Under average storm conditions, therefore, suspended sediment transport appears to be supply limited and constitutes a small portion of total sediment transport. Bedload sediment samples were collected from a short pool-riffle study reach during a total of ten storms with streaflow ranging from 0. 01 to 1. 26 m³·s⁻¹·km⁻². Bedload sediment transport ranged from 3. 9 to 4400 kg·hr⁻¹, with peak transport rates occurring during peak streamflow. Regression relationships were developed between bedload transport, gravel-sized inorganic bedload transport, coarse particulate organic matter transport, two particle size diameter classes (D₅₀ and D₉₀), and stream discharge during the ten storms. This analysis revealed that total inorganic- bedload transport was more strongly related to discharge than was transport of the large size category, coarse particulate organic matter transport tended to be more strongly related to streamflow than <b>bedload</b> <b>discharge,</b> and that neither of the particle size diameters had any consistent relationship to streaflow. Bedload transport during the ten storms was further evaluated in terms of the sampling sites that were used, i. e. riffles above and below a depositional area approximately 20 m in length. Transport tended to be greater, in terms of amount transported, at the upper riffle for most of the storm events. The opposite was true during the largest storm of the season and a storm which occurred a week later. It may be that bedload sediment is transported past the upper riffle by lesser magnitude events and is temporarily stored in the pool. Transport out of the pool requires events of greater magnitude. Supply limitations also appear to determine bedload transport in Trap Bay Creek...|$|E

The relationship between environmental variables and macroinvertebrate assemblages, however, has rarely been examined quantitatively for rivers with high stream power at high altitude. In this study, stream power was analyzed in relation to macroinvertebrate distributions in the Yarlung Tsangpo River Basin on the Tibetan Plateau. Field investigations were carried out at 22 sites in April, 2014 and 2015. Stream power, substrate size and evenness, <b>discharge,</b> <b>bedload</b> transport, and organic detritus availability varied greatly among these sites. In total, 125 taxa of macroinvertebrates belonging to 48 families and 104 genera were identified. The macroinvertebrate density was negatively and significantly correlated with the stream power (D = 3. 30, P < 0. 001). Both the assemblage indices (taxa richness, density, biomass, and the Improved Shannon–Wiener Index) and the environmental variables (elevation, substrate size, and discharge) differed among the sites with different levels of stream power. An adaptability analysis showed contrasting adaptive strengths of typical taxa. Orthocladius, Baetis, and Simulium adapted to wide ranges of stream power and their most optimal stream powers were relatively high, while Bethbilbeckia and Natarsia were only well-adapted to fairly narrow ranges in stream power. Some macroinvertebrates have evolved specific strategies to adapt to high stream power: Baetidae and Heptageniidae have developed specialized body shapes, and Epoicocladius has altered its host preference. The stream power {{has been shown to}} be significantly correlated with and could be used to predict macroinvertebrate density in the Yarlung Tsangpo River Basin. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Braided Cascade {{has been}} {{developed}} from Cascade (Braun and Sambridge, (1997), a long-term (dt = 100 years) numerical model that simulates long-term landscape evolution. Herein it has been modified and applied to relatively short term process modelling {{of the evolution of}} complex river topography, discharge and sediment load of braided rivers. Braided Cascade is synthesist in spirit, there is no detailed hydrodynamic component to the model, a realistic simplification at the time scales considered. The major advantage of the model is the incorporation of an irregular time-varying grid using a triangulated irregular network (TIN) to represent a terrain surface. Advantages of using TINs include the ability to solve problems with non-rectangular geometeries and/or boundary conditions and the ability of river segments to form in all directions. The model routes water from node to node based on the local topographic slope. Sediment transport depends on the local stream power. Nodal elevation changes after each iteration according to the difference between the amount of sediment entering and leaving the node. Model output includes spatial and temporal (at one point) water <b>discharge,</b> <b>bedload</b> sediment transport, as well as maps of channel networks, erosion and deposition throughout the reach. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the most significant parameters for braiding are erosion length scale, splitting ratios and the allowance of the model to deposit sediment. Therefore an imbalance in the amount of sediment the river is carrying and the carrying capacity AND a reworking of the deposits is needed for a braided network to form. Sediment output from model runs indicate that the similarities between model data and other data sets are weak and all runs tended to reach static equilibrium. Braided Cascade therefore failed to adequately reproduce realistic data sets. It was found that the differences between model results and the flume data indicate that the model does not always match the physical systems as closely as physical systems match each other...|$|R

Interactions between catchment variables and sediment transport processes in rivers are complex, and sediment transport behaviour during high-flow events is not well documented. This paper presents an investigation into sediment transport processes in a short-duration, high-discharge event in the Burdekin River, a large sand- and gravel-bed river in the monsoon- and cycloneinfluenced, semi-arid tropics of north Queensland. The Burdekin’s discharge is highly variable and strongly seasonal, with a recorded maximum of 40 400 m 3 s) 1. Sediment was sampled systematically across an 800 m wide, 12 m deep and straight reach using Helley-Smith bedload and US P- 61 suspended sediment samplers over 16 days of a 29 -day discharge event in February and March 2000 (peak 11 155 m 3 s) 1). About 3 Æ 7 · 106 tonnes of suspended sediment and 3 · 105 tonnes of bedload are estimated to have been transported past the sample site during the flow event. The sediment load was predominantly supply limited. Wash load included clay, silt and very fine sand. The concentration of suspended bed material (including very coarse sand) varied with <b>bedload</b> transport rate, <b>discharge</b> and height above the bed. Bedload transport rate and changes in channel shape were greatest several days after peak discharge. Comparison between these data and sparse published data from other events on this river shows that the control on sediment load varies between supply limited and hydraulically limited transport, and that antecedent weather is an important control on suspended sediment concentration. Neither the empirical relationships widely used to estimate suspended sediment concentrations and bedload (e. g. Ackers & White, 1973) nor observations of sediment transport characteristics in ephemeral streams (e. g. Reid & Frostick, 1987) are directly applicable to this river. Kathryn J.

40|$|Sand {{extraction}} {{from the}} bed of the lower Waikato River has occurred over the past three decades, primarily {{to meet the demands of}} the Auckland construction industry. The extraction has affected bed levels over large areas of the river. From analysis of the Waikato Catchment Board's periodic river channel cross sectional surveys degradation of river bed levels is seen to be occurring in the Puni to Huntly reach as a result sand extraction and river training, and in the Karapiro to Hamilton reach as a result of construction of the Karapiro dam. Noticeable degradation has occurred since 1964, and the rate has increased between the most recent bed level surveys, 1981 to 1987. The river level has lowered to an extent where further lowering will hinder the operation of water intake structures at the Huntly Power Station, and promote drainage of the Whangamarino wetlands. From the interpretation of echo sounding traces, aerial photographs and field observations it is seen that sand bar, dune and ripple bedforms exist in the lower Waikato River. Two distinct dune populations exist, a short steep group with a ripple index (λ/h) of about 24 and a long flat group with a ripple index of about 40. Sand bar bedforms, which have previously been loosely referred to as 'dunes', dominate the Huntly to Mercer reach and are related to a sinuous thalweg pattern. The bars also exist in two forms, with straight or strongly curved crests. A relationship between flow discharge and the rate of bar migration exists. However, at high flows(~> 600 m³/s) the bars become rounded and the crests undefineable. The river bed is devoid of detectable bedform (h < 0. 1 m) immediately downstream of sand extraction sites. Using the relationship between <b>bedload</b> transport and <b>discharge</b> determined from bar migration in the present study, and a similar relationship developed previously (Finley, 1974), an estimate of medium term (for the period 1975 - 1989) bedload transport is 180 000 m³/yr. Several bedload transport functions were applied to the lower Waikato River. Colby's Relations (1964) was found to be the most applicable mathematical approach as it provided estimates of bedload transport comparable to those estimated from bar migration. The Karapiro dam has blocked the major supply of bedload, so the bedload transport rate can be expected to drop in future. The bottom sediments of the lower Waikato River are predominantly coarse poorly sorted pumiceous sands. There is no significant difference in textural statistics between the Mercer and Puni areas. The Puni area has a shallow pre-fluvial basal unit, thereby limiting the useful resource to 7 - 9 m³/ m² of river bed. No pre-fluvial unit was found in the Mercer area. A sedimentation rate of 2. 8 mm/yr since the Taupo eruption was inferred from stratigraphic data. From the results and interpretations in this study, continued sand extraction at the present rate at Mercer will promote further bed level lowering, and operations would be better concentrated in the tidally influenced areas around Puni. It is recommended that future cross sectional surveys should be conducted more regularly (2 - 3 yrs) and each survey should be completed over a shorter period (4 - 6 weeks), and regular future assessment of bedload transport should be made. A need exists for further research into the effects of sand extraction and management of the lower Waikato River...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the downstream {{changes in the}} character of the Gwydir distributary system which flows across the Gwydir fan-plain, a large (~ 7500 km 2) low gradient alluvial surface which forms part of the Darling Riverine Plains of southeastern Australia. The Late Quaternary history of the distributary system is evaluated by investigating the chronology and probable discharges of palaeochannels at or near the surface of the fan-plain. Channels of the contemporary distributary system are characterized by downstream declining discharges, in part a result of the interaction of the modern system with remnants of the preceding palaeochannel systems. The hydraulic geometry of the contemporary channels revealed that these distributaries do not have a uniform response to declining discharge, with differences in heights of off-takes leading to differences in sedimentology, hydrology and channel morphology. Of the four distributaries, the Gwydir River is the bedload transporting trunk stream, hence its hydraulic geometry is fundamentally influenced by the need to maintain <b>bedload</b> conveyance as <b>discharge</b> declines downstream. It maintains a relatively deep channel facilitated in part by adoption of an anabranching habit in its lower reaches, and by relatively continuous flow that keeps its bed free of vegetation. Hence it has a relatively low W/D ratio. Contrary to an expectation for clay dominated bedload-free channels with banks of high material strength, depth in the Mehi, Moomin and Carole declines relatively rapidly downstream with little or no change in width. This results in large increases in W/D ratio downstream. It appears that long intervals of no flow in these three distributaries with their elevated off-takes encourage the growth of dense sturdy vegetation on their beds, directing flow energy to the banks during flood events. Planform analyses show that bend radius of curvature and meander wavelength are strongly correlated with discharge, channel depth and flow velocity, but are poorly correlated with width. Width appears to be responding to conditions other than discharge, probably the presence of within-channel vegetation. The negative correlation between sinuosity and unit stream power, and between sinuosity and apparent bank strength, indicate that an increase in channel width allows or indeed requires a decrease in gradient through meandering. Analyses of the palaeochannels of the Gwydir fan-plain revealed that alluvial quartz grains here are unsuitable for traditional thermoluminescence analysis, as it is invariably heavily contaminated with inclusions of feldspar which causes severe age underestimation. An alternative single-grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) method shows that downstream fluvial transport of quartz in contemporary channels increases its luminescence sensitivity due to repeated cycles of burial and exposure. Three potential applications of this finding are; a) sediment tracing, b) river hydrology description and c) palaeochannel connectivity analysis Application of the revised OSL technique reveals that the palaeochannels {{on the surface of the}} Gwydir fan-plain date from at least 70 ka. The oldest, the Challicum, dates to Oxygen Isotope Stage 4 (OIS 4) and shows limited surface preservation so no reliable palaeohydrological estimates could be made. The largest preserved palaeochannel system, the Coocalla unit with a palaeodischarge of ~ 2550 m 3 s- 1, dates to mid OIS 3 (~ 45 - 35 ka), a time of enhanced fluvial activity across the Murray-Darling basin and nearby coastal systems. Two more well preserved palaeochannels, the Kookabunna and Kamilaroi, were both active during OIS 2 (~ 20 � 15 ka) with discharges of ~ 1240 m 3 s- 1 and ~ 1310 m 3 s- 1, respectively. A period of enhanced aeolian activity has been identified at ~ 4 ka, followed by the establishment of the contemporary system, with a total combined channel capacity mid-fan of ~ 200 m 3 s- 1. The Gwydir fan-plain reveals a Late Quaternary history of flow regime decline by approximately an order of magnitude. The present system of greatly reduced flow competence responds to a marked downstream reduction in discharge with a set of spatial hydraulic geometry and planform changes that are clearly not simply the inverse of more usual systems where discharge increases downstream...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 A {{descriptive}} {{model of}} bed material routing {{was developed for}} alluvial streams exhibiting sequences of pools and armored riffles. The model assumes that channel geometry, sediment transport competence {{and the availability of}} sediments for transport are all non-uniform in the downstream direction. Bedload transport is described as occurring in two relatively distinct phases. Phase I involves the transport of predominantly sand-sized bed materials over stable riffles. Phase II occurs at flows which are greater than those required to entrain riffle armor and involves the transport of riffle sediments in addition to Phase I sediments. Phase I bedload transport was sampled during three high flow events at Flynn Creek, a 2 km², third order drainage in the Oregon Coast Range and at Huntington Creek in the Wasatch Plateau of central Utah during a controlled release of water from Electric Lake reservoir. A power relationship existed between Phase I <b>bedload</b> transport and <b>discharge</b> at Flynn Creek. The relationship was consistent between storms and between years. At Huntington Creek, Phase I bedload transport correlated with discharge on the rising limb of the hydrograph, but transport rates decreased over time at constant discharge, indicating a sediment supply control over Phase I transport. Phase II bedload transport was sampled at Flynn Creek during a 1. 8 year return period streamflow event in February, 1979. Bedload transport rates were closely correlated with the storage and release of bed material from the riffle at the bedload sampling cross section; transport peaks corresponded to periods of scour and large decreases in transport occurred during periods of deposition. Particle size analysis of the bed material in transport showed as much as a 12 -fold increase in the transport of large (> 12. 5 mm diameter) bed material during periods of riffle scour. Phase II transport, which involves rapid scour and redeposition of riffles, can be described as highly non-uniform in a downstream direction and highly unsteady at any point over time. At Flynn Creek, significant scour and redeposition of riffles can be expected to occur on an average of once every one to two years. Corresponding to the two phases of bedload transport are two processes which result in changes in the particle size composition of riffle sediments. First, the intrusion of fine sediments into the pore spaces of stable riffles dominates during Phase I transport. Second, the deposition of entirely new riffle features occurs during Phase II transport. Deposition is often associated with one or more streambed scour and fill sequences and is the direct result of instantaneous differences in sediment transport rates between different channel locations. The particle size gradation of riffles is determined primarily by bed material deposition. Sampling at Flynn Creek indicated that a riffle contains the range of sediment sizes found in transport at the time of deposition but, over all, is more coarse than the particle size distribution of sediment in transport. In flume studies of the deposition process, riffle composition was shown {{to be sensitive to the}} rate of sediment transport at the time of deposition [...] becoming more coarse at lower transport rates. Small but significant (p = 0. 95) decreases in the median particle diameter of riffle sediments resulted as the sediment mixture in transport increased from a 1 : 1 to a 5 : 1 sand-to-gravel ratio. Flume studies showed the intrusion process to be selective towards finer sediments which cannot be filtered by the riffle sediment matrix. Intrusion may decrease or even cease if filterable sediments block surface pores in riffle substrate. Intrusion, if it occurs, is a function of two factors: (1) the pore size distribution of the stable riffle feature, and (2) the particle size distribution and concentration of suspended and Phase I bedload sediments in transport immediately above the streambed...|$|R
40|$|Large dams {{commonly}} {{alter the}} natural regimes of hydrologic and sediment {{processes that are}} critical {{for the maintenance of}} native instream and riparian communities, often affecting landscapes hundreds of kilometers from the dam. California has over 1, 400 large dams, some of which have been in place for over 100 years. As a consequence, the legacy of large dam construction has greatly altered California's natural hydrologic and sediment processes. Previous attempts to estimate the effects of multiple large dams on sediment processes have ignored two key factors for large spatial and temporal modeling: sediment trapping due to multiple dams in the same watershed and decreasing sediment trapping as reservoirs fill. Here, I develop a spreadsheet-based model that incorporates both factors. Using California as a case study, measured sedimentation rates first were used to estimate sediment yields for distinct geomorphic regions and the rates then were applied to unmeasured reservoirs by region. The results of the model show that statewide reservoirs have likely filled with 2. 1 billion m 3 of sediment to date, decreasing total reservoir capacity by 4. 5 %. In addition, approximately 200 reservoirs have likely lost more than half their initial capacity to sedimentation. Fourteen of the fifteen major tributaries to the Sacramento-San Joaquin river system in California are dammed by "foothill" dams, very large dams situated {{at the base of the}} mountain fronts. Constructed primarily in the 1940 s- 1970 s, the foothill dams include some of the largest dams in the United States. In addition to blocking access to migrating endangered salmonids, the dams have further altered downstream hydrologic and sediment processes by changing flow-duration and frequencies and releasing sediment-free flows. There has been no comprehensive effort to evaluate the long-term changes in magnitude and frequency of sediment transport downstream of these dams, despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent on restoration efforts. In this study, I evaluate the different effects of the foothill dams on downstream rivers using hydrologic analyses of pre- and post-dam flows, calculations of bedload transport from an extensive literature search and field data, and field observations using gravel tracer and monitored cross sections from water year 2006 (WY 2006) to test the results of the bedload transport calculations. From the results of the hydrologic analysis, the average reduction in the 2 -year return interval flow for the dams is 65 %, however, there is a wide range in the results, with some post-dam flows remaining equal to pre-dam magnitudes, particularly at larger return intervals. Using topographic data and tracer gravel collected during water year 2006, extensive gravel movement was observed downstream of the dams, indicating that even after 50 + years of operation, the riverbeds below the dams are continuing to transport sediment and still are responding to the cessation in supply. From the calculation of bedload transport for each of the major tributaries, post-dam annual bedload transport has fallen by an average of 45 %, with total bedload of particles greater than 8 mm decreasing by 42 %. Some rivers, while having reductions in flood flows, had increases in bedload transport downstream of the dam, primarily due to increases in medium-magnitude medium-frequency events. Bedload is still transported at high rates for most sites, with eleven of the fourteen rivers transporting more than 100, 000 m 3 / yr in the post-dam period. Effective discharge in these channels is difficult to determine due to confounding factors, however, the majority of the rivers have a high-percentage of total <b>bedload</b> transported at <b>discharges</b> larger than the 5 -year return interval suggesting that higher discharge events tend to dominate the channel response. A sediment budget was constructed for both coarse and total sediment for each of the fourteen major tributaries to the Sacramento-San Joaquin river system downstream of the major "foothill" dams. The methods used to construct the sediment budget include a reservoir sedimentation model, bedload transport equations, and suspended and bedload measurements from gaging stations. The results of the sediment budget indicate a volume of approximately 244 million m 3 of sediment is trapped behind dams in the upper watersheds, and 4. 0 million m 3 is trapped by the dams each year. With the exception of the mainstem Sacramento River, very little bedload material is supplied by smaller tributaries to the gravel-bed reaches downstream of the foothill dams. Ten of the fourteen rivers do not have enough supply from small tributaries to meet the calculated average annual bedload transport. Several of the rivers (Putah Creek, the Mokelumne River, and the San Joaquin River) may be strongly affected by small tributaries downstream of the dams because they have relatively large watersheds downstream of the dams and highly reduced post-dam transport ability. Approximately 267, 000 m 3 of gravel has been artificially augmented into Sacramento-San Joaquin tributaries downstream of the foothill dams through 2004. While gravel augmentation projects have been extensive on six of the rivers, they are minimal or absent on the other eight rivers. Overall, gravel is augmented at only 3. 7 % of the post-dam bedload transport capacity, however, some rivers with highly reduced flows have had gravel augmented at rates that approach the post-dam gravel transport rate, primarily due to the large post-dam reduction in bedload transport...|$|R
