As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really {{trying to get the}} puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw it go in, so I jumped.|$|E
5|$|It's about obsession, {{and that}} can be scary because you're not in control and you don't know where it's going to stop. It says that, at any point in {{somebody}}'s life, when they loved somebody strongly enough and that person returns, a certain touch, a certain physical gesture can turn them from being defiant and disgusted with this person to being subservient again. And it's not just a pleasurable feeling that comes back, it's the complete terror and loss of control that comes <b>back.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> think that's ultimately a great weapon.|$|E

That's more than a city block. Now, I put the sweat of my life into this thing.

He later decided that it would be Rihanna, saying, [...] "I was like, 'That's dope. That's Rihanna all day'. They sent the song <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> finished producing it.

It was too dark, too subterranean, and much too horrific. I thought it out-poltered Poltergeist. There's not an ounce of my own personal feeling in Temple of Doom." [...] He later added during the Making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom documentary, [...] "Temple of Doom is my least favorite of the trilogy. I look <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> say, 'Well the greatest thing that I got out of that was I met Kate Capshaw.' We married years later and that to me was the reason I was fated to make Temple of Doom." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Liberty Walk" [...] {{was written}} by Cyrus, Nicholas J. Scapa, John Read Fasse, Michael McGinnis, Antonina Armato and Tim James. It was {{produced}} by the latter three under their stage name Rock Mafia. The song serves as the opening track of Can't Be Tamed (2010). In an interview with Sway Calloway for MTV News, Cyrus explained the lyrical inspiration of the song which is about female empowerment, saying: [...] "It's just about freeing yourself from anything you think is holding you <b>back.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> think that's really important, especially for girls, {{because so many people}} are told, 'No, you can't do something,' or, 'You need to be this because Mom and Dad say that, teachers say this.'" [...] Upon the making of the song, Cyrus stated in the same interview that she tried to combine a serious topic with a lighter sound, explaining: [...] "I wrote it for women that feel like they're stuck in abusive relationships, but it's a dance song". She elaborated: [...] "So you think that must be kind of a sad ballad, but it's a party song. ... It's about breaking free." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{teenager}} {{struggling to}} find his place in life ever since his parents disappeared {{when he was a}} child. A spider bites him {{on the back of his}} neck, giving him spider-powers. He becomes Spider-Man. Garfield described Parker as someone he can relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him since he was little. [...] Garfield drew from his life experiences as inspiration for the role, revealing, [...] "I was thinking of my history and thinking of the kid at school who I wasn't as strong as, who behaved badly to a lot of people– including myself– and who I constantly tried to stand up to but never had the physical prowess to". Discussing his predecessor, Garfield said he respects Tobey Maguire as an actor and that when he first saw Maguire play Spider-Man he [...] "was blown away by his interpretation." [...] Garfield said in interviews, including one in which he was interviewed by Maguire, that when he watched the film Spider-Man when he was younger, he would jokingly recite Maguire's lines in the mirror with a friend who joked that he would never be Spider-Man. On accepting the role Garfield explained, [...] "I see it as a massive challenge in many ways... To make it authentic. To make the character live and breathe in a new way. The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character. I do, as well. I'm probably going to be the guy in the movie theater shouting abuse at myself. But I have to let that go. No turning <b>back.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't want to." [...] After taking the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them, saying Parker is [...] "a boy/spider in terms of how he moves, and not just in the suit." [...] He did yoga and Pilates for the role in order to be as flexible as possible. When first wearing his costume Garfield admitted to shedding tears and trying to imagine [...] "a better actor in the suit", which he described as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] and admitted to wearing nothing beneath it since it is skintight. When filming Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as terribly challenging and exhausting.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "“The Dark Swan” was a {{tremendous}} premiere for Once Upon A Time, because it played with {{the structure of the}} series to breathe new life into it. Instead of a flashback, we get a flash forward that future flashbacks will illuminate. We'll see how Emma comes to lose her goodness, and how her humanity might be reclaimed. If nothing else, we'll get to see evil Jennifer Morrison, which I'm more than stoked to witness, with what little we got of it tonight. In short, Once Upon A Time is <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't be happier." ...|$|E

According to Lanois, [...] "I said, 'That sounded pretty cool,' so we listened <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said, 'Jesus it's better than I thought.'" [...] The Edge immediately recorded an Infinite Guitar part in two takes. The band considers the song's recording {{to be one of the}} album sessions' breakthrough moments, as it was recorded amidst concerns that they had run out of ideas.|$|E

2500|$|He {{made his}} full {{international}} debut for England on 19 May 1951 against Portugal at Goodison Park, Liverpool, {{and made an}} immediate impression by scoring with his first touch of the ball after only 19 seconds. This proved to be his only international appearance due to injuries, the dominance of Billy Wright, and his habit of putting his club before his country. Nicholson {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "My duty is to get fit for Tottenham. Well, they pay my wages, don't they?". Of his only appearance he said [...] "Stan Pearson nodded it <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> ran on to let go a first time shot which, from the moment I hit it, I knew was going in. But for the next game they brought back Billy Wright and I accepted that because he was the better player". Nicholson is the only player to have scored for England with his first touch in international football and subsequently never play at that level again.|$|E
