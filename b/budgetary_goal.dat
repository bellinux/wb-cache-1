To meet the fiscal objectives {{of these programs}} requires the development of improved transportation logistics, both in the primary Earth-to-Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and secondary orbit-to-orbit space transportation segments for delivery of construction materials, scientific payloads, and personnel. The deployment of space-based orbit transfer vehicles (OTV's) and development of innovative orbit transfer methodologies that reduce secondary cyclic mission support mass requirements (e. g. propellants) is a crucial step in meeting program <b>budgetary</b> <b>goals.</b> The research performed in this thesis has developed an improved efficiency cyclic orbit transfer method, based on non-traditional optimization criteria, {{through the use of}} intermediate propellant depot orbits and rendezvous transfer. The technique was optimized for a reference cyclic transfer between LEO and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) in the presence of realistic mission affects including the following: (1) non-planar transfers; (2) perturbed (non-Keplerian) orbit motions; and (3) mission transfer risk mitigation techniques. A semianalytic model was developed to optimize the depot orbit selection and sizing for LEO/GEO cyclic missions for three NASA reference OTV mission payload profiles. The results demonstrated significant reductions in cyclic mission propellant requirements, when compared to current NASA aerobrake OTV missions, for durations of up to one week in GEO. The magnitude of the propellant mass savings was found to depend on GEO on-orbit durations, mission risk strategies, and payload profiles, with maximum propellant savings amounting to approximately 11 metric tons/mission.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we take {{a closer}} look at the {{promotion}} of social inclusion in the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy, in particular the legal consequences of the incorporation of the social inclusion guidelines under the European Semester. Since the employment guidelines under the Europe 2020 strategy are now connected in a structural way to the economic guidelines, we first look at the monitoring procedures that accompany the implementation of these economic guidelines. Furthermore, we test the potential legal consequences of the integrated approach by unravelling (the formulation of) the social inclusion-related Country Specific Recommendations, and look at to what extent they answer to the economic, employment or social inclusion objectives. The first legal consequence relates to the question of whether and to what extent the harder sanctioning tools, which have been developed for controlling the EU’s economic-oriented Country Specific Recommendations, can be similarly applied to the guidelines relating to social inclusion (such as the application of sanctions in cases when the recommendations are not followed by states). In our opinion, there is a spillover effect only in relation to social inclusion recommendations that have sufficient economic or budgetary relevance (‘social inclusion recommendations of the negative kind’, supporting economic or <b>budgetary</b> <b>goals).</b> In other words, social inclusion recommendations that support only social objectives (or only employment objectives) do not enjoy the stronger legal effects of the integrated monitoring approach. From analysing the concrete Country Specific Recommendations, we demonstrate that the incorporation of social inclusion into the employment guidelines has two additional consequences. On the one hand, social inclusion recommendations are nowadays formulated mainly in terms of employment objectives. On the other hand, the link with social inclusion also has implications for recommendations in the field of employment and economy that should not be to the detriment of social inclusio...|$|R

40|$|Constant monitoring, {{maintenance}} and repair activities are {{needed in order to}} maintain the infrastructure systems in good condition and extend their service lives. However, {{maintenance and}} repair activities alone cannot prevent continuous deterioration of infrastructure systems so that a rehabilitation strategy should be developed. There have been many efforts to determine the optimal rehabilitation time for infrastructure systems using the various optimization models (e. g., project level, network level, or a combination of both that is a combined level). In particular, the optimization models at the network and combined levels require prioritization approaches (e. g., single year, multiyear, or yearly-based multiyear analysis) to prioritize and screen rehabilitation projects within the available budgets. ^ Recent research and practice focus on developing optimization models on the basis of the integration of the project and network level analysis over a long-term <b>budgetary</b> <b>goal.</b> However, they still have limitations as rehabilitation planning models due to: 1) the use of the fixed rehabilitation time identified during the project level analysis leading to decisions that are not optimal at the network level, 2) no consideration of the rehabilitation projects that are not selected within the multiyear prioritization approach due to limited budget, and 3) incompatibility of the required annual rehabilitation cost and the purpose of a multiyear budget approach, i. e., to ensure the predictability of rehabilitation needs. ^ This research suggests a new paradigm for efficient infrastructure management to overcome those challenges. That is, infrastructure management strategy should be established based on the rehabilitation time float and an annual reanalysis process within the context of maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation (MR 2 ̆ 6 R) over a multiyear period. The rehabilitation time float is defined as the acceptable time frame within which a rehabilitation project can be accommodated to develop a leveled annual rehabilitation requirement cost over a multiyear analysis period. ^ Therefore, the research methodology consists of four processes: 1) identification of the best MR 2 ̆ 6 R strategy at the project level, 2) estimation of the time float of rehabilitation projects and development of cost leveling method, 3) multiyear analysis to find an optimal set of rehabilitation projects at the network level, and 4) annual reanalysis for the selection of final rehabilitation projects at a target fiscal year. To demonstrate the research methodology, this dissertation uses concrete bridge decks as a case study in the state of Indiana. The required data was obtained from the national bridge inventory (NBI) database. The suggested multiyear infrastructure rehabilitation strategy using the new paradigm could help public agencies do the following: (a) Identify leveled annual rehabilitation costs that are required to keep the infrastructure systems in good condition. (b) Establish a long-term and steady <b>budgetary</b> <b>goal</b> for rehabilitation programs. (c) Make a more reliable decision for a multiyear rehabilitation program. ...|$|E
40|$|The Austrian Federal {{government}} is striving {{to achieve a}} balanced national budget for 2002. In terms of budgetary distribution, {{it is assumed that}} the Länder (Federal states) will deliver a surplus of 0. 75 percent of GDP, whereas the communities will arrive at a balanced budget. Accordingly, the Federal budget could then have a deficit margin of 0. 75 percent of GDP. The budget proposed for 2002 meets this stability target. Current economic prospects, however, will not help to achieve the objective of a balanced budget. The Federal government attempts to meet its <b>budgetary</b> <b>goal</b> by raising additional (tax) revenues and by instituting savings on the expenditure side. Compared to 2000, the one-time effects on the revenue side of the 2002 budget are markedly lower, {{while at the same time}} the overall tax ratio is rising. Apart from ATS 1 billion, all of the additional revenues from taxation, which are estimated at about ATS 28 billion, will flow into Federal budget. At the same time, the Länder have raised their consolidation contribution to the Federal budget from ATS 2. 29 billion (from 2001) to ATS 4. 29 billion. Federal expenditures show substantial shifts due to budget consolidation. Altogether, both personnel expenses and transfers in the 2002 budget follow the original targets. The preliminary result for 2000 indicates that objectives were met, so that a solid foundation was built for the budgets for 2001 and 2002. The 2002 budget makes it clear that Bundesimmobiliengesellschaft is now investing a substantial part of the funds for construction and buildings which were formerly invested directly under the Federal budget. As a consequence, construction investment is noticeably lower in the Federal budget (at € 197 million in 2002, it is posted at more than 40 percent below the 2000 figure), whereas expenditure on rents has risen by almost € 400 million between 2000 and 2002. Other expenditure items similarly illustrate that the Federal {{government is}} increasingly outsourcing works and services to third parties rather than rendering them directly. Transfer payments are mostly within the scope of social expenditure. More than half of these payments are made to cover old-age pensions. At ATS 177. 3 billion (€ 12. 9 billion) in 2002, they will be 8. 2 percent higher than in 2000. The greater part of this sum is used as Federal contribution to the statutory pension insurance scheme (including equalisation payments) and transfers to the equalisation funds held by the pension insurance institutions. Apart from covering old-age pensions, a substantial share of the transfer payments involves family subsidies. The new child-care benefit (payable as of 2002) will make for a considerable increase of this item. Taking into account the abolishing of the parental leave benefit, the new child-care benefit will call for another ATS 6. 4 billion (€ 0. 46 billion) by 2002. Two components on the expenditure side will make an important contribution to budget consolidation: interest on the national debt and transfer payments to other public bodies. Lower budget deficits will make for interest payments in 2002 at roughly the 2001 level. Payments to other territorial authorities and funds are budgeted at ATS 113. 4 billion in 2002 (compared to ATS 113. 2 billion in 2000), as a consequence of the Federal government's attempt to reduce its financing functions.

40|$|The {{literature}} on the deomposition of mathematical programs as models for organizational design and resource allocation in decentralized organizations is extensive. Although models differ in detail, all conceptualize the allocation problem as a multi-level managerial coordination procedure, involving local (divisional) and global (organization-wide) resources, in which informational automony is to be maintained. That is, coordination of resource usage by relatively autonomous divisions is to be effected in these models without any one agent in the organization accumulating complete knowledge of the technical resource transformations, payoff or cost coefficients and detailed plans that divisions utilize in converting resources to useful ends. Unfortunately {{there has been little}} empirical investigation into the implementational problems of applying these models in decentralized organizations. This study reports on an experiment with human subjects as decision makers in a simulated decentralized organization. The formulation of the overall resource-allocation problem as a linear program permitted two forms of coordination: price-directive in which transfer pricing is used to allocate resources, and resource-directive in which a rationing or budgeting approach is used. Both schemes can be shown to solve the overall organizational problem but impose different information, communication, and decision-making structures upon the subject managers. The experiment was designed to examine comparative managerial performance by the subjects, as central coordinating agents, under the alternative transfer pricing and budgeting schemes. Within each of these schemes two levels of decision time pressure were also introduced to examine its impact upon subject performance. The purpose of the investigation was to study the influence of organizational design (allocation scheme) and situational factors (time pressure) upon human decision-making under carefully controlled experimental conditions. The experimental setting was that of a decentralized university incorporating three subordinate college divisions and one coordinating agent, the president's office. The colleges were modeled as linear programs and the coordination function was assigned to the experimental subjects. In the price-directive scheme a subject assigned a transfer price to each of two global resources in each planning iteration. In the resource-directive scheme a subject directly allocated amounts of the two global resources to each of the colleges in each planning iteration. Consistent with decomposition theory, feedback to the subject in the form of aggregate resource demands (price-direction) or individual bids for higher resource allocations (resource-direction) was given to initiate a new planning iteration. The <b>budgetary</b> <b>goal</b> utilized by subjects was to maximize net dollar contribution from colleges to the university under prespecified quality-of-education constraints. After several planning iterations each subject finalized the resource allocations, terminating the experiment. The hypotheses were that resource-directive subjects would outperform price-directive subjects, that high decision time pressure would exacerbate decision making and that subjects would outperform decomposition algorithms in early iterations. Data from the experiment did not support the first two hypotheses; the third was confirmed. Aside from concluding that strategic factors (organizational design) and tactical factors (time pressure) strongly influence decision making behavior, several specific implications can be tentatively drawn. In similar settings transfer pricing schemes may be preferable to traditional budgeting schemes for planning resource allocations. Furthermore, the potential exists for profitable use of man-machine procedures for resource allocation involving decision support technology in the form of decomposition models to augment human decision heuristics. Finally, experimental methods offer a vehicle for addressing human factors and implementational considerations missing from current analytic models. organization design, goals coordination, resource allocation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the budgeting climate concept and applies {{it to the}} case organizations' budgeting {{in order to understand}} the connections between budgeting activity and human behavior in their organizational and social context. The empirical phase comprised a longitudinal case study covering 13 years undertaken in a profit center's sales organizations in the Finnish parent company of a large international industry group. The concept of the budgeting climate constructed in the theoretical part of this study proved to be relevant to behavioral budgeting research as it enables a study of elements decisive for budgeting practice in combination. Using the budgeting climate concept makes it possible to interpret and understand, at least in part, the reasons for the contradictory results achieved by traditional quantitative behavioral research on budgeting.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} budget related antecedents of job performance of managers. For this purpose, relationships among <b>budgetary</b> participation, budget <b>goal</b> commitment, information sharing, and job performance of managers were examined. The sample consists of managers {{who are responsible}} from the budgets of their units in different private enterprises located in Turkey. Survey data was analyzed with confirmatory factor analyses and Structural Equation Modeling. Results indicate that budgetary participation has statistically significant and positive impact on job performance. It also positively affects budget goal commitment and information sharing. Budget goal commitment and information sharing have significant and positive impact on job performance. In addition, budget goal commitment positively affects information sharing of managers.

40|$|A key {{component}} of CenSSIS research {{is the development of}} new imaging algorithms and the improvement of existing imaging algorithms. Such software is sufficiently complex that structured testing is desirable prior to distribution to the research community at large. A primary goal of this research is to develop a software testing infrastructure to be made available to CenSSIS researchers. Also, while the software testing process accounts for as much as 50 % of the total cost of industrial software development, the most effective methods are almost never used due to <b>budgetary</b> constraints. Another <b>goal</b> of our work is to reduce the costs {{associated with the use of}} effective testing methods by reducing the size of input data sets while not decreasing error detection rates. By applying program analysis techniques not commonly used in software testing, we are able to develop novel input data size reduction heuristics. The use of these heuristics can have a significant economic impact on the overall cost of software development...|$|R
40|$|ManagementAs the Army {{continues}} to face force and budget reductions {{while maintaining a}} high state of readiness, reliance on advanced technology systems is becoming more essential. The Army's leadership has recognized this challenge and is seeking ways to ensure readiness. This thesis explores {{the application of the}} built in test (BIT) maintenance concept in supporting readiness in the Fire Control System (FCS) of the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). It provides background on the current Fire Control System and discusses factors both internal and external to the system that are driving the upgrade. Projected benefits gained from BIT are in terms of readiness through reduction in Mean Time To Repair (MTTR), cost savings, and compression of the maintenance levels. Application of BIT into other systems is covered. BIT is one method currently being developed to maintain and improve readiness despite continued force and <b>budgetary</b> reductions. The <b>goal</b> of this thesis is to show how technology can be used to support readiness by increasing efficiency while minimizing costs. NAU. S. Army (USA) autho...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{existence}} of optimism {{as a personal}} psychological characteristic of managers is a necessity in contemporary economy and decision making, although the phenomenon of over-optimism may lead to unfavourable outcomes. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the optimism bias and its impact on the firms' future performance. Especially regarding the recent years where Greece faces increased economic depression, high percentages of unemployment and lack of <b>budgetary</b> discipline, the <b>goal</b> is therefore, to find whether managerial optimism has an impact on corporate investment of Greek firms. Design/methodology/approach-The investment of firms with optimistic managers is more sensitive to cash flow than the investment of firms with managers who are not optimistic. To test the research question a number of fixed effect panel regressions of capital expenditures (capital expenditures divided by lagged assets is the dependent variable) is run. In all regressions we analyse cash flow divided by lagged assets and lagged Tobin's Q as the independent variables, for firms whose managers are classified as optimistic and not optimistic. This classification is based on the optimism "dummy" variable, which is equal to 1 when members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board (ALL), only the Executive Board (EB), and only CEO are classified as optimistic. The concept of this study is tested for firms which are listed in the Athens Stock Exchange. A total of 243 firms are recorded, for the time period between 2007 and 2012, including firms from 11 different industries; basic materials, chemicals, consumer goods, consumer services, health care, industrials, financials, oil and gas, technology, telecommunications, and utilities. Based on the literature and on related methodology aspects, financial firms are excluded. Findings-It was revealed that managerial optimism affects corporate investment in firms with high degree of closely held shares. Moreover, managerial optimism is never linked to corporate investment regarding firms which belong to middle degree of closely held shares. Additionally it is proved that decisions for acquisitions are not affected by the manager's optimism regarding the prospects of his / her firm. This result it is not consistent with results of previous literature like Malmendier and Tate (2008) and Glaser et al. (2008) who have been found that cash flow, Tobin's Q and firm size mainly drive the probability of an acquisition. Finally, it is confirmed that investment of firms with optimistic managers was found to be more sensitive to cash flow than the investment of firms with managers who are not optimistic. Optimism was proved to be extremely effective concerning investment. Research limitations/implications-A possible proposal for further research could be the testing of each year separately. In this study we have run the regressions for the whole of the 6 -year period of 2007 to 2012. However, testing each year individually could provide researchers with the ability to compare different results, to find out whether there was anything special statistically for each specific year and maybe test the period after the year 2010 when the Greek crisis had started to come up on the horizon. The impact of the Greek financial crisis on managerial behaviour and on the personal characteristics of managers like optimism could constitute a field for further research. Originality/value-Since research on this specific field of finance is quite limited; this study aims to add value on the existing knowledge on the Greek case. The investigation of managerial optimism as a personal, psychological and mental characteristic encloses the effort of Greek managers to come out of the economic crisis and consequently achieve greater outcomes for their firms...|$|R
