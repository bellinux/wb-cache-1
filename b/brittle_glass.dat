40|$|Significant {{progress}} {{in understanding the}} mechanical behavior of metallic glasses (MGs) was made over the past decade, particularly on mechanisms of plastic deformation. However, recent research thrust has been on exploring the mechanics and physics of fracture. MGs can be very brittle with K-Ic values similar to silicate glasses and ceramics or very tough with K-Ic akin to high toughness crystalline metals. Even the tough MGs can become brittle with structural relaxation following annealing at temperatures close to glass transition temperature (T-g). Detailed experimental studies coupled with complementary numerical simulations of the recent past have provided insights on the micromechanisms of failure as well as nature of crack tip fields, and established the governing fracture criteria for ductile and <b>brittle</b> <b>glasses.</b> In this paper, the above advances are reviewed and outstanding issues {{in the context of}} fracture of amorphous alloys that need to be resolved are identified...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The erosion {{process in}} micro-machining of <b>brittle</b> <b>glasses</b> using a low {{pressure}} slurry jet is discussed. The process {{capability of the}} technique is assessed by examining the machined surface integrity in relation to fluid flow dynamics in micro-hole generations. The holes produced are characterised by a “W ” shape in the cross section, while the surface morphology is distinguished by three zones associated with the fluid flow behaviour, i. e. a direct impact zone, a wavy zone and an accumulation zone. The surfaces appear to be smooth and without cracks, indicating a predominance of the ductile mode erosion process. With the increase of pressure, the erosion rates can be enhanced {{as a result of}} the expending of the accumulation zone while the outer diameter of the holes remains unchanged. This study shows that this technique can be used for micro-machining with high surface quality, and provides an essential understanding for further research in the avenue...|$|R

50|$|A {{different}} {{philosophy is}} used in composite materials, where <b>brittle</b> <b>glass</b> fibres, for example, are embedded in a ductile matrix such as polyester resin.

40|$|We study Mode I crack {{propagation}} in amorphous material via a {{molecular dynamics simulation}} of a binary alloy with pairwise central-force interactions. We find that when the system is subjected to constant displacement after introduction of a seed crack, the crack does not propagate. This {{was found to be}} true both for the modified Lennard-Jones potential of Falk and a shorter-range potential of our own devising. Crystalline samples prepared with these potentials exhibit normal brittle fracture, with running cracks. Only when subjected to a constantly increasing strain did the crack in the glasses lengthen. Even here, once the strain stopped increasing, the crack tip stopped moving. We examined the stress-strain curve for our model materials, and found that they did not exhibit the saturated stress plateau characteristic of ductile materials. We attribute the failure of {{crack propagation}} in this system to the availability of many meta-stable configurations available to the crack tip which serve to soak up the energy which would otherwise drive the crack. We conclude that this class of models is inadequate to describe crack propagation in <b>brittle</b> <b>glasses...</b>|$|R

In this study the mechanical properties of reactive air brazed YSZ-steel joints and their long-term stability at high temperatures in air and dual atmospheres are investigated. Silver-based braze compositions like Ag- 4 CuO are used for reactive air brazing of gas tightness samples. During aging in air at 850 °C for 800 h {{the thickness of the}} interfacial oxide layers increases with time, while the bending strength decreases. Microstructural analysis reveals the formation of voids within the brazing zone and the development of multilayered reactionlayers.

However, the addition of small amounts of TiH 2 to the brazecompositions enhances the dual atmosphere tolerance of the reactive air brazed seals...|$|R

5000|$|An {{electrical}} insulator serves to provide physical separation of conducting parts, and under normal operating conditions is continuously {{subject to a}} high electric field which occupies the air surrounding the equipment. Overvoltage events may cause the electric field to exceed the dielectric strength of air and result {{in the formation of}} an arc between the conducting parts and over the surface of the insulator. [...] This is called flashover. Contamination of the surface of the insulator reduces the breakdown strength and increases the tendency to flash over. On an electrical transmission system, protective relays are expected to detect the formation of the arc and automatically open circuit breakers to discharge the circuit and extinguish the arc. Under a worst case, this process may take as long as several seconds, during which time the insulator surface would be in close contact with the highly energetic plasma of the arc. This is very damaging to an insulator, and may shatter <b>brittle</b> <b>glass</b> or ceramic disks, resulting in its complete failure.|$|E

In this study the mechanical properties and the long-term stability of ceramic-metal joints prepared by induction heating are investigated. Fracture experiments are carried out to characterize the bending strength and failure mechanisms of silver-based reactive air brazes. Due to thinner interfacial layers the induction brazed 4 -point bending specimens showed higher strength than samples brazed in conventional furnaces. Characterization of fracture surfaces wi th SEM reveals details of fracture origin and crack propagation. The cracks in the interfacial layers between braze/ceramic and braze/metal are identified as failure reason for tested samples. It is shown that during annealing in air at 850 °C the 4 -point bending strength decreases with time while the thickness of the oxide reaction layers increases. Failure mechanisms and possibilities for improvements of the reactive air brazing technology are discussed...|$|R

Furthermore, the ceramic exhibits some inelasticity in the stress-strain behaviour in the presence of lateral confinement...|$|E

Then the numerical results correspond closely to those obtained by experiments, and the fracturing damage mode shows that the sample under high strain rate loading would crack along vertical diameter in the band region between two loading edges, which differs from the static damage mode. Furthermore, by comparing a group of contrast numerical tests, the numerical results prove that loading area upon the top side of samples would influence the fracture mode of dynamic split experiments, which indicates that the narrow loading plane is better...|$|E

This mechanism involves little dissipation and also explains the formation of nanocorrugations...|$|R
40|$|Owing {{to a lack}} of microstructure, glassy {{materials}} are inherently strong but brittle, and often demonstrate extreme sensitivity to flaws. Accordingly, their macroscopic failure is often not initiated by plastic yielding, and almost always terminated by brittle fracture. Unlike conventional <b>brittle</b> <b>glasses,</b> metallic glasses are generally capable of limited plastic yielding by shear-band sliding {{in the presence of a}} flaw, and thus exhibit toughness–strength relationships that lie between those of brittle ceramics and marginally tough metals. Here, a bulk glassy palladium alloy is introduced, demonstrating an unusual capacity for shielding an opening crack accommodated by an extensive shear-band sliding process, which promotes a fracture toughness comparable to those of the toughest materials known. This result demonstrates that the combination of toughness and strength (that is, damage tolerance) accessible to amorphous materials extends beyond the benchmark ranges established by the toughest and strongest materials known, thereby pushing the envelope of damage tolerance accessible to a structural metal. Crystalline materials exhibit ordered structures with morphological features (for example, grains) that usually extend to the microscopic level. The defects associated with these microstructural features (for example, dislocations) become mobile under stress, enabling extensive plastic shielding ahead of an opening crack, which promotes high fracture toughness...|$|R
