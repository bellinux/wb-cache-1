50|$|After the InterCity 250 {{project was}} scrapped, Virgin Trains, who have {{operated}} the InterCity West Coast franchise since the privatisation of British Rail, commissioned new rolling {{stock in the}} form of Class 390 electric multiple units, rather than the Class 93 locomotive and separate Mark 5 carriages proposed by British Rail. Network Rail track design standards previously used the Mark 5 coach to represent coaching stock with 19m <b>bogie</b> <b>centres,</b> however from June 2016 references to this requirement will be removed.

25|$|Locomotives {{with total}} adhesion, {{where all of}} the wheels are coupled together, {{generally}} lack stability at speed. To counter this, locomotives often fit unpowered carrying wheels mounted on two-wheeled trucks or four-wheeled <b>bogies</b> <b>centred</b> by springs that help to guide the locomotive through curves. These usually take on weight – of the cylinders at the front or the firebox at the rear — when the width exceeds that of the mainframes. For multiple coupled-wheels on a rigid chassis, a variety of systems for controlled side-play exist.|$|R

50|$|State Cars 2 and 3 {{were built}} in 1901 at Newport Workshops, and entered service on 30 April that year. The two cars were largely based on the {{existing}} V type carriage design, with a 50 ft body and 35 ft <b>bogie</b> <b>centres.</b> The main difference was the roof style, which was clerestory but with curved ends as would {{be applied to the}} later E type carriages. While under construction, official correspondence referred to the two vehicles as Royal carriages. After entry to service, State Car No.2 was named Alexandra and Stare Car No.3 was named Edward. The names appear on the carriage drawings centred above the windowline, but no photos exist of the cars to indicate whether they were applied.|$|R
50|$|As on the Class 7E, the locomotive's {{pantograph}} {{contact shoe}} centres are directly above the <b>bogie</b> pivot <b>centres</b> {{to reduce the}} possibility of pantograph hookups on catenary in sharp curves, such as in turnouts, {{as a result of}} sideways movement of the pantograph in relation to the overhead wire.|$|R

5000|$|The {{intention}} of InterCity 250 {{was to build}} 30 full trains, each consisting of a Class 93 locomotive, nine 26 m long Mark 5 passenger coaches and a Mark 5 Driving Van Trailer. The coaches {{would be capable of}} 155 mph (250 km/h) and were specified to be equivalent in weight to the shorter Mark 4 coaches, which were felt to be overweight. The decision to increase the length of the coaches to 26 m from the 23 m of the Mark 4 was dictated by reduced maintenance costs following British Rail studies which indicated that such a length was feasible within the UK loading gauge. Indeed, during 1987 British Rail had considered increasing the length of the Mark 4 to 25.5 m (with 18.13m <b>bogie</b> <b>centres)</b> but the in-service date of 1989 and complexity of changing the design to suit caused the variation order to be shelved.|$|R

40|$|Track {{buckling}} {{has been}} considered as a major concern for Continuous Welded Rail (CWR) since the introduction of CWR on railway networks. Both static and dynamic loadings on track can cause track buckling. Track can be subjected to static loads such as tensile and compressive loads due to temperature differential, and misalignment due to maintenance operations and cumulative deflections. Dynamic parameters include vehicle loading on track under differenct speeds, Net Axle Lateral to Vertical (L/V) force ratio and <b>bogie</b> <b>centre</b> spacing. A number of research studies {{have been carried out}} to investigate the effect of different parameters of track buckling to establish a safety operating criteria. Railways around the world follow their own specific standards to safeguard against track buckling. However, all the studies differ in environment and operational characteristics. Hence unification of knowledge concerning different track buckling parameters is important. In the present study a comparative analysis of different parameters of track buckling is presented...|$|R

50|$|The bogie {{suspension}} system consisted of coil primary suspension, and flexicoil secondary suspension with anti-hunting and anti-rocking dampers. Tractive forces from bogie to locomotive were transferred via traction rods {{connected to a}} low lying connection at the <b>bogie</b> pivot <b>centre.</b> Mechanical braking was by wheel mounted disc brakes. Electric braking is either up to 4.5MW rheostatic braking via roof mounted resistors, or up to 7.2MW regenerative braking.|$|R

40|$|Centre bearing {{forces and}} wear losses in three piece bogies have been {{simulated}} using VAMPIRE®. Bogie rotational resistance has been modelled at centre bearings and constant contact side bearers accounting for uneven loading during track transitions. The detailed model handles cylindrical centre bearings accounting for rim wall contact {{as well as}} the <b>centre</b> <b>plate</b> planar friction connections and uneven loading. The simulations have been performed for a range of curve radii assuming gauge face lubricated track. Wagons of moderate or high friction resistance to <b>bogie</b> rotation at <b>centre</b> bearings and side bearers have shown altered wheel wear, reducing maintenance cycle times in operations for rollingstock. In this paper, simulation studies have examined the effects of cant deficiency / excess and transition curvature on the wear performance of wagons and individual wheelsets, in particular the high wearing leading wheelsets. Wheel wear is shown to be altered due to changes in bogie rotation friction moments retained through the curve when cant deficiency of the curve is altered. The simulation results also show that transition curvature design can be used to reduce high wheel/rail wear in 3 piece bogies generated by high bogie rotation resistance. In the same way, transition curvature design can be used to alter the wheelset angle of attack during constant curving on 3 piece bogies...|$|R

50|$|Like the {{subsequent}} Classes 2E, 3E and 4E, the Class 1E had bogie mounted draft gear.

The <b>bogie</b> pivot <b>centres</b> were 6604 mm apart. One of the bottom pivot centres was fixed while the other was free to move longitudinally to allow for any wear occurring in the articulated coupling between the two bogies.|$|R
50|$|The {{rationale}} behind the design was that, if the tender frame could {{be carried on}} more points, represented by the rigidly mounted and Bissel wheels, instead of on only two <b>bogie</b> pivot <b>centres,</b> the frame could be made lighter.

50|$|In 1976, Verkehrsbetriebe Zürich (VBZ) took {{delivery}} {{of their first}} batch of 60 Tram 2000 vehicles, for use on the Zürich tram system. These metre gauge articulated bogie trams have two body sections supported on three <b>bogies.</b> The <b>centre</b> <b>bogie</b> supports the articulation and only the outer bogies are powered, an arrangement that is designated Be 4/6 in Switzerland. As VBZ's network has turning loops at all termini, the cars are single-ended (have a driver's cab at only one end) and single-sided (have doors on only one side). The car bodies were built by SWS, the bogies by SIG and the electrical equipment by BBC. Of the cars, 45 are of standard configuration whereas 15 have no driving cabs and are so suitable only {{for use as a}} second unit in a coupled pair. The name Tram 2000 derives from the numbering series applied to these trams, but also reflects the fleet modernisation their introduction heralded.|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. The {{performance}} {{and reliability of}} induced draft fans are of ever growing concarn in industry, especially in the power generation industry. The reliability and plant efficiency depend on the design conditions of all plant components. Induced draft fans handle high temperature flyash-laden flue gas, and are often plagued by mass-flow deficiencies and excessive vibration in fossil fuel powerplants [1]. In this research an existing induced-draft fan is analysed to investigate the occurrence of high stresses forming on the impeller, as these stresses lead to cracks appearing on the <b>centre</b> <b>plate</b> of the impeller. The basic approach used {{to address this problem}} is implementing the Finite Element Method starting with different cantilever beam configurations to simulate the connection of the blade with the <b>centre</b> <b>plate.</b> Geometries are kept constant to facilitate in the practical set-up implementation stage of the dissertation. The practical set-up is used to verify the results obtained from the Finite Element Method program, and it serves as a benchmark test for evaluating the further use of the chosen Finite Element Method program. A simplified Finite Element Method model is presented for the induced draft fan. Static and frequency analyses are done to determine the characteristics of the fan structure. Lastly an advanced dynamic analysis is done on the specific fan. Different ramp force functions are used to simulate different start-up curves for the fan. A conclusion will be drawn from the dissertation, and recommendations will be made for similar future research work...|$|R
