40|$|Restricted Access. Two new {{homologous}} series of isomeric achiral five-ring bent-core compounds containing 3, 4 -disubstituted biphenyl moiety have been synthesised and the mesophases that they exhibit characterised. Compounds of series A are obtained from 4 -hydroxybiphenyl- 3 -carboxylic acid while those in series B are prepared <b>by</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> of <b>the</b> hydroxyl and carboxylic groups. This change {{seems to have}} a profound effect on the mesophase properties. Interestingly, for compounds of series A containing the long terminal chain, a transition between two polar orthogonal smectic phases has been observed. The observed mesophases have been characterised using a combination of polarised light optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction studies and electro-optical measurements. This is the first example of a transition between two partial bilayer polar orthogonal smectic phases. In addition, the effect of a fluoro substituent ortho to the strongly polar terminal cyano group on the mesophase has also been examined...|$|R

40|$|The {{proposed}} project {{shows the}} results obtained in the implementation and testing in lacustrine and marine environment of an innovative laterals hydro floating tilting systems control for USV or remote/autonomous surface nautical vehicles. This vehicle {{is based on a}} pending patent belonging to Palermo University (Patent Pending RM 2012 A 000209 and RM 2012 A 000209). The system allows, during operation as a vehicle USV, set changes sailing trim and make turns with very narrow angle with little shunting movements. In fact the main benefits obtained were able to change or adjust the navigation structure by changing the tilt of one or two hydro floating during navigation without intervening directly on the flaps of the vehicle. Another benefit obtained <b>by</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> of <b>the</b> two hydro floating {{is to be able to}} make the tight turn in very little room to maneuver and with little propulsion. The system allows, during operation as a vehicle USV, set changes sailing trim and make turns with very narrow angle with little shunting movements. The tilting system control allows a benefit of fuel or energy for electric vehicles and on the reduced space for maneuvering. The experimental tests were carried out on an telecontrolled electric power vehicle coupled with a jet propulsion, (USV) where the sensor telemetry on-line has allowed us to verify the effectiveness of the complete system, just during the performance of trim and maneuver of the vehicle. Then, the proposed system can be used for applications in all the fields of the nautical vehicle. The procedures applied in the present article, as well as the main equations used, are the result of previous applications made in different technical fields that show a good replicability (1 - 4, 14, 18 - 20) ...|$|R

RESUMO: Após 30 anos de incômoda convivência com a estrada estadual, antes conhecida comoOP– 2, posteriormente PA– 253 e hoje BR– 153, aberta pelo exército brasileiro à época daGuerrilha do Araguaia, os Suruí Aikewára conseguiram com auxílio da Procuradoria daRepública estabelecer, mediante laudo antropológico e estudos de impacto ambiental, “acordo”com o Governo do Estado do Pará para mitigar o impacto da rodovia. Entretanto, as cláusulas danegociação não vêm sendo cumpridas, fato que gera descontentamento entre os índios. Os Suruí,premidos pelos problemas causados pela rodovia, não possuem outro recurso que “entupedinir”(obstruir) a rodovia, vez por outra, para chamar atenção das autoridades. À última manifestaçãode descontentamento em março de 2003, provocada pela descoberta de mais um cadáver“despejado” em suas terras, o caminhoneiro de nome Divino Eterno ultrapassou os obstáculos eatirou o veículo sobre os jovens Suruí que guarneciam a obstrução da rodovia. Na defesa de seuterritório e na ausência de autoridades constituídas, os guerreiros retiveram o veículo, o motoristae a mulher que o acompanhava. Depois de algum tempo, a “liberação” dos retidos e do veículopelos representantes do órgão tutelar, à revelia dos Suruí, possibilitou que, liberado, DivinoEterno oferecesse queixa, na delegacia de São Geraldo do Araguaia, contra três Suruí Aikewára.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{synthesized}} two {{series of}} compounds {{in which a}} nitroxide radical and a fullerene C 60 moiety were kept separated by a 310 -helical peptide bridge containing two intramolecular CO···H−N hydrogen bonds. The direction of the resulting molecular dipole moment could be <b>reversed</b> <b>by</b> switching <b>the</b> <b>position</b> of fullerene and nitroxide {{with respect to the}} peptide nitrogen and carbon termini. The resulting fullerene−peptide−radical systems were compared to the behaviors of otherwise identical peptides but lacking either C 60 or the free radical moiety. Electrochemical analysis and chemical nitroxide reduction experiments show that the dipole moment of the helix significantly affects the redox properties of both electroactive groups. Besides providing evidence of a folded helical conformation for the peptide bridge, IR and NMR results highlight a strong effect of peptide orientation on the spectral patterns, pointing to a specific interaction of one of the helical orientations with the C 60 moiety. Time-resolved EPR spectra show not only that for both systems triplet quenching by nitroxide induces spin polarization of the radical spin sublevels, but also that the coupling interaction can be either weak or stron...|$|R

40|$|Laparoscopic liver surgery {{has evolved}} over the last 2 decades. Advancements in {{surgical}} technology, surgical technique, and postoperative care have aided in lifting barriers to laparoscopic liver resections (LLR). LLR might decrease morbidity and hospitalisation stay compared to open approach, and importantly in liver surgery, may decrease postoperative costal pain. However, in hepatic surgery as in all abdominal procedures, laparoscopic approach is a mean but not a goal. The possibility of LLR should neither modify indications for surgery nor the type of resection. Physiologic modifications induced by CO 2 pneumoperitoneum should be known by the surgical and anaesthetic team involved in LLR. Pneumoperitoneum decreases cardiac output, and this decrease could be worsened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>reverse</b> Trendelenburg <b>position</b> and <b>by</b> hepatic hilar clamping. CO 2 pneumoperitoneum decreases hepatic blood flow. This is a clear advantage for limiting blood loss during LLR, but this also might increase liver ischemia during Pringle liver hilum clamping, a manoeuvre that should be avoided in LLR. Low venous pressure might decrease blood loss by the small supra hepatic veins, but may also further decrease cardiac output. Several devices {{may be used for}} liver section, without evidence of the superiority of one device compared to others. Endo GIA might be very helpful to control the major liver vessels, as branches of portal vein or suprahepatic veins. Significant CO 2 embolism is a rare complication, and conversion to open approach for haemorrhage should be performed only if blood loss is controlled. Up to now, there is no clear scientific evidence that laparoscopic approach provides any advantage compared to open approach. SILS, LESS or even robotic approaches should only considered as purely experimental. Current barriers to LLR will continue to fall in the future. Peer reviewe...|$|R
