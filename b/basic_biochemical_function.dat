40|$|A major {{objective}} in protein science is {{the design of}} enzymes with novel catalytic activities that are tailored to specific applications. Such enzymes may have great potential in biocatalysis and biosensor technology, such as in degradation of pollutants and biomass, and in drug and food processing. To reach this objective, investigations into the <b>basic</b> <b>biochemical</b> <b>functioning</b> of metalloproteins are still required. In this perspective, metalloprotein design provides a powerful approach first {{to contribute to a}} more comprehensive understanding of the way metalloproteins function in biology, with the ultimate goal of developing novel biocatalysts and sensing devices. Metalloprotein mimetics have been developed through the introduction of novel metal-binding sites into naturally occurring proteins as well as through de novo protein design. We have approached the challenge of reproducing metalloprotein active sites by using a miniaturization process. We centered our attention on iron-containing proteins, and we developed models for heme proteins and diironeoxo proteins. In this paper we summarize the results we obtained on the design, structural, and functional properties of DFs, a family of artificial diiron proteins...|$|R

40|$|Native {{proteins}} {{perform an}} amazing variety of <b>biochemical</b> <b>functions,</b> including enzymatic catalysis, and {{can engage in}} protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that are essential for life. A key question is how special are these functional properties of proteins. Are they extremely rare, or are they an intrinsic feature? Comparison to the properties of compact conformations of artificially generated compact protein structures selected for thermodynamic stability but not any type of function, the artificial (ART) protein library, demonstrates that a remarkable number of the properties of native-like proteins are recapitulated. These include the complete set of small molecule ligand-binding pockets and most protein-protein interfaces. ART structures are predicted {{to be capable of}} weakly binding metabolites and cover a significant fraction of metabolic pathways, with the most enriched pathways including ancient ones such as glycolysis. Native-like active sites are also found in ART proteins. A small fraction of ART proteins are predicted to have strong protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Overall, it appears that <b>biochemical</b> <b>function</b> is an intrinsic feature of proteins which nature has significantly optimized during evolution. These studies raise questions as to the relative roles of specificity and promiscuity in the <b>biochemical</b> <b>function</b> and control of cells that need investigation...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{data set}} of aligned protein domain superfamilies of known {{three-dimensional}} structure, {{we compared the}} location of interdomain interfaces on the tertiary folds between members of distantly related protein domain superfamilies. The data set analyzed is comprised of interdomain interfaces, with domains occurring within a polypeptide chain and those between two polypeptide chains. We observe that, in general, the interfaces between protein domains are formed entirely in different locations on the tertiary folds in such pairs. This variation in the location of interface happens in protein domains involved {{in a wide range}} of functions, such as enzymes, adapters, and domains that bind protein ligands, or cofactors. While <b>basic</b> <b>biochemical</b> functionality is preserved at the domain superfamily level, the effect of <b>biochemical</b> <b>function</b> on protein assemblies is different in these protein domains related by superfamily. The divergence between proteins, in most cases, is coupled with domain recruitment, with different modes of interaction with the recruited domain. This is in complete contrast to the observation that in closely related homologous protein domains, almost always the interaction interfaces are topologically equivalent. In a small subset of interacting domains within proteins related by remote homology, we observe that the relative positioning of domains with respect to one another is preserved. Based on the analysis of multidomain proteins of known or unknown structure, we suggest that variation in protein-protein interactions in members within a superfamily could serve as diverging points in otherwise parallel metabolic or signaling pathways. We discuss a few representative cases of diverging pathways involving domains in a superfamily...|$|R

40|$|Conidiation is {{a common}} and {{critical}} asexual reproductive mode in fungi. The ascomycetes, the largest group in the kingdom Fungi undergo conidiation. The wide array of morphological difference in a conidiophore and conidial size, shape, and cellular organization demonstrates the importance of evolution in driving the morphological and functional diversity. An important unanswered question is how these conidiation processes evolve. We hypothesized that a conidiation regulatory pathway was present in the ancestral species, and became specialized in the extant species to lead to morphological and functional diversity. To address this hypothesis we assessed the conserved function of conidiation regulators in two distantly related ascomycetes, Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa. Using sequence similarity analysis, N. crassa orthologs were characterized to seven main conidiation regulatory genes in A. nidulans (fluG, flbC, flbD, abaA, wetA, medA, and stuA). Expression of the N. crassa orthologs complemented defective conidiation in the A. nidulans fluG, flbD, wetA, medA, and stuA mutants. In contrast, abaA and flbC and the N. crassa orthologs did not share conserved <b>biochemical</b> <b>function.</b> Taken in context of other recent studies of conidiation regulators, there are four distinct evolutionary patterns: (i) Non-homologous genes with analogous roles in conidiation (?brlA? and ?fl?), (ii) Orthologs with retained <b>biochemical</b> <b>function</b> that lack analogous role in conidiation (?fluG?, ?flbD?, and ?wetA?), (iii) Orthologs with retained <b>biochemical</b> <b>function</b> and analogous roles in conidiation (?medA? and ?stuA?), and (iv) Orthologs with <b>biochemical</b> <b>function</b> not conserved but with analogous roles in conidiation (?abaA? and ?flbC?).
