Along the descent the highway passes by <b>Bodie,</b> {{a ghost town}} which the state park system has preserved, {{including}} items still on the shelves in the abandoned stores.|$|E
5|$|Basement rock {{under the}} Mono–Inyo chain {{consists}} of the same granitic and metamorphic rock {{that make up the}} Sierra Nevada. Above that layer are basaltic grading to rhyolitic volcanic rocks that are 3.5 million to less than 760,000 years old. Volcanism occurred north of the chain, in the <b>Bodie</b> Hills, as far back as 28 million years. Nearly all the rock east of the Sierra Nevada in the Mono Basin area is volcanic in origin.|$|E
5|$|Gold rush–related boomtowns {{sprang up}} near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, <b>Bodie</b> (north of Mono Lake), {{was founded in}} the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, {{immediately}} northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees {{felt that}} Vick had not {{lived up to}} his {{potential}} during his four seasons with the team. Considering the team now had a solid outfield of Ruth, Meusel, Lewis, and <b>Bodie,</b> and the Yankees needed pitching; Vick became expendable. On December15, 1920, the Yankees traded Vick, Muddy Ruel, Del Pratt and Hank Thormahlen to the Red Sox for Waite Hoyt, Harry Harper, Wally Schang and Mike McNally.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of the {{investigation}} was Avon Barksdale's drug empire. The driven, ruthless Barksdale (Wood Harris) was aided by business-minded Stringer Bell (Idris Elba). Avon's nephew D'Angelo Barksdale (Larry Gilliard Jr.) ran some of his uncle's territory, but also possessed a guilty conscience, while loyal Wee-Bey Brice (Hassan Johnson) was responsible for multiple homicides carried out on Avon's orders. Working under D'Angelo were Poot (Tray Chaney), <b>Bodie</b> (J. D. Williams), and Wallace (Michael B. Jordan), all street-level drug dealers. Wallace was an intelligent but naive youth trapped in the drug trade, and Poot a randy young man happy to follow rather than lead. Omar Little (Michael K. Williams), a renowned Baltimore stick-up man robbing drug dealers for a living, was a frequent thorn in the side of the Barksdale clan.|$|E
5|$|Freamon {{discovers the}} bodies Chris and Snoop had hidden. <b>Bodie</b> offers McNulty {{testimony}} against Marlo and his crew, but is shot dead on his corner by O-Dog, {{a member of}} Marlo's crew. Sherrod dies after snorting a poisoned vial of heroin that, unbeknownst to him, Bubbles had prepared for their tormentor. Bubbles turns himself in {{to the police and}} tries to hang himself, but he survives and is taken to a detox facility. Michael has now joined the ranks of Marlo's killers and runs one of his corners, with Dukie leaving high school to work there. Randy's house is firebombed by school bullies for his cooperation with the police, leaving his caring foster mother hospitalized and sending him back to a group home. Namond is taken in by Colvin, who recognized the good in him. The major crimes unit from earlier seasons is largely reunited, and they resume their investigation of Marlo Stanfield.|$|E

[...] He began working with the Barksdales at age 13. His older brother James was also a gangster, but was killed early in <b>Bodie's</b> life, depriving him of immediate familial support.|$|R

5|$|Paul {{returns to}} Erinsborough and sets {{fire to the}} Lassiter's complex. He also kills Gus Cleary (Ben Barrack), when Gus catches him. Paul helps rebuild the complex and reclaims Lassiter's for himself. Paul has affairs with both Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) and Liljana Bishop (Marcella Russo). He later frames Liljana's husband, David (Kevin Harrington) for fraud. Paul strikes a deal with Affirmacon to build on Ramsay Street and he gets his protégé Dylan Timmins (Damien <b>Bodie)</b> to pollute the local wetlands. When Paul wants {{to pull out of}} the deal, he is taken to the bush and beaten up. Paul escapes and falls down a cliff, badly {{breaking}} his leg. While Paul recovers in hospital, his leg becomes infected and is amputated. Paul's sister, Lucy, encourages him to make a proper home for himself in Erinsborough and he moves into Number 22. Paul begins a relationship with Izzy and his estranged daughter Elle moves in. To celebrate the Lassiter's Hotel 20th anniversary, Paul and several of his neighbours go on a joy flight to Tasmania. During the flight, a bomb explodes causing the plane to crash into the sea. Paul, Izzy and Elle survive.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth season}} {{concentrates}} on the school system and the mayoral race. It takes {{a closer look at}} Marlo Stanfield's drug gang which has grown to control most of western Baltimore's trafficking and Dukie, Randy, Michael, and Namondfour boys from West Baltimoreas they enter the eighth grade. Prez has begun a new career as a mathematics teacher at the same school. The cold-blooded Marlo has come to dominate the streets of the west side, using murder and intimidation to make up for his weak-quality drugs and lack of business acumen. His enforcers Chris Partlow and Snoop conceal their numerous victims in abandoned and boarded-up row houses where the bodies will not be readily discovered. The disappearances of so many known criminals come to mystify both the major crimes unit investigating Marlo and the homicide unit assigned to solve the presumed murders. Marlo coerces <b>Bodie</b> into working under him.|$|E
5|$|The {{region has}} been used by humans for centuries. Obsidian was {{collected}} by Mono Paiutes for making sharp tools and arrow points. Glassy rock continues to be removed in modern times for use as commercial scour and yard decoration. Mono Mills processed timber felled on or near the volcanoes for the nearby boomtown <b>Bodie</b> in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Water diversions into the Los Angeles Aqueduct system from their natural outlets in Mono Lake started in 1941 after a water tunnel was cut under the Mono Craters. Mono Lake Volcanic Field and {{a large part of the}} Mono Craters gained some protection under Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984. Resource use along all of the chain is managed by the United States Forest Service as part of Inyo National Forest. Various activities are possible along the chain, including hiking, bird watching, canoeing, skiing, and mountain biking.|$|E
50|$|Her {{career was}} one of the {{shortest}} in the Navy. Clearing New York City 14 August 1863 under the command of Acting Ensign J. L. Winton, Crocus ran aground on <b>Bodie's</b> Island, North Carolina, 17 August and was totally wrecked.|$|R
25|$|Frederick, E. Bunker, master, {{returned}} to Port Jackson on 20 August 1811 from the fishery, with 55 tons of sperm oil for the London market. She {{left for the}} fishery again on 9 October, in ballast and again under Alexander <b>Bodie's</b> command.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bodie's</b> {{books include}} Foundations of Pension Finance, Pensions in the U.S. Economy, Issues in Pension Economics, and Financial Aspects of the U.S. Pension System. His textbook, Investments, is the market leader {{and is used}} in the {{certification}} programs of the CFA Institute and the Society of Actuaries. His textbook Financial Economics is coauthored by Robert C. Merton.|$|R
25|$|Also {{registered}} as a California Historical Landmark, the ghost town officially was established as <b>Bodie</b> State Historic Park in 1962. It receives about 200,000 visitors yearly. Since 2012, <b>Bodie</b> has been {{administered by the}} <b>Bodie</b> Foundation, which uses the tagline Protecting Bodie's Future by Preserving Its Past.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bodie</b> boomed {{from late}} 1877 through {{mid to late}} 1880. The first newspaper, The Standard Pioneer Journal of Mono County, {{published}} its first edition on October 10, 1877. Starting as a weekly, it soon expanded publication to thrice-weekly. It was also during this time that a telegraph line was built which connected <b>Bodie</b> with Bridgeport and Genoa, Nevada. California and Nevada newspapers predicted <b>Bodie</b> would become the next Comstock Lode. Men from both states were lured to <b>Bodie</b> {{by the prospect of}} another bonanza.|$|E
25|$|Gold {{discovered}} at <b>Bodie</b> {{coincided with the}} discovery of silver at nearby Aurora (thought to be in California, later found to be Nevada), and the distant Comstock Lode beneath Virginia City, Nevada. But while these two towns boomed, interest in <b>Bodie</b> remained lackluster. By 1868 only two companies had built stamp mills at <b>Bodie,</b> and both had failed.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the season Poot is {{released}} from prison after serving fifteen months of a four-year prison sentence and immediately goes back to work with <b>Bodie's</b> crew. He is unhappy to learn that they are now working under Avon's old rival Marlo Stanfield, but does not seem to mind the change too much.|$|R
50|$|Stringer assumes {{command of}} the Barksdale crew when Avon is arrested {{at the end of}} season one. D'Angelo is also arrested and when he learns of the murder of his friend Wallace he blames Stringer, driving a wedge between the two. Stringer rewards <b>Bodie's</b> loyalty by {{promoting}} him to run their operation at the 221 tower.|$|R
50|$|Marlo begins season four {{in control}} of all the best {{territory}} in Western Baltimore. He ruthlessly protects his territory through Chris and Snoop, who kill off targets on his orders and hide the bodies in vacant buildings. When one of Marlo's crew chiefs, Fruit, is killed by a dealer from <b>Bodie's</b> gang, Marlo is quick to order the death of Lex, the dealer responsible.|$|R
25|$|Poot Carr and <b>Bodie</b> Broadus {{visit the}} site {{where one of the}} bodies was found. They have heard that Little Kevin's body was found inside. <b>Bodie</b> becomes {{increasingly}} agitated about the unjustifiable nature of the killing of his friend. Officer Jimmy McNulty recognizes <b>Bodie</b> when he vandalizes a patrol car as he is being arrested by other officers.|$|E
25|$|McNulty {{waits for}} <b>Bodie</b> {{as he is}} {{released}} from jail and offers to buy him lunch. As they leave, Monk arrives with the bondsman and notices <b>Bodie</b> getting into McNulty's car. McNulty takes <b>Bodie</b> to Cylburn Arboretum. <b>Bodie</b> tells him {{that he is not}} an informant but admits his frustration with his life as a drug dealer and Marlo's leadership. He states that Marlo expects his people to stand behind him, yet he himself does not stand behind people who work for him. He tells McNulty that the game is rigged and that he feels like a pawn on a chessboard, showing that some of D'Angelo Barksdale's teachings were not lost on him. He offers McNulty information to bring down Marlo, but openly tells McNulty that he will not give any information on any former Barksdale associate. McNulty, out of genuine respect, tells <b>Bodie</b> that he is a soldier.|$|E
25|$|The {{town was}} {{designated}} a National Historic Landmark in 1961, and in 1962 {{the state legislature}} authorized creation of <b>Bodie</b> State Historic Park. A total of 170 buildings remained. <b>Bodie</b> has been named as California's official state gold rush ghost town.|$|E
50|$|The funeral is well-attended and <b>Bodie's</b> {{over-the-top}} floral arrangement garners compliments. After the ceremony, Proposition Joe approaches Stringer Bell {{to discuss}} sharing his supply for {{a share in}} the Barksdale organization's profits—noting that the word on the street is that the deteriorating quality of the Atlanta product is nearly unacceptable to the junkies. Stringer pragmatically agrees to present the idea to Avon during his next visit to the prison. When he does so, however, Avon angrily dismisses it out of hand.|$|R
5000|$|The title {{refers to}} the {{disposable}} cell phones used by the Barksdale organization. The idiom [...] "put {{on the back burner}}" [...] refers to making something less of a priority, or switch focus to something else. The drug dealer Williamson is put on the back burner as Bell and Stanfield are made the new targets and arresting <b>Bodie's</b> crew becomes less important than the Hamsterdam cops-dealers pact. The title can also refer to the [...] "back door" [...] move made on Lieutenant Daniels by Detective McNulty in getting the investigative targets changed.|$|R
50|$|The Los Angeles {{music scene}} was still {{recovering}} from the Big Hair bands and phony showcases {{as a result of}} the prevalent pay-to-play policies that most of the clubs had during this time, so the Buddha's went south to Orange County and performed at Club Mesa for their first show. They liked the place and returned many times, eventually playing their final show there (which was professionally videotaped). The band also had befriended some San Diego musicians and were invited to play in San Diego's alternative clubs, The Casbah (US music venue) and <b>Bodie's</b> World Famous Dive Bar, but the Buddha's always failed to show up.|$|R
25|$|In 2009 {{and again}} in 2010, <b>Bodie</b> was {{scheduled}} to be closed. The California state legislature worked out a budget compromise that enabled the state's Parks Closure Commission to keep it open. As of 2012, the park is still operating, now administered by the <b>Bodie</b> Foundation.|$|E
25|$|Carver reports Bodie's {{death to}} McNulty as he arrives for work. McNulty rushes {{to read the}} report and throws the sheet across the room in despair. McNulty {{searches}} Poot at his corner and asks him who killed <b>Bodie.</b> Poot refuses to offer him anything beyond blaming the murder on the police for talking with <b>Bodie.</b> McNulty lets him go.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bodie</b> is {{the setting}} for the Kristiana Gregory book Orphan Runaways (1998).|$|E
50|$|Cheyenne {{ran from}} 1955 to 1963, {{except for a}} hiatus when Walker went on strike for better terms (1958-1959); among other demands, the actor wanted {{increased}} residuals, a reduction of the 50-percent cut of personal appearance payments {{that had to be}} turned over to Warner Brothers, and a release from the restriction of recording music only for the company's own label. The interim saw the introduction of a virtual Bodie-clone called Bronco Layne, played by Ty Hardin, born in New York City but raised in Texas. Hardin was featured as the quasi main character during <b>Bodie's</b> absence. When Warners renegotiated Walker's contract and the actor returned to the show in 1959, Bronco was spun off as a show in its own right and became independently successful.|$|R

5000|$|Bubbles tracks down Kima Greggs {{and tells}} {{her about the}} other junkie who has been assaulting and robbing him constantly. She tells him that, as a {{homicide}} detective, there is little she can do for him, but offers {{to put him in}} touch with Herc. The latter meets Bubbles and tells him he's looking for Little Kevin. Bubbles reuses his [...] "hat trick" [...] from season 1, visiting <b>Bodie's</b> crew, pretending to sell hats, and placing a red hat on Kevin as Herc watches from a distance. As Herc and Dozerman see the red hat go onto the real Little Kevin, the fattest member of the crew, they are both chagrinned at their earlier stupidity in not having realized that Kevin's nickname was ironic. In return, Herc promises Bubbles to come within five minutes the next time his aggressor shows up again.|$|R
