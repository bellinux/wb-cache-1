40|$|The gut caeca of B. microplus {{were studied}} by light {{microscopy}} using paraffin and methacrylate embedded material. It {{has been shown}} that during feeding of nymphs and adults, the midgut consists of five cell types, stem cell, digest cell, secretory cells (s) and (s) and <b>basophilic</b> <b>cell.</b> The stem cell differentiates into any of the other cell types. The digest cell matures through a series of stages and has up to three generations during feeding on the host. The final generation has two distinct cell types, the first type is thought to be capable of both phagocytosis and pinocytosis. Cells of the second type are predominant at the end of feeding, and may be specialized to ingest and digest haemoglobin. The final stage of the digest series is the spent digest cell which discharges its content into the gut lumen or is excreted whole. The <b>basophilic</b> <b>cell</b> has structures which suggest that one of its functions is to transport digested materials, water and ions across the gut. Secretory cell (s) secretes a glycoprotein which may be a haemolysin and secretory cell (s) secretes the gut "colloid" mass, an acid mucopolysaccharide, which may function as an anticoagulant. Intracellular digestion leads to the breakdown of host blood and storage of lipid and glycogen in the digest cells...|$|E
40|$|Basophils are {{implicated in}} the {{pathogenesis}} of the late-phase allergic reaction, but the mechanisms by which circulating basophils adhere to vascular endothelium and migrate to lesional sites remain unclear. In order to assess the biological similarity of the <b>basophilic</b> <b>cell</b> line KU- 812 to normal human basophils, we have compared the adhesion response of this cell line and normal basophils, following challenge with interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and RANTES. We demonstrate here that IL- 8 and RANTES are able to stimulate the adherence of the <b>basophilic</b> <b>cell</b> line, KU- 812, to cytokine-activated human umbilical vein endothelium (HUVEC). The chemokine-induced increase in adhesion was dose-related and was maximal after prior priming with IL- 5. The stimulation of adhesion was partially inhibited by co-incubation with anti-CD 18 and anti-CD 11 c antibodies and antibodies to the beta 1 -integrins. In comparison, the chemokine-induced adhesion of normal human basophils was only inhibited by the beta 2 -integrins. These chemokines were also able to induce the migration of KU- 812 in a dose-dependent manner, but only after prior treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or IL- 5. In all cases tested, IL- 8 was more potent and efficacious than RANTES. We conclude from these studies that these members of the chemokine superfamily may {{play an important role}} in the recruitment of reactive leukocytes in allergic inflammation, by stimulating their adhesion and subsequent migration from the vasculature into the inflammatory sites. However, it is apparent that KU- 812 is not an adequate substitute for normal human basophils in order to investigate chemokine biology...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the role}} of {{secreted}} immunoglobulin D (IgD) remains still largely unknown, previous {{studies have suggested that}} secreted IgD could induce basophils degranulation in some allergic asthma patients. In the present study we have searched direct evidence of the action of IgD on KU 812 cells, generally classified as an immature <b>basophilic</b> <b>cell</b> line. We analyzed by flow cytometry the capacity of IgD, purified from IgD myeloma sera, to bind KU 812 cells. Biotinylated monomeric IgD (mIgD) and biotinylated oligomeric IgD (oIgD) could bind KU 812 cells. Blocking experiments with others immunoglobulin isotypes showed that KU 812 cells expressed an unspecific receptor for IgD. However, oIgD but not mIgD enhances the release of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) from KU 812 cells. On the other hand, mIgD and oIgD failed to induce histamine release from KU 812 cells or from cord blood derived basophils. Since IL- 6 is known to induce basophil differentiation, we proposed that IgD could be implicated in allergic disorders by stimulating IL- 6 release by prebasophil cells, then IL- 6 could further induce an autocrine maturation of the cells...|$|E

HBsAg-positive ground-glass hepatocytes emerged throughout the liver parenchyma in nearly all transgenic mice during the first 4 mo after birth. The panlobular ex-pression of HBsAg persisted until foci of altered hepa-tocytes appeared (6 to 9 mo of age). Three different types of foci of altered hepatocytes- namely, glycogen-storage foci, mixed cell foci and glycogen-poor foci-developed. Hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas appeared after 11 mo. Orcein staining revealed fre-quent transitions between ground-glass hepatocytes extensively expressing HBsAg and glycogen-storage (predominantly clear-cell) foci containing HBsAg-positive cytoplasmic components. Similar transitions between ground-glass hepatocytes and glycogenotic (clear) cells were often found in diffuse parenchymal glycogenosis at 11 or 12 mo. Remnants of HBsAg-positive material were also detected in mixed cell foci, glycogen-poor diffusely <b>basophilic</b> <b>cell</b> foci, hepatic ad-enoma and hepatocellular carcinoma.

The effect of acteoside on β-hexosaminidase release and intracellular [Ca 2 +]i level from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL- 2 H 3) cells was determined. Also, ELISA {{was used to determine}} the level of histamine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, and interleukin (IL) - 4 on human basophilic (KU 812) cells. The effect of acteoside on <b>basophilic</b> <b>cell</b> viability was determined using the 3 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazolyl]- 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. These results indicated that 0. 1 - 10. 0 µg/mL acteoside inhibits the release of β-hexosaminidase and [Ca 2 +]i influx from IgE-mediated RBL- 2 H 3 cells.

40|$|BackgroundNaturally {{occurring}} IgE-specific IgG autoantibodies {{have been}} identified in patients with asthma and other diseases, but their spectrum of functions is poorly understood. ObjectiveAddress the hypothesis that: (i) IgG anti-IgE autoantibodies are detectable in the serum of all subjects but elevated in asthmatic patients regardless of atopic status as compared with controls; (ii) some activate IgE-sensitized basophils; and (iii) some inhibit allergen-induced basophil activation. MethodsIgE-specific IgG autoantibodies were detected and quantified in sera using ELISA. Sera were examined for their ability to activate IgE-sensitized human blood basophils in the presence and absence of allergen using a basophil activation test, and to inhibit allergen binding to specific IgE on a rat <b>basophilic</b> <b>cell</b> line stably expressing human FcεRI. ResultsIgG autoantibodies binding to both free and FcεRI-bound IgE were detected in patients with atopic and non-atopic asthma, as well as controls. While some were able to activate IgE-sensitised basophils, others inhibited allergen-induced basophil activation, at least partly by inhibiting binding of IgE to specific allergen. ConclusionNaturally occurring IgG anti-IgE autoantibodies may inhibit, as well as induce, basophil activation. They act in a manner distinct from therapeutic IgG anti-IgE antibodies such as omalizumab. They may at least partly explain why atopic subjects who make allergen-specific IgE never develop clinical symptoms, and why omalizumab therapy is of variable clinical benefit in severe atopic asthma...|$|E

No such cells appeared in the lymph draining from the autografts. At this time the homografts were already showing signs of rejection and were apparently dead well before the cellular response in the lymph reached a peak, about 350 hr (14 – 15 days) after the homografts had been applied. During {{the peak of the}} response up to 40 % of the cells in the lymph were <b>basophilic</b> <b>cells</b> and in one experiment such cells were leaving the lymph node at a rate of 200 million per hr. Peripheral lymph (afferent to the popliteal lymph node) draining from the sites of homografts of skin was collected from five sheep. This lymph contained few white cells (< 1000 per mm 3) and showed only an insignificant lymphoid cell reaction. Although the percentage of macrophage-like cells was increased significantly there were few signs of a lymphoid cell reaction; the lymph also contained much amorphous debris. Experiments in which the <b>basophilic</b> <b>cells</b> from the efferent lymph were labeled in vitro with thymidine- 3 H and returned to the sheep by intravenous injections were carried out in six sheep. The presence of the labeled cells in the grafts, blood, and other tissue was detected by liquid scintillation counting of nucleic acid extracts of biopsy and postmortem material and by radioautography. 2 – 3 labeled cells out of every 1000 injected entered the homografts but hardly any entered the autografts. However, labeled <b>basophilic</b> <b>cells</b> that had originated in response to bacterial antigens entered the homografts with equal facility. It is thus hard to believe that the immunological specificity of a lymphoid cell endows it with a specific "homing" capability. Furthermore, in all the experiments the specific radioactivities of the nucleic acids extracted from the blood mononuclear cells were approximately of the same order as those of the nucleic acids extracted from the homografts.

The IgE monoclonal antibody designated 54. 10, induced antigen-specific degranulation of rat <b>basophilic</b> <b>cell</b> line, a property which served {{as the basis for}} the screening assay. Its biological function was demonstrated by a specific macrophage activation that led to killing of schistosomula; no such killing was obtained with anti-schistosome antibodies of other classes or with IgE of different antigenic specificity. The second monoclonal antibody of biological significance was an IgG 1, designated 27. 21 which is reactive in the immunofluorescence staining of surface antigens on intact schistosomula. All three monoclonal antibodies that belonged to the IgG 1 class were effective in mediating killing of schistosomula by complement, with the highest effect exerted by 27. 21. It is thus apparent that the 27. 21 monoclonal antibody is directed against a densely distributed surface antigen on the schistosomula membrane which is possibly involved in the protective immunity.

Whether of clear or chromophilic type, all tumoral cells strongly expressed CD 24 molecule, present on primitive blastema cells. All clear-type RCCs expressed CALLA/CD 10 and 60 % were also villin positive; some were faintly positive for CD 26. CALLA, villin, and CD 26 were not detected in <b>basophilic</b> <b>cell</b> type. HLA class I molecules were variably expressed in almost all cases, but HLA class II were never detected on tumoral cells.

Although mast cells and basophils are major targets of IL 33 and play important roles in IL 33 -mediated Th 2 -type immune responses, the expression mechanism of ST 2 in mast cells and basophils is largely unknown. In the present study, we analyzed regulation mechanism of the human ST 2 promoter in the human mast cell line LAD 2 and <b>basophilic</b> <b>cell</b> line KU 812. Methods: Promoter activity was determined by reporter assay with plasmids carrying the wild-type ST 2 promoter obtained from human genomic DNA and its mutant. The transcription factor binding to the identified cis-element was identified by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The effect of candidate transcription factor on ST 2 expression was confirmed by analyzing ST 2 mRNA level in siRNA-introduced cells. Results: Reporter assay demonstrated that a cis-element of typical Ets-family binding sequence was critical for promoter activity in LAD 2 and KU 812. An Ets-family transcription factor PU. 1 bound to this element in an EMSA. When PU. 1 expression was suppressed by siRNA, sT 2 mRNA level was significantly reduced in KU 812.

40|$|AbstractVesicle rocketing {{has been}} used as a model system for {{understanding}} the dynamics of the membrane-associated F-actin cytoskeleton, but in many experimental systems is induced by persistent, non-physiological stimuli. Localised changes in the concentration of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PI(4, 5) P 2) in membranes stimulate the recruitment of actin-remodelling proteins to their sites of action, regulate their activity and favour vesicle rocketing. The calcium and anionic phospholipid-binding protein annexin A 2 is necessary for macropinocytic rocketing and has been shown to bind both PI(4, 5) P 2 and the barbed-ends of F-actin filaments. Here we show that annexin A 2 localises to the comet tails which form constitutively in fibroblasts from patients with Lowe Syndrome. These fibroblasts are deficient in OCRL 1, a phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate 5 -phosphatase with specificity for PI(4, 5) P 2. We show that upon depletion of annexin A 2 from these cells vesicle rocketing is reduced, and that this is also dependent upon PI(4, 5) P 2 formation. Annexin A 2 co-localised with comet-tails induced by pervanadate and hyperosmotic shock in a <b>basophilic</b> <b>cell</b> line, and in an epithelial cell line upon activation of PKC. In vitro annexin A 2 promoted comet formation in a bead-rocketing assay and was sufficient to link F-actin filaments to PI(4, 5) P 2 containing vesicles. These observations are consistent with a role for annexin A 2 as an actin nucleator on PI(4, 5) P 2 -enriched membranes...|$|E

We synthesized a series of 10 N-palmitoylethanolamide homologues and analogues, varying by the elongation of the fatty acid chain from caproyl to stearoyl and {{by the nature of the}} amide substituent, respectively, and evaluated the affinity of these compounds to cannabinoid receptors in the rat spleen, RBL- 2 H 3 cells and CHO-CB(1) and CHO-CB(2) receptor-transfected cells. In rat spleen slices, CB(2) receptors were the predominant form of the cannabinoid receptors. No binding of [(3) H]SR 141716 A was observed. [(3) H]CP- 55, 940 binding was displaced by WIN 55, 212 - 2 and anandamide. No displacement of [(3) H]CP- 55, 940 or [(3) H]WIN 55, 212 - 2 by palmitoylethanolamide derivatives was observed in rat spleen slices. In RBL- 2 H 3 cells, no binding of [(3) H]CP- 55, 940 or [(3) H]WIN 55, 212 - 2 could be observed and conversely, no inhibitory activity of N-palmitoylethanolamide derivatives and analogues was measurable. These compounds do not recognize the human CB(1) and CB(2) receptors expressed in CHO cells. In conclusion, N-palmitoylethanolamide was, in our preparations, a weak ligand while its synthesized homologues or analogues were essentially inactive. Therefore, it seems unlikely that N-palmitoylethanolamide is an endogenous agonist of the CB(2) receptors but it may be a compound with potential therapeutic applications since it may act via other mechanisms than cannabinoid CB(1) -CB(2) receptor interactions...|$|E
40|$|The gene mutated in {{the human}} disease, X-linked {{agammaglobulinemia}} (XLA), {{is related to the}} Src gene family of cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases and is designated Btk (Bruton's agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase; formerly Atk/Bpk; the human gene is denoted BTK, using capital letters according to the kinase nomenclature). We have recently reported that this gene is expressed in B lymphocytes and that the specific mRNA was undetectable in T cells using Northern blotting. Further analyses of different sources of B and T lymphocytes confirmed this pattern. However, BTK transcripts were undetectable in four plasmacytoma lines. Moreover, as virtually normal amounts of BTK transcripts were found in PBMC from two patients carrying a point mutation in BTK, despite low B cell numbers, we anticipated that the gene would also be expressed in cells of other lineages. The erythroleukemia cell line K- 562, the promyelocytic line HL- 60 and the histiocytic lymphoma line U- 937 were found to have BTK mRNA levels comparable to B cells. BTK mRNA was also detected in monocytes from healthy donors as well as {{in the human}} immature <b>basophilic</b> <b>cell</b> line KU 812, in the human mast cell leukemia cell line HMC- 1 and in the CD 34 expressing myeloblast KG- 1. A similar expression pattern was obtained when BTK protein was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Using a polymerase chain reaction-based analysis, a small amount (less than 1 % of the level in B cells) of BTK mRNA was identified in T lymphocytes. Our findings are compatible with a general expression of the BTK gene in hematopoietic cells, except in T lymphocytes and plasma cells, in which the transcript level is selectively down-regulated...|$|E
40|$|In the cytological {{observations}} of the hypophysis in mice with leukemia or mammary cancer, the author made the classification and calculation of epithelical cells of mouse anterior hypophysis. The results of this experiment were as follows: 1. In the pituitary of mice with leukemia, acidophilic cells decreased in number, while the basophilic particularly chromophobic ones increased in number. 2. In the pituitary of mice with mammary cancer, acidophilic and <b>basophilic</b> <b>cells</b> decreased in number, while the chromophobic ones increased in number. 3. From these findings {{it is assumed that}} the hypophyseal function of mice with leukemia or mammary cancer is hormone-unbalanced...|$|R
40|$|Stimulated {{histamine}} {{release was}} depressed at least tenfold in mitotic 2 H 3 rat <b>basophilic</b> <b>cells</b> {{when compared with}} interphase cells even though both contained comparable amounts of histamine. Antigen stimulation of IgE-sensitized interphase cells initiated an influx of Ca 2 + that preceded secretion of histamine and a similar Ca 2 + influx occurred in stimulated mitotic cells. This strongly suggests that during mitosis there is a dramatic inhibition {{of one or more}} of the steps on the pathway leading from elevated intracellular Ca 2 + to the fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane...|$|R
