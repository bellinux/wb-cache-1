5|$|Proposals in January 2013 {{to improve}} the bus service to the airport {{involving}} turning emergency lanes into bus lanes on the freeway and the <b>Bolte</b> Bridge and putting SkyBus on a myki fare, were challenged by CityLink operator Transurban, because it would limit its toll revenue, and by Melbourne Airport, because it would reduce its car parking profits. Similar objections would apply to a rail link.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} of installing a rail link {{from what was}} originally known as the Broadmeadows line (now the Craigieburn line) to the airport was debated in the 1960s under the <b>Bolte</b> State Government, but with not enough support shown in parliament, the rail project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Hambleton, whose {{call sign}} was Bat 21 Bravo, was {{positioned}} immediately behind the pilot, {{who gave the}} signal for everyone to eject. Hambleton pulled the ejection seat handles and had a moment {{to make eye contact}} with the pilot as his seat rocketed out of the dying plane. A moment later, the aircraft was struck by a second SA-2 and exploded. The remainder of the aircraft's six-man crew—Maj. Wayne L. <b>Bolte,</b> pilot; 1st Lt.. Robin F. Gatwood, co-pilot; and EWOs Lt. Col. Anthony R. Giannangeli, Lt. Col. Charles A. Levis, and Maj. Henry M. Serex—were unable to eject and were listed as missing in action. Their remains were never found.|$|E

5000|$|Prescote had a mill on the River Cherwell, called Boltysmylle in 1482 and <b>Boltes</b> Mill in 1613. By 1654 {{there was}} a [...] "Prescote Mill", {{which may be the}} same as the earlier <b>Boltes</b> Mill. By 1703 the mill was in {{disrepair}} but its remains were still recorded as extant in 1797-98 and 1823. Today only its mill stream survives. The mill's decline may be linked with the manor's transition from arable to sheep farming. In 1547 a Danvers leased land at Prescote to a shepherd, and in 1797 it was reported that most of the 385 acre of the farm attached to Prescote Manor was [...] "old inclosed" [...] pasture.|$|R
5000|$|The 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan was a {{road and}} rail {{transport}} plan for Melbourne, {{the state capital}} of Victoria, Australia, instituted by Henry <b>Bolte's</b> state government. Most prominently, the plan recommended the provision of an extensive freeway network, much of which has since been built.|$|R
5|$|Bradley {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of using nuclear weapons in Korea at a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting on 9 July 1950 at Eisenhower's instigation, but there was no support for the idea. The Army staff sent a cable to Collins in Tokyo suggesting that he seek out MacArthur's opinion. In a teleconference on 13 July, Major General Charles L. <b>Bolte</b> proposed sending nuclear weapons. MacArthur had already turned down Air Force proposals to fire bomb North Korean cities, and suggested that atomic bombs could be used to isolate North Korea by taking out bridges and tunnels. The Army staff considered this impractical. However, on 28 July, the Joint Chiefs decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 bombers of the 9th Bombardment Wing to Guam as a deterrent to Chinese action against Taiwan. Truman publicly denied that he was considering the use of nuclear weapons in Korea, but authorised the transfer to Guam of atomic bombs without their fissile cores. The deployment did not go well; one of the bombers crashed on takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base in California on 5 August, killing the mission commander, Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, and 18 others. The remaining nine bombers remained in Guam until 13 September, when they returned to the United States. The bomb assemblies stayed behind.|$|E
5|$|The cricketer {{refused to}} think that his {{candidacy}} was simply there {{to make up the}} numbers, and he told <b>Bolte</b> as much. The start of the election campaign coincided with the 1954–55 grade cricket finals. Loxton took 7 wickets and scored 129 runs to help Prahran claim the title {{for the first time in}} 32 years, and was hailed as a local hero. It capped off a season in which he topped the competition batting averages and took the most wickets. In a close-run contest, the cricketer defeated the sitting ALP member Bob Pettiona by only 14 votes on the two party preferred count. He was aided by preferences from the Democratic Labor Party (DLP), which had broken away from the ALP during the 1950s, claiming that it was too soft towards communism; fears of left-wing influence was causing great concern in Australian society at the time. Loxton polled 35.70% of the first preferences, well behind Pettiona's 47.25%, but received almost all of the DLP's 13.66% of the vote as preferences to end with 50.04%. The result helped bring Bolte's Liberals to power, and they stayed in office until 1982, by which time Loxton had retired.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{entered the}} Victorian {{parliament}} in 1955, {{and served as}} government whip from 1961 {{until his retirement in}} 1979. At the time of his election, he was the youngest member of parliament, and was given the honour of making the Address-in-Reply, the first speech after opening of the new sitting by the governor, using it to advocate increased lending from the government-owned banks to promote higher levels of home ownership. At the 1958 election, Loxton consolidated his hold on the seat, leading on first preferences (43.67%), and ending with 54.85% of the two party preferred vote to halt Pettiona's attempted comeback. During the election campaign in 1961, a campaign meeting in Prahran that was attended by Premier <b>Bolte</b> and Loxton drew several hundred people and descended into chaos; heckling and some scuffles broke out. At this election, the Liberals' primary vote fell to 41.69% behind the Labor Party's candidate George Gahan 45.29%, and he had to rely on DLP preferences to retain the seat with a reduced two party preferred vote of 52.71%. The Liberals may have been hindered by a how-to-vote card circulated on election day by a third party that had a pro-Liberal headline, but instructed the reader to mark the ALP candidate as their first preference. Loxton managed to secure a court injunction—believed to be {{the first of its kind}} in Victoria—prohibiting further distribution of the material, but not before hundreds of misleading instructions had been disseminated.|$|E

25|$|When <b>Bolte</b> {{was elected}} to Parliament in 1947 the Liberal leader was Thomas Hollway, who also came from Ballarat but was a much more liberal {{politician}} than <b>Bolte.</b> In 1951 Hollway tried to reform the electoral system, which caused a split in the Liberal Party and his replacement by Trevor Oldham, with <b>Bolte</b> as Deputy Leader. When Oldham {{was killed in an}} air crash {{on the way to the}} coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953, <b>Bolte</b> was elected leader.|$|E

Under Sir Henry <b>Bolte’s</b> watchful eye, the Shooters License was established in 1959 and provided Victoria’s first ever funds for game and wildlife management. Important areas of waterfowl habitat were purchased and the Game Research Station at Serindip near Lara was established - now a popular wetland education centre. The shooters license raises over $4 million annually. A new Game License introduced in 1990 raises another $1 million annually.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Sparrow and His Four Children" [...] is a {{story from}} Grimms' Fairy Tales.The story number was changed from #35 to #157 from the 2nd edition onwards. In <b>Boltes</b> Anmerkungen, he {{mentions}} that the tale is from the deep Middle Ages. It {{was taken from the}} seventh sermon in Johannes Mathesius Historien von Martin Luther (1563), but it goes back further to Aesop's fables also. In the 1812 Anhang (appendix), it is listed as coming from “Out of Schuppii Schriften. (Fabul. Hans S. 837. 38.).” It is an almost exact transcription of the story from the 1677? published book.|$|R
5000|$|Following Henry <b>Bolte's</b> {{resignation}} in 1972 as Premier of Victoria, Rupert Hamer become Premier {{and there}} was a tempering of Victoria's car-dominated transport planning, with some new investment in public transport. This was in part due to a social backlash against Melbourne's freeway plans. Kirby welcomed this change, commenting in 1974 that [...] "we have got to get top-grade public transport. In Melbourne we have the makings of the best public transport system in Australia and perhaps {{one of the best in}} the world. But lack of finance has caused it to run down." [...] Kirby lobbied the Hamer Government to order trams, and succeeded, with PCC 1041 (a prototype inspired from a 1965 European fact-finding mission Kirby had been on) entering service (but failing upon launch due to poor electrical equipment, which had been reused from an older prototype PCC 980) in April 1973. Contracts for the Z-class tram, based on PCC 1041, were awarded to Comeng in 1973 with the first Z-class tram entering service in 1975.|$|R

40|$|Comenius and the Catechism Songs - Scholars {{have shown}} great {{concern about the}} "number {{listening}} text" called Catechism song and its versions {{for more than half}} a century. Johannes <b>Bolte's</b> achievements are especially appreciated in Hungary. Firstly, János Berze collected narrative material of a considerable quantity for the Catechism song of the Christian tradition. Furthermore Bernard Heller expounded and analysed this problem in connection with the Echod mi jaudea. In addition, Alexander Scheiber, in the light of the above results, added numerous data to the history of motifs. Doing so, he enriched the literature of this far-reaching issue. As I have observed Comenius' textbook entitled Januae linguarum vestibulum, especially one of its chapters Numeralia, has been left out from the researches so far. Consequently I am trying to analyse this version thoroughly, comparing it with the Jewish-Christian tradition. At the same time the Egyptian hieroglyphs depicting numbers have given the opportunity to clarify some fractal geometrical connections, to present hidden units of pyramids and to explain the inner consistence of the numbers through the esoteric meanings. In addition to the quantitative side of the numbers Comenius' autopsy plays an important role as the evaluation of an associative means in the phenomenology of the living folklore...|$|R
5000|$|Hell Gate was {{the scene}} of notorious lynchings in 1864. Once in the town's history, the Worden and Higgins store had been robbed. Cyrus Skinner, a member of Henry Plummer's [...] "road agent" [...] gang, {{and other members of the}} Plummer gang took up {{residence}} in Hell Gate in late 1863 and began a reign of terror against the townspeople. <b>Bolte's</b> saloon had gone out of business in 1862, but Skinner bought the place in 1863 and reopened the bar. Skinner himself preferred to sit on the safe in the original Higgins and Worden store, leading many in the town to believe that the Plummer gang intended to rob the safe of its $65,000 in gold dust. On the night of January 27, 1864, a group of 21 vigilantes (part of the notorious Montana Vigilantes, who had instituted a reign of terror of their own in the state) from Alder Gulch rode into Hell Gate and rounded up Skinner and the other outlaws. A brief trial was held in Worden and Higgins' store, and four members of the Plummer gang were sentenced to death. Skinner and two others were hanged from a pole which was ripped loose from the town corral and put upright. One was hanged in a barn next to the store, another from a tree outside the store.|$|R

5000|$|The {{settlement}} of Hell Gate {{was founded in}} 1860 by Frank L. Worden and Captain Christopher P. Higgins. Higgins had come through the Hell Gate Valley with Governor Isaac Stevens' railroad scouting party in 1853, and now the two men built a log cabin {{and turned it into}} a store. Worden and Higgins had intended to settle at Fort Owen in the Bitterroot Valley, but instead chose the Hell Gate Valley because it was halfway between Fort Owen and the federal government trading post at Jocko on the new Indian reservation. This, they believed, would draw more traffic than a store closer to either existing settlement. The Worden and Higgins store was the first commercial building in the state of Montana not classified as a trading post. In August 1860, Worden and Higgins brought a pack train of 76 mules over the Mullan Road from Walla Walla to stock the store. Their goods included the first safe in the region. Several other cabins were soon built around the store that same year. One of the town's first residents was Judge Frank H. Woody of Walla Walla. The store was set up in a tent (the town's first structure), but purchased hewn cottonwood tree logs from David Patee, a white settler who had settled near the eastern mouth of the Hell Gate Valley, and quickly built a 16 foot by 18 foot (4.9 meter by 5.5 meter) rectangular building with a sod roof. The men were joined by the town's fourth resident, a French citizen named Narcisse Sanpar. Another new resident was [...] "Captain" [...] Richard Grant, the father of Johnny Grant (co-founder of the Grant-Kohrs Ranch), and who along with David Patee had helped supply the logs the Worden and Higgins store was built with. In December 1860, the Territorial Legislature of the Washington Territory (which at that time included much of what is today western Montana) organized a system of county government, and established Missoula County. Hell Gate was named the county seat, and Montana's first county election was held there in 1861. Montana's first trial was also held in the town (in <b>Bolte's</b> saloon) in 1862 (a man sued a local farmer for killing a horse he had leased to him).|$|R
