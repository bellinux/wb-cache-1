40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to investigate, using {{eye-tracking}} technique, the influence of <b>bottom-up</b> and top-down <b>processes</b> on visual behavior while subjects, na ̈ıve to art criticism, were presented with representational paintings. Forty-two subjects viewed color and black and white paintings (Color) categorized as dynamic or static (Dynamism) (<b>bottom-up</b> <b>processes).</b> Half of the images represented natural environments and half human subjects (Content); all stimuli were displayed under aesthetic and movement judgment conditions (Task) (top-down processes). Results on gazing behavior showed that content-related top-down processes prevailed over low-level visually-driven <b>bottom-up</b> <b>processes</b> when a human subject is represented in the painting. On the contrary, <b>bottom-up</b> <b>processes,</b> mediated by low-level visual features, particularly affected gazing behavior when looking at nature-content images.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study aims to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of top-down and <b>bottom-up</b> <b>processes</b> in the extrastriate cortex of cirrhotic patients without overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE). METHODS: Reaction times (RTs), accuracy and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during the execution of a visual Simon task in 17 cirrhotic patients and 10 healthy controls. Amplitude and latency of the P 1 and N 1 (indexes of <b>bottom-up</b> <b>processes)</b> and of the N 2 pc (index of top-down processes) were measured. RESULTS: Patients were slower than controls, and patients with minimal HE (MHE) were slower than patients without MHE. The distribution analysis of RTs showed that the Simon effect decays with slower RTs in all the groups and that {{the shape of the}} distribution was different in MHE patients. No differences were found between cirrhotic patients and controls for P 1 and N 1 amplitude and latency. In contrast, N 2 pc latency was delayed in cirrhotic patients compared to controls independently of MHE. CONCLUSIONS: In the extrastriate cortex of cirrhotic patients without HE, top-down processes are altered whereas <b>bottom-up</b> <b>processes</b> are preserved. SIGNIFICANCE: The analysis of exogenous and endogenous visual components of ERPs provides a model to study the functional dissociation between top-down and <b>bottom-up</b> <b>processes</b> inside the extrastriate cortex...|$|R

The principal effects of apex predators—namely herbivore and mesopredator population suppression—are often evident following their removal from environments, or their reintroduction, including rewilding initiatives.

Furthermore, collective intelligence {{was found to be}} related to a group's cognitive diversity including thinking styles and perspectives. Groups that are moderately diverse in cognitive style have higher collective intelligence than those who are very similar in cognitive style or very different. Consequently, groups where members are too similar to each other lack the variety of perspectives and skills needed to perform well. On the other hand, groups whose members are too different seem to have difficulties to communicate and coordinate effectively.|$|R

The proposed algorithm integrates top-down and <b>bottom-up</b> <b>processes</b> in a balanced manner, employing both appearance and motion cues at different perceptual levels. Without requiring manually segmented training data, the algorithm employs a simple top-down procedure to capture the high-level cue of object familiarity. Motivated by regularities in the shape and motion characteristics of humans, interactions among low-level contour features are exploited to extract mid-level perceptual cues such as smooth continuation, common fate, and closure. A Markov random field formulation is presented that effectively combines the various cues from the top-down and <b>bottom-up</b> <b>processes.</b> The algorithm is extensively evaluated on static and moving pedestrian datasets for both detection and segmentation. 1...|$|R

For Gibson, perception is a <b>bottom-up</b> <b>process,</b> whereby the agent accesses information about the environment directly from invariant structures in the ambient optic array, rather than recovering it by means of complex cognitive processes. More controversially, Gibson claimed that agents can also directly pick-up the various affordances of the environment, or opportunities for the observer to act in the environment, from the ambient optic array.|$|E
50|$|A crucial {{aspect of}} {{research}} lies in whether aesthetic judgment {{can be thought}} of as a <b>bottom-up</b> <b>process</b> driven by neural primitives or as a top-down process with high level cognition. Neurologists have had success researching primitives. However, there is a need to define higher level abstract philosophical concepts objectively with neural correlates. It is suggested that aesthetic experience is a function of the interaction between top-down, intentional orientation of attention and the bottom-up perceptual facilitation of image construction. In other words, because untrained persons automatically apply the object-identification habit to viewing artworks, top-down control to reduce this habit may be necessary to engage aesthetic perception. This suggests that artists would show different levels of activation than non-artists.|$|E

50|$|More recent {{theories}} {{include the}} clustering {{of dark matter}} halos in the <b>bottom-up</b> <b>process.</b> Instead of large gas clouds collapsing to form a galaxy in which the gas breaks up into smaller clouds, it is proposed that matter started out in these “smaller” clumps (mass {{on the order of}} globular clusters), and then many of these clumps merged to form galaxies, which then were drawn by gravitation to form galaxy clusters. This still results in disk-like distributions of baryonic matter with dark matter forming the halo for all the same reasons as in the top-down theory. Models using this sort of process predict more small galaxies than large ones, which matches observations.|$|E

Clark says this research has various implications; not only can there be no completely [...] "unbiased, unfiltered" [...] perception, but this means that {{there is a great deal}} of feedback between perception and expectation (perceptual experiences often shape our beliefs, but those perceptions were based on existing beliefs).|$|E
