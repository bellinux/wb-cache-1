5|$|Between {{the mid-1980s}} {{and the first}} decade of the 2000s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of how hadrosaurids processed their food followed the model put forward in 1984 by David B. Weishampel. He proposed that the structure of the skull permitted motion between bones that resulted in backward and forward motion of the lower jaw, and outward bowing of the tooth-bearing bones of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed. The teeth of the upper jaw would grind against the teeth of the lower jaw like rasps, processing plant material trapped between them. Such a motion would parallel the effects of mastication in mammals, although accomplishing the effects in a completely different way. Work in the early 2000s has challenged the Weishampel model. A study published in 2008 by Casey Holliday and Lawrence Witmer found that ornithopods like Edmontosaurus lacked the types of skull joints seen in those modern animals that are known to have kinetic skulls (skulls that permit motion between their constituent bones), such as squamates and birds. They proposed that joints that had been interpreted as permitting movement in dinosaur skulls were actually cartilaginous growth zones. An important piece of evidence for Weishampel's model is the orientation of scratches on the teeth, showing the direction of jaw action. Other movements could produce similar scratches though, such as movement of the bones of the two halves of the lower jaw. Not all models have been scrutinized under present techniques. Vincent Williams and colleagues (2009) published additional work on hadrosaurid tooth microwear. They found four classes of scratches on Edmontosaurus teeth. The most common class was interpreted as resulting from an oblique motion, not a simple up-down or front-back motion, which is consistent with the Weishampel model. This motion is thought to have been the primary motion for grinding food. Two scratch classes were interpreted as resulting from forward or <b>backward</b> <b>movement</b> of the jaws. The other class was variable and probably resulted from opening the jaws. The combination of movements is more complex than had been previously predicted.|$|E
500|$|In the Solar System, {{the planets}} and the Sun lie roughly {{within the same}} flat plane, known as {{the plane of the}} ecliptic. From our {{perspective}} on Earth, the ecliptic is the path taken by the Sun across the sky {{over the course of the}} year. The twelve constellations that line the ecliptic are known as the zodiacal constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This <b>backward</b> <b>movement,</b> called [...] "precession", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a spinning top wobbles as it slows down. Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a Great Year, the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac. In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the March equinox, one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation Pisces moving back into Aquarius. This signaled the end of one astrological age (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the Age of Aquarius).|$|E

40|$|Based on psychophysical {{evidence}} about how learning of visuomotor transformation generalizes, {{it has been}} suggested that movements are planned on the basis of movement direction and magnitude, i. e., the vector connecting movement origin and targets. This notion is also known under the term “vectorial planning hypothesis”. Previous psychophysical studies, however, have included separate areas of the workspace for training movements and testing the learning. This study eliminates this confounding factor by investigating the transfer of learning from forward to <b>backward</b> <b>movements</b> in a center-out-and-back task, in which the workspace for both movements is completely identical. Visual feedback allowed for learning only during movements towards the target (forward movements) and not while moving back to the origin (<b>backward</b> <b>movements).</b> When subjects learned the visuomotor rotation in forward movements, initial directional errors in <b>backward</b> <b>movements</b> also decreased to some degree. This learning effect in <b>backward</b> <b>movements</b> occurred predominantly when <b>backward</b> <b>movements</b> featured the same movement directions as the ones trained in forward movements (i. e., when opposite targets were presented). This suggests that learning was transferred in a direction specific way, supporting the notion that movement direction is the most prominent parameter used for motor planning...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to measure the energy {{expenditure}} for locomotor activities usually performed by soccer referees during a match (walking, jogging, and running) under laboratory conditions, and to compare forward with <b>backward</b> <b>movements.</b> The sample was composed by 10 male soccer referees, age 29 ± 7. 8 years, body mass 77. 5 ± 6. 2 kg, stature 1. 78 ± 0. 07 m and professional experience of 7. 33 ± 4. 92 years. Referees were evaluated on two separate occasions. On the first day, maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) was determined by a maximal treadmill test, and on the second day, the oxygen consumption was determined in different speeds of forward and <b>backward</b> <b>movements.</b> The mean VO 2 max was 41. 20 ± 3. 60 mL·kg- 1 ·min- 1 and the mean heart rate achieved in the last stage of the test was 190. 5 ± 7. 9 bpm. When results of forward and <b>backward</b> <b>movements</b> were compared at 1. 62 m/s (walking speed), we found significant differences in VO 2, in metabolic equivalents, and in kcal. However, the same parameters in forward and <b>backward</b> <b>movements</b> at jogging velocities (2. 46 m/s) were not significantly different, showing that these motor activities have similar intensity. <b>Backward</b> <b>movements</b> at velocities equivalent to walking and jogging are moderate-intensity activities, with energy expenditure less than 9 kcal. Energy expenditure was overestimated by at least 35 % when calculated by mathematical equations. In summary, we observed that <b>backward</b> <b>movements</b> are not high-intensity activities as has been commonly reported, and when calculated using equations available in the literature, energy expenditure was overestimated compared to the values obtained by indirect calorimetry...|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "rope-a-dope" [...] {{strategy}} : Used by Muhammad Ali in his 1974 [...] "the Rumble in the Jungle" [...] bout against George Foreman, the rope-a-dope method involves lying {{back against}} the ropes, covering up defensively {{as much as possible}} and allowing the opponent to attempt numerous punches. The back-leaning posture, which does not cause the defending boxer to become as unbalanced as he would during normal <b>backward</b> <b>movement,</b> also maximizes the distance of the defender's head from his opponent, increasing the probability that punches will miss their intended target. Weathering the blows that do land, the defender lures the opponent into expending energy while conserving his/her own. If successful, the attacking opponent will eventually tire, creating defensive flaws which the boxer can exploit. In modern boxing, the rope-a-dope is generally discouraged since most opponents are not fooled by it and few boxers possess the physical toughness to withstand a prolonged, unanswered assault. Recently, however, eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao skillfully used the strategy to gauge the power of welterweight titlist Miguel Cotto in November 2009. Pacquiao followed up the rope-a-dope gambit with a withering knockdown.|$|E
2500|$|The central pattern {{generators}} {{responsible for}} locomotion in vertebrates reside as half-center modules in the cervical and lumbar {{region of the}} spinal cord. [...] Each CPG generates a basic motor output pattern {{that is responsible for}} the rhythmic contractions of flexor-extensor muscles that correspond to the forelimbs and hindlimbs. [...] There exist neural substrates that control bilateral limb coordination, particularly in the lumbar spinal circuits controlling the hindlimbs of quadruped mammals. Rhythmogenic potential is highest {{in the center of the}} spinal cord and decreases in a mediolateral direction. [...] The ability to generate fast and regular rhythmic activity decreases in the caudal direction, but the rhythm-generating networks extends from the lumbar region into the caudal thoracic region of the spinal cord. Both lateral and ventral funiculi are able to coordinate activity in the rostral and caudal regions. [...] Although CPGs do exist in humans, supraspinal structures are also important for the additional demands of bipedal locomotion. [...] There are different functional networks controlling forward and <b>backward</b> <b>movement,</b> as well as different circuits controlling each leg. [...] These networks are largely nonoverlapping, although some feedback does exist between them.|$|E
2500|$|Glock pistols are {{designed}} with three independent safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge. The system, designated [...] "Safe Action" [...] by Glock, consists of an external integrated trigger safety and two automatic internal safeties: a firing pin safety, and a drop safety. The external safety is a small inner lever contained in the trigger. Pressing the lever activates the trigger bar and sheet metal connector. The firing pin safety is a solid hardened steel pin that, in the secured state, blocks the firing pin channel (disabling the firing pin in its longitudinal axis). It is pushed upward to release the firing pin for firing only when the trigger is actuated and the safety is pushed up through the <b>backward</b> <b>movement</b> of the trigger bar. The drop safety guides the trigger bar in a ramp that is released only when direct rearward pressure {{is applied to the}} trigger. The three safety mechanisms are automatically disengaged one after the other when the trigger is squeezed, and are automatically reactivated when the trigger is released. This passive safety system omits the manipulation of traditional on-off levers, hammers, or other external safeties as found in many other handgun designs. The ability to fire immediately, without worrying about an external safety, is one feature Glock has stressed as an advantage when selling its guns, especially to police departments.|$|E

Methods Using a three-dimensional motion analysis system, we investigated lower extremity joint angles, joint moments, joint force of the support leg in forward and <b>backward</b> descending <b>movements</b> on stairs, and joint force of the leading leg at landing in 7 female patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Results Compared with the forward descending movement, knee joint angle, joint moment and joint force of the support leg all decreased in the <b>backward</b> descending <b>movement.</b> Joint force of the leading leg at landing was also reduced in the <b>backward</b> descending <b>movement.</b> In addition, we confirmed that the center of body mass was mainly controlled by the knee and ankle joints in the forward descending movement, and by the hip joint in the <b>backward</b> descending <b>movement.</b> Conclusions Since it has been reported that knee flexion angle and extensor muscle strength are decreased in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, we believe that <b>backward</b> descending <b>movement</b> is an effective method to use the hip joint to compensate forthese functional defects. In addition, due to the decreased knee joint force both in the leading and support legs in <b>backward</b> descending <b>movement,</b> the effectiveness of compensatory motion for pain control and knee joint protection was also suggested. </p...|$|R

Failure categorizations were faster when moving backward, whereas success categorizations were faster when moving forward.

Even without Experiment 1 's response procedures, a similar cross-over interaction was obtained (e. g., failure memorizations sped <b>backward</b> <b>movements</b> relative to forward ones).
