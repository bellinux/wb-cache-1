In subsequent years this problem was solved and Humperdinck's additions were not used.|$|E

5|$|Chopin's {{influence}} is marked {{in the first}} two pieces.

In No 2 Nectoux detects the additional influence of Liszt (Au bord d'une source) in the opening bars.

5|$|Flemish {{metallurgist}} and alchemist P. M. de Respour {{reported that}} he had extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in 1668.

For the 1896–97 season, the Ottawa club unveiled the first use of the 'barber-pole' style sweaters of horizontal <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> black, red and white. This basic style would {{be used by the}} club until 1954 except for the 1900 and 1901 seasons, when the team used a plain sweater with only the letter 'O' on the front, identical in design to the sweaters of the Ottawa Football Club, also an OAAA affiliate.|$|E
5|$|II. Andantino in F-sharp minor, A–B–A form. The A section {{presents}} a sparse, lamenting, poignant melody, full of sighing gestures (portrayed by descending seconds). This theme, despite its vastly different character, references the opening <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> the Allegro, an aforementioned source {{of much of}} the sonata's material – the Andantino's first measure shares with the fanfare a second-beat bass note 'echo' after the downbeat on A, creating an audible rhythmic affinity; additionally, the quiet close of the A theme features the fanfare's characteristic pattern of stepwise thirds in the middle voices enclosed between tonic octaves. The middle section is of an improvisatory, fantasia-like character, with extremely harsh modulations and sonorities, culminating in C-sharp minor with fortissimo chords. The chromaticism, triplet emphasis, and modulatory patterns of this section are all reminiscent of the developments nested within the Allegro's exposition. After the C-sharp minor climax (according to Fisk, a key of great importance in the cycle due to its relation to Der Wanderer), a recitative section with startling sforzando outbursts emphasizing an ascending minor second leads to a serene phrase in the major mode (C-sharp major), which in turn leads (as the dominant of F-sharp minor) back to the A section, here somewhat transformed, with new accompanimental figuration. The final <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> the movement feature rolled chords that prefigure the opening of the following Scherzo.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to get Chris into Morningwood Academy, Peter is forced by Carter Pewterschmidt to appear in a remake of the 1997 comedy film Liar Liar. After Chris is {{accepted}} to Morningwood Academy, he is asleep in his bed for the night, and is suddenly attacked by a group of classmates, who stuff wads of dollar bills into their socks, and quickly begin beating him with the weapons. This scene is a parody of that of the infamous sequence shown in director Stanley Kubrick's 1987 war film Full Metal Jacket, in which the Marine recruits take turns striking Private Pyle with <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> soap wrapped in towels as punishment for frequently getting them in trouble.|$|E

5|$|New {{methods of}} {{producing}} it by carburizing <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century. In the Industrial Revolution, {{new methods of}} producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s, Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This made steel much more economical, thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced in large quantities.|$|E

5|$|Other Japanese characteristics, {{including}} the further use of traditional pentatonic scales, continued to crop up elsewhere {{in his early}} works. In the opening <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> Litany, for Michael Vyner (first movement), a reconstruction from memory by Takemitsu of Lento in Due Movimenti (1950; the original score was lost), pentatonicism is clearly visible in the upper voice, which opens the work on an unaccompanied anacrusis. The pitches of the opening melody combine to form the constituent notes of the ascending form of the Japanese in scale.|$|E
