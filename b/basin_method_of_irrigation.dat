40|$|The present {{investigation}} was undertaken {{for the period}} of two years (2004 and 2005) to evaluate the effect of various levels of water and N application through drip irrigation on red hot pepper yield, Water Use Efficiency (WUE) and Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE). In this experiment various combination of three irrigation treatments (Drip irrigation at 0. 5 and 1. 0 xEpan, check <b>basin</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> at 1. 0 xEpan) and three nitrogen levels (50, 75 and 100 % of recommended nitrogen) were compared in split plot design having three replications. The results revealed that when the same quantity of water and nitrogen (100 % of recommended) was supplied through drip irrigation system, it increased the red hot pepper yield to 277. 4 q ha - 1 (an increase of 28. 4 %) under check <b>basin</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation.</b> In check <b>basin</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation,</b> the highest red hot pepper yield (216. 1 q ha - 1) obtained at 100 % of recommended N, while in drip irrigation at 1. 0 xEpan, the yield was highest at 75 % of recommended N. When water and nitrogen was supplied through drip at 0. 5 xEpan, the yield remained statistically same at all the levels of nitrogen, however proved superior over drip irrigation at 1. 0 xEpan at all the levels of N. When half the recommended amount of N was supplied through drip at 0. 5 xEpan.,WUE and NUE increased by 232. 1 and 38. 7 % over check <b>basin</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation.</b> At lower level of drip irrigation 0. 5 xEpan, Root length increased significantly with drip irrigation treatments as compared to check <b>basin</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> and found maximum (36. 3 m) at lower level of drip irrigation 0. 5 xEpan. Thus drip irrigation at 0. 5 x Epan is beneficial for red hot pepper in term of yield, better morphological characters, viz, plant height, number of branches, root length, size and weight of fruits along with 58. 6 % saving of irrigation water over check <b>basin</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation...</b>|$|E

40|$|Efficient use {{of water}} in {{irrigated}} agriculture is as important in areas of plentiful water supply {{as it is in}} water-short areas. Much of the water delivered to the farm for irrigation is lost while applying it to the land because of the system management practices followed. Field-water application efficiency is the precentage of water delivered to a field that is stored in the soil within the root zone of the growing crop. Factors affecting field-water application efficiency in irrigation are climate, soil, crop, water supply, topography, <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation,</b> irrigation system design, and irrigation system operation. Water is applied to the land by four general methods: flooding, furrows, sprinkler, and subirrigation. Each <b>of</b> these <b>methods</b> has charactersitic water losses, but all losses can be classified under evaporation, deep percolation, or runoff. Water-application efficiency studies have been conducted at a number of locations in the United States.

30|$|At present, most pecan growers {{base their}} {{irrigation}} scheduling on intuition or by counting the calendar {{days since the}} last <b>irrigation.</b> This <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> scheduling can lead to over irrigation.

This {{suggests that there is}} an opportunity for considerable water savings by improving water use efficiency.

A dimensionless solution to the Green-Ampt infiltration method for center pivots is presented to better understand factors that influence runoff. That analysis shows that two dimensionless factors are needed to assess the runoff potential. One scaling factor is based on system design, and the second factor is based on irrigation management. An evaporation routine has also been incorporated to estimate potential evaporation losses that may result from utilization of a specific sprinkler design.

40|$|Irrigated {{agriculture}} faces {{a number}} of difficult problems in future. One of the major concerns is the generally poor efficiency with which our water resources are being used for irrigation. A relatively safe estimate is that about 40 per cent {{or more of the}} water diverted for irrigation is wasted at the farm level through either deep percolation or surface run-off. The other evident problem in future is the growth of alternative demands of water for urban and industrial needs. These uses place a higher value on water resources and, therefore, tend to focus attention on wasteful practices. Irrigation science in future will, thus, face the problem of maximizing the efficiency <b>of</b> our <b>irrigation</b> systems.
