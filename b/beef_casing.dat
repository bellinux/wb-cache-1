40|$|Albuterol, which {{increases}} the muscle mass and decreases the adipose tissue, is misused as nutrient repartitioning agent in livestock. Hence, a new sensitive method for determination of albuterol in livestock is presented. Four nano-baskets of calix[4]arene-crown- 6 were synthesized and used to prepare nano-based bended-phases of HPLC–UV. The new synthesized bonded-phases were characterized and optimized, the bonding interactions of solute:stationary phases were examined and the main interactions were reported. The albuterol level of six samples of livestock meat including pork, pork casing, beef, <b>beef</b> <b>casing,</b> mutton, and mutton casing were analyzed and the results revealed that for the best bonded-phases, the LOD and LOQ were 0. 06 and 0. 20 μg/mL, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Bovine intestines, {{bladders}} and oesophagus {{are used}} {{for the production of}} natural casings ("beef casings") as edible sausage containers. Derived from cattle experimentally infected with FMDV (initial dosage 10 (4) TCID(50) /mL, strain A Iran 97), these <b>beef</b> <b>casings</b> were treated with sodium chloride (NaCl) or phosphate supplemented salt (P-salt). In addition, different in-vitro experiments using <b>beef</b> <b>casings</b> were done on a small scale with other FMDV strains (A Turkey 06, C-Oberbayern and O(1) Manisa) as "proof of principle". Based on the combined results of the in-vivo and in-vitro experiments, it can be concluded that the storage period of 30 days at 20 °C in NaCl is sufficiently effective to inactivate a possible contamination with FMDV in <b>beef</b> <b>casings</b> and that the usage of P-salt does not clearly enhance the inactivation of FMDV infectivity. Storage of salted <b>beef</b> <b>casings</b> at about 20 °C for 30 days is already part of the Standard Operating Procedures (included in HACCP) of the international casing industry and can therefore be considered as a protective measure for the international trade in natural casings...|$|R
25|$|A popular dish among Ashkenazim, as amongst most Eastern-Europeans, is pierogi (which {{are related}} to but {{distinct}} from kreplach), often filled with minced beef. Kishka is a popular Ashkenazi dish traditionally made from <b>beef</b> intestine (<b>casing)</b> stuffed with flour or matzo meal, schmaltz and spices.|$|R
50|$|Although the saveloy was {{traditionally}} {{made from}} pork brains, {{the ingredients of}} a shop-bought sausage are typically pork (58%), water, rusk, pork fat, potato starch, salt, emulsifiers (tetrasodium diphosphate, disodium diphosphate), white pepper, spices, dried sage (sage), preservatives (sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate), and <b>beef</b> collagen <b>casing.</b>|$|R
40|$|Aw as {{possible}} parameter {{for the preservation}} of dried natural casings was studied by investigating the survival of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes during the drying process of the <b>casings.</b> Individual dried <b>beef</b> <b>casings</b> were rehydrated and subsequently inoculated with Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. On day 30 post inoculation, the presence of E. coli and B. cereus could no longer be confirmed, while over 4 log cfu / g casing L. monocytogenes remained. This study indicates that the drying period of 30 days at low aw levels is not sufficiently long to eliminate all bacteria present on the natural casings. Aw solely can therefore not serve as a useful parameter for the correct preservation of dried casings. It is useful to link other parameters such as microbial growth...|$|R
40|$|Natural sausage casings are {{produced}} from the intestines of various species {{and used as}} edible containers for {{many different types of}} sausage around the world. Casings must therefore be fit for human consumption and must meet all food safety and hygiene requirements that apply to food of animal origin. As a hazard analysis of sausages would either focus on the final product or on the meat batter inside the casing, it becomes clear that many studies were done on sausages and only a handful on casings. Salt has been in use for centuries as the main preservative agent of casings and a study was done to determine whether this technique can meet the current microbiological criteria. Results indicate that the antimicrobial properties of salt used for the preservation of casings are sufficient to reduce the bacterial contamination (except for Clostridium spores) well below acceptable levels at a water activity level of 0. 85 or lower during a 30 -day storage period. To prevent the outgrowth of bacterial spores, additional preservation measures should be implemented. In the experiments described the use of the bacteriocin nisin was evaluated to reduce outgrowth of spores in desalinated casings. Additionally, the binding of nisin to casings, using 14 C-labeled nisin Z and subsequent bioavailability of nisin were evaluated. Results demonstrate that nisin is bound to casings but if sufficient nisin was present the outgrowth of Clostridium spores in this model was reduced. Neural and lymphoid tissue can be regarded as marker tissues for the potential presence of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) disease-specific prion protein (PrPPScP). These tissue types can also be present in cleaned <b>beef</b> <b>casings.</b> Based on the results from a quantitative histological analysis it was calculated that a standard 200 g sausage produced in <b>beef</b> <b>casings</b> contains 0. 09 g lymphoid and 0. 02 g neural tissue originating from the casing. Using these quantitative histological results a BSE infectivity risk - consumer exposure assessment was made, indicating that the potential risk when consuming a sausage produced in <b>beef</b> <b>casings</b> is far less than consuming a T-bone steak from the same animal. Casings {{are produced}} and shipped {{all over the world and}} this trans-global movement of casings means that restrictive measures, implemented to prevent the spread of contagious animal diseases, are also applicable. Two studies describe the efficacy of FMD and CSF virus inactivation in cleaned casings, either by salt (NaCl) or by using phosphate supplemented salt. After storage at about 20 C for 30 days, no remaining FMDV infectivity was found after either treatment, whereas casings stored at 4 oC still contained infectivity. CSFV infectivity was no longer present after treatment with phosphate supplemented salt and storage for 30 days at either 4 oC or 20 oC. To verify that phosphate supplemented salt was used, a commercially available phosphate assay kit was validated for the qualitative determination of phosphate present in treated casings without interference of naturally occurring phosphate in salt used for brines in which casings are preserved...|$|R
40|$|Lactic acid {{concentration}} correlated with organoleptic spoilage of refrigerated, coarsely ground <b>beef</b> stored in <b>casings</b> with low oxygen permeability. The samples were assayed over time for lactic {{acid concentration}}, total aerobic plate count, percentage of gram-positive organisms, and pH. Lactic acid increased in all samples, {{as did the}} bacterial counts and percentage of gram-positive organisms in the total microflora, the latter representing {{an increase in the}} lactic acid-producing bacteria. pH was found to decrease in all samples, with the smallest decrease in pH being observed in the meat sample which maintained the lowest proportion of gram-positive organisms. With samples evaluated by a sensory panel, lactic acid levels were found to correlate inversely with odor acceptability...|$|R
