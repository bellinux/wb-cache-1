5|$|Antiquarians like John Aubrey and William Stukeley {{first took}} an {{interest}} in the site during the 18th century. It later received archaeological attention, although it has not been excavated. Local folklore has grown up around the circle, associating it with the Devil and with children petrified into rock. The Nine Stones are regarded as a sacred site by local Druids, who perform religious ceremonies there. The circle is adjacent to the A35 road and encircled <b>by</b> <b>trees.</b> The site is owned by English Heritage and is open without charge to visitors.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ghats {{are home}} to four {{tropical}} and subtropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregions – the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests, North Western Ghats montane rain forests, South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests, and South Western Ghats montane rain forests. The northern portion of the range is generally drier than the southern portion, and at lower elevations makes up the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests ecoregion, with mostly deciduous forests made up predominantly of teak. Above 1,000 meters elevation are the cooler and wetter North Western Ghats montane rain forests, whose evergreen forests are characterised <b>by</b> <b>trees</b> of family Lauraceae.|$|E
5|$|The {{city and}} {{government}} {{decided to change}} the type of development allowed near the river. The floodplain bordering the Red River was converted into a large park known as the Greater Grand Forks Greenway. This provided new recreation space for city residents, as well as space for future floodwaters to be absorbed naturally <b>by</b> <b>trees</b> and other plants, without damage to infrastructure. East Grand Forks developed a related greenway park on its side of the river, as it has also suffered extensive flooding that year.|$|E

Voyeurism (spying on people engaged in intimate behaviours) is shown throughout the entire work amongst almost all of the people.|$|E
5|$|After exiting Wellington Corner, NY175 enters another hamlet called Cards Corners. There {{are a few}} {{businesses}} in this hamlet, with NY175 and nearby Cedarvale Road being the major roads. The highway then enters a large forested area, at times surrounded <b>by</b> <b>trees.</b> NY175 continues northeast, passing by several more businesses and soon crosses into the town of Onondaga. In Onondaga, the route passes by the Gen. Orrin Hutchinson House and the Onondaga Community College, intersecting with two consecutive county roads along the way before joining with NY173. The two roads are concurrent for about 0.2miles (0.32km), after which NY173 heads east towards Manlius while NY175 heads northeast towards the city of Syracuse.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival {{house with}} a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade {{of the house is}} five bays wide with 6-over-6 sash and the main {{entrance}} has a Greek Revival portico supported by fluted Doric columns from top step. The simple single-panel door is surrounded by sidelights. The corners of the building have simple pilasters and four chimneys rising from the top. The rear of the house has a one-story veranda with a shallow hipped roof that is supported by square columns with a simple balustrade. The veranda has large 6-over-9 sash windows that extend almost a full story. In 1975, the area surrounding the property has undergone significant change, but the house is surrounded <b>by</b> <b>trees</b> and shrubs and a wrought iron fence that helps set it apart from the neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|Juan caused {{widespread}} {{structural and}} vegetation damage across the region, particularly {{in and around}} the Halifax Regional Municipality. Extensive damage to trees was reported, which blocked many streets and knocked down power lines. Many homes and businesses suffered property damage, particularly roof damage on structures, and some weaker structures were destroyed. HRM estimated that 31% of residential homes suffered some degree of damage and 27% of homes had enough damage to warrant an insurance claim. In Downtown Halifax, erosion-control boulders the size of garbage cans were hurled from Halifax Harbour onto boardwalks and parking lots and piers. The Victoria General Hospital experienced roof and water damage and was evacuated during the storm, as were numerous tall apartment buildings and other multi-family residences. Billboards and signs were also destroyed, and dozens of vehicles were crushed <b>by</b> <b>trees</b> and other debris. The city's cherished Point Pleasant Park and Public Gardens suffered massive loss of trees and remained closed for months.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius torminosus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, {{and as such}} {{plays an}} important role in facilitating nutrient and water uptake <b>by</b> <b>trees.</b> It grows in association with birch (Betula) and hemlock (Tsuga) in mixed forests. It is also known to grow in urban settings when birch trees are nearby. A field study in Scotland concluded that the species is more likely to be present in older than in younger birch woodlands. Fruit bodies grow on the ground, scattered or grouped together. They are a component of the diet of the red squirrel, and serve as breeding sites for some fungus-feeding flies in the Drosophilidae and Mycetophilidae families. Lactarius torminosus mushrooms may be parasitized by the mold Hypomyces lithuanicus, which produces a cream-ochre to cinnamon-colored granular or velvety growth of mycelium on the surfaces of the gills and causes them to be deformed.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{have been}} {{observed}} blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil {{to prevent them from}} leaving their nest during {{the early hours of the}} day. Banded sugar ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving their nest by blocking their nesting holes with debris, a behaviour known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached <b>by</b> <b>trees</b> or other shade, banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area, while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material. Meat ants sometimes attract cats because of the chemicals they secrete (dihydronepetalactone, isodihydronepetalactone and iridomyrmecin).|$|E

These leafhoppers were attacked, suggesting no symbiotic relationship between the two.|$|E
5|$|Route 70 {{crosses the}} Pennsauken Creek into Evesham Township, Burlington County, running east through more {{commercial}} areas within the Marlton {{section of the}} township. A short distance later, the route intersects Route 73 at an interchange that was formerly the Marlton Circle. After the Marlton Circle, the road heads east passing through some more commercial areas and then into residential neighborhoods that are separated from the road <b>by</b> <b>trees,</b> narrowing into a two-lane undivided road. It continues into a mix of suburban development and rural woods and farms as it crosses into Medford Township, coming to a crossroads with CR 618. From this intersection, Route 70 continues east through the Medford area, passing a couple shopping centers before crossing CR 541. After the CR 541 intersection, the route leaves the suburban development and runs through a mix of woodland and farmland with occasional homes. It enters Southampton Township, where the road enters more wooded surroundings before coming to U.S. Route 206 at the Red Lion Circle.|$|E

More scenes in full color, show Derulo on the balcony interacting with her, and also shows him singing to her in the bedroom using a microphone. During another scene, Derulo is seen dressed in all white. The video ends with a kissing scene between the two which then fades away.|$|E
5|$|The falling trees downed {{power lines}} and poles, causing power outages and some {{property}} damage due to the trees and poles hitting houses. One indirect fatality occurred when a motorist drove into a downed tree. Two other vehicles in Franklin County and a fire truck in York were hit and greatly damaged <b>by</b> <b>trees.</b> Downed wires set a Family Dollar on fire in Paradise Township and was believed to have started a fire in a church in Ringtown. Falling trees hit at least eleven houses, with one tree severely damaging a mobile home in Bellwood. Damage directly from the wind was generally minor, and included a house losing a chimney in Camp Hill, a carport being blown over in New Oxford, and at least four houses reporting roof or siding damage. The hurricane also damaged corn fields near Lancaster. Downed trees closed or disrupted traffic on at least 56roads in the region, including U.S. Routes 6 and 322, as well as Interstate 83 in York County.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{from the}} {{hurricane}} was comparatively less in New Brunswick than in Nova Scotia, {{but was still}} considerable. The rough seas impacted ships offshore the province, disrupting the lobster industry. Two groups of lobster fishermen went missing in the Northumberland Strait; they were later found. Thousands of lobster traps and several wharves were either damaged or destroyed in the strait. Hundreds of boats were set adrift or sunk in the strait as well. Several boats in Rothesay and Westfield were also lost. A man in Dixon Point lost CA$1,000of live lobsters due to the storm. A wharf in Shediac was washed away. Fifty boats were sunk off Cap-Pelé, while in Greville, four scows were destroyed. The rising seawater inundated a bridge crossing the Millstream River under 3ft (0.9m) of water. A bridge crossing the Little River and another bridge in Cocagne were also damaged. Dykes in the Baie Verte area were damaged, resulting in {{thousands of dollars in}} damages. Further inland, winds caused infrastructural and agricultural damage. Winds peaked at 85mph (135km/h) at Lakeburn Airport. The strong winds disrupted power and telecommunication services in Moncton. Streets were blocked <b>by</b> <b>trees</b> blown down by strong winds. Offshore, three yachts were destroyed. A tree fell onto the Gagetown United Church {{as a result of the}} winds, causing considerable damage. Grain and apple crops were also destroyed in Gagetown. In Saint John, chimneys were toppled. Flying debris injured several people, and power outages also greatly affected the city. High waves in conjunction with strong gusts scattered boats in the nearby Saint John River. Tents in the Sussex Military Camp were destroyed. The hurricane's effects resulted in a car accident which injured eight people. Though no fatalities were confirmed in New Brunswick, a person went missing in Bathurst, who was later presumed dead.|$|E
