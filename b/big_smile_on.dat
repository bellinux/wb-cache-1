When she first heard that people were dressing up, {{she thought it would}} be tacky, but was surprised to see the depth to which the fans went to recreate her designs.

The film still plays at many theatre locations and Rocky Horror costumes are often made for Halloween, although many require much time and effort to make.|$|E

[...] Berry auditioned in front of the soap's creators, Smith and Tony Holland, and was offered the part immediately.

Berry was already a fan of the soap {{at the time of his}} casting. He has told interviewer Dan Abramson, [...] "I auditioned on a Wednesday and then on Friday I arrived in Albert Square and began shooting my first scenes with Dirty Den, whom I had enjoyed watching on the box for some time.

[...] He described Hank [...] "as a relatively soft-spoken polite guy who quite often had a <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> his face." [...] Behind Hank's public persona, an underlying [...] "good nature" [...] tended to shine through, which fans seemed to recognize.

5000|$|Zeppo's {{parts were}} always {{intended}} to be a parody of the juvenile role often found in sappy musicals of the 1920s-30s era. Sometimes, he would just have a few lines, and he would otherwise be reduced to standing in the background with a <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> his face. In these roles, he was a lampoon of the infamous extra, always grinning widely as a needless decoration, and always stiff and wooden. In other films, Zeppo would have a more significant role as the romantic lead, but he would still always be stiff, wooden, and, yes, with a <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> his face. Either way, he could never be considered a real straight man. He was a sappy distortion of the real thing, and sort of the gateway through which we connected with the other Brothers. We perceived him as the [...] "normal, good-looking" [...] one of the bunch, but was he really? Wasn't there something about that line from The Cocoanuts, 'You can depend upon me, Mr. Hammer,' that was a little too ... happy? Roger Ebert called Zeppo 'superfluous,' and that is the point of his character in the five Paramount films. He was the straight man only in pure Marxian sense—while his Brothers spat on movie clichés, he imitated them, proving in his own way to be quite a brilliant comedian.|$|E
