5|$|North and South Korean forces {{suffered}} {{heavily in}} the battle, each side inflicted large numbers of casualties on one another. The exact numbers of casualties are impossible to determine. <b>Both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> known to have suffered heavily. Following the counterattack at Inchon, the North Korean units in the sector fled back North, {{no more than a}} few thousand troops from the NK 5th and 12th divisions were known to have returned to North Korea. US Casualties, in the meantime, were relatively light.|$|E
5|$|Today the {{battlefield}} {{is a large}} historical site. French positions such as Beatrice, Isabelle, Elaine, Muong Thanh Bridge and De Castries's Bunker have been preserved. Nearly 30 kilometres away from the centre of Dien Bien Phu lays the Viet Minh army complex ranging from shelters and trenches, also preserved in Muong Phang village. A 96 meter underground tunnel connects the working places of General Vo Nguyen Giap and Councillor Hoang Van Thai. In addition monuments and memorials to <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> situated in the region.|$|E
5|$|The holotype of S. angustirostris is a {{skull and}} postcrania, so the cranium {{of the species}} is well-described. Bell et al. re-evaluated the entire species in a 2011 {{publication}} with Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. Their description found the skull to be generalized among hadrosaurines, and are much larger than any skulls of S. osborni. The most unusual feature for a hadrosaurine is the long, protruding, solid crest that extends upwards diagonally {{from the back of}} the skull roof. Unlike lambeosaurines, the crests are made up completely of the nasal bone. The premaxilla bones make up almost 50% of the entire skull length, and <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> filled with small holes. Only in adult individuals has the front of the premaxillary contact been fused. Longer than the premaxilla, the nasal bones are the longest in the skull. They make up the entire length of the crest, and are never preserved as fused.|$|E
500|$|<b>Both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> {{trained in}} a similar manner and used similar equipment. The {{standard}} rifle for <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>was</b> the Model 1808 flintlock musket (a copy of the Charleville musket) and its modification, the Model 1826 Musket, with effective range not exceeding [...] Some units of the Polish infantry were still armed with hunting rifles or war scythes, but contrary to common misconception the scythe-wielding kosynierzy were but a small minority of Polish forces. The artillery used by <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>was</b> mostly six-pounder and twelve-pounder licornes; heavier artillery included twenty-pounders ("half-pood") and 10-pounders ("quarter-pood") cannons. Apart from Russian-made artillery, <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> also used to a lesser extent foreign guns. The forces of <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> a mixture of old, battle-hardened soldiers trained in regular units before the war, and new, unproven recruits.|$|R

5|$|Battles {{take place}} on grid-based {{self-contained}} maps and are governed by a turn-based system where units on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> given their chance to move and act. Once a unit has moved, depending on their position relative to allied units and enemies, they may perform actions such as attacking or supporting allied characters through statistic-enhancing abilities, or they can wait until the next turn. When attacking, the game transitions from the top-down view of the map to a side-view battlefield, where a cinematic battle plays between the player and enemy units. Each unit has access to different weapons and items, but these will break {{after a number of}} uses and must be repaired in between missions. The effectiveness of melee weapons is dictated with the series' recurring Weapons Triangle mechanic: axes are strong against lances, lances strong against swords, and swords strong against axes. Villages found during map battles will be attacked; if defended by the player, non-player characters within the village will give hints about future objectives. A map is cleared when the boss is defeated. If characters fall in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of the}} game. If Roy dies, the game ends and the map must be restarted.|$|E
5|$|The front root {{is larger}} than the back one. In side view, the upper and back margins are straight, but the front margin is convex. There are eight cusps {{arranged}} in a row on the upper margin, the first of which is located about one third of the tooth's length from the front margin. Only the last is slightly worn, indicating that the tooth is from a young animal. Long ridges extend from the cusps diagonally toward the front on both the lingual and labial (outer) sides of the tooth. The first seven ridges on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> connected to the respective cusps, but the eighth ridges do not quite reach their cusp. On both sides of the tooth, there is also a small ridge behind the eighth ridge that extends to the back margin; these ridges are called the posterolabial and posterolingual ridge. An even smaller ridge is located below the ridge on the lingual side.|$|E

25|$|When the colonia was built, a {{large number}} of sculptures were added to the public areas, {{especially}} on Paseo de la Reforma. Lining <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> statues honoring writers, political leaders, and others. One prominent sculpture is that of Cuauhtémoc, for which neighboring Colonia Cuauhtémoc was named. Another is a monument to Christopher Columbus, which was a gift from Antonio Escandon.|$|E
25|$|The medal is {{suspended}} from rectangular ribbon bar (the ribbon {{is in full}} length in the version for army members) of red, yellow, and violet horizontal strips in equal proportion, these were {{the colors of the}} Spanish Republican Flag.

50|$|The Soviet 115th Corps {{reinforced}} the bridgehead and had all its three {{divisions in the}} bridgehead on July 11. The Finns also received reinforcements {{in the form of}} the depleted Finnish Armored Division directly from Ihantala and on July 11 <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> attempting to attack simultaneously. Attempts on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> halted when they ran into attacking enemy formations. Though the Soviets now had access to the fields on the northern <b>side,</b> which <b>were</b> advantageous to the Soviet armor, the Finns were able to stop all further Soviet advances. The following Finnish counterattacks in Vuosalmi at this point amounted to not much success either, and thus <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> on defensive here in mid-July, 1944.|$|R

25|$|Although {{the battle}} {{resulted}} in defeat for the German forces, it served {{the intended purpose}} of the German command of halting the advance of the U.S. Third Army for three months, enabling retreating German forces to make an organized withdrawal to the Sarre river and to organize their defenses. The estimation of casualties for <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> unknown but high.|$|E
25|$|The side facades {{are similar}} to the front and rear, except for the absence of the arched passageway. <b>Both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> in five bays, all windows, on the first floor, with the {{exception}} of a door on the east side. The second-floor openings and balconies match the front with air conditioners generally mounted in the transoms. On the west side one second-floor door has a modern boxed-out bar grille around it.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} subsequently {{stated that}} they would return to Juba and Kampala, as the LRA had broken the agreement, and that the ceasefire agreement would not be extended. The next steps of <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> unclear. Diplomats unsuccessfully tried to restart the talks on 26 April 2008. On 26 May 2008 the government set up a special war crimes court with the mandate to try the LRA {{in an attempt to}} convince the ICC to withdraw its indictments against LRA leaders.|$|E

25|$|Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) {{is a medical}} condition due to compression of the median nerve as it travels through the wrist at the carpal tunnel. The main symptoms are pain, numbness, and tingling, in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the thumb side of the ring fingers. Symptoms typically start gradually and during the night. Pain may extend up the arm. Weak grip strength may occur and after {{a long period of}} time the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away. In more than half of cases <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> affected.|$|E
25|$|Students {{began to}} prepare for {{defensive}} operations in other institutions. They put on a much stronger resistance when {{the police and the}} army tried to occupy the Polytechnic campuses of Zacatenco and Santo Tomas. The battle lasted from 17:00 hours on September 23 to the early hours of September 24. The physician Justo Igor de León Loyola wrote in his book, La Noche de Santo Tomás (Santo Tomas' night): Today I have seen bloodier fights, unequal battles: <b>Both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> armed... but what a difference in the weapons, handguns caliber 22 against military rifles M-1, bazookas against Molotov bombs.|$|E
25|$|Transaction documents—legal drafting—fall on {{a similar}} continuum. A 150-page merger {{agreement}} between two large corporations, in which <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> represented by counsel, will be highly formal—and should also be accurate, precise, and airtight (features not always compatible with high formality). A commercial lease for a small company using a small office space will likely be much shorter and will require less complexity, but may still be somewhat formal. But a proxy statement allowing {{the members of a}} neighborhood association to designate their voting preferences for the next board meeting ought to be as plain as can be. If informality aids that goal, it is justified.|$|E

25|$|Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a {{multiplayer}} first-person shooter {{video game}} developed by Hidden Path Entertainment and Valve Corporation. It {{is the fourth}} game in the Counter-Strike series and was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, with the Linux version released in September 2014. The game pits two teams against each other: the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists. <b>Both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> tasked with eliminating the other while also completing separate objectives, the Terrorists, depending on the game mode, must either plant the bomb or defend the hostages, while the Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the bomb from being planted or rescue the hostages.

25|$|Military {{casualty}} {{figures from}} <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> impossible to verify and are generally {{believed to be}} higher. In September 2000, the National Endowment for Democracy compiled , which, although incomplete and with little factual value, provide a minimum insight in the information war. According to the figures released by the Russian Ministry of Defence on in August 2005, at least 1,250 Russian Armed Forces soldiers {{have been killed in}} action 1999–2005. This death toll did not include losses of Internal Troops, the FSB, police and local paramilitaries, all of whom at least 1,720 were killed by October 2003. The independent Russian and Western estimates are much higher; the Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia for instance estimated about 2,000 Russian Army servicemen have been killed between 1999 and 2003.|$|E
25|$|After the meeting, {{representative}} of the People's Republic of China, Taiwan Affairs Office Director Zhang Zhijun, conveyed words from Xi that the meeting was a new page in history for cross-strait relations. He reiterated Xi's four points to Ma, which are adhering to the 1992 Consensus, developing cross-strait peace, expanding {{the effects of the}} prosperity to more public segments and cooperatively pursuing the Chinese renaissance. Zhang added that Xi agreed to establish the cross-strait hotline that can help both sides communicate with each other, avoid miscalculation and also to deal during emergencies and important matters. Taiwan's participation in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was also encouraged. Xi told Ma that <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> one family, emphasizing the same cultural and blood lineages of both sides of the Taiwan Strait and the improved relations over the past seven years.
