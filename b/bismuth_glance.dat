40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology, {{based on the}} taguchi parameter design approach, for the optimization of process parameters for bismuth recovery from aqueous solutions. The process parameters considered are [Bi 3 +], [NaCl], temperature, and cathodic current density. In addition, cell voltage and current efficiency as two responses have been considered. An orthogonal array L 9, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, and the analysis of variance were {{used to analyze the}} effect of selected process parameters and their levels. From a metallurgical point of view, the separation and recovery of bismuth from a <b>bismuth</b> <b>glance</b> concentrate through leaching, purification and electrowining of chloride solutions were carried out. The optimum conditions for the selected parameter values were found as [Bi 3 +] (75 g/L), [NaCl] (25 g/L), temperature (65 Â°C) and current density (100 A/m 2). Finally, a mathematical model has been proposed and the results of a confirmatory run are reported to verify the results, which indicate that this methodology is more efficient in optimizing the process parameters...|$|E
