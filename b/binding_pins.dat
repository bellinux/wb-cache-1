40|$|The {{microtubule}} binding protein gephyrin plays {{a prominent}} role in establishing and maintaining a high concentration of inhibitory glycine receptors juxtaposed to presynaptic releasing sites. Here, we show that endogenous gephyrin undergoes proline-directed phosphorylation, which is followed by the recruitment of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin 1. The interaction between gephyrin and Pin 1 is strictly dependent on gephyrin phosphorylation and requires serine–proline consensus sites encompassing the gephyrin proline-rich domain. Upon <b>binding,</b> <b>Pin</b> 1 triggers conformational changes in the gephyrin molecule, thus enhancing its ability to bind the beta subunit of GlyRs. Consistently, a downregulation of GlyR clusters was detected in hippocampal neurons derived from Pin 1 knockout mice, which was paralleled by a reduction in the amplitude of glycine-evoked currents. Our results suggest that phosphorylation-dependent prolyl isomerisation of gephyrin represents a mechanism for regulating GlyRs function...|$|R

40|$|Phosphorylation of serine/threonine {{residues}} preceding a proline {{regulates the}} fate of its targets through postphosphorylation conformational changes catalyzed by the peptidyl-prolyl cis-/trans isomerase Pin 1. By flipping the substrate between two different functional conformations, this enzyme exerts a fine-tuning of phosphorylation signals. Pin 1 has been detected in dendritic spines and shafts where it regulates protein synthesis required to sustain the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP). Here, we demonstrate that Pin 1 residing in postsynaptic structures can interact with postsynaptic density protein- 95 (PSD- 95), a key scaffold protein that anchors NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in PSD via GluN 2 -type receptor subunits. Pin 1 recruitment by PSD- 95 occurs at specific serine-threonine/proline consensus motifs localized in the linker region connecting PDZ 2 to PDZ 3 domains. Upon <b>binding,</b> <b>Pin</b> 1 triggers structural changes in PSD- 95, thus negatively affecting its ability to interact with NMDARs. In electrophysiological experiments, larger NMDA-mediated synaptic currents, evoked in CA 1 principal cells by Schaffer collateral stimulation, were detected in hippocampal slices obtained from Pin 1 (-/-) mice compared with controls. Similar results were obtained in cultured hippocampal cells expressing a PSD- 95 mutant unable to undergo prolyl-isomerization, thus indicating that the action of Pin 1 on PSD- 95 is critical for this effect. In addition, an enhancement in spine density and size was detected in CA 1 principal cells of Pin 1 (-/-) or in Thy- 1 GFP mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor of Pin 1 catalytic activity PiB. Our data indicate that Pin 1 controls synaptic content of NMDARs via PSD- 95 prolyl-isomerization and the expression of dendritic spines, both required for LTP maintenance...|$|R

The activation of NFAT involves calcium- and calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation from the cytoplasm, a process that is opposed by protein kinases. We show here that the peptidyl prolyl cis–trans isomerase Pin 1 interacts specifically with the phosphorylated form of NFAT. The NFAT–Pin 1 interaction is mediated through the WW domain of Pin 1 and the serine–proline-rich domains of NFAT. Furthermore, <b>binding</b> of <b>Pin</b> 1 to NFAT inhibits the calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of NFAT in vitro, and overexpression of Pin 1 in T cells inhibits calcium-dependent activation of NFAT in vivo.

40|$|SummaryDuring {{asymmetric}} cell division, the {{mitotic spindle}} must be properly oriented {{to ensure the}} asymmetric segregation of cell fate determinants into {{only one of the}} two daughter cells. In Drosophila neuroblasts, spindle orientation requires heterotrimeric G proteins and the Gα <b>binding</b> partner <b>Pins,</b> but how the Pins-Gαi complex interacts with the mitotic spindle is unclear. Here, we show that Pins binds directly to the microtubule binding protein Mud, the Drosophila homolog of NuMA. Like NuMA, Mud can bind to microtubules and enhance microtubule polymerization. In the absence of Mud, mitotic spindles in Drosophila neuroblasts fail to align with the polarity axis. This can lead to symmetric segregation of the cell fate determinants Brat and Prospero, resulting in the misspecification of daughter cell fates and tumor-like overproliferation in the Drosophila nervous system. Our data suggest a model in which asymmetrically localized Pins-Gαi complexes regulate spindle orientation by directly binding to Mud...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: In {{the fruit}} fly Drosophila, the Inscuteable protein localises to the apical cell cortex in neuroblasts and directs both the apical–basal {{orientation}} of the mitotic spindle and the basal localisation of the protein determinants Numb and Prospero during mitosis. Asymmetric localisation of Inscuteable is initiated during neuroblast delamination by direct binding to Bazooka, an apically localised protein that contains protein-interaction motifs known as PDZ domains. How apically localised Inscuteable directs asymmetric cell divisions is unclear. Results: A novel 70 kDa protein called Partner of Inscuteable (Pins) and a heterotrimeric G-protein α subunit were found to bind specifically to the functional domain of Inscuteable in vivo. The predicted sequence of Pins contained tetratrico-peptide repeats (TPRs) and motifs implicated in <b>binding</b> Gα proteins. <b>Pins</b> colocalised with Inscuteable at the apical cell cortex in interphase and mitotic neuroblasts. Asymmetric localisation of Pins required both Inscuteable and Bazooka. In epithelial cells, which do not express inscuteable, Pins was not apically localised but could be recruited to the apical cortex by ectopic expression of Inscuteable. In pins mutants, these epithelial cells were not affected, but neuroblasts showed defects in the {{orientation of the}}ir mitotic spindle and the basal asymmetric localisation of Numb and Miranda during metaphase. Although localisation of Inscuteable in pins mutants was initiated correctly during neuroblast delamination, Inscuteable became homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm during mitosis. Conclusions: Pins and Inscuteable are dependent on each other for asymmetric localisation in delaminated neuroblasts. The <b>binding</b> of <b>Pins</b> to Gα protein offers the intriguing possibility that Inscuteable and Pins might orient asymmetric cell divisions by localising or locally modulating a heterotrimeric G-protein signalling cascade at the apical cell cortex...|$|R

Anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen, have been used as the first line of therapy for over three decades due to the fact that they elicit cell cycle arrest. Unfortunately, after an initial period, most cells become resistant to hormonal therapy. Peptidylprolyl isomerase 1 (Pin 1), a protein overexpressed in many tumor types including breast, has been demonstrated to modulate ERalpha activity and is involved in resistance to hormonal therapy. Here we show a new mechanism through which CDK 2 drives an ERalpha-Pin 1 interaction under hormone- and growth factor-free conditions. The PI 3 K/AKT pathway is necessary to activate CDK 2, which phosphorylates ERalphaSer 294, and mediates the <b>binding</b> between <b>Pin</b> 1 and ERalpha.

The KSHV Rta protein is the lytic switch for reactivation. Rta transactivates essential genes via interactions with cofactors {{such as the}} cellular RBP-Jk and Oct- 1 proteins, and the viral Mta protein. Given that robust viral reactivation would facilitate antiviral responses and culminate in host cell lysis, regulation of Rta’s expression and function is {{a major determinant of}} the latent-lytic balance and the fate of infected cells. Our lab recently showed that Rta transactivation requires the cellular peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase Pin 1.

Despite Pin 1 ’s ability to stimulate Rta transactivation, unchecked Pin 1 activity inhibited virus production. Dysregulation of Pin 1 is implicated in human cancers, and KSHV is the latest virus known to co-opt Pin 1 function.

40|$|Prolyl {{isomerase}}s {{are divided}} into three groups, the FKBP family, Cyclophilin and the Parvulin family (Pin 1 and Par 14). Among these isomerases, Pin 1 is a unique prolyl isomerase binding to the motif including pSer/pThr-Pro that is phosphorylated by kinases. Once bound, Pin 1 modulates the enzymatic activity, protein stability or subcellular localization of target proteins by changing the cis- and trans-formations of proline. Several {{studies have examined the}} roles of Pin 1 in the pathogenesis of cancers and Alzheimer’s disease. On the other hand, recent studies have newly demonstrated Pin 1 to be involved in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. Interestingly, while Pin 1 expression is markedly increased by high-fat diet feeding, Pin 1 KO mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and diabetic vascular dysfunction. These phenomena result from the <b>binding</b> of <b>Pin</b> 1 to several key factors regulating metabolic functions, which include insulin receptor substrate- 1, AMPK, Crtc 2 and NF-κB p 65.

40|$|Transcription factor LSF is {{essential}} for cell cycle progression, being required for activating expression of the thymidylate synthase (Tyms) gene at the G 1 /S transition. We previously established that phosphorylation of LSF in early G 1 at Ser- 291 and Ser- 309 inhibits its transcriptional activity and that dephosphorylation later in G 1 is required for its reactivation. Here we reveal the role of prolyl cis-trans isomerase Pin 1 in activating LSF, by facilitating dephosphorylation at both Ser- 291 and Ser- 309. We demonstrate that Pin 1 binds LSF both in vitro and in vivo. Using coimmunoprecipitation assays, we identify three SP/TP motifs in LSF (at residues Ser- 291, Ser- 309, and Thr- 329) that are required and sufficient for association with Pin 1. Co-expression of Pin 1 enhances LSF transactivation potential in reporter assays. The Pin 1 -dependent enhancement of LSF activity requires residue Thr- 329 in LSF, requires both the WW and PPiase domains of Pin 1, and correlates with hypophosphorylation of LSF at Ser- 291 and Ser- 309. These findings support a model in which the <b>binding</b> of <b>Pin</b> 1 at the Thr- 329 —Pro- 330 motif in LSF permits isomerization by Pin 1 of the peptide bonds at the nearby phosphorylated SP motifs (Ser- 291 and Ser- 309) to the trans configuration, thereby facilitating their dephosphorylation...|$|R

In the present work, Pin 1 level was found strongly increased during neuronal differentiation and tightly correlated with Tau dephosphorylation at Thr 231. Likewise, we showed in cellular model that Pin 1 allowed for specific Tau dephosphorylation at Thr 231, whereas other phosphorylation sites were unchanged. Moreover, cells displaying Tau phosphorylation at Thr 231 did not show any Pin 1 nuclear depletion. Altogether, these data indicate that Pin 1 has key function(s) in neuron and is at least involved in the regulation of Tau phosphorylation at relevant sites.

Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx), a potent transactivator implicated in HBV-related hepatocar-cinogenesis, has a potential <b>PIN</b> 1 <b>binding</b> motif. This study investigated the interaction of PIN 1 with HBx {{and its role in}} HBV-related hepatocar-cinogenesis. We observed positive correlation of PIN 1 and HBx expression (p = 0. 024) by immunohistochemistry in HBV-related HCCs. Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy conﬁrmed co-localization of HBx with PIN 1 in the nucleus, and co-immuoprecip-itation showed that PIN 1 bound to ectopically expressed ﬂag-tagged HBx in Hela cells. GST pull-down assay further validated the binding between the two proteins. Co-transfection of PIN 1 and HBx transactivated the NF-AT driven luciferase reporter, with two-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with transfection of HBx alone, or PIN 1 -HBx mutants with abolition of Ser/Pro residues at the pSer 41 -Pro motif, which abolished its <b>binding</b> with <b>PIN</b> 1. Cell proliferation was markedly increased with stable PIN 1 -HBx transfectants compared with PIN 1 -HBx mutant transfectants, stable PIN 1 or HBx transfectants alone. Subcutaneous injection of PIN 1 -HBx transfectants in nude mice resulted in development of larger tumors compared with HBx mutants, PIN 1 or HBx transfectants alone. We conclude that PIN 1 interacts with a speciﬁc Serine-Proline motif of HBx and augments its transactivating activity and oncogenic properties. These ﬁndings implicate PIN 1 expression as an important step in HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis and suggest that PIN 1 may be a novel molecular target for inhibition of hepatocarcinogenesis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

There were no live-fire tests of the Mark 14 torpedo, so there were no-live fire tests of its contact exploder.

However, we previously discovered I- 2, but not phospho-I- 2, bound to Pin 1 as an allosteric modifier of Pin 1 substrate specificity [Li, M., et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 292]. Here, we use binding assays and NMR spectroscopy to map the interactions on Pin 1 and I- 2 to elucidate the organization of this complex. Despite having sequences that are ∼ 50 % identical, human, Xenopus, and Drosophila I- 2 proteins all exhibited identical, saturable binding to GST-Pin 1 with K(0. 5) values of 0. 3 μM. The (1) H-(15) N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectra for both the WW domain and isomerase domain of Pin 1 showed distinctive shifts upon addition of I- 2.

In the BMP pathway, Smad 1 phosphorylation by CDK 8 / 9 creates binding sites for the WW domains of YAP, and subsequent phosphorylation by GSK 3 switches off YAP binding and adds binding sites for Smurf 1 WW domains.

They both modulate apoptosis, mitosis, centrosome duplication and neuronal development but until now no functional relationship has been reported between these two proteins. We tested Pin 1 -induced regulation of Survivin in neuroblastoma cells. Pin 1 overexpression in SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells decreased Survivin levels. Immunocytochemical studies indicated that they partially co-localized in interphase and mitotic cells. Co-immunoprecipitation further demonstrates {{the existence of a}} Pin 1 /Survivin complex.

Cellular processes, such as nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis or nuclear export of large ribonucleoprotein complexes, are functionally linked to the disassembly of the nuclear lamina. In general, lamina disassembly is mediated by phosphorylation, but the precise molecular mechanism is still not completely understood. Recently, we suggested a novel mechanism for lamina disassembly during the nuclear egress of herpesviral capsids which involves the cellular isomerase Pin 1. In this study, we focused on mechanistic details of herpesviral nuclear replication to demonstrate the general importance of Pin 1 for lamina disassembly. In particular, Ser 22 -specific lamin phosphorylation consistently generates a Pin 1 -binding motif in cells infected with human and animal alpha-, beta-, and gammaherpesviruses. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we showed that <b>binding</b> of <b>Pin</b> 1 to a synthetic lamin peptide induces its cis/trans isomerization in vitro. A detailed bioinformatic evaluation strongly suggests that this structural conversion induces large-scale secondary structural changes in the lamin N-terminus. Thus, we concluded that a Pin 1 -induced conformational change of lamins may represent the molecular trigger responsible for lamina disassembly. Consistent with this concept, pharmacological inhibition of Pin 1 activity blocked lamina disassembly in herpesvirus-infected fibroblasts and consequently impaired virus replication. In addition, a phospho-mimetic Ser 22 Glu lamin mutant {{was still able to}} form a regular lamina structure and overexpression of a Ser 22 -phosphorylating kinase did not induce lamina disassembly in Pin 1 knockout cells. Intriguingly, this was observed in absence of herpesvirus infection proposing a broader importance of Pin 1 for lamina constitution. Thus, our results suggest a functional model of similar events leading to disassembly of the nuclear lamina in response to herpesviral or inherent cellular stimuli. In essence, Pin 1 represents a regulatory effector of lamina disassembly that promotes the nuclear pore-independent egress of herpesviral capsids...|$|R

Common wheats that have both puroindolines present in their wild form are soft textured, while the various hard kernel phenotypes have mutation or deletion in either PINs.

The protein Inscuteable (Insc) is thought to link cell polarity and spindle positioning in diverse systems by binding the polarity protein Bazooka (Baz; aka Par- 3) and the spindle orienting protein Partner of Inscuteable (Pins; mPins or LGN in mammals). Here we investigate the mechanism of spindle orientation by the Insc-Pins complex. Previously, we defined two Pins spindle orientation pathways: a complex with Mushroom body defect (Mud; NuMA in mammals) is required for full activity, whereas binding to Discs large (Dlg) is sufficient for partial activity. In the current study, we have examined the role of Inscuteable in mediating downstream Pins-mediated spindle orientation pathways. We find that the Insc-Pins complex requires Gai for partial activity and that the complex specifically recruits Dlg but not Mud. In vitro competition experiments revealed that Insc and Mud compete for <b>binding</b> to the <b>Pins</b> TPR motifs, while Dlg can form a ternary complex with Insc-Pins. Our results suggest that Insc does not passively couple polarity and spindle orientation but preferentially inhibits the Mud pathway, while allowing the Dlg pathway to remain active.

BNIP-H interacted with Pin 1 after nerve growth factor-stimulation and they co-localized in the neurites and cytosol of differentiating pheochromocytoma PC 12 cells and the embryonic carcinoma P 19 cells. Deletional mutagenesis revealed two cryptic binding sites within the C-terminus of BNIP-H such that single point mutants affecting the WW domain of Pin 1 completely abolished their binding.

Furthermore, expression of Pin 1 disrupted the BNIP-H/ glutaminase complex formation in PC 12 cells under nerve growth factor-stimulation.

Enzymes such as Pin 1 catalyze cis–trans isomerization, accelerating the otherwise slow isomerization rate into time scales relevant for cellular signaling. Here we have combined NMR line shape analysis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry to determine the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters describing the trans-specific interaction between the <b>binding</b> domain of <b>Pin</b> 1 (WW domain) and a key cis–trans molecular switch in the amyloid precursor protein cytoplasmic tail. A three-state model, in which the cis–trans isomerization equilibrium is coupled to the binding equilibrium through the trans isomer, was found to fit the data well. The trans isomer binds the WW domain with 22 μM affinity via very fast association (approaching the diffusion limit) and dissociation rates. The common structural and electrostatic characteristics of Pin 1 substrates, which contain a phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline motif, suggest that very rapid binding kinetics are a general feature of Pin 1 interactions with other substrates. The fast binding kinetics of the WW domain allows rapid response of Pin 1 to the dynamic events of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in the cell that alter the relative populations of diverse Pin 1 substrates. Furthermore, our results also highlight the vastly different rates at which slow uncatalyzed cis–trans isomerization and fast isomer-specific binding events occur.

It induces potent growth-inhibitory responses in normal cells but promotes migration and invasion of cancer cells. Smads mediate the TGF-β responses. TGF-β binding to the cell surface receptors leads to the phosphorylation of Smad 2 / 3 in their C terminus {{as well as in the}} proline-rich linker region. The serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in the linker region are followed by the proline residue. Pin 1, a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, recognizes phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline motifs. Here we show that Smad 2 / 3 interacts with Pin 1 in a TGF-β-dependent manner. We further show that the phosphorylated threonine 179 -proline motif in the Smad 3 linker region is the major <b>binding</b> site for <b>Pin</b> 1. Although epidermal growth factor also induces phosphorylation of threonine 179 and other residues in the Smad 3 linker region the same as TGF-β, Pin 1 is unable to bind to the epidermal growth factor-stimulated Smad 3. Further analysis suggests that phosphorylation of Smad 3 in the C terminus is necessary for the interaction with Pin 1. Depletion of Pin 1 by small hairpin RNA does not significantly affect TGF-β-induced growth-inhibitory responses and a number of TGF-β/Smad target genes analyzed. In contrast, knockdown of Pin 1 in human PC 3 prostate cancer cells strongly inhibited TGF-β-mediated migration and invasion. Accordingly, TGF-β induction of N-cadherin, which plays an important role in migration and invasion, is markedly reduced when Pin 1 is depleted in PC 3 cells. Because Pin 1 is overexpressed in many cancers, our findings highlight the importance of Pin 1 in TGF-β-induced migration and invasion of cancer cells...|$|R
40|$|The recent crystal {{structure}} of Pin 1 protein bound to a doubly phosphorylated peptide from the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II revealed that <b>binding</b> interactions between <b>Pin</b> 1 and its substrate take place through its Trp-Trp (WW) domain {{at the level}} of the loop Ser(11) -Arg(12) and the aromatic pair Tyr(18) -Trp(29), and showed a trans conformation for both pSer-Pro peptide bonds. However, the orientation of the ligand in the aromatic recognition groove still could be sequence-specific, as previously observed in SH 3 domains complexed by peptide ligands or for different class of WW domains (Zarrinpar, A. and Lim, W. A. (2000) Nat. Struct. Biol. 7, 611 - 613). Because the bound peptide conformation could also differ as observed for peptide ligands bound to the 14 - 3 - 3 domain, ligand orientation and conformation for two other biologically relevant monophosphate substrates, one derived from the Cdc 25 phosphatase of Xenopus laevis (EQPLpTPVTDL) and another from the human tau protein (KVSVVRpTPPKSPS) in complex with the WW domain are here studied by solution NMR methods. First, the proton resonance perturbations on the WW domain upon complexation with both peptide ligands were determined to be essentially located in the positively charged beta-hairpin Ser(11) -Gly(15) and around the aromatic Trp(29). Dissociation equilibrium constants of 117 and 230 microm for Cdc 25 and tau peptides, respectively, were found. Several intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects between WW domain and substrates were obtained from a ligand-saturated solution and were used to determine the structures of the complexes in solution. We found a similar N to C orientation as the one observed in the crystal complex structure of Pin 1 and a trans conformation for the pThr-Pro peptidic bond in both peptide ligands, thereby indicating a unique binding scheme for the Pin 1 WW domain to its multiple substrates.

40|$|Background We {{previously}} reported overexpression of the peptidyl prolyl isomerase PIN 1 in over 50 % of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases related to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its functional role in hepatocarcinogenesis. HBV X protein (HBx), a potent transactivator {{implicated in the}} pathogenesis of HBV-related HCC, has a potential <b>PIN</b> 1 <b>binding</b> motif. We conducted a study {{to test the hypothesis}} that PIN 1 may interact with HBx to exert a synergistic effect in HCC carcinogenesis. Methodology Sections of HCC specimens were immunostained for co-expression of PIN 1 and HBx. The physical interaction between PIN 1 and HBx was studied by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to mutate either 1 or both pSer-Pro sites at amino-acid position 39 to 42 (-SerProSerPro-) of HBx. A total of 7 HBx mutants were generated, and the <b>PIN</b> 1 <b>binding</b> site was determined by repeating co-IP and GST pull-down assays with the various HBx mutants. Subcellular localization of the two proteins was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. The luciferase activity of an NF-AT driven reporter transactivated by HBx expression alone was compared with that transactivated by co-expression of HBx and PIN 1 (wild type or mutants) to demonstrate their synergistic effect. Oncogenicity of a non-tumorigenic human liver cell line (MIHA) doubly transfected with PIN 1 and HBx (wild type or mutants) was evaluated by soft agar assay and subcutaneous injection into nude mice, and compared with MIHA transfected with either PIN 1 or HBx alone. Results PIN 1 positively correlated with HBx expression (p= 0. 024) by immunohistochemistry in HBV-related HCCs. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed co-localization of HBx and PIN 1 in the nucleus, and co-IP showed that PIN 1 bound to ectopically expressed flag-tagged HBx in Hela cells. GST pull-down assay further validated the binding between the two proteins. Mutation of either Ser or Pro in the pSer 41 -Pro motif of HBx abolished its <b>binding</b> with <b>PIN</b> 1. Co-transfection of PIN 1 and HBx transactivated the NF-AT driven luciferase reporter, with two-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with transfection of HBx alone, or HBx mutants with abolition of Ser/Pro residues at the Ser 41 -Pro motif. Both colony formation and growth in soft agar were increased with stable PIN 1 -HBx transfectants compared with PIN 1 -HBx mutants at Ser 41 -Pro, PIN 1 or HBx transfectants alone. Injection of PIN 1 -HBx transfectants in nude mice resulted in larger tumors compared with PIN 1 or HBx transfectants alone. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that PIN 1 interacts with a specific Ser-Pro motif of HBx and augments its transactivating activity and oncogenicity, implicating PIN 1 expression as an important step in HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis. PIN 1 thus represents a novel molecular target for inhibition of hepatocarcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The Drosophila {{neuroblast}} undergoes repeated asymmetric cell {{divisions that}} produce one daughter cell that assumes a neuronal fate {{and another that}} remains a neuroblast. During mitosis, the neuroblast polarizes the conserved Par polarity complex to the apical cortex, {{which is responsible for}} segregating fate determinants to the basal cell cortex. Polarity is accompanied by orientation of the mitotic spindle through the proteins Pins, Mud, and Dlg to ensure that the cleavage furrow properly segregates the fate determinants. The adaptor protein Inscuteable coordinates these two pathways. In my work, I have addressed how asymmetrically dividing cells are dynamically polarized during the cell cycle and how the resulting polarity is coupled to spindle position. To address how neuroblast polarity is dynamically controlled, I identified the protein Inscuteable as a continuously polarized cue for Par complex localization during mitosis. Inscuteable and Bazooka, a member of the Par complex, interact directly and form a complex that is regulated by the mitotic kinase Aurora A. Regulating this interaction allows for cell-cycle dependent establishment of polarity and for the subsequent loss of polarity after the cell divides. To investigate how Par complex directed polarity is connected to spindle position, I investigated the effect of Inscuteable binding on the spindle orientation ability of the protein Pins. When bound to Inscuteable, Pins' spindle orientation activity becomes repressed. Inscuteable competes with Mud for <b>Pins</b> <b>binding</b> and represses the Gai-Pins-Mud signaling pathway. Function of the parallel Pins-Dlg pathway remains unaffected. This repression behavior may allow differential timing of spindle attachment (through Dlg) and spindle shortening (through Mud) pathways that ensures correct alignment of the mitotic spindle. 	I was able to model the spindle orientation behavior of Pins using a synthetic protein containing activation sites that have different affinities for the activator. Changing the number and affinities of these activation sites leads to different response profiles that mimic the ultrasensitive behavior of Pins using a non-cooperative mechanism. Together, these regulatory mechanisms cooperate to allow for spatial and temporal control of polarity and for physical connection of polarity to the mitotic spindle.

40|$|Tumorigenesis is {{a process}} that accumulates {{mutations}} in tumor suppressors and oncogenes, resulting in genomic instability. Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor 143 - 3 ahas been found in 90 % of breast cancers. Of note, these 14 - 3 - 3 σ silenced cells exhibit genomic abnormalities, such as DNA breaks. Similarly, somatic-cell knockout of 14 - 3 - 3 σ in colorectal cancer cell line HCT 116 also showed chromosomal aberrations, suggesting that 14 - 3 - 3 σ is critical in protecting genomic integrity. However, how 14 - 3 - 3 σ maintains genomic stability is still unknown. Our data show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and γ-H 2 AX (phosphorylation of histone M 2 AX) foci are frequently observed in 14 - 3 - 3 σ null cells. In addition, ARF (Alternative Reading Frame) is also upregulated in 14 - 3 - 3 σ null cells. These observations prompt us to hypothesize that 14 - 3 - 3 σ functions to suppress some oncogenes that can cause DNA damage. Because there is a link between over-expression of proto-oncogene c-Myc, ROS induction, and DNA double-strand breaks, we examined whether c-Myc is deregulated, thereby inducing DNA double-strand breaks in 14 - 3 - 3 σ -/- cells. We showed that c-Myc is degraded following the induction of 14 - 3 - 3 σ in HCT 116 cells after DNA damage, while the level of c-Myc is not changed in HCT 116 14 - 3 - 3 σ -/- cells. In addition, robustly ubiquitinated c-Myc was detected in 14 - 3 - 3 σ over-expression conditions. These results indicate that 14 - 3 - 3 σ is essential for c-Myc degradation. Treating 14 - 3 - 3 σ knocked-down cells with c-Myc inhibitor diminishes ROS signal, suggesting that stabilized c-Myc in 14 - 3 - 3 σ null cells is responsible for DNA damage in cells. The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin 1 {{has been shown to be}} an important negative regulator of c-Myc; the association of Pin 1 with c-Myc will result in degradation of c-Myc via the 26 S proteasome pathway. In this study, higher levels of Pin 1 were found to bind to c-Myc after DNA damage, which concurred with the induction of 14 - 3 - 3 σ. Furthermore, the <b>binding</b> affinity between <b>Pin</b> 1 and c-Myc is weaker in the absence of 14 - 3 - 3 σ, suggesting that 14 - 3 - 3 σ enhances the interaction of Pin 1 and c-Myc. Collectively, our studies show that loss of 14 - 3 - 3 σ results in c-Myc stabilization, which initiates DNA damage thereby leading to genomic instability. ...|$|R
40|$|Evidences {{from basic}} and {{clinical}} studies clearly established that mutations of the tumour suppressor TP 53 contribute to carcinogenesis. Unlike {{the majority of}} tumour suppressors, the TP 53 gene is often found to undergo missense mutations, with a strong dominance in the DNA-binding domain. Mutant p 53 proteins contribute to carcinogenesis by losing tumour suppressor activities, by exerting dominant negative effects over the wild-type allele and by acquiring gain-of-function properties. These oncogenic activities enforce tumour growth, EMT, metastasis and chemoresistance. It has been clearly demonstrated that mutations on p 53 are not sufficient to drive tumorigenesis per se but mutant p 53 needs to be activated by specific oncogenic signalling produced by a pro-tumorigenic cellular background to be active as an oncogene. Moreover, understanding what are the environmental factors that account for the selection of specific p 53 mutant forms in different tumours is critical to identify novel determinants of carcinogenesis and to find new putative targets for cancer therapy. Among the frequently mutated residues in p 53, Arginine 249 is replaced in about 65 % of cases with a Serine (mutp 53 R 249 S). Since Arginine 249 regulates the secondary structure of p 53 loops 2 and 3, its substitution is responsible for a local distortion of the molecule, which reaches a dynamic equilibrium between a native and a native-like conformation. Although mutp 53 R 249 S displays an overall low frequency in tumours bearing missense mutations in p 53, it is detected in up to 90 % of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) occurring in populations exposed to HBV infections and aflatoxin B 1 food-contamination, which represent two major risk factors for the HCC in the east of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In these areas, since R 249 S mutation occurs early in the pathway leading to HCC, it is considered an early biomarker of hepatocarcinogenesis. Interestingly, R 249 S mutation is associated to a bad prognosis and to {{the expression of a}} stem cell-associated gene signature. Although in vitro studies show that mutant p 53 R 249 S is able to promote the proliferation of HCC cell lines and that the co-expression with the HBV-oncogene HBx provides further oncogenic properties, a specific mechanism of gain of function is still missing. In this thesis, it is shown that mutation of the Arginine 249 introduces a residue phosphorylated in liver and breast cancer cells, and that the Dual-specificity Tyrosine regulated kinase 2, DYRK 2, is the main kinase for Serine 249 phosphorylation. Moreover, it is provided evidence that Serine 249 phosphorylation creates a new <b>binding</b> site for <b>Pin</b> 1, which is responsible for the distorted conformation of mutant p 53 R 249 S. Cancer cells depleted of mutp 53 R 249 S show an impairment in their proliferation, which is unleashed by Pin 1 activity over mutant p 53. By analyzing the transcription profile of Mahlavu cells upon knocking down of mutp 53 R 249 S, it has been identified the JAK/STAT pathway as molecular axis which sustains the mutant p 53 R 249 S activity. This study unveils a novel post-translational modification signalling converging in mutant p 53 R 249 S required for the gain-of-function of the protein and suggests a possible opportunity for therapeutic intervention.
