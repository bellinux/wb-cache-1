40|$|Introduction: Metallosis {{involving}} the knee joint most often results from metal-on-metal contact {{late in the}} life of a failing implant following polyethylene wear. We report a case of acute metallosis following knee arthroplasty in a previously healthy 59 -year old male. Case Report: In June 2011, the patient underwent left knee arthroplasty for severe osteoarthritis with necrosis and bone edema in the medial femoral condyle and tibial plateau. Nine months later, because of persistent pain and swelling in the joint, revision arthroplasty was undertaken along with partial synovectomy. Examination revealed pristine prosthetic implants in the absence of loose fragments of <b>bone</b> or <b>glue.</b> Synovial pathology exhibited marked chronic inflammation and hyperplasia with extensive finely granular foreign material resembling metallic debris. Laboratory analysis of synovium revealed a predominance of iron, the principal component of the saw blades. Conclusion: We hypothesize the patient experienced acute metallosis resulting from deposition of metallic fragments from three saw blades used during arthroplasty. We believe the increased density of the patient’s bone that required use of multiple blades may have resulted, in part, from heavy lifting the patient partook in during the two years preceding arthroplasty.

Although the sinus lifting procedure has been established for many years now, there are no evidence-based guidelines for perforation closure or indications to interrupt the procedure.

A lateral approach in sinus lifting might be obligatory to securely detect and therefore treat a perforation.

Meanwhile, disposing of refuse became a problem wherever cities grew. Often refuse was placed in unusable areas just outside the city, such as wetlands and tidal zones. One example is London, which from Roman times disposed of its refuse outside the London Wall beside the River Thames.

The low molecular weight agents which cause occupational lung disease have generally included the isocyanates exposure to which could result in asthma among workers. Toluene is also used widely in glue and adhesive industry and households where toluene exposure and abuse can occur. Objectives: To study some respiratory and neurological disorders that may arise in workers in a <b>bone</b> <b>glue</b> factory in Queisna industrial zone, Menoufyia governorate, Egypt. Methods: In a historical cohort study, the exposed participants (n= 50) were recruited from workers in a <b>bone</b> <b>glue</b> factory in Queisna industrial zone, Menoufyia governorate. The unexposed group was selected from workers' relatives who had never worked in glue industry. All participants completed a pre-designed questionnaire on personal and occupational histories. Pulmonary function tests as well as electromyography (EMG) were performed for all participants. Urinary hippuric acid was also measure in all participants. Results: The prevalence of cough, asthmatic attacks and paresthesia were significantly higher among exposed than unexposed participants. Abnormal spirometric measurements (particularly towards obstruction), abnormal EMG and positive urinary hippuric acid were significantly more prevalent among exposed than unexposed group.

In-vitro bioactivity, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and bone adhesion were tested and the results have verified {{that it can be}} used as <b>bone</b> <b>glue.</b> In an in-vitro condition, the prepared nanocomposite (PPF/HEMA/NBG) showed improved adhesion to wet bone surfaces. The combined tension and shear resistance between two wet bone surfaces was measured, and its maximum value was 9 ± 59 MPa. To investigate the bioactivity and biodegradability of the nanocomposite, it has been immersed in simulated body fluid (SBF). After 14 days exposure to SBF, a hydroxyapatite (HA) layer formed {{on the surface of the}} composite confirms the bioactivity of this material. In the XRD pattern of the nanocomposite surface, the HA characteristic diffraction peak at θ= 26 and 31. 8 were observed. Also, by monitoring the weight change after 8 weeks immersion in SBF, the mass loss was about 16. 46 wt%. It has been confirmed that this nanocomposite is a biodegradable material. Also, bioactivity and biodegradability of nanocomposite have been proved by SEM images. It has been showed that by using NBG particles and HEMA precursor, mechanical properties increased significantly. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of nanocomposite which contains 20 % NBG and the ratio of 70 / 30 wt% PPF/HEMA (PHB. 732) was approximately 62 MPa, while the UTS in the pure PPF/HEMA was about 32 MPa. High cell viability in this nanocomposite (MTT assays, 85 - 95 %) can be attributed to the NBG nature which contains calcium phosphate and is similar to physiological environment. Furthermore, it possesses biomineralization and biodegradation which significantly affected by impregnation of hydrophilic HEMA in the PPF-based polymeric matrix.

Material and Methods: Bilateral full thickness critical-sized calvarial defects were created in 15 New Zealand white adult male rabbits. Ten defects were filled with solid scaffolds made of bioactive glass or with porous tricalcium phosphate granules. The healing of the biomaterial-filled defects was compared at the 6 week time point to the healing of autologous bone grafted defects filled with a solid cranial bone block in 5 defects and with particulated bone combined with fibrin glue in 10 defects. In 5 animals one defect was left unfilled as a negative control. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) was used to analyze healing of the defects. Results: Micro-CT analysis revealed that defects filled with tricalcium phosphate granules showed new bone formation in the order of 3. 89 (SD 1. 17) % whereas defects treated with solid bioactive glass scaffolds showed 0. 21 (SD 0. 16) %, new bone formation. In the empty negative control defects there was an average new bone formation of 21. 8 (SD 23. 7) %. Conclusions: According to findings in this study, tricalcium phosphate granules have osteogenic potential superior to bioactive glass, though both particulated <b>bone</b> with fibrin <b>glue</b> and solid <b>bone</b> block were superior defect filling materials...|$|R
2500|$|The salmon {{has long}} been {{at the heart of}} the culture and {{livelihood}} of coastal dwellers, which can be traced as far back 5,000 years when archeologists discovered Nisqually tribes remnants. The original distribution of the Genus Oncorhynchus covered the Pacific Rim coastline. History shows salmon used tributaries, rivers and estuaries without regard to jurisdiction for 18–22 million years. Baseline data is near impossible to recreate based off the inconsistent historical data, but confirmed there have been massive depletion since 1900s. The Pacific Northwest was once sprawled with native inhabitants who practiced eco management, to ensure little degradation was caused by their actions to salmon habitats. As animists, the indigenous people relied not only for salmon for food, but spiritual guidance. The role of the salmon spirit guided the people to respect ecological systems such as the rivers and tributaries the salmon used for spawning. Natives often used the entire fish and left no waste by creating items such turning the bladder into <b>glue,</b> <b>bones</b> for toys, and skin for clothing and shoes. The first salmon ceremony was introduced by indigenous tribes on the pacific coast, which consists of three major parts. First is the welcoming of the first catch, then comes the cooking and lastly, the return of the bones to the Sea to induce hospitality so that other salmon would give their lives to the people of that village. Many tribes such as the Yurok had a taboo against harvesting the first fish that swam upriver in summer, but once they confirmed that the salmon had returned in abundance they would begin to catch them in plentiful. The indigenous practices were guided by deep ecological wisdom, which was eradicated when Euro-American settlements began to be developed. Salmon have a much grander history than what is presently shown today. The Salmon that once dominated the Pacific Ocean are now just a fraction in population and size. The Pacific salmon population is now less than 1–3% of what it was when Lewis and Clark arrived at the region. In his 1908 State of the Union address, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt observed that the fisheries were in significant decline: ...|$|R
