This paper focuses on the analysis of the effect of the normal force and the angular velocity of <b>feeding</b> <b>rollers</b> on the slippage between the paper and the pair of <b>feeding</b> <b>rollers.</b> For this purpose, authors have constructed a testbed and have developed a two-dimensional simulation model to find proper compensation method for the slippage of sheet. Authors also designed and experimentally implemented a fuzzy control system for the paper feeding system that keeps a uniform feeding velocity of paper. Copyright © 2005 IFA...|$|R

50|$|A burster is {{a machine}} that {{separates}} one-part continuous form paper into separate, individual, sheets along the transverse perforations. A burster was typically used with printed continuous form paper applications such as mass-mail advertising, invoices, and account statements. Bursting is done by firmly gripping the second-to-last sheet while <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> grip the last sheet firmly and pull it away to burst the perforation. The continuous form paper then advances into the <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> to burst the next sheet. Bursting is often a high-speed process that allows the continuous form paper to feed in at a steady rate, with burst pages either stacked or fed into a single-sheet conveyance to the next paper processing stage. Burster equipment and paper manufactures had to generate perforation specifications so that the paper perforations reliably separated under the force of pulling the sheets apart and not tear down into the printed part of the sheet.|$|R
40|$|A field-based {{study was}} {{performed}} to broaden our knowledge of operational efficiency losses associated with the neglect of the proper maintenance of the delimbing and feeding mechanisms of a harvester. The post-harvest assessments of industrial round-wood (IRW) processing damage, fuel consumption and productivity were examined in clearcutting operations. Observations were made of seven combinations of wear levels of <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> (A—heavy, B—medium, C and C’—without wear) and sharpening states of delimbing knives (1 —incorrect, 2 —correct), depending {{on the degree of}} <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> wear and matching of angles of knife blades to the technical requirements. The processing defects of IRW were broken down into unprocessed branches, bark stripping, and damage caused by <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> spikes. The results were then compared with the effective quality requirements, and the IRW losses in terms of the reject rates (RR) were determined {{in the context of the}} technical condition. The most frequent damage was by unprocessed branches. The harvester with correctly sharpened knives produced the minimum RR (4 % of pine, 6 % of spruce and 6 % birch logs). The quality of IRW harvested under B 1 and C 1 resulted in 6 %, 6 % and 8 %. A 1 turned out to be the lowest (12 %, 10 % and 8 %). Improvement in the maintenance of delimbing knives can reduce the RR of IRW by 5 %. Timely restoration of worn-out rollers can increase productivity by 2 % and reduce fuel consumption by 5 %...|$|R

The test setup consisted of six boilers equipped with <b>bottom</b> <b>feed</b> burner (BF), one with top feed (TF) and two with horizontally feed burner (HF). Wood pellets used as fuel were DINplus certified. In real life conditions, 20 Â kW <b>bottom</b> <b>feed</b> boiler had the best performance. Emissions of dust from <b>bottom</b> and horizontal <b>feed</b> boilers were better in real life conditions than in standard laboratory conditions. All boiler technologies had lower combustion efficiencies in real life condition (2 - 5 % less) than in standard laboratory condition. Top feed boiler emitted maximum CO (1566 Â mgÂ NÂ m- 3); and dust particles from concerned boiler contained {{a considerable amount of}} elemental carbon. Almost similar NOx emissions were reported with all technologies in real life conditions. All the boilers met emissions and efficiency requirements of Swan Mark (except top feed boilers for CO) and EN- 303 - 5, in both conditions. In laboratory conditions, all <b>bottom</b> <b>feed</b> boilers satisfied emissions and efficiency requirements of Blue Angel, however, in real life situation only 20 Â kW <b>bottom</b> <b>feed</b> and horizontal feed boilers could meet the concerned requirements. <b>Bottom</b> and horizontal <b>feed</b> boiler technologies have advantage over top feed, having lower emissions and higher efficiency.

40|$|Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae {{have adopted}} unique feeding {{strategies}} {{to take advantage}} of behavioral changes in their prey. However, logistical constraints have largely limited ecological analyses of these interactions. Our objectives were to (1) link humpback whale feeding behaviors to concurrent measurements of prey using scientific echo-sounders, and (2) quantify how sand lance behavior influences the feeding behaviors and foraging ecology of humpback whales. To measure, in fine detail, the 3 -dimensional orientation and movement patterns of humpback whales underwater, we used a multi-sensor tag attached via suction cups (DTAG). We tested the specific hypothesis that the diel movement patterns of sand lance between bottom substrate and the water column correlates to changes between surface and <b>bottom</b> <b>feeding</b> strategies of humpback whales on Stellwagen Bank, MA. We collected over 96 h of both day- and nighttime data from 15 whales in 2006, and recorded 393 surface and 230 <b>bottom</b> <b>feeding</b> events. Individual whales exhibit both surface and <b>bottom</b> <b>feeding</b> behaviors, switching {{from one to the other}} in relation to changing light and prey conditions. Surface feeding behaviors were individually variable in their constitution but ubiquitously biased towards daylight hours, when prey was most abundant in the upper portion of the water column. <b>Bottom</b> <b>feeding</b> behavior occurred largely at night, coincident with when sand lance descend to seek refuge in the substrate. Our data provide novel insights into the behavioral ecology of humpback whales and their prey, indicating significant diel patterns in foraging behaviors concurrent with changes in prey behavior...|$|R

40|$|Rotor spun yarn, {{despite its}} growing popularity, suffers the {{disadvantages}} of lower tenacity, limited count range, and harsh {{handle of the}} resulting fabrics. Therefore, this work probes the possibility of eliminating these drawbacks by using tensile drawing. The yarns are produced with different specifications from the same fibers. The results are encouraging, since contrary to predictions, staple yarns treated this way do perform properly. Tensile drawing especially improves rotor spun yarn quality in terms of structural/mechanical evenness and processability. Other features include increased packing density, reduced yarn diameter, enhanced mechanical rigidity, and even the potential for larger tenacity. The influence of processing variables on yarn properties is also revealed by examining {{the contribution of the}} number of yarn loops mounted on the <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> and rewinding to drawing and the resulting products. The number of yarn loops wound on the <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> is significant in terms of drawing tension. Optimum drawing can be obtained without rewinding in terms of better yarn properties and economics, though rewinding can effectively eliminate fiber breakage. Moreover, the truely critical factor in the drawing extent should be drawing tension rather than the so-called drawing ratio. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

This paper presents data to assess whether western gray whale <b>bottom</b> <b>feeding</b> activity, as indicated by visible mud plumes, was affected by seismic operations. The mitigation and monitoring program associated with the seismic survey included aerial surveys during 19 July’ 9 November 2001. These aerial surveys documented the local and regional distribution, abundance, and <b>bottom</b> <b>feeding</b> activity of western gray whales. Data on gray whale feeding activity before, during and after the seismic survey were collected, with the whales assumed to be feeding on the benthos if mud plumes were observed on the surface. The data were used to assess the influence of seismic survey and other factors (including environmental) on feeding activity of western gray whales. A stepwise multiple regression analysis failed to find a statistically significant effect (α’’. 05) of the seismic survey on frequency of occurrence of mud plumes of western gray whales used as a proxy to evaluate <b>bottom</b> <b>feeding</b> activity in Piltun feeding area. The regression indicated that transect number (a proxy for water depth, related to distance from shore) and swell height (a proxy for sea state) were the only variables that had a significant effect on frequency of whale mud plumes.
