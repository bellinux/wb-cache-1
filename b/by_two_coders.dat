40|$|Aims : The aim of {{this study}} was to conduct an {{exploratory}} investigation into the in-session processes and behaviours that occur between therapists and young people in online counseling. Method: The Consensual Qualitative Research method was employed to identify in-session behaviours and a coding instrument was developed to determine their frequency of use and assess whether nuances carried in the meaning of text messages have an influential effect during sessions. Eighty-five single-session transcripts were examined in total <b>by</b> <b>two</b> independent <b>coders.</b> Results: Sample statistics revealed that, on average, rapport-building processes were used more consistently across cases with both types of processes having a moderately strong positive effect on young people. However, closer examination of these processes revealed weaker positive effects for in-session behaviours that rely more heavily on verbal and non-verbal cues to be accurately interpreted. Implications for Practice and Future Research: These findings imply that therapists may focus more on building rapport than accomplishing tasks with young people during online counselling sessions due to the absence of verbal and non-verbal information when communicating via text messages...|$|R

40|$|Predicting item {{difficulty}} is highly important in education for {{both teachers and}} item writers. Despite identifying {{a large number of}} explanatory variables, predicting item difficulty remains a challenge in educational assessment with empirical attempts rarely exceeding 25 % of variance explained. This paper analyses 216 science items of key stage 2 tests which are national sampling assessments administered to eleven year olds in England. Potential predictors (topic, sub-topic, concept, question type, nature of stimulus, depth of knowledge and linguistic variables) were considered in the analysis. Coding frameworks employed in similar studies were adapted and employed <b>by</b> <b>two</b> <b>coders</b> to independently rate items. Linguistic demands were gauged using a computational linguistic facility. The stepwise regression models predicted 23 % of the variance with extended constructed questions and photos being the main predictors of item difficulty. While a substantial part of unexplained variance could be attributed to the unpredictable interaction of variables, we argue that progress in this area requires improvement in the theories and the methods employed. Future research needs to be centred on improving coding frameworks as well as developing systematic training protocols for coders. These technical advances would pave the way to improved task design and reduced development costs of assessments. </p...|$|E

However, very few explored this issue using behavioural coding of couples’ interactions. We conducted {{this study to}} investigate whether observed marital interaction patterns would predict PDA severity. Cross-sectional, pre-treatment multi-center study of 65 married couples in which one spouse was diagnosed with panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA). All participants completed seven self-reported PDA symptoms measures commonly used in PDA research and two self-reported marital measures. Couples were observed during a 15 -minute video-taped problem-solving task. The spouses’ marital interactions were coded <b>by</b> <b>two</b> independent <b>coders</b> using <b>two</b> validated observational coding systems. After controlling for socio-economical variables, the presence of negative marital interaction patterns, namely criticism and dominance behaviour, predicted higher symptom severity, whereas the presence of positive interaction patterns, namely support and validation behaviours, predicted lower symptom severity. Emotional over-involvement of the non-PDA partner, a manifestation of expressed emotions, failed to predict PDA severity. Discord in the couple could exacerbate the PDA and maintain it.

30|$|To ensure {{reliable}} {{data are}} generated, {{it is recommended}} that analysis should be undertaken <b>by</b> <b>two</b> or more <b>coders,</b> who code independently of each other. Rules are developed by the coding team to ensure all coders interpret the items as consistently as possible (Berke and Godschalk 2009). A percentage agreement score is then given, with a score between 70 – 97  % deemed acceptable (Berke et al. 2012). To ensure a higher score, pretesting the protocol is recommended, to improve the reliability of the instructions and score (Berke and Godschalk 2009). However, there are some issues with reliability scores. Percentage agreement becomes more difficult to achieve as the number of coding categories increases (Berke and Godschalk 2009). In our research, there were a total of 127 questions, which affected the reliability score.|$|R

Using a {{content analysis of}} Flemish media and politics, this paper explores prevalent Flemish cultural models of diversity i. e., clusters of ideas and practices of organizing an ethno-cultural diverse society. We analyzed three types of public messages: a) eight political party platforms, b) 45 opinion articles from two newspapers c) along with 307 online commentaries. A coding scheme was developed in a grounded manner and applied to all texts <b>by</b> <b>two</b> independent <b>coders</b> (κ >. 60). Three prominent Flemish diversity models emerged. One model centers {{on the idea that}} minority cultures are “deviant” and that minority members should conform to the Flemish culture. A second model revolves around the idea that immigrants threaten the welfare system. Thus, immigration and immigrants’ social rights should be restricted. A third model is characterized by acknowledging discrimination/stigmatization and by valuing equal opportunities. These three models make different attributions {{about the nature of the}} challenges that come with diversity. It must be noted that minority members are often framed as threatening and these threat frames serve to mobilize support for restrictive integration policies. We will compare these models to frequently studied integration ideologies (e. g., multiculturalism). status: publishe...|$|R
