40|$|Abstract – This paper {{proposes a}} gain {{switching}} algorithm for joint position {{control of a}} hydraulic humanoid robot. Accurate position control of the lower body is a {{one of the basic}} requirements for robust balance and walking control. In general, it is more difficult to perform joint position control of hydraulic humanoid robots than electric humanoid robots because of a slower actuator time constant and the <b>backdrivability</b> of hydraulic joints. Because of the <b>backdrivability,</b> external forces and torques have a large effect on the position of the joints, and external ground reaction forces prevent a simple PD joint controller from realizing accurate joint position control. We propose a state feedback controller for joint position control of the lower body, define three modes of state feedback gains, and switch the gains effectively according to the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) using linear interpolation. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated with a dynamic simulation of a hydraulic humanoid...|$|E
40|$|Since torque in {{harmonic}} drives {{is transmitted}} by a pure couple, harmonic drives do not generate radial forces {{and therefore can}} be instrumented with torque sensors without interference from radial forces. The installation of torque sensors on the stationary component of harmonic drives (the Flexipline cup in this research work) produce <b>backdrivability</b> needed for robotic and telerobotic compliant maneuvers. <b>Backdrivability</b> of a harmonic drive, when used as torque increaser, means that the output shaft can be rotated via finite amount of torque. A high ratio harmonic drive is non-backdrivable because its output shaft cannot be turned by applying a torque on it. This article first develops the dynamic behavior of a harmonic drive, in particular the non-backdrivability, {{in terms of a}} sensitivity transfer function. The instrumentation of the harmonic drive with torque sensor is then described. This leads to a description of the control architecture which allows modulation of the sensitivity transfer function within the limits established by the closed-loop stability. A set of experiments on an active hand controller, powered by a DC motor coupled to an instrumented harmonic drive, is given to exhibit this method's limitations...|$|E

In general, an EMB undergoes parameter variation and a <b>backdrivability</b> problem. For this reason, the cascade control strategy (e. g., force-position cascade control structure) is proposed and the disturbance observer is employed to enhance control robustness against model variations.

40|$|Many {{rehabilitation}} robots use {{electric motors}} with gears. The <b>backdrivability</b> of geared drives is poor due to friction. While {{it is common}} practice to use velocity measurements to compensate for kinetic friction, breakaway friction usually cannot be compensated for {{without the use of}} an additional force sensor that directly measures the interaction force between the human and the robot. Therefore, in robots without force sensors, subjects must overcome a large breakaway torque to initiate user-driven movements, which are important for motor learning. In this technical note, a new methodology to compensate for both kinetic and breakaway friction is presented. The basic strategy is {{to take advantage of the}} fact that, for rehabilitation exercises, the direction of the desired motion is often known.

40|$|According to neuro-rehabilitation practice, active {{training}} is effective for mild stroke patients, which means these patients {{are able to}} recovery effective when they perform the training to overcome certain resistance by themselves. Therefore, for rehabilitation devices without <b>backdrivability,</b> implementation of human-machine synchronization is important and a precondition to perform active training. In this paper, a method to implement this precondition is proposed and applied in a user’s performance of elbow flexions and extensions when he wore an upper limb exoskeleton rehabilitation device (ULERD), which is portable, wearable and non-backdrivable. In this method, an inertia sensor is adapted to detect {{the motion of the}} user’s forearm. In order to get a smooth value of the velocity of the user’s forearm, an adaptive weighted average filtering is applied.

The purpose of this robot is to achieve motions and characteristics that are very similar to a human body. We use a thin McKibben muscle, which is compliant and flexible, as the actuator of a musculoskeletal robot. Using a bundle of thin McKibben muscles, we develop a multifilament muscle that has characteristics similar to those of human muscles. In contrast, the actuators of conventional musculoskeletal robots are very heavy, not densely attached and have poor <b>backdrivability.</b> Because multifilament muscles are light and can be densely attached, we can attach them to the musculoskeletal robot as skeletal muscle and achieve a redundant system that is equivalent to a human drive mechanism. In this paper, we report a method for fabricating multifilament muscles that imitate various muscles, the development of a lower-limb muscle mechanism for the redundant musculoskeletal robot with thin McKibben muscles and experimental results showing that the proposed musculoskeletal robot achieves humanlike motions that have not yet been reported for other robots.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We are {{developing}} a robotic device, PAM (Pelvic Assist Manipulator), that assists the pelvic motion during human gait training on a treadmill. PAM allows naturalistic motion of pelvis actuated by six pneumatic cylinders, which, combined with a nonlinear force-tracking controller, provide <b>backdrivability</b> and large force output at a relatively low cost. PAM {{can act as a}} teach-and-replay device with a PD position controller driving the pelvis onto the reference trajectory specified with or without the help of therapists. During initial experiments with unimpaired subjects, we encountered a problem in which the subjects had difficulty synchronizing their movements with the gait pattern reproduced by PAM, even though that gait pattern had been sampled from the subjects themselves. We introduced footswitches to detect the gait timing and developed a feedback control algorithm that adjusts the play-back speed of the gait pattern in real-time. The feedback algorithm is presented, along with data that shows the effectiveness of the algorithm in synchronizing the robotic assistance during stepping by unimpaired subjects, even when the subjects change their step size and period.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a new mobile haptic {{interface}} for bimanual manipulations in 6 DOFs is presented. The design of this mobile haptic interface {{is based on a}} modular system consisting of two components: two admittance-type haptic interfaces and a mobile platform. While the haptic interfaces cover only parts of the human arm workspace, the mobile platform extends these to arbitrarily wide remote environments. This paper mainly addresses the design and control concepts of the haptic interfaces, which are planned to be mounted on the mobile platform. The interfaces dispose of a large workspace and a high force/torque capability. A special design and control concept of the haptic interfaces makes it possible to decouple translational from rotational movements. This decoupling helps to significantly simplify the control algorithms that handle the interaction between the single components. Evaluation results concerning the Cartesian position tracking performance and the impedance display fidelity are provided. In addition, the following performance measures are analyzed: dextrous workspace, output capability, and <b>backdrivability.</b> In order to reduce the measurement effort, some of these measures are determined by modelbased, others by measurement-based performance evaluation...|$|E

30|$|Musculoskeletal robots {{that have}} tendon-driven systems, mainly using motors, can better imitate the motions and {{characteristics}} of a human than those that have other drive mechanisms. Kenshiro [1, 2] is driven by motors and tendons. The body of Kenshiro {{is similar to that}} of a human because its muscles, bones and joint structures are based on human anatomy. For example, its knee joint is designed to imitate a human one; thus, Kenshiro has the functionality of a kneecap, cruciate ligament and screw-home mechanism in the knee joint using link mechanics, which allows for humanlike motion. ECCEROBOT (Embodied Cognition in a Compliantly Engineered Robot) [3, 4] is also driven by a tendon-driven system. It consists of a skeleton made from a polymorph that has a bone-like appearance and elastic actuators that include motors and elastic tendons to realize motions that are similar to a human. ECCEROBOT is used to test hypotheses about human motion as well as compare its performance with that of humans. However, the actuators of these conventional musculoskeletal robots with motor-driven tendon mechanisms are very heavy, not densely attached to the muscles and have poor <b>backdrivability</b> with respect to the motors, gear wheels and belts. Therefore, these robots do not have a redundancy that is as good as that of a human.|$|E

The inclusion of physical compliance allows estimation of interaction force, enabling force-feedback control and stable rendering {{of a wide range of}} haptic environ-ments during continuous scanning. Through accurate inner-loop velocity compensation and force-feedback control, the actuator is capable of displaying both a low-impedance, subject-in-charge mode, and a high stiffness mode.

The detailed experimental characterization of the actuation system is presented, including a <b>backdrivability</b> analysis, demon-strating an achievable impedance range of 22 dB, within a bandwidth of 4 Hz (for low stiffness). The stiffness control bandwidth depends on the specific value of stiffness: a bandwidth of 4 Hz is achieved at low stiffness (10 % of the physical springs stiffness), while 8 Hz is demonstrated at higher stiffness. Moreover, coupled stability is demonstrated also for stiffness values substantially (25 %) higher than the physical stiffness of the spring.

40|$|The {{advanced}} technology of today {{has reduced the}} need of testing medical equipment on human patients. The invention of the lung simulator {{has made it possible}} to test ventilators without putting the condition of test patients in jeopardy. The device also allows medical staff to be trained in a safe and more rapid way. Several types of lung simulators are available. The digitally controlled variant is the most versatile one for simulations. This type has easily adjustable static and dynamic properties, which, in contrary to traditional passive mechanical simulators, make it possible to simulate different types of breathing. The available design of a digitally controlled lung simulator, however, has one major drawback. The system uses a motor-ball screw assembly to drive a piston in the air compartment. One of the properties of this assembly is that the motor shaft motion is negligibly affected (not ‘backdrivable’) by air pressure exerted on the piston by an external source. The result of this is a feedback system that needs to realize the entire dynamic response to pressure changes, by active control of the motor. Because of this, the system can easily become unstable for certain settings of the static and dynamic properties. The objective of this thesis is to determine what the best alternative actuator is for the lung simulator, to the end of making it more stable than the current version. By improving the existing lung simulator and improving its range of operation, and its performance, it can be made more effective and accurate, which will result in better healthcare. To reach this goal, firstly the desired requirements for the lung simulator will be obtained from the end user. After this, a literature study about alternative actuators shall be conducted. With the results of the literature study, a ranking of the alternative actuators are determined. From the literature study eight alternative actuators have come up. These are the moving coil actuator, moving iron actuator, permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), ironless core motor, piezoelectric actuator, pneumatic actuator, hydraulic actuator and wax motor. The most important requirements on which the different actuators are evaluated are <b>backdrivability,</b> force linearity, force, precision, speed and stroke length. Of the eight alternative actuators, except for the PMSM and the ironless core actuator, all the others have an insufficient score on {{one or more of the}} requirements. A comparison of the PMSM and the ironless core actuator shows that the <b>backdrivability</b> of the ironless core actuator is better, and that it has the best overall score. The conclusion is that the ironless core actuator is the most suitable alternative for the lung simulator. The use of the actuator should increase the stability of the lung simulator. However, no testing was possible because of malfunctioning hardware and time shortage. Therefore no practical confirmation could be obtained about the effects of the new actuator on the system. It is recommended to put the top-ranked actuators to the test in a prototype. From the test results it will be possible to confirm whether the instability of the original lung simulator was indeed caused by the actuator, and whether the ironless core motor is indeed the best suitable alternative actuator for the lung simulator.

Even the control objective itself may be uncertain and require some exploration to determine. Therefore by studying these systems, science and engineering can benefit from the knowledge that will inevitably be gained. Stochastic optimal control has been successfully used to model human sensorimotor behavior in many contexts, and, combined with Bayesian inference, the framework can be extended to address problems where sensorimotor learning must take place. This dissertation contributes a suitable model for sensorimotor learning applicable to a broad class of problems (including, high dimensional, nonlinear, and stochastic contexts). The second contribution is solution methods based on function approximation and techniques for practical application of these methods for producing globally (approximately) optimal controllers. These controllers are compared (favorably) to human subjects performing exploration/exploitation tasks involving redundancy and uncertainty. The active exploration framework developed here {{can be applied to}} artificial systems for creating systems capable of anticipating what a task is and how to achieve the goals.

40|$|In many applications, robots {{have to bear}} large loads while {{moving slowly}} and also have to move quickly through the air with almost no load. These type of bi-modal tasks, with {{conflicting}} requirements in terms of operating speeds and desired impedances, often lead {{to the use of}} oversized and inefficient actuators which are inhibitory particularly for mobile robots. Multiple gear ratios, like in a powertrain, address this issue by allowing an effective use of power over a wide range of output speeds, by enabling significant changes to the reflected intrinsic actuator impedances and by making possible the leveraging or attenuation of the natural load dynamics. This thesis aims to develop the technological solutions needed to use variable gear ratio actuators and exploit the advantages of variable transmissions in a robotic context. First, by addressing the issue of how to make fast and seamless gearshifts between two very different reduction ratios under diverse load conditions, with a solution based on a dual-motor actuator architecture and a control scheme using the null space. Second, by developing control algorithms that select optimal gear ratios dynamically based on state feedback, to move with minimal motor torques and to adjust the output impedance appropriately given a task. The proposed approach exploit variable transmissions not merely for increasing maximum torque and speed, but also to significantly alter the dynamic properties, including load sensitivity, robustness, and <b>backdrivability.</b> Simulations and experiments using a novel lightweight robotic arm using three custom-built dual-speed dual-motor actuators are presented. Results demonstrate very fast gear shifting in highly dynamic situations with dual-speed dual-motor actuators, and show that actively changing gear ratios using the proposed control algorithms can lead to an order-of-magnitude reduction of necessary motor torque and power. by Alexandre Girard.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the pros and}} cons of compliant actuation for rehabilitation robots on the example of LOPES, focusing on the cons. After illustrating the bandwidth limitations, a new result has been derived: if stability in terms of passivity of the haptic device is desired, the renderable stiffness is bounded by the stiffness of the SEA's elastic component. In practical experiments with the VMC, the aforementioned limitations affected the control performance. Desired gait modifications were not tracked exactly, because the subjects were able to deviate from the prescribed pattern even in the stiffest possible configuration. Despite the limitations, the practical experiments also demonstrated the general effectiveness of the realization. Manipulation of selected gait parameters is possible, whereby other parameters are left unaffected. This high selectivity is made possible by the low level of undesired interaction torques, which is achieved by elastic decoupling of motor mass and a lightweight exoskeleton. The discrepancy between theoretical bounds and rendered stiffness indicated that healthy subjects might represent a stabilizing component of the coupled system, which could be different for patients. In light of the theoretical stability analysis and with the focus on patients, the LOPES actuation was slightly modified. The robot was equipped with stiffer springs to obtain sufficient stiffness and to ensure stability without relying on stabilizing effects of the human. For this application, the disadvantages of compliant actuation can thus be tolerated or dealt with, and they are small compared with the advantages. Given that a rehabilitation robot, in the first place, is supposed to imitate therapist action, the limitations of bandwidth and stiffness do not pose severe problems. In contrast, safety and <b>backdrivability</b> are highly relevant, and they can be ensured easier with a compliant actuator. Therefore, we conclude that compliant actuation and a lightw- - eight exoskeleton provide effective means to accomplish the desired AAN behavior of a rehabilitation robot. The next step is to evaluate the robot behavior, control performance, and therapeutic effectiveness in patient studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Following acute {{therapeutic}} interventions, {{the majority}} of stroke survivors are left with a poorly functioning hemiparetic hand. Rehabilitation robotics has shown promise in providing patients with intensive therapy leading to functional gains. Because of the hand's crucial role in performing activities of daily living, attention to hand therapy has recently increased. Methods This paper introduces a newly developed Hand Exoskeleton Rehabilitation Robot (HEXORR). This device {{has been designed to}} provide full range of motion (ROM) for all of the hand's digits. The thumb actuator allows for variable thumb plane of motion to incorporate different degrees of extension/flexion and abduction/adduction. Compensation algorithms have been developed to improve the exoskeleton's <b>backdrivability</b> by counteracting gravity, stiction and kinetic friction. We have also designed a force assistance mode that provides extension assistance based on each individual's needs. A pilot study was conducted on 9 unimpaired and 5 chronic stroke subjects to investigate the device's ability to allow physiologically accurate hand movements throughout the full ROM. The study also tested the efficacy of the force assistance mode with the goal of increasing stroke subjects' active ROM while still requiring active extension torque {{on the part of the}} subject. Results For 12 of the hand digits' 15 joints in neurologically normal subjects, there were no significant ROM differences (P > 0. 05) between active movements performed inside and outside of HEXORR. Interjoint coordination was examined in the 1 st and 3 rd digits, and no differences were found between inside and outside of the device (P > 0. 05). Stroke subjects were capable of performing free hand movements inside of the exoskeleton and the force assistance mode was successful in increasing active ROM by 43 ± 5 % (P Conclusions Our pilot study shows that this device is capable of moving the hand's digits through nearly the entire ROM with physiologically accurate trajectories. Stroke subjects received the device intervention well and device impedance was minimized so that subjects could freely extend and flex their digits inside of HEXORR. Our active force-assisted condition was successful in increasing the subjects' ROM while promoting active participation. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} the control and {{hardware}} systems for a robot intended for interaction with a human user can profit from a critical analysis of the human neuromotor system and human biomechanics. The primary observation to be made about the human control and ``hardware’’ systems is that they work well together, perhaps because they were designed for each other. Despite the limited force production and elasticity of muscle, and despite slow information transmission, the sensorimotor system is adept at an impressive range of motor behaviors. In this thesis I present three explorations on the manners in which the human and hardware systems work together, hoping to inform the design of robots suitable for human-robot interaction. First, I used the serial reaction time (SRT) task with cuing from lights and motorized keys to assess the relative contribution of visual and haptic stimuli {{to the formation of}} motor and perceptual memories. Motorized keys were used to deliver brief pulse-like displacements to the resting fingers, with the expectation that the proximity and similarity of these cues to the response motor actions (finger-activated key-presses) would strengthen the motor memory trace in particular. Error rate results demonstrate that haptic cues promote motor learning over perceptual learning. The second exploration involves the design of an actuator specialized for human-robot interaction. Like muscle, it features series elasticity and thus displays good <b>backdrivability.</b> The elasticity arises from the use of a compressible fluid while hinged rigid plates are used to convert fluid power into mechanical power. I also propose impedance control with dynamics compensation to further reduce the driving-point impedance. The controller is robust to all kinds of uncertainties. The third exploration involves human control in interaction with the environment. I propose a framework that accommodates delays and does not require an explicit model of the musculoskeletal system and environment. Instead, loads from the biomechanics and coupled environment are estimated using the relationship between the motor command and its responses. Delays inherent in sensory feedback are accommodated by taking the form of the Smith predictor. Agreements between simulation results and empirical movements suggests that the framework is viable...|$|E
40|$|Robotics {{have shown}} {{tremendous}} developments, such as industrial robots that assist us in production lines in manufacturing such as KUKA, FANUC and mobile robots in our everyday lives/work that perform various {{tasks such as}} material handling or inspection in hazardous environments, space exploration as well as entertainment or services that involve interaction with humans or objects. Many of these robot designs are driven by servo motors that actuate the joints, i. e. classical two link planar robot manipulator design. Some designs include pulleys, ball screw, gears and other mechanisms. Although these options produces acceptable results for position control, problems such as Coulomb friction, backlash, <b>backdrivability</b> are not negligible. Thus researchers started venturing into direct-drive actuators that eliminate such problems and {{have come up with}} several solutions such as harmonic drive and twin drive di erential gear system. However, these solutions results in relatively low torque/thrust volume densities, i. e large and heavy motors to support large torque/forces. Others propose tubular linear permanent magnet motors as an option for linear/prismatic actuation to replace servo motor coupled with ball screw or other mechanisms. A biarticular manipulator is a musculoskeletal manipulator that consists of links and muscles. For a two-link arm, muscles consist of two pairs of monoarticular muscles (muscles that actuate single joint) and a pair of biarticular muscles (muscles that actuate two joints simultaneously). A pair of muscles means exor and extensor muscles that push or pull arm links. A new manipulator design using direct-drive spiral motors is presented. One spiral motor can represent a pair of exor/extensor muscles thus reducing the number of muscles in the biarticular manipulator from six to only three. This is because the spiral motor is a three-phase Permanent Magnet direct-drive linear actuator that provides high thrust force in forward/reverse direction without any transmission mechanism (gears/belt/pulley). Control of the spiral motor is experimentally validated by simultaneously maintaining rotational angle and gap between stator and rotor (magnetic levitation). Due to the complexity of the closed-link musculoskeletal manipulator and two degree-of-freedom spiral motors, kinematics and dynamics is derived to address spiral motor current inputs and force/torque outputs. Although actuatorlevel control can be easily achieved, workspace control requires kinematic redundancy of the manipulator to be resolved, which is investigated in position and force control in workspace domain. 横浜国立大学, 平成 25 年 3 月 22 日, 博士（工学）, 甲第 1537...|$|E

The high power density of fluid-powered actuators can facilitate design of compact and powerful devices. Pneumatic actuators {{in particular are}} preferred in human interactive devices due to their properties such as inherent compliance, <b>backdrivability</b> and benign consequences of leakage. A drawback of pneumatic actuators is that the current sources of compressed air are bulky and not suitable for mobile human-centered applications. To address these concerns, research is underway on advanced gas based actuation devices such as chemo-fluidic actuators, dry ice actuators, and mini-HCCI engines. These actuators are ideal for development of powerful and mobile devices for human scale applications. The operation of these devices typically requires direct human interaction between the pneumatic (or gas) actuated system and the human operator. Therefore safety of operation is imperative. One way of investigating interaction stability (and hence safe operation) between multiple systems is by using the framework of Passivity analysis from systems theory. The objective of the research presented in this dissertation is investigation of passivity characteristics of pneumatic actuators. This passivity analysis is a preliminary step in understanding the feasibility of using gas based actuators in human interactive applications. Passivity analysis requires definition of a storage function to quantify the effect of inputs and outputs on the system dynamics. The nonlinear dynamics of air compression and expansion in a pneumatic actuator {{are affected by the}} heat transfer across the walls of the actuator. In this thesis, physics based energy functions are developed and defined to be the storage function for three specific models of heat transfer viz adiabatic, isothermal, and finite heat transfer. For reversible thermodynamic process (adiabatic or isothermal), the storage function is defined as the work that can be extracted from the actuator. The storage function for actuator with finite heat transfer is defined as the maximum work that can be extracted from the pneumatic actuator. It is shown that the solution to this optimization problem provides a storage function similar to exergy of the air in the actuator. The supply rate based on these storage functions corresponds to physically meaningful power interaction between different subsystems, such as the actuator and the inertia load. Both adiabatic and isothermal actuators have two ports for power interaction : mechanical port corresponding to interaction with an inertial load, and fluid port corresponding to interaction with source/sink of compressed air. The adiabatic/isothermal actuator behaves as a two-port nonlinear spring with an active flow input at the fluid port of the actuator. Pneumatic actuator with finite heat transfer to the ambient has an additional port corresponding to the thermal interaction with the ambient. The supply rate to the pneumatic actuator with finite heat transfer illustrates that irrespective of chamber air temperature, heat transfer reduces the ability of the actuator to do work, thus contributing to passive behavior of the actuator. Energetically passive controller design for pneumatic actuated human power amplifier and tele-operated human scale devices is presented in this thesis. A framework for controlling the active flow variable at the fluid port of the pneumatic actuator to provide passive operation of a pneumatically actuated human power amplifier is presented by assuming the heat transfer model in the actuator to be either adiabatic or isothermal. This framework is then extended to define the framework for achieving co-ordinated tele-operation of multiple pneumatic actuated devices, while again amplifying input human power. The control problem is suitably defined within the proposed framework and a two-stage back-stepping controller is used to achieve the control objective. The Lyapunov function for the actuator controller design is defined based on the energy functions developed for adiabatic and isothermal actuators. The designed controllers are implemented on single-DOF systems and a multi-DOF robotic rescue crawler with pneumatic actuators. Experimental results confirming the efficacy of the proposed controller are provided. Finally, independent metering of each actuator chamber to improve the operational efficiency of the pneumatic actuators is investigated. In independent metering, two servo valves are used to control the air flow rate to the two chambers of the actuator. The valves are controlled to maintain a low operating pressure in both the chambers, while providing the desired actuator force. This mitigates the losses associated with discharge of high pressure air to atmosphere. Effectiveness of independent metering is evaluated in a single-DOF human power amplifier by assuming the heat transfer model in the actuator to be isothermal. Experimental results show 70...|$|E
