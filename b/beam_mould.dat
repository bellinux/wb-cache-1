" These proceedings are available from: [URL] paper examines the fresh and hardened performance of wet-process sprayed mortars {{and the influence of}} rheology on the pumping and spraying of these mortars. Seven commercially available preblended repair mortars designed for hand application, together with a laboratory-designed fine mortar, were investigated using the Tattersall two-point rotational viscometer, the pressure bleed test, the slump test, and a vane shear strength test. The mortars were pumped and sprayed with a small diameter worm pump and the build thickness determined. Hardened properties measured include compressive strength, tensile bond strength, hardened density and drying shrinkage. Tests were conducted on cast and in-situ specimens and, where possible, on specimens produced by spraying directly into a cube or <b>beam</b> <b>mould.</b> Initial findings for predicting the pumpability and sprayability of the mortars are presented and this is linked together with the hardened performance. These results show that the majority of proprietary pre-blended repair mortars designed for hand application are suitable for wet-process application with a worm pump...|$|E

Seven commercially available pre-packaged repair mortars were pumped and sprayed through a worm pump, three through a piston pump and two through a dry spray machine. A laboratory designed mortar was also worm and piston pumped. The properties measured included compressive and flexural strength, tensile bond strength, hardened density, modulus of elasticity, air permeability, sorptivity and drying and restrained shrinkage. In-situ test specimens were extracted from 500 mmx 500 mmx 100 mm deep sprayed panels. Tests were also conducted on corresponding cast specimens and, where possible, on specimens that had been sprayed directly into a cube or <b>beam</b> <b>mould.</b> A new test to quantify the degree of reinforcement encasement has been developed and an initial investigation into the measurement of the restrained shrinkage of in-situ repairs is presented. The compressive and flexural strengths of the laboratory mix were comparable with the best of the commercially available preblended mortars. The values for modulus of elasticity, when compared with the compressive strength, were lower than published formulas for this relationship would suggest, especially at lower strengths. The air permeability of most of the mortars was lower than that for normal wet-cured concrete and decreased with an increase in compressive strength. The sorptivity values showed no clear relationship with the compressive strength. The type of wet-process pump was found to have little effect on the insitu compressive and flexural strengths, but did affect the bond strength, although mainly due to the stream velocity and w/c ratio rather than the pumping process. The pump type also effected the reinforcement encasement with higher stream velocities producing better encasement. The mixes exhibited a wide range of drying shrinkage, but the data from the restrained specimens suggest an actual repair is influenced as much by ambient conditions as it is by the mix proportions...|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Materials and Structures [© RILEM] and the original publication is available at www. springerlink. com. This paper, which reports on part of a 3 -year research project into wet-process sprayed mortars and concretes for repair, investigates the hardened performance of wet-process sprayed fine concretes. It follows on from an earlier paper by the authors on the performance of hardened wet-process sprayed mortars and some comparisons with these are made here (Austin SA, Robins PJ, Goodier CI (2000). Magz Concr Res 52 : 195 – 208). Work has also been completed by the authors on the pumping and rheology of the fine concrete mixes presented here (Austin SA, Goodier, CI, Robins PJ (2005). Mater Struc, RILEM 38 : 229 – 237). Nine laboratory-designed fine concretes were pumped and sprayed through a wet-process piston pump and one through a dry-process pump. The properties measured included compressive and flexural strength, tensile bond strength, hardened density, elastic modulus, sorptivity and drying and restrained shrinkage. In situ test specimens were extracted from 500 × 500 × 100 mm deep sprayed panels. Hardened property tests were also conducted on corresponding cast specimens and, where possible, on specimens that had been sprayed directly into a cube or <b>beam</b> <b>mould.</b> The compressive strengths of the cast cubes, although very similar, were usually slightly greater than the in␣situ cubes, the opposite of what was found for wet-sprayed mortars (Austin SA, Robins PJ, Goodier CI (2000). Magz Concr Res 52 : 195 – 208). Inconsistent results for compressive and flexural strengths obtained from spraying directly into a steel mould suggest that this method is not as reliable when using a piston pump as it is when using a low-output worm pump (Austin SA, Robins PJ, Goodier CI (2000). Magz Concr Res 52 : 195 – 208). The bond strength of all the mixes exceeded 2. 1 MPa at 7 days. The values for modulus of elasticity, when compared with the compressive strength, were similar to published data for this relationship. The sorptivity values showed only a slight relationship with the compressive strength. The mixes exhibited a wide range of drying shrinkage, but the data from the restrained specimens suggest an actual repair is influenced as much by ambient conditions as it is by the mix proportions...|$|E
