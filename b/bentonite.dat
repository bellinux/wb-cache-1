5|$|All of the localities that Eolambia were {{discovered}} in belong to the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation. Predominant rocks in the Mussentuchit consist of interleaved light gray to gray layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone. Deposits representing two separate river channel systems are also present in the Mussentuchit. The lower of these systems consists of four layers, respectively of muddy sandstone, fine-grained sandstone, silty mudstone, and fine-grained sandstone, with the latter two layers bearing plant debris. The Cifelli #2 Quarry is associated with this system. The upper system consists of greenish fine-grained sandstone. Three layers of <b>bentonite</b> clay layers, representing volcanic ash deposits, are also present in the Mussentuchit, being respectively whitish-gray, yellow, and tan in color. The middle of these layers cuts through the Cifelli #2 Quarry. <b>Bentonite</b> is also present within the sandstone itself throughout the Mussentuchit. In the Cifelli #2 quarry, the bones themselves are blackened, having been replaced by calcite, quartz, pyrite, and carbonate-hydroxyapatite.|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the influence of}} the intrinsic properties of raw materials on the organophilization of <b>bentonites</b> from Argentinean raw sodium <b>bentonites</b> and Brazilian sodium activated <b>bentonites.</b> The organophilization was done with two methodologies: solid-liquid and semisolid reactions. Correlations between the properties of sodium and organophilic <b>bentonites</b> were established. The effectiveness of the treatments was verified by X-ray diffraction, swelling capacity in water and xylene and SEM to evaluate the morphology of the particles. The analysis was done before and after the modification process. The <b>bentonites</b> had organic cations intercalated, as shown by the increase of the basal spacings, and the organophilic character was confirmed because the <b>bentonites</b> showed xylene swelling capacity and particles with an expanded aspect in comparison to those of the sodium <b>bentonites.</b> Both methodologies were efficient to obtain organophilic clays.

No {{significant changes in the}} torque, pressure and viscosity were found for composites prepared with different <b>bentonites.</b> The samples were characterized by XRD and TEM to evaluate the structure and dispersion of the organophilic <b>bentonites.</b> Composites with exfoliated, partially exfoliated and intercalated structures were obtained and correlations between the intrinsic properties of the sodium clays and organophilic <b>bentonites</b> and their influence on the composites were studied. The cation exchange capacity of the sodium <b>bentonites</b> and the swelling capacity of the organophilic <b>bentonites</b> were the most important properties to obtain exfoliated structures in composites. All <b>bentonites</b> showed the potential to obtain polymer nanocomposites, but the ones from Argentina displayed the best results...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cretaceous and Eocene <b>bentonites</b> from Azerbaijan {{have been}} studied from the {{standpoint}} of their occurrence, mode of formation, and mineralogy. The <b>bentonites</b> are shown to be derived from the vitroclastic products of volcanic eruption by transformation i a marine environment. <b>Bentonites</b> are widely used in different fields of industry because they possess unique properties of dispersion and plasticity and because they are able to adsorb, saponify, and bleach. <b>Bentonites</b> have also a great future in agriculture as soil improvers and in the manufacture of fertilizers and pesticides. <b>Bentonites</b> are used on a large scale in the Soviet Union. The predominant industrial deposits are found in Transcaucasus, in Middle Asia, and in the Ukraine. In our geological iterature <b>bentonites</b> are known by a number of local names; for example, gumbrin and askanite in Georgia, gilabi in Azerbaijan, oglanlite and gebelite in Turkmen, kil in Crimea, and nalchikin in the Kabardinian A. S,S. R. Azerbaijan possesses the richest deposits of <b>bentonites</b> in the Soviet Union, the main consumers being the oil and chemical industries. The age of the <b>bentonites</b> or gilabi in Azerbaijan is demonstrated by their occurrence in the Cretaceous ediments of the north-eastern part of the Minor Caucasus, and of the south-eastern slopes of the Major Caucasus, and in the Eocene (koun) deposits of the Apsheron peninsula and the Kobystan-Shemakha regio...|$|R

The application to build the repository was handed in by SKB 2011.|$|E
5|$|At Panxian, {{there appears}} to have been a {{transition}} in the endemic marine reptile fauna, possibly caused by volcanism. This volcanism is indicated by the presence of a <b>bentonite</b> layer between the Middle and Upper Reptile Horizons. From lower in the Upper Reptile Horizon, fossils have also been found of the ubiquitous mixosaurian ichthyosaur Mixosaurus panxianensis (which occurs in all layers), the pachypleurosaurs Keichousaurus sp. and Wumengosaurus delicatomandibularis, and fish, although fossils of the latter are fragmentary. The lower Middle and Lower Reptile Horizons also include the mixosaurian Phalarodon cf. fraasi, the primitive ichthyosaur Xinminosaurus catactes, the placodont Placodus inexpectatus, the nothosaurs Lariosaurus hongguoensis and Nothosaurus yangjuanensis, and the archosaur Qianosuchus mixtus, alongside bivalves and saurichthyid fish.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the mass}} balance principle, mineral {{contents}} of the <b>bentonites</b> from Yangxian of Shaanxi province, Queshan of Henan province, and Chifeng of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were estimated by resolving the Phase Mixing Equation constructed from the data of X-ray diffraction, microprobe analysis of montmorillonite grains, and chemical anaysis of the <b>bentonites.</b> The crystal formulas of montmorillonite in the <b>bentonites</b> were calculated based on the anion hydrogen equivalent method. The cell lattice constants of the principal minerals in the <b>bentonites</b> were calculated with a FORTRAN 90 program CELLSR. When compared with both methods of the methylene blue absorption and XRD Rietveld quantitative phase analysis, the Phase Mixing Equation was confirmed {{to be the most}} effective modal analysis method for determing content of montmorillonite in <b>bentonites</b> with several minerals coexisted...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} surface areas (SSA(N 2 BET)) of 36 different <b>bentonites</b> had larger values for Ca(2 +) /Mg(2 +) <b>bentonites</b> than for Na(+) <b>bentonites.</b> This trend {{could not be}} explained by the different d(001) values nor by the different microstructures. The investigation of Cu-triene-exchanged smectites, which on drying at 105 degrees C still had a d(001) value accounting for approximately 13 A, proved that the SSA(N 2 BET) of low-charged smectites increased more than that of high-charged smectites. This could be explained by: (i) more space between the permanent charge sites in the case of low-charged smectites and (ii) the fact that the layers of Cu-triene smectites do not collapse at 105 degrees C. In contrast the SSA(N 2 BET) of Ca(2 +) -exchanged <b>bentonites</b> could not be related to the layer charge density (LCD) {{as in the case of}} the Cu-triene-exchanged <b>bentonites</b> which is probably due to the varying number of collapsed layers. In conclusion, the SSA(N 2 BET) of <b>bentonites</b> which is known to be largely variable is probably determined by microporosity resulting from the quasi-crystalline overlap region and accessible areas of the interlayer. The number of layers per stack and the microstructure are supposed to play a subordinate role. The larger SSA(N 2 BET) of Ca/Mg <b>bentonites</b> compared to Na <b>bentonites</b> probably can {{be explained by the}} larger space between the charges in the case of the presence of divalent cations...|$|R
30|$|<b>Bentonites</b> {{soaked in}} {{biodiesel}} also called spent earth are a residue produced from biodiesel polishing process. In this step, saturated <b>bentonites</b> with a biodiesel concentration of 20 – 50  % are obtained. The {{oil in the}} <b>bentonites</b> can be treated by chemical extraction; similar to biodiesel production from vegetable oil. Besides that, this residue has been evaluated to produce environmentally friendly, low-cost, and lightweight construction materials. In the work of Eliche-Quesada et al. (2012), glycerin and spent earth were mixed with clay to produce lightweight bricks (Eliche-Quesada et al. 2012).

25|$|When {{productivity}} {{declined in}} the low-clay soils of northern Thailand, farmers initially responded by adding organic matter from termite mounds, but this was unsustainable in the long-term.

In field trials, conducted by scientists from the International Water Management Institute in cooperation with Khon Kaen University and local farmers, this {{had the effect of}} helping retain water and nutrients. Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200kg <b>bentonite</b> per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an average yield increase of 73%. More work showed that applying <b>bentonite</b> to degraded sandy soils reduced the risk of crop failure during drought years.|$|E

40|$|The water {{retention}} behaviour of compacted <b>bentonites</b> is strongly affected by multi-physical and multi-scale processes {{taking place in}} these materials. Experimental data have evidenced major effects of the material dry density, the imposed volume constraints, and the soil fabric. This paper presents a new {{water retention}} model accounting for proper retention mechanisms in each structural level of compacted <b>bentonites,</b> namely adsorption in the intra-aggregate pores and capillarity in the inter-aggregate ones. The model is calibrated and validated against experimental data on different bentonite-based materials, showing good capabilities in capturing the main features of the behaviour. The model is able to reproduce experimental data on compacted <b>bentonites</b> {{over a wide range}} of suction values, within a unified framework, and using a limited number of parameters. Some of the parameters introduced are shown to take approximately the same value for several <b>bentonites,</b> providing a significant basis for preliminary design when dedicated experiments are missing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- High {{swelling}} <b>bentonites</b> {{cannot be}} analyzed for exchangeable cations with {{exactly the same}} technique as most soils. To resolve varied techniques {{used in the past}} and to establish areliable pro-cedure, the effects of sample size, the number of saturations, washes and extractions, and the volume of extracting solutions were determined on three high-swelling <b>bentonites.</b> Small samples must be used to insure complete xtraction of exchangeable cations, and the 0. 5 g weight was the best size of those tested. Most exchangeable cations were removed in three extractions with 25 or 33 ml volumes of ammonium acetate. More extractions could result in excessive solubiliza-tion of minerals. Centrifugal force must be sufficient to prevent loss of sample during decantation. This varied from 4500 to 7500 g for 10 - 20 rain, depending on particle size and sample dispersion. The proposed CEC method requires little time, but still compared closely with Frink's more extensive method and showed no significant difference between treatment means. The procedure was used to analyze high-swelling <b>bentonites</b> from fourteen locations in six Western States. Chemical properties changed within each deposit and with geographical location, but in general the <b>bentonites</b> contained high amounts of exchangeable Na, moderate amounts of exchangeable Ca and Mg, and low amounts of exchangeable K.

The determination f tetrahedral (A 1, Si) and octahedral (A 1, Mg, Fe) composition shows the variable chemistry of these materials. Structural formulae of the illitic clays show that they have tetrahedral charges between 0. 4 and 0. 8 per half unit cell, and can be divided into phengitic types having octahedral charges of 0. 2 - 0. 4 and muscovitic types having octahedral charges < 0. 2. Evaluation of the formulae in the light of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data shows that he occupancy of non-exchangeable interlayer sites (predominantly K) varies from 47 % to 90 % of that of ideal muscovite. In some minerals as muqh as 20 % of these sites is occupied by ammonium ions (determined independently).
