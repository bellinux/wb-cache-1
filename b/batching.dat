40|$|AbstractStream {{processing}} {{is about}} processing continuous streams of data by programs in a workflow. Continuous execution is discretized by grouping input stream tuples into <b>batches</b> and using one <b>batch</b> {{at a time}} for the execution of programs. As source input <b>batches</b> arrive continuously, several <b>batches</b> may be processed in the workflow simultaneously. A general requirement is that each <b>batch</b> be processed completely in the workflow. That is, all the programs triggered by the <b>batch,</b> directly and transitively, in the workflow must be executed successfully. Executing only a prefix of the workflow amounts to dropping (discarding) the <b>batches</b> that were derived by the executed part and {{were supposed to be}} input {{to the rest of the}} workflow. In some cases, such partial executions may not be acceptable and may have to be rolled back, amounting to dropping the source input <b>batches</b> that were processed by the partial execution. We refer to this property of processing the <b>batches</b> either completely or not at all as atomic execution of the <b>batches.</b> We also attribute the property to the <b>batches</b> themselves, calling them atomic <b>batches,</b> meaning that the property applies to the set of transactions that are executed due to that <b>batch.</b> If <b>batches</b> are processed in isolation in the workflow, preserving atomicity is fairly straightforward. When <b>batches</b> are split or merged along the workflow computation, the problem becomes complicated. In this paper, we study issues relating to the atomicity of <b>batches.</b> We illustrate that, in general, preserving atomicity of some <b>batches</b> may affect the atomicity of some other <b>batches,</b> and suggest trade-offs...|$|R

40|$|Scheduling is a {{key factor}} for {{manufacturing}} productivity. Effective scheduling can improve on-time delivery, reduce work-in-process inventory, cut lead time, and improve machine utilization.

30|$|This {{research}} has presented {{an effort to}} optimize scheduling with objective of minimizing lateness and penalty costs in an FMS. To fulfill on time delivery of orders, the suitable <b>batch</b> size strategy selection and execution is significant as <b>batch</b> size directly affects completion time. Different <b>batch</b> sizes yield different completion time and sequence-dependent setup times. Multi-objective Pareto optimization using GA is performed to investigate and compare the results of three <b>batch</b> size strategies: (1) constant <b>batch</b> size of 5 and 10. (2) MPS strategy (3) variable <b>batch</b> size. In first scenario, the <b>batch</b> size of each part is kept 5 and then 10. The larger <b>batch</b> size shows better results. Then, MPS strategy is addressed and results show that setup times are too high for the minimum value of completion time. In the last scenario, variable <b>batch</b> size is used to optimize conflicting objectives. All possible <b>batch</b> sizes of each part are evaluated using the GA and five best results are discussed. The results show that variable <b>batch</b> size strategy exhibits superior results as compared to constant and MPS <b>batch</b> size strategies. This work significantly contributes to an FMS to opt suitable <b>batch</b> size strategy in various demand patterns.|$|R
