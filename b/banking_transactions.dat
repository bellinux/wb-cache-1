As a result, the money trade of western Europe became a specialty of the Jews. But, in almost every instance when Jews acquired large amounts through <b>banking</b> <b>transactions,</b> during their lives or upon their deaths, the king would take it over.

25|$|Estonia's economy {{continues}} to benefit from a transparent government and policies that sustain {{a high level of}} economic freedom, ranking 6th globally and 2nd in Europe. The rule of law remains strongly buttressed and enforced by an independent and efficient judicial system.

The 2017 Ease of Doing Business Index by the World Bank Group places the country 12th in the world, surpassing neighbouring Finland, Australia, Germany, Canada and Switzerland. The strong focus on the IT sector has led to much faster, simpler and efficient public services where for example filing a tax return takes less than five minutes and 98% of <b>banking</b> <b>transactions</b> are conducted through the internet.

As an introduction to extensive data warehousing area we provide some theoretical bases, which include basic terminology, a description of essential elements of data warehouse {{as well as a}} description of development methodology we use.

When designing models, we use literature recommendations for designing heterogeneous products star schemas, transaction star schemas and periodic snapshot star schemas. By using these recommendations, we design dimensional models, which enable transaction accounts business analysis on different grain levels. The next step in the process of making the data mart is carrying out the ETL system, part of the system that is responsible for refreshing the data warehouse. We develop ETL processes, module for automatic execution of the ETL processes, and module for ETL process error handling.
