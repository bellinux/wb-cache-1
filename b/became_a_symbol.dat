5|$|The Apollo {{program also}} {{affected}} environmental activism in the 1970s due to photos {{taken by the}} astronauts. The most famous, taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts, is The Blue Marble. This image, which was released during a surge in environmentalism, <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> of the environmental movement, as a depiction of Earth's frailty, vulnerability, and isolation amid the vast expanse of space.|$|E
5|$|Football is Croatia's {{most popular}} team sport, and the {{national}} team has developed an extensive fan-base since its official formation in 1991. Following Croatia's successful 1998 World Cup campaign, {{three years after the}} Croatian war of independence, there was a rapid rise in domestic and global attention for the national side. English journalist Marcus Tanner of Balkan Insight commented that the national team <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> of Croatian independence from Yugoslavia. However, after the death of former-president Franjo Tuđman, local political ties with the national team have loosened.|$|E

In his own book, Kitchener's Last Volunteer, Allingham {{confirmed}} that he was intending to leave his body to medical science. However he was persuaded by Denis Goodwin to change his mind, as he <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> of World War I to remind people of the sacrifices made during the conflict. To that end he agreed to a funeral and cremation.|$|E
5|$|Schools {{across the}} country were {{dismissed}} early and ordered closed. A photograph of firefighter Chris Fields emerging from the rubble with infant Baylee Almon, who later died in a nearby hospital, was reprinted worldwide and <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> of the attack. The photo, taken by bank employee Charles H. PorterIV, won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography and appeared on newspapers and magazines for months following the attack.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Wolf, {{released}} in 1941, {{was based on}} Jack London's novel. Although the film had a strong cast and production, Rossen's re-draft of the script may be the greatest influence on the film. While the character of Captain Larsen remained both victim and oppressed in a capitalist hierarchy, he <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> of fascism. He split the novel's idealist hero into an intellectual bosun and a rebellious seaman. Warner Bros. cut many political points during production.|$|E

It was split by lightning on July 29, 2011; officials were unsure if the tree would survive. However, after urging by a group raising money to protect the tree, government arborists inspected the tree which was found to be alive and well. The tree was completely felled by strong winds on or around July 22, 2016.|$|E
5|$|After {{his arrest}} Biko {{was held in}} custody in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape for several days, during which he was interrogated. During his {{interrogation}} he was severely beaten {{by some of the}} policemen questioning him. He suffered severe injuries, including his brain, and died soon after on 12 September 1977. News of his death spread quickly, and <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> of the abuses perpetrated under the apartheid government. Biko's position as an individual who had never been convicted of a crime led to the death being reported in the international press; he thus became one of first anti-apartheid activists widely known internationally.|$|E
5|$|In his old age, he <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> for the Buffalo Soldiers. In 1994, he {{met with}} President Bill Clinton at the White House. In 1997, {{at the age of}} 103, Matthews was present at Arlington National Cemetery for a service honoring the Buffalo Soldiers, where he {{unveiled}} a plaque that dedicated his former barracks in honor of the soldiers. For his 108th birthday in 2002, {{he met with}} then-United States Secretary of State Colin Powell, where Powell was presented with a portrait of Matthews. He was a member of his local church, a Prince Hall Masonic Temple and the Washington chapter of the 9th and 10th Cavalry Association until his death.|$|E

5|$|The CNSA {{became a}} major part of {{everyday}} life and culture in occupied Belgium. The organization fulfilled much of the day-to-day running of a welfare system and generally prevented famine, although food and material shortages were extremely common throughout the occupation. At its height, the CNSA had more than 125,000 agents and distributors across the country. Historians have described the CNSA itself, with its central committee and local networks across the country, as paralleling the actions of the official Belgian government in peacetime. In the eyes of contemporaries, the CNSA <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> of national unity and of passive resistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} well-supplied with foodstuffs, ammunition, and coal, {{and the only}} demand of mutineers—led by João Cândido Felisberto—was the {{abolition}} of what they called slavery: they objected to low pay, long hours, inadequate training, and punishments including bolo (being struck on the hand with a ferrule) {{and the use of}} whips or lashes (chibata), which eventually <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> of the revolt. By the 23rd, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general amnesty for the sailors. Senator Ruy Barbosa, long an opponent of slavery, lent a large amount of support, and the measure unanimously passed the Federal Senate on 24 November. The measure was then sent to the Chamber of Deputies.|$|E
5|$|The tiger {{is one of}} {{the animals}} {{displayed}} on the Pashupati seal of the Indus Valley Civilisation. The tiger was the emblem of the Chola Dynasty and was depicted on coins, seals and banners. The seals of several Chola copper coins show the tiger, the Pandyan emblem fish and the Chera emblem bow, indicating that the Cholas had achieved political supremacy over the latter two dynasties. Gold coins found in Kavilayadavalli in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh have motifs of the tiger, bow and some indistinct marks. The tiger symbol of Chola Empire was later adopted by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the tiger <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> of the unrecognised state of Tamil Eelam and Tamil independence movement.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the varied}} and even {{contradictory}} {{interpretations of the}} colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous. In English folklore and literature, green was traditionally used to symbolise nature and its associated attributes: fertility and rebirth. Stories of the medieval period also used it to allude to love and the base desires of man. Because of its connection with faeries and spirits in early English folklore, green also signified witchcraft, devilry and evil. It can also represent decay and toxicity. When combined with gold, as with the Green Knight and the girdle, green was often seen as representing youth's passing. In Celtic mythology, green was associated with misfortune and death, and therefore avoided in clothing. The green girdle, originally worn for protection, <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> of shame and cowardice; it is finally adopted {{as a symbol of}} honour by the knights of Camelot, signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; this displays both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour green.|$|E
5|$|After the Huế Phật Đản shootings on May 8, {{civil unrest}} {{broke out in}} South Vietnam. Nine Buddhists were shot by the Roman Catholic regime of President Ngô Đình Diệm after defying a {{government}} ban on the flying of Buddhist flags on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha and marching in an anti-government protest. Following the shootings, Buddhist leaders began to lobby Diệm for religious equality and compensation and justice {{for the families of}} the victims. With Diệm remaining recalcitrant, the protests escalated. The self-immolation of Buddhist monk Thích Quảng Đức at a busy Saigon intersection became a public relations disaster for the Diệm regime, as photos of the event made front-page headlines worldwide and <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> of Diệm's policies. As protests continued, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Special Forces loyal to Diệm's brother Ngô Đình Nhu conducted the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids on August 21, leaving a death toll estimated to be up to several hundred and causing extensive damage under the declaration of martial law. Universities and high schools were closed amid mass pro-Buddhist protests. In the meantime, the fight against the Viet Cong insurgency had begun to lose intensity amid rumours of sectarian infighting amongst ARVN troops. This was compounded by the plotting of a coup by various ARVN officers, which distracted attention from the insurgency. After the pagoda raids, the Kennedy administration sent Cable 243 to the US Embassy, Saigon, ordering an exploration of alternative leadership possibilities.|$|E
5|$|Free agent pitcher Mike Mussina {{signed with}} the Yankees before their 2001 season began, and the club {{pulled away from the}} Red Sox as the year progressed to claim another divisional championship, as Clemens won 20 games. The September 11 attacks {{interrupted}} the season, and the resumption of baseball in New York <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> of how the city recovered from the destruction of the Twin Towers. After falling behind 2–0 in the ALDS against the Athletics, the Yankees won three straight contests to advance to the ALCS. They prevailed in five games against the Seattle Mariners, who had tied a single-season MLB record with 116 regular season wins, for the team's fourth straight AL pennant. The Arizona Diamondbacks gained a two-game lead in the 2001 World Series before the Yankees won three consecutive ballgames; New York home runs with two outs in the ninth inning of Games 4 and 5 led to extra inning wins in both games, with Game 4 ended by a Jeter home run. The Yankees' championship streak ended, though, as the Diamondbacks won the Series in seven games with a late rally in the final inning of Game 7.|$|E

5|$|The 2003 tournament {{became an}} {{exceptional}} show as many teams such as América de Cali, River Plate, Grêmio, Cobreloa, and Racing, among others, brought their best sides in generations and unexpected teams such as Independiente Medellín and Paysandu became revelations in what was, arguably, the best Copa Libertadores in history. The biggest {{news of the}} competition was previous champion Santos. Qualifying to the tournament as Brazilian champion, coached by Emerson Leão and containing marvelous figures such as Renato, Alex, Léo, Ricardo Oliveira, Diego, Robinho, and Elano, the Santásticos <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> of entertaining and cheerful football that resembled Pelé's generation of the 1960s. Boca Juniors once again found talent in their ranks {{to fill the gap}} left by the very successful group of 2000–2001 (with upcoming stars Rolando Schiavi, Roberto Abbondanzieri and Carlos Tevez). Boca Juniors and Santos would eventually meet in a rematch of the 1963 final; Boca avenged the 1963 loss by defeating Santos in both legs of the final. Carlos Bianchi won the Cup for a fourth time and became the most successful manager in the competition's history and Boca Juniors hailed themselves pentacampeones. Boca reached their fourth final in five tournaments in 2004 but were beaten by surprise-outfit Once Caldas of Colombia, ending Boca's dream generation. Once Caldas, employing a conservative and defensive style of football, became the second Colombian side to win the competition.|$|E
