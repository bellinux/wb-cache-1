40|$|A 1 / 12 scale {{tank was}} {{constructed}} to physically simulate the metallurgical skimming process {{in order to}} gain a better insight of the skimming of fluid slag from copper anode furnaces. 1 -decanol and water were used to represent the slag and the underlying liquid metal respectively. It was observed that slag skimming was comprised of two steps, a transportation step to carry slag to the skimming lip, and a removal step to move the slag across the lip. The efficiency of the transportation by bath surface circulation was strongly affected by the method of creation of the surface movement. Submerged gas injection failed to carry slag to the lip effectively because of the uncontrollable circulation pattern generated on the bath surface. On the other hand, three impinging gas jets in glancing contact with the bath surface were able to carry slag to the lip effectively. The Re of the jets (I. D. 0. 01 m) inclined 50 ° to the horizontal was 6100. The jet configuration was two of the jets were placed close and parallel to the rear wall of the model and faced each other. The third jet was parallel to the model short axis and was directed at the skimming mouth. With the same amount of time, 70 % of the slag originally charged to the tank was skimmed with the assistance from the impinging gas jets in comparison to 20 % when no jet was used. Detailed analysis of the skimming process revealed that the underlying liquid <b>bath</b> <b>level</b> continuously decreased as the slag was skimmed and resulted in continuous reduction of the skimming rate.

Furthermore, the existing cold syngas cleaning technology also requires that the syngas temperature to be reduced below 600 oF. Direct water quenching of syngas is one of the cooling schemes that can not only provide the necessary cooling, but also help to drive the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction to convert steam and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and hydrogen, which is an important process for systems implementing carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). To assist designing an adequate syngas quench cooling section, this study has employed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate the performance of a preliminary design of a water quench system in a downdraft entrained flow coal gasifier. The preliminary quench system design consists of a primary water curtain section located in the main entrance of the quench section and a secondary water spray section distributed in the outer annular passage with a counter-flow arrangement.

Thermocouple data from an operating furnace have been used throughout the work, to verify results and to develop methodologies to use the results in further studies. The hearth lining {{were divided into two}} zones based on the thermocouple readings: a region with regular temperature variations due to the tapping of the furnace, and another region with slow temperature variations. In an experimental study, the temperatures of the outer surfaces of the wall and bottom were measured and compared with lining temperature measured by thermocouples. Expressions to describe the outer surface temperature profiles were derived and used as input in a two-dimensional steady state heat transfer model. The {{aim of the}} study was to predict the lining temperature profiles in the region subjected to slow temperature variations. The methodology to calculate a steady state lining temperature profile was used as input to a three-dimensional model. The aim of the three-dimensional model was primarily to study the region with dynamic lining temperature variations caused by regular tappings. The study revealed that the replacement of original lining with tap clay has an effect when simulating the quasi-stationary temperature variations in the lining. The study initiated a more detailed study of the taphole region and the size and shape of the tap clay layer profile. It was concluded, that in order to make a more accurate heat transfer model of the blast furnace hearth, the presence of a skull build-up below the taphole, erosion above the taphole and the <b>bath</b> <b>level</b> variations must to be taken into consideration.

In the weak-field limit, the ERE-CARS signal scales inversely with the square of the dephasing rates for the electronic and Raman coherences. In accord with published experimental observations [Roy et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 89, 104105 (2006) ], the ERE-CARS signal is shown to be insensitive to the collisional quenching rate.

Using schemes, such as the variational cluster approximation (VCA) and the cluster dynamical mean field theory (CDMFT) in combination with exact diagonalization (ED), they argued that a single bath orbital per site of the six-atom unit cell is insufficient and leads to the erroneous conclusion that the system is gapped for all nonzero values of the onsite Coulomb interaction U. In contrast, we point out here that, {{in the case of the}} honeycomb lattice, six <b>bath</b> <b>levels</b> per six-site unit cell are perfectly adequate for the description of short-range correlations. Instead, we demonstrate that it is the violation of long-range translation symmetry inherent in CDMFT-like schemes which opens a gap at Dirac points. The gap found at small U therefore does not correspond to a Mott gap. As a result, present CDMFT schemes are not suitable for the identification of a spin-liquid phase on the honeycomb lattice.

40|$|The two-band Hubbard model {{involving}} subbands {{of different}} widths is investigated via finite-temperature exact diagonalization (ED) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). In {{contrast to the}} quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method which at low temperatures includes only Ising-like exchange interactions to avoid sign problems, ED permits a treatment of Hund's exchange and other onsite Coulomb interactions on the same footing. The role of finite-size effects caused by {{the limited number of}} <b>bath</b> <b>levels</b> in this scheme is studied by analyzing the low-frequency behavior of the subband self-energies as a function of temperature, and by comparing with numerical renormalization group (NRG) results for a simplified effective model. For half-filled, non-hybridizing bands, the metallic and insulating phases are separated by an intermediate mixed phase with an insulating narrow and a bad-metallic wide subband. The wide band in this phase exhibits different degrees of non-Fermi-liquid behavior, depending on the treatment of exchange interactions. Whereas for complete Hund's coupling, infinite lifetime is found at the Fermi level, in the absence of spin-flip and pair-exchange, this lifetime becomes finite. Excellent agreement is obtained both with new NRG and previous QMC/DMFT calculations. These results suggest that-finite temperature ED/DMFT might be a useful scheme for realistic multi-band materials...|$|R

40|$|To {{distinguish}} {{the effects of}} theophylline on respiratory muscle contractility from alterations in respiratory muscle interaction or blood flow, we examined in vitro contractile properties and fatigue of canine diaphragm in two series of experiments. In the first series, a 40 -mg/kg aminophylline infusion was given to dogs, and diaphragm strips were removed for in vitro study when stable tissue fixation of the drug was reached. Compared with control bundles examined before aminophylline infusion, no alterations in twitch tension, tetanic tension, or force-frequency characteristics were observed. Moreover, theophylline-treated strips fatigued faster than control strips, whether subjected to repetitive submaximal or maximal contractions (p < 0. 01). In the second series, diaphragm bundles were equilibrated with high theophylline doses (400 mg/L) in vitro, and inotropic effects compared with the results in the first series. Supratherapeutic theophylline concentrations increased force development at low stimulation frequencies (p < 0. 05 at 10 Hz) and significantly elevated twitch-tetanus ratio (p < 0. 01) but did not protect against development of in vitro muscle fatigue. Poor penetration of theophylline in diaphragm bundles in vitro was excluded, since drug concentrations in the muscle bundle and the muscle bath were virtually equal. We conclude that diaphragmatic tissue concentrations correlate well with therapeutic serum and supratherapeutic <b>bath</b> <b>levels</b> and that only high theophylline concentrations increase canine diaphragmatic contractility in vitro.

EQergy absorbed from a laser pulse is rapidly distributed throughout this bath) e~tablishing a new vibrational popula-~- ~ tion distribution characteristic of the higher vibrational temperature [...] The vibrational equilibrium is readily maintained at high SF 6 pressures. It;s demonstrated that in this case the model successfully predicts the. tran~mission and · pulse shaplng of high power CO 2 laser pulses. In particular, the rapid decrease in absorption at high incide~...|$|R
