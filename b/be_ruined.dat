5|$|During post-production, Vasan asked Ramnoth {{his opinion}} of the scene when {{hundreds}} of Veerasimhan's warriors storm the palace to rescue Chandralekha from Sasankan. Although the scene's photography, shots and action had been unanimously praised by others, Ramnoth was quiet before saying that the suspense might <b>be</b> <b>ruined</b> if the scene was shown uncut. This sparked a discussion; Vasan advised Chandru to edit in accordance with Ramnoth's direction, and {{was impressed with the}} result. C. E. Biggs was the film's audio engineer.|$|E

Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) love {{triangle}} with Avery Jessup (Banks) and Nancy Donovan (Moore) comes to a head. At the same time, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) tries to avoid a promotion that would send him to Los Angeles, and Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) new relationship may <b>be</b> <b>ruined</b> after her boyfriend (Forte) falls for another woman.|$|E
5|$|Farmers rely on weather {{forecasts}} {{to decide}} what work to do on any particular day. For example, drying hay is only feasible in dry weather. Prolonged periods of dryness can ruin cotton, wheat, and corn crops. While corn crops can <b>be</b> <b>ruined</b> by drought, their dried remains {{can be used as}} a cattle feed substitute in the form of silage. Frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall. For example, peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze. Orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes, regardless of their timing.|$|E

5|$|During the hearing, Hurcomb {{pointed out}} a letter {{published}} in The Times in July 1944, in which the Bishop and Dean of Durham, and Warden of the Durham Colleges, had given the misleading impression that the proposed station would ruin views from the railway line, an idea compounded by the publication {{a few days later}} of a photograph taken from the proposed site. He acknowledged that a number of views from parts of the river would <b>be</b> <b>ruined,</b> and that the station would be visible from the Cathedral and church, Hurcomb emphasised {{that the majority of the}} beautiful views around the city would remain. Pepler also found that from the railway station, the power station and the Cathedral could not be viewed simultaneously. The members of the inquiry initially concluded that the station should be given the go-ahead, based on the grounds that a more suitable site could not be decided upon.|$|E
5|$|Momolo {{returned}} to Bologna in late September 1858 after his two brothers-in-law wrote {{to him that}} if he stayed in Rome any longer the family might <b>be</b> <b>ruined.</b> He left Scazzocchio to represent the family's cause in Rome. Momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine Morisi's credibility, either by disproving aspects of her story or by showing her to be untrustworthy. He also resolved to confront Cesare Lepori, the grocer who Morisi said had both suggested the baptism and shown her how to perform it. Based on Morisi's story, Lepori had already been identified by many observers as being ultimately to blame for the affair. When Momolo visited his shop in early October, Lepori vehemently denied that he had ever spoken to Morisi about Edgardo or any baptism, and said that he was prepared to testify to this effect before any legal authority. He claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism, so had such a conversation occurred it could hardly have gone as Morisi described.|$|E

25|$|Removing and {{destroying}} galls before they dry and the wasps {{emerge from a}} hole may help to reduce the infestation. While fairly large, spectacular, and sometimes present in quite large numbers, they cause no measurable harm. The galls were the subject of considerable press controversy {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} when it was thought that the acorn crop would <b>be</b> <b>ruined</b> and its rapid spread would deprive farmers of valuable pannage (fodder) for their pigs.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of the Corn Laws had been to keep the price of home-grown grain up. Duties on imported grain assured English farmers a minimum and profitable price. The burden of a higher price for bread was carried by the labouring classes, in particular factory workers and operatives. It was claimed that if the Corn Laws were repealed all those connected with the land would <b>be</b> <b>ruined</b> and the established social organisation of the country destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Commercially used {{creosote}} {{is often}} treated {{to extract the}} carbolic acid, naphthalene, or anthracene content. The carbolic acid or naphthalene is generally extracted {{to be used in}} other commercial products. American produced creosote oils typically will have low amounts of anthracene and high amounts of naphthalene, because when forcing the distillate at a temperature that produces anthracene the soft pitch will <b>be</b> <b>ruined</b> and only the hard pitch will remain; this ruins it for use in roofing purposes, and only leaves a product which isn't commercially useful.|$|E
25|$|Hancock's II Corps began pushing {{south from}} Chesterfield Bridge {{at about the}} same time that Ledlie was {{initially}} crossing the river. Hancock ordered Gibbon's division to advance down the railroad. After pushing aside Confederate skirmishers they ran into earthworks manned by the Alabama brigade of Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law and the North Carolina brigade of Col. William R. Cox. Gibbon's lead brigade under Col. Thomas A. Smyth attacked the earthworks, but the Confederates counterattacked, and soon most of Gibbon's division was engaged. The fierce fighting was briefly interrupted by the thunderstorm as men on both sides paused with concern that their gunpowder would <b>be</b> <b>ruined.</b> As the rain diminished, Maj. Gen. David B. Birney's division came to Gibbon's support, but even the combined force could not break the Confederate line.|$|E
25|$|Minchin {{embarked}} on a new arena tour starting with Birmingham on Wednesday 8 December 2010. A departure from the structure of his previous live shows, his act was scaled up to be performed with the Heritage Orchestra. It contained a mixture of material, including new songs {{on the subject of}} prayer and of rationality (themes which often appear in his previous work). Minchin stated that the aim of incorporating the orchestra into his act was to create a comedy show that would not <b>be</b> <b>ruined</b> by being performed in arenas, as stated in the special features of the DVD and Blu-ray. The show toured the UK and Australia, and was filmed at the Royal Albert Hall in London for a Blu-ray and DVD that was released in November 2011.|$|E

25|$|On 27 August 1803, Durutte {{received}} {{promotion to}} general of division {{in spite of}} Napoleon Bonaparte's dislike of officers from Moreau's army. He {{became a member of}} the Légion d'Honneur on 11 December 1803 and a commander of the Légion on 9 June 1804. His former relationship with Moreau, who was exiled from France, then caused trouble. When asked to put his signature on a document agreeing with Napoleon's appointment as emperor of France, Durutte remained true to his republican beliefs and refused to sign. When his officers also offered to join him in defiance, he dissuaded them so their careers would not <b>be</b> <b>ruined.</b> After this incident, apparently no one wanted to have anything to do with him except Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout, who gave him command of the island of Elba. He remained in this isolated post for three years.|$|E
25|$|In May 2002, Ricky meets up with Bianca in Manchester {{and they}} briefly rekindle their romance after he gets {{her out of}} trouble with her boss Vince.

Bianca decides to leave Liam with Ricky and hitches a ride to a destination unknown. Ricky returns to Walford in August 2002 with Liam after hearing from his former stepmother Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement), that his sister Janine (Charlie Brooks) has resorted to prostitution and drug-use. Ricky remains to help Janine and returns to his old job as a mechanic at the Arches. He begins a second affair with Natalie, ending her marriage to Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson), whose father Roy is now married to Pat. Roy then dies {{after a heart attack}} after the affair is uncovered and he discovers that Pat had known about the affair but had failed to inform Barry and Roy.|$|E
25|$|Farms were in disrepair, and the prewar {{stock of}} horses, mules and cattle was much depleted; two-fifths, or 40%, of the South's {{livestock}} had been killed. The South's farms were not highly mechanized, but {{the value of}} farm implements and machinery in the 1860 Census was $81 million and was reduced by two-fifths, or 40%, by 1870. The transportation infrastructure lay in ruins, with little railroad or riverboat service available to move crops and animals to market. Railroad mileage was located mostly in rural areas and over two-thirds of the South's rails, bridges, rail yards, repair shops and rolling stock were in areas reached by Union armies, which systematically destroyed what they could. Even in untouched areas, the lack of maintenance and repair, the absence of new equipment, the heavy over-use, and the deliberate relocation of equipment by the Confederates from remote areas to the war zone ensured the system would <b>be</b> <b>ruined</b> at war's end. Restoring the infrastructure—especially the railroad system—became {{a high priority for}} Reconstruction state governments.|$|E

25|$|That night, Karl and Harry have a {{confrontation}} backstage, in which Karl accuses Harry of murdering Carol; Harry angrily rejects the accusation and challenges that Karl merely finds {{it easier to}} believe that rather than accept the guilt of betraying his best friend. On stage, Karl begins to pioneer his psychic act, but the stooge he has hired in the crowd which he had chosen with a fake random ball toss, accidentally trips and concusses himself on the stage. Upon hearing the sad story of another selected audience member, he decides that he cannot perpetuate the fraud, admitting to the audience {{that he is not}} able to contact the dead. As a result, Dani forgives him. Harry, as 'The Black Widower', starts his guillotine act, but at the moment of truth Linda's nerve fails her and she flees the stage. Although Harry’s act would appear to <b>be</b> <b>ruined</b> when he asks if anybody else wants to try, Karl steps forward and announces that he will face the guillotine instead. Karl allows himself to be locked in the guillotine, explaining that Carol was frequently unfaithful and forced Karl to have sex with her. Harry appears to decapitate Karl – although it is merely an illusion, and Karl appears unharmed, the trick having worked perfectly. Harry wins the competition, and in his acceptance speech both forgives Karl and admits that he loves Linda, who joins him on stage and the two kiss. Their friendship mended, Karl and Harry embark on a reunion tour, incorporating Dani and Linda into the act as their assistants.|$|E

Cao's Mongol troops were veterans who had fought in several campaigns under the eunuch Cao Jixiang (曹吉祥)—Cao Qin's adoptive father—in the 1440s. The loyalty of Cao's Mongol-officer clients was secure due to circumstances of thousands of military officers who had to accept demotions in 1457 because of earlier promotions in aiding Jingtai's succession.

500|$|From {{the sixth}} century {{to the end of}} the 19th century, historians had {{recognized}} that the Historia Augusta was a flawed and not a particularly reliable source, and since the 20th century modern scholars have tended to treat it with extreme caution. Older historians, such as Edward Gibbon, not fully aware of its problems with respect to the fictitious elements contained within it, generally treated the information preserved within it as authentic. For instance, in Gibbon's account of the reign of Gallienus, he uncritically reproduces the Historia Augusta's biased and largely fictional account of that reign. So when Gibbon states [...] "The repeated intelligence of invasions, defeats, and rebellions, he received with a careless smile; and singling out, with affected contempt, some particular production of the lost province, he carelessly asked, whether Rome must <b>be</b> <b>ruined,</b> unless it was supplied with linen from Egypt, and arras cloth from Gaul", he is reworking the passage in The Two Gallieni: ...|$|E
