To satisfy our schedule of conditions, supply mode permits to limit electromagnetic perturbation level. At rated speed, motor characeristics are defined so as to have only one current pulse per period and per phase produced by square full wave voltage. To optimize rated operation of motor-converetr, we propose an analytical method based on a linearized model. The principal parameter is airgap length. We describe briefly the choice method of other dimensions for rotor and stator. The main constraint of the design is a copper losses limit imposed by thermal considerations.

40|$|In a {{high-speed}} {{signal transmission system}} that uses transformer coupling, {{there is a need}} to provide increased transmitted signal strength without adding active components. This invention uses additional transformers to achieve the needed gain. The prior art uses stronger drivers (which require an IC redesign and a higher power supply voltage), or the addition of another active component (which can decrease reliability, increase power consumption, reduce the beneficial effect of serializer/deserializer preemphasis or deemphasis, and/or interfere with fault containment mechanisms), or uses a different transformer winding ratio (which requires redesign of the transformer and may not be feasible with high-speed signals that require a 1 : 1 winding ratio). This invention achieves the required gain by connecting the secondaries of multiple transformers in series. The primaries of these transformers are currently either connected in parallel or are connected to multiple drivers. There is also a need to split a receive signal to multiple destinations with minimal signal loss. Additional transformers can achieve the split. The prior art uses impedance-matching series resistors that cause a loss of signal. Instead of causing a loss, most instantiations of this invention would actually provide gain. Multiple transformers are used instead of multiple windings on a single transformer because multiple windings on the same transformer would require a redesign of the transformer, and may not be feasible with high-speed transformers that usually require a <b>bifilar</b> <b>winding</b> with a 1 : 1 ratio. This invention creates the split by connecting the primaries of multiple transformers in series. The secondary of each transformer is connected to one of the intended destinations without the use of impedance-matching series resistors...|$|E
3000|$|... n-type GaSb {{whiskers}} doped with Te {{were selected}} for the study. The whiskers were grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method in a closed system [15]. The whisker’s diameter ranges from 15 to 20  μm with length from 4 to 5  mm. Current electrical contacts were created by welding Pt whiskers on the {{opposite ends of the}} studied whiskers. The distance between potentiometric contacts was equidistant and equal to 1  mm. The method provides resistive contact to the samples in the temperature range 4.2 – 300  K. As a result, linear I-V curves were obtained. Te is commonly used as n-type dopant in GaSb for creating the photovoltaic devices. The results of doped whiskers investigation by ion mass spectroscopy have shown that n-GaSb whiskers (ρ 300 K[*]=[*] 0.004  Ω cm) have Te concentration corresponding to the metallic side of metal-insulator transition and it is equal to 1.7 [*]×[*] 1018  cm− 3.
