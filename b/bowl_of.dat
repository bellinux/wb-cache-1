5|$|After the show, WWE {{was criticized}} for a {{malfunction}} in the pyrotechnics during The Undertaker's victory celebration. During the celebration, a hot cable for pyrotechnics was sent flying into audience members in the upper seating <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> the stadium, leaving 45 injured, with some hospitalized. The accident was apparently due to a cable which fireworks were traveling across snapping, thus resulting in the fireworks exploding into the top rows of the upper <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> the stadium. WWE's corporate website released a statement afterward stating that they would investigate the incident, but {{the results of the}} investigation were never released.|$|E

5|$|Tabbouleh is a Mediterranean-style table salad {{originating}} in the Levant. The salad is made from parsley pieces, bulgur, diced tomatoes, cucumbers and is sautéed with lemon juice and vinegar. In 2006, the largest <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> tabbouleh {{in the world was}} prepared by Palestinian cooks in the West Bank city of Ramallah.|$|E
5|$|As {{a sophomore}} for the 2011 team, Mark {{switched}} from wide receiver to running {{back during the}} season. However, during the game against Michigan, he also played linebacker in order to shadow Denard Robinson. The season ended at the 2011 Meineke Car Care <b>Bowl</b> <b>of</b> Texas against Texas A. In the game, Mark recorded 7 kickoff returns for 141 yards. This gave him Northwestern record-setting single-season totals of 40 returns and 915 return yards, surpassing records both set by Jim Pooler in 1974 (38 for 807). Mark also scored his first rushing touchdown in the game.|$|E

5|$|The area {{also has}} many {{opportunities}} for both alpine and Nordic skiing. The <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> Tuckerman Ravine {{is famous for its}} extremely steep backcountry skiing. Long lines are common during the peak spring-skiing season of April and May. Wildcat Mountain offers groomed ski trails and lifts, and is a better choice for less-experienced skiers. The centerpiece of the ski-area is the gondola, which runs during the summer, and offers views of the Presidentials with no expended effort.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{attracting}} American fans through television {{has long been}} a goal of the CFL although the results have been intermittent. As early as 1954, the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (forerunner of the CFL's East Division) struck a deal with NBC that lasted a year and featured 13 games. The infamous Fog <b>Bowl</b> <b>of</b> 1962 was—at least until play was suspended—broadcast by ABC. Over subsequent years various non-major networks picked up an assortment of games.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> the 2012-13 College Football Bowl season. Prior to 2012, the teams had not met since 1941 despite their close proximity. In 1941, Arizona beat Nevada 26–7. Overall, the series record prior to the game was 1–1–1. Arizona, who had {{appeared}} in a bowl game {{in four of the}} previous five seasons, made the Pac-12's first appearance in the New Mexico Bowl. Nevada made its eighth consecutive bowl appearance and second all-time in the New Mexico Bowl.|$|E

5|$|A <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> living larvae {{is served}} at the meal, to Picard's disgust. He {{attempts}} to leave, only to find Riker blocking his way. The commander appears {{to be controlled by}} the parasite Quinn brought to the Enterprise. When the others see a prosthetic protrusion on the back of Riker's neck, he is accepted as one of them and allowed to dine. They reveal that the parasites are seeking to take over Starfleet, using humanoids as hosts. When he is about to put a handful of the larvae in his mouth, Riker suddenly produces a phaser and fires on one of the Admirals. Picard picks up a fallen weapon and the two Enterprise officers subdue the infected, causing parasites to leave the hosts and flee. One of the parasites scurries under a closed door and Picard and Riker follow it. They find Remmick ingesting the parasite to join several others inside him. Picard and Riker fire upon Remmick, destroying his body but freeing a giant parasite; the two continue to fire until it is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother {{who has spent}} many an hour {{hovering}} over my son with a thermometer and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't {{want to go out}} for dinner with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew in the care of their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, the women's rights {{movement}} won {{passage of a}} constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage. The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television. The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and {{the onset of the}} Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, which included the establishment of the Social Security system. The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended through the 1960s; whereas the Dust <b>Bowl</b> <b>of</b> the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Maryland won {{its first}} four games and entered the AP Poll {{for the first time}} since September 1995. Maryland beat 15th-ranked Georgia Tech in {{overtime}} when placekicker Nick Novak, the ACC's future all-time scoring leader, equalized and then won the game with 46- and 26-yard field goals, thereby ensuring a winning season and bowl appearance. In Tallahassee, 18th-ranked Florida State broke a stalemate in the fourth quarter to hand Maryland its only defeat of the regular season, 52–31. Maryland closed the year with a win over NC State, which secured the ACC championship and made the Terrapins the first team other than Florida State to take the title outright since the Seminoles joined the conference in 1991. Sixth-ranked Maryland then faced fifth-ranked Florida in the Orange Bowl—their first-ever BCS appearance, and their first major <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> any sort since the 1977 Cotton Bowl. The Terrapins lost, 56–23, and finished with a 10–2 record and ranked 10th in the nation.|$|E
5|$|Miceli {{entered the}} monster truck {{business}} under Dennis Anderson in 1999. She made her first American hot rod {{appearance at the}} Trans World Dome. Afterward, she purchased her own truck and named it Madusa, as she still held {{the rights to the}} name. She began winning freestyle competitions in 2001. Miceli won the 2004 co-championship at the Monster Jam World Finals for freestyle in the first-ever three-way tie. In March 2005 in Las Vegas, she beat her trainer Dennis Anderson in the final bracket of the Monster Jam World Finals for the Racing Championship, thus making her the first woman to win the Monster Jam World Finals racing championship. Also in 2005, she was the only female competitor in the Super <b>Bowl</b> <b>of</b> Motorsports.|$|E
5|$|On either 10 or 11 June 323BC, Alexander died in {{the palace}} of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32. There are two {{different}} versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus, and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa. He developed a fever, which worsened until {{he was unable to}} speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them. In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> unmixed wine in honour of Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony. Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.|$|E

50|$|Bale was a {{professional}} lower-order left-handed batsman and a slow-medium left-arm bowler: reports in consecutive editions of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in the mid-1920s indicate that he {{was seen as a}} contrast to the spin <b>bowling</b> <b>of</b> Ewart Astill and the fast-medium <b>bowling</b> <b>of</b> George Geary, and to Leicestershire's other right-handed bowlers, and not as a spin bowler himself.|$|R

5|$|Sindhu {{was given}} the ever-full <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> amrita (elixir of life) as a boon from the Sun-god. The demon was warned that he could drink from the bowl {{as long as it}} was intact. So to protect the bowl, he {{swallowed}} it. Sindhu terrorized the three worlds, so the gods asked Gunesha for help. Gunesha defeated Sindhu's army, cut his general Kamalasura into three pieces and then cut open Sindhu's body, emptying the amrita bowl and thus killing the demon. The creator-god Brahma is described as having built the Morgaon shrine, and marrying Siddhi and Buddhi to Ganesha. At the end of this incarnation, Gunesha returned to his celestial abode, giving his peacock mount to his younger brother Skanda, with whom the peacock mount is generally associated.|$|E
5|$|Some {{distinctive}} {{characteristics in}} Garamond's letterforms are an 'e' {{with a small}} eye and the <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> the 'a' which has a sharp hook upwards at top left. Other general features are limited but clear stroke contrast and capital letters {{on the model of}} Roman square capitals. The 'M' is slightly splayed with outward-facing serifs at the top (sometimes only on the left) and the leg of the 'R' extends outwards from the letter. The x-height (height of lower-case letters) is low, especially at larger sizes, making the capitals large relative to the lower case, while the top serifs on the ascenders of letters like 'd' have a downward slope and ride above the cap height. The axis of letters like the ‘o’ is diagonal and the bottom right of the italic 'h' bends inwards.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese of the Song dynasty were adept sailors who {{traveled}} to {{ports of call}} {{as far away as}} Fatimid Egypt. They were well equipped for their journeys abroad, in large seagoing vessels steered by stern-post rudders and guided by the directional compass. Even before Shen Kuo and Zhu Yu had described the mariner's magnetic needle compass, the earlier military treatise of the Wujing Zongyao in 1044 had also described a thermoremanence compass. This was a simple iron or steel needle that was heated, cooled, and placed in a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> water, producing the effect of weak magnetization, although its use was described only for navigation on land and not at sea.|$|E
