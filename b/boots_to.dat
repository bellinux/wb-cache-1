5|$|Omaha had terrible streets {{through the}} late 1880s, which caused many {{residents}} to believe the city was not progressing appropriately. This lack of responsiveness by the city government was caused by property owners throughout the city {{who did not want}} to pay for improvements. On rainy days stagecoaches would sink up to their hubcaps, and residents wore knee-high <b>boots</b> <b>to</b> wade through the mud, and at times rivers ran through the streets.|$|E
50|$|Modern motocross {{boots are}} usually nearly knee-high (about 16 inches in height) and {{made from a}} {{combination}} of leather, metal, plastic and/or man-made composite materials to create a very form-fitting, comfortable and tight <b>boot.</b> <b>To</b> allow a rider to easily get the boot on or off, the shaft of a motocross <b>boot</b> is designed <b>to</b> open lengthwise. Multiple adjustable straps (usually 3 to 4) are deployed along the foot, ankle and shaft of the <b>boot</b> <b>to</b> allow the rider <b>to</b> tighten the <b>boot</b> <b>to</b> his/her preferences and comfort. A curved plastic or composite plate covers the shin of the <b>boot</b> <b>to</b> protect the rider from debris that may be thrown from the front wheel of the motorcycle.|$|R
50|$|A ski binding is {{a device}} that connects a ski <b>boot</b> <b>to</b> the ski. Generally, it holds the <b>boot</b> firmly <b>to</b> allow the skier to {{maneuver}} the ski. However, if certain force limits are exceeded, it releases the <b>boot</b> <b>to</b> minimize skier injury, {{such as in the}} case of a fall or impact. There are different types of bindings for different types of skiing.|$|R

5|$|Specialised {{football}} boots {{began to emerge}} in the professional era, taking the place of everyday shoes or work boots. Players initially simply nailed strips of leather to their <b>boots</b> <b>to</b> enhance their grip, leading the Football Association to rule in 1863 that no nails could project from boots. By the 1880s these crude attachments had become studs. Boots of this era were made of heavy leather, had hard toecaps, and came high above a player's ankles.|$|E
5|$|This trek was {{the first}} {{recorded}} crossing of the mountainous island, completed without tents, sleeping bags, or map—their only mountaineering equipment was a carpenter's adze, a length of alpine rope, and screws from the James Caird hammered through their <b>boots</b> <b>to</b> serve as crampons. They arrived at the whaling station at Stromness, tired and dirty, hair long and matted, faces blackened by months of cooking by blubber stoves—"the world's dirtiest men", according to Worsley. They quickly organized a boat {{to pick up the}} three {{on the other side of}} South Georgia, but thereafter it took Shackleton three months and four attempts by ship to rescue the other 22men still on Elephant Island.|$|E
5|$|In the army, Nurmi quickly {{impressed}} in {{the athletic}} competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle {{on his shoulder and}} a backpack full of sand. Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers, despite his refusal to take the soldier's oath. As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice. Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, holding on to the rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army <b>boots</b> <b>to</b> strengthen his legs. Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection. In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (alikersantti). On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record on the 3000 m and {{went on to win the}} 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July.|$|E

5|$|Set in an {{alternate}} 19th century, the story focuses on {{an organization of}} exorcists, named the Black Order, as they defend humanity against the Noah Family, reincarnations of Noah and his 12 apostles whom bear hatred towards humanity and God led by a man known as the Millennium Earl. The exorcists' main weapon against the Noah Family are sentient holy artifacts called Innocence. Innocence comes {{in a variety of}} forms, varying from everyday objects such as <b>boots</b> <b>to</b> grandfather clocks, to weapons such as swords and guns; regardless of their form, each Innocence possesses unique offensive and supportive abilities and will only work for the wielder of their choosing. Out of the 109 Innocence hidden and scattered throughout the world, {{one of them is the}} master Innocence; whichever side obtains this Innocence first will win the war. In contrast to the Innocence, the Noah Family's weapons are derived from a power source known as Dark Matter. Dark Matter, grants the Noah superpowers, along with the ability to create and control demons.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} after the war, many teams in Europe were forced to wear unusual kits due to clothing restrictions. England's Oldham Athletic, who had traditionally worn blue and white, spent two seasons playing in red and white shirts borrowed from a local rugby league club, and Scotland's Clyde wore khaki. In the 1950s kits worn by players in southern Europe and South America became much more lightweight, with V-necks replacing collars on shirts and synthetic fabrics replacing heavy natural fibres. The first <b>boots</b> <b>to</b> be cut below the ankle rather than high-topped were introduced by Adidas in 1954. Although they cost {{twice as much as}} existing styles the boots were a huge success and cemented the German company's place in the football market. Around the same time Adidas also developed the first boots with screw-in studs which could be changed according to pitch conditions. Other areas were slower to adopt the new styles – British clubs again resisted change and stuck resolutely to kits little different from those worn before the war, and Eastern European teams continued to wear kits that were deemed old-fashioned elsewhere. The FC Dynamo Moscow team that toured Western Europe in 1945 drew almost as much comment for the players' long baggy shorts as for the quality of their football. With the advent of international competitions such as the European Cup, the southern European style spread {{to the rest of the}} continent and by the end of the decade the heavy shirts and boots of the pre-war years had fallen entirely out of use. The 1960s saw little innovation in kit design, with clubs generally opting for simple colour schemes which looked good under the newly adopted floodlights. Designs from the late 1960s and early 1970s are highly regarded by football fans.|$|E

25|$|Go-go dancers {{perform as}} a dancer to fast, energetic, popular music are {{employed}} to entertain crowds {{in places such as}} bars, nightclubs and discotheques in a sexually exciting manner while wearing very little clothing, often a bikini. Go-go dancing originated in the early 1960s, by some accounts when women at the Peppermint Lounge in New York City began to get up on tables and dance the twist. Other accounts claim that go-go dancing originated at, and was named for, the very popular South L.A. rock club Whiskey A Go Go which opened in January 1964. Many 1960s-era clubgoers wore miniskirts and knee-high, high-heeled boots, which eventually came to be called go-go <b>boots,</b> <b>to</b> night clubs.|$|E
