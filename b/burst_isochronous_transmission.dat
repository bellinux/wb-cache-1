40|$|Digital movie systems offer great {{perspectives}} for multimedia applications. But {{the large}} amounts of data involved {{and the demand for}} <b>isochronous</b> <b>transmission</b> and playback are also great challenges for the designers {{of a new generation of}} file systems, database systems, operating systems, window systems, video encoder/decoder and networks. Today's research prototypes of digital movie systems suffer from severe performance bottlenecks, resulting in small movie windows, low frame rates or bad image quality (or all of these!). We consider the performance problem to be the most important problem with digital movie systems, preventing their widespread use today. In this paper we address performance issues of digital movie systems from a practical perspective. We report on performance experience gained with the XMovie system and new algorithms and protocols to overcome some of these bottlenecks...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to get insight into the use of Firewire as a field bus for {{real-time}} control. A characterization of Firewire’s asynchronous transmission has been made by testing the point-to-point roundtrip in a 3 -node Firewire network. The results show Firewire’s asynchronous transmission between 2 PC/ 104 stacks, using FCP (Functional Control Protocol) as the way of implementing, can transfer data in an average latency between 100 µs and 140 µs, depending on the data payload. The maximum variation in this latency is 20 µs. During this project, it is also found that while the payload is increased, the roundtrip time does not show a significant increase: it rises only around 40 µs from 1 byte payload to 449 bytes payload. So the bus is used most efficiently when the packet is fully loaded. To get a complete insight of Firewire, it is recommended to implement Firewire’s <b>isochronous</b> <b>transmission</b> and examine its applicability for real-time control also. And to use Firewire as a field bus in a real distributed control system with a plant is als...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{high-speed}} Medium Access Control protocol based on ATM for multimedia services. This protocol supports both <b>isochronous</b> and asynchronous <b>transmission</b> services in high-speed by guaranteeing the Quality of Service for various applications with different access modes, especially the isochronous access mode for isochronous services. A simple address scheme, which {{can provide a}} simple interface with B-ISDN and supports connection-oriented/connectionless and broadcasting transmissions {{as well as the}} cell reutilization, is also discussed. The performance is briefly investigated by simulation studies...|$|R
40|$|The study {{measured}} listener {{sensitivity to}} increments in the inter-onset intervals (IOIs) of successive 20 -ms 4000 -Hz tone <b>bursts</b> in <b>isochronous</b> sequences. The stimulus sequences contained two-six tone bursts, separated equally by silent intervals, with tonal IOIs ranging from 25 to 100 ms. Difference limens (DLs) for increments of the tonal IOIs were measured to assess listener sensitivity to changes of sequence rate. Comparative DLs were also measured for increments {{of a single}} interval located within six-tone isochronous sequences with different tone rates. Listeners included younger normal-hearing adults and two groups of older adults with and without high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. The results, expressed as Weber fractions (DL∕IOI), revealed that discrimination improved as the sequence tone rate decreased {{and the number of}} tonal components increased. Discrimination of a single sequence interval also improved as the number of sequence components increased from two to six but only for brief intervals and fast sequence rates. Discrimination performance of the older listeners with and without hearing loss was equivalent and significantly poorer than that of the younger listeners. The discrimination results are examined and discussed within the context of multiple-look mechanisms and possible age-related differences in the sensory coding of signal onsets...|$|R
