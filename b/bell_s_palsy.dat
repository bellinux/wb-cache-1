40|$|Back ground: Vincristine (VCR), is a {{chemotherapy}} drug, {{useful in}} the treatment of leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumor and it is a potent neurotoxin and sensory neuropathy drug which a common behavioral toxicity of this drug. Neuropathy is common squeal of intensive chemotherapy protocols that contain vincristine and corticosteroids. Materials and Methods: This study was a retrospective and descriptive study of neuropathy during in chemotherapy program with vincristine for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Data was analyzed by spss Version 16 software. Results: From total of 51 cases, 23 patients had vincristine neuropathy (45 %). Patients with visceral neuropathy have shown ileus, constipation in 13 patients (25 %), occasionally severe diarrhea 11 (21 %), mild diarrhea 7 (13. 7 %) and transient diarrhea in 16 patients (31 %). Motor neuropathy were found in one patient with <b>Bell,</b> <b>s</b> <b>palsy</b> (1. 9 %) and one patient with Hoarseness. 12 patients (23. 5 %) had some type of complication together with sensory peripheral neuropathy. Conclusion: Almost half of patients with vincristin chemotherapy had neuropathy and the mean age of patients with neuropathy was 12. 3 years...|$|E

40|$|Background: Bell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>palsy</b> or acute {{idiopathic}} {{lower motor}} neurone facial paralysis {{is characterized by}} sudden onset paralysis or weakness of the muscles {{to one side of}} the face controlled by the facial nerve. While there is high level evidence in adults demonstrating an improvement in the rate of complete recovery of facial nerve function when treated with steroids compared with placebo, similar high level studies on the use of steroids in Bell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>palsy</b> in children are not available. The aim of this study is to assess the utility of steroids in Bell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>palsy</b> in children in a randomised placebo-controlled trial. Methods/Design: We are conducting a randomised, triple-blinded, placebo controlled trial of the use of prednisolone to improve recovery from Bell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>palsy</b> at 1 month. Study sites are 10 hospitals within the Australian and New Zealand PREDICT (Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative) research network. 540 participants will be enrolled. To be eligible patients need to be aged 6 months to < 18 years and present within 72 hours of onset of clinician diagnosed Bell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>palsy</b> to one of the participating hospital emergency departments. Patients will be excluded in case of current use of or contraindications to steroids or if there is an alternative diagnosis. Participants will receive either prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 50 mg/day or taste matched placebo for 10 days. The primary outcome is complete recovery by House-Brackmann scale at 1 month. Secondary outcomes include assessment of recovery using the Sunnybrook scale, the emotional and functional wellbeing of the participants using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and Child Health Utility 9 D Scale, pain using Faces Pain Scale Revised or visual analogue scales, synkinesis using a synkinesis assessment questionnaire and health utilisation costs at 1, 3 and 6 months. Participants will be tracked to 12 months if not recovered earlier. Data analysis will be by intention to treat with primary outcome presented as differences in proportions and an odds ratio adjusted for site and age. Discussion: This large multicenter randomised trial will allow the definitive assessment of the efficacy of prednisolone compared with placebo in the treatment of Bell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>palsy</b> in children. Trial registration: The study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN 12615000563561 (1 June 2015) ...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimentally}} observed {{violation of}} <b>Bell</b> <b>s</b> inequality {{is supposed to}} show the failure of local realism to deal with quantum reality. However, finite statistics and the time sequential nature of real experiments still allows a loophole for local realism.

Our main tool is van de Geer s (2000) supermartingale version of the classical Bernstein (1924) inequality guaranteeing, at the root n scale, a not-heavier-than-Gaussian tail {{of the distribution of}} a sum of bounded supermartingale differences. The results are used to specify a protocol for a public bet between the author and L.

We attempted to determine whether local electrical stimulation would affect nerve regeneration by comparing the clinical data before 1995 and with that after 1998. We compared the clinical data of two methods (1) acupuncture with local electrical stimulation in 58 patients and (2) acupuncture without local electrical stimulation in 55 patients. All patients were otherwise treated in the same way. The results showed that the cure rate of patients treated with acupuncture with local electrical stimulation was 62. 0...|$|R

40|$|We are {{developing}} a telemedicine application which offers automated diagnosis of facial (Bell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s)</b> <b>palsy</b> through a Web service.

Machine learning techniques (support vector machine, SVM) were {{used to examine the}} difference between the two halves of the face. If there was a sufficient difference, then the SVM recognized facial palsy. Otherwise, if the halves were roughly symmetrical, the SVM classified the image as normal. It was found that the facial palsy images had a greater Hamming Distance than the normal images, indicating greater asymmetry. The median distance in the normal group was 331 (interquartile range 277 - 435) and the median distance in the facial palsy group was 509 (interquartile range 334 - 703).
