40|$|Capsule: The data {{presented}} here demonstrate a considerable spatial overlap between wind farms and the breeding distribution of Hen Harriers in Ireland, but {{evidence for a}} negative impact of wind farms on their population is weak. Aims: To assess {{the extent of the}} overlap between wind farms and <b>breeding</b> <b>Hen</b> Harriers and to investigate their potential impact on Hen Harrier population trends. Methods: Data on Hen Harrier breeding distribution in 10 km[*]×[*] 10 km survey squares from national surveys were used in conjunction with information on the location of wind farms to examine whether, and to what extent, changes in Hen Harrier distribution and abundance between 2000 and 2010 were related to wind energy development. Results: Of the 69 survey squares holding Hen Harriers during the 2010 breeding season, 28 % also overlapped with one or more wind farms. Data from 36 of the squares with <b>breeding</b> <b>Hen</b> Harriers during the 2000 survey revealed a marginally non-significant negative relationship between wind farm presence and change in the number of breeding pairs between 2000 and 2010. Conclusions: A considerable overlap exists between Hen Harrier breeding distribution and the location of wind farms in Ireland, particularly in areas between 200 and 400 m above sea level. The presence of wind farms is negatively related to Hen Harrier population trends in squares surveyed in 2000 and 2010, but this relationship is not statistically significant, and may not be causal.

40|$|Two {{phases of}} an {{experimental}} reduction in management at Langholm Moor in southwest Scotland provided {{an insight into}} factors that determined trends in the abundance of moorland birds. In 1992 the historical control of <b>breeding</b> <b>Hen</b> Harriers Circus cyaneus stopped and in 2000 grouse moor management was discontinued. Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria, Lapwing Vanellus vanellus, Curlew Numenius arquata and Red Grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus declined, whilst Carrion Crow Corvus corone and Snipe Gallinago gallinago increased. Hen Harriers increased from two to 20 breeding females, then declined back to two. Lapwing abundance was positively associated with that of Hen Harriers, and moorland passerines (Skylark Alauda arvensis, Meadow Pipit Anthus pratensis and Stonechat Saxicola torquata) were negatively associated. Golden Plover, Lapwing, Curlew, Red Grouse, Skylark and Hen Harrier were more abundant when the moor was managed for grouse, whilst Carrion Crow, a common predator of clutches of ground-nesting birds, increased {{during the second half}} when management ceased.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in three districts of central zone of Tigray, with the aim to assess the socioeconomic characteristics and production environments of local chicken ecotypes, along with farmers’ breeding objectives, breeding practice, and traits of preference for local chickens and to assess the phenotypic characteristics of the local chicken. A total of 242 chicken owners were selected for the study. Nine qualitative and nineteen quantitative traits from 457 chickens were considered. The research finding revealed that village chicken production seems to be an important activity with an average flock size 9. 41 and 8. 98 birds per household in midland and highland agro ecology. The most important chicken production system of the study area is traditional with small feed supplementation. A separate house to keep chicken was practiced in 36. 8 % and 28. 9 % of the respondents in highland and midland area, respectively. About 87. 6 % of the respondents select eggs for incubation and straw was commonly used as bedding material. About 96. 7 % of the respondent use broody hens for incubation and rearing chicks. About 81 % of households participate in chicken and egg marketing as a source of income. Culling is practiced by 78. 9 % of households based on production level of chicken, age, plumage color, ill and bad temperament of hens and cocks. The main breeding objectives of the respondents were meant for household consumption, income generation and for replacement of the flock. The effective population size (Ne) and the rate of inbreeding (ÄF) calculated for the indigenous chicken flock of the study area were 3. 99 and 0. 13, respectively. The selection criteria used for selection of <b>breeding</b> <b>hen</b> were egg size, plumage color, broodiness, disease resistance and hatchability with an average index value of 0. 067, 0. 064, 0. 062, 0. 054, 0. 042. The highest selection criteria used for selection of breeding cock were egg number of the dam, comb type, plumage color, and disease resistance, egg size growth rate with an index value of 0. 053, 0. 052, 0. 045, 0. 044, 0. 041 and 0. 041, respectively. Farmers preferred traits like comb type, plumage color, egg size, broodiness, disease resistance, meat quality, fertility growth, egg number and body size with indices of 0. 169, 0. 156, 0. 137, 0. 117, 0. 114, 0. 113, 0. 108, 0. 096 and 0077, respectively. Reproductive performance study revealed that the overall mean age at first mating of male chickens and the age at first egg of female chickens were 5. 29 and 5. 96 months. Local chicken were mostly normally feathered (hens 97. 8 %, cocks 96 %), red (33 %), grayish (17. 5 %), brownish (17. 3 %) colors. Morph metric measurements indicated that significance differences (P< 0. 05) were observed between agro ecology with respect to breast width, spur length, chest circumferences and shank length. In all parameters, male shows higher significance (P< 0. 001) value than female except breast width and beak width. Multivariate analysis result showed that five PC were extracted that accounted for 58. 45 % of the total variation. The differentiation of highland and midland populations was apparent based on the weights of neck length, beak length, body length, wattle width, body weight, wattle length and height at back traits. The Mahalanobis’ distances between populations shows the smallest and largest distances between highland and midland chicken ecotypes. In conclusion, there is diversity of indigenous chicken population and farmers’ preference for specific traits that may invite to design community based genetic improvement.

Materials and Methods: This {{study was conducted in}} 48 apparently healthy laying hens vaccinated with Salmonella inactivated polyvalent vaccine, eggs and progeny chicks; 12 each from four different breeds of poultry,viz.,Vanraja, Gramapriya, BlackRock, and KalingaBrown. The methodology included measurement of egg and yolk weight, total protein and IgY in egg yolk, total serum protein and IgY in <b>breeding</b> <b>hens,</b> and progeny chicks and extent of IgY transfer from hens to yolk then to chicks. Further, Salmonella-specific antibodies in <b>breeding</b> <b>hens,</b> egg yolk and progeny chicks were assessed using O and H antigen by tube agglutination test. Results: The egg weight differed nonsignificantly (p> 0. 05) among breeds, however, breed wise significant variation (p 0. 05) difference among breed was found in total protein of egg yolk and chick.

40|$|Infection of <b>breeding</b> <b>hens</b> with Eimeria maxima induces {{production}} of parasite-specific antibodies which are transferred, via the egg yolk, to hatchling chicks. These antibodies (immunoglobulin G) are highly protective, mediating up to a 97 % reduction in oocyst excretion in challenged hatchlings. However, {{the degree of}} maternally derived immunity transferred by the hens to their offspring declines with increasing time after infection of the hens. This decline in immunity {{is directly related to}} declining immunoglobulin G titers. However, sera from highly protected hatchlings recognize only a very few E. maxima proteins on Western blots (immunoblots). In particular, a 230 -kDa protein band is outstanding for its association with maternally derived immunity to E. maxima in hatchlings. This band was excised from a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) preparative gel of crude merozoite protein extract.

40|$|Affinity-purified gametocyte antigens (APGA) from Eimeria maxima, {{emulsified}} in Freund's adjuvant, were injected intramuscularly into <b>breeding</b> <b>hens</b> on two {{or three}} occasions. As a result, progeny of the immunized hens were partially immune to infection with E. maxima, Eimeria tenella and Eimeria acervulina (with a reduction in total oocyst output of 45 – 63 % as compared with progeny of untreated hens). Thus, APGA in Freund's adjuvant appears to have great potential {{as part of a}} maternally applied vaccine against coccidiosis. The ability of APGA to induce partial cross-species protection is most probably due to the existence of conserved epitopes in the different species as indicated by comparative Western blots of E. maxima and E. tenella. Surprisingly, Freund's adjuvant by itself also induced significant levels of maternal immunity to coccidiosis (with a 12 – 35 % reduction in oocyst output in the progeny). In contrast to the purified antigens or Freund's alone, crude extracts from gametocytes as well as other developmental stages, induced little if any significant maternal immunity despite provoking the production of large amounts of parasite-specific IgG, including antibodies to APGA. This result indicates that a successful maternal vaccine against coccidiosis requires, in addition to good recognition of protective antigens, the exclusion of irrelevant antigens from the vaccine preparation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The current {{studies were}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} ability of humoral immune response in breed-ing hens to provide protective maternal antibody in the progeny. A highly purified outer membrane protein, 34 kDa, was isolated from a virulent strain of Salmonella Gallinarum. Cross-reactivity was observed between this protein and Salmonella Typhi porins; thus we consider this outer membrane protein as a Salmonella Gallinarum porin. To evaluate passive immunity against Salmonella Gallinarum, 200 broiler breeder hens were immunized with either 10 μg of Salmonella Gallinarum porins, 30 μg of Salmonella Gallinarum porins, or PBS without porins as a control group. Anti-Salmonella Gallinarum porin antibodies were detected in broiler breeder serum and in fertile eggs (P < 0. 05). Consequently, chickens from immunized broiler breeder hens were protected between 53 to 70 % against challenges of 20 to 500 half-maximal lethal dose of Salmonella Gallinarum (P < 0. 001) when compared with control hens that were in-jected with PBS. These results suggest that Salmonella Gallinarum porins, as those of other Salmonella species, participate in the induction of the passive protective immunity, and the humoral immune response {{may be one of}} the mechanisms involved in the establishment of this protection.

40|$|The {{production}} of anti-snake venom from large mammal’s blood {{has been found}} to be low-yielding and arduous, consequently, antivenom immunoglobulins for treatment are achieved regularly as polyvalent serum. We have standardized an undemanding technique for making purified immunoglobulin IgY antivenom consisting of polyclonal antibodies against coral snake venom in the egg yolk of immunized hens. We have adapted a reported process of antibody purification from egg yolks, and achieved 90 % antibody purity. The customized technique consisted of the removal of lipids from distilled water-diluted egg yolks by a freeze–thaw sequence. The specific immunoglobulins were present in the egg yolk for up to 180 days postimmunization. Therefore, by means of small venom quantities, a significant amount of immunoglobulins were found in an adequately purified state (The obtained material contained about 90 % pure IgY).
