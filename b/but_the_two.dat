Another hypothesis suggests that Djedkare and Menkauhor could have been cousins, being sons of Nyuserre and Neferefre respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 Gielgud met Martin Hensler (1932–99), an {{interior}} designer exiled from Hungary.

5|$|The first {{football}} {{club in the}} UK was Sheffield F.C., founded in 1857.

The first print release of the special edition CD will contain comments from the cast. The drama CDs used the same female cast as with the games and anime versions (albeit under assumed names), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> males {{that appeared in the}} dramas, Hiro and Kyosuke, had different voice actors in respect to the anime version.

5|$|After {{months of}} negotiation, John and the envoys from the Latin Empire signed a treaty in Perugia which was {{confirmed}} by Pope Gregory on 9 April 1229. John was elected emperor of the Latin Empire for life as senior co-ruler with Baldwin II, who would marry John's daughter Marie. The treaty also prescribed that although Baldwin would rule the Latin lands in Asia Minor when he was 20 years old, he would become sole emperor only after John's death. John also stipulated that his sons would inherit Epirus and Macedonia, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> regions still belonged to Emperor of Thessalonica Theodore Doukas.|$|E
5|$|Aldfrith ruled both Bernicia and Deira {{throughout}} his reign, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> parts remained distinct, and would again be {{divided by the}} Vikings in the late 9th century. The centre of Bernicia lay in the region around the later Anglo-Scottish border, with Lindisfarne, Hexham, Bamburgh, and Yeavering being important religious and royal centres. Even after Ecgfrith's death, Bernicia included much of modern southeast Scotland, with a presumed royal centre at Dunbar, and religious centres at Coldingham and Melrose. The details of the early Middle Ages in northwest England and southwest Scotland are more obscure, but a Bishop of Whithorn is known from shortly after Aldfrith's reign. York, Catterick, Ripon, and Whitby {{appear to have been}} important sites in Deira.|$|E

5|$|An ′iṣābā from Jableh led by Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam also formed {{part of the}} revolt.

Al-Bitar's unit had been active in Jabal Sahyun since early 1919 soon after French forces landed in Latakia. Al-Qassam left Syria to British-held Palestine sometime after the Battle of Maysalun to avoid capture by the French who issued a warrant for his arrest.|$|E

Wallace declined {{to be included in}} the anthology <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> became friends, exchanging many letters over the years.
