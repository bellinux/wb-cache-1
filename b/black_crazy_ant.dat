40|$|Studying nonnative species {{soon after}} their {{introduction}} {{is critical to}} understanding their risk of becoming widely invasive and determining effective methods of control. I conducted laboratory and field experiments on the Rasberry <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> (Paratrechina sp. nr. pubens), which was introduced to Pasadena, TX in 2002 and has since been spreading rapidly. These experiments focused on intraspecific aggression, {{as well as individual}} and colony-level interactions between <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> and red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta), which are dominant in the <b>crazy</b> <b>ant's</b> introduced range. <b>Crazy</b> <b>ants</b> displayed no intraspecific aggression. In individual aggressive encounters with fire <b>ants,</b> <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> had higher mortality than fire ants, but in colony-level clashes, <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> had less mortality and better control of food resources. These findings suggest that <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> abundance is key to their competitive success, and fire ants may provide biotic resistance to <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> in some areas...|$|R
40|$|Biotic {{interactions}} are often {{important in the}} establishment and spread of invasive species. In particular, competition between introduced and native species can strongly influence the distribution and spread of exotic species {{and in some cases}} competition among introduced species can be important. The Caribbean <b>crazy</b> <b>ant,</b> Nylanderia fulva, was recently introduced to the Gulf Coast of Texas, and appears to be spreading inland. It has been hypothesized that competition with the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, may be an important factor in the spread of <b>crazy</b> <b>ants.</b> We investigated the potential of interspecific competition among these two introduced ants by measuring interspecific aggression between Caribbean <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> workers and workers of Solenopsis invicta. Specifically, we examined the effect of body size and diet on individual-level aggressive interactions among <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> workers and fire ants. We found that differences in diet did not alter interactions between <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> workers from different nests, but carbohydrate level did {{play an important role in}} antagonistic interactions with fire ants: <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> on low sugar diets were more aggressive and less likely to be killed in aggressive encounters with fire ants. We found that large fire ants engaged in fewer fights with <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> than small fire ants, but fire ant size affected neither fire <b>ant</b> nor <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> mortality. Overall, <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> experienced higher mortality than fire ants after aggressive encounters. Our findings suggest that fire ant workers might outcompete <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> workers on an individual level, providing some biotic resistance to <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> range expansion. However, this resistance may be overcome by <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> that have a restricted sugar intake, which may occur when <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> are excluded from resources by fire ants...|$|R
5000|$|The Rasberry <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> or tawny <b>crazy</b> <b>ant,</b> Nylanderia fulva, is an ant {{originating}} from South America. Like the longhorn <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> (Paratrechina longicornis), this species is called [...] "crazy ant" [...] {{because of its}} quick, unpredictable movements. It is also called the [...] "Rasberry crazy ant" [...] in Texas after the exterminator Tom Rasberry, who noticed that the ants were increasing in numbers in 2002. Scientists have had trouble identifying this ant as a species owing to confusion regarding the taxonomy of the genus, but {{it has now been}} identified as Nylanderia fulva.|$|R
40|$|The yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> (Anoplolepis gracilipes) has {{destroyed}} local ecosystems in numerous countries, and their population sizes and distribution {{are likely to}} increase under global warming. To evaluate the risk of invasion by yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> in South Korea, this study identified their potential habitats and predicted their future global distribution by modeling various climate change scenarios using CLIMEX software. Our modeling predicted that future climate conditions in South Korea will be favorable for the yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ant,</b> and they could invade by the mid- 21 st century. We highlight the use of predictive algorithms to establish geographical areas with {{a high risk of}} yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> invasion under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8. 5 climate scenarios.

50|$|In September 2009, a {{helicopter}} {{was used to}} precisely bait <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> supercolonies, which covered 784 hectares of the island. A very low concentration of Fipronil bait (0.1%) was used to control the ants. Monthly monitoring of these baited supercolony sites shows that <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> densities were reduced by 99%.|$|R
50|$|It {{is thought}} Yellow <b>Crazy</b> <b>Ants</b> may also prey on nestlings.|$|R
50|$|While {{controlling}} the yellow lac scale insect {{is expected to}} control the yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> on Christmas Island, on mainland Australia it is thought this would not help. There are {{at least a dozen}} honey dew producing insects as well as extrafloral nectar from native acacia trees all of which fuel yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ants.</b>|$|R
50|$|Yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> {{have been}} found at more than 30 sites in Queensland, and in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, where a large {{scattered}} population exists. A single New South Wales infestation has already been detected and eradicated, and in Western Australia <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> have been intercepted in shipping freight arriving at Fremantle.|$|R

40|$|Yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> (Anoplolepis gracilipes) is {{a notorious}} insect which has {{destroyed}} local ecosystems when invaded. According {{to changes in}} habitats of alien species caused by the recent climate change, the risk of introducing yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> into new area has been increase. This study aimed to predict and compare future global distribution of yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> simulated based on different climate change scenarios by using CLIMEX The simulation showed that Central Africa, South America, Oceania, and Southeast Asia might {{be exposed to the}} threat of invasion under the current climate. In addition, the type of climate scenarios resulted in quantitatively different climatic suitability, while qualitative patterns of predicted distribution were similar. In conclusion, this study illustrated the use of niche model provided by CLIMEX for predicting global yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> distribution changing by climatic condition, suggesting its future application on risk assessment of invasive species and on analyzing climate change scenario...|$|R

5000|$|When Tawny <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> (Nylanderia fulva) combat Fire ants (Solenopsis invicta), {{the latter}} spray {{them with a}} toxic, lipophilic, alkaloid-based venom. The Tawny <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> then exudes its own venom, formic acid, and self-grooms with it, an action which de-toxifies the Fire ant venom. The mixed venoms {{chemically}} react with one another to form an ionic liquid, the first naturally occurring IL to be described.|$|R
50|$|A {{cost benefit}} {{analysis}} by the Queensland government found that yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> could cost Australiaâ€™s economy over $3 billion if the ants were not treated. This analysis did not take potential impacts on Australia's biodiversity into account. The known impacts of <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> in tropical rainforests overseas may provide useful insights into these impacts, bearing {{in mind that the}} most significant impacts are associated with relatively small islands, such as Christmas Island.|$|R

50|$|To {{reduce the}} impacts of <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> on red crabs and Christmas Island's {{ecosystems}} the Parks Australia carried out a major aerial baiting program in 2009, to follow up the first aerial baiting conducted in 2002. The first step was conducting an extensive island-wide survey to determine the exact locations of the supercolonies. For several months, staff traversed the island surveying over 900 sites. The result was a map of <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> supercolonies and red crab burrow densities, together with other biodiversity data.|$|R
50|$|Rasberry <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> {{have been}} known to consume the insides of {{electrical}} wiring installations, preferring DC over AC currents. This behaviour is not well understood by scientists.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the Christmas Island pipistrelle's decline is unknown. Several {{potential}} threats have been suggested: predation or disturbance at roost sites, and disease. Introduced species such as the common wolf snake, giant centipede http://www.ento.csiro.au/aicn/name_s/b_3704.htm, yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ant,</b> <b>black</b> rat or feral cats have all been identified as potential suspects responsible for the decline either through predation or disturbance of the bats. It has also been speculated that an unidentified health threat, or poisoning from the insecticide Fipronil used to control yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> 'supercolonies' could {{be responsible for the}} decline.|$|R
50|$|While baiting {{has slowed}} {{the decline of}} the red crab, its effects on the <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> populationsare only temporary, asescaping colonies invade the treated areas again, and it is expensive, {{requiring}} much man power.In an effort to find a better control, after research, Australian Parksin December 2016 imported Tachardiaephagus somervillei, a small (2mm) wasp and began breeding themfor release. The wasp, which only attacks scale insects, is a veracious predator ofwhat is believed to one of <b>crazy</b> <b>ant's</b> largest source of honey dew on Christmas Island,the yellow lac scaleinsect.|$|R
50|$|Paratrechina zanjensis is an African {{species of}} ant in the genus Paratrechina. It {{is one of}} two species in the genus, the other being the longhorn <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> (Paratrechina longicornis).|$|R
50|$|Paratrechina is an ant genus {{from the}} {{subfamily}} Formicinae (tribe Plagiolepidini). Five species {{are included in}} this genus, one of which, the longhorn <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> (Paratrechina longicornis), is a widespread pest.|$|R
50|$|The yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> is {{currently}} quarantined to Christmas Island {{where it has}} had a significant environmental impact. The primary impact is the killing and displacing of crabs on the forest floor.|$|R
50|$|In March 2014, {{researchers}} {{concluded that}} formic acid helped tawny <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> survive the fire ant venom 98% of the time; when the gland ducts were blocked with nail polish in an experiment, <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> {{had only a}} 48% chance of surviving fire ant fights. After exposure to fire ant venom, N. fulva retreats, covers itself with formic acid {{and returns to the}} fight. This is the first known example of an insect detoxifying another insect's venom, and the first discovery of an ionic liquid in nature which results from mixing of formic acid with venom from S. invicta.|$|R
50|$|The Australian Government also {{believes}} that habitat protection from or eradication of the Yellow <b>Crazy</b> <b>Ant</b> is vital {{in order for the}} species to fully recover. The Yellow Ant is known to be extremely destructive to the ecosystem on Christmas Island, often killing land crabs, endemic reptiles, and a wide range of native invertebrate. The Yellow <b>Crazy</b> <b>Ants</b> are believed to be a danger to all mammals, birds, and reptiles on the island because the ants either act as predators to the species or deplete its resources and destroy the habitat in which the species lives, causing loss of life in both scenarios.|$|R
50|$|The longhorn <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> is able {{to invade}} new {{habitats}} and out-compete other species of ant. In 1991, in the large closed dome of the research station Biosphere 2 in the Arizona Desert, no particular ant species was dominant. By 1996, the longhorn <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> had virtually replaced all the other ant species. It fed almost exclusively on the honeydew secreted by {{the large numbers of}} scale insects and mealybugs present, and other invertebrates were greatly diminished. The ones that remained were either well armoured, such as millipedes and woodlice, or were tiny and lived underground, such as springtails and mites.|$|R
5000|$|Longhorn <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> {{are able}} to mate with their {{siblings}} without showing any of the normal negative effects of inbreeding. Although the queen produces workers through normal sexual means, her daughter queens are her genetic clones and her sons are the genetic clones of her mate. The male and female gene pools thus remain completely separate (assuming workers never reproduce) and this has allowed the longhorn <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> {{to become one of}} the most widespread invasive species in the tropics. The process is known as double cloning and was discovered by evolutionary biologist Morgan Pearcy of the UniversitÃ© Libre de Bruxelles.SC ...|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the species' rapid decline is still unknown, {{although}} possibilities include predation by yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ants,</b> giant centipedes, wolf snakes, and cats; competition with five introduced reptile species; poisoning from insecticides; and disease.|$|R
50|$|Tawny <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> {{were found}} to {{displace}} other ant species in their native Argentina and later the US, including the red imported fire ant. This was first thought {{to be due to}} exploitative and interference competition.|$|R
50|$|Leiolopisma alazon (Lauan ground skink) is {{a species}} of skink found on Lau Islands of Fiji. The species is {{currently}} critically endangered due to a rise of the Yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> and rats on the islands.|$|R
50|$|How {{formic acid}} {{acts as an}} {{antidote}} against the much more toxic fire ant's venom is unknown. Fire ant venom {{is a mixture of}} toxic alkaloids and proteins that presumably enable the alkaloids to enter rival antsâ€™ cells. Each alkaloid in the fire antâ€™s venom, including solenopsin, has a six-membered heterocyclic ring with fat-soluble side chains. The researchers who discovered the antidote property of formic acid in <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> speculate that the formic acid denatures the proteins in fire ant venom. Another possibility is that the nitrogen on an alkaloidâ€™s heterocyclic ring is protonated, rendering the ionic molecule less lipophilic, thus less likely to penetrate the tawny <b>crazy</b> <b>antâ€™s</b> cells.|$|R
50|$|Staff from Christmas Island National Park {{have worked}} {{in recent years to}} keep ant numbers in check. With help from the Christmas Island <b>Crazy</b> <b>Ant</b> Scientific Advisory Panel and support from the Australian Government they are holding ground.|$|R
50|$|Nylanderia pubens is {{a species}} of ant of the genus Nylanderia, {{commonly}} called the Caribbean <b>crazy</b> <b>ant.</b> It was originally described as Paratrechina pubens from Saint Vincent, Lesser Antilles. This species was moved from Paratrechina to the genus Nylanderia in 2010.|$|R
50|$|Man-made habitat {{destruction}} {{together with the}} introduction of species such as the Yellow <b>Crazy</b> <b>Ant</b> Anoplolepis gracillipes, cats Felis catus and black rats are among the major threats to both the habitat and native wildlife including the Christmas Island Hawk-Owl.|$|R
50|$|The yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> (Anoplolepis gracilipes) is {{a species}} of ant, {{introduced}} accidentally to northern Australia and Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, that has caused ecological damage in both locations and is now found in the northern suburbs of Brisbane.|$|R
5000|$|The Christmas {{imperial}} pigeon {{was classified}} as [...] "vulnerable" [...] because of its small population and restricted distribution until 2012, when it was downgraded to near threatened". [...] Threats include illegal hunting and predation by introduced yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> Anoplolepis gracilipes.|$|R
50|$|An {{invasion}} of the yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ant</b> poses continued risk for the booby population. Yellow <b>crazy</b> <b>ants</b> formed supercolonies in the 1990s and spread throughout 28% of the islands forest. Starting in 2000, efforts to control it eliminated it from 2,800 ha of forest, resulting in a 95% reduction of its range. The range was 300 ha in 2005, at much lower densities than originally, although it has slightly recovered since then. It is thought the ants could prey on nestlings and cause nest abandonment, although {{this has not been}} observed. They do however disrupt the ecosystem by killing red crabs, and farm scale insects that damage the trees the boobies nest in.|$|R
