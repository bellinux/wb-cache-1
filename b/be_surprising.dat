Nevertheless, it became increasingly apparent that with the Nazi actions, no Jew was likely to secure {{a place on the}} German team. Brundage stated on this issue that as only 12Jews had ever represented Germany in the Olympics, it would hardly <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> if none did in 1936.|$|E

It was considered as a filming location for the TV series, however, Doune Castle was selected due to its ease of location. This may <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> to viewers who know Castle Leod as the seat of the Clan Mackenzie and accurately represents the historical period which Diana Gabaldon seeks to portray.|$|E
25|$|Since G protein–coupled receptors {{are known}} to {{activate}} Signal transduction in cells, it should not <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> to find MC1R involved in development.

The same report showed that neutralizing antibodies to MC1R prevented phosphorylation of STAT5 by erythropoietin, and that MC2R and MC5R were also involved, as shown in their model.|$|E

25|$|On 12 December 1961, the Iraqi {{government}} enacted Law No. 80, which expropriated 99.5 {{per cent}} of the IPC group’s concession areas without compensation and put an immediate stop on oil exploration. One major difference between these negotiations and those of 1952, was the stance of the Iraqi government. Whereas it had been more willing to accommodate the IPC in 1952, the government's positions under Qasim were largely non-negotiable. However this should not <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> because {{it was expected that}} Qasim would take advantage of growing Arab nationalism and a sense amongst many ordinary Iraqis that they were being exploited by the west.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} what led Ferdinando to recruit Cristofori. The Prince {{traveled}} to Venice in 1688 to attend the Carnival, so he may have met Cristofori passing through Padua on his way home. Ferdinando {{was looking for a}} new technician {{to take care of his}} many musical instruments, the previous incumbent having just died. However, it seems possible that the Prince wanted to hire Cristofori not just as his technician, but specifically as an innovator in musical instruments. It would <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> if Cristofori at age 33 had not already shown the inventiveness for which he later became famous.|$|E
25|$|Two weirs {{impede the}} flow of the river at Durham, both {{originally}} created for industrial activities. The Old Fulling Mill is now an archaeological museum. The second weir, beneath Milburngate Bridge, now includes a salmon leap and fish counter, monitoring sea trout and salmon, and is on the site of a former ford. Considering that 138,000 fish have been counted migrating upriver since 1994, it may not <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> that a family of cormorants live on this weir, and can frequently be watched stretching their wings in an attempt to dry off after feeding (as they lack the waterproofing oils present in most other waterbirds).|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} extramarital sex has been {{examined}} {{frequently in the}} United States. Many surveys asking about extramarital sex in the United States have relied on convenience samples. A convenience sample means surveys are given to whoever happens to be easily available (e.g., volunteer college students or volunteer magazine readers). Convenience samples do not accurately reflect {{the population of the}} United States as a whole, which can cause serious biases in survey results. It should not <b>be</b> <b>surprising,</b> therefore, that surveys of extramarital sex in the United States have produced widely differing results. These studies report that about 12–26% of married women and 15–43% of married men engage in extramarital sex.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} {{document}} from 1503 {{referring to the}} building as both a Sala da Água (English: Water-room) and {{a place where the}} town representatives gathered to discuss and sign contracts, therefore, it should not <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> if this supposed double-function turns out to be correct. Its construction date also becomes more clear in face of this facts, art-historian Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida noted that by its medallions, the diamond-shaped openings and the layout of windows we can date the upper level {{by the end of the}} 13th century or beginning of the 14th century, in which its already archaic Romanesque architectural style can be explained with the need of a compromise with the pre-existent cistern.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, this {{organization}} of power based upon personal relationships peculiar to the feudal system ensured that, {{after he became}} king of Scotland in 1124, {{the only thing that}} kept David from pursuing a policy of vigorous expansion was his friendship with Henry. To be sure, it should not <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> to learn that David harboured territorial ambitions– such desires were cultivated by the prevailing culture of the Normans, the greatest warriors of the age, and applauded if they ended in conquest– nor should it be any surprise that he soon sought to express them upon Henry’s death. That he should seek to place those ambitions upon a solid basis of propriety would have been even less remarkable, had a suitable excuse to attack not been conveniently at hand.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{this theory}} {{is no longer}} accepted. In 1989, Egyptologist Nabil Swelim {{examined}} the pyramid more precisely {{and found that it}} was made of small mud bricks, with a quarter of its inner core hewn out of a natural bedrock. The rock core itself contained several rock-cut tombs dating back to the 5th and 6th dynasty. Swelim and others Egyptologists, such as Toby Wilkinson, point out that it would <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> for a royal pyramid to have been completely destroyed less than 300 years after its construction, only to be re-used for simple rock-cut tombs. Additionally, he points to the unusual geographic position of the pyramid: Old Kingdom pyramids were commonly built on high grounds, while the pyramid Lepsius I lies on a flat plain. Thus, the datation of this monument to the late 3rd dynasty no longer seems tenable.|$|E
25|$|Ruby is said {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of least astonishment (POLA), meaning that the language should behave {{in such a way}} as to minimize confusion for experienced users. Matsumoto has said his primary design goal was to make a language that he himself enjoyed using, by minimizing programmer work and possible confusion. He has said that he had not applied the principle of least astonishment to the design of Ruby, but nevertheless the phrase has come to be closely associated with the Ruby programming language. The phrase has itself been a source of surprise, as novice users may take it to mean that Ruby's behaviors try to closely match behaviors familiar from other languages. In a May 2005 discussion on the newsgroup comp.lang.ruby, Matsumoto attempted to distance Ruby from POLA, explaining that because any design choice will <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> to someone, he uses a personal standard in evaluating surprise. If that personal standard remains consistent, there would be few surprises for those familiar with the standard.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the Pan American (Pan Am) games, the players came from the AAU teams. The players for the 1955 team were drawn {{primarily}} from Hanes Hosiery Mills, Wayland College Flying Queens, the Dons, and Dowells Dolls. These four teams played each other in a tournament to help select the players for the Pan Am team. Hanes Hosiery came in first ahead of Wayland Baptist. This result would not <b>be</b> <b>surprising,</b> as these were the two dominant teams of the era. Hanes Hosiery won the AAU national championship in 1951, 1952, and 1953, beating Wayland two of those three years, and Wayland would go on to win the national championship the net four years 1954–1957. Not surprisingly, the twelve player Pan American team was dominated by these two teams, with six Wayland Baptist players and three from Hanes Hosiery. While Wayland provided the largest number of players, Hanes provided the captain, Lurlyne Greer Mealhouse, who would score over 18 points per game, more than twice the second highest scorer, and still the third highest scoring average in Pan American history. Greer was considered to be the best AAU player of her era.|$|E
