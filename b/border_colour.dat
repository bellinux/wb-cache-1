40|$|The main {{goals of}} the {{experiment}} were to assess the effects of emotion on the processes of recollection and familiarity, and to ascertain which type of model best explains the processes involved in recognition memory, as there is currently disagreement between dual-process and single-process models. Subjects studied emotional real-world scenes surrounded by either red or yellow borders {{and were asked to}} memorize the scenes and their associated <b>border</b> <b>colours.</b> Item recognition tests were used to attempt to assess the familiarity process. Source memory tests were used to attempt to assess the recollection process. A significant main effect of valence on performance for hits was found, whereas valence was not found to have significantly affected performance for correct rejections. Emotional valence was found to have no significant effect on the source retrieval. Although not all of the data analysis produced significant results, the study is the first to assess the effect of emotion in recognition memory for scenes using item recognition and source retrieval tests, hence the findings set an intriguing precedent for future research...|$|R

40|$|The diverse {{effects of}} emotion on human memory {{is a topic}} of {{discussion}} that has brought about much interest within psychology (Cardwell, Clark and Meldrum, 2004) with a particular emphasis on how further understanding of its influence can aid our knowledge about the structure of underlying memory systems. In recognition memory research, dual-process models propose that judgements can be based on two independent retrieval processes: “familiarity”, based on the perception of a memory’s strength, and “recollection”, founded on its contextual information. Much of the literature suggests that emotional stimuli, compared with neutral stimuli, can boost performance for contextual recollection, but not familiarity (Doerksen and Shimamura, 2001). The present study contained a source retrieval task, where presented scenes were of positive, negative or neutral valence with either a yellow or red <b>border</b> <b>colour,</b> {{in order to assess}} the contribution of emotion’s effects on recollection. The probabilities of correctly recognizing an item and retrieving its respective <b>border</b> <b>colour</b> were noted using a counter-balanced design. It was predicated that negative scenes would be more accurately recollected than both positive and neutral scenes, whereas item recognition performance would not be affected by emotional valence. Contrary to the hypotheses, results were indicative of an effect of valence on item recognition performance for the scenes, with negative images being remembered more accurately than positive and neutral stimuli. However, recollection for the border colours of the scenes was not found to differ across valence. The findings are discussed in respect to the Yonelinas Model of Dual-Processing (Yonelinas, 1999) to show the potential effect of emotion on recollective ability despite the results, and further study implications are suggested in order to establish the potential influence of recollection on the scenes using the current source retrieval procedure by applying additional testing methods such as a remember/know task...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn recent days, {{skin cancer}} {{is seen as}} one of the most Hazardous form of the Cancers found in Humans. Skin cancer is found in various types such as Melanoma, Basal and Squamous cell Carcinoma among which Melanoma is the most unpredictable. The {{detection}} of Melanoma cancer in early stage can be helpful to cure it. Computer vision can play important role in Medical Image Diagnosis and it has been proved by many existing systems. In this paper, we present a computer aided method for the detection of Melanoma Skin Cancer using Image Processing tools. The input to the system is the skin lesion image and then by applying novel image processing techniques, it analyses it to conclude about the presence of skin cancer. The Lesion Image analysis tools checks for the various Melanoma parameters Like Asymmetry, <b>Border,</b> <b>Colour,</b> Diameter,(ABCD) etc. by texture, size and shape analysis for image segmentation and feature stages. The extracted feature parameters are used to classify the image as Normal skin and Melanoma cancer lesion...|$|E
40|$|Background/Purpose: It {{is known}} that the {{standard}} features for lesion classification are ABCD features, that is, asymmetry, <b>border</b> irregularity, <b>colour</b> variegation and diameter of lesion. However, the observation that skin patterning tends to be disrupted by malignant but not by benign skin lesions suggests that measurements of skin pattern disruption on simply captured white light optical skin images could be a useful contribution to a diagnostic feature set. Previous work using both skin line direction and intensity for lesion classification was encouraging. But these features have not been combined with the ABCD features. This paper explores the possibility of combing features from skin pattern and ABCD analysis to enhance classification performance. Methods: The skin line direction and intensity were extracted from a local tensor matrix of skin pattern. Meanwhile, ABCD analysis was conducted to generate six features. They were asymmetry, <b>border</b> irregularity, <b>colour</b> (red, green and blue) variegations and diameter of lesion. The eight features of each case were combined using a principal component analysis (PCA) to produce two dominant features for lesion classification. Results: A larger set of images containing malignant melanoma (MM) and benign naevi were processed as above and the scatter plot in a two-dimensional dominant feature space showed excellent separation of benign and malignant lesions. An ROC (receiver operating characteristic) plot enclosed an area of 0. 94. Conclusions: The classification {{results showed that the}} individual features have a limited discrimination capability and the combined features were promising to distinguish MM from benign lesion...|$|R

40|$|Conditioned {{responses}} to cues associated with drug taking play {{a pivotal role}} in a number of theories of drug addiction. This study examined whether attentional biases towards drug-related cues exist in recreational drug users who predominantly used ecstasy (3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine). Experiment 1 compared 30 ecstasy users, 25 cannabis users, and 30 controls in an attentional distraction task in which neutral, evocative, and ecstasy-related pictures were presented within a coloured border, requiring participants to respond as quickly as possible to the <b>border</b> <b>colour.</b> Experiment 2 employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the attentional distraction task and tested 20 ecstasy users and 20 controls. Experiment 1 revealed significant response speed interference by the ecstasy-related pictures in the ecstasy users only. Experiment 2 revealed increased prefrontal and occipital activity in ecstasy users in all conditions. Activations in response to the ecstasy stimuli in these regions showed an apparent antagonism whereby ecstasy users, relative to controls, showed increased occipital but decreased right prefrontal activation. These results are interpreted to reflect increased visual processing of, and decreased prefrontal control over, the irrelevant but salient ecstasy-related stimuli. These results suggest that right inferior frontal cortex may {{play an important role in}} controlling drug-related attentional biases and may thus play an important role in mediating control over drug usage...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{clustering}} technique for the recognition of pigmented skin lesions in dermatological images. It is known that computer vision-based diagnosis systems have been used aiming mostly at the early detection of skin cancer and more specifically the recognition of malignant melanoma tumour. The feature extraction is performed utilising digital image processing methods, i. e. segmentation, <b>border</b> detection, <b>colour</b> and texture processing. The proposed method belongs to a class of clustering algorithms which are very successful in dealing with high dimensional data, utilising information driven by the Principal Component Analysis. Experimental results show the high performance of the algorithm against other methods of the same class. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010...|$|R
