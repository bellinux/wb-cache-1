5|$|The 1900 season {{revealed}} grave {{problems with}} Rostislavs boilers. Black smoke from <b>burning</b> <b>oil</b> was more conspicuous than coal smoke. Uneven distribution of heat inside the boilers caused severe local overheating, buckling of fireboxes and sudden backdrafts. For {{three and a}} half months the boilers failed one by one, starting with small auxiliary power units and ending with the main boilers. Oil delivered by the Rothschild-controlled Russian Standard Oil was not at fault; similar problems were experienced by oil-fired ships of the Baltic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the <b>burning</b> <b>oil</b> in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe {{scored a}} notable {{success on the}} night of 2 December 1943 when 105 Ju 88 bombers struck the port of Bari. Skilfully using chaff to confuse the Allied radar operators, they found the port packed with brightly lit Allied shipping. The result was the most {{destructive}} air raid on Allied shipping since the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Hits were scored on two ammunition ships and a tanker. <b>Burning</b> <b>oil</b> and exploding ammunition spread over the harbour. Some 16 ships were sunk and eight damaged, and the port was put out of action for three weeks. Moreover, one of the ships sunk, SS John Harvey, had been carrying mustard gas, which enveloped the port in a cloud of poisonous vapours.|$|E

5|$|William S. Grattan sat boarded-up for {{eighteen}} months while city and fire department officials {{decided whether to}} replace her {{at a cost of}} $225,000 dollars or rebuild her for $99,000 dollars, which was $8,000 dollars more than her original cost. The decision was made to rebuild and in 1930 she was rebuilt at the Buffalo Dry Dock Company of Buffalo, New York. During this refit some improvements were made to William S. Grattan. One improvement was that her boilers were converted from burning coal to <b>burning</b> <b>oil.</b> The engines were rebuilt and her firefighting system was updated and could now handle foam fire retardant. Also, the pilot house was raised to the upper boat deck level and a fixed turret tower with a fire monitor was constructed on the stern of the ship. A fourth fire monitor was added {{to the top of the}} pilot house of the ship as well. As part of her acceptance ceremony she participated in a race against the harbor tug Kentucky, which was considered to be one of the fastest tugs on the Great Lakes.|$|E

25|$|Instead of coal, {{electricity}} {{is generated by}} <b>burning</b> <b>oil</b> shale, with largest stations in Narva. Oil shale supplies around 70% of the country's primary energy. Other energy sources are natural gas imported from Russia, wood, motor fuels, and fuel oils.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{hypothesized}} that Iraq decided {{to destroy the}} oil fields to achieve a military advantage, believing the intense smoke plumes serving as smoke screens created by the <b>burning</b> <b>oil</b> wells would inhibit Coalition offensive air strikes, foil allied precision guided weapons and spy satellites, and could screen Iraq’s military movements. Furthermore, {{it is thought that}} Iraq’s military leaders may have regarded the heat, smoke, and debris from hundreds of <b>burning</b> <b>oil</b> wells as presenting a formidable area denial obstacle to Coalition forces. The onset of the oil well destruction supports this military dimension to the sabotage of the wells; for example, during the early stage of the Coalition air campaign, the number of oil wells afire was relatively small but the number increased dramatically in late February {{with the arrival of the}} ground war.|$|E
50|$|Potassium acetate {{can be used}} as a deicer {{instead of}} {{chloride}} salts such as calcium chloride or magnesium chloride. It offers the advantage of being less aggressive on soils and much less corrosive, and for this reason is preferred for airport runways. It is, however, more expensive. Potassium acetate is also the extinguishing agent used in class K fire extinguishers because of its ability to cool and form a crust over <b>burning</b> <b>oils.</b>|$|R
40|$|Growing {{environmental}} concerns in industrialized countries have triggered {{a shift from}} burning towards rerefining. One of the most aggravating problems with used <b>oil</b> <b>burning</b> is the emission of toxic, nondegradable compounds.

50|$|Several of {{the class}} were rebuilt with {{superheated}} boilers and new cabs over their long lives beginning in the 1920s. In 1912 during the coal strike of that year No. 10 was converted to an <b>oil</b> <b>burning</b> locomotive using Holden <b>oil</b> <b>burning</b> apparatus.|$|R
25|$|As threatened, {{the wells}} were {{set on fire}} by the {{retreating}} Iraqis in March 1991, and the 600 or so <b>burning</b> <b>oil</b> wells were not fully extinguished until November 6, 1991, {{eight months after the}} end of the war, and they consumed an estimated six million barrels of oil per day at their peak intensity.|$|E
25|$|Albedo {{and climate}} {{in some areas}} are {{affected}} by artificial clouds, such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the <b>burning</b> <b>oil</b> fires were as much as 10°C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.|$|E
25|$|Several {{types of}} {{atmospheric}} aerosol {{have a significant}} effect on Earth's climate: volcanic, desert dust, sea-salt, that originating from biogenic sources and human-made. Volcanic aerosol forms in the stratosphere after an eruption as droplets of sulfuric acid that can prevail for up to two years, and reflect sunlight, lowering temperature. Desert dust, mineral particles blown to high altitudes, absorb heat and may be responsible for inhibiting storm cloud formation. Human-made sulfate aerosols, primarily from <b>burning</b> <b>oil</b> and coal, affect the behavior of clouds.|$|E
50|$|In 1865, he {{returned}} again to New Bedford {{and the oil}} business, first {{out of the kitchen}} of his Fairhaven home, then from a small store front in New Bedford. He sold a wide assortment of oils: <b>burning</b> <b>oils,</b> lubricating oils, even castor oil and salad oil. But the market niche he set out to capture was lubricating oils for delicate machinery: watches, clocks, chronometers, and later, sewing machines, typewriters, bicycles and electrical instruments.He capitalized on the work of New Bedford watch maker Ezra Kelley. Kelley discovered that oil from the jaw and head of the porpoise and blackfish proved superior to any other known lubricant for delicate mechanisms, and his oil, which he began selling in 1844, had become a benchmark industry.|$|R

25|$|Wet {{chemical}} (potassium acetate, potassium carbonate, or potassium citrate) extinguishes {{the fire}} by forming an air-excluding soapy foam blanket over the <b>burning</b> <b>oil</b> through the chemical process of saponification (an alkali reacting with a fat {{to form a}} soap) and by the water content cooling the oil below its ignition temperature. Generally class A and K (F in Europe) only, although older models also achieved class B and C fire-fighting capability in the past, current models are rated A:K (Amerex, Ansul, Buckeye and Strike First) or K only (Badger/Kidde).|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the {{significant}} effect of the two 28cm rounds on Blücher was that the first round penetrated {{the side of the}} ship and exploded inside a magazine containing cans of oil, smoke dispensers, incendiary bombs, aircraft bombs for the cruiser's Arado Ar 196 reconnaissance floatplanes and depth charges. The bulkheads on that deck were blown out and the <b>burning</b> <b>oil</b> developed into an intense fire. The second 28cm shell also knocked out the electricity central for the ship's main guns, rendering them unable to return fire.|$|E

25|$|As an {{international}} coalition under United States command assembled {{in anticipation of}} an invasion of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, the Iraqi regime decided to destroy as much of Kuwait's oil reserves and infrastructure as possible before withdrawing from that country. As early as December 1990, Iraqi forces placed explosive charges on Kuwaiti oil wells. The wells were systematically sabotaged beginning on January 16, 1991, when the allies commenced air strikes against Iraqi targets. On February 8, satellite images detected the first smoke from <b>burning</b> <b>oil</b> wells. The number of oil fires peaked between February 22 and 24, when the allied ground offensive began.|$|E
