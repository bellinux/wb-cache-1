500|$|Describing {{himself as}} a child, Cooper has said: [...] "I never lived the life of 'Oh, you're so good-looking'. People thought I was a girl when I was little, because I looked like a girl—maybe <b>because</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would keep my hair really long". He excelled at basketball, and enjoyed cooking: [...] "I used to have buddies come over after {{kindergarten}} and I'd cook them food. I prided myself in taking whatever was in the fridge and turning it into lasagna." [...] He initially wanted to attend a military academy and move to Japan to become a ninja. At an early age, his father introduced him to films like The Elephant Man, which inspired him to be an actor. Cooper says that his parents were initially apprehensive of his career choice, but they eventually changed their perceptions when they saw Cooper play the part of Joseph Merrick in {{an excerpt from the}} play The Elephant Man.|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah {{was known}} to have usually been {{accompanied}} by {{members of her family}} and the [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] filming was credited by Rashad Haughton as being the first and only time her family was not present. In October 2001, Rashad stated: [...] "It really boggles everyone [...] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there's always been myself or my mother or my father there. The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange <b>because</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled. My dad {{had to take care of}} my mom at that time. And I went to Australia to visit some friends. We really couldn't understand why we weren't there. You ask yourself maybe we could have stopped it. But you can't really answer the question. There's always gonna be that question of why." [...] Her friend Kidada Jones said in the last year of her life her parents had given her more freedom and she had talked about wanting a family. [...] "She wanted to have a family, and we talked about how we couldn't wait to kick back with our babies." ...|$|E
60|$|There is no {{good reason}} why I should try to give the details of our {{movements}} or conversation during this wofully long day. We spoke together but little, first because Simon Kenton was buried in his own thoughts or plans, and secondly <b>because</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> grief had been aroused by sight of the captives {{to such an extent}} that her sobs put an end to speech.|$|R
40|$|This {{critically}} reflective autobiographical narrative aims {{to reveal}} {{some of the}} challenges that have emerged <b>because</b> of <b>my</b> <b>mother’s</b> struggles with Alzheimer’s disease. I undertook this writing {{in an attempt to}} offer an alternative understanding of mothering, an understanding framed by <b>my</b> expe-rience of <b>mothering</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> This work weaves together the complexities of time—the past, present, and future—to form an intricate personal and intragenerational tapestry.

2500|$|In Canada, Lee's parents {{gave him}} a Jewish education, with a bar mitzvah at age 13. His father was a skilled musician, but died the year before from medical {{problems}} resulting from his imprisonment. This forced his mother to find outside work to support three children. Lee feels that not having parents at home during those years was probably a factor in his becoming a musician: [...] "It was a terrible blow that I lost him, but {{the course of my}} life changed <b>because</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> couldn't control us." [...] He said that losing his father at such an early age made him aware of how [...] "quickly life can disappear", which inspired him from then on {{to get the most out}} of his life and music.|$|E
2500|$|Bassist Tony Lombardo, some 20 {{years his}} bandmates' senior, wrote songs expressing {{his desire for}} {{stability}} and individuality. [...] "I'm Not a Punk" [...] reflected his disinterest in {{being part of the}} anarchic, destructive aspect of the punk scene: [...] "That whole thing turned me off. I just wanted to play the music and do it as best I could and I {{had a lot of fun}} doing that [...] It's like 'I'm Not a Punk'. I want to be my own person." [...] "Suburban Home" [...] was quite literal, expressing his desire for [...] "a house just like mom and dad's": [...] "I definitely wanted a home. I couldn't live in a place where all the people are cool. I don't like dysfunctionality. I have an abhorrence of dysfunctionality <b>because</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was an alcoholic, my parents are divorced, I just don't need that assault on my emotions and psyche." ...|$|E

6000|$|Con. Why comes she not? I {{watched her}} slender form when {{with the other}} slaves she went forth to the {{fountain}} yonder. I knew her by the rosy veil and snow-white arm that bore the water-urn. The morning sun shone brightly on the golden hair, and seemed more beautiful for resting there; and now 'tis nearly set, and yet she comes not. Why should I grieve <b>because</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> slave forgets me? Shame on thee, Constantine! How weak and childish have I grown! This fever gives no rest when Ione is not here to sing sweet songs, and cheer the weary hours. Ah, she comes! [Enter Ione with basket of flowers.] Where hast thou been, Ione? The long day passed so slowly, and I missed thee sadly from my side. But thou art pale; thy locks are damp! What has chanced to thee? Speak, I beseech thee! ...|$|R

5000|$|For {{these few}} {{early years of}} his career, Bair says he [...] "used my legal name which is Michael Hernandez.

6000|$|... "Who would sift {{the matter}} to the bottom? Scolding one party or the other was of no avail. Threats only serve to {{aggravate}} people in such cases. I never was in danger but once, young people," [...] said Madame de Bernstein, [...] "and I think that was <b>because</b> <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> contradicted me.

6000|$|This but fed {{the light}} flame of his easy perception--which lighted for him, if she would, {{all the facts}} equally. [...] "And they're worried now, you imply, <b>because</b> <b>my</b> terrible <b>mother</b> is capable of heavy gains and of making a great noise if she isn't paid? I ought to mind {{speaking}} of that truth," [...] he went on as with a practised glance {{in the direction of}} delicacy; [...] "but I think I should like you to know that I myself am not a bit ignorant of why it has made such an impression here." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{followed}} her into the other house, conscious of the dismay and bitterness which burst forth the instant they were alone. [...] "What am I to do? She is my mother, but I've lost all sense of relationship to her. And these people--except you and Mr. Redfield--are all disgusting to me. It isn't <b>because</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is poor, it isn't because she's keeping boarders; it's something else." [...] At this point her voice failed her.|$|E

5000|$|My God, that gravy is horrible. They buy {{tap water}} for 15 to 20 cents a {{thousand}} gallons {{and then they}} mix it with flour and starch and end up with pure wallpaper paste.

60|$|From October 1775 to October 1778. These {{three years}} I {{continued}} at the Reading School, because I was {{too little to}} be trusted among my Father's schoolboys. After break-fast I had a halfpenny given me, with which I bought three cakes at the baker's shop close by the school of my old mistress; and these were my dinner every day except Saturday and Sunday, when I used to dine at home, and wallowed in a beef and pudding dinner. I am remarkably fond of beans and bacon: and this fondness I attribute to my Father's giving me a penny for having eaten a large quantity of beans on Saturday. For the other boys did not like them, and, as it was an economic food, my Father thought my attachment to {{it ought to be}} encouraged. He was very fond of me, and I was my Mother's darling: in consequence whereof I was very miserable. For Molly, who had nursed my brother Francis, and was immoderately fond of him, hated me <b>because</b> <b>my</b> <b>Mother</b> took more notice of me than of Frank; and Frank hated me <b>because</b> <b>my</b> <b>Mother</b> gave me now and then a bit of cake when he had none,--quite forgetting that for one bit of cake which I had and he had not, he had twenty sops in the pan, and pieces of bread and butter with sugar on them from Molly, from whom I received only thumps and ill names.|$|E
60|$|The {{reason that}} I ran {{so hard and}} then paused by the elm, was <b>because</b> <b>my</b> widowed <b>mother</b> lived in that house.

My second, that which caused me to pause by the tree, was how I should break the news to her in such a fashion that she would not be over-frightened. Having thought this over I went on into the house.|$|R

"It {{makes her}} so happy," [...] Grizel said, [...] "that when I {{seem to see}} her now she looks as sweet and pure as {{she must have been}} in the days when she was an {{innocent}} girl.

2500|$|The 13th Dalai Lama {{therefore}} {{sought to}} clarify his view about Dorje Shugden's status {{in his letter}} to Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo, in which he identified Dorje Shugden as a [...] "wrathful worldly spirit", the propitiation of which [...] "contradicts the precepts of taking refuge". [...] In reply, Phabongka (who is better remembered for his teachings on the graded stages of the path and reputation of conferring Kalachakra empowerments to large crowds of laypeople regardless of his having enthusiastically propitiated Shugden) acknowledged his [...] "error". [...] In the same letter, Phabongka said [...] "...I have propitiated Shugden until now <b>because</b> <b>my</b> old <b>mother</b> told me that Shugden is the deity of my maternal lineage", thereby acknowledging Shugden practice's provincial and even familial (as well as Sakya) origins.|$|R

And I {{was the same as}} a member of the family; and they loved me, and petted me, and did not give me a new name, but called me by my old one that was dear to me <b>because</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had given it me--Aileen Mavoureen.

6000|$|So {{this one}} also was killed, {{and these were}} but the first of thousands, for {{presently}} Chaka grew mad with wickedness, with fury, and with the lust of blood. He walked to and fro, weeping, going now and again into his hut to drink beer, and I with him, for he said that we who sorrowed must have food. And ever as he walked he would wave his arm or his assegai, saying, [...] "Take them away, the heartless brutes, who do not weep <b>because</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is dead," [...] and those who chanced to stand before his arm were killed, till at length the slayers could slay no more, and themselves were slain, because their strength had failed them, {{and they had no}} more tears.

60|$|Captain Smith, my master, found {{plenty of}} work for me during the weeks before the fleet sailed.
