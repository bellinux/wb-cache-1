5|$|Remains of Deinonychus, {{a closely}} related dromaeosaurid, have {{commonly}} <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> aggregations of several individuals. Deinonychus has also <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> association {{with a large}} herbivore, Tenontosaurus, which {{has been seen as}} evidence of cooperative hunting. The only solid evidence for social behavior among dromaeosaurids comes from a Chinese trackway of fossil footprints, which shows six individuals of a large species moving as a group, though no evidence of cooperative hunting was found. Although many isolated fossils of Velociraptor have <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Mongolia, none were closely associated with any other individuals. Therefore, while Velociraptor is commonly depicted as a pack hunter, as in Jurassic Park, there is only limited fossil evidence to support this theory for dromaeosaurids in general, and none specific to Velociraptor itself. The pack hunting theory was based on a discovery of several specimens of Deinonychus found around the remains of a Tenontosaurus. No other group of dromaeosaurids has <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> close association.|$|E
