It is mostly restricted to the Andes mountains throughout the northern portions of its range, while in the south its range <b>broadens</b> to include the coast.

5|$|Division forms two polyps {{that each}} become {{as large as}} the original. Longitudinal {{division}} begins when a polyp <b>broadens</b> and then divides its coelenteron (body), effectively splitting along its length. The mouth divides and new tentacles form. The two polyps thus created then generate their missing body parts and exoskeleton. Transversal division occurs when polyps and the exoskeleton divide transversally into two parts. This means one has the basal disc (bottom) and the other has the oral disc (top); the new polyps must separately generate the missing pieces.|$|E
5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb is {{the only}} known {{exoplanet}} in the orbit of host star MOA-2009-BLG-387L. The planet {{is estimated to be}} 2.6 times the mass of Jupiter. However, because knowledge of the exact parameters of the planet are tied to the host star's parameters, and the host star's parameters are not well-constrained, uncertainty places MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb's mass between 1.0 and 6.7 times that of Jupiter. The planet is estimated to orbit its host star every 1970 days at a distance of 1.8 AU, some 1.8 times the mean distance between Earth and the Sun. Uncertainty <b>broadens</b> the mean distance to between 1.1 and 2.7 AU.|$|E

[...] Of the two forms of <b>broadening,</b> homogeneous <b>broadening</b> is simply {{the result of the}} lifetime of the isomeric state: the shorter the lifetime, the more <b>broadened</b> the line.

40|$|The {{numerical}} simulations {{with the}} method of split-step Fourior were presented to investigate the effect of initial chirp on supercontinuum generation in photonic crystal fibers. According to the fiber length, the evolution of pulse in photonic crystal fibers was divided into three stages: initial <b>broadening</b> stage, dramatic <b>broadening</b> stage and saturation <b>broadening</b> stage. By discussing the differences in evolution of the chirp pulse and non-chirp pulse in each stage, {{we find that the}} initial chirp only affects the spectrum at the initial <b>broadening</b> stage and the dramatic <b>broadening</b> stage, and the chirp is profitable for spectrum <b>broadening</b> when beta(2) C 0. In the saturation <b>broadening</b> stage, chirp does not affect the spectrum anymore. If we want to <b>broaden</b> the spectrum by using chirp pulse we must choose a right fiber length, and output the pulse in the dramatic <b>broadening</b> stage. These conclusions provide significant reference for supercontinuum generation in photonic crystal fibers with chirp pulse...|$|R
5|$|Riparian {{vegetation}} {{is mostly}} found along the lower {{two-thirds of the}} Kootenay {{and many of the}} tributaries that join within the United States. The other sections of the river flow through far more rugged terrain and are characterized by braiding, low nutrient content, shifting channels and coarse sediments, making it difficult for riparian zones to be established, as is with most of its upper and lower tributaries. Wetlands are found primarily where the river <b>broadens</b> into a series of sloughs, side-channels, marshes and small lakes before entering Kootenay Lake. This biologically diverse area, the Kootenay Flats, once supported over 1 million migratory birds every year, before the river was diked and many of the wetlands converted to agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Xenogears {{initially}} {{takes place}} on Ignas, the largest continent of the Xenogears world, and {{the site of a}} centuries-long war between the nations of Aveh and Kislev. A church-like organization known as the Ethos has excavated gears (giant robot suits), ostensibly for the preservation of the world's culture. Although Kislev originally had the upper hand in the war, a mysterious army known as Gebler appeared and began to provide assistance to Aveh. With Gebler's help, the Aveh military not only recovered its losses, but began making its way into Kislev's territory. As the story unfolds, the setting <b>broadens</b> to encompass the entire world and the two floating countries, Shevat and Solaris. Solaris, ruled by Emperor Cain and an AI collective known as the Gazel Ministry, commands the Gebler army and the Ethos and secretly uses both to dominate the land-dwellers. Shevat has been the only country to evade the control of Solaris.|$|E

40|$|In many neurons, trains {{of action}} {{potentials}} show frequency-dependent <b>broadening.</b> This <b>broadening</b> {{results from the}} voltage-dependent inactivation of K+ currents that contribute to action potential repolarisation. In different neuronal cell types these K+ currents {{have been shown to}} be either slowly inactivating delayed rectifier type currents or rapidly inactivating A-type voltage-gated K+ currents. Recent findings show that inactivation of a Ca 2 +-dependent K+ current, mediated by large conductance BK-type channels, also contributes to spike <b>broadening.</b> Here, using whole-cell recordings in acute slices, we examine spike <b>broadening</b> in lateral amygdala projection neurons. Spike <b>broadening</b> is frequency dependent and is reversed by brief hyperpolarisations. This <b>broadening</b> is reduced by blockade of voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels and BK channels. In contrast, <b>broadening</b> is not blocked by high concentrations of 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) or alpha-dendrotoxin. We conclude that while inactivation of BK-type Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels contributes to spike <b>broadening</b> in lateral amygdala neurons, inactivation of another as yet unidentified outward current also plays a role...|$|R
40|$|We derive an {{analytical}} expression for the <b>broadening</b> of a Gaussian input pulse in an arbitrary linear slow light medium.

It is shown that for a Lorentzian gain profile, the amplitude <b>broadening</b> is dominant at small fractional delays.
