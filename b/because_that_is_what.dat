25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> they would like the outcome to be. This also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E

500|$|Pascu parted with Divertis in 2007. At the time, he {{indicated}} that {{he could no longer}} handle their tight schedule. The break was not total, though, since Pascu continued to appear on Animat Planet. In a 2007 interview, reflecting on that show's impact, he stated, [...] "I'm not much of a fan of political humor. I simply like the impromptu kind of humor [...] If [...] happens to be political, it is <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> we have to do in this series." [...] In 2012, he asserted that his break with political humor was definitive, and against the consensus in Divertis—in 2007, Pascu noted there was already a disagreement between him and Toni Grecu. Shortly after his departure, a conflict between Grecu and the other Divertis actors broke Divertis into competing halves.|$|E

James Parker of The New York Times describes her as animated, powerless, prone to fits, and at times distracted. He notes that she motorcades and entourages with importance, but also passes time rotating dreamily in her swivel chair. Parker opines that Meyer [...] "swears her head off" [...] <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> the modern [...] "gaffe-phobic, linguistically constipated" [...] public servant who has sold his/her soul to a lobbyist group does behind closed doors after public speeches about [...] "ceaseless, toneless platitudes".

One can play with the processes that might occur in the future, but one is really always writing about the present <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> we know.

Sean Day-Lewis, writing in The Daily Telegraph, hailed the programme as a [...] "highly original play written with great force and making as many valid points {{about the dangers of}} the future as any science fiction I can remember—including 1984!". The Year of the Sex Olympics was watched by 1.5 million viewers. Audience Research Report indicated that many viewers found the play impenetrable. It was repeated on BBC1 in 1970 with 15 minutes cut from the running time, as part of The Wednesday Play strand.|$|E
500|$|In February 2005, Lost {{producers}} {{began looking}} for a Latina woman in her mid-thirties {{who would be the}} leader of the tail section, and a romantic interest for Jack. The agent of Michelle Rodriguez (who was 26 at the time) called the producers, informing them Rodriguez was interested in the role, but only for a year. Rodriguez, producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, and Lost creator J. J. Abrams met, and Rodriguez explained she would only be interested in one season because she was a [...] "nomadic spirit", but would like to do one [...] "kickass arc" [...] as she called it. The producers liked her energy, so agreed, with the plan to kill Ana Lucia {{at the end of the}} season. Rodriguez felt she had been typecast in tough female roles, so wanted this role to be different. Ana Lucia was planned to start as a tough character, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> the audience would expect, then the layers of the character would be gradually peeled back. Rodriguez described Ana Lucia as an [...] "animalistic type creature... tamed by the Island." [...] They reconstructed the character slightly to fit what they liked about Rodriguez, such as making her more [...] "street smart" [...] with a [...] "speak-her-mind quality." [...] Ana Lucia made her first appearance in the penultimate episode of season one, in order to set up her character becoming part of the cast in the next season. All Rodriguez was told about her character was both she and her mother were in the police force. Ana Lucia's style of leadership deliberately contrasts Jack's; Jack is a reluctant leader, whereas Ana Lucia quickly takes charge on her own. In her early appearances, Ana Lucia is shown to be very tough, so the flashbacks in [...] "Collision", where it is revealed [...] she lost her baby, were used to show a softer side to her.|$|E

2500|$|... {{has been}} of central {{significance}} {{to the development of}} human society. It can be the beginning, not only of individual knowledge, information and awareness, but also a holistic strategy for development and change. Education is very much connected to women's ability to form social relationships on the basis of equality with others and to achieve the important social good of self-respect. It is important, as well, to mobility (through access to jobs and the political process) and to health and life (through the connection to bodily integrity). Education can allow women to participate in politics so they can ensure that their voices and concerns are heard and addressed in the public policy. It is also crucial for women's access to the legal system. Although it must be considered that religion and traditions of the Pakistani affect women's education. Some women may choose to keep the traditional roles <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> they have always known and are used to. It would be a great opportunity if women were able to make their choice on their own, though. They should at least have the knowledge of both sides to be educated or to stay with the traditional ways.|$|E
2500|$|Stringer characterised Morrissey as a {{man with}} various {{contradictory}} traits, being [...] "an ordinary, working-class 'anti-star' who nevertheless loves to hog the spotlight, a nice man who says the nastiest things about other people, a shy man who is also an outrageous narcissist". He further suggested that part of Morrissey's appeal was that he conveyed {{the image of a}} [...] "cultivated English gentleman (and being every inch the typically English 'gent' he is perfectly representative of that type's loathing for cant and hypocrisy, and his fragile, quasi-gay sexuality)". Similarly, Morrissey biographer David Bret described the singer as being [...] "quintessentially English", while Simpson termed him a Little Englander. During the 1980s, interviewer Paul Morley stated that Morrissey [...] "sets out to be a decent man and he succeeds <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> he is." [...] Eddie Sanderson, who interviewed Morrissey for the Mail on Sunday in 1992, said that [...] "underneath all the rock star flim-flam, Morrissey is actually a very nice chap, excellent company, perfectly willing and able to talk about any subject one cared to throw at him". Having photographed him in 2004, the photographer Mischa Richter described Morrissey as [...] "genuinely lovely".|$|E

2500|$|The Nazi {{woman had}} {{to conform to}} the German society desired by Adolf Hitler (Volksgemeinschaft), racially pure and {{physically}} robust. She did not work, living in the naturalization of motherhood and following the slogan of the former emperor William II of Germany: Kinder, Küche, Kirche, meaning [...] "Children, kitchen, church". In a document published in 1934, The Nine Commandments of the Workers' Struggle, Hermann Goering bluntly summarizes the future role of German women: [...] "Take a pot, a dustpan and a broom and marry a man". This was anti-feminism {{in the sense that the}} Nazis considered political rights granted to women (access to high-level positions for example) as incompatible with the nature of reproduction, the only role within which they could blossom and best serve the interests of the nation. Thus, Magda Goebbels declared in 1933: [...] "German women were excluded from three professions: the army, as elsewhere in the world; the government; and the judiciary. If a German girl must choose between marriage or a career, she will always be encouraged to marry, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> is best for a woman". It is not possible to make a mental leap to the conservative and patriarchal societies that prevailed for example during the Second Empire; in effect, the totalitarian character of the regime moved away from the concept that had been made of women being put on a shelf by society. On the contrary, they were expected to participate at the ground level in the roles of mother and spouse. The fact that the regimentation of women (Bund Deutscher Mädel then Frauenschaft) being so organized, did not permit relegating women to what they could do in the 19th century. Without a doubt, a conservative electorate and a fringe part of the population very critical of the image of the emancipated woman from the 1920s found a certain satisfaction in the new regime. But the goals were different, asking each woman to take part in the building of the [...] "Reich of 1000 years". Female liberation found itself therefore necessarily limited, and Heide Schlüpmann stated conclusively in Frauen und Film, that the films of Leni Riefenstahl (the official film director of the regime) [...] "value quite a negation of female sexuality and only offer women a deceptive autonomy".|$|E
