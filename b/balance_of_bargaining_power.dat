Relative spousal earnings may be a good proxy for the long-term balance of power to an extent that cross-sectional variation in relative earnings across households reflects the pattern of spousal matching.

We find that {{in the presence of}} recourse, default rates are lower for a given loan-to-value ratio, equilibrium coupon rates are lower, loan-to-value ratios are higher and welfare is improved. We find that higher loan-to-value ratios under recourse, increase welfare but can lead to higher equilibrium default rates. We find that when the bank has monopoly power during renegotiation, contracts with renegotiation are an improvement over contracts without renegotiation. Increase in homeowner renegotiation bargaining power, beyond a threshold, has a negative effect on equity value since the surplus that the homeowner can extract ex-post is priced into the initial mortgage rate.

40|$|Enpirical {{case study}} {{analysis}} of shop steward organisation within three specific manufacturing plants in Merseyside {{has been conducted}} {{with the aim of}} contributing {{to an understanding of the}} dynamics of steward organisation, activity and consciousness within British manufacturing industry more generally. This involves not merely a snap-shot of contemporary developments but an historical overview of the past 20 years that will be of relevance to an understanding of potential future trends. Methods of data collection include extensive interviews - with shop stewards, union members, managers and full-time union officials - analysis of documentary evidence and personal observation. The research is informed by a Marxist analytical framework, namely that there is a contradiction in the nature of workplace trade unionism - between conflict and acconinodation in stewards' relationship to management, between democracy and bureaucracy in stewards' relationship to rank and file members and between independence and dependence in stewards' relationship to full-time union officials. Because the balance struck between these interrelated and overlapping tendencies varies, depending on the level of workers' confidence, activity and militancy vis-a-vis management, an evaluation is made of the different 'micro-level' factors which affect the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>power</b> in each workplace and of the way these are located within the much broader 'macrolevel' social, economic and political context of the changing balance of class forces in society, with a contrast being drawn between the broad upturn in workers' struggles during the 1970 s and the downturn of the 1980 g. A central concern is a critique of Eric Batstone's 'strong bargaining relations' model of pragmatic shop steward organisation, which, as the case studies illustrate, merely serves to reinforce the limitations and compromises of workplace trade unionism within capitalist society.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical model of strategic default {{to assess how}} national and international policymakers should seek to influence the cost of default and the distribution <b>of</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>power</b> {{in the event of}} a default. We find that, in the absence of restrictions on the parameter space, deadweight costs of default should be driven to zero. Moreover, if the debtor is risk-averse, there is an optimal division <b>of</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>power</b> between the debtor and its creditors. Even with restrictions on the parameter space, marginally lower deadweight costs, possibly in some combination with greater creditor <b>bargaining</b> <b>power,</b> can always raise social welfare ex ante. However, once debt has been contracted, the debtor's trade-off between creditor <b>bargaining</b> <b>power</b> and deadweight costs changes fundamentally. In equilibrium, the deadweight costs of default may therefore tend to be too high, and the allocation <b>of</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>power</b> inefficiently skewed towards the debtor. The challenge for policymakers is to find credible, time-consistent combinations of policies that can both reduce deadweight costs and shift <b>bargaining</b> <b>power</b> towards creditors.

40|$|Privatisation (defined as {{change of}} {{ownership}} and control of State-owned enterprises- SOEs) is a controversial economic and political policy that elicits diverse opinions and academic conclusions on its impact. With regard to its impact on industrial relations, the privatisation literature concludes that in most privatised SOEs, problems anise between unions and management over some important dimensions of the employment relationship. This Author's search of the privatisation literature {{led to the emergence}} of two hypotheses, as follows: I. The employment relationship changes in its expression and management in privatised enterprises {{as a consequence of the}} change in ownership and control, structure and product market competition arising from privatisation; and, 2. The employment relationship in privatised enterprises changes, not necessarily as a consequence of privatisation, but as a consequence of changes in managerial/corporate strategies, national and firm-level industrial relations policies and other environmental factors not related to privatisation. Data was collected from two privatised finance SOEs and one privatised petroleum SOE in Nigeria to test these hypotheses. Some key findings emerged which differ slightly from the conclusions of the privatisation literature, as represented by these two hypotheses. First, the study concludes that contrary to the conclusion of the privatisation literature, the observed changes in the employment relationship of privatised SOEs are mediated by the different effects of environmental and sectoral factors, economic centrality, the nature of the unions involved in bargaining and the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>power</b> between unions and management, as determined by the development context of the country concerned. Secondly, the study concludes that contrary to the conclusions of the privatisation literature, the employment relationship in privatised enterprises changes as a consequence of changes in managerial/corporate strategies and fin-n-level industrial relations strategies directly related to privatisation. These conclusions suggest the need to slightly modify the conclusions of the privatisation literature and theory to take account of the economic, institutional and political differences between developing and developed economies, rather than seek to apply similar theories and conclusions to both development contexts like is currently the case.

40|$|Executive summary:The Work Choices reforms {{substantially}} {{altered the}} rules for making agreements. This report identifies at least 15 {{ways in which the}} legal framework has shifted the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>power</b> away from employees. The introduction of a ‘Fairness Test’ purports to remedy the effects of just one of these changes: the removal of the ‘no disadvantage test’. It is clear that this single measure will be unable to address the multiple ways in which the framework undermines the bargaining position of employees. Contrary to the Government’s assertions, the Fairness Test is not, by any measure, stronger than the former ‘no disadvantage test’ – the new test is clearly narrower in scope and provides fewer procedural protections than the former test. Overall, there must be considerable doubt that the Fairness Test will provide outcomes which are procedurally or substantively fair for employees. The emerging evidence of outcomes under workplace agreements confirms that the potential for the new framework to undermine the bargaining position of employees has been realised. Data on employer greenfields agreements strongly suggests that substantial numbers of employees have received no compensation for the removal of protected award conditions via these agreements. A combination of statistical and anecdotal evidence leads to a similar conclusion in relation to AWAs. In the case of collective agreements, the report highlights a number of templates which are being used to set the terms and conditions of employment for retail and hospitality workers. Following a reduction in the involvement of traditional third parties in agreement-making (ie, the AIRC and unions), these templates have been adopted (often without alteration) by many employers. The effect is to allow an alternative third party - the industrial relations consultant - to exercise significant influence over the content of agreements. The widespread replication of these templates in collective agreements in the retail and hospitality industries suggests that there is very little genuine bargaining taking place. A study of the templates themselves reveals {{the extent to which it}} is possible for an employer to reduce and remove employee benefits through the powerful mechanism of the Work Choices workplace agreement. The templates provide instances of the reduction of employee rights of control over hours of work, rostering, job location and job functions. The effect of these provisions is not only to displace conditions from awards and State legislation, but also to jeopardise the rights of an employee under his or her individual contract of employment. The report also highlights some of the problems which have arisen because of the removal of a certification or vetting process before agreements are approved. The existence of provisions in agreements which fall below the ‘safety net’, or which mislead employees about their legal entitlements, suggests that the new framework is failing to ensure compliance with the basic legal rules. The legal framework also appears to legitimate certain unfair employer bargaining practices by removing any positive requirement for employers to explain the effect of workplace agreements to employees, or to obtain genuine approval for these agreements, and by providing only weak protections against false or misleading conduct and duress. These unfair (but not unlawful) practices include: offering AWAs on a take-it-or-leave-it basis to new employees; using employer greenfields agreements on new projects to set a low base of employment conditions and to create a union-free environment; and ‘starving out’ employees by holding back pay rises until the employees enter into AWAs. Perhaps emboldened by the environment created by Work Choices, some employers are engaging in unlawful bargaining practices, such as targeting employees who refuse to sign AWAs by reducing their shifts, or threatening to remove other employee benefits, or ending their employment. Fundamental changes, not stop-gap measures, are required to address the bargaining practices and agreement outcomes which are permitted, and to some extent encouraged, under the Work Choices framework. Without legislative reform to ensure genuine bargaining and compliance with the agreement-making rules, it is inevitable that the working conditions of vulnerable employees will be further diminished...|$|E
