5|$|As the company's only engineer, Bristow rapidly {{developed}} a prototype himself before turning the game over to new hire Lyle Rains {{to develop into}} a finished product, codenamed K2 Tank. Rains added the maze and central minefield to the game design and developed the final hardware, including the simple control scheme. Peter Takaichi designed a large custom cabinet to house it. Tank {{was one of the}} first games to use integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (read-only memory)—to store graphical data, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used; it is sometimes claimed in sources to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first, but was preceded at minimum by Atari's Gran Trak 10 (1974). Integrated circuit-based memory thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. Before the game could be completed, in September 1974 Atari announced plans to merge itself and Kee Games back together; Tank was released that November just prior to the merger in December 1974.|$|E

DBM released two demos, Death of a Soul (1990) and Slayer of Evil (1991) before the Lehtinen brothers left the band due to the distance between Laukaa and Kokkola. Aki Särkioja, who would form Immortal Souls with his brother Esa in December 1991, also played in DBM for a short while until the band changed their name to Cathacomb and split up after releasing few demos.|$|E
25|$|The first {{congregation}} {{is mainly}} {{represented by the}} urban area population and emerged {{during the period of}} the Republic of Turkey. For many decades, this group of people belonged to the political left and presumed the Aleviness just as an outlook on the individual human life rather than a religious conviction by persistently renouncing the ties of the Batiniyya-Alevism with Twelver political branch of Shia Islam. The followers of this congregation, who later turned out to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> stern defenders of the Erdoğan Çınar hold ritual unions of a religious character and have established cultural associations named after Pir Sultan Abdal as well. According to their philosophy, human being should enjoy a central role reminiscent of the doctrine of Khurramites, and as illustrated by Hurufi phrase of God is Man quoted above {{in the context of the}} Trinity.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1840s, John Lloyd Stephens' bestseller, Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan. Stephens' two-volume work {{was seen by}} some church members as an {{essential}} guide to the ruins of Book of Mormon cities. In the fall of 1842, an article appearing in the church's Times and Seasons alleged that the ruins of Quirigua, discovered by Stephens, may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> ruins of Zarahemla or some other Book of Mormon city. Other articles followed, including one published shortly {{after the death of}} Joseph Smith. Every Latter Day Saint was encouraged to read Stephens' book and to regard the stone ruins described in it as relating to the Book of Mormon. It is now believed that these Central American ruins date more recent than Book of Mormon times.|$|E
25|$|The first {{internal}} combustion piston engine design to be widely used for powering aircraft was the Antoinette water-cooled V8 engine, believed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first V-form eight-cylinder {{internal combustion}} engine ever placed in production, designed by the Frenchman Léon Levavasseur. The Antoinette 8V incorporated direct fuel injection, evaporative water cooling and other advanced features, weighed 95kg (209lb) and produced 37kW (50hp). Introduced in 1906, these engines were used by, among others, Santos Dumont, the early Voisin aircraft and Samuel Cody. American aviation engine designers quickly {{picked up on the}} V-8 engine concept from 1906 onwards as the era progressed, with both Glenn Curtiss' firm designing a series of liquid-cooled V-8 aviation engines culminating in the Curtiss OX-5 by the early years of World War I — another major American engine manufacturer, Hall-Scott, had their A-2 and A-3 overhead valve, liquid-cooled V-8s in production as early as 1908.|$|E
25|$|Analysts and pollsters offered {{different}} opinions on whether smaller extraparliamentary parties had chances to enter parliament or not. According to some pollsters, the FRITZ had very good {{chances of getting}} into parliament, and the LIF with its founder Schmidt as its leading candidate, as well; the conditions were {{as good as they}} had never been before for smaller parties, according to some. Analysts agreed that apart from LIF and FRITZ, all others would fail to enter parliament. Analysts furthermore asserted that the candidacy of the FRITZ would likely make the race for third place between Greens and FPÖ very competitive, as the FRITZ would likely gain protest votes which would otherwise go to the FPÖ. The critical time for the extraparliamentary parties was stated to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first phase of the campaign, when the larger parties had not yet really started campaigning and the smaller parties had a chance to gain publicity.|$|E

25|$|Harris {{was soon}} moving again, sailing to Portugal to {{participate}} in the opening actions of the British involvement in the Peninsular War. Harris was at the very first action, a skirmish at the town of Óbidos, where he saw Lieutenant Ralph Bunbury fall, the first British casualty of the war. On 17 August 1808 he was in the hotly contested skirmish line at Battle of Rolica, and saw serious opposition for the first time, reporting it as an exhilarating and terrifying experience. Many of his companions were killed at this action and the ensuing Battle of Vimeiro, but Harris remained unhurt, continuing the march to Salamanca before becoming trapped in northern Spain with the rest of Sir John Moore's army. The Light Brigade of Robert Craufurd, which included the 2nd/95th, did not march {{with the rest of the}} army to Corunna but marched to Vigo. The sights and horrors of the march remained with him for decades to come, and he was lucky to escape, claiming to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> last man collected from the beaches at Vigo, and embarking for England in a severely weakened state.|$|E
25|$|Hoover entered Stanford University in 1891, its inaugural year, {{after failing}} all the {{entrance}} exams (except mathematics) {{and then being}} tutored for the summer in Palo Alto. Hoover claimed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first student at Stanford, by virtue of having been {{the first person in}} the first class to sleep in the dormitory. Hoover worked a variety of odd jobs to support himself, and struggled in many of his classes, especially English. But he found a happiness at Stanford that previously eluded him. Hoover had been unsure of his major before arriving at Stanford, but position working for geologist John Casper Branner convinced him to switch his major to geology, and Hoover interned for Branner and the United States Geological Survey during the summer. Though he was shy among fellow students at first, Hoover won election as student treasurer and became known for his distaste for fraternities and sororities. In his senior year, he became smitten with a classmate named Lou Henry, but his financial situation precluded the possibility of marriage. Hoover graduated from Stanford in 1895, {{in the midst of the}} Panic of 1893, and initially struggled to find a job.|$|E

500|$|The episodes {{themselves}} received varied {{responses from}} critics. Several were culled out as {{highlights of the}} series. [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus" [...] was heralded as a classic by several reviewers and was called the finest stand-alone episode produced by the series by another. The episode [...] "Bad Blood" [...] was praised by critics for its mix of horror and comedy. Dass called the episode [...] "an absolute gem" [...] and [...] "the most hilarious X-Files episode I have ever seen." [...] The episode has also appeared on various [...] "Best-Of" [...] lists of The X-Files. Other episodes fared worse. [...] "Schizogeny" [...] was derided by critics: The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff noted that the episode [...] "might <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> worst episode of The X-Files" [...] "Chinga", written by Stephen King, was criticized for having a poor story. Vitaris called the entry [...] "a major disappointment" [...] and wrote that it [...] "isn't scary in the least".|$|E
500|$|Ponzi {{described}} the machine as [...] "light-hearted [...] [...] [...] active, distinctive—and fun".

It has bells and whistles and other mechanized wonders that confirm rain sometime after the downpour and proudly announce sunshine in the bright light of day." [...] In 1994, The Oregonian reported that O'Donnell regarded Weather Machine with a [...] "mixture of wonder and embarrassment" [...] and stated that he [...] " [...] think it's all that attractive". The publication's Vivian McInerny said of O'Donnell and the machine: [...] "Practical people may wonder why the square needs such a silly weather machine when a glance out the window works as well[...] [...] And these practical people may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> ones who make the world go 'round. But it is the less practical people, the dreamers like O'Donnell, who make it worth going 'round." ...|$|E
500|$|Goya {{does not}} focus on {{the reasons for the}} shortage, nor does he {{apportion}} blame to any one party. Instead, he is concerned only with its effect on the population. Although the images in the group were based on the experience of Madrid, none of the scenes depict specific events, and there are no identifiable buildings to place the scenes. Goya's focus is on the darkened masses of dead and barely alive bodies, men carrying corpses of women, and bereaved children mourning for lost parents. Hughes believes , Madre infeliz! (Unhappy mother!), to be the most powerful and poignant of the group. He suggests that the space between the small girl sobbing and the corpse of her mother represents [...] "a darkness that seems to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> essence of loss and orphanhood". This group of plates was probably completed by early 1814. A scarcity of materials during the famine may have accounted for the freer application of aquatint in these prints; Goya was sometimes forced to use defective plates or reuse old plates after they were burnished.|$|E
