5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small <b>blisters</b> in groups often called cold sores or fever <b>blisters</b> or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form <b>blisters</b> that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the <b>blisters</b> appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E
5|$|Burns {{that affect}} only the {{superficial}} skin layers {{are known as}} superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without <b>blisters</b> and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends {{into some of the}} underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. <b>Blisters</b> are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.|$|E

40|$|Radial {{immunodiffusion}} is used {{to determine}} specific proteins in friction <b>blister</b> fluid and cantharidin <b>blister</b> fluid of human volunteers. Four proteins (albumin, fibrinogen, immunoglobin IgG and IgM) were determined in <b>blister</b> fluid pooled 2, 4 and 21 hours after <b>blistering.</b> The same proteins were also determined in cantharidin <b>blister</b> fluid from the back and palm. The concentration of a specific protein in friction <b>blister</b> fluid relative to the concentration in plasma is approximately the same for albumin, IgG and IgM while essentially no fibrinogen is found in this <b>blister</b> fluid. Relative concentrations of albumin, IgG and IgM are much larger in cantharidin <b>blister</b> fluid while {{a small amount of}} fibrinogen can be determined. This suggests that damage from cantharidin to epidermis and dermis is much more pronounced in the cantharidin <b>blister</b> than in the friction <b>blister.</b> It is also shown that fibrinogen is not destroyed by the friction <b>blister</b> fluid. Implications of the findings are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Fox {{ran with}} an unusual gait, as he was {{required}} to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time the springs in his artificial leg required to reset after each step. He found the training painful as the additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, <b>blisters</b> and intense pain. Fox found that after about 20minutes of each run, he crossed a pain threshold and the run became easier.|$|E
5|$|Other bite {{symptoms}} {{that may occur}} in humans include edema, which may become extensive, shock, watery blood oozing from the puncture wounds, nausea and vomiting, subcutaneous bruising, blood <b>blisters</b> that may form rapidly, and a painful swelling of the regional lymph nodes. Swelling usually decreases after a few days, except for the area immediately around the bite site. Hypotension, together with weakness, dizziness and periods of semi- or unconsciousness is also reported.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{has been}} using the same Össur blades since 2004. He was born without fibulae and with malformed feet, and his legs were amputated about halfway between knee and ankle so he could wear {{prosthetic}} legs. He wears socks and pads which are visible above the sockets to reduce chafing and to prevent <b>blisters,</b> and the sockets have straps in the front that can be tightened to make the prosthesis fit more snugly.|$|E
40|$|Total {{haemolytic}} complement {{was reduced}} in <b>blister</b> fluids of four pemphigus vulgaris patients {{when compared to}} serum complement levels and other serum and <b>blister</b> fluid proteins. Complement levels in most control <b>blister</b> fluids, on the other hand, more closely approached their corresponding serum levels. Haemolytic C 1, C 4, C 2, C 3 and C 5, measured in two pemphigus sera and <b>blister</b> fluids, were not measurable in one <b>blister</b> fluid and were extremely low in the second patient. C 3 proactivator (C 3 PA) was absent from both of these <b>blister</b> fluids. Three of the <b>blister</b> fluids exhibited anti-complementary activity when tested with normal human serum. By adding one <b>blister</b> fluid to normal human serum, inhibition of haemolytic C 1, C 2, C 3 and C 5 with conversion of C 3 and C 3 PA occurred. Activation of complement locally in pemphigus <b>blister</b> fluids would suggest a pathogenetic role for complement in this disease...|$|R

5|$|I {{examined}} Mr. Andrew Wilson on Feb. 15 & 16, 1982. He {{had multiple}} bruises, swellings and abrasions {{on his face}} and head. His right eye was battered and had a superficial laceration. Andrew Wilson had several linear <b>blisters</b> on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival at the Jail. There must be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.|$|E

5|$|Infection with {{smallpox}} {{is focused}} in small blood vessels {{of the skin}} and in the mouth and throat before disseminating. In the skin it results in a characteristic maculopapular rash and, later, raised fluid-filled <b>blisters.</b> V. major produced a more serious disease and had an overall mortality rate of 30–35 percent. V. minor caused a milder form of disease (also known as alastrim) which killed about 1 percent of those it infects. Long-term complications of V. major infection included characteristic scars, commonly on the face, which occur in 65–85 percent of survivors. Blindness resulting from corneal ulceration and scarring, and limb deformities due to arthritis and osteomyelitis were less common complications, seen in about 2–5 percent of cases.|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} forces {{operative in}} the fluid migration from the interstitial spaces into the <b>blister</b> cleft {{have not been}} directly measured until now. The colloid osmotic pressure and the total osmolality were determined in suction <b>blister</b> fluid after mild suction <b>blister</b> production by a modified “Dermovac” and in <b>blister</b> fluid of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous allergic contact dermatitis and pemphigus vulgaris and in the sera of healthy persons. The colloid osmotic pressure was measured {{by means of a}} recently developed osmometer with a semipermeable membrane between 2 chambers, one of them filled with Ringer solution, the other with the <b>blister</b> fluid or serum sample. The negative pressure in the first chamber was determined. The colloid osmotic pressure of suction <b>blister</b> fluid averages approximately 7 cm H 2 O, the values reach about 20 cm H 2 O in bullous diseases and about 38 cm H 2 O in the normal sera. The <b>blister</b> fluid colloid osmotic pressure has to rise to about 15 cm H 2 O or more to cause the fluid transport from the interstitial spaces of the surrounding tissue into the <b>blister</b> because of the negative interstitial fluid pressure and the colloid osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid. Otherwise the <b>blister</b> fluid is reabsorbed back into the interstitial spaces. The total osmolality does not differ in the serum and in the <b>blister</b> fluid. It {{does not seem to be}} etiologically connected with the fluid transport into the rising <b>blister...</b>|$|R
5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include immediate and intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes) by swelling and a tingling sensation. <b>Blisters</b> containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with tenderness and inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to the trunk, and with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{generally}} have little impact to human economic or social well-being, especially {{in comparison with}} insects, although locally {{they can be a}} nuisance or agricultural pest. Millipedes do not bite, and their defensive secretions are mostly harmless to humans — usually causing only minor discolouration on the skin — but the secretions of some tropical species may cause pain, itching, local erythema, edema, <b>blisters,</b> eczema, and occasionally cracked skin. Eye exposures to these secretions causes general irritation and potentially more severe effects such as conjunctivitis and keratitis. This is called millipede burn. First aid consists of flushing the area thoroughly with water; further treatment is aimed at relieving the local effects.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{smallpox}} generally {{produced a}} discrete rash, {{in which the}} pustules stood out on the skin separately. The distribution of the rash was densest on the face; denser on the extremities than on the trunk; and on the extremities, denser on the distal parts than on the proximal. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet {{were involved in the}} majority of cases. Sometimes, the <b>blisters</b> merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh. Patients with confluent smallpox often remained ill even after scabs have formed over all the lesions. In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62 percent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blister</b> packs are {{commonly}} used as unit-dose packaging for pharmaceutical tablets, capsules or lozenges. <b>Blister</b> packs can provide barrier protection for shelf life requirements, and a degree of tamper resistance. In the US, <b>blister</b> packs are mainly used for packing physician samples of drug products or for over-the-counter (OTC) products in the pharmacy. In {{other parts of the}} world, <b>blister</b> packs are the main packaging type since pharmacy dispensing and re-packaging are not common. A series of <b>blister</b> cavities is sometimes called a <b>blister</b> card or <b>blister</b> strip as well as <b>blister</b> pack. The difference between a strip pack and <b>blister</b> pack is that a strip pack does not have thermo-formed or cold formed cavities; the strip pack is formed around the tablet {{at a time when it}} is dropped to the sealing area between sealing moulds. In some parts of the world the pharmaceutical <b>blister</b> pack is known as a push-through pack (PTP), an accurate description of two key properties (i) the lidding foil is brittle, making it possible to press the product out while breaking the lidding foil and (ii) a semi-rigid formed cavity being sufficiently collapsible to be able to dispense the tablet or capsule by means of pressing it out with the thumb. Breaking the lidding foil with a fingernail for the appropriate tablet will make the pressing out easier.|$|R
40|$|Plasminogen {{activators}} produced locally in {{the skin}} have been implicated in <b>blistering</b> skin diseases. To explore whether plasminogen activators convert their substrate plasminogen into plasmin locally in the lesional skin we have analyzed the autoimmune <b>blistering</b> skin disease bullous pemphigoid. Enzyme activity was detected in bullous pemphigoid skin <b>blister</b> fluid by using a low molecular weight chromogenic substrate for plasmin. Enzyme activity was detected neither in suction <b>blister</b> fluid raised on normal skin nor in normal plasma. Immunoprecipitation or fractionation by molecular sieve chromatography of bullous pemphigoid skin <b>blister</b> fluid followed by testing in immunoassays disclosed putative plasmin/alpha 2 -macroglobulin complexes and plasmin/alpha 2 -antiplasmin complexes. Enzyme activity detected in bullous pemphigoid skin <b>blister</b> fluid by the low molecular weight chromogenic peptide assay was ascribed to the putative plasmin pha 2 -macroglobulin complexes. Because formation of plasmin-inhibitor complexes requires the active plasmin, our findings indicate previous activation of plasminogen to plasmin in skin lesions. There was no evidence for free plasmin (i. e., plasmin not complexed to inhibitors) in bullous pemphigoid <b>blister</b> fluid, suction <b>blister</b> fluid, or plasma...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we analyse the <b>blistered</b> {{function}} in wing vein development by studying genetic mosaics of mutant cells, genetic interactions with other genes affecting vein development and <b>blistered</b> expression in several mutant backgrounds. <b>blistered</b> encodes {{for a nuclear}} protein homologous to the mammalian Serum Response Factor and is expressed in presumptive intervein cells of third larval instar and pupal wing discs. Clones of <b>blistered</b> mutant cells proliferate normally but tend to grow along veins and always differentiate as vein tissue. These observations indicate that vein-determined wing cells show a particular behaviour {{that is responsible for}} their allocation to vein regions. We observe strong genetic interactions between <b>blistered,</b> veinlet and genes of the Ras signaling cascade. During disc proliferation, <b>blistered</b> expression is {{under the control of the}} Ras signal transduction pathway, but its expression is independent of veinlet. During the pupal period, <b>blistered</b> and veinlet expression become interdependent and mutually exclusive. These results link the activity of the Ras pathway to the process of early determination of intervein cells, by the transcriptional control of the <b>blistered</b> nuclear factor. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5|$|A pier at Port Aransas {{was largely}} {{destroyed}} {{at a cost}} of $10,000. The hurricane caused extensive damage to rice, cotton, and vegetable crops in the region. An estimate several days after the storm placed the total quantity of rice damaged at 500,000 bushels, totaling $10million in monetary losses. However, Zoch (1949) reported that total damage from the storm was $6.7 million. Following the storm, thousands of automobiles in six states were affected by widespread peeling and blistering paint. The <b>blisters,</b> usually concentrated on the hoods, fenders and tops of vehicles, contained a small amount of water, and peeling paint was also reported on one Shreveport home. Most of the cars damaged were parked outside, and sheltered automobiles were unaffected. Although total damage from the phenomenon may have reached thousands of dollars, experts were unable to identify its cause immediately following the storm. Two deaths were attributed to the storm: a resident of Port Neches who was electrocuted, and a young woman who drowned in Matagorda Bay.|$|E
5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage <b>blisters,</b> but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E
5|$|Herpetiform ulcers, (also termed {{stomatitis}} herpetiformis, or herpes-like ulcerations) is a subtype of aphthous stomatitis {{so named}} because the lesions resemble a primary infection with herpes simplex virus (primary herpetic gingivostomatitis). However, herpetiform ulceration is not caused by herpes viruses. As with all types of aphthous stomatitis, it is not contagious. Unlike true herpetic ulcers, herpetiforme ulcers are not preceded by vesicles (small, fluid filled <b>blisters).</b> Herpetiforme ulcers are less than 1mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time. Adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger, continuous areas of ulceration. Healing occurs within fifteen days without scarring. The ulceration may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized. Herpetiform ulceration is often extremely painful, and the lesions recur more frequently than minor or major aphthous ulcers. Recurrence may be so frequent that ulceration is virtually continuous. It generally occurs in a slightly older age group than the other subtypes, and females are affected slightly more frequently than males.|$|E

Spontaneous growth of the <b>blister</b> nucleus occurs through creep deformation of the surrounding aluminium due to the <b>blister</b> nucleus’ high internal gas pressure. This internal gas pressure also induces hydrogen precipitation {{in the form of}} micropores, which undergo steady growth in a spherical shell region around the <b>blister</b> nucleus.
