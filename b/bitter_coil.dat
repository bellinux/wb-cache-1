40|$|<b>Bitter</b> <b>coil</b> is an {{electromagnet}} {{used for}} the generation of exceptionally strong magnetic fields. The upper bound of magnet flux density is restricted by several factors. One principal restriction is the high stresses due to Lorentz forces in the coil. The Lorentz forces generate the distributed body force, which acts as the pressure of magnetic field. The common radial thickness profile of the <b>Bitter</b> <b>coil</b> is constant. In this paper the possibility of optimization by means of non-constant radial thickness profile of the <b>Bitter</b> <b>coil</b> is studied. The close form expression for optimal thickness profile is obtained. Both designs are compared and the considerable improvement of magnetic flux density is demonstrated. Moreover, the optimal design improves the shape of cooling channels. Namely, the highest cross-section of cooling channel is at the most thermally loaded inner surface of the coil...|$|E
40|$|A polyhelix magnet with a <b>Bitter</b> <b>coil</b> (duplex magnet) {{or with a}} {{superconducting coil}} (hybrid magnet) for the {{background}} field generation, is known to produce the highest magnetic fields. Numerical calculations involving system parameters established {{in the course of}} 1000 hours of operation of the Grenoble duplex magnet are used for designing the 30 T hybrid magnet. It is demonstrated that with a power of 10 MW continous magnetic fields of 30 T with a duplex magnet and 40 T with a hybrid magnet are feasible...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of three hybrid magnets has been conceived in this project. The smallest one now in operation {{is composed of}} a non-cryostable NbTi coil weighing 270 kg and a <b>Bitter</b> <b>coil</b> with a power of 3. 1 MW, producing 20 T field in a 32 mm diameter bore. The second one, 20 T in 52 mm at present, will produce 23 T when the power supply will be enlarged to 8 MW.

40|$|<b>Bitter</b> <b>coils</b> are {{electromagnets}} {{used for}} the generation of extremely strong magnetic fields superior to 30 [*]T. In this paper we calculate the mutual inductance and the magnetic force between <b>Bitter</b> disk (pancake) <b>coil</b> with the nonlinear radial current and the circular filamentary coil with the azimuthal current. The close form expressed over complete elliptic integrals {{of the first and}} second kind as well as Heuman’s Lambda function is obtained for this configuration either for the mutual inductance or for the magnetic force. The results of this method are compared with those obtained by the improved modified filament method for the presented configuration. All results are in an excellent agreement...|$|R
40|$|The final {{assembly}} of the Series Connected Hybrid magnet system for the Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin for Materials and Energy HZB has occurred with {{the integration of the}} superconducting cold mass, cryostat, resistive Florida <b>Bitter</b> <b>coils,</b> and the cryogenic, chilled water, power, and control subsystems. The hybrid magnet consists of a 13 T superconducting Nb 3 Sn CICC coil and a set of 12 T resistive, water cooled coils at 4. 4 MW. Much of the cryostat and cold mass functional requirements were dictated by the electromagnetic interactions between the superconducting and resistive coils. This includes the radial decentering and axial aligning forces from normal operations and a 1. 1 MN fault load. The system assembly was an international achievement with the cold mass being completed at the NHMFL in the USA, cryostat to cold mass interfaces made at Criotec Impianti in Italy, and {{final assembly}} at the HZB in German...|$|R
40|$|There exist {{a number}} of experiments/applications where the second {{dimension}} of the bore of Bitter magnets is not fully utilized. Using an analytical solution for elliptical bore coils, we show that reducing one of {{the dimensions of the}} bore can lead to considerable decrease in consumed power and/or coil material. The results of additional numerical computation show that a 20 % higher magnetic field can be achieved for an elliptical bore and racetrack bore coils with 1 : 10 ratio of the transverse dimensions of the bore than for a circular bore coil with the same larger transverse dimension of the bore, consumed power, and disk area.

40|$|Abstract. High {{cooling power}} of magnetocaloric {{refrigeration}} {{can be achieved}} only at large amounts of heat, which can be transferred in one cycle from cold end to hot end at quasi-isothermal conditions. The simple experimental method for direct measurement of the transferred heat from material with magnetocaloric effect (MCE) to massive nonmagnetic block at quasi-isothermal conditions was proposed. The vacuum calorimeter was designed for the simultaneous measurements of MCE both at adiabatic conditions (∆T) and quasi-isothermal conditions (∆Q) in the magnetic fields of <b>Bitter</b> <b>coil</b> magnet. This calorimeter was tested on samples of pure polycrystalline Gd with direct MCE. The maximal obtained values were ∆T = 17. 7 K and ∆Q = 5900 J/kg at initial temperature 20 0 C in magnetic field 140 kOe...|$|E
40|$|To capture pions the Neutrino Factory and Muon Collider Collaboration needs a {{field of}} {approx} 20 T {{throughout}} a cylinder 15 cm in diameter and 60 cm long, falling over the next 18 m to 1. 25 T, while the bore increases fourfold inversely as the square root of the field. We propose a hybrid system. The superconducting magnet is of world-class parameters, storing 600 MJ and including a coil to generate 14 T in a bore of {approx} 1. 3 m. Intercoil forces reach 100 MN. For high radiation resistance, the insert coil is of mineral-insulated hollow conductor, as developed for the Japan Hadron Facility; it would require 12 MW to generate 6 T. Needed is research to develop a more efficient hollow conductor or radiation-resistant insulator for a <b>Bitter</b> <b>coil...</b>|$|E
40|$|High {{cooling power}} of magnetocaloric {{refrigeration}} {{can be achieved}} only at large amounts of heat, which can be transferred in one cycle from cold end hot end at quasi-isothermal conditions. The simple and robust experimental method of direct measuring of the transferred heat of materials with magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in thermal contact with massive copper block with definite heat capacity in quasi-isothermal regime was proposed. The vacuum calorimeter for the specific transferred heat ΔQ and adiabatic temperature change ΔT measurements of MCE materials {{in the fields of}} <b>Bitter</b> <b>coil</b> magnet up to H = 140 kOe was designed and tested on samples of Ni 43 Mn 37. 9 In 12. 1 Co 7 Heusler alloy with inverse MCE in the vicinity of meta-magnetostructural phase transition (PT). It was found, that the magnetic field H = 80 kOe produces complete PT from martensite to austenite with ΔQ = - 1600 J/kg at initial temperature 273 K...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{cooling system}} for the muon collider will consist of a 200 meter long line of alternating field straight solenoids interspersed with bent solenoids. The muons are cooled in all directions using a 400 mm long section liquid hydrogen at high field. The muons are accelerated in the forward direction by about 900 mm long, 805 MHz RF cavities in a gradient field that goes from 6 T to - 6 T in about 300 mm. The high field section in the channel starts out at an induction of about 2 T in the hydrogen. As the muons proceed down the cooling channel, the induction in the liquid hydrogen section increases to inductions as high as 30 T. The diameter of the liquid hydrogen section starts at 750 mm when the induction is 2 T. As the induction in the cooling section goes up, {{the diameter of the}} liquid hydrogen section decreases. When the high field induction is 30 T, the diameter of the liquid hydrogen section is about 80 mm. When the high field solenoid induction is below 8. 5 T or 9 T, niobium titanium coils are proposed for generating. the magnetic field. Above 8. 5 T or 9 T to about 20 T, graded niobium tin and niobium titanium coils would be used at temperatures down to 1. 8 K. Above 20 T, a graded bybrid magnet system is proposed, where the high field magnet section (above 20 T) is either a conventional water cooled coil section or a water cooled <b>Bitter</b> type <b>coil.</b> Two types of superconducting coils have been studied.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{foundation is}} laid {{for a relatively}} new type of magnets generating uniform transverse field - tilted coil magnets. These consist of concentric nested solenoidal coils with elliptical turns tilted at a certain angle to the central axis and current flowing in opposite directions in the coils tilted at opposite angles, generating a perfectly uniform transverse field. Both superconducting wire-wound and resistive Bitter tilted coils are discussed. An original analytical method is used {{to prove that the}} wire-wound tilted coils have the ideal distribution of the axial linear current density - "cosine-theta". Magnetic fields are calculated for a tilted <b>Bitter</b> <b>coil</b> magnet using an original exact solution for current density in an elliptical Bitter disk. Superconducting wire-wound tilted coil magnets may become an alternative for traditional dipole magnets for accelerators, and Bitter tilted coil magnets are attractive for rotation experiments with a large access port perpendicular to the field.

40|$|Measurements of the {{adiabatic}} {{temperature change}} (ΔT) {{and the specific}} heat transfer (ΔQ) of Ni 2. 18 Mn 0. 82 Ga Heusler alloy were taken in order to quantify the direct giant magnetocaloric effect of the alloy when {{it is in the}} vicinity of magneto-structural phase transition (PT) from paramagnetic austenite to ferromagnetic martensite, and their results are presented. A new vacuum calorimeter was used to simultaneously measure ΔT and ΔQ of magnetocaloric materials with a <b>Bitter</b> <b>coil</b> magnet in fields of up to H[*]=[*] 140 kOe. Other thermomagnetic properties of this alloy were investigated using standard differential scanning calorimetry and PPMS equipment. The maximal values of magnetocaloric effect in H[*]=[*] 140 kOe were found to be ΔT[*]=[*] 8. 4 [*]K at initial temperature 340 [*]K and ΔQ[*]=[*] 4900 [*]J/kg at 343 [*]K. Using this direct method, we show that the alloy indeed demonstrates the largest value of ΔQ as compared with previously published results for direct measurements of magnetocaloric materials, even though at 140 kOe the magnetic field-induced magnetostructural PT is still not complete.

40|$|We {{have studied}} narrow anticrossing signals in 3 He which have no {{equivalent}} in 4 He {{because they are}} due to the conjonction of fine and hyperfine interactions. High precision results are obtained {{by the use of}} a high homogeneity <b>Bitter</b> <b>coil</b> driven by NMR. The experimental signals obtained are in perfect agreement with the predictions deduced from an entire diagonalization of the 3 He Breit hamiltonian restricted to the (Is, nd) configuration. The values used for the radial constants are deduced from an analysis of previous experimental results obtained by various authors on 4 He and 3 He. These values are found to differ from the hydrogenic ones by less than 1 %. We have determined : first the singlet-triplet spin-orbit coupling constant for the 31 - 3 D states : a(3 D) = 650 ± 1 MHz and secondly the singlet-triplet separation of nD states (n = 3 to 6) with a precision of up to 5 x 10 - 5 in relative value. An unexpectedly large (∼ 10 - 3), negative isotope shift is found compared to the equivalent 4 He values, presumably due to a slight configuration interaction induced by a hyperfine interaction...|$|E
40|$|We propose several methodologies {{to study}} and {{optimize}} the electromagnetic process for Electromagnetic Forming (EMF) and Welding (EMW), thereby lowering the necessary process energy up to a factor of three and lengthening the life-time of EMW compression coils. We present a new theoretical approach to calculate a so-called critical kinetic energy to achieve a proper EMW joint, which {{is related to the}} volume of the accelerated mass and the Vicker's Hardness of the material. Using this novel approach, welding windows for several materials are presented. Studying the circuit theory, the current discharge pulse can be optimized {{to the needs of the}} EMW process, when opting for a critically damped RLC circuit. We present MultiSIM and MATLAB models that prove the proposed optimization and reflect the experimental EMW setup and parameters. Using the models, unknown parameters, such as machine inductance and resistance can be extrapolated for EMF and EMW machinery. Furthermore, the MATLAB model can calculate the optimal gap between the outer and inner workpiece for the outer workpiece to reach the maximum velocity at impact. Good correlation was found with regards to the High-Speed Videography used to study the EMF process in further detail measuring velocities between 50 m/s and 100 m/s. Studying the mechanical properties of the outer workpiece we propose an EMF-EMW setup that would decrease the strength of the outer workpiece by introducing a controlled amount of wrinkles through an EMF step with a mandrel inside the outer workpiece, followed by a lower critical energy EMW step. (cont.) Through a failure study, accompanied by a metallurgical analysis, of an Aluminum Bronze <b>Bitter</b> <b>coil</b> we present a materials selection of other possible coil materials, as well as a new method called Electromagnetic Fatigue (EMFA) Analysis to study the crack initiation and propagation in electromagnetic high-current applications. Finally, through two sets of EMW experiments tubular lap joints that were stronger than the base material could be produced and the EMW process parameters of increased cleanliness, gap, wall thickness and a lower taper angle, for the case of our setup, showed to increase the final joint strength. by Daniel G.
