5|$|Construction, {{such as the}} North-South Arterial Highway project, {{supports}} the public-sector job market. Although passenger and commercial traffic on the Erie Canal has declined greatly since the 19thcentury, the barge canal still allows heavy cargo to travel through Utica at low cost, <b>bypassing</b> <b>the</b> New York State Thruway and providing intermodal freight transport with the railroads.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, the Round Lake Diversion was constructed, <b>bypassing</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} route of Highway11 from south of Tarzwell {{to the present}} day junction with Highway66. The original route was designated as Highway112 upon completion of the diversion in 1953.|$|E

5|$|Highway127 was {{designated}} in late 1955, generally {{following the same}} route as today, {{with the exception of}} the northern terminus. During the early 1960s, a new road was constructed east of Whitney, <b>bypassing</b> <b>the</b> old highway for several kilometres. By 1963, the bypass was complete and Highway127 was rerouted onto it.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the other}} issues {{involving}} Hamilton were <b>bypassing</b> <b>the</b> rising issue of slavery in Congress after Quakers petitioned for its abolition (though {{he returned to the}} issue the following year), Duer having resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and the vote of assumption being voted down 31 votes to 29 on April 12.|$|E
50|$|US 2 {{runs through}} the city. US 85 <b>bypasses</b> <b>the</b> city to the northwest, US 85B <b>bypasses</b> <b>the</b> city to the northeast. ND 1804 {{runs through the}} {{southern}} portion {{of the city and}} is concurrent with US 2 between 143rd Avenue, and 2nd Street.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, {{construction}} {{began on}} a bypass route for PA 100 and US 222 around Trexlertown. On September 29, 2005, PA 100 was rerouted to <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> {{community to the}} west along the four-lane divided Trexlertown <b>Bypass.</b> <b>The</b> former alignment through Trexlertown became known as Trexlertown Road, which is designated SR 6100. US 222 was moved onto <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> on September 28, 2007 following the extension of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> east to allow US 222 to <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> community. <b>The</b> <b>bypass</b> cost $144 million to build. In 1988, plans were made to <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> section of PA 100 through Eagle which was narrow and suffered from traffic congestion. A <b>bypass</b> to <b>the</b> east of the community was proposed as opposed to adding turn lanes along the existing route as the latter would have required the demolition of several buildings. <b>The</b> Eagle <b>Bypass</b> was delayed for years by funding issues. Construction on <b>the</b> Eagle <b>Bypass</b> was slated to begin in 2003. <b>The</b> <b>bypass</b> was completed between Byers Road and PA 100 north of Eagle in fall 2005. The remainder of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> south to PA 100 south of Eagle was completed on August 19, 2009. <b>The</b> <b>bypass</b> was called Graphite Mine Road and is designated as SR 1055. PA 100 continues to follow Pottstown Pike {{through the center of}} Eagle.|$|R

5|$|The {{opening of}} the Saddledome allowed Calgary to play host to major musical acts that were <b>bypassing</b> <b>the</b> city in the early 1980s, because the city's {{existing}} facilities were not {{large enough to accommodate}} the industry's top performers.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsins next {{operation}} was {{to assist with}} the occupation of Luzon. <b>Bypassing</b> <b>the</b> southern beaches, American amphibious forces went ashore at Lingayen Gulf, the scene of initial Japanese assaults to take Luzon nearly three years before.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2015, {{work began}} on <b>bypassing</b> <b>the</b> 1960s {{interchange}} with US23 near Brighton. A {{new set of}} through lanes was built on I-96 between the current eastbound and westbound lanes with three new bridges over northbound and southbound US23, and over Old US23. The existing lanes of I-96 were changed to be collector-distributor lanes for ramp traffic. This project was completed in November 2016.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> idea of <b>bypasses</b> predates <b>the</b> use {{of motor}} vehicles. The first (northern) London <b>bypass,</b> <b>the</b> present Marylebone Road between Paddington and Islington, {{was started in}} 1756.|$|R
50|$|On the Vorma, {{south of}} Eidsvoll, lies the Svanfoss {{where the water}} level in Lake Mj√∏sa is regulated. A 6 by 60 m lock, which <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> Svanfoss, lifting boats 3 m to allow <b>the</b> <b>bypassing</b> of <b>the</b> fall, opened in 1906.|$|R
50|$|In February 2010, the Tasmanian Government {{approved}} {{the construction of}} the 2.8 km Kingston <b>Bypass.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bypass</b> includes <b>the</b> Summerleas Road underpass, Algona Road roundabout and dedicated cycle lanes.|$|R
5|$|Damage to the {{crossing}} {{resulted in the}} closure of the QEW until a temporary bridge was erected. To remedy what was becoming a major delay and hazard, the Department of Highways began planning a high-level bridge to cross the shipping channel. To provide better access to the new structure as well as the proposed Chedoke Expressway, construction began on the Freeman Diversion, <b>bypassing</b> <b>the</b> old trumpet interchange and creating a new three-level stack. Work on both proceeded over the next six years.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fran rapidly tracked {{towards the}} {{northeast}} {{in response to}} an area of low pressure within the westerlies. By October11, the hurricane attained its peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) and its lowest barometric pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg) after <b>bypassing</b> <b>the</b> Azores islands. Situated over exceedingly cold waters, Fran transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on October12 as it neared the French coastline. Shortly before reaching land, the system was absorbed by a cold front. Throughout its existence, Fran had little effect on land.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 an {{environmental}} study into building a freeway to freeway interchange in Gila Bend from SR 85 to I-8 {{was completed by}} ADOT and the Federal Highway Administration. The study found no {{significant impact on the}} local environment and outlined a finalized full freeway standard design, <b>bypassing</b> <b>the</b> I-8 Business/Maricopa Road intersection SR 85 currently traverses through. A diamond interchange Exit 121 is planned at Maricopa Road/I-8 Business along with a second diamond interchange slightly northeast of the proposed Exit 121.|$|E

5|$|The parkway {{was opened}} in 2001 after just under {{a year of}} {{construction}} and almost two decades of community requests. Local residents led by Doug and Bruce Stephens urged the state to connect I-84 directly to Adams Avenue, <b>bypassing</b> <b>the</b> congested US-89. Then-governor Mike Leavitt suggested that a private company rather than the state would need to build the road.|$|E
5|$|The {{planners}} then examined {{whether a}} commando force was feasible {{to accomplish the}} task. An unusually high spring tide was due in March 1942 which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, <b>bypassing</b> <b>the</b> heavily defended dredged channel. The approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship, but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through.|$|E
