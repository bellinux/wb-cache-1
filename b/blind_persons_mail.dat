40|$|At present many blind assistive {{systems have}} been {{implemented}} {{but there is no}} such kind of good system to navigate a <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> and also to track the movement of a <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> and rescue him/her if he/she is lost. In this paper, we have presented a blind assistive and tracking embedded system. In this system the <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> is navigated through a spectacle interfaced with an android application. The <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> is guided through Bengali/English voice commands generated by the application according to the obstacle position. Using voice command a <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> can establish voice call to a predefined number without touching the phone just by pressing the headset button. The blind assistive application gets the latitude and longitude using GPS and then sends them to a server. The movement of the <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> is tracked through another android application that points out the current position in Google map. We took distances from several surfaces like concrete and tiles floor in our experiment where the error rate is 5 %.

This <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> had an eyeball on each palm of the hand, and these eyes {{seemed to be looking}} for something. The traveler ran away out of surprise, and rushed into an inn. After telling the owner of the inn what had happened, the owner answered that {{in a certain}} place a few days ago, a <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> was killed and robbed by a scoundrel, and the <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> wanted to have at least one look at the face of those scoundrels, if not with regular eyes, at least with eyes on the hands, and this grievence led the <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> to become a [...] "tenome" [...] yōkai, and similarly in Echigo, it is said that a tenome had appeared after a blind man was killed.|$|R

40|$|To {{successfully}} navigate in {{an indoor}} environment, a <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> {{must be able}} to detect low and mid-height obstacles, as well as stairs. The most common tool that blind people currently use to navigate is the standard white cane. Therefore, we decided to modify and enhance a walking cane, since blind people already are comfortable with it. The standard white cane is only able to detect objects by touch. The blind user sweeps the cane back and forth in front of them. If the cane runs into an object or falls off of the edge of a stair, the <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> becomes aware of the obstacle – too late. We wanted to provide additional feedback to the <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> to warn them of objects before they run into them. We accomplished this goal by adding infrared and sonar sensors to the cane that provided information about the environment to the <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> through tactile- auditory feedback. ...|$|R

50|$|Suffering from {{blindness}} affects {{not only}} the <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> but also members of his/her family. Where there are few paved roads and where terrain is rugged and mountainous, a <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> has incredible difficulty moving around and depends on a caretaker. There are no social services available to the blind, and individuals who are blind cannot contribute to family income. A <b>blind</b> <b>person,</b> unable to care for themselves in such a harsh environment requires a help of a family member, which essentially takes two people out {{of being able to}} contribute to family income, or community life. With sight restored, many patients would be able to return to work and to traditional roles in their families and societies.|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{research}} shows that <b>blind</b> <b>persons</b> who have the ability and opportunity to access geographic map information tactually, benefit in their mobility. Unfortunately, tangible maps are not found in large numbers. Economics is the leading explanation: tangible maps are expensive to build, duplicate and distribute. SAM, short for Spatial Auditory Map, is a prototype created to address the unavail- ability of tangible maps. SAM presents geographic information to a <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> encoded in sound. A <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> receives maps electronically and accesses them using a small in- expensive digitalizing tablet connected to a PC. The interface provides location-dependent sound as a stylus is manipulated by the user, plus a schematic visual representation for users with residual vision. The assessment of SAM {{on a group of}} blind participants suggests that blind users can learn unknown environments as complex as the ones represented by tactile maps - in the same amount of reading time. This research opens new avenues in visualization techniques, promotes alternative communication methods, and proposes a human-computer interaction framework for conveying map information to a <b>blind</b> <b>person...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} {{barriers in}} utilisation of community based rehabilitation (CBR) services for incurably <b>blind</b> <b>persons</b> in rural South India. Methods: A community-based rehabilitation programme for incurably <b>blind</b> <b>persons</b> was initiated in Theni district of southern Tamil Nadu in south India. After door-to-door enumeration and preliminary ocular screening by trained {{workers at the}} village, identified <b>blind</b> <b>persons</b> were categorised as either curable or incurable by an ophthalmologist. Trained workers provided rehabilitation, including mobility training (OM), training to perform {{activities of daily living}} (ADL), and economic rehabilitation for the incurably blind in their respective villages. Results: Of the 460, 984 persons surveyed, 400 (0. 09 &#x 0025;) were certified as incurably blind including 156 (39. 00 &#x 0025;) <b>persons</b> <b>blind</b> from birth. Social rehabilitation was provided for 268 (67. 00 &#x 0025;) incurably <b>blind</b> <b>persons.</b> Economic rehabilitation was provided to 96 persons, and integrated education to 22 children. Nearly one-fifth (n= 68, 17. 00 &#x 0025;) of incurably <b>blind</b> <b>persons</b> refused the services provided. The major reasons for refusal included old age and other illnesses (41. 18 &#x 0025;), and multiple handicaps (19. 12 &#x 0025;). Twenty-seven (6. 75 &#x 0025;) persons had either migrated or died, and 29 (7. 25 &#x 0025;) persons were already able to function independently. Conclusion: Although CBR programmes provide useful services to the incurably blind, a better understanding of barriers is required to improve service utilisation. Developing a standardised data collection format for every CBR programme can result {{in the creation of a}} national database of ophthalmic diseases...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Navigation for {{visually}} impaired people needs to exploit more approaches for solving problems it has, especially in image based methods navigation. Approach: This study introduces {{a new approach}} of an electronic cane for navigation through the environment. By forming multi clouds of SIFT features for the scene objects in the environment using some considerations. Results: The system gives an efficient localization within the weighted topological graph. Instead of building a metric (3 D) model of the environment, it helps the <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> to navigate more confidently. The work efforts towards conceptualizing environment {{on the basis of}} the human compatible representation so formed. Such representation and the resulting conceptualization would be useful for enabling <b>blind</b> <b>persons</b> to be cognizant of their surroundings. The identification of different scenes to the <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> has done by clouds of three or two objects. These clouds grouped the stored objects into meaningful groups used in localization of a cane with single web camera as an external sensor. Conclusion: The approach is useful to divide the space environment into meaning partitions and helps to detect sites and objects needed from the <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> in very sufficient way with in the map...|$|R
