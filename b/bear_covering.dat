25|$|Amboró National Park {{in central}} Bolivia is a nature reserve with over 912 species of birds, over 177 {{mammalian}} species including puma, ocelot, and the rare spectacled <b>bear.</b> <b>Covering</b> {{an area of}} 4,425km² (1,709 sq mi), it is protected from human settlements, hunting, mining and deforestation, though problems with all these still exist within the park. The Carrasco National Park is placed adjacent to Amboró, and together the two form a larger conservation unit.|$|E

5000|$|In February, {{two events}} {{traditionally}} {{take place at}} Prats: the Fête de l'ours (in Catalan : Festa de l'Ós, i.e. bear festival) and Carnaval. Both are full of fascinating traditions handed down over the years. During the Bear Festival, celebrated annually {{at the beginning of}} spring, the locals dress up as <b>bears,</b> <b>covering</b> themselves with soot or coal and oil, and [...] "attacking" [...] the onlookers, attempting to get everyone dirty. Others dress up as hunters, playing the role of [...] "protectors". The festival ends with the [...] "ball de l'os (bear dance). There is a reference to this tradition in the Catalan author Joan-Lluís Lluís' novel El dia de l'ós (The Day of the Bear).|$|R
5000|$|Most {{parts of}} the plant are covered in a dense indumentum of very short, [...] white hairs. However, the {{underside}} of the lamina <b>bears</b> a dense <b>covering</b> of long hairs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of the indumentum is variable in this species. Some plants are completely , while others <b>bear</b> a <b>covering</b> of orange to brown hairs (≤1 mm long) on the stem, pitchers, tendrils, and portions of the inflorescence. Developing rosette pitchers and tendrils are often densely , while developing pitchers produced on the climbing stem are [...] The pitcher lid may be glabrous or pubescent. The peduncle is typically slightly pubescent, and the partial peduncles, pedicels, bracts, tepals, and androphores densely pubescent.|$|R
5000|$|Fieldia is a genus of worm {{known from}} the Cambrian Burgess Shale, and {{assigned}} to the Priapulids.It was originally interpreted as an arthropod; its trunk <b>bears</b> a dense <b>covering</b> of spines, and its proboscis is small. [...] It fed on sea-floor mud, evidenced by the frequent presence of sediments preserved in its gut.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Wolf - real name: Sergeant Jake Mendez (played by John Leguizamo) is {{a veteran}} of the War in Iraq. He served 15 years in the United States Marine Corps, had three tours of duty during the war, and <b>bears</b> {{numerous}} scars <b>covering</b> his body from injuries sustained therein. He has a 16-year-old son who is a heroin addict; his wife died in 2006.|$|R
50|$|The {{stem and}} lamina have a sparse indumentum of simple white hairs. Short, {{branched}} reddish-brown hairs line {{the margins of}} the lamina. The outer surfaces of the pitchers <b>bear</b> a sparse <b>covering</b> of short, branched red hairs. The same hairs are more densely present on {{the margins of the}} lid and upper part of the pitcher directly below the peristome. Immature inflorescences have an indumentum of short white and red hairs throughout.|$|R
50|$|Bentham {{began his}} radio {{career as a}} {{volunteer}} at Dudley Hospital Radio in the West Midlands. His first professional broadcasting role was presenting Weekend Overnights at Wolverhampton's Classic Gold WABC. He then worked at Stratford-upon-Avon's The <b>Bear</b> 102 <b>covering</b> as many shifts as he could fit in. He began presenting the Weekday Breakfast Show in January 2001 and was their flagship presenter until March 2005.Bentham was recruited as Weekday Breakfast Presenter for BBC Hereford and Worcester in April 2005 and presented the show until October 2014 making him the longest serving Weekday Breakfast Presenter in the station's history. In addition he regularly covered Worcestershire County Cricket Club games {{as part of the}} station's ball-by-ball commentary team.Bentham joined BBC Radio Oxford in November 2014 hosting their Mid-Morning Show. Bentham was replaced at breakfast by Elliott Webb.|$|R
5000|$|All mature {{vegetative}} {{parts are}} , but a [...] indumentum is present on some developing structures. Young {{parts of the}} stem <b>bear</b> a sparse <b>covering</b> of reddish-brown, basally branched hairs (0.2-0.5 mm long). A dense indumentum of reddish-brown hairs (0.5-1 mm long) is present on developing pitchers and tendril ends. The inflorescence bears branched, yellowish-brown hairs measuring 0.5-1 mm in length. Tepals have a dense covering of curved, reddish-brown hairs (around 0.2 mm long) along their margins. Ovaries also have a dense covering of reddish-brown hairs, but these are longer, measuring 0.5-1 mm.|$|R
60|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the jungle was its thorniness. The shrubs were thorny; the creepers were thorny; the bamboos even were thorny. Everything grew zigzag and jagged, and in an inextricable tangle, so that {{to get through the}} bush with gun or net or even spectacles, was generally not to be done, and insect-catching in such localities was out of the question. It was in such places that the Pittas often lurked, and when shot it became a matter of some difficulty to secure the bird, and seldom without a heavy payment of pricks and scratches and torn clothes could the prize be won. The dry volcanic soil and arid climate seem favourable to the production of such stunted and thorny vegetation, for the natives assured me that this was nothing to the thorns and prickles of Sumbawa whose surface still <b>bears</b> the <b>covering</b> of volcanic ashes thrown out forty years ago by the terrible eruption of Tomboro.|$|R
50|$|Colonies of Electra pilosa form broad mats or star-shaped {{patches on}} the surface of the fronds of large algae such as Laminaria and Fucus serratus. The zooids also grows in small patches or tufts {{on the surface}} of shells and stones, and {{encircling}} the fronds of red algae such as Mastocarpus stellatus. The zooids are packed closely together, are cylindrical and about 0.5 by 0.3 mm. Each one has a mineralized exoskeleton with a transparent, membranous oval window. The calcified protective <b>covering</b> <b>bears</b> about nine spines (four to twelve), the central one being much longer than the others, giving the colony a hairy (Latin pilosa) appearance.|$|R
60|$|I send a {{duplicate}} of this {{note to the}} Haymarket, in case it should miss you out of town. For a few years I have been liable, at wholly uncertain and incalculable times, to a severe attack of neuralgia in the foot, about once {{in the course of}} a year. It began in an injury to the finer muscles or nerves, occasioned by over-walking in the deep snow. When it comes on I cannot stand, and can <b>bear</b> no <b>covering</b> whatever on the sensitive place. One of these seizures is upon me now. Until it leaves me I could no more walk into St. James's Hall than I could fly in the air. I hope you will present my duty to the Prince of Wales, and assure his Royal Highness that nothing short of my being (most unfortunately) disabled for the moment would have prevented my attending, as trustee of the Fund,[110] at the dinner, and warmly expressing my poor sense of the great and inestimable service his Royal Highness renders to a most deserving institution by so kindly commending it to the public.|$|R
40|$|The rat gene {{encoding}} the microphthalmia-associated {{transcription factor}} (Mitf) {{was assigned to}} rat Chromosome (Chr) 4 q 34 -q 41, {{as well as the}} Gata 2 and Mem 1 genes. Rat Chr 4 is homologous to mouse Chr 6 and human Chr 3, which carry the Mitf (MITF) gene in these species (MMU 6, 40. 0 cM, and HSA 3 p 14. 1 -p 12. 3). mib/mib rats, which are characterized by depigmentation, microphtalmy, osteopetrosis, and neurological disorders were shown to <b>bear</b> a deletion <b>covering</b> several kilobases of genomic DNA in the Mitf gene and to lack Mitf mRNA. The Mitf mutation in the mib/mib rats is thus very likely to be a Mitf null mutation, causing a phenotype similar to the one observed in the miVGA- 9 mice, but including osteopetrosis as an additional feature.

50|$|Despite {{its small}} size, Cyprus has {{a variety of}} natural vegetation. This {{includes}} forests of conifers and broadleaved trees such as Pinus brutia, cedar, cypresses and oaks. Ancient authors write that most of Cyprus, even Messaoria, was heavily forested, and there are still considerable forests on the Troodos and Kyrenia ranges, and locally at lower altitudes. About 17% of the whole island is classified as woodland. Where there is no forest, tall shrub communities of golden oak (Quercus alnifolia), strawberry tree (Arbutus andrachne), terebinth (Pistacia terebinthus), olive (Olea europaea), kermes oak (Quercus coccifera) and styrax (Styrax officinalis) are found, but such maquis is uncommon. Over most of the island untilled ground <b>bears</b> a grazed <b>covering</b> of garrigue, largely composed of low bushes of Cistus, Genista sphacelata, Calycotoime villosa, Lithospermum hispidulum, Phaganalon rupestre and, locally, Pistacia lentiscus. Where grazing is excessive this covering is soon reduced, and an impoverished batha remains, consisting principally of Thymus capitatus, Sarcopoterium spinosum, and a few stunted herbs.|$|R
500|$|During the day, {{the yellow}} {{stingray}} is fairly inactive and spends much time buried under {{a thin layer}} of sediment or lying motionless in vegetation. Tracking studies have shown that it generally remains within a small home range of around , with individuals covering only a portion of the entire area on any particular day. It favors the boundaries between different terrain, such as sand and reef. Its periscopic eyes give it a 360° panoramic view of its surroundings; each eye <b>bears</b> an elaborate <b>covering</b> or [...] "operculum" [...] that allows fine control over the amount of light entering the pupil. Therefore, the resting ray is well equipped to detect approaching predators, which may potentially include any large carnivorous fish such as the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). The yellow stingray is most sensitive to sounds of 300–600Hertz, which is fairly typical among sharks and rays that have been investigated thus far. It and other stingrays have a large brain relative to other rays, comprising around 1–2% of the body weight.|$|R
40|$|Vancouver and British Columbia {{is still}} giddy with the astounding {{success of our}} Canadian athletes. The events and the athleticisms shown were nothing short of remarkable, and athletes that didn’t {{step up to the}} podium still {{performed}} blazingly well. Consider the 50 km biathlon; the convergence of physical elitism where the separation between first place and fourth was a mere 1. 5 seconds after more than two hours of racing, a difference of less than two per mil. At the same time the technology associated with the games was breathtaking. Apparently more people accessed the games than ever before via conventional means, but also over mobile media {{in a way that will}} likely change how games are broadcast and accessed from this point forth. I find myself constantly amazed by technological advances in all walks of life, including geoscience. The European based Maxwave project for example, which has documented the presence of rogue waves using satellite <b>borne</b> radar <b>covering</b> large swaths of ocean. The second, hydrologic models are arguably more like the mystery whereby they become potentially more revealing, but also harder to use and interpret with every new complex algorithm. The second article considers the applicability of several hydrologic models to forest management issues in BC that will hopefully bring users closer to a usable understanding of those models. In either case, as technology trickles down into the hands of users, it behooves us to take notice. I hope these articles help somewhat.
