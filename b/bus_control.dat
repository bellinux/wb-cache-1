40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} the {{transient}} {{performance of a}} multi-terminal high-voltage DC (MTDC) grid equipped with a slack <b>bus</b> for voltage <b>control</b> to that of two distributed control schemes: a standard droop controller and a distributed averaging proportional-integral (DAPI) controller. We evaluate performance {{in terms of an}} H 2 metric that quantifies expected deviations from nominal voltages, and show that the transient performance of a droop or DAPI controlled MTDC grid is always superior to that of an MTDC grid with a slack bus. In particular, by studying systems built up over lattice networks, we show that the H 2 norm of a slack <b>bus</b> <b>controlled</b> system may scale unboundedly with network size, while the norm remains uniformly bounded with droop or DAPI control. We simulate the control strategies on radial MTDC networks to demonstrate that the transient performance for the slack <b>bus</b> <b>controlled</b> system deteriorates significantly as the network grows, which is not the case with the distributed control strategies.

40|$|Developing public {{transportation}} and giving priority to buses is a feasible solution {{for improving the}} level of {{public transportation}} service, which facilitates congestion alleviation and prevention, and contributes to urban development and city sustainability. This paper presents a novel <b>bus</b> operation <b>control</b> strategy including both holding control and speed control to improve the level of service of transit systems within a connected vehicle environment. Most previous work focuses on optimization of signal timing to decrease the bus signal delay by assuming that holding control is not applied; the speed of buses is given as a constant input and the acceleration and deceleration processes of buses can be neglected. This paper explores {{the benefits of a}} <b>bus</b> operation <b>control</b> strategy to minimize the total cost, which includes bus signal delay, bus holding delay, bus travel delay, acceleration cost due to frequent stops and intense driving. A set of formulations are developed to explicitly capture the interaction between <b>bus</b> holding <b>control</b> and speed control. Experimental analysisand simulation tests have shown that the proposed integrated operational model outperforms the traditional control, speed control only, or holding control only strategies in terms of reducing the total cost of buses. The sensitivity analysis has further demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the proposed approach to be applied in a real-time <b>bus</b> operation <b>control</b> system under different levels of traffic demand, bus stop locations, and speed limits...|$|R

5000|$|The 8085 is a {{conventional}} von Neumann design {{based on the}} Intel 8080. Unlike the 8080 it does not multiplex state signals onto the data bus, but the 8-bit data bus is instead multiplexed with the lower 8-bits of the 16-bit address bus {{to limit the number}} of pins to 40. State signals are provided by dedicated <b>bus</b> <b>control</b> signal pins and two dedicated bus state ID pins named S0 and S1. Pin 40 is used for the power supply (+5 V) and pin 20 for ground. Pin 39 is used as the Hold pin. The processor was designed using nMOS circuitry, and the later [...] "H" [...] versions were implemented in Intel's enhanced nMOS process called HMOS ("High-performance MOS"), originally developed for fast static RAM products. Only a single 5 volt power supply is needed, like competing processors and unlike the 8080. The 8085 uses approximately 6,500 transistors.|$|E
5000|$|Beta mode {{is based}} on 8B/10B (from Gigabit Ethernet, also used for many other protocols). 8B/10B {{encoding}} involves expanding an 8 bit data word into 10 bits, with the extra bits after the 5th and 8th data bits. The partitioned data is sent through a Running Disparity calculator function. The Running Disparity calculator attempts to keep the number of 1s transmitted equal to 0s, thereby assuring a DC-balanced signal. Then, the different partitions are sent through a 5B/6B encoder for the 5 bit partition and a 3B/4B encoder for the 3 bit partition. This gives the packet the ability {{to have at least}} two 1s, ensuring synchronization of the PLL at the receiving end to the correct bit boundaries for reliable transfer. An additional function of the coding scheme is to support the arbitration for bus access and general <b>bus</b> <b>control.</b> This is possible due to the [...] "surplus" [...] symbols afforded by the 8B/10B expansion. (While 8-bit symbols can encode a maximum of 256 values, 10-bit symbols permit the encoding of up to 1024.) Symbols invalid for {{the current state of the}} receiving PHY indicate data errors.|$|E
5000|$|The 8087 {{differed}} from subsequent Intel coprocessors {{in that it}} was directly connected to the address and data buses. The 8087 looked for instructions that commenced with the '11011' sequence and acted on them, immediately requesting DMA from the main CPU as necessary to access memory operands longer than one word (16 bits), then immediately releasing <b>bus</b> <b>control</b> back to the main CPU. The coprocessor did not hold up execution of the program until the coprocessor instruction was complete, and the program had to explicitly synchronize the two processors, as explained above (in the [...] "Design and development" [...] section). There was a potential crash problem if the coprocessor instruction failed to decode to one that the coprocessor understood. Intel's later coprocessors did not connect to the buses in the same way, but received instructions through the main processor via I/O ports. This yielded an execution time penalty, but the potential crash problem was avoided because the main processor would ignore the instruction if the coprocessor refused to accept it. The 8087 was able to detect whether it was connected to an 8088 or an 8086 by monitoring the data bus during the reset cycle.|$|E
