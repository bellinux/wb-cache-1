5|$|September 25, 1910 – A {{moderate}} hurricane to {{the east}} damages buildings in St. George's, topples a few banana trees, and <b>blows</b> <b>a</b> ship aground. Heavy rains provide residents with many months of clean drinking water.|$|E
5|$|A ridge soaring pilot uses upward air {{movements}} caused {{when the wind}} blows on {{to the sides of}} hills. It can also be augmented by thermals when the slopes also face the sun. In places where a steady wind <b>blows,</b> <b>a</b> ridge may allow virtually unlimited time aloft, although records for duration are no longer recognized because of the danger of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|Flower was {{intended}} as a spiritual successor to Flow. Using the PlayStation 3's motion sensitive controller, the player controls wind that <b>blows</b> <b>a</b> flower petal through the air. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 12, 2009.|$|E

25|$|Timber coffer dams were constructed; {{they were}} 76ft 6in by 29ft with two skins, {{the space between}} being filled with puddle clay. James Nasmyth had a novel design of steam pile driver; it had first been used in Devonport Docks in 1845; it could deliver 60 to 70 <b>blows</b> <b>a</b> minute; the cycle time with the hand {{operated}} pile drivers formerly in use was four minutes. The drop weight was 1½ tons and its stroke was 2ft 9in; one was purchased from Nasmyth.|$|E

50|$|Until 2008, the Braves {{were the}} last team in Major League Baseball to win a seventh game after <b>blowing</b> <b>a</b> 3-1 series lead. That year, the Tampa Bay Rays won Game 7 of the ALCS after <b>blowing</b> <b>a</b> 3-1 lead to the Boston Red Sox.|$|R

25|$|The {{new house}} {{features}} {{a set of}} automatically operated blinds that prevent it overheating {{when the sun is}} too hot for the plants together with a system that <b>blows</b> <b>a</b> continuous stream of cool air over the plants. The main design aim of the house is to allow maximum light transmission. To this end the glass is of a special low iron type that allows 90 per cent of the ultraviolet light in sunlight to pass. It is attached by high tension steel cables so that no light is obstructed by traditional glazing bars.|$|E
25|$|Further {{down in the}} Kobuk watershed, {{the river}} worked {{in concert with the}} wind to create one of the more famous landforms in Alaska: the Kobuk Dunes. These large sand dunes are the modern {{ancestor}} of alluvial deposits that became shaped and dominated by an exchange of aeolian and fluvial processes. In moister climates, the river has more water, and thus more power, and cuts down through a sandy bed. In times of drier climate, wind dominates and <b>blows</b> <b>a</b> lot of sediment into a weaker fluvial system, leading to aggradation and floodplain re-distribution.|$|E
25|$|The song {{structure}} {{consists of}} four pushups, singing the chorus and verse through four times. In each chorus the melody is introduced or led off by the lead singer whose is then seconded by another singer who begins to vary the melody {{before the end of}} the leader's first line. They are then joined by the entire chorus for the rest of the pushup. Three down strokes or hard beats mark the end of the chorus and beginning of the verse, and during these drummers will alter their dancing such as by hopping low like fancy dancers. An increase in tempo and volume on the last five beats marks the end of the final verse. The dancing stops on the final beat and then a tail, or coda, finishes the song with a shortened chorus. Sometimes a drum group will sing the song more than four times, particularly when the song feels good and the singers seize the moment for an extra pushup or two (or more), or when a dancer <b>blows</b> <b>a</b> whistle or passes his staff or fan over the drum to signal that the song is to be continued four extra pushups while he prays.|$|E

25|$|Games are officiated by one referee {{who usually}} has two assistants, {{one on each}} side of the field. The referee is {{responsible}} for ensuring the game is played according to the laws, keeping the time and recording the score. Prior to the start of the match, the referee organises the team captains for a coin toss. The winner chooses to either kick-off or selects an end of the playing field to defend in the first half. If the decision is made to kick off, the loser of the coin toss chooses an end to defend, otherwise they must kick off. After half time the teams swap ends and the team that did not kick off in the first half starts play. The referee <b>blows</b> <b>a</b> whistle to begin each half, stop play or indicate a score. The assistant referees raise a flag if the ball has crossed the touch line or scored a goal. They can also signal foul play by holding the flag out horizontally and in some games are able to communicate with the referee using microphones. In higher level matches a fourth official is appointed who can replace an assistant if needed and is usually responsible for allowing the substitutions to enter the playing field. A television match official is also sometimes appointed and the referee can consult them if they are unsure of a score.|$|E
25|$|The Exchange of Princesses {{celebrates the}} double {{marriage}} of the Anna of Austria to Louis XIII of France and Louis XIII's sister, Princess Elisabeth, to future king of Spain, Philip IV on 9 November 1615. France and Spain present the young princesses, {{aided by a}} youth who is probably Hymen. Above them, two putti brandish hymeneal torches, a small zephyr <b>blows</b> <b>a</b> warm breeze of spring and scatter roses, and a circle of joyous butterfly-winged putti surround Felicitas Publica with the caduceus, who showers the couple with gold from her cornucopia. Below, the river Andaye is filled with sea deities come {{to pay homage to}} the brides: the river-god Andaye rests on his urn, a nereid crowned with pearls offers a strand of pearls and coral as wedding gifts, while a triton blows the conch to herald the event. The wedding, which was thought to secure peace between France and Spain, took place on a float midway across the Bidassoa River, along the French-Spanish border. In Ruben's depiction, the princesses stand with their right hands joined between personifications of France and Spain. Spain with a recognizable symbol of a lion on her helmet is on the left, whereas France, with fleur-de-lis decorating her drapery, is on the right. Anna, at age fourteen the older of the two, turns back as if to take leave of Spain, while France gently pulls her by the left arm. In turn, Spain can be seen taking the thirteen-year-old Elisabeth by her left arm.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} few days several of the captives escaped. Hertel de Rouville {{instructed}} Reverend Williams to inform the others that recaptured escapees would be tortured; there were no further escapes. (The threat was not an empty one [...] it was known to have happened on other raids.) The French leader's troubles were not only with his captives. The Indians had some disagreements among themselves concerning the disposition of the captives, which at times threatened to come to <b>blows.</b> <b>A</b> council held on the third day resolved these disagreements sufficiently that the trek could continue.|$|E

500|$|Flower {{is divided}} up into six main levels and one credits level. Each level is {{represented}} by a flower in a pot on a city apartment windowsill, and upon selecting one the player is taken to the [...] "dream" [...] of that flower. Once inside a level, the player controls the wind as it <b>blows</b> <b>a</b> single flower petal through the air. Changes in the pitch and roll of the floating petal are accomplished by tilting the PlayStation 3 controller. Pressing any button blows the wind harder, which in turn moves the petal faster. The camera generally follows just behind the petal, though it sometimes moves to show a new objective or consequence of the player's actions.|$|E
500|$|Fuller had angered fellow {{poet and}} critic James Russell Lowell when she {{reviewed}} his work, calling him [...] "absolutely wanting {{in the true}} spirit and tone of poesy... his verse is stereotyped, his thought sounds no depth; and posterity will not remember him." [...] In response, Lowell took revenge in his satirical A Fable for Critics, first published in October 1848. At first, he considered excluding her entirely but ultimately gave her {{what was called the}} [...] "most wholly negative characterization" [...] in the work. Referring to her as Miranda, Lowell wrote that she stole old ideas and presented them as her own, she was genuine only in her spite and [...] "when acting as censor, she privately <b>blows</b> <b>a</b> censer of vanity 'neath her own nose".|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins at}} a press conference where Spears, wearing a cropped Mickey Mouse top (paying homage to her days in The New Mickey Mouse Club), is being asked {{inappropriate}} questions by news reporters, such as [...] "Is it true you banned junk food, smiles, candy, sunshine and laughter from your Femme Fatale tour?" [...] Angered by the questions, Spears replies (albeit censored): [...] "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, fuck you – I'm out", referencing a scene from the film Half Baked. After leaving the press conference, Spears walks out of the building and out into the street, wearing a white leather jacket and a black skirt with matching with studded combat boots. She signs a fan's copy of Femme Fatale and then <b>blows</b> <b>a</b> kiss to a baby as he whistles the melody of the chorus. As Spears walks along the street, she flashes several men, including a policeman (played by Adrien Galo). As a criminal offence, the policeman searches Spears, feeling up and down her legs, as she is bent over a car. Spears later walks away from the policeman, swinging handcuffs around her finger while he buttons his shirt.|$|E

The movie is a viscerally exciting, adrenaline-soaked tour de force of suspense and surprise, full of explosions and hectic scenes of combat, but it <b>blows</b> <b>a</b> hole in the condescending assumption that such effects are just empty spectacle or mindless noise."Scott noticed that the film reserved criticism of the war but wrote of how the director handled the film's limits, [...] "Ms. Bigelow, practicing a kind of hyperbolic realism, distills the psychological essence and moral complications of modern warfare {{into a series of}} brilliant, agonizing set pieces." [...] He also applauded the convergence of the characters in the film, saying that it [...] "focuses on three men whose contrasting temperaments knit this episodic exploration of peril and bravery into a coherent and satisfying story." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the performances of Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty would raise their profiles considerably, and said their characters reveal their [...] "unlooked-for aspects", such as Renner's character being playful with an Iraqi boy. Turan applauded Boal's [...] "lean and compelling" [...] script and said of Bigelow's direction, [...] "Bigelow and her team bring an awesome ferocity to re-creating the unhinged mania of bomb removal in an alien, culturally unfathomable atmosphere." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} a news anchor (played by Kristina Mitchell) saying {{the title of the}} song above a news banner that reads [...] "Britney Spears song lyrics spell out {{obscenity}} in disguise". This is a parody of an America's Newsroom report by Megyn Kelly. It then skips to a house, in which a sex party is coming to an end. Spears starts singing while {{sitting on the edge of}} a bed while the people that surround her are getting dressed. She gets up and looks out the window. As the first verse ends, she picks up a pair of panties from the floor, recalling her personal struggles and the [...] "Piece of Me" [...] video. She dances with four male dancers in the first chorus. During the second chorus, she dances with four other female dancers dressed in cheerleading outfits, while many men are watching them dance. The screen fades to white and Spears begins to change into a conservative '50s-inspired housewife outfit. As the chorus begins again, she comes out of her bedroom. She walks down the stairs, with dancers surrounding her and a woman gives her a potholder, which she uses to pick up a pie. After this, she walks out the front door of the house and is joined by her seemingly conservative-looking husband and children, one of them dressed with the schoolgirl outfit Spears wore in the [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] video. As they go down the walkway, they are surrounded by paparazzi, who have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. While the kids and husband wave, Spears smiles for the camera and <b>blows</b> <b>a</b> kiss. The video then ends with the news anchor saying, [...] "Doesn't make any sense, does it?".|$|E

The clip was official released {{few hours after}} she posted a 2000-word thank you message to fans on her official website on August 28, 2013. A part of the letter reads,I may get quiet at times, but when I do have something to say, I mean every word. I decided to share my thoughts with you at length and tell you openly how I feel. Thank you for filling my soul with melody and song … lyrics and love … and giving me a safe place I feel comforted in being brave enough to always bare my soul and come from an honest and genuine place.

It also featured guest appearances from Nicole Richie, Christina Milian, Chris Mann, Aguilera's son, Max Bratman, and her current boyfriend Matthew Rutler. The video begins with Aguilera' message, [...] "Hey everybody Chrisitina here just thanking you guys so much for filling my life and my heart with so much love continued throughout the years...
