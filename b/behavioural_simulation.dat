40|$|The {{approach}} {{described in}} this paper aims to offer designers {{a new way to}} investigate use processes of products by integrating scenarios of expected user behaviour with simulations of physical artefact behaviour. Use is considered a key process in the life cycle of a product, being the phase in which an instance of a product is put into service or applied for its purpose. Our approach aims at resolving three issues: (i) dealing with the diversity of use processes in behavioural simulations, (ii) the integration of simulation and modelling approaches and (iii) extending the deployability of behavioural simulations towards conceptual design. Currently, options for <b>behavioural</b> <b>simulation</b> of the use process of a product are limited. Performing complete-picture <b>behavioural</b> <b>simulation</b> in which the product and the human user react on each other’s behaviours is not practicable. To make this possible, a hybrid approach is proposed. Behaviour that is commonly modelled based on the laws of physics is simulated as continuous behaviour, while information-processing behaviour is simulated as discrete behaviour. This paper elaborates on modelling and simulation of discrete behaviour and linking it to continuous-behaviour simulation. Scenario structures are introduced to represent knowledge about different human decision-making patterns that influence the courses of a use process. Depending on what is available to the designer, these can be based on observations from real users or on conjecture. The objective is to make what-if studies possible to compare different scenarios of product use. This is demonstrated with a pilot study of a basic use process.

40|$|Abstract Background Biomedical {{research}} constantly produces new findings, {{but these}} are not routinely incorporated into health care practice. Currently, a range of interventions to promote the uptake of emerging evidence are available. While their effectiveness has been tested in pragmatic trials, these do not form a basis from which to generalise to routine care settings. Implementation research is the scientific study of methods to promote the uptake of research findings, and hence to reduce inappropriate care. As clinical practice is a form of human behaviour, theories of human behaviour that have proved to be useful in other settings offer a basis for developing a scientific rationale for the choice of interventions. Aims The aims of this protocol are 1) to develop interventions to change beliefs that have already been identified as antecedents to antibiotic prescribing for sore throats, and 2) to experimentally evaluate these interventions to identify those that have the largest impact on behavioural intention and <b>behavioural</b> <b>simulation.</b> Design The clinical focus for this work will be the management of uncomplicated sore throat in general practice. Symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections are common presenting features in primary care. They are frequently treated with antibiotics, and research evidence is clear that antibiotic treatment offers little or no benefit to otherwise healthy adult patients. Reducing antibiotic prescribing in the community by the "prudent" use of antibiotics is seen as one way to slow the rise in antibiotic resistance, and appears safe, at least in children. However, our understanding of how to do this is limited. Participants will be general medical practitioners. Two theory-based interventions will be designed to address the discriminant beliefs in the prescribing of antibiotics for sore throat, using empirically derived resources. The interventions will be evaluated in a 2 × 2 factorial randomised controlled trial delivered in a postal questionnaire survey. Two outcome measures will be assessed: behavioural intention and <b>behavioural</b> <b>simulation.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: This cluster {{randomised}} trial evaluated {{an intervention}} to decrease x-ray referrals and increase giving advice to stay active {{for people with}} acute low back pain (LBP) in general practice. METHODS: General practices were randomised to either access to a guideline for acute LBP (control) or facilitated interactive workshops (intervention). We measured behavioural predictors (e. g. knowledge, attitudes and intentions) and fear avoidance beliefs. We were unable to recruit sufficient patients to measure our original primary outcomes so we introduced other outcomes measured at the general practitioner (GP) level: <b>behavioural</b> <b>simulation</b> (clinical decision about vignettes) and rates of x-ray and CT-scan (medical administrative data). All those {{not involved in the}} delivery of the intervention were blinded to allocation. RESULTS: 47 practices (53 GPs) were randomised to the control and 45 practices (59 GPs) to the intervention. The number of GPs available for analysis at 12 months varied by outcome due to missing confounder information; a minimum of 38 GPs were available from the intervention group, and a minimum of 40 GPs from the control group. For the behavioural constructs, although effect estimates were small, the intervention group GPs had greater intention of practising consistent with the guideline for the clinical behaviour of x-ray referral. For <b>behavioural</b> <b>simulation,</b> intervention group GPs were more likely to adhere to guideline recommendations about x-ray (OR 1. 76, 95 %CI 1. 01, 3. 05) and more likely to give advice to stay active (OR 4. 49, 95 %CI 1. 90 to 10. 60). Imaging referral was not statistically significantly different between groups and the potential importance of effects was unclear; rate ratio 0. 87 (95 %CI 0. 68, 1. 10) for x-ray or CT-scan. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention led to small changes in GP intention to practice {{in a manner that is}} consistent with an evidence-based guideline, but it did not result in statistically significant changes in actual behaviour.

Synchronous Clos networks achieve higher throughput than asynchronous Clos networks because asynchronous Clos networks cannot hide the arbitration latency and their data paths are slow. The asynchronous Clos scheduler consumes significantly lower power than the synchronous scheduler and the asynchronous Clos network using bundled-data data switches shows the best power efficiency in all implementations.
