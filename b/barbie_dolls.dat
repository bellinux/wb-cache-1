In 2004, sales figures showed that Bratz dolls were outselling <b>Barbie</b> <b>dolls</b> in the United Kingdom, although Mattel maintained {{that in terms of}} the number of dolls, clothes, and accessories sold, Barbie remained the leading brand. In 2005, figures showed that sales of <b>Barbie</b> <b>dolls</b> had fallen by 30% in the United States, and by 18% worldwide, with much of the drop being attributed to the popularity of Bratz dolls.|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} 1990s Mattel had {{dominated}} the fashion doll market since the 1959 release of their Barbie doll. At the 1997 peak they held more than 90% of the market. MGA Entertainment released Bratz in 2001. With big heads and pouty lips they {{appealed to the}} 8- to 12-year-old tween market group. Bratz achieved great success and gradually took {{over some of the}} more wholesome Barbie doll's market share. Meanwhile, the market for Barbie grew younger. By 2003 the main market was 3- to 6-year-olds and Barbie's share of the fashion doll market had dropped to about 70%. In fall 2002 Mattel released My Scene, a line of redesigned <b>Barbie</b> <b>dolls,</b> in a bid to appeal to tweens and compete with Bratz. But they failed to reverse the company's faltering sales. Less than a year after the My Scene release, Flavas were launched in summer 2003 in a second attempt to appeal to the tween market and offer competition to Bratz. Production began only three months after Flavas were designed, and The New York Times described their launch as being rushed. The New York Times said that Flavas [...] "appeared to be heavily inspired" [...] by Bratz while Newsweek described Bratz as the [...] "anti-Barbie" [...] and Flavas as Mattel's [...] "anti-Barbie of its own." [...] Wall Street Journal commented that the Bratz success pushed Mattel to release Flavas in direct competition with its own <b>Barbie</b> <b>dolls.</b>|$|E

500|$|From the {{experience}} of growing up within two cultures Cisneros was able to combine both ethnicities, and in her stories she develops a major theme of hybridity between the American and Mexican cultures. [...] She draws upon her life experience as she [...] "depicts {{the situation of the}} Mexican-American woman: typically caught between two cultures, she resides in a cultural borderland. The topics of the stories range from the confusions of a bicultural and bilingual childhood to the struggles of a dark-skinned woman to recognize her own beauty in the land of <b>Barbie</b> <b>dolls</b> and blond beauty queens." [...] Because these issues are complex, Cisneros does not try to resolve all of them. Instead, she attempts to find neutral ground where the characters can try to meld their Mexican heritage with an American lifestyle, without feeling homesick for a country which, in some cases, the women have not even experienced.|$|E

Manufacturer Electronic Arts dismissed the allegations, with vice president Jeff Brown explaining that game characters have [...] "no anatomical detail" [...] under their clothes, effectively resembling <b>Barbie</b> <b>dolls.</b> Although the game does display blurred-out patches over body regions when characters are naked, such as when taking a shower, Brown said that was for [...] "humorous effect" [...] and denied there was anything improper about the game. Nevertheless, a command that could be entered into the in-game console in order to disable the blur effect was removed from the game in an expansion. No official reason was given for the change.|$|E

In preparation for her part, she undertook professional training to speak in the local Uttar Pradesh-dialect. The feature as well as her performance received critical acclaim. Anupama Chopra of NDTV stated, [...] "Vidya Balan's smoldering looks scorch the screen even as her eyes hint at tragedy.

In the back of my mind, I felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey before I even put out my album.’ Then, when it came out, I think it was the #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include <b>Barbie</b> <b>dolls</b> who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you in that. I feel like she liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But I told her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E
