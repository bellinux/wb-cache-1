5|$|California native Chris Carter {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to produce new shows for the Fox network in the early 1990s. Tired of the comedies he had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> Walt Disney Pictures, a report that 3.7 million Americans may have been abducted by aliens, the Watergate scandal and the 1970s horror series , triggered the idea for The X-Files. He wrote the pilot episode in 1992.|$|E
5|$|When Scott finally read Zelda's book, a {{week after}} she'd sent it to Perkins, he was furious. The book was a semi-autobiographical account of the Fitzgeralds' marriage. In letters, Scott berated her and fumed that the novel had drawn upon the autobiographical {{material}} {{that he planned to}} use in Tender Is the Night, which he'd <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> years, and which would finally see publication in 1934.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Rona {{was back}} in Paris {{studying}} with Joliot-Curie, who had discovered artificial radioactivity. Soon after, Curie died and Rona became ill, but {{she was able to}} return to Vienna late the following year to share what had been learned with a group of researchers made up of Pettersson, Elizabeth Kara-Michailova, and Ernst Føyn, who was serving as an assistant to Ellen Gleditsch at that time. Their studies centered on research of the effect caused by bombarding radionuclides with neutrons. In 1935 Rona consolidated some of these relationships, working on Stora Bornö, then visiting Gleditsch in Oslo, then traveling to Copenhagen to see Hevesy, and later to Kålhuvudet, Sweden to meet with Karlik and Pettersson. One of the projects the group had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> several years was to determine if there was any correlation between water depth and radium content, and their seawater research evaluated the concentration of elements in seawater collected from different locations.|$|E

25|$|Bruno Manser {{was nearly}} imprisoned twice in Sarawak, {{but managed to}} avoid being jailed. He was first arrested on 10 April 1986 after being spotted by police {{inspector}} Lores Matios. While on holiday at Long Napir, Limbang, Matios arrested Manser and brought him to Limbang police station. Manser was not handcuffed, as the inspector did not carry them while on holiday. During the 90-minute ride to Limbang, the Land Rover that carried Manser came close to running out of petrol. Manser {{jumped out of the}} Land Rover and dived into a local river as the vehicle was being refilled with petrol. Matios shouted at him and used his pistol to fire two shots at Manser. Manser lost all of the notebooks he had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> the previous four years. Bruno Manser was nearly arrested for a second time on 25 March 1990 after meeting the same police inspector on a flight from Miri, Malaysia to Kuching. The police inspector {{was on his way to}} take a law exam in Kuching. However, the inspector did not arrest Manser.|$|E

25|$|Naomi and Liam {{start their}} {{relationship}} fresh. Naomi admits to Liam {{that she has}} been feigning interest in things he likes and that she needs to be true to herself, even if it means their relationship won't work. This is what Liam wants, and their relationship becomes more stable; however, when Naomi is forced to come clean over false rumors she spread claiming that she was sexually harassed by a teacher, Mr. Cannon, Liam decides that he needs a break from her. During this time, Annie and Liam become closer and he consoles her after she overhears her mother, Debbie, confessing to her father, Harry, that she kissed her yoga instructor. His consolation causes Annie to believe that Liam is flirting with her, but realizing that this was not his intent, Annie instead advises Liam to stay with Naomi, as she does not want to ruin her friendship again over a boy. Liam begins to have his own troubles when his father returns, pretending that he wants to have a relationship with his son. But when Liam steals very valuable coins from his stepfather in hopes of starting a life with his father, he abandons Liam. Naomi becomes distracted by her pregnant sister Jen returning to town and causing trouble for Naomi. Naomi finds out that Ryan is the father of Jen's baby, and informs him of his impending fatherhood. Jen does not want Ryan {{to have anything to do}} with the future of their baby, but Ryan is insistent that he should be involved. After Liam breaks up with her, a devastated Naomi is raped by Mr. Cannon, who tells her that after her initial false accusations, nobody will believe her. Mr. Cannon and Naomi had been working on a digital media project when they had become close and worked after hours on a project. This is also when Naomi was attacked by Mr. Cannon. Dixon leaves for Australia with Ivy after witnessing his parents having another argument. Harry informs Debbie that he was fired as principal of West Beverly after covering up an incident at school for Dixon. Annie reveals to Liam about the hit-and-run, and he encourages her to confess. Jasper is jealous that Annie and Liam are spending so much time together and sets fire to Liam's boat that he has <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a very long time. Liam sees this and attacks Jasper as the police arrive.|$|E
500|$|Pinkner and Wyman {{revealed}} {{in a conference}} call interview that the episode was the [...] "culmination of {{a lot of things that}} [...] had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> quite a while". Though they loved all of their episodes, the two stated that [...] "Entrada" [...] was a particular favorite of theirs, with Pinker elaborating that [...] "if the only episode of Fringe you ever tune into watch is this one, sure, it’s going to take you five minutes to catch up, but you will feel what’s going on, and you will understand the relationships... a great entry point". The producers considered making [...] "Entrada" [...] the mid-season finale, but instead selected [...] "Marionette", the following week's episode.|$|E
500|$|Showrunners J. H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner {{wrote the}} episode as the [...] "culmination {{of a lot}} of things that [...] had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> quite a while." [...] Calling it one of their {{favorite}} episodes, they believed it was a good entry point for new viewers to the series. Frequent Fringe collaborator Brad Anderson returned to direct the episode. [...] "Entrada" [...] first aired on December 2, 2010 in the United States to an estimated 5.13 million viewers. It has been selected for [...] "best episode" [...] lists by various television critics. Both Anna Torv and John Noble submitted the episode for consideration at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, but both failed to garner a nomination.|$|E

Tired of the comedies he had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> Walt Disney Pictures, inspired by a report that 3.7 million Americans may have been abducted by aliens, and recalling memories of Watergate and the 1970s horror series , Carter {{came up with the idea}} for The X-Files and wrote the pilot episode himself in 1992. He initially struggled over the untested concept—executives wanted a love interest for Scully—and casting. The network wanted either a more established or a [...] "taller, leggier, blonder and breastier" [...] actress for Scully than the 24-year-old Gillian Anderson, a theater veteran with minor film experience, who Carter felt was the only choice after auditions.|$|E
500|$|The year 2005 saw {{the release}} of a project Thompson had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> nine years. Loosely based on the Nurse Matilda stories that she read as a child, Thompson wrote the {{screenplay}} for the children's film Nanny McPhee– which centres on a mysterious, unsightly nanny who must discipline a group of children. She also took the lead role, alongside Colin Firth and Angela Lansbury, in what was a highly personal project. The film was a success, taking number one at the UK box office and earning $122 million worldwide. Commenting on Thompson's screenplay, film critic Claudia Puig wrote that its [...] "well-worn storybook features are woven effectively into an appealing tale of youthful empowerment". The following year, Thompson appeared in the surreal American comedy–drama Stranger than Fiction, playing a novelist whose latest character (played by Will Ferrell) is a real person who hears her narration in his head. Reviews for the film were generally favourable.|$|E
500|$|In an interview, King {{described}} [...] "Chasing Death" [...] {{as being}} about alcoholism: [...] "it's {{like people who}} drink too much. They don't help themselves out so they're chasing death." [...] He explained [...] "Implode" [...] as being {{about the end of}} the world. The album could feature material written by Hanneman prior to his passing. Araya has explained that Hanneman had two songs that he submitted to the rest of the band. One song was an outtake from World Painted Blood, which Araya said that he and Hanneman had been working on melody and lyrics for. Additionally, Araya has said that he plans to go through Hanneman's personal audio files, and that some of that material could also find its way onto the new album in one form or another. One song, mentioned by King in an interview, is [...] "Piano Wire," [...] an unfinished track that Hanneman had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> the previous album. King also mentioned that there were two other songs that Hanneman had been holding onto for the last 15 to 20 years that will be released.|$|E

500|$|Gaga did not spare any {{free time}} for the song's {{recording}} and would usually start the sessions after the Born This Way Ball show performances were over. Madeon noted: [...] "She would still give everything – even on the demo take! She's really impressive." [...] Madeon's production on Artpop differs from his usual work. According Dylan Farella of Dancing Astronaut, the song [...] "take the mood of Artpop from ballad to anthem". On French radio Hit West, Madeon recalled that in September 2012 {{he had gone to}} see Gaga at her Born This Way Ball show at Paris' Stade de France. After the performance, Gaga took Madeon to her hotel room. He played her some chords he had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> sometime. Gaga immediately started singing the main melody of [...] "Gypsy", and then the main song [...] "flowed out", leading them to write a demo the same night. Since Madeon had brought his computer with him, he recorded the ideas developed with Gaga so he would not forget them. Afterwards, the song went through various changes, and more musicians were added for the final version on the album.|$|E
500|$|The group's first album, Capitol T996 The Kingston Trio, was {{recorded}} over a three-day period in February 1958 and released in June that year, {{just as the}} Trio was beginning its engagement at the Hungry i. Gilmore had made two important supervisory decisions as producer — first, to add {{the same kind of}} [...] "bottom" [...] to the Trio's sound that he had heard in live performance and consequently recruiting Purple Onion house bassist Buzz Wheeler to play on the album, and second to record the group's songs without the secondary orchestral accompaniment that was nearly universal (even for folk-styled records) at the time. The song selections on the first album reflected the repertoire that the musicians had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> two years—re-imagined traditional songs inspired by The Weavers like [...] "Santy Anno" [...] and [...] "Bay of Mexico," [...] calypso-flavored tunes reminiscent of the hugely popular Harry Belafonte recordings of the time such as [...] "Banua" [...] and [...] "Sloop John B", and a mix of both foreign language and contemporary songwriter numbers, including Terry Gilkyson's [...] "Fast Freight" [...] and [...] "Scotch and Soda", whose authorship remains unknown as of 2015.|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, Smith's Bill C-268 {{successfully}} {{passed into}} law as An Act {{to amend the}} Criminal Code (minimum sentence for offences involving trafficking of persons {{under the age of}} eighteen years). The following September, she released [...] "Connecting the Dots", a national action plan proposal she had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> three years. [...] "Connecting the Dots" [...] sought [...] "to rescue and restore the victims and prosecute the offenders" [...] of human trafficking; Smith intended it to address both trafficking within Canada and international trafficking into the country. Smith announced several dozen specific recommendations for the proposed plan, one of which was to create an office to regularly evaluate national human trafficking opposition efforts and generate annual reports of their findings. Other recommendations were to increase funding for organizations that support human trafficking victims; to establish safe houses for victims in every Canadian province; to increase the use of Canada's human trafficking laws by educating police, judges, and lawyers about these relatively new laws; to initiate an extensive public relations campaign on the subject; and to have the federal government coordinate its activities with provincial governments, Aboriginal leaders, NGOs, law enforcement agencies, and human trafficking survivors.|$|E

500|$|Wentz formed {{electronic}} duo Black Cards with vocalist Bebe Rexha in July 2010. The project released {{one single}} before album delays led to Rexha's departure in 2011. Black Cards added Spencer Peterson {{to complete the}} Use Your Disillusion EP in 2012. Wentz also completed writing a novel, Gray, that he had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> six years outside the band, and began hosting the reality tattoo competition show Best Ink. Hurley ventured farther into rock during the hiatus, drumming with multiple bands over the three-year period. He continued to manage his record label, Fuck City, and drummed for bands Burning Empires and Enabler. He also formed heavy metal outfit The Damned Things with Trohman, Scott Ian and Rob Caggiano of Anthrax, and Keith Buckley of Every Time I Die. Despite this, the members all remained cordial to one another; Wentz was Stump's best man at his wedding. The hiatus was, all things considered, beneficial for the group and its members, according to Hurley. [...] "The hiatus helped them all kind of figure themselves out," [...] he explained in 2013. [...] "Especially Joe and Patrick, who were so young. And Pete is a million times better." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title was}} {{inspired}} by one of Shakira's trips to the capital of her native country Colombia. At the El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, after finishing her Tour Pies Descalzos, part of her luggage was stolen, including a briefcase that contained all the lyrics Shakira had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> the album. Shakira commented, [...] "The worst part {{about the whole thing}} was that I couldn't remember them because of the mental block that can be caused by such a traumatic experience as the robbery of such a personal item". Feelings of impotence and emptiness overcame Shakira with such violence that {{for a couple of days}} and nights she thought of nothing but the people who had taken her material. She could not stop thinking about them: [...] "Who are they? What are they looking for? Where are they?". She searched for a reason behind the theft of her songs. [...] "I came to the conclusion that there are all types of thieves. A thief is not just a person who takes a physical object that doesn't belong to him or her. There are thieves who steal feelings, space, time, dreams, rights", she explained.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{had already}} started work on the album with Williams, and during one of her breaks from recording, her manager Guy Oseary spoke to Timberlake, {{suggesting}} that it [...] "would be cool" [...] if he recorded some songs with her. Timberlake commented [...] "'That would be awesome,' but I thought, 'That'll never happen', [...] But it's a testament to Pharrell. He had already laid the groundwork {{where she was going}} with it. She played 'Candy Shop' for me, {{and a couple of other}} songs, and I thought, 'What a cool direction.' I thought she could essentially do the whole record with Pharrell if she wanted to, and I asked Tim, 'How do we fit in?' And it basically came down to how we did my record, co-producing, and just throwing Madonna in the mix." [...] The first track recorded by Madonna and Timberlake was [...] "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You". Timberlake felt that the song, which Madonna had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> years before the Hard Candy project, was comparable to [...] "Frozen" [...] (1998). He wanted to turn the line [...] "'The devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do" [...] into a catchy hook and make it sound like a concept.|$|E
