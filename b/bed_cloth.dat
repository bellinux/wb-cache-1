60|$|The palaces were, however, at last made ready before Margaret came. There were apartments {{for her in}} the Tower, {{and there}} were also three other palaces in and near London, in either of which she could reside at her pleasure. Besides this, the cardinal, who, as has already been remarked, was possessed of immense wealth, owned, among his other establishments, a {{beautiful}} mansion at Waltham Forest, a few miles north of London. The cardinal set apart a state chamber in this house for the exclusive use of the queen when she came to visit him, and caused it to be fitted up and furnished in a magnificent manner for her. The drapery of the <b>bed</b> was of <b>cloth</b> of gold from Damascus, and the other furniture and fittings were to correspond. The queen used often to go and visit the cardinal at this country seat. She soon became very fond of him, and willing to be guided by his counsel in almost every thing that she did. Indeed, the ascendency which the cardinal thus exercised over Margaret greatly increased his power over the king. The affairs of the court and of the government were directed almost wholly by his counsels. The Duke of Gloucester and the nobles of his party became more and more indignant and angry at this state of things. The realm of England, they said, through the weakness and imbecility of the king, had fallen into the hands of a priest and of a woman--a French woman, too.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is, in {{collaboration}} with the Swedish company Innventia, to explore the possibilities of using paper machines to create fabric-like nonwoven materials. As part of a relatively new research-area, it serves as some of the ground knowledge that is needed to drive this field forward. The research of this thesis is born from the increasing need for more environmental friendly textiles, and to find new uses for the paper production facilities and companies that are currently experiencing a decline in paper production. The materials used in the research were produced with the Finnish handsheet former and the StratEx sheet-maker made by Innventia. The research consists of the following tests: Tissue Softness Analysis, (TSA), tensile strength and bending stiffness. The tests are done with different combinations of lyocell, PLA, softwood and dissolving pulp in the tested sheets. It is also tested if the lyocell can be a meaningful substitution for PLA in combination with softwood pulp and dissolving pulp when creating the fabric-like materials. In conclusion of this research it can be said that, compared to benchmarking samples like <b>bedding</b> sheets, table <b>cloths</b> and cotton shirts, the sheets created and tested are competitive alternatives to existing materials when it comes to softness. It also became clear that the tensile strength has to be increased to make fabric-like nonwoven materials applicable on the same level as existing textiles. Even so, it is still evident that there is a potentiality in the use of paper machines in the development and creation of new fabric-like materials...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Fundamental in {{traditional}} postpartum recovery in Lao PDR {{is the use}} of hotbeds, mother roasting, steam sauna and steam baths. During these treatments medicinal plants play a crucial role, but little has been published about how the treatments are carried out precisely, which species are used, the medicinal properties of these species, and the medicinal efficacy of their chemical constituents. Methods Sixty-five interviews, in 15 rural villages, with women of 4 different ethnic groups were conducted to survey confinement rituals, and postpartum plant use and salience. Essential oils from the main species used were extracted using steam distillation and the main chemical constituents characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results A total of 10 different species were used by three or more of the ethnic groups included in this study. All species were used in steam sauna and bath, but only 3 species were used in hotbed and mother roasting. Essential oils of Amomum villosum, Amomum microcarpum and Blumea balsamifera were found to contain significant amounts of the following terpenes: β-pinene, camphor, bornyl acetate, borneol, linalool, D-limonene, fenchone, terpinen- 4 -ol and α-terpinene. Conclusions Many of these terpenes have documented antimicrobial and analgesic properties, and some have also synergistic interactions with other terpenes. The mode of application in hotbed and mother roasting differs from the documented mechanisms of action of these terpenes. Plants in these two practices are likely to serve mainly hygienic purposes, by segregating the mother from infection sources such as <b>beds,</b> mats, stools, <b>cloth</b> and towels. Steam sauna medicinal plant use through inhalation of essential oils vapors can possibly have medicinal efficacy, but is unlikely to alleviate the ailments commonly encountered during postpartum convalescence. Steam sauna medicinal plant use through dermal condensation of essential oils, and steam bath cleansing of the perineal area is possibly a pragmatic use of the reported medicinal plants, as terpene constituents have documented antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The {{town center}} {{is called the}} Plaza Vasco de Quiroga or the Plaza Grande. This plaza is large {{considering}} {{the size of the}} town. The Plaza Grande was dedicated to Vasco de Quiroga in 1964, when a fountain containing a bronze statue of the bishop was placed in the center. This sculpture was done by Costa Rican artist Francisco Zúñiga. The Plaza is surrounded by old, stately ash trees and colonial-era mansions. Unlike most other towns and cities in Mexico, the main church does not face this plaza. [...] While crafts can be seen for sale in all of the town, they are prominent in the Plaza. The main square is filled with stores selling a very wide variety of crafts including carved wooden statues and furniture, brightly painted accents depicting flowers and animals, brilliant piles of woven textiles, draperies, table <b>cloths,</b> <b>bed</b> spreads and napkins, wooden figures, religious art, clay plaques and pots, polished wooden boxes and guitars, picture frames, woolen blankets, copper vases and platters, basketry and items made of woven straw and reed, and sculpted and scented candles. Many of these are on display in the shops set into the colonial buildings around the plaza, with much more inside. Facing the main plaza is the Palace of Huitziméngari. This structure, like {{most of the rest of}} the town, is made of adobe and has a clay tile roof. This palace belonged to Antonio de Huitziméngari, the son of the last Tarascan cazonci (monarch), and the godson of the first viceroy of New Spain, Antonio de Mendoza. It has two floors, a sober facade and the inner courtyard is surrounded with round arches and filled with flowers. On the upper floor, there is a statue of a dog, an allusion to Huitziméngari's name which in Tarascan mythology referred to the dog that served the Lord of Paradise. The dog motif is repeated on some of the inside doors.|$|R
30|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to produce water from atmospheric air by using different desiccant materials. Kobayashi (1963) extracted water vapors from air by using adsorbent technology using modular cassettes. It was a patent technology. Abualhamayel and Gandhidasan (1997) produced 1.92  kg/m 2 of water by using CaCl 2 as an absorbent in blackened, titled surface and single glazing box. Gordeeva et al. (1998) used new composite desiccant materials called selective water sorbent in this field. They performed their experiments in Boreskov Institute of catalysis, Novosibirsk, Russia, and the water collected from the system was 3 – 5 tones per day from 10 ton of dry sorbents. Gad et al. (2001) used thick corrugated cloth of different layers and dipped into 30 – 40 % concentration of CaCl 2, which produced water 1.5  l/m 2 in a day. Kabeel (2004) extracted 1.2  l water per square meter of glass cover by using 30 % concentrated calcium chloride impregnated with sandy bed in Egypt. Furthermore, Kabeel (2007) made two glass pyramids of the same dimensions with a multi-shelf. In the first pyramid, the saw wood was kept in a bed, whereas in the second pyramid, the bed was made of <b>cloth.</b> Both <b>bed</b> saturated with 30 % concentrated CaCl 2. After the investigation, it was found that the <b>cloth</b> <b>bed</b> absorbs more moisture as compared to saw wood and 2.5  l/(day m 2) water was produced by the system. Zheng et al. (2011) performed experiments on the ship by making two adsorption towers of the same size and capacity. In the first tower there was silica gel, while in the second tower have used composite material which consists of silica gel and CaCl 2 in the ratio of 7 : 3, respectively. The water produced from the first tower was 0.5  kg from 9  kg of silica gel, while the productivity enhanced by 3 : 4 times that of silica gel by using composite material. William et al. (2015) collected water by using trapezoidal prism. The sides of prism were made of fiber glass. Two types of composite desiccant materials, i.e., cloth/CaCl 2 and sand/CaCl 2, were used for water production from atmospheric air using solar energy and water collected during the experiments were 2.32 and 1.23  silt/days m 2, respectively. Kumar and Yadav (2015) performed experiments on solar glass desiccant box system using saw wood impregnated with different concentrations of CaCl 2. The maximum production was 180  ml/kg/day for concentration 60 % of CaCl 2. The optimum design parameter for the maximum yield was 0.22  m air gap height, 30 ° inclination angle and 3  mm glass thickness. In the same setup, Kumar and Yadav (2016) produced water from the composite desiccant material of CaCl 2 /floral foam and the yield was 0.35  ml/cm 3 /day. The cost analysis of solar glass desiccant box system was also carried out by the author. Wang et al. (2017 a) performed experiments on eight sorbent composites with four matrixes of ACF, E, ES and SC and two salts of CaCl 2 and LiCl of each having 30 % concentration. After the investigation, it was concluded that ACF with LiCl has the best water uptake capability and also has the best desorption capacity (0.6  g/g) at 77  °C and 20 % RH. Kabeel et al. (2016) used thermoelectric technology (TE) in this field so that evaporation rate can be increased and hence increases the efficiency of the system. The productivity of the system was 3.9  l/h/m 2. Mohamed (2017) developed the mathematical model for regeneration process for theoretical study and found 15 % improvement compared to other published models in theoretical study. In addition, the author also studied the initial desiccant concentration, solution mass, bed materials of wet desiccant system. The productivity of the system was 3  l/day m 2 fresh water for 30 % solution concentration. Wang et al. (2017 b) used active carbon felt with LiCl for the water production from semi-opened system. Sorption and desorption have been carried out at different weather conditions, and the maximum 14.7  kg of water was collected by using 40.8  kg. Kim et al. (2017) used metal organic framework microcrystalline powder MOF- 801 [Zr 6 O 4 (OH) 4 (fumarate) 6] for water production from atmospheric air under weather condition of South Arabia. When the humidity was less than 20 %, the productivity of the system was 2.8  l/kg of MOF. Tu et al. (2018) reviewed the different methods of water production from atmospheric air including radiative cooling, adsorption-based water production and solar distilling. The economic hindrance and their solution also have been discussed in this article. Talaat et al. (2018) used cloth layer impregnated with CaCl 2 solution to extract water vapors from atmospheric air by solar-powered portable apparatus. Double faced conical type absorber had been used to absorb the moisture during the night and during the day time this absorber had been covered tightly with conical transparent surface. The output of the system varied from 0.3295 to 0.6310  kg/m 2 /day.|$|R
