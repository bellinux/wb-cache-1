5|$|The crémant {{produced}} in the Languedoc is made according to the Méthode Traditionnelle - formerly known as méthode champenoise, the same method used to produce the Champagne, including a second fermentation in the <b>bottle</b> <b>to</b> encapture the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast - in the small villages around the town of Limoux. The wines are normally composed of 70% Mauzac and a 30% combination of Chardonnay and Chenin blanc. AOC regulations require a year of aging on the lees. The Blanquette de Limoux, when labelled méthode ancestrale, is composed entirely of Mauzac, undergoes only one fermentation and is aged approximately three months less on the lees before the bottling, the actual date being determined by the moon's cycle.|$|E
5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is grown}} {{in nearly every}} South American country {{including}} Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. In Chile, the wines were historically limited by the excessively high yields that were commonplace throughout the country. As producers begun to concentrate on limiting yields, regional differences began to emerge that distinguished Chilean Cabernets. For vineyard plantings along flat river valleys, the climate of the region {{is the most important}} consideration; as plantings move to higher elevations and along hillsides, soil type is a greater concern. The wines of the Aconcagua region are noted for their ripe fruit but closed, tight structure that needs some time in the <b>bottle</b> <b>to</b> develop. In the Maipo Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are characterized by their pervasive blackcurrant fruit and an earthy, dusty note. In warmer regions, such as the Colchagua Province and around Curicó, the grapes ripen more fully; they produce wines with rich fruit flavors that can be perceived as sweet due to the ripeness of the fruit. The acidity levels of these wines will be lower and the tannins will also be softer, making the wines more approachable at a younger age.|$|E

25|$|Bottle caps, or closures, {{are used}} to seal the {{openings}} of bottles of many types. They can be small circular pieces of metal, usually steel, with plastic backings, and for plastic bottles a plastic cap is used instead. Caps can also be plastic, sometimes with a pour spout. Flip-Top caps like Flapper closures provide controlled dispensing of dry products. The crown cork, the first form of a bottle cap, possessed flanges bent over a sealed <b>bottle</b> <b>to</b> compress the liquid inside. It was invented and patented in 1892 by William Painter of Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E

25|$|People {{believed}} {{that women who}} were not faithful to their husbands would experience prolonged labor, and male traditional healers would remark that a promiscuous woman {{would have to tell}} every person in the room the number of men she has slept with apart from her husband before {{she would be able to}} give birth. Other traditional beliefs and practices related to laboring women included special herbs being used when the umbilical cord was wrapped around the neck of the fetus and for breech presentations, hot water poured on the abdomen and okra smeared on the vagina to expedite delivery, women who could not birth the placenta were given a <b>bottle</b> <b>to</b> blow into in order to force the placenta out, and a calabash of hot water was placed on the abdomen to stop postpartum hemorrhage and bleeding. Although many people have extensive knowledge of these traditional beliefs and practices, many indicate that most people no longer use them.|$|E

When Emma and Elsa arrive and unseal the Vault, Regina uses her pyrokinetic powers against them and they shield themselves with the ribbons on their wrists; the ribbons free Emma and Elsa, and Emma uses her powers to stall Regina from going after them. Regina, believing that Emma went to the Sheriff's station, shows up there, only to set up a battle between her and Mary Margaret. Regina then makes Anna and Kristoff disappear, and they end up on the beachfront. As Kristoff argues with Anna, she trips her leg on a bottle.

25|$|Throughout his research, Bateman {{conducted}} experiments using {{fruit flies}} {{in order to}} observe their copulation and sexual behavior. A total of six series of experiments were conducted with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, using three to five individuals of each sex. Each trial ran {{for three or four}} days. Some ran to completion without the transfer of the Drosophila from one environment (<b>bottle)</b> <b>to</b> another. In the others, Bateman transferred the flies and their eggs to a new bottle every day. Bateman also varied the age of the flies depending on the experiment, with an age gap between one and six days total. He never watched the flies' copulations. The flies used were from several inbred strains, which meant they could be identified by their specific inbred strain. Therefore, he inferred the number of involved mates {{based on the number of}} offspring that were later found to have mutations from both a male and a female. The difficulty that arose was that if a female Drosophila had copulated with five males and only one larva survived, Bateman would not be able to account for the other four copulations.|$|E
25|$|Then {{everything}} changed when the Jin dynasty attacked, with even better bombs. The iron bomb. Traditionally {{the inspiration for}} the development of the iron bomb is ascribed to the tale of a fox hunter named Iron Li. According to the story, around the year 1189 Iron Li developed a new method for hunting foxes which used a ceramic explosive to scare foxes into his nets. The explosive consisted of a ceramic bottle with a mouth, stuffed with gunpowder, and attached with a fuse. Explosive and net were placed at strategic points of places such as watering holes frequented by foxes, and when they got near enough, Iron Li would light the fuse, causing the ceramic <b>bottle</b> <b>to</b> explode and scaring the frightened foxes right into his nets. While a fanciful tale, it's not exactly certain why this would cause the development of the iron bomb, given the explosive was made using ceramics, and other materials such as bamboo or even leather would have done the same job, assuming they made a loud enough noise. Nonetheless, the iron bomb made its first appearance in 1221 at the siege of Qizhou (in modern Hubei province), and this time it would be the Jin who possessed the technological advantage. The Song command Zhao Yurong (趙與褣) survived and was able to relay his account for posterity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the main}} event of the evening, Dr. Wagner Jr., {{accompanied}} by his brother Silver King and son El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr., faced Máscara Año 2000 Jr., accompanied by his father Máscara Año 2000, in a Mask vs. Mask match. Máscara Año 2000 interfered in the match on several occasions, and when, {{towards the end of}} the match, he interfered once again, Silver King grabbed a steel chair and looked to attack him, but instead turned on his brother. As the fans in attendance started to fill the ring with trash, El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr. entered and attacked his uncle and Máscara Año 2000, but was then taken out by Máscara Año 2000 Jr. The El Consejo member was now in full control of the match, but when he was unable to finish Wagner Jr., Silver King and Máscara Año 2000 once again returned to the ring. However, so did El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr., who dove onto the two men with a flying kick, taking them out of the equation. He then gave a glass <b>bottle</b> <b>to</b> his father, who broke it over Máscara Año 2000 Jr.'s head and then dropped him with his finishing maneuver, the Wagner Driver, for the win. Following the match, Máscara Año 2000 Jr. was unmasked by his daughter, while he revealed that he was Ángel Reyes, originally from Lagos de Moreno, Jalisco. The twentieth Triplemanía ended with Wagner Jr. celebrating in the ring.|$|E

25|$|At AAA's {{previous}} major event, Rey de Reyes on March 18, 2012, rudo stable El Consejo {{picked up}} their first win in AAA, when Máscara Año 2000 Jr., El Texano Jr. and Toscano defeated Dr. Wagner Jr., Electroshock and Heavy Metal in a six-man tag team match, with Máscara Año 2000 Jr. pinning Wagner Jr. for the win, following interference from El Consejos masked accomplice El Hombre de Negro ("The Man in black"). In {{the weeks that}} followed Rey de Reyes, Máscara Año 2000 Jr. kept making challenges towards Wagner Jr. for a singles match, while El Consejo as a whole also feuded with Chessman, Silver King and Último Gladiador of rudo stable La Sociedad. This would, on April 30, drive longtime rivals and real-life brothers, Wagner Jr. and Silver King to make peace with each other and team up against Máscara Año 2000 Jr. and El Texano Jr. After losing as a result of another interference from El Hombre de Negro, the brothers shook hands to signal the end of hostilities between the two. On June 1, Máscara Año 2000 Jr. pinned Wagner Jr. in a rematch from April 30 and afterwards challenged him to a Mask vs. Mask Lucha de Apuestas, which Wagner Jr. accepted and named Triplemanía XX as the place, where he wanted the match to take place. A third match between Máscara Año 2000 Jr. and El Texano and the Wagner brothers took place on June 16 and ended with El Consejo picking another win with help from El Hombre de Negro, who during a post-match beatdown unmasked and revealed himself as Máscara Año 2000, the legitimate father of Máscara Año 2000 Jr., who on April 30, 1993, had lost his mask to Perro Aguayo in the semi-main event of the first Triplemanía. In an interview on AAA's NotiAAA program, Máscara Año 2000 Jr. accepted the Mask vs. Mask match for Triplemanía XX and vowed to prove his family's superiority over the Wagner family by placing Wagner Jr.'s mask in his family's display cabinet. On June 30, Máscara Año 2000 Jr. defeated Wagner Jr. in a singles match with help from his father, after which the Mask vs. Mask match was made official for Triplemanía XX. On July 27 at the final AAA television taping before Triplemanía XX, the promotion recreated a famous segment from 1993, when Máscara Año 2000 hit Perro Aguayo with a glass bottle prior to their Triplemanía match, by having Máscara Año 2000 Jr. hit Dr. Wagner Jr. with a glass <b>bottle</b> <b>to</b> a win a No Disqualification match between the two, leaving his adversary bloodied in the ring heading into their Mask vs. Mask match.|$|E
