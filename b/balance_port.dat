These marine species are primarily introduced in North-European waters through ballast water, i. e. water trans-ported across the oceans so as to keep a vessel in <b>balance.</b> <b>Port</b> authorities can impose standards on ballast water treatment, which are associated with costs. This, in turn, leads to the question which benefits {{are associated with the}} commitment of such standards. Monetary valu-ation can provide information on this. This article reports a monetary valuation study of a marine protection pro-gram. The program focuses on the prevention of harmful algal bIoom species along the coastline of the Nether-lands. It entails the construction of a ballast water dis-posal treatment in the Rotterdam harbor, and the imple-mentation of a monitoring program of the water quality in the open sea along the North-Holland beaches. The valuation survey is based on a questionnaire undertaken at Zandvoort, a famous Dutch beach resort. Since the economic value of the marine protection program included non-market benefits associated with beach recreation, human health and marine ecosystem impacts, both contingent valuation and travel cost methods are used.

40|$|Microwave {{systems have}} {{enormous}} impact on modern society. Applications are diverse, from entertainment via satellite television, to civil and military radar systems. New microwave applications are also presenting new design challenges to microwave circuit designers. For example, the recent trend of multi-frequency bands and multi-function operations in wireless communication systems {{along with the}} explosion in wireless portable devices are imposing more stringent requirements upon the size and capability of multi-band operation for microwave circuits. In this dissertation, we intend to address the design issues related to microwave balun [...] an important microwave circuit block that converts unbalanced signals to balanced ones. Several novel design approaches for meeting the above-described challenges in microwave baluns are presented based on in-depth theoretical analysis and practical implementation. To achieve multi-band operation, two dual-band quarter-wavelength coupled transmission lines are proposed. One employed tapped stubs forming T-shaped three-section coupled lines, while another employed step impedance resonator (SIR) which also features three-section structures. The first one exhibits compact size, while the second one is good for uni-planar implementation without additional bond wires. Based on these two equivalent coupled-line units, two dual-band baluns are proposed. The analytical design equations are derived and are in excellent agreement with the numerical field solutions. In additional to the equivalent quarter-wavelength units, a novel approach with additional stubs tapped to the <b>balanced</b> <b>ports</b> of a balun is shown {{to be capable of}} providing dual-band performance. The two stubs induce a transmission zero within a wide band and divide it into two separate operating bands. Furthermore, it is shown that the position and physical parameters of the tapped stubs can be used to tune the relations of the two bands, providing robust design flexibilities. The design parameters are derived with close form formulas. Two dual-band baluns with different topologies working for GSM and IEEE 802. 11 family are designed, simulated and fabricated. The design concept of these baluns is validated by measurement results...|$|R
40|$|In this letter, a novel {{dual-mode}} bandpass balun filter {{is presented}} using a miniaturized cross-slotted patch resonator. This balun filter {{consists of a}} single slit-loaded patch etched {{by a pair of}} cross slots and a stepped-impedance open stub. An unbalanced input port is orthogonally arranged in-between two <b>balanced</b> output <b>ports</b> along the patch, and each feed line is connected to an additional stub for enhanced coupling. Due to the dual-mode characteristic of the patch resonator, two transmission poles can be easily constructed at both balanced passbands. Asymmetrical width and length of the cross-loaded slots perturb the field of the patch and excite two degenerate modes simultaneously, while the attached open-circuited stub provides an additional degree of freedom for performance tuning. Finally, two prototype balun filters are designed and fabricated at 3. 48 and 1. 80 GHz, respectively.

40|$|Indonesian new {{government}} (under new President from 2014 election) issues âMaritime-highwayâ policy by developing 24 strategic ports to form mainline of national maritime transportation network (Indonesian Ministry of Development Planning, 2015). This policy aims to reduce transportation cost {{as well as}} economy (price) disparities between west and east region in Indonesia. However, as a new policy from the {{new government}}, it still needs more supporting studies to optimize maritime network between selected strategic ports for freight transportation. In addition, as a national level policy, it also needs to consider macro economy future perspective since it will be implemented {{in a long term}} period. Therefore, a comprehensive study is conducted to develop a design of Indonesiaâs freight maritime network using a multi-objectives optimization model with main objectives to minimize total cost and total distance simultaneously. Literatures review and analysis of Indonesiaâs freight maritime network current situation are required to identify important factors for the model implementation. An Origin-Destination (OD) demand matrix for year 2030 is generated as the main input for simulation model analysis. There are three scenarios in the model simulation. First scenario uses OD matrix based on growth factor for each province that is calculated from Growth Domestic Regional Product (GDRP) realization (until 2013) and GDRP target from Indonesian government (until 2019 and continue the 2019 target to the year 2030). In the second scenario, a more balance demand especially in east region is applied by increasing growth factor for provinces with very low GDRP value. Finally, third scenario uses more equal handling cost among ports in the network with the same OD matrix from the second scenario. Furthermore, analysis and selection of alternatives in maritime network design are performed {{based on the results of}} the model simulation for each scenario. The final result of this study shows that the recommended maritime network designs have noticeable differences compare to initial network in maritime highway policy especially in the second and the third scenario. In these scenarios, the number and composition of hub and feeder ports are significantly changed due to more balance demand between provinces and more <b>balance</b> <b>ports</b> handling cost in the third scenario. There are also some additional routes, hub ports, and feeder ports for the east region in the recommended design for these two scenarios.

40|$|Abstract: PC {{clusters}} {{have become}} popular in parallel processing. They {{do not involve}} specialized inter-processor networks, so the latency of data communications is rather long. The programming models for PC clusters are often different than those for parallel machines or supercomputers containing sophisticated inter-processor communication networks. For PC clusters, load balancing among the nodes becomes a more critical issue in attempts to yield high performance. We introduce a new model for program development on PC clusters, namely the Super-Programming Model (SPM). The workload is modeled {{as a collection of}} Super-Instructions (SIs). We propose that a set of SIs be designed for each application domain. They should constitute an orthogonal set of frequently used high-level operations in the corresponding application domain. Each SI should normally be implemented as a high-level language routine that can execute on any PC. Application programs are modeled as Super-Programs (SPs), which are coded using SIs. SIs are dynamically assigned to available PCs at run time. Because of the known granularity of SIs, an upper bound on their execution time can be estimated at static time. Therefore, dynamic load balancing becomes an easier task. Our motivation is to support dynamic load <b>balancing</b> and code <b>porting,</b> especially for applications with diverse sets of inputs such as data mining. We apply here SPM to the implementation of an apriori-like algorithm for mining association rules. Our experiments show that the average idle time per node is kept very low...|$|R

These multiple input converters are capable enough in independent and simultaneous regulation {{of either of}} two ports whereas the third <b>port</b> <b>balances</b> the power in entire system. The Multiple input converter (MIC) instead of conventional converters has several advantages such as high efficiency, reduced conversion stages, lower cost, more compact packing, excellent management of the power among the ports and provides centralized control. The three port converter (TPC) topology based on dual input converter (DIC) or dual output converter (DOC) interfaces one PV panel as input source port, one synchronous battery port, and an output/load port. As there are numerous modes of operations, so independent power management in each port is a challenging task.

X band covers this work's frequency band 8 to 11 GHz, and can be used for electronic warfare, military satellite communications applications. In defense technology, electronic warfare is very important and promising subject to research. The selection of the dc quiescent point for the active device is very important issue before designing an amplifier. It also means determining operation class of the amplifier. A bias network is used to acquire the appropriate quiescent point for the active device under the specified operating conditions, and it maintains a constant setting irrespective of transistor parameter variations The various classes of device operation typically employed at microwave frequencies are defined as A, B, AB, C, D, E and F. The choice of the class depends majorly on the specific application that is intended for the amplifier. For example, due to design a broadband microwave amplifier designs, class A, B, or AB should be selected. D, E and F classes are high efficient switching topologies and widely used in power electronics applications. This thesis includes a brief information about A, B and AB types of operation classes for push-pull amplifier. Due to consider and acquire high efficiency and suitability to push-pull amplifier structure, class B is preferred. Although linearity of a class B amplifier is worse than a class A amplifier, its efficiency is much better. This causes decreasing the power consumption of the system which is very important for both power cost saving and heat dissipation which effects the system performance very negatively. Another important parameter that must be especially considered is linearity. In an ideal system, the output linearly changes with respect to the input. However, transfer function of an amplifier usually not as linear as desired in real world, because of distortive effects. Intermodulation signals can be dangerous if they are in the fundamental band, and cannot be easily filtered. Linearity must be increased to achieve high dynamic range operation. Some of important and widely used linearity criterions are P 1 dB, IP 3 and IP 2 are examined before design procedure. P 1 dB can be physically measured using a signal generator producing an appropriate signal which has enough amplitude for the sensitivity of the amplifier under test at desired frequency chosen from the operation bandwidth It is also seen that, there are some analytical relationships between these linearity criterions. For design procedure of the input and output balun, some balunstructure types are examined to determine which is more suitable for amplifier. The most common and widely used balun types are Bridge (Lattice) Balun, GuanellaBalun and Marchand Balun. It is seen that Bridge (Lattice) balun has low-pass, and Guanella balun has high-pass characteristics so they are not suitable for the 8 to 11 GHz application. Unlike Guanella or Bridge balun, Marchand balun has band-pass characteristics and is preffered for the input. Firstly, some literature research has done about Marchand balun to be sure about its functions are suitable for purpose. Marchand introduced the Marchand balun, which is designed using coaxial transmission lines, in 1944, and there are still studies done about implementation and developing this structure. Today, substrate technology is very sophisticate in comparison with 1940 s. Thus, current researchs are generally based on mictostrip, coplanar, stripline transmission lines. For required calculations, previous studies about Marchand Balun are used then the results are implemented on transmission line impedance calculation tool TX LINE in AWR DE MWO. After determining the type of input balun, the next issue is indicating the output balun structure. Due to transmit higher power at the output efficiently, 1 : 4 balun is chosen for output balun which is also perfectly suitable to use for class B amplifiers. Only one branch of the balun transmits the signal for each half cycle of the output signal, which leads combining the two signals with 180 -degree phase difference together. Another important stage is choosing transistor technology. There are many types of transistors widely used in similar applications such as silicon BJTs, silicon MOSFETs, GaAs MESFETs, InGaAs/InP HEMTs. As the active semiconductor elements, SiGe HBTs are employed in the class B push pull amplifier design due to its very high cut-off frequency. There is a differential amplifier with feedback due to adjust input impedance and besides that increase the total gain. Supply voltage of the structure is defined as 4 V according to characteristics of the chosen transistor model. Class B push-pull amplifier design with additional differential amplifier and input-output baluns is completed and results are achieved with AWR-DE MWO simulation program. 8 to 11 GHz push-pull Class B amplifier is designed with input and output balun structures due to make two <b>balanced</b> <b>port</b> network suitable to utilize in single ended systems. Network performance is highly increased by utilizing optimization tools in simulation program after combining all stages of design. Applying input and output baluns provides impedance matching and bandpass characteristic behaving like a resonant tank filtering even harmonics produced by push-pull amplifier. Differential amplifier at the first amplification stage provides higher gain, which helps increasing dynamic range of the cascaded amplifier. After research, calculations and optimizations, very satisfactory results are acquired according to simulation graphics. Gain is over 33 dB, output P 1 dB is 15 dBm, output IP 3 is 40 dBm, input reflection is very good (S 11 <- 10 dBm) within desired bandwidth 8 to 11 GHz. These results are very hard to achieve for X band, and promising for fabrication and implementation. After realizing the structure with lumped elements and getting good results, same network can be implemented as an integrated circuit using SiGe or some other semiconductor technology.

40|$|AbstractâPC {{clusters}} {{have become}} popular in parallel processing. They {{do not involve}} specialized interprocessor networks, so the latency of data communications is rather long. The programming models for PC clusters are often different than those for parallel machines or supercomputers containing sophisticated interprocessor communication networks. For PC clusters, load balancing among the nodes becomes a more critical issue in attempts to yield high performance. We introduce a new model for program development on PC clusters, namely, the Super-Programming Model (SPM). The workload is modeled {{as a collection of}} Super-Instructions (SIs). We propose that a set of SIs be designed for each application domain. They should constitute an orthogonal set of frequently used high-level operations in the corresponding application domain. Each SI should normally be implemented as a highlevel language routine that can execute on any PC. Application programs are modeled as Super-Programs (SPs), which are coded using SIs. SIs are dynamically assigned to available PCs at runtime. Because of the known granularity of SIs, an upper bound on their execution time can be estimated at static time. Therefore, dynamic load balancing becomes an easier task. Our motivation is to support dynamic load <b>balancing</b> and code <b>porting,</b> especially for applications with diverse sets of inputs such as data mining. We apply here SPM to the implementation of an Apriori-like algorithm for mining association rules. Our experiments show that the average idle time per node is kept very low.
