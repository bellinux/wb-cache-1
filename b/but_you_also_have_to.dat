5000|$|After Scorpions had {{finished}} the UK tour as special guest for Judas Priest, Rudolf Schenker revealed that band had started working on a live video album which would later become Unbreakable World Tour 2004: One Night in Vienna and also revealed that the band was planning to start {{working on a new}} album in late 2005. In an interview for the Malay Mail in May 2006, Schenker confirmed that the band was working on a new album which would have been hopefully released in late 2006 or early 2007. Describing the upcoming album, Schenker said: [...] "For now, I can only tell you that it's going to pick up where Unbreakable left off. It will have superb power ballads and hard-rocking songs playable on commercial radio. I guess you can say that the new Scorpions album is going to sound fresh and rocking. Also one more thing, it's {{going to be a great}} album and not an album with one or two great songs". Originally, the band had in mind to choose Dieter Dierks as album producer, but it did not work out because of a disagreement on the contract. After the planned collaboration with Dierks did not happen, Scorpions had in mind to produce album by themselves at Rudolf Schenker's Scorpio Sound Studio, but were afraid that their efforts might not be good enough. Schenker said: [...] "We knew we wanted to make a special record. We wanted to make sure that this album was going to be a masterpiece. When we do an album these days it has to be something special. If we only did it to make the fans happy - that’s one thing - <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make yourself happy." [...] Scorpions had been working intensively on the songs during the concerts in 2006 and invited several producers to come over to Germany for an interview (one of them was Roy Thomas Baker), but band members weren't really pleased with what producers had to offer, so in the end band decided to choose Desmond Child and James Michael as the producers of the new album. James Michael worked on the production of guitars, drums and bass. In October 2006, Scorpions band members went to Los Angeles to start recording the new material and during the next month and a half they worked on recording the basic tracks for the album. The band arrived there with 30 songs already written and soon after they began a second songwriting process. In the end of the second songwriting process, band had around 20 songs and many of those songs had a tone [...] "too dark" [...] from the lyrical standpoint, so band choose to eliminate many of the [...] "darker" [...] songs from the album and put in more optimistic songs. Among those songs are [...] "The Game of Life" [...] and [...] "You're Lovin' Me to Death". In order to make those songs fit the concept of the album, songwriting teams had to rewrite the lyrics and the choruses on those songs. During the first couple of weeks, the band was working together in a rehearsal space, every day for eight hours. After the rehearsals, they started to arrange and record in different studios in the Los Angeles area. Guitars were recorded in one studio with James Michael, while Klaus Meine's vocals were recorded with Desmond in another studio. Child also hired a vocal coach for Meine, to perform about an hour of vocal warm-up before the recording sessions. Matthias Jabs explained: [...] "Vocal cords are like muscles and you need to warm them up. Desmond was a visionary guy and knew if the vocalist is in good form, then he'll get what he wants from them". In the period between October 2006 and February 2007, band managed to record thirteen songs, of which twelve managed to make the album. Among the remaining 37 songs, several were recorded only as a demos.|$|E

40|$|Water {{rights in}} the Sahara Desert? CUE: What {{does it mean to}} have the right to water? Can a {{statement}} on water rights in a constitution achieve anything? And is it meaningful to tell people living in a dry area that they have a right to, for example, 20 litres of water per day, when that water may simply not exist? Virginia Roaf works for WaterAid, an international NGO that aims to improve the access of poor people to water and sanitation. Mike Davison went to the WaterAid office in London, and started by asking how useful she thought it was to give someone a right to water. IN: 		?The question of the right? OUT:		?coming from the local communities? DUR?N	 5 ? 08 BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Virginia Roaf of WaterAid describing some of the key issues raised by the right to water. Transcript Roaf	The question of the right to water is actually not as simple as it sounds. Everyone would agree that the right to water is a good right, it should be in the UN Declaration of Human Rights. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look at what is meant by the right to water, how much water, for whom, how clean is that water going to be? One of the problems of introducing a right to water is setting the standards that go with that. For example they might decide that everyone has a right to 20 litres per person per day. Now that?s obviously not going to be accessible to those people living in villages in rural areas, in the middle of the Sahara Desert for example, because that water is just not accessible; there isn?t that water in the ground. So setting a right to water which has unrealistic standards, you may actually find that the right to water works against the needs of the poorest. Maybe I can explain this best by looking at the right to housing. In South Africa the right to housing is enshrined in the constitution but along with that right to housing is also a long list of standards that are required to be met by that housing. For example they are to do with what the walls are to be made of, what the roof is to be made of. Now that?s obviously unaffordable to the poor who are presently living in shacks and in over crowded conditions. So while it?s a very good thing for the right to housing to be enshrined in the constitution it?s actually not accessible. Davison	So having that right to housing you would say is meaningless? Roaf	I think often it can be meaningless unless you?ve got a government that?s committed to creating the framework or the policies that will actually be able to deliver that housing. Davison	And if we were to carry that on to the example of the village in the Sahara Desert having a right to water, would you regard it in the same way? Roaf	Yes, I would say that rather than setting the standards for the right to water here in Britain or through the UN, I think it?s important to include local communities from poor areas, from developing countries, to ensure that the standards are not inaccessible. Davison	Do you think that if a country adds a statement on the right to water to its constitution, that is likely to help the poorer people who currently don?t have access to water? Roaf	I think that in some cases that will strengthen the poor community?s hand. I think it depends on whether the poor community is well organised and whether they know that they have the right to water. I think however that generally these rights that stand in the constitution become just words on a piece of paper and that they are actually more likely to protect the rights of the middle income people or the people in power than they are to protect the rights of the poor. Davison	Can you explain what you mean by that? Roaf	In Dhaka in Bangladesh a vast proportion of the population live in illegal settlements which they don?t have the rights to. It could be because it?s along the river bank or it?s on pavements or it?s on land which is ear-marked for other purposes, and the government is not willing to give land rights. There?s a community in an area called Tejganj where the people are living on a pavement adjacent to the factory where they are working. And they?ve been living there for maybe 25 or 30 years without access to adequate water and sanitation and the reason for that is the government is not prepared to provide water and sanitation to that community because they lack land title. So what WaterAid has done is actually to work with the community and they have negotiated with the local council, for the local council to give the community a 5 year, a short term lease, which will then allow the municipal supplier to actually provide water and sanitation. Interestingly this has caused a problem with the middle income community which lives opposite. The middle class community has decided that this is a threat to them and persuaded the local municipality to evict the community. Within a week the community were back living in that area because they had nowhere else to go. So they are actually now living in that area again and they are still obviously working in the factory. Davison	So that suggests that often when you get water rights you may well have a situation of conflict between two different groups? Roaf	There?s always going to be conflict over resources which are limited. The water supply in Dhaka probably reaches maybe 25 % of the population but obviously that?s going to be going to the richer parts of that community. And so if the middle class community see that the water is now being accessed by poorer communities obviously there?s going to be less water to go around. Davison	To me water rights would seem to be quite a western concept. To what extent do you think that the communities that WaterAid is working with feel that they have a right to water? Roaf	I think that the people living in Dhaka in Bangladesh through the work that they?ve been doing in accessing their right to land has actually introduced ideas of rights of water to those communities. Davison	So the increasing awareness of water rights has come through increasing awareness and interest in land rights? Roaf	I would say that there is more interest now in water rights, yes, because there?s been interest in land rights and the demand is coming from the local communities. End of tape.

Men of Hammersmith will not fail to remember that the very name of Kensington originated from the lips of their hero. For at the great banquet of reconciliation held after the war, when the disdainful oligarchs declined to join in the songs of the men of the Broadway (which are to this day of a rude and popular character), the great Republican leader, with his rough humour, said the words which are written in gold upon his monument, 'Little birds that can sing and won't sing, must be made to sing.' So that the Eastern Knights were called Cansings or Kensings ever afterwards. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> great memories, O men of Kensington! You showed that you could sing, and sing great war-songs. Even after the dark day of Kensington Gore, history will not forget those three Knights who guarded your disordered retreat from Hyde Park (so called from your hiding there), those three Knights after whom Knightsbridge is named. Nor will it forget the day of your re-emergence, purged in the fire of calamity, cleansed of your oligarchic corruptions, when, sword in hand, you drove the Empire of Hammersmith back mile by mile, swept it past its own Broadway, and broke it at last in a battle so long and bloody that the birds of prey have left their name upon it. Men have called it, with austere irony, the Ravenscourt. I shall not, I trust, wound the patriotism of Bayswater, or the lonelier pride of Brompton, or that of any other historic township, by taking these two special examples. I select them, not because they are more glorious than the rest, but partly from personal association (I am myself descended from one of the three heroes of Knightsbridge), and partly from the consciousness that I am an amateur antiquarian, and cannot presume to deal with times and places more remote and more mysterious. It is not for me to settle the question between two such men as Professor Hugg and Sir William Whisky as to whether Notting Hill means Nutting Hill (in allusion to the rich woods which no longer cover it), or whether it is a corruption of Nothing-ill, referring to its reputation among the ancients as an Earthly Paradise. When a Podkins and a Jossy confess themselves doubtful about the boundaries of West Kensington (said to have been traced in the blood of Oxen), I need not be ashamed to confess a similar doubt.

I wanted to finish this degree to serve as an example for you in your own journey toward your dreams and goals in life. Thank you for all of your unconditional love – Dad loves you! Mom, you have always served as an educational and professional role model for me. You have taught me many lessons about how to work with and lead others...|$|R

[...] "You have all done not so badly," [...] he would say. [...] "But you shall {{remember}} {{that it is not}} enough to have the method, and the art, and the power, nor even that which is touch, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>also</b> the conviction that nails the work to the wall. Of the so many I taught,"--here the students would begin to unfix drawing-pins or get their tubes together,--"the very so many that I have taught, the best was Binat. All that comes of the study and the work and the knowledge was to him even when he came. After he left me he should have done all that could be done with the colour, the form, and the knowledge. Only, he had not the conviction. So today I hear no more of Binat,--the best of my pupils,--and that is long ago. So today, too, you will be glad to hear no more of me. Continuez, mesdemoiselles, and, above all, with conviction." ...|$|R

While the first day in is, with no doubt, the most eagerly anticipated, the rest of the days are equally enjoyable. IET life is full of all sorts of activities. You will get an exposure to a range of fields such as drama, theatre, music, choreography and photography. IET life is full of fun. Students are unanimous over the fact that in college you create friends for life. Memories that last a lifetime. Friends make each instant of college life valuable. Be it the chat sessions in the canteen, sharing dreams and despair or even attending classes, we are all in it together. <b>Also,</b> <b>you</b> get to meet friends from crosswise the IET. Students share a common platform and further exchange their opinions, behavior and culture. However, as a fresher, you should be cautious about a little things. Even though you are usually part of a group, you have to maintain your uniqueness and never give in to peer stress. You should never be a room potato and shy away from seniors or treat college fests as free holidays or preparatory leave. Freshers should make it a point to network with people and participate in as many college and extra co-curricular activities as you can. Remember. In IET, you will meet lots of people. There will be clubs, teams, parties, volunteer activities, lectures, movies, concerts, etc. You will probably have more job than you have ever <b>had,</b> <b>but</b> <b>you</b> will <b>also</b> <b>have</b> free time. <b>Also,</b> college experience alters and redefines your perception of life.You lose your high school pretentiousness and realise that in the better picture.IET <b>also</b> helps <b>you</b> to shed inhibitions and strike conversations with random people on random topics, in short it enhances a student's communication skills. When you join IET, it is quite normal to feel nervous, uncertain and lacks basic communication skills. But all that will change. IET life also exposes students to a range of career opportunities that lie ahead. It is in IET that you create gaining experience through various internships and jobs and gain valuable insight into the way the professional environment works. This <b>also</b> enables <b>you</b> to be a part of a broader network.|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{designed}} {{for use in a}} class offered here at Ball State University. The class it {{was designed}} for is Zoology 330, as is now taught by my advisor Dr. Clare Chatot. In the lab for this class a large-scale dissection is taken on, in which the major animal dissected is the cat. When I had this class some odd years ago I remember feeling that the dissection was a very challenging part of the course. At the time we had two references at our disposal, the teacher and lab books. This is where the idea for the video came in. The video presented here is a reference of every muscle that has to be learned on the cat in the class mentioned above. The book that is with it serves to combat a different challenge of the class. In the class not only do you have to learn what the muscles are and where they are, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to know from where they originated, where they insert, and exactly what they do. To do this when I took the class we, the students had to look in other books than our lab books. This presented a problem because often times different books would call the same muscle by different names, making a confusing task even more confusing. The book part of this thesis has the muscles pictured in color, not available in the lab before, and has the muscle origins, insertions, and actions clearly lay out in tables. With the background of this thesis given here it should be easy to see why this thesis was constructed. Honors CollegeThesis (B. S. ...|$|R
