50|$|Local {{pressure}} (at the {{crankshaft journal}} and bearing) is {{far higher than}} the 50, 60 psi &c. set by the pump’s relief valve, and will reach hundreds of psi. This higher pressure is developed by the relative speeds in feet per second (not RPM or journal size directly) of the crankshaft journal itself against the bearing, the bearing width (to the closest pressure leak), oil viscosity, and temperature, balanced against the <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance</b> (the leakage rate).|$|E

All engines are “open systems”, because the oil returns to the pan by a series of controlled leaks. The bearings farthest from the pump always have the lowest pressure {{because of the number of}} leaks between the pump and that bearing.

50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of the}} accident was {{the failure of the}} 18th rail car to properly negotiate a curve because of the inadequate side <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance</b> of the B-end truck assembly, likely due to a broken side bearing wedge plate attachment bolt, which caused a wheel to climb the rail, which derailed the car.

40|$|Abstract − In this Part II study, rotordynamic {{stability}} {{analyses were}} carried out to confirm improvements to the stability of a process high-speed lightweight centrifugal compressor, depending {{on the effects of}} tilting pad jour-nal bearing designs. The bearing design variables considered were the clearances, LBPs, LOPs, and preloads. The results showed that the rotordynamic stability of the subject compressor rotor-bearing system improves exactly in accordance with the effects of the bearing design variables, which were determined in the preceding Part I study, owing to reduced bearing stiffnesses. Specifically, it was confirmed that the stability of the rotor system can be greatly improved by increasing both the machined and assembled <b>bearing</b> <b>clearances,</b> but there were no stability improvements by simply changing from an LBP to an LOP design. In addition, it was confirmed that for given fixed machined <b>bearing</b> <b>clearances,</b> the stability can be additionally improved by decreasing the pre-loads, i. e., by increasing the assembled clearances. In conclusion, {{it may be necessary to}} improve the designs of the original tilting pad bearings to obtain a sufficient margin of rotordynamic stability against a possible aero-dynamic cross-coupled stiffness in a process high-speed centrifugal compressor. Thus, increasing the machined and assembled <b>bearing</b> <b>clearances</b> and decreasing the preload could be effective solutions...|$|R
40|$|Tooth {{separation}} and wedging remain key concerns in planetary gears sets design. These {{may lead to}} anomalous in-service conditions and cause premature tooth damage and bearings failure. Damage is related to planets loads sharing which in turn depends on assembly errors and functional parameters of the used design solutions.

The analysis focuses planetary gears sets used in wind power plants where these issues are particularly crucial. The effects of randomly distributed <b>bearings</b> <b>clearances</b> and misalignments are investigated using a simplified probabilistic approach. The study, carried out by means of a two-dimensional lumped-parameter model enabling both tooth {{separation and}} wedging, demonstrates a significant impact of the non uniform clearances distributions and assembly errors on the load sharing...|$|R
5000|$|For in-line 4's {{there are}} 3 types of crankshaft. No counter weights, fully counter {{weighted}} (FCW) and semi-counter or half-counter weighted (SCW/HCW). Cranks without counter weights ("bent sticks") were used on in-line 4's {{up to the}} mid 1930s for auto-mobiles but are still {{to be found in}} agricultural use with attendant problems. Without counter weights an in-line 4 crank is balanced for primary forces, primary and secondary couples but not for secondary forces. Secondary force out balance can not be balanced on the crank, requiring 2 contra-rotating balance shafts running at twice engine speed. These will only be fitted on premium quality cars that demand very smooth running or on large engines in excess of 2.4L where the level of secondary vibration becomes obtrusive. The primary couples bend the crank to a S shape with the deflection increasing with rpm. Without counter weights this deflection causes fatigue and main bearing failures when the deflection exceeds the <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance</b> resulting in rubs. These failures have resulted in a public perception that high rpm is bad for the engine that lingers to this day. FCW cranks have 2 counter weights on each crank throw. SCW cranks have one counter weight on each crank throw, these are on each end of the crank and both sides of the centre main. The counter weights produce moment couples in the crank that counter the primary couple and pull the crank straighter to enable repeated and sustained high rpm with long fatigue and bearing life. The moment couple is proportional to mass x radius of centre of gravity x distance from pivot, the [...] "pivots" [...] being between 1-2 and 3-4. As they are close to the [...] "pivot", the counter weights adjacent to the pivots on a FCW crank only contribute about 1/4 to 1/3 of the moment. The counter weights balance each other completely for primary forces and couples and have no secondary forces/couple. Counter weights do not affect overall engine balance and vibration. There is no benefit in having FCW crank over SCW. The SCW crank is always lighter and allows more rapid engine and vehicle acceleration but may need a heavier flywheel. FCW cranks are used on engines to save space as the piston has to clear the counter weight at bottom dead centre, SCW although only 25-33% larger to obtain the required couple would make the engine taller and the crankcase wider. For automotive use the switch from SCW to FCW is typically around 1.8-2.2L engine capacity. There are a few [...] "hybrid" [...] cranks (Nissan Z22, LD20), these have large counter weights in the SCW position that are as big as the crankcase and piston clearance permits and small counterweights in the remaining positions to produce the required couple. This gives the lightest crank that the crankcase space permits.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{influences}} of the <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance,</b> which is a common fault for machines, to the chatter stability of milling process are examined by using numerical simulation method. The results reveal {{that the presence of}} <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance</b> could make the milling process easier to enter the status of chatter instability and can shift the chatter frequency. In addition, the spectra analysis to vibration signals obtained under the instable milling processes show that the presence of <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance</b> could introduce more frequency components to the vibration responses but, however, under both the stable and instable milling processes, the generated frequency components will not violate the ideal spectra structures of the vibration responses of the milling process, which are usually characterized by the tooth passing frequency and its associated higher harmonics for the stable milling process and by the complex coupling of the tooth passing frequency and the chatter frequency for the instable milling process. This implies that, even under the case with <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance</b> fault, the stability of the milling process can still be determined by viewing the frequency spectra of the vibration responses. Moreover, the phenomena of the chatter frequency shift and the generation of more components provide potential ways to detect the <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance</b> in machines. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A computationally efficient convolution method, based on discretized Duhamel and transition matrix integral formulations, is developed for the transient analysis. In the formulation, the coupling forces due to the nonlinearities are treated as external forces acting on the coupled subsystems. Iteration is utilized to determine their magnitudes at each time increment. The method is applied to a nonlinear generic model of the high pressure oxygen turbopump (HPOTP). As compared to the fourth order Runge-Kutta numerical integration methods, the convolution approach proved to be more accurate and more highly efficient. For determining the nonlinear, steady-state periodic responses, an incremental harmonic balance method was also developed. The method was successfully used to determine dominantly harmonic and subharmonic responses fo the HPOTP generic model with <b>bearing</b> <b>clearances.</b> A reduction method similar to the impedance formulation utilized with linear systems is used to reduce the housing-rotor models to their coordinates at the <b>bearing</b> <b>clearances.</b> Recommendations are included for further development of the method, for extending the analysis to aperiodic and chaotic regimes and for conducting critical parameteric studies of the nonlinear response of the current SSME turbopumps...|$|R

40|$|A {{completely}} {{new type of}} externally pressurized gas thrust bearing is proposed and its static characteristics are analyzed. Unlike conventional gas bearings whose load capacity depends on the viscosity of gas, the load capacity of this new type of bearing is independent of the viscosity of gas since it utilizes the choking phenomenon of gas flow to maintain high pressure in the <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance.</b> Also the change of {{the location of the}} throat generates bearing stiffness. Since the flow is supersonic at the exit of the <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance,</b> the flow conditions downstream of the exit do not affect the flow inside the <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance.</b> Accordingly, the load capacity increases proportionally to the supply pressure. Thus, the main disad-vantage of conventional gas bearings, namely, the deficiency of their load capacity is overcome. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{computational}} work investigates {{planetary gear}} load sharing of three-mount suspension wind turbine gearboxes. A three dimensional multibody dynamic model is established, including gravity, bending moments, fluctuating mesh stiffness, nonlinear tooth contact, and <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance.</b> A flexible main shaft, planetary carrier, housing, and gear shafts are modeled using reduced degrees-of-freedom through modal compensation. This drivetrain model is validated against the experimental data of Gearbox Reliability Collaborative for gearbox internal loads. Planet load sharing is a combined effect of gravity, bending moment, <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance,</b> and input torque. Influences {{of each of}} these parameters and their combined effects on the resulting planet load sharing are investigated. Bending moments and gravity induce fundamental excitations in the rotating carrier frame, which can increase gearbox internal loads and disturb load sharing. Clearance in carrier bearings reduces the bearing load carrying capacity and thus the bending moment from the rotor can be transmitted into gear meshes. With <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance,</b> the bending moment can cause tooth micropitting and can induce planet bearing fatigue, leading to reduced gearbox life.
