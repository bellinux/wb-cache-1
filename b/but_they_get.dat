500|$|Born in Weatherfield, Mavis {{was brought}} up in Grange-over-Sands where her parents, despite being teetotal, ran an off-licence.

[...] It said that there had been an overall improvement in the fourth season, and that [...] "this could become some of the best Star Trek ever made". It gave [...] "Kir'Shara" [...] a rating of four and a half out of five. In Matthew Kappell's book Star Trek As Myth, he said that he felt that the revelation that the previous Vulcan administration was working with the Romulans all along [...] "suddenly makes sense of years of previously incomprehensible Vulcan policy" [...] and linked to The Next Generation episode [...] "".|$|E
500|$|The {{great white}} shark {{is one of only}} a few sharks known to {{regularly}} lift its head above the sea surface to gaze at other objects such as prey. This is known as spy-hopping. This behavior has also been seen in at least one group of blacktip reef sharks, but this might be learned from interaction with humans (it is theorized that the shark may also be able to smell better this way because smell travels through air faster than through water). White sharks are generally very curious animals, display intelligence and may also turn to socializing if the situation demands it. At Seal Island, white sharks have been observed arriving and departing in stable [...] "clans" [...] of two to six individuals on a yearly basis. Whether clan members are related is unknown <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> along peacefully enough. In fact, the social structure of a clan is probably most aptly compared to that of a wolf pack; in that each member has a clearly established rank and each clan has an alpha leader. When members of different clans meet, they establish social rank nonviolently through any of a variety of interactions.|$|E

500|$|The {{evolution}} of the power structure within the Germanic societies in Poland and elsewhere {{can be traced to}} some degree by examining the [...] "princely" [...] graves - burials of chiefs, and even hereditary princes, as the consolidation of power progressed. Those appear {{from the beginning of the}} Common Era and are located away from ordinary cemeteries, singly or in small groups. The bodies were inhumed in wooden coffins and covered with kurgans, or interred in wooden or stone chambers. Luxurious Roman-made gifts and fancy barbarian emulations (such as silver and gold clasps with springs, created with an unsurpassed attention to detail, dated 3rd century AD from Wrocław Zakrzów), but not weapons, were placed in the graves. The 1st and 2nd century burials of this type, occurring all the way from Jutland to Lesser Poland, are referred to as princely graves Lubieszewo type, after Lubieszewo, Gryfice County in western Pomerania, where six such burials were found. On the 3rd and 4th century sites two types of princely graves are distinguished. The Zakrzów type, named after the location of three very rich stone chamber burials found in Wrocław Zakrzów occur in southern Poland, while in the northern and central parts of the country the Rostołty (Białystok County) type kurgans are rather common. At some sites, believed to be dynastic necropolises, the princes were buried in generation long time increments. During the late Roman period the princely burials are fewer in number, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> increasingly more elaborate.|$|E
