40|$|Abstract. External {{uniqueness}} is {{a surprising}} {{new way to}} add <b>unique</b> <b>references</b> to an OOPL. The idea is that an externally <b>unique</b> <b>reference</b> is the only reference into an aggregate from outside the aggregate. Internal references which do not escape the boundary of the aggregate are innocuous and therefore permitted. Based on ownership types, our proposal not only overcomes an abstraction problem from which existing uniqueness proposals suffer, it also enables many examples which are inherently not unique, such as a <b>unique</b> <b>reference</b> {{to a set of}} links in a doubly-linked list, without losing the benefits of uniqueness. ...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{approaches}} to adding <b>unique</b> <b>references</b> to object-oriented programming languages suffer from two problems, which we identify in this paper: the abstraction {{problem and the}} orthogonality problem. To counter these problems, we propose an alternative: external uniqueness. The idea is that an externally <b>unique</b> <b>reference</b> is the only reference into an aggregate object from outside the aggregate. An externally <b>unique</b> <b>reference</b> is the only active reference to an object, and is thus effectively unique. We present a formal account of external uniqueness which relies essentially on deep ownership types, and, by demonstrating {{that it does not}} suffer from the two problems, argue that it is better suited to object-oriented programming than conventional uniqueness. We also discuss a third problem, the definitional problem, which we cannot yet address satisfactorily...|$|R
40|$|A robust {{fingerprint}} recognition algorithm should {{tolerate the}} rotation and {{translation of the}} fingerprint image. One popular solution is to consistently detect a <b>unique</b> <b>reference</b> point and compute a <b>unique</b> <b>reference</b> orientation for translational and rotational alignment. This paper develops an effective algorithm to locate a reference point and compute the corresponding reference orientation consistently and accurately {{for all types of}} fingerprints. To compute the reliable orientation field, an improved orientation smoothing method is proposed based on adaptive neighborhood. It shows better performance in filtering noise while maintaining the orientation localization than the conventional averaging method. The reference-point localization is based on multiscale analysis of the orientation consistency to search the local minimum. The <b>unique</b> <b>reference</b> orientation is computed based on the analysis of the orientation differences between the radial directions from the reference point, which are the directions of the radii emitted from the reference point with equivalent angle interval, and the local ridge orientations along these radii. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can consistently locate a <b>unique</b> <b>reference</b> point and compute the reference orientation with high accuracy for all types of fingerprints. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Unique</b> object <b>references</b> {{have many}} {{important}} applications in object-oriented programming. For instance, with su cient encapsulation properties they enable safe and e cient transfer of message objects between concurrent processes. However, it is a long-standing challenge to integrate <b>unique</b> <b>references</b> into practical object-oriented programming languages. This paper introduces {{a new approach}} to external uniqueness. The idea is to use capabilities for enforcing both aliasing constraints that guarantee external uniqueness, and linear consumption of <b>unique</b> <b>references.</b> We formalize our approach as a type system, and prove a type preservation theorem. Type safety rests on an alias invariant that builds on a novel formalization of external uniqueness. We show how a capability-based type system can be used to integrate external uniqueness into widely available object-oriented programming languages. Practical experience suggests that our system allows adding uniqueness information to common collection classes in a simple and concise way. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} {{application of}} <b>unique</b> object <b>references</b> {{is safe and}} efficient message passing in concurrent object-oriented programming. However, to prevent the ill effects of aliasing, practical systems often severely restrict the shape of messages passed by reference. Moreover, the problematic interplay between destructive reads–often used to implement unique references–and temporary aliasing through “borrowed ” references is exacerbated in a concurrent setting, increasing the potential for unpredictable run-time errors. This paper introduces {{a new approach to}} uniqueness. The idea is to use capabilities for enforcing both at-most-once consumption of <b>unique</b> <b>references,</b> and a flexible notion of uniqueness. The main novelty of our approach is a model of uniqueness and borrowing based on simple, unstructured capabilities. The advantages are: first, it provides simple foundations for uniqueness and borrowing. Second, it can be formalized using a relatively simple type system, for which we provide a complete soundness proof. Third, it avoids common problems involving borrowing and destructive reads, since <b>unique</b> <b>references</b> subsume borrowed references. We have implemented our type system as an extension to Scala. Practical experience suggests that our system allows type checking real-world actor-based concurrent programs with {{only a small number of}} additional type annotations. ...|$|R
