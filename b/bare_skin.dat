5|$|Also defined herewith: orbital ring. A visible ring of {{feathers}} around a bird's eye; the eye-ring is often paler than the surrounding feathers. By contrast, an orbital ring is <b>bare</b> <b>skin</b> ringing the eye. In some species, such as little ringed plover, the orbital ring {{may be quite}} conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|Immature American {{white and}} scarlet ibises are very {{difficult}} to tell apart, although scarlet ibises tend to have darker legs and <b>bare</b> <b>skin</b> around the face. An immature American white ibis could be mistaken for an immature glossy ibis, but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump. The adult is distinguishable from the wood stork, which is much larger and its wings have more black on them.|$|E
5|$|The {{juvenile}} {{resembles the}} adult in plumage, but the areas {{corresponding to the}} adult black feathers are browner and less glossy. The scapulars, wing and upper tail coverts have pale tips. The legs, bill and <b>bare</b> <b>skin</b> around the eyes are greyish green. It could possibly {{be confused with the}} juvenile yellow-billed stork, but the latter has paler wings and mantle, a longer bill and white under the wings.|$|E
60|$|The {{work was}} to be done entirely by diving, {{as a matter of}} course; and since the laborers would be out of the water a greater portion of the time, the old sailor's advice was very good. To expose their <b>bare</b> <b>skins</b> to the fervent rays of the sun and the attacks of insects would cause great suffering.|$|R

5|$|Females {{are easily}} {{distinguished}} from males {{as they have}} a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller cere and nostrils, more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not {{very different from that}} of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. They tend to resist more and be more aggressive than the male when handled. Nesting females also have a brood patch on the <b>bare</b> <b>skin</b> of the belly.|$|E
5|$|Generally duller and paler, {{the female}} {{has a more}} uniform and paler blue face, with highly {{contrasting}} cream <b>bare</b> <b>skin</b> around the eye. It lacks the red shoulder band, and the blue shoulder markings are darker and less distinct. The throat and chest are pale green and the belly is yellow. The upper mandible is paler brown-grey with a darker tip, and has been recorded as black while nesting. The lower mandible is pale grey to almost white. When flying, the female has a broad white bar visible on the underwing.|$|E
5|$|Some {{versions}} of the original Soulcalibur arcade game censored Ivy's default costume by covering her <b>bare</b> <b>skin</b> with a lavender catsuit. With Soulcalibur IV, Ivy's look on the promotional artwork was modified on the English website to hide her undercleavage, leading to suspicion of censorship in the American release of the game. When asked about the censoring, director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated he had heard of {{nothing of the sort}} having taken place. When released in North America it was shown that no actual censorship had occurred within the game.|$|E

50|$|The barred dove {{is similar}} to the zebra dove in {{appearance}} but has <b>bare</b> yellow <b>skin</b> around the eye and black-and-white barring which extends right across the breast and belly.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bare</b> facial <b>skin</b> is black, {{becoming}} ruddy {{behind the}} yellow eye. The upper mandible {{of the bill}} is bright orange, the lower mandible is black, and the legs are green.|$|R
5|$|The female {{develops}} a brood patch of <b>bare</b> <b>skin</b> and plays {{the main part}} in incubating the eggs. The male helps, but can only cover the eggs rather than truly incubate them. The female spends the night incubating during this period, while the male roosts near the nest. Eggs hatch at the same time, after a short incubation period lasting 11–14days, and exceptionally {{for as many as}} 17 or as few as 9. The length of the incubation period decreases as ambient temperature increases later in the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper parts}} are {{generally}} light greyish brown with dark brown centres to the feathers, giving {{the appearance of}} stripes. These stripes are marked {{on the head and}} nape, less distinct on the rump and almost absent from the upper tail coverts. The underparts are whitish with faint streaks on the belly. The feathers of the upper breast and throat are long and pointed, giving the head a spiky appearance. The wing and tail are both moderately long with rounded tips. The bill is short, with a sharp pointed appearance, dark blue-grey grading to a grey-black at the tip and around the nostrils. Legs and feet are blue-grey with black claws. The <b>bare</b> <b>skin</b> around the eye is dark brown and the iris a dark black-brown.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{resemble}} adults, {{but lack}} throat hackles, and sometimes have a pink fleshy gape. The bill is shorter and shallower; its base can be pinkish and the tip can be light grey. The plumage is more ruffled and softer in appearance, lacks the glossy highlights and often having a brown tinge. The <b>bare</b> <b>skin</b> on the throat is pink in bird that have recently left the nest. Eye colour varies with age, gradually lightening from juvenile to adult. Nestlings {{up to four}} months old have blue-grey irises, juveniles aged from four to fifteen months have dark brown irises, and immature birds have hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months. Immature birds older than one year develop hackles, while some pink remains in the gape until the bird is {{two or three years}} of age.|$|E
50|$|They are {{strongly}} sexually dimorphic. Males have an {{at least partially}} white plumage, and facial wattles or <b>bare</b> facial <b>skin.</b> Females lack the wattles/bare facial skin, and are overall olive with yellowish streaks below.|$|R
2500|$|Spix's macaw {{is easy to}} {{identify}} being the only small blue macaw and also by the <b>bare</b> grey facial <b>skin</b> of its lores and eyerings. It is about [...] long including tail length of [...] It has a wing length of [...] The external appearance of adult male and female are identical; however, the average weight of captive males is about [...] and captive females average about [...] Its plumage is grey-blue on the head, pale blue on the underparts, and vivid blue on the upperparts, wings and tail. The legs and feet are brownish-black. In adults the <b>bare</b> facial <b>skin</b> is grey, the beak is entirely dark grey, and the irises are yellow. Juveniles are similar to adults, but the <b>bare</b> facial <b>skin</b> is pale grey, the irises are brown, {{and they have a}} white stripe along the center of the top of the beak (along the culmen).|$|R
50|$|The males exhibit vivid crimson red {{legs and}} <b>bare</b> facial <b>skin</b> and {{striking}} {{black and white}} dorsal plumage that extends to its head. There is also extensive white ocellation on the sepia wings and upperback.|$|R
5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the specimen was either a runt of either the yellow-breasted fruit dove or a Treron pigeon, or a hybrid instead of a unique species; however, these views are generally considered invalid {{due in part to the}} distinctiveness of the specimen, particularly in the <b>bare</b> <b>skin</b> around the eye, and no proper evidence has suggested that the Negros fruit dove is an invalid species. It is uncertain where the dove should be placed within the genus Ptilinopus as the male's plumage, a key feature used in organizing the Ptilinopus doves, is unknown. It has been suggested that the Negros fruit dove is either most closely related to the black-naped fruit dove or represents an early colonization of the Philippines by the genus that has left no surviving close relatives. It has no known subspecies and is also known as Ripley's fruit dove.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren {{is notable}} for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue and chestnut contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown, ear tufts and upper back are prominently featured in breeding displays. The male in breeding plumage has a silvery blue crown, ear coverts and upper back, a black throat and nape, bright red-brown shoulders, a long grey-brown tail and wings, and greyish-white belly. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour, though males may retain traces of blue and black plumage. All males have a black bill and lores (eye-ring and <b>bare</b> <b>skin</b> between eyes and bill), while females have a black bill, rufous lores and pale grey eye-ring. Immature males will develop black lores by six weeks of age and generally moult into an incomplete breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching. This has a patchy or spotty appearance, {{with a mixture of}} blue and grey feathers on the head, and black and grey on the breast; birds born early in the breeding season will gain more nuptial plumage initially than those born late. Most perfect their nuptial moult by their second spring, though some may need another year. Several males have been observed in breeding plumage in a single group at the same time, although it is unknown if or how this is related to dominance or breeding status.|$|E
5|$|Strickland and Melville {{established}} that the dodo was anatomically similar to pigeons in many features. They pointed to the very short keratinous portion of the beak, with its long, slender, naked basal part. Other pigeons also have <b>bare</b> <b>skin</b> around their eyes, almost reaching their beak, as in dodos. The forehead was high {{in relation to the}} beak, and the nostril was located low on the middle of the beak and surrounded by skin, a combination of features shared only with pigeons. The legs of the dodo were generally more similar to those of terrestrial pigeons than of other birds, both in their scales and in their skeletal features. Depictions of the large crop hinted at a relationship with pigeons, in which this feature is more developed than in other birds. Pigeons generally have very small clutches, and the dodo is said to have laid a single egg. Like pigeons, the dodo lacked the vomer and septum of the nostrils, and it shared details in the mandible, the zygomatic bone, the palate, and the hallux. The dodo differed from other pigeons mainly in the small size of the wings and the large size of the beak in proportion {{to the rest of the}} cranium.|$|E
50|$|The bill is stout and strong, {{yellowish}} overall with a dusky upper mandible. The <b>bare</b> facial <b>skin</b> {{is bright}} yellow, with a brown line {{running across the}} lores. The legs are greenish-yellow, and the iris is yellow.|$|R
50|$|Spix's macaw {{is easy to}} {{identify}} being the only small blue macaw and also by the <b>bare</b> grey facial <b>skin</b> of its lores and eyerings. It is about 56 cm long including tail length of 26 - 38 cm. It has a wing length of 24.7 - 30.0 cm. The external appearance of adult male and female are identical; however, the average weight of captive males is about 318 g and captive females average about 288 g. Its plumage is grey-blue on the head, pale blue on the underparts, and vivid blue on the upperparts, wings and tail. The legs and feet are brownish-black. In adults the <b>bare</b> facial <b>skin</b> is grey, the beak is entirely dark grey, and the irises are yellow. Juveniles are similar to adults, but the <b>bare</b> facial <b>skin</b> is pale grey, the irises are brown, {{and they have a}} white stripe along the center of the top of the beak (along the culmen).|$|R
5|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, the typical male's {{head and neck}} decorations and the <b>bare</b> facial <b>skin</b> are lost and the legs and bill become duller. The upperparts are grey-brown, and the underparts are white with grey mottling on the breast and flanks.|$|R
5|$|The plumage of the {{cockatoos}} is less brightly coloured {{than that}} of the other parrots, with species generally being either black, grey or white. Many species have smaller areas of colour on their plumage, often yellow, pink and red, usually on the crest or tail. The galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo are more broadly coloured in pink tones. Several species have a brightly coloured bare area around the eye and face known as a periophthalmic ring; the large red patch of <b>bare</b> <b>skin</b> of the palm cockatoo is the most extensive and covers some of the face, while it is more restricted in some other species of white cockatoo, notably the corellas and blue-eyed cockatoo. The plumage of males and females is similar in most species. The plumage of the female cockatiel is duller than the male, but the most marked sexual dimorphism occurs in the gang-gang cockatoo and the two species of black cockatoos in the subgenus Calyptorhynchus, namely the red-tailed and glossy black cockatoos. The iris colour differs in a few species, being pink or red in the female galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo and red-brown in some other female white cockatoo species. The males all have dark brown irises.|$|E

25|$|Cultural and/or {{religious}} traditions usually dictate what is proper {{and what is}} not socially acceptable. Many non-Western cultures allow women to breastfeed in public, while some have very strict laws about showing any <b>bare</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The crested coua (Coua cristata) is a medium-sized, {{approximately}} 44 cm long, greenish-grey coua with grey crest, blue <b>bare</b> orbital <b>skin,</b> rufous breast, brown iris, black {{bill and}} legs, white belly and long white-tipped purplish-blue tail feathers. They are very attractive birds.|$|R
50|$|Common comfort {{movements}} in the milky stork include allopreening between breeding partners and head shaking. Individuals perched near incubating partners also carrying out head rubbing, whereby the stork oils the <b>bare</b> head <b>skin</b> on its preen gland and then rubs its head on its plumage.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bare</b> facial <b>skin</b> is black, {{becoming}} ruddy {{behind the}} yellow eye. The upper mandible {{of the bill}} is dull yellow, marked with a black saw-tooth pattern on the cutting edge, and a black tip. The lower mandible is black, and the legs are green.|$|R
25|$|The females {{also produce}} {{offspring}} after they mate with a male, laying eggs on trees, shrubs, rocks, vehicles, and plants of many types. She typically lays about 500 eggs. The eggs {{are covered with}} a peachy fuzz that can cause serious rashes if touched by <b>bare</b> <b>skin</b> or fur. Then the female leaves to eat, while her eggs are protected. She does not live to see her offspring.|$|E
25|$|The preorbital gland is a paired {{exocrine gland}} {{found in many}} species of hoofed animals, which is {{homologous}} to the lacrimal gland found in humans. These glands are trenchlike slits of dark blue to black, nearly <b>bare</b> <b>skin</b> extending from the medial canthus of each eye. They are lined {{by a combination of}} sebaceous and sudoriferous glands, and they produce secretions which contain pheromones and other semiochemical compounds. Ungulates frequently deposit these secretions on twigs and grass as a means of communication with other animals.|$|E
25|$|Laurent {{took a few}} steps, not speaking. He {{removed his}} jacket and vest. In shirtsleeves, he glanced again at Thérèse, who had not stirred. He seemed to hesitate. Then he noticed the pink shoulder, and bent down to press his {{trembling}} lips against that bit of <b>bare</b> <b>skin.</b> The young woman pulled her shoulder away, turning around abruptly. She stared at Laurent with a gaze so strangely mingling repugnance and dread that he stepped back, troubled and uneasy, as if overcome with terror and disgust himself.|$|E
5000|$|The little friarbird can {{be easily}} {{distinguished}} from other friarbirds {{by the absence of}} a casque (a prominent ridge or bump present on the beak). Another key recognisable feature is the <b>bare</b> blue <b>skin</b> present under the eye which widens over the cheek (The <b>bare</b> blue <b>skin</b> can be grey to black in tone). Dark feathers are present both above and below the blue skin. The top of the head and body are a dark grey-brown with a dull white fringe present on the nape which flows around to a wide patch {{on the side of the}} neck. Fine silky white feathers are present under the chin with silvery white streaks flowing down the breast merging to pale grey for the under body of the little friarbird.|$|R
50|$|The male is very dark, {{grey and}} black with {{numerous}} white spots, each spot bordered {{with black and}} deep crimson patches on the sides and back of the neck. The throat is <b>bare</b> with blue <b>skin</b> while the <b>bare</b> facial <b>skin</b> is red. They have a small black occipital crest. Females have pale brownish-grey upper parts finely vermiculated and spotted with black, {{and most of the}} feathers have black patches and central white streaks. Immature males resemble females, but are larger with longer legs and a variable amount of black on the head and red on neck.|$|R
50|$|It is 25-38 cm in length, with a {{significant}} size difference between the subspecies, {{of which there are}} some seven or eight. It is a generally dark francolin, brown above and black-streaked grey or white underparts. The bill, <b>bare</b> facial <b>skin,</b> neck and legs are bright red.|$|R
