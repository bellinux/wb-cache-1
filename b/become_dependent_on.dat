5|$|At {{some point}} during the 1990s, it {{appeared}} that Jackson had <b>become</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> prescription drugs, mainly painkillers and strong sedatives. The drug use was later linked to second- and third-degree burns he had suffered years before. As more and more difficulty emerged in his life, he gradually became dependent on these drugs, and his health deteriorated. He went into rehabilitation in 1993 with the help of Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John.|$|E

Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. In the mid-20th century, a gathering environmental movement {{pointed out that there}} were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed.

5|$|The diet of the yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} is {{varied and}} available {{from a range}} of habitats within its distribution, which reduces their vulnerability to degradation or change in habitat. Much of the diet comprises seeds of native trees, particularly she-oaks (Allocasuarina and Casuarina, including A.torulosa and A.verticillata), but also Eucalyptus (including E.maculata flowers and E.nitida seeds), Acacia (including gum exudate and galls), Banksia (including the green seed pods and seeds of B.serrata, B.integrifolia, and B.marginata), and Hakea species (including H.gibbosa, H.rugosa, H.nodosa, H.sericea, H.cycloptera, and H.dactyloides). They are also partial to pine cones in plantations of the introduced Pinus radiata and to other introduced trees, including Cupressus torulosa, Betula pendula and the buds of elm Ulmus species. In the Eyre Peninsula, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo has <b>become</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> the introduced Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), alongside native species.|$|E
5|$|Tchernov {{argued that}} the house sparrow and related species have {{undergone}} considerable morphological changes in adapting to a commensal relationship with humans, with the beak becoming longer and narrower. He wrote that P.predomesticus was intermediate between the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow (Passer hispaniolensis), and suggested {{that it may be}} a primitive relative of the ancestor of the house sparrow that did not <b>become</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> humans. In a 1984 paper, Tchernov suggested that the period in which the house sparrow and P.predomesticus could have separated was the Würm glaciation 70,000–10,000 years ago. Markus found that the fossil species was closest to living house sparrows from Palestine and to the great sparrow (P.motitensis), and proposed that the house sparrow evolved in Africa. In a 1977 account of the evolution of the house sparrow, American zoologists Richard F. Johnston and William J. Klitz considered that the house sparrow evolved with the beginning of agriculture, dating any fossils that could even be assigned to the common ancestor of the house and Spanish sparrows as more recent than P.predomesticus. In his 1988 work The Sparrows, British ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith considered that P.predomesticus was roughly contemporary with the common ancestor of the house and Spanish sparrows and that all present-day Palaearctic Passer species evolved later. Drawing on more recent studies of molecular data, Ted R. Anderson stated in his 2006 Biology of the Ubiquitous House Sparrow that all Passer species have a long evolutionary history, with speciation possibly occurring as early as the Miocene.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-20th century psychologists such as Hans Eysenck {{developed}} a personality profile {{for the typical}} smoker of that period; extraversion was associated with smoking, and smokers tended to be sociable, impulsive, risk taking, and excitement-seeking individuals. Although personality and social factors may make people likely to smoke, the actual habit {{is a function of}} operant conditioning. During the early stages, smoking provides pleasurable sensations (because of its action on the dopamine system) and thus serves as a source of positive reinforcement. After an individual has smoked for many years, the avoidance of withdrawal symptoms and negative reinforcement become the key motivations. Like all addictive substances, the amount of exposure required to <b>become</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> nicotine can vary from person to person.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{work has}} been {{published}} {{on the evolution of}} ant dulosis and almost all of it has at least some empirical evidence to defend its positions. Notably, that nearly all raiding ant species have is an adaptation of their mandibles that make them big or piercing or both. It makes sense that the very thing that enables an ant to be a better raider causes that same ant to <b>become</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> others; the parasite loses the use of its mandibles for actual work. On this and other evidence, it has been proposed that predation is the precursor to slavery. It has also been suggested that colony multiplication by adoption and budding followed by temporary parasitism can lead to dulosis. While observations indicate that colony multiplication can lead to temporary parasitism, it is apparently very questionable that temporary parasitism leads to dulosis.|$|E
