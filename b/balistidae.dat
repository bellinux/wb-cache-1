40|$|The {{triggerfishes}} (Family <b>Balistidae)</b> comprise approximately 40 {{species in}} 11 genera and {{are among the}} most conspicuous diurnal inhabitants of coral reef communities worldwide. Despite their ecological and commercial importance, relatively little is know of their interspecific relationships. Here we present a novel molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the Family <b>Balistidae</b> based on an analysis of two mitochondrial (12 S, 16 S) and three nuclear genes (4 C 4, Rhodopsin, RAG 1) sampled from 26 species. As part of our analysis, we implemented a recently developed reversible jump MCMC sampler that attempts to account for uncertainty in the underlying model of molecular substitution in Bayesian analysis. Clade posterior probabilities as well as parameter estimates thus reflect uncertainty in the choice of a substitution model. Comparison of model-averaged posterior probabilities with those from traditional MCMC reveals that model averaging had a negligible effect on clade posterior probabilities. The use of model averaging approaches in phylogenetics is an area of growing interest {{and this is the first}} study to test its effects on clade support values. Our phylogenetic results strongly support the monophyly of the family but suggest that the genera Balistoides and Pseudobalistes are paraphyletic with respect to other balistids. We also found strong support for Sufflamen as a sister group to the remaining <b>Balistidae.</b> We found Abalistes to be the sister group to a large clade including Melichthys, Xanthichthys, Balistes, and Canthidermis. Bayesian divergence time estimates under an uncorrelated rates model suggest that the MRCA of the crown group <b>Balistidae</b> appeared during the Late Oligocene (~ 25 MYA). The timing and pattern of diversification events suggests that the triggerfish radiation may have been influenced by the Mid-Miocene regionalization of marine invertebrate communities...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{reproduction}} of Rhinecanthus aculeatus (Linnaeus, 1758), a tropical Indo-Pacific reef fish, occurs aroundthe full and new moon (Kuwamura 1997). Spawningbegins 16 to 45 min before the sunrise. The courtshipsbegin 7 to 27 min before the spawning. A specific behaviourof the courtships {{is when the}} male places itsrostrum against the caudal peduncle of the female(Kuwamura 1997). Observations have been recorded in the lagoon ofTiahura [shallow sandy area (0. 5 - 2 m deep) withalgae Hypnea spinella (C. Agardh) Kützing, 1847 -Moorea, French Polynesia; 17 ° 29 ′ 27 ′ S, 149 ° 53 ′ 32 ″O]in March and April 2015. Fifteen R. aculeatus (fivemales and ten females) lived in this area where themales have territories, which included the subterritoriesof the females. During video-recorded courtships,in addition to the behaviour described byKuwamura (the nuzzling), two new behaviours havebeen observed: circling and touching. During the circling,the male and the female swim to the surface inprogressively larger circles (Fig. 1). The circling behaviourhas been observed in other <b>Balistidae</b> such asPseudobalistes flavimarginatus (Rüppell, 1829) andBalistapus undulatus (Park, 1797) (Lobel andJohannes 1980). During the touching, the abdomensof the male and the female’s touch each other withoutgametes emission (Fig. 2). The touching has been reportedfor Xanthichthys mento (Jordan and Gilbert 1882) (Kawase 2003). Although <b>Balistidae</b> present different reproductivestrategies, they have common reproduction features,such as {{the time and the}} day of hatching andspawning (Kawase 2003). Our observations are innovativebecause the courtship of R. aculeatus is morecomplicated than previously described. This resultsuggests, thus, that <b>Balistidae</b> have also some commoncourtship behaviour features. These behaviours mayfacilitate the release of gametes, as with the nuzzling(Kuwamura 1997) or can convince the partner to mate. We do not know if these patterns are phylogeneticallyrelated.

40|$|Abstract Background The order Tetraodontiformes {{consists}} of approximately 429 species of fishes in nine families. Members {{of the order}} exhibit striking morphological diversity and radiated into various habitats such as freshwater, brackish and coastal waters, open seas, and deep waters along continental shelves and slopes. Despite extensive studies based on both morphology and molecules, {{there has been no}} clear resolution except for monophyly of each family and sister-group relationships of Diodontidae + Tetraodontidae and <b>Balistidae</b> + Monacanthidae. To address phylogenetic questions of tetraodontiform fishes, we used whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences from 27 selected species (data for 11 species were newly determined during this study) that fully represent all families and subfamilies of Tetraodontiformes (except for Hollardinae of the Triacanthodidae). Partitioned maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analyses were performed on two data sets comprising concatenated nucleotide sequences from 13 protein-coding genes (all positions included; third codon positions converted into purine [R] and pyrimidine [Y]), 22 transfer RNA and two ribosomal RNA genes (total positions = 15, 084). Results The resultant tree topologies from the two data sets were congruent, with many internal branches showing high support values. The mitogenomic data strongly supported monophyly of all families and subfamilies (except the Tetraodontinae) and sister-group relationships of <b>Balistidae</b> + Monacanthidae and Tetraodontidae + Diodontidae, confirming the results of previous studies. However, we also found two unexpected basal splits into Tetraodontoidei (Triacanthidae + <b>Balistidae</b> + Monacanthidae + Tetraodontidae + Diodontidae + Molidae) and Triacanthodoidei (Ostraciidae + Triodontidae + Triacanthodidae). Conclusion This basal split into the two clades has never been reported and challenges previously proposed hypotheses based on both morphology and nuclear gene sequences. It is likely that the basal split had involved ecological diversification, because most members of Tetraodontoidei exclusively occur in shallow waters (freshwater, brackish and coastal waters, and open seas), while those of Triacanthodoidei occur mainly in relatively deep waters along continental shelves and slopes except for more derived ostraciids. This suggests that the basal split between the two clades led to subsequent radiation into the two different habitats. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Among {{the great}} marine fish diversity, the Order Tetraodontiformes is {{remarkable}} by presenting post-Perciformes modern features, representing {{one of the}} major branches of the teleosteans radiation. Patterns of chromosomal evolution in this group are not fully understood. In the present work, cytogenetical analyses were carried out in the species Balistes vetula (2 n= 44; FN= 44) and Melichthys niger (2 n= 40 and FN= 40) (<b>Balistidae),</b> Chilomycterus antennatus (2 n= 52; 6 M+ 46 st/a, FN= 58) (Diodontidae) and Sphoeroides testudineus (2 n= 46; 18 m+ 4 sm+ 6 st+ 18 a, FN= 74) (Tetraodontidae), collected along the Brazilian coast and Saint Pauls Rocks. All spe-cies presented Ag-NORs sites on a single chromosomal pair. Heterochromatic regions in this group are reduced and located at centromeric position over most of chromosomal pairs. The evolutionary patterns of chromosomal changes were diverse in the distinct Tetraodontiformes families. In <b>Balistidae,</b> the evolution process seems to be determined by in tandem or centric fusions, followed by pericentric inversions. The higher chromosomal number in Diodontidae indicates that centric fissions and pericentric inversions {{played an important role in}} the karyotypi-cal definition of this group. The Tetraodontidae S. testudineus displayed small chromosomes with a modal number shared with other species previously analyzed from this family.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the spawning activity using gonadosomatic index (GSI) and gonad histology the Balistes capriscus (Teleostei: <b>Balistidae)</b> of the Gulf of Gabès (Southern Tunisia, Central Mediterranean Sea). Methods: The reproductive biology of the species, based on 756 (480 females and 276 males), collected from commercial catches at several fishing ports including Chebba, Kerkennah and Zarzis at respective GPS coordinates (34 ° 14 ' N, 11 ° 06 ' E), (34 ° 45 ' N, 11 ° 17 ' E), (33 ° 41 ' N, 11 ° 48 ' E) was studied over 28 months (January 2008 -April 2010) using GSI and gonad histology. Sizes {{used in this}} study ranged from 11. 30 to 45. 60 cm in fork length. Results: Both GSI and gonad histology suggest that spawning activity occurred mainly between July and mid-September with a peak in July, coinciding with summer time. The first maturation occurred at 20. 26 cm fork length for females and 21. 30 cm fork length for males. The monthly values of hepatosomatic index and condition factor (K) indicated that the liver is the main organ responsible for the mobilization process of the energizing reserves during the sexual cycle.

40|$|The Tetraodontiformes are {{the most}} derived group of teleostean fish. Among other apomorphies, they are {{characterized}} by {{a high degree of}} fusions or significant bone loss in the head and body. In the early phylogenetic proposals presented for this order, the families <b>Balistidae</b> and Monacanthidae have been unanimously considered to be closely related. Although they have moderate species diversity, they are scarcely known in cytogenetic aspect and chromosomal pattern comparisons between these groups have yet to be established. The species Cantherhines macrocerus (Hollard, 1853), C. pullus (Ranzani, 1842) (Monacanthidae) and Melichthys niger (Bloch, 1786) (<b>Balistidae)</b> were cytogenetically analyzed using conventional (Ag-impregnation, C-banding, CMA 3 - and DAPI-fluorescence) and molecular (FISH with an 18 S rDNA probe) cytogenetic protocols. The karyotypes of all three species were very similar possessing diploid chromosome numbers 2 n = 40 and composed exclusively of acrocentric chromosomes. Single NOR-bearing pair as well as positive heterochromatic blocks at pericentromeric regions were identified in the karyotypes of the three species studied. NOR-bearing sites were positively labeled after Ag-impregnation, C-banding, CMA 3 -fluorescence and FISH with an 18 S rDNA probe but were negative after DAPI-fluorescence. Such remarkable shared conspicuous chromosomal characters corroborate either close phylogenetic relationship of these families, previously established by morphological and molecular data, or rather conservative nature of karyotype differentiation processes.

Larvae of reef-associated genera, especially the economically important subtropical and tropical members of the families Haemulidae (Haemulon), Lutjanidae (Lutjanus and Rltomboplites), Serranidae (Mycteroperca and Epinephelus), and Sparidae (Calamus and Pagrus) were targeted. Larvae representing 40 families were collected in neuston tows. Commonly collected reef-associated families were <b>Balistidae,</b> Blenniidae (dominated by the reef-associated Parablennius marmoreus), Mullidae, and Gobiidae. Larvae representing 70 families were collected in subsurface tows. Reef-associated families commonly collected included Apogonidae, <b>Balistidae,</b> Gobiidae, Haemulidae, LutJanidae, Scaridae, and Serranidae. Larval Haemulon sp (p)., Lutjanus sp(p)., and Rltomboplites aurorubens were commonly collected and thus {{it is likely that}} these taxa spawn in Onslow Bay and recruit to live-bottom sites within the area. Other families of fishes commonly collected but generally not considered reef-associated included Bothidae, Callionymidae, Carangidae, Clupeidae, Engraulidae, and Ophidiidae.

40|$|Abstract. —Although {{substantial}} uncertainty typically {{surrounds the}} choice of the best model in most phylogenetic analyses, little is known about how accommodating this uncertainty affects phylogenetic inference. Here we explore the influence of Bayesian model averaging on the phylogenetic inference of the triggerfishes (Family: <b>Balistidae),</b> a charismatic group of reef fishes. We focus on clade support as this area has received little attention and is typically {{one of the most important}} outcomes of phylogenetic studies. We present a novel phylogenetic hypothesis for the family <b>Balistidae</b> based on an analysis of two mitochondrial (12 S, 16 S) and three nuclear genes (TMO- 4 C 4, Rhodopsin, RAG 1) sampled from 26 ingroup species. Despite the presence of substantial model uncertainty in almost all partitions of our data, we found model-averaged topologies and clade posteriors to be nearly identical to those conditioned on a single model. Furthermore, statistical comparison of clade posteriors using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed no significant differences. Our results suggest that although current model-selection approaches are likely to lead to overparameterization of the substitution model, the consequences of conditioning on this overparameterized model are likely to be mild. Our phylogenetic results strongly support the monophyly of the triggerfishes but suggest that the genera Balistoides and Pseudobalistes are polyphyletic. Divergence time estimation supports a Miocene origin of the crown group. Despite the presence of several young species-rich subclades, statistical analysis of temporal diversification patterns reveals no significant increase in the rate of cladogenesis across geologic time intervals.
