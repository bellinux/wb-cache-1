40|$|An {{increasing}} number of Bos indicus-blood bulls are being used in crossbreeding programs for commercial beef production in the U. S., {{but there is little}} information available on pubertal development, sperm production and semen quality for young bulls of this type. Puberty in young Bos taurus bulls has been defined {{in a variety of ways}} (e. g., first ability to serve, first sperm production, first ejaculation of motile sperm, etc.), but all of these criteria are costly and labor-intensive to determine. We have shown previously (Lunstra et al., 1978) that, among young Bos taurus <b>beef</b> <b>bulls</b> of various breeds reared in the same environmental and management conditions, puberty occurs when a scrotal circumference of 28 cm is achieved, regardless of large differences in body wt and age at puberty among and within different breeds of bulls. In that study, puberty was defined as the age at which a bull first produced an ejaculate containing ≥ 50 million sperm with ≥ 10 % progressive motility. In addition, we (Lunstra and Echternkamp, 1982) and other researchers have shown that the major characteristics of semen quality improve linearly during the first 12 to 16 wk after reaching this criterion of puberty, and that these improvements in semen quality are highly correlated (r=. 44 to. 75) with the steady linear increase in scrotal circumference that occurs during this post-pubertal timeframe in Bos taurus <b>beef</b> <b>bulls.</b> Thus, scrotal circumference appears to be an accurate and easily-obtained measurement that provides a relatively reliable predictor of age at puberty in young Bos taurus <b>beef</b> <b>bulls.</b> However, similar studies on Bos indicus-blood bulls are needed before this relationship can be assessed or confirmed in zebu-blood bulls. It is not reasonable to attempt to use young bulls for natural mating or semen processing immediately after reaching this initial criterion of puberty (i. e., first ejaculate containing ≥ 50 million sperm with ≥ 10 % progressive motility). It does not become economically feasible to use young <b>beef</b> <b>bulls</b> for collection and processing of semen for artificial insemination until ejaculates containing ≥ 500 million sperm with ≥ 50 % progressive motility can be produced, and this is also a reasonable criterion for young bulls to reach before being used for natural mating. However, no studies using this more stringent semen criterion of puberty have been conducted in either Bos taurus or Bos indicus bulls. Because selection and use of superior sires at the youngest possible age is desired for natural mating and artificial insemination, further investigations of the relationships between postpubertal changes in testis size and aspects of semen quality are needed in young Bos taurus and Bos indicus <b>beef</b> <b>bulls.</b> The following study was conducted to determine the age at which young Bos taurus and Bos indicus crossbred <b>beef</b> <b>bulls</b> reach this revised criterion of puberty (i. e., first ejaculate containing ≥ 500 million sperm with ≥ 50 % progressive motility), and to evaluate interrelationships between pubertal age, testis size, and body wt in these specietypes of <b>beef</b> <b>bulls...</b>|$|R

40|$|The overall aims were {{to learn}} more about factors {{affecting}} fertility in Swedish beef sires in general and in yearling <b>beef</b> <b>bulls</b> in particular, focusing mainly on sexual maturity and hind limb health finding useful tools {{in order to be able}} to routinely perform a complete bull breeding soundness evaluations in Swedish <b>beef</b> <b>bulls.</b> Semen was collected from yearling <b>beef</b> <b>bulls,</b> postmortem, and the sperm morphology was evaluated. Using a strict definition, based on sperm morphology, we could demonstrate that less than half the number of the bulls was considered sexually mature at 12 months of age. Samples collected by transrectal massage were compared with the two most commonly used collection methods; artificial vagina and electroejaculation, and with samples collected by cauda epididymal dissection postmortem. Sperm morphology in semen collected by transrectal massage was as representative as in samples collected by artificial vagina and electroejaculation and to some extent also in those collected postmortem. However, reduction in volume, concentration and motility would need to be considered, especially if semen is collected outdoors under suboptimal conditions. In conclusion, the transrectal massage technique is a very useful semen collection method in the field when no other collection method is possible, thus enabling a complete bull breeding soundness evaluation. Femorotibial, femoropatellar (stifle), tarsocrural, talocalcaneus, and proximal intertarsal joints from young beef sires with impaired fertility, but no signs of lameness, were examined postmortem regarding the presence of joint lesions. A majority of the bulls had severe, bilateral lesions referred to as osteoarthritis secondary to osteochondrosis dissecans. We think that the osteoarthritis present in the hind limbs must have contributed to the infertility, rendering the bulls difficulties in mounting. The fact that most of the lesions were bilateral, could explain the absence of clinical lameness. The results of this study indicate that the poor fertility reported in these <b>beef</b> <b>bulls</b> can be a result of joint problems, secondary to osteochondrosis. Thus, joint lesions should always be taken into consideration as a contributory cause of reproductive failure in beef sires with or without symptoms of lameness...|$|R

40|$|Sperm {{chromatin}} {{status was}} assessed in 565 Zebu and Zebu crossbred <b>beef</b> <b>bulls</b> in extensive tropical environments using the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA). The SCSA involved exposure of sperm to acid hydrolysis for 0. 5 or 5. 0 minutes, followed by flow cytometry to ascertain relative amounts of double-stranded (normal) and single-stranded (denatured) DNA, {{which was used}} to generate a DNA fragmentation index (%DFI). With conventional SCSA (0. 5 -minute SCSA), 513 bulls (91 %) had 27 %DFI. In 5. 0 -minute SCSA, 432 bulls (76 %) had 27 %DFI. For most bulls, the SCSA was repeatable on two to four occasions; however, because most bulls had 27 %DFI categories. The %DFI was negatively correlated with several bull semen parameters and the strongest negative correlation was with normal sperm. There was a strong positive correlation between %DFI and sperm head abnormalities. Based on these findings, most Zebu <b>beef</b> <b>bulls</b> in extensive tropical environments had relatively stable sperm chromatin. Based on the apparent negative correlations with conventional semen parameters, we inferred that the SCSA measured a unique feature of sperm quality, which has also been suggested for other species.

Tests have been developed to measure a bulls mating ability or serving capacity. However, past studies investigating the relationship between serving capacity and herd fertility have been inconclusive with some researchers finding no relationship and other researchers reporting serving capacity tests to be an accurate predictor of bull fertility. Many of these studies differed in testing procedures and utilized bulls of different ages with varying levels of sexual experience; thus, differences in the findings may rest with these factors.

40|$|In {{this study}} profit {{equations}} for milk, veal and <b>beef</b> <b>bull</b> production {{were developed to}} obtain economic values for different traits.

For categorical traits, dystocia and carcass quality traits, economic values were derived using an underlying continuous scale. Parameters in the profit equations were chosen to reflect the Dutch situation for Black and White cows, but they can be changed to fit other breeds and production circumstances. The consequences of altering beef production characteristics on growth and mature weight in dairy cows are discussed in the paper but not included in the economic weights. Without product output restrictions, economic values for milk carrier, fat and protein yield were Dfl − 0. 082, 5. 70 and 12. 85 per kg, respectively. Under a multiple restriction of milk yield and fat content on herd level, economic weighhs were Dfl − 0. 328, 1. 04 and 12. 60 per kg, respectively. The economic weight of calf mortality was Dfl − 3. 83 per % and the marginal costs of dystocia were Dfl 59. 75 per cow per unit on the underlying liability scale. The economic value for birth weight was Dfl 5. 40 per kg for dairy farmers, Dfl − 4. 59 per kg for veal producers and Dfl − 6. 91 per kg for beef producers.

Mean Volume was 3. 2 ml (SD +/- 3. 7), mean duration of collection was 7. 4 min (SD +/- 2. 8), mean percentage progressively motile sperm was 43. 5 % (SD +/- 29. 2) and mean concentration was 201. 9 x 10 (6) spermatozoa/ml (SD +/- 278 x 10 (6)). Twenty-three of the 52 bulls were slaughtered 3 - 4 days after semen collection and aliquots of the cauda epididymal contents were collected for sperm morphology examination. The percentages of proximal droplets, abnormal tails and abnormal midpieces were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) and the percentage of detached heads was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) in the post-mortem samples compared with those in the TM samples. However, importantly there was no significant difference between the two sample types in the percentages of abnormal heads. This study demonstrates that semen can be collected from yearling <b>beef</b> <b>bulls</b> by TM. We think that TM constitutes a useful tool, when semen collection with EEJ or artificial vagina (AV) is not possible under field conditions, when included in the bull breeding soundness evaluation (BBSE) protocol. However, further studies are needed, and presently being carried out, to evaluate if semen samples collected by TM are comparable with semen samples collected by AV...|$|R
