25|$|The Bocuse Restaurant serves {{contemporary}} French food. It {{opened on}} May 5, 2012 after a $3 million renovation designed by Adam Tihany. Originally the Epicurian Room, and renamed the Escoffier Restaurant in 1974, the restaurant originally served classical French cuisine in an old-fashioned formal French dining room.

25|$|The {{wall of the}} mihrab {{is covered}} with 28 panels of white marble, carved and pierced, which have {{a wide variety of}} plant and {{geometric}} patterns including the stylized grape leaf, the flower and the shell. Behind the openwork hint, there is an oldest niche on which several assumptions were formulated. If one refers to the story of Al-Bakri, an Andalusian historian and geographer of the eleventh century, it is the mihrab which would be done by Uqba Ibn Nafi, the founder of Kairouan, whereas Lucien Golvin shares the view that it is not an old mihrab but hardly a begun construction which may serve to support marble panels and either goes back to work of Ziadet Allah I (817-838) or to those of Abul Ibrahim around the years 862-863. Above the marble cladding, the mihrab niche is crowned with a half dome-shaped vault made of manchineel <b>bentwood.</b> Covered with a thick coating completely painted, the concavity of the arch is decorated with intertwined scrolls enveloping stylized five-lobed vine leaves, three-lobed florets and sharp clusters, all in yellow on midnight blue background.|$|E

2500|$|The Haida {{also created}} [...] "notions of wealth", and Jenness credits {{them with the}} {{introduction}} of the totem pole (Haida: [...] ) and the <b>bentwood</b> box. Missionaries regarded the carved poles as graven images rather than intimate representations of the family histories that wove Haida society together. Chiefly families showed their histories by erecting totems outside their homes, or on house posts forming the building. [...] Their social organization was matrilineal. As the islands were Christianized, many cultural works such as totem posts were destroyed or taken to museums around the world. This significantly undermined Haida self-knowledge and further diminished morale.|$|E

He promoted her and sent her to the Crimpton-on-Sea camp {{to act as an}} overall controller of Yellowcoats during the 1959 season. She was an arrogant and selfish woman who used her association with Joe Maplin to gain promotion and authority. She immediately clashed with Gladys, whom she believed was bad at her job because of her lack of sports qualifications. She took away Gladys's authority and made Tracey <b>Bentwood</b> chief Yellowcoat and sports organiser, causing Gladys to resign. Gladys was saved by Ted, who knew Wainwright from years before when they performed together at [...] "The Palace" [...] at Attercliffe. Her real name was Beryl Green, and she was assistant to a magician called [...] "The Great Ming", with whom she had an affair and became pregnant. Ted threatened to reveal her past to Joe Maplin unless she resigned and left the camp.|$|E
