2500|$|When Orthodox Christians {{refer to}} Fallen Nature {{they are not}} saying that human nature has become evil in itself. Human nature is still formed {{in the image of}} God; we are still God's creation, and God has never created {{anything}} evil. But our fallen nature remains open to evil intents and actions. It is sometimes said that we are [...] "inclined to sin"; that is, we find some sinful things attractive. It is the nature of temptation to make sinful things seem the more attractive, and it is the fallen nature of humans that seeks or succumbs to the attraction. Orthodox Christians reject the Augustinian position that the descendants of Adam and Eve are actually guilty of the original sin of their ancestors. But just as any species begets its own kind, so fallen humans beget fallen humans, and from the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> existence we lie open to sinning by our own choice.|$|E

[...] "This vast work has the spirit of an epic, where the life of Russia of the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> century in general and in details has been recreated by the hand of a true master ... The manner in which Count Tolstoy conducts his treatise is innovative and original. This is the great work of a great writer, and in it there’s true, real Russia", Turgenev wrote. It was largely due to Turgenev's efforts that the novel started to gain popularity with the European readership. The first French edition of the War and Peace (1879) paved the way for the worldwide success of Leo Tolstoy and his works.|$|E
2500|$|Overwatchs {{diversity}} also {{extends to}} other character facets. Blizzard {{has said that}} some of the characters have LGBT identities; Metzen said that the inclusion of LGBT characters was not [...] "to be a data point or feel contrived in any way", but instead to have these identities [...] "play out organically". Tracer was the first identified as one of the LGBT characters via one of the promotional online comics. Blizzard said on this reveal [...] "as with any aspect of our characters' backgrounds, their sexuality is just one part of what makes our heroes who they are. From the very <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> work on Tracer's story, it just felt right to make this an aspect of her character."

2500|$|Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev had {{achieved}} closer relations during Reagan's second term, but Bush was initially skeptical of Soviet intentions. In 1989, {{just after the}} fall of the Berlin Wall, Bush met with Gorbachev in a conference on the Mediterranean island of Malta. The administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the Soviets, but not all initially found the Malta Summit to be a step in the right direction; Scowcroft, among others, was apprehensive about the meeting, saying that it might be [...] "premature" [...] due to concerns where, according to Condoleezza Rice, [...] "expectations [...] set that something was going to happen, where the Soviets might grandstand and force [...] into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the United States." [...] But European leaders, including François Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher, encouraged Bush to meet with Gorbachev, something that he did December 2 and 3, 1989. Though no agreements were signed, the meeting was viewed largely as being an important one; when asked about nuclear war, Gorbachev responded, [...] "I assured the President of the United States that the Soviet Union would never start a hot war against the United States of America. And we would like our relations to develop in such a way that they would open greater possibilities for cooperation.... This is just the beginning. We are just at the very <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> road, long road to a long-lasting, peaceful period." ...|$|E
2500|$|Through their {{interactions}} and their critiques of each other, Darcy and Elizabeth come to recognise their own faults {{and work to}} correct them. Elizabeth meditates on her own mistakes thoroughly in chapter 36: [...] "How despicably have I acted!" [...] she cried; [...] "I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust. How humiliating is this discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I {{could not have been}} more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself."Other characters rarely exhibit this depth of self-reflection—or, at least, are not given the space within the novel for this sort of development. Tanner notes that Mrs. Bennet in particular, [...] "has a very limited view of the requirements of that performance; lacking any introspective tendencies she is incapable of appreciating the feelings of others and is only aware of material objects." [...] Mrs. Bennet's behaviour reflects the society in which she lives, as she knows that her daughters will not succeed if they don't get married: [...] "The business of her life was to get her daughters married: it's solace was visiting and news." [...] This proves that Mrs. Bennet is only aware of [...] "material objects" [...] and not of her own feelings and emotions.|$|E
