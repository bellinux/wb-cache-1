30|$|Concerning the {{behavioural}} variables, {{the prediction}} that happy and unhappy groups would differ in participation in leisure activities was partly confirmed. We {{found that the}} happy people reported to engage more frequently in activities concerning family and home (such as visiting friends and relatives, shopping, going to the church, and watching TV), {{as well as in}} visiting various cultural events (i.e., going to theatre, art exhibition, concert, cinema, doing hobbies, and reading books) than do unhappy people. This result is in accordance with previous findings about positive relationships between leisure activities and subjective wellbeing (Brajša-Žganec et al. 2011; Newman et al. 2014). In the bottom-up theoretical model of Newman et al. (2014) authors argue that engaging in leisure could potentially promote various dimensions of subjective wellbeing in the leisure domain, which subsequently promotes global wellbeing. However, there is also a possibility of the reverse direction. The level of happiness may have an effect on leisure activities in the way that happy people {{would be more likely to}} involve in leisure activities than unhappy ones. However, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>design</b> of our study this assumption is only speculative. Interestingly, the differences between our two groups in engaging in activities of socializing and going out were not found significant, what is not in accordance with other research showing that socializing is an important component of happiness and that happy people socialize more than unhappy ones (Robinson and Martin 2008). One possible explanation of this result could be that some of the activities listed in the scale, such as going to café, are quite common activities in Croatia that almost everybody is involved in it, while other, such are dining in restaurants or playing and attending sport events are quite rare. Therefore, the frequency of involvement in these activities does not differentiate by level of happiness or preferences, but rather are part of daily living.|$|E
40|$|Cognitive {{theories}} of depression include maladaptive thinking styles as depressive vulnerabilities. The hopelessness theory of depression (Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy, 1989) particularly implicates stable and global attributions for negative events as influences upon depression. Positive event attributions are considered less influential, {{yet they have}} shown equal predictiveness to negative event attributions for depression-specific mood. Previous research has provided equivocal results largely <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>design</b> and modest {{psychometric properties of the}} measures. The present research aimed to: create a new instrument to measure optimistic and pessimistic attributions; test the relatedness of attributions for positive and negative events; and, clarify relationships of the scales with optimism and mood. Three studies were undertaken, all of which used structural equation modeling. Two cross-sectional studies, using 342 and 332 community participants respectively, developed and validated the Questionnaire of Explanatory Style (QES). A final longitudinal study with 250 community participants tested the predictive validity of the QES. Overall, six scales were developed, three of which were optimistic and three of which were negative. The scales were acceptable to community samples and had adequate psychometric properties. The optimistic scales were attributions for positive events and the negative scales were attributions for negative events rather than pessimistic scales. Cross-sectional results indicated that only one of the negative scales weakly directly predicted depression-specific mood, but all predicted general psychological distress. By contrast, the optimistic scales were more directly predictive of depression-specific mood, particularly the Positive Disposition scale. Longitudinal results indicated that two of the optimistic scales were the most important QES predictors of depression-specific mood two months later. The optimistic scale Positive Disposition appears most central to the prediction of both concurrent and subsequent depression-specific mood. The scale content represents explanations for positive events that are internal and stable characteristics. These may be construed as personal competencies to bring about positive outcomes. This scale is closely allied to measures of optimism. Findings affirm the importance of optimistic attributions to the understanding of depression-specific mood and provide a productive focus for therapeutic intervention and future research...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{results of}} studies {{measuring}} {{the number of}} endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in normal pregnancies and in preeclampsia have been highly controversial or even contradictory <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>designs</b> and different methodologies enumerating three distinct subsets of EPCs: circulating angiogenic cells (CAC), colony-forming unit endothelial cell (CFU-ECs), and endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs). To provide a clear explanation for these underlying controversies, we designed a prospective study to compare the number of all EPC subsets between three trimesters of normal gestation and a case–control study to compare these values as preeclampsia occurs with those from gestational age (GA) matched normal pregnancy. Methods: Samples from peripheral blood of nine women were taken during their three consecutive trimesters of normal pregnancy, and from eight women with preeclampsia. To cover most of the reported phenotypes for CACs and ECFCs in the literature, we enumerated 13 cell populations by quantitative flow cytometry using various combinations of the markers CD 34, CD 133, CD 309, and CD 45. We used routine culturing techniques to enumerate CFU-ECs. Results: The numbers of CACs and ECFCs were higher in women with preeclampsia (p =  0. 014). By contrast, preeclampsia {{was associated with a}} reduced number of CFU-ECs (p =  0. 039). The CAC number rose with the increase in GA (p =  0. 016) during normal pregnancy, while the number of CFU-ECs and ECFCs did not differ during the trimesters. Conclusion: Although we did demonstrate an increase in absolute counts of CACs and ECFCs in preeclampsia, fewer colony formation capacities indicated a loss in their functional capabilities. By contrast, the number of CACs increased without alterations in colony formation ability in normal pregnancy with the growth of the fetus. Here, by comparing different methodologies to calculate the number of EPC subsets, we could imitate the existing controversy in the literature for such calculations, which may help to elucidate clearer explanations...|$|R

METHODS: The study sample consisted of 3132 men and 4562 women of the French general working population in the southeast of France. Inclusion criterion was to have a work experience of at least 3 months. Cases of bullying were defined using both Leymann's definition and self-report of being exposed to bullying. Depressive symptoms were measured using the CES-D scale. RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates, which were age, marital status, presence of children, educational level, and occupation, exposure to bullying was found to be a risk factor for depressive symptoms for both men and women. The more frequent the exposure, the higher the risk of depressive symptoms. Past exposure to bullying increased the risk of depressive symptoms. Observing bullying was found to be a risk factor for depressive symptoms and increased the risk further still among women exposed to bullying. All these associations were found to be highly significant (P<. 001). CONCLUSION: Workplace bullying was found to be a strong risk factor for depressive symptoms for men and women. Although any conclusion about the causal nature of the association could not be drawn <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the survey, this study suggested that efforts to prevent bullying should be intensified...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Using {{samples from}} Italy and the U. S., {{we examine the}} {{mechanisms}} through which job insecurity affects task and contextual performance. Drawing on a two-dimensional stressor framework, it is hypothesized that job insecurity may affect behavioural outcomes differentially. On one hand, job insecurity may have a negative affect (hindrance stressor) and, on the other hand, it may positively affect behavioural outcomes (challenge stressor). The model attempts to disentangle both mechanisms by introducing overall job attitudes (job satisfaction and affective commitment) as mediating variables. The research permits us to examine cross-cultural generalizations. Methodology: Data were collected from 322 blue-collar workers in Italy and 320 staff in the U. S. The meditational model was tested using SEM with bootstrapping estimates of indirect effects. Results: In both countries, job insecurity {{is found to be}} a hindrance stressor that induces strain reactions: one way to cope with such a stressor is to behaviourally withdraw from the situation, i. e., reduced performance and OCB. Limitations: <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>design,</b> no inferences were made about true causal relationships. Practical Implications: Job insecurity does not act as a challenge stressor to motivate employees’ performance. This suggests that managers should communicate clearly about change initiatives to reduce job insecurity, enhance affective commitment and job satisfaction, thereby indirectly improving productive behaviours. Originality: This paper contributes to the cross-cultural generalizability of job insecurity and performance outcomes.

40|$|The {{decline of}} {{strength}} with age {{has often been}} attributed to declining muscle mass in older subjects. To investigate factors which might influence changes in strength across the life span, grip strength and muscle mass (as estimated by creatinine excretion and forearm circumference) were measured in 847 healthy volunteers, aged 20 — 100 years, from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study <b>of</b> Aging. <b>Cross-sectional</b> and longitudinal results concur that grip strength increases into the thirties and declines at an accelerating rate after age 40. However, the grip strength of 48 % of subjects less than 40 years old, 29 % of individuals 40 - 59 years old, and 15 % of subjects older than 60 did not decline during the average 9 -year follow-up. Grip strength is strongly correlated with muscle mass (r =. 60, p <. 0001). However, using multiple regression analysis, grip strength is more strongly correlated with age (partial r 2 =. 38) than muscle mass (partial r 2 =. 16). Additionally, a residuals analysis demonstrates that younger subjects are stronger and older subjects are weaker than one would predict based on their muscular size. Thus, while strength losses are partially explained by declining muscle mass, there remain other yet undetermined factors beyond declining muscle mass to {{explain some of the}} loss of strength seen with aging.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine associations of serum concentrations of POPs with self-reported history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). DESIGN: <b>Cross-sectional</b> associations <b>of</b> serum POPs concentrations with the prevalence of selfreported CVD were investigated in 889 adults ≥ 40 years of age in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999 – 2002. We selected 21 POPs [3 polychlorinated dibenzo-pdioxins (PCDDs), 3 polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), 5 dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 6 nondioxin-like PCBs, and 4 organochlorine (OC) pesticides] because they were detectable in ≥ 60 % of participants. RESULTS: Dioxin-like PCBs, nondioxin-like PCBs, and OC pesticides were positively associated with the prevalence of CVD only among females. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of serum concentration, the odds ratios for CVD across increasing quartiles were 0. 9, 2. 0, and 5. 0 for dioxin-like PCBs (p for trend < 0. 01), 1. 2, 1. 2, and 3. 8 for nondioxin-like PCBs (p for trend < 0. 01), and 1. 9, 1. 7, and 4. 0 for OC pesticides (p for trend = 0. 03). PCDDs showed positive trends with the prevalence of CVD in both males and females; adjusted odds ratios were 1. 4, 1. 7, and 1. 9 (p for trend = 0. 07, males and females combined).

30|$|The {{current study}} has some limitations. First, as {{mentioned}} above, causality {{could not be}} established <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>design.</b> Thus, future research should use a prospective design or test the effects of an intervention that ameliorates psychological inflexibility (e.g., based on ACT) to examine the relationships between psychological inflexibility and depressive and insomnia symptoms. Second, self-report cross-sectional data are subject to biases due to common method variance (CMV). However, the current study used many of the procedures suggested by Podsakoff et al. (2012) to control for common method biases, including protecting respondent anonymity, reducing evaluation apprehension, and using reliable and valid measures for each construct. Regardless, future research should use other methods (e.g., depressive symptom and sleep difficulty scores obtained from a psychiatric diagnosis, daily sleep diaries, and actigraphy, instead of self-report), {{as well as a}} longitudinal design to reduce potential CMV biases (see Podsakoff et al. 2012). Third, as the sample was comprised of only Japanese college students, generalizations to other samples should be made with caution. Our sample in the current study was a group of young adults (M =  17.75, SD =  8.95) who had nearly the same AAQ-II mean as another age group, which consisted of employees in the United Kingdom (M =  18.53, SD =  7.52, N =  583, Bond et al. 2011); a t test of the difference between the AAQ-II means in the current study and in Bond et al.’s study (2011) was not significant (t(1244) =  1.65, p =  0.099). However, further research with different ages may contribute to understanding the association between psychological inflexibility, depressive symptoms, and insomnia. In particular, it is important to determine the generalizability to clinical populations due to the use of symptom questionnaires and the potential transient nature of the symptoms. Moreover, the current study did not assess the participant’s health status, which is a potential confounding variable and an obvious shortcoming.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} therefore to test if there is a bidirectional relation between victimization and children’s symptoms of ODD in a large sample of 6 year olds (N= 790) who were followed up two years later. Children’s ODD symptoms were assessed by the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment interview (PAPA) when children were 6 and 8 years old respectively. Six items from the teacher reported questionnaire “The Revised Olweus Victimization Scale” measured victimization. The data were analysed using structural equation model in Mplus. The results showed that symptoms of ODD at age 6 predicted neither direct (e. g. “He/she was ignored by other children”) nor indirect (e. g. “He/she was ignored by other children”) victimization two years later. With regard to the opposite direction of influence, I found that victimization at age 6 predicted ODD symptoms at age 8, over and above children’s initial level of ODD symptoms. Subgroup analyses revealed that indirect victimization prospectively predicted ODD symptoms in boys, whereas this path was not significant for girls.

After adjusting for age, education, household income, marital status, insomnia, smoking and drinking status, participants with short sleep duration (< 6 h) had significantly higher body mass index (p = 0. 005), body fat mass (p = 0. 010), body fat percentage (p = 0. 021), waist circumference (p = 0. 029), as well as the odds ratio (OR) of risk of obesity [OR (95 % CI) = 1. 467 (1. 282 – 1. 678) ], compared to participants with optimal sleep duration (≥ 7 h).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a {{reduction}} in bone mass sufficient to {{increase the risk of}} fracture. Lead exposure during childhood may be a risk factor for low bone mineral density (BMD). Basic-science research demonstrates that lead exposure is associated with a decrease in BMD in animals. However, human studies are limited. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a secondary analysis of a national database to explore the association between lead exposure and osteoporosis in adult humans. METHODS: In this study we used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). We analyzed subjects who were ≥ 50 years of age. A concurrent venous blood lead level defined lead exposure. The primary outcome variable was the BMD of the total hip. We conducted analyses on four groups: non-Hispanic white men, non-Hispanic white women, African-American men, and African-American women. We conducted bivariate analyses between covariates known to be associated with bone density (i. e., age, body mass index, calcium intake, ethanol/tobacco consumption, physical activity, socioeconomic status) and the total hip BMD. The significant covariates were introduced into analysis of covariance to determine the association between BMD and blood lead level tercile. RESULTS: The adjusted mean total hip BMD among non-Hispanic white males with a blood lead level in the lowest tercile versus the highest tercile was 0. 961 g/cm 2 and 0. 934 g/cm 2, respectively (p < 0. 05). We also found a similar association among white females, but the difference was marginally significant (0. 05 < p < 0. 10). CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant inverse association between lead exposure and BMD, but only among white subjects. However, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> NHANES, we cannot make inferences about the temporal sequence of this association. With the large number of adults who had lead exposure in the past and the morbidity associated with osteoporosis, further inquiry is necessary on the possible casusal association between lead exposure and osteoporosis in humans...|$|R

With nominal regression analysis of data from a representative survey in 2010 among 935 Dutch mothers, we analyse various social influences on a mother’s current ideal family life. As hypothesized, {{the results show that}} a mother endorses a more egalitarian ideal family life if she recalls the gender role specific parental message ‘you should work in order to be financially independent of others’. Additionally, if the respondent recalls a positively work orientated mother at the age of 12 years, she has now as an adult more egalitarian ideals compared to daughters who recall a more home orientated mother or who have no memories of their mothers in that respect. We also show that as expected in the hypotheses 3 and 4, that Dutch mothers who have perceived career support by her partner and from people at work have now more egalitarian ideal family lives. Mothers’ current ideals are thus formed and further developed within prior social bonds. Moreover, mothers’ ideal family lives seem not only dependent on their current labour market behaviour, but to some degree resistant to change.

CAM encourages patients to {{play an active role}} in their healing process. The belief that a person’s own behavior influences health is assessed as the internal health locus of control (IHLOC). Studies on the association between IHLOC and CAM use yield inconsistent results. Using various indicators of CAM use, we evaluated whether there were differences in IHLOC between different groups of CAM users. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. IHLOC was compared between participants with high and low appraisal of CAM, between participants who used different types of medications (none, CAM, conventional, both), and who consulted with different health care professionals (none, CAM, conventional, both). Independent samples t-tests and ANOVAs were conducted for the total group and for subgroups of chronically ill and healthy participants. Post-hoc, we conducted a multivariate linear regression evaluating which indicators of CAM use or other characteristics showed the strongest association with IHLOC. Results A total of 1, 054 undergraduate students completed the survey. Participants with high CAM appraisal showed higher IHLOC than those with low CAM appraisal, regardless of whether they were chronically ill (p[*]<[*]. 001). Participants without chronic conditions showed higher IHLOC when only using CAM medications than when using either conventional medications alone or both conventional and CAM medications (p[*]<[*]. 05). All participants showed higher IHLOC when visiting only CAM practitioners than when visiting either only conventional or both conventional and CAM practitioners (p[*]<[*]. 05).

The association of vascular and renal conditions has been reported inconsistently. Unfolding the association may provide the insight to eye care providers to take account general health management into eye care. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of the vascular and renal comorbidities with AMD, examine the association of a single or combination of these comorbidities with AMD. DSIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-base cross-sectional study involved the adults aged 40 years or older (N= 4596) who participated in the 2005 to 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a national representative population-based survey of non-institutionalized US residents. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: AMD was defined by the presence of drusen and presence of pigmental abnormality. Angina pectoris (AP), coronary heart disease (CHD), congestive heart failure (CHF) and myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, assessed by self-report by the questionnaire of medical conditions, Chronic kidney disease (CKD), assessed by self-report and estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the level of urine albumin. Heart disease (HD) was defined as having AP or CHF or CHD or MI. RESULTS: Among individuals with AMD, 6 % had AP, 10 % had CHD, 7 % had CHF, 10 % had MI, 13 % had stroke, and 29 % had CKD. The weighted prevalence of these conditions were significantly higher than those without AMD (All P-values CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: These findings from the nationally-representative sample of the US population highlight the prevalence of vascular and renal comorbidities associated with AMD, the modest evidence of relationship of each single comorbidity, and strong association of combination of stroke and CKD to AMD independent of age, gender, and other factors. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>design,</b> the results <b>of</b> this study can not address a causal relationship between AMD and the examined comorbidities. It is unclear whether AMD and comorbidities arise from individual predisposition to vascular and renal diseases or whether complications from these morbidities increase the risk of AMD. However, the important caveat is that preventive and care management for the examined comorbidities may lessen the severity of symptoms or prevent AMD...|$|R

Both questionnaires included measures of development orientation, job development climate, affective commitment and intention to remain as well as individual characteristics and organizational characteristics. Findings The findings supported the proposed model in that development orientation was positively related to job development climate which, in turn, was positively related to affective commitment and affective commitment was positively related to intention to remain with the organization.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Knee {{buckling}} {{is common}} in persons with advanced knee osteoarthritis and after orthopedic procedures. Its prevalence in the community is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of knee buckling in the community, its associated risk factors, {{and its relation to}} functional limitation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, population-based study. SETTING: The Framingham Osteoarthritis Study. PARTICIPANTS: 2351 men and women age 36 to 94 years (median, 63. 5 years). MEASUREMENTS: Participants were asked whether they had experienced knee buckling or "giving way" and whether it led to falling. They were also asked about knee pain and limitations in function by using the Short Form- 12 and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, had isometric tests of quadriceps strength, and underwent weight-bearing radiography and magnetic resonance imaging of the knee. Radiographs were scored for osteoarthritis by using the Kellgren-Lawrence scale, and magnetic resonance images were read for anterior cruciate ligament tears. The relationship of buckling to functional limitation was examined by using logistic regression that adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and knee pain severity. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-eight participants (11. 8 %) experienced at least 1 episode of knee buckling within the past 3 months; of these persons, 217 (78. 1 %) experienced more than 1 episode and 35 (12. 6 %) fell during an episode. Buckling was independently associated with the presence of knee pain and with quadriceps weakness. Over half of those with buckling had no osteoarthritis on radiography. Persons with knee buckling had worse physical function than those without buckling, even after adjustment for severity of knee pain and weakness. For example, 46. 9 % of participants with buckling and 21. 7 % of those without buckling reported limitations in their work (adjusted odds ratio, 2. 0 [95 % CI, 1. 5 to 2. 7]). LIMITATION: Causal inferences are limited <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the study's <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>design.</b> CONCLUSION: In adults, knee buckling is common and is associated with functional loss...|$|R

40|$|High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes {{have been}} {{deployed}} {{as a tool for}} traffic management in urban freeway systems to improve reliability and mobility of trips. As they are planned to traverse crowded urban areas, {{it is often difficult to}} acquire sufficient right-of-way for retrofitting HOV lanes to existing freeway systems with recommended <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>design.</b> The present study proposes a methodology to determine the optimal set <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>design</b> for safety performance by evaluating individual impact of each design element on safety as well as tradeoffs between them. Detailed collision data of concurrent-flow buffer-separated HOV lanes along with their geometric features and traffic flow data were analyzed to estimate collision predictive models for HOV and the adjacent general purpose lanes by injury types. These models were used to determine the set <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>design</b> elements that minimizes the expected collision occurrences. As a case study, a real freeway corridor where converting continuous to buffer-separated types was underway was selected to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. This case study shows that the method can assist to determine cross-section design of HOV facilities for safety based on currently available geometric space. Engineering...|$|R

30|$|Several {{studies have}} {{examined}} learners` economic competencies in the vocational track in upper secondary education in German-speaking countries. Some of these studies used the German version of the TEL or parts of it (e.g., Beck and Krumm 1998; Lehmann and Seeber 2007). Furthermore, several studies investigated economic competencies in commercial apprenticeship programs (Klotz and Winther 2015; Seeber 2008; Winther 2010; Winther and Achtenhagen 2008) and revealed substantial differences among different programs. However, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the use <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>designs,</b> possible causes could not be identified. The main {{question is whether the}} program differences are affected mainly by program influences or by learners’ prerequisites. In general, one finding seems to be evident in most studies: when students complete more economic coursework, they score higher on related tests (for an overview, see Seeber et al. 2015).|$|R

30|$|The {{strength}} of the evidence is described as “convincing” (convincing evidence, Ce) if {{it is based on}} studies that show consistent associations and have longitudinal design with sufficient size and duration, whereas evidence of “probable” association (probable evidence, Pe) can be given to determinants showing fairly consistent associations based upon at least two cohort studies. In the second case, there are some shortcomings either in terms of the consistency of the results or other aspects such as limited duration of the studies, small sample sizes, or inadequate follow up. Furthermore, “limited suggestive evidence” (Ls) is given to determinants for which there is insufficient number of longitudinal studies and “limited, no conclusive evidence” (Lns) when the evidence for the associations between a determinant and the outcome are based solely on studies <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>design</b> [14].|$|R

40|$|Cross-sectional and {{longitudinal}} {{analyses of}} age-heterogeneous samples have revealed correlational links between and within intellectual, sensory, and sensorimotor domains. Due to basic limitations <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>designs</b> and {{a reluctance to}} disentangle antecedent-consequent relations in longitudinal designs, the functional significance and dynamics of these links have remained unclear. Advanced structural equation models allow representing multivariate longitudinal changes {{as a function of}} time-based and directed relations. We applied this methodology to longitudinal data from the Berlin Aging Study (at inception total {N} = 516; age range = 70 - 103 years) to explore the structural dynamics among perceptual speed, verbal knowledge, close visual acuity, and distance visual acuity. We found reliable, occasion-based, age-partialed latent regression paths that influence longitudinal changes within and across intellectual and sensory domains. We conclude that intellectual and sensory domains are dynamically linked in old and very old age, and discuss implications of this finding for theories of cognitive aging...|$|R
