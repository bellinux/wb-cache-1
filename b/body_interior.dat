2500|$|... 1988 saw the 35th Anniversary Edition of the Corvette. Each {{of these}} {{featured}} a special badge with an identification number mounted {{next to the}} gear selector, and were finished with a white exterior, wheels, and interior. In 1991, all Corvettes received updates to the <b>body,</b> <b>interior,</b> and wheels. The convex rear fascia that set the 1990 ZR-1 apart from the base model was now included on L98 Corvettes, making the styling of the expensive ZR-1 even closer {{to that of the}} base cars. The most obvious difference remaining between the base and ZR-1 models besides the wider rear wheels was the location of the CHMSL, which was integrated into the new rear fascia used on the base model, but remained {{at the top of the}} rear-hatch on the ZR-1's.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the specific packages above, all variants of the Vantage series are offered {{with a wide range}} of personalisation options, particularly in the interior where several different shades of leather – and even stitching – may be chosen to complement or contrast each other and the body (and, in the case of the convertible, the roof). The [...] "N400" [...] engine modifications and/or sports chassis are also available individually for those owners who would like to combine the increased power or handling of the special edition with the more subtle original <b>body,</b> <b>interior,</b> and badging – much like the [...] "POW" [...] Vantages of the 1980s. Many thousands of choices of colour, trim, and options combined with the in house [...] "customisation" [...] available through Works Service make it possible for a Vantage owner to configure a unique individual car to his or her specifications.|$|E

5000|$|Restorable; 30 to 39 points [...] This vehicle {{would be}} in need of {{restoration}} of the motor, <b>body,</b> <b>interior</b> and/or chassis. A car in this class should {{be more or less}} complete, needing some parts but requiring a tremendous amount of work to get to show quality.|$|E
50|$|Mercury's {{full-size}} offerings {{were completely}} revamped for 1961. <b>Bodies,</b> <b>interiors,</b> and chassis were {{basically the same}} as the big Ford's, although trim was different in order to distinguish the marques. The Montclair and Park Lane were discontinued and the Meteor was added {{at the bottom of the}} range, making Monterey once again the top of Mercury's lineup. The 292 cuin L Ford Y-block was standard, with 352 cuin L and 390 cuin L versions of the FE V8 available.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the time}} of its opening, Dunton was {{assigned}} responsibility within Ford of Europe for vehicle design, interior styling, chassis and <b>body</b> <b>interior</b> engineering, engine calibration and product planning. Ford's Merkenich Centre in Cologne, Germany was given principal responsibility for body and electrical engineering, base engine design, advanced engine development, exterior styling, homologation, vehicle development (ride, handling, NVH) and transmission engineering. This was a 'systems' approach to the engineering process intended to eliminate the duplication of engineering responsibility within Ford of Europe.|$|E
50|$|Another {{solution}} for items {{that have not}} been restrained is the loadspace barrier net. These may be directly attached to the body structure or, in vehicles with loadspace cover cassettes, as a combined loadspace cover and barrier net. The net confining luggage to the loadspace in case of emergency braking and minor traffic collisions. These nets have the advantage over metal guards that they can be rolled-up when not in use, taking up much less space than a comparable guard. A guard may however be tailored for an even tighter fit to the <b>body</b> <b>interior</b> contours than a roll-away net.|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} from fragmentation experiments at elevated external pressure; {{the application of}} overpressure to a small target allows the experiment to match the lithospheric compressive stress of a larger <b>body's</b> <b>interior.</b> With increasing overpressure, the fragmentation undergoes a transition, from a material strength-dominated regime to one that is dominated by applied overpressure, analogous to the transition from strength to gravity effects. High pressure testing allows direct measurement of the energy/unit target mass requirement of catastrophic fragmentation due to compressive stresses...|$|R

50|$|Manufactured in {{accordance}} with the Transportation Accessibility Law, the 2000 series has from its beginning had wheelchair spaces and over-door LED information displays to indicate on which side the doors will open with multi-lingual support. 8000 series rolling stock was remodeled to include these features also. The intercom and emergency stop button were also moved close to the wheelchair space and their height adjusted to be usable from a wheelchair. Car <b>body</b> <b>interior</b> space was enlarged (by removing the baggage areas found in the 8000 series), and the elevation difference between platform and entry/exit doors reduced.|$|E
5000|$|Although not as {{deliberate}} a downsizing as {{what was}} to come to future Ford cars, the 1977 Thunderbird was far smaller than its predecessor, shedding nearly 10 in of length and 900 lb of weight; height and width remained essentially unchanged. The 1977 Thunderbird was created on the existing intermediate car platform by recycling a select mix of <b>body,</b> <b>interior</b> and trim parts from the previous year's Ford Elite, Mercury Montego and Mercury Cougar combined with some all new <b>body,</b> <b>interior</b> and trim parts to create a dramatic new Thunderbird look. The Thunderbird was distinguished from the LTD II and Cougar 2-door models by its unique wrap-over [...] "basket handle" [...] roofline with opera windows and large rear side quarter windows separated from the rear window by thin C-pillars. Headlamps hidden with retractable covers and full-width dropped center taillamps made a comeback from the late 1960s. As such being based on the intermediate Ford platform, a wider range of powertrains were now available. The base engine was the 302 cuin L Windsor V8, while the larger 351 cuin L 351M and 400 cuin L and T-tops were available as options along with the 351W. In California, the 351 was the only engine available. Although the smaller engines had lower output than the 460 V8, the lighter weight did compensate towards overall performance; the 400 was dropped in 1979 with the introduction of CAFE requirements.|$|E
50|$|A. modesta has poor {{eyesight}} and {{in order}} to breed, individuals probably locate each other by smell and touch. Having found a partner, they push against each other and probe each other with their oral tentacles. They then each extend their penis, which is armed with a sharp stylet, and push this through the body wall of the partner and transfer sperm by hypodermic injection. The gonad occupies most of the <b>body</b> <b>interior,</b> and the injection can be anywhere on the body wall. Reciprocal injections usually take place at the same time, especially in larger individuals. These sea slugs are able to transfer sperm in this way within two days of metamorphosis when only 0.5 mm long.|$|E
25|$|Black bear fat {{was once}} valued as a {{cosmetic}} article that promoted hair growth and gloss. The fat most favoured {{for this purpose}} was the hard white fat found in the <b>body's</b> <b>interior.</b> As {{only a small portion}} of this fat could be harvested for this purpose, the oil was often mixed with large quantities of hog lard. However, animal rights activism over the last decade has slowed the harvest of these animals; therefore the lard from black bears has not been used in recent years for the purpose of cosmetics.|$|R
40|$|William Forsythe’s recent {{investigations}} of the sonic potentials of dance movement have led him to generate improvisational modalities that extend dancing into the <b>body’s</b> <b>interior</b> by means of translations between movement and vocalization.

The [...] "Mutual Core" [...] app features a video game in which the player arranges geological layers in the same way as an accordion to play chords. During the verses, the player tries to unite the hemispheres, because the energy keeps them apart while during the chorus the app shifts to a cutaway of a planet, and the player can touch the layers of the planets interior to open it up and touch the core. The player may also change the resistance of the chords to increase the difficulty. [...] "Crystalline" [...] features a video game in which the player, in the form of a crystal, travels through different tunnels, depending on where the player tilts their device, with each tunnel corresponding to a part of the song. The player may decide to repeat the same part of the song endless times if he goes through the same tunnel.

40|$|This {{paper is}} related to other {{previous}} investigations carried out {{by one of the}} authors, on internal body image and on how anatomical knowledge is acquired during childhood and early adolescence (Amann Gainotti, 1988; Nenci, Di Prospero, Amann Gainotti, 1989). Those studies allowed the description of an approximate sequence of stages through which the internal body image is progressively build up. This process involves a steady increase of the representation of internal organs and genitalia or sex-related organs such as the penis,the uterus,the ovaries. During adulthood,contrary to previous periods,metaphorical/symbolical images of the <b>body</b> <b>interior</b> appear, and when an anatomical drawing is made,a schematic very simplified and partial image is the result. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyze the graphical behavior with relation to <b>body</b> <b>interior</b> in a group of adults, students of SSIS-Lazio (section Human Sciences). The group consisted of 30 students,divided into 14 males and 16 females. 80 % of the subjects have a degree in Philosophy,some of them have a degree in either Psychology or History,or a teachers'college training. Results show that the drawings are divided into two main categories :A) Anatomical type drawings N= 10 / 30 B) Metaphorical/symbolic drawings N= 20 / 30 Almost all males made <b>body</b> <b>interior</b> drawings of type B (13 / 14), while more females (9 / 16) interpreted <b>body</b> <b>interior</b> from an anatomical point of view. Very few subjects (3 females) depicted sexual parts. These results,that seem to undervalue the body and sexuality could be related to the cultural background (Philosophy) of the subjects...|$|E
