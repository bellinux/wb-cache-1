5|$|Ben Youssef Mosque, {{distinguished}} by its green tiled roof and minaret, {{is located in}} the medina and is Marrakesh's oldest mosque. It was originally built in the 12th century by the Almoravid Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf in honor of Yusuf ibn Ali al-Sanhaji. When built it was the city's largest mosque <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>it</b> is half its original size. It was rebuilt in the 1560s by Saadian Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib, as the original had fallen into ruin. He also built a madrasa with a large library beside the mosque, but this also deteriorated over time, leaving only the 19th-century mosque intact. The Almoravid Koubba Ba’adiyn, a two-storied kiosk, was discovered in a sunken location on the mosque site in 1948. In the Moroccan architectural style, its arches are scalloped on the first floor, while those on the second floor bear a twin horseshoe shape embellished with a turban motif. The dome of the kiosk is framed by a battlement decorated with arches and seven-pointed stars. The interior of the octagonally arched dome is decorated with distinctive carvings bordered by a Kufic frieze inscribed with the name of its patron, Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf. The quinches at the corners of the dome are covered with muqarnas. The kiosk has motifs of pine cones, palms and acanthus leaves which are also replicated in the Ben Youssef Madrasa.|$|E

The Casa Monica Hotel was purchased in 1997, renovated to its original grandeur, and re-opened in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Easter (påsk) {{is celebrated}} in Sweden. The belief in witches {{travelling}} to Blåkulla on Maundy Thursday (originally for a Sabbath with the Devil) is honoured by children dressing up as witches (påskkärring), {{knocking on the}} doors in the neighbourhood requesting treats (much like trick or treating during Halloween).

25|$|Another {{concern is}} that about {{one third of the}} world's soil-bound carbon is in taiga and tundra areas. When the {{permafrost}} melts, it releases carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and methane, both of which are greenhouse gases. The effect has been observed in Alaska. In the 1970s the tundra was a carbon sink, <b>but</b> <b>today,</b> <b>it</b> is a carbon source. Methane is produced when vegetation decays in lakes and wetlands.|$|E

Many of the stores selling jewelry, arts and other fine merchandise have been converted into stores with more mass-produced items and souvenirs. Another change occurred in the vicinity of Amberes Street, where bars, clubs and other businesses catering to the gay community have appeared. These are distinguished by the use of rainbow colors on their facades.|$|E
25|$|In the past, UVA was {{considered}} not harmful or less harmful than UVB, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>it</b> {{is known to}} contribute to skin cancer via indirect DNA damage (free radicals such as reactive oxygen species). UVA can generate highly reactive chemical intermediates, such as hydroxyl and oxygen radicals, which in turn can damage DNA. The DNA damage caused indirectly to skin by UVA consists mostly of single-strand breaks in DNA, while {{the damage caused by}} UVB includes direct formation of thymine dimers or other pyrimidine dimers and double-strand DNA breakage. UVA is immunosuppressive for the entire body (accounting for {{a large part of the}} immunosuppressive effects of sunlight exposure), and is mutagenic for basal cell keratinocytes in skin.|$|E
