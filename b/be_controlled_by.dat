5|$|A {{secondary}} rhetorical battle began between Walpole and the Irish {{in regard}} to Wood's patent; {{the rest of the}} constitutional debate was over the nature of Poynings' Law, a law that was brought back into use through the Declaratory Act (1720). Poyning's Law was a law that the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and to revoke the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> Poyning's Law. The Drapier agreed with the Irish interpretation of the law and incorporated aspects of Molyneux's arguments that combined proof the law was misinterpreted and Locke's political philosophy.|$|E

They may be intelligent or preprogrammed, but they must not <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> a remote human operator. Computational power need not be carried on the air vehicle itself. Computers operating from standard commercial power may be set up outside the competition arena boundary and uni- or bi-directional data may be transmitted to/from the vehicles in the arena. Size or weight constraints are normally placed on the aerial robots, which must be equipped with a method of manually activated remote override of the primary propulsion system.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Apogee, Jackson {{entered into}} {{a joint venture with}} Clair Brothers to design a digital {{loudspeaker}} controller for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson estimated that the project would cost $800,000 in U.S. dollars, but it ended up costing Clair Brothers more than $2M. From the same garage in which he started Apogee, Jackson developed the proprietary Clair iO: a two-input, six-output digital audio matrix with opto-isolated output circuits. An essential element of the system was its ability to <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> wireless tablet computer by an audio engineer walking around to various seating sections in a concert venue, to tailor the system's response more precisely.|$|E
5|$|Although this species' {{population}} {{now appears}} to be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers, this petrel is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern. The perceived decline may be due increased predation from gulls, skuas and introduced mammals. Eradication of rats protects seabird colonies and may enable recolonisation of islands cleared of rodents. Predation of cave-nesting petrels in the Balearics by yellow-legged gulls is restricted to relatively few individual gulls specialising in this prey item; this means that the problems can <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> selective culling and the provision of plastic nest boxes.|$|E

5|$|In Greek folklore, a stikhio (στοιχείο) was {{a spirit}} that {{protected}} his territory against the adverse stikhio spirits from other territories. In Albanian tradition, a dragoi was a dragon-man with enormous {{strength and the}} power to fly; he was born with a caul. He saved his region from a kuçedra or kulshedra, a female serpentine demon. In Romanian folklore, there were no defenders against bad weather, which was produced by a gigantic flying serpentine creature called a balaur or a zmeu. A balaur could <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> an evil sorcerer called a şolomonar, who was able to ride on that demon. The notion of a şolomonar named a vîlva, who protected his village against attacks of vîlvas from other villages, was marginally encountered in some places of Romanian Banat.|$|E
5|$|Miles {{subsequently}} {{supported the}} Empress, and in 1146, Ranulf, the Earl of Chester and temporarily {{on the side}} of the king, attacked and took the town of Bedford, but was unable to take the castle, which continued to <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> Miles until his death several years later. Towards the end of the war, Bedford Castle may have been attacked again; Henry II, during the final year of the conflict in 1153, marched through Bedford and documentary evidence shows damage to the town at this time. Historians are divided as to whether the castle was besieged at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{designed}} {{a new type}} balloon vessel based on Carlotta's discoveries of aerodynamics and how airship bodies acted in the sky. Carlotta {{was the first woman}} to use a maneuverable airship. She used a cloth screw-sail and also a cloth rudder for controlling the steering of her aeroplane platform. The platform car device weighted 11 pounds. This {{was the first time that}} an ordinary spherical balloon could <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> a person. Myers then incorporated new features into balloons based on Carlotta's findings. For a more efficient steerable airship vessel he made his next balloon gas bag bottom flat so that it would act like an inclined plane.|$|E

5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra.|$|E
