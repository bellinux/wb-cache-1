40|$|Since 2006, the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV) calculates a daily {{version of}} the Broad Consumer Price Index (IPCA), the {{official}} inflation index, calculated under {{the responsibility of the}} IBGE, the federal statistics agency in Brazil. Ardeo et. al. (2013) showed the importance of this indicator and how this daily information can be useful to a country that had high level of inflation. Despite the fact that this measure is a fair antecedent variable for inflation, due to some peculiarities concerning the collection period, the initial daily rating may not anticipate some effects, such as seasonal factors and the increase in prices controlled by the Brazilian Government.

Different from earlier heuristics in the very late reduce stage or after seeing all the data, we address the skew from the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> input, and make no assumption about a priori knowledge of the data distribution nor require synchronized operations. We examine the input in a continuous fashion and adaptively assign tasks with a load-balanced strategy. We show that the optimal strategy is a constrained version of online minimum makespan and, in the MapReduce context where pairs with identical keys must be scheduled to the same machine, there is an online algorithm with a provable 2 -competitive ratio. We further suggest a sample-based enhancement, which, probabilistically, achieves a 3 / 2 -competitive ratio with a bounded error. Department of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|E
