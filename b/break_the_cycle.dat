25|$|Sanitation is the {{prevention}} of human contact with feces and the proper treatment and disposal of wastewater. Sanitation also includes promoting hygiene {{on a personal level}} through washing hands with soap. Proper sanitation protects people from hazards that may be microbiological, biological or chemical agents of disease. The main objective of a sanitation system is to protect and promote human health by providing a clean environment that will <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> of disease. For example, improving access to safe sanitation and changing hygiene behaviours can reduce the incidents of diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|Rebirth, or saṃsāra, is {{the concept}} that all life forms go through a cycle of reincarnation, that {{is a series of}} births and rebirths. The rebirths and {{consequent}} life may be in different realm, condition or form. The karma theories suggest that the realm, condition and form depends on {{the quality and quantity of}} karma. In schools that believe in rebirth, every living being's soul transmigrates (recycles) after death, carrying the seeds of Karmic impulses from life just completed, into another life and lifetime of karmas. This cycle continues indefinitely, except for those who consciously break this cycle by reaching moksa. Those who <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> reach the realm of gods, those who don't continue in the cycle.|$|E

25|$|Bloomberg {{has placed}} a strong {{emphasis}} on public health and welfare, adopting many liberal policies. As the mayor he made HIV, diabetes, and hypertension all top priorities. He extended the city's smoking ban to all commercial establishments and implemented a trans fat ban in restaurants. Bloomberg has been a strong supporter of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation– the largest urban healthcare agency in the United States– serving over 1.3 million New Yorkers, and has touted its use of information technology and Electronic Health Records to increase efficiency and enhance patient care. He launched a program called Opportunity NYC which is the nation's first-ever conditional cash transfer pilot program designed to help New Yorkers <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> of poverty in the city. He instituted a $7.5 billion municipal affordable housing plan, the largest in the nation, that is supposed to provide 500,000 New Yorkers with housing.|$|E
25|$|If {{the water}} {{in direct contact with}} the {{pressure}} transfer mechanism (diaphragm or piston and the spring balancing the internal pressure) of the regulator freezes, the mechanism will be locked in the position at which the freezing takes place, as the ice will prevent the movement required to close. Since the cooling takes place during flow through the regulator, it is common for the freezing to occur when the first stage valve is open, and this will freeze the valve open, allowing a continuous flow through the first stage. This will cause the inter-stage pressure to rise until the second stage opens to relieve the excess pressure, the pressure relief valve on the first stage opens, or a low pressure hose or fitting bursts. All of these effects will allow the flow through the first stage to continue, so the cooling will continue, and this will keep the ice causing the problem frozen. To <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> it is necessary to stop the gas flow or expose the ice to a heat source capable of melting it. While underwater, it is unlikely to find a heat source to thaw the ice and stopping the flow is only option. Clearly the flow will stop when the pressure in the cylinder drops to ambient, but this is undesirable as it means total loss of the breathing gas. The other option is to close the cylinder valve, shutting off the pressure at the source. Once this is done, the ice will normally melt as heat from the surrounding water is absorbed by the slightly colder ice, and once the ice has melted, the regulator will function again.|$|E
500|$|In the one {{thousand}} {{years that followed}} Sin's creation {{and the destruction of}} Zanarkand, Spira became a rustic land, almost completely devoid of large cities and higher civilization. [...] Due to the actions of Sin, and the Yevon ban on machina, few territories reached larger than hamlet size, as they were destroyed by Sin and their populations decimated before they were able to develop. [...] The only cities left larger than small villages were Luca, which houses the only blitzball stadium in Spira, and Bevelle, the center of the temples of Yevon.

500|$|In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison {{credits the}} {{influence}} for his song [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] to A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder {{and leader of}} the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement. Harrison adds that the song specifically espouses the message that [...] "we are not these bodies, we are in these material bodies in the physical world." [...] His friend Ravi Shankar once observed that Harrison exhibited tyagi, a trait meaning non-attachment or renunciation, a point to which Shankar added: [...] "He had everything – all the wealth, the fame, whatever he wanted. But he was not attached to it... because he was searching for something much higher, much deeper. It does seem like he already had some Indian background in him [...]" [...] Harrison later said of life in the material world, referring to the need to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> of rebirth associated with reincarnation: [...] "The whole point to being here, really, is to figure a way to get out." ...|$|E
500|$|Marjorie Gilberg, {{executive}} director of the anti-teenage violence group <b>Break</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cycle,</b> commented that [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] can teach listeners about the dangers of abusive relationships if interpreted correctly. She believed that because popular culture often depicts what is socially acceptable, people may accept such violence more easily. She added, [...] "One problem, though,... is that the song reflects myths about domestic violence—myths that lead to blaming the victim." [...] Gilberg said the victim is often accused of being as guilty as the partner but wants to be loved, not abused. Terry O'Neill, a feminist {{and the president of the}} National Organization for Women, criticized the lyric, [...] "But your temper's just as bad as mine is / You're the same as me", saying it is a typical excuse used by abusive men for aggression and that [...] "it's only 2-year-olds and violent men who use violence to get what they want." [...] She added that Rihanna unintentionally glorifies domestic violence in the song despite attempting to fight it.|$|E

[...] On Zhakul, Amon's role in the Ulan prophecy is further elaborated on, and it is here that he is first referred to as the [...] "fallen one."

500|$|The Kikuuiki album {{sessions}} {{were influenced by}} the commercial success of [...] "Aruku Around", where the band considered what sorts of songs they wanted to make, {{and what sort of}} music they should present to their new audience for the audience to understand what songs Sakanaction create other than [...] "Aruku Around"-style ones. The band did not want to make an album full of songs identical to [...] "Aruku Around", and instead wanted to express to their listeners the breadth of musical inspirations that they could mix together. Yamaguchi felt {{that it was important to}} not release a second similar song immediately after [...] "Aruku Around", as he saw that music consumers in the 2010s were acting as critics on their own Mixi or Twitter accounts. For these people, he believed it was important to exhibit different aspects of the band. He felt this was important for growing Sakanaction as a band, to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> of a musical act becoming popular, then continuing to release the same style of music that made them popular until people grew tired of them. Even before the single's success, the band planned to feature songs on the album that would go against listeners expectations of what Sakanaction was as a band. On the other hand, the band attempted to keep a commercial sound, the same goal of Shin-shiro, or else they felt that their efforts would have been wasted. This led the band trying to create pop art music, blending art with commercialism.|$|E
