40|$|Many bis-intercalating dyes {{used for}} {{fluorescence}} detection of DNA in electrophoresis {{have been reported}} to give <b>band-splitting</b> and band-broadening, which results in poor resolution and a decreased detection sensitivity. We have studied the dimeric dye YOYO- 1, and to some extent also TOTO- 1 and EthD- 1, and found that in complex with DNA these dyes give rise to two components with different electrophoretic mobilities. Electrophoresis experiments and spectroscopic measurements on the two components show that they differ in that the DNA molecules have different amounts of dye bound. Our results exclude that the extra bands are caused by intermolecular cross-linking. Incubation of the samples for increasing times before electrophoresis makes the bands move closer and closer to each other as the dye molecules become more homogeneously distributed among the DNA molecules. Finally, the two bands merge into one at an intermediate position. This equilibration process is extremely slow at room temperature (days), and is therefore not a practical method to eliminate <b>band-splitting</b> in routine analysis.

The heights of the EUV waves associated with the events were determined in relation to the wave fronts. The heights of the shocks were estimated by applying two different density models to the frequencies of the Type-II emissions and compared with the heights of the EUV waves. For the 13 June 2010 event, with <b>band-splitting,</b> the shock speed was estimated from the frequency drifts of the upper and lower branches of the harmonic lane, taking into account the H/F frequency ratio fH/fF = 2. Exponential fits on the intensity maxima of the branches revealed to be more consistent with the morphology of the spectrum of this event. For the 6 June 2012 event, with no <b>band-splitting</b> and with a clear fundamental lane on the spectrum, the shock speed was estimated directly from the frequency drift of the fundamental emission, determined by linear fit on the intensity maxima of the lane. For each event, the most appropriate density model was adopted to estimate the physical parameters of the radio source. The 13 June 2010 event presented a shock speed of 664 - 719 km/s, consistent with the average speed of the EUV wave fronts of 609 km/s. The 6 June 2012 event was related to a shock of speed of 211 - 461 km/s, also consistent with the average speed of the EUV wave fronts of 418 km/s.

40|$|The {{uprising}} of {{efficient and}} low-cost digital signal processors (DSP's) {{lead to the}} development of noise canceling systems with a high performance. The conventional noise cancelers use a Fir transversal filter adapted by the LMS algorithm (ANC) (Windrow, Sterns, 1985). The ANC is quite simple to implement but has important limitations which reduce its efficiency, namely the low convergence rate and the crosstalk between the two input signals, noise and speech. New adaptive structures are presented in this work which purpose is to increase the speed of convergence of the adaptive algorithm. In this method the input signals are <b>band-splitting</b> in sub-bands. Following this frequency <b>band-splitting,</b> a conventional ANC is used for each sub-band. Faster convergence is obtained due the reducing of the spectral dynamic range in each sub-band. A new class of crosstalk resistant structures, referred as MBME (Multi-Banda Mestre-Escrava), are proposed hereafter. The key aspects of the MBME are: low computational costs, high robustness in terms of algorithm stability, fastness of convergence and low speech distortion, allowing to get a high improvement in signal-to-noise ratio at the output. The new structures have been evaluated through the theoretical and experimental results, being the later obtained by real time implementation, on a DSP, of the noise cancelers. The experimental results from the comparison of the MBME and the CTRANC structures (Crosstalk Resistant Adaptive Noise cancelers) (Zinser et al., 1985) have shown that the proposed structures do present, in relation to the CTRANC, several advantages such as: a better robustness in terms of stability of the adaptive algorithm, fastness of convergence and a lower residual error as well as lower computational costs than the CTRANCAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Context. The {{origin of}} coronal type-II radio bursts {{and of their}} <b>band-splitting</b> are still not fully understood. Aims. To make {{progress}} in solving this problem {{on the basis of}} one extremely well observed solar eruptive event. Methods. The relative dynamics of multi-thermal eruptive plasmas, observed in detail by the SDO/AIA and of the harmonic type-II burst sources, observed by the NRH at ten frequencies from 445 to 151 MHz, is studied for the partially behind the limb event on 3 November 2010. Special attention is given to the <b>band-splitting</b> of the burst. Analysis is supplemented by investigation of coronal hard X-ray (HXR) sources observed by the RHESSI. Results. It is found that the flare impulsive phase was accompanied by the formation of a double coronal HXR source, whose upper part coincided with the hot (T~ 10 MK) eruptive plasma blob. The leading edge (LE) of the eruptive plasmas (T~ 1 - 2 MK) moved upward from the flare region with the speed of v= 900 - 1400 km/s. The type II burst source initially appeared just above the LE apex and moved with the same speed and in the same direction. After about 20 s it started to move about twice faster, but still in the same direction. At any given moment the low frequency component (LFC) source of the splitted type-II burst was situated above the high frequency component (HFC) source, which in turn was situated above the LE. It is also found that at a given frequency the HFC source was located slightly closer to the photosphere than the LFC source. Conclusions. The shock wave, which could be responsible for the observed type-II radio burst, was initially driven by the multi-temperature eruptive plasmas, but later transformed to a freely propagating blast shock wave. The most preferable interpretation of the type-II burst splitting is that its LFC was emitted from the upstream region of the shock, whereas the HFC - from the downstream region.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to conventional superconducting (SC) materials, superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors (HTCs) usually emerges {{in the presence}} of other fluctuating orders with similar or higher energy scales, thus instigating debates over their relevance for the SC pairing mechanism. In iron-based superconductors (IBSCs), local orbital fluctuations have been proposed to be directly responsible for the structural phase transition and closely related to the observed giant magnetic anisotropy and electronic nematicity. However, whether superconductivity can emerge from, or even coexist with orbital fluctuations, remains unclear. Here we report the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) observation of the lifting of symmetry-protected band degeneracy, and consequently the breakdown of local tetragonal symmetry in the SC state of Li(Fe 1 -xCox) As.

Self affinity in the chaotic region imprints scaling features to the crossover distributions along the sequence of band splitting points. The trajectories that give rise to these distributions are governed first by the sequential formation of phase-space gaps when, initially uniformly-distributed, sets of trajectories evolve towards the chaotic band attractors. Subsequently, the summation of positions of trajectories already within the chaotic bands closes those gaps. The possible shapes of the resultant distributions depend crucially on the disposal of sets of early positions in the sums and the stoppage of the number of terms retained in them...|$|E

However, the {{biological}} nature of hierarchically organized splitting of chromosomal bands of human chromosomes is an enigma and has not been, as yet, studied. Results Here we present {{for the first time}} the hierarchically organized splitting of chromosomal bands in their sub-bands for all human chromosomes. To do this, array-proved multicolor banding (aMCB) probe-sets for all human chromosomes were applied to normal metaphase spreads of three different G-band levels. We confirmed for all chromosomes to be a general principle that only Giemsa-dark bands split into dark and light sub-bands, as we demonstrated previously by chromosome stretching. Thus, the biological band splitting is in > 50 % of the sub-bands different than implemented by the ISCN nomenclature suggesting also a splitting of G-light bands.

40|$|We {{analytically}} {{calculate the}} intrinsic spin-Hall conductivity (ISHC) (σ^z_xy and σ^z_yx) in a clean, two-dimensional system with generic k-linear spin-orbit interaction. The coefficients {{of the product}} of the momentum and spin components form a spin-orbit matrix β. We find that the determinant of the spin-orbit matrix describes the effective coupling of the spin s_z and orbital motion L_z. The decoupling of spin and orbital motion results in a sign change of the ISHC and the band-overlapping phenomenon. Furthermore, we show that the ISHC is in general unsymmetrical (σ^z_xy≠-σ^z_yx), and it is governed by the asymmetric response function, which is the difference in <b>band-splitting</b> along two directions: those of the applied electric field and the spin-Hall current. The obtained non-vanishing asymmetric response function also implies that the ISHC can be larger than e/ 8 π, but has an upper bound value of e/ 4 π. We will that the unsymmetrical properties of the ISHC can also be deduced from the manifestation of the Berry curvature at the nearly degenerate area. On the other hand, by investigating the equilibrium spin current, we find that determines the field strength of the SU(2) non-Abelian gauge field. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the origin of}} anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in ferromagnetic transition metals, we study the intrinsic AHE based on a multi-orbital (xz,yz) -tight-binding model. We find that a large anomalous velocity comes from the off-diagonal (inter-orbital) hopping. By this reason, the present model shows a large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) which is compatible with typical experimental values in ferromagnets [100 - 1000 [1 /Ω cm]], without necessity to assume a special band structure at the Fermi level. In good metals where resistivity ρ is small, the intrinsic AHC is constant (dissipation-less) as found by Karplus and Luttinger. In bad metals, however, {{we find that the}} AHC is proportional to ρ^- 2 when ħ/ 2 τ is larger than the minimum <b>band-splitting</b> measured from the Fermi level. This crossover behavior of the intrinsic AHE, which was first derived in J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 63 (1994) 2627, is recently observed in various ferromagnetic metals universally by A. Asamitsu et al.

40|$|As a {{counterpart}} to our previous {{study of the}} stationary distribution formed by sums of positions at the Feigenbaum point via the period-doubling cascade in the logistic map (Eur. Phys. J. B 87 32, (2014)), we determine the family of related distributions for the accompanying cascade of chaotic <b>band-splitting</b> points in the same system. By doing this we rationalize how the interplay of regular and chaotic dynamics gives rise to either multiscale or gaussian limit distributions. As demonstrated before (J. Stat. Mech. P 01001 (2010)), sums of trajectory positions associated with the chaotic-band attractors of the logistic map lead only to a gaussian limit distribution, but, as we show here, {{the features of the}} stationary multiscale distribution at the Feigenbaum point can be observed in the distributions obtained from finite sums with sufficiently small number of terms. The multiscale features are acquired from the repellor preimage structure that dominates the dynamics toward the chaotic attractors. When the number of chaotic bands increases this hierarchical structure with multiscale and discrete scale-invariant properties develops. Also, we suggest that the occurrence of truncated q-gaussian-shaped distributions for specially prescribed sums are t-Student distributions premonitory of the gaussian limit distribution.

These {{are responsible for the}} intimate connection between high and low-energy scale physics, and their key role in the mechanism of HTSC was conjectured very early on. More recently, the detection of quantum oscillations in high-magnetic field experiments on YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 +x (YBCO) has suggested the existence of a Fermi surface of well-defined quasiparticles in underdoped cuprates, lending support to the alternative proposal that HTSC might emerge from a Fermi liquid across the whole cuprate phase diagram. Discriminating between these orthogonal scenarios hinges on the quantitative determination of the elusive quasiparticle weight Z, over a wide range of hole-doping p. By means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on in situ doped YBCO, and following the evolution of bilayer <b>band-splitting,</b> we show that the overdoped metal electronic structure (0. 25 <p< 0. 37) is in remarkable agreement with density functional theory and the Z= 2 p/(p+ 1) mean-field prediction.

While the shock ahead of the CME has been observed {{for a long time in}} the in situ data, it has been identified recently near the Sun in the coronagraphic and EUV images. Unlike in situ observations, the imaging observations are two dimensional, so one can better discern the CME-shock relationship near the Sun.

The method involves measuring the standoff distance, the radius of curvature of the flux rope, and assuming the value of the adiabatic index and deriving the Alfvenic Mach number. The next step is to derive the Alfvenic Mach number from the measured shock speed and an estimate of the local solar wind speed.
