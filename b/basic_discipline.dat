40|$|C-Consultants. On {{behalf of}} the {{academic}} subgroup I would like to review the contributions of recent cognitive studies to knowledge management. Cognition and cognitive theories Let me start out my review by defining the concept of cognition. Cognition of a humanbeing is his or her internal. mental process that begins with the reception of information and terminates with action taking. It is possible to see a cognitive process in an organization or communities of people, although the process includes a communicative, interactive process. Cognitive process consists of various mental processes of using knowledge. 1) Information gathering: People and organizations are not passive receivers of information, but they actively engage in searching valuable information based on their knowledge. 2) Sense-making. After acquiring relevant information, they {{make sense of the}} information by combining it with their existing knowledge. 3) Choice: Based on the sense making, people derive alternative courses of action using their knowledge. They compare the results of alternatives and choose alternative that satisfies their goals, using their knowledge. 4) Commitment: People and organizations commit themselves to the chosen course of action. Cognitive process is the process of using knowledge and driven by knowledge. There is another aspect of cognitive process: it is the process of creating, acquiring, enhancing, mixing, and discarding knowledge, or the learning process. Management and cognitive theories: three <b>basic</b> <b>disciplines</b> Management is a field that applies the theories of <b>basic</b> <b>disciplines.</b> Human and organizational cognition have been studied in various <b>basic</b> <b>disciplines.</b> and discarding.

50|$|Tetlock has {{a long-standing}} {{interest}} in the tensions between political and politicized psychology. He argues that most political psychologists tacitly assume that, relative to political science, psychology is the more <b>basic</b> <b>discipline</b> in their hybrid field. In this view, political actors—be they voters or national leaders—are human beings whose behavior {{should be subject to}} fundamental psychological laws that cut across cultures and historical periods. Although he too occasionally adopts this reductionist view of political psychology in his work, he has also raised the contrarian possibility in numerous articles and chapters that reductionism sometimes runs in reverse—and that psychological research is often driven by ideological agenda (of which the psychologists often seem to be only partly conscious). Tetlock has advanced variants of this argument in articles on the links between cognitive styles and ideology (the fine line between rigid and principled) {{as well as on the}} challenges of assessing value-charged concepts like symbolic racism and unconscious bias (is it possible to be a “Bayesian bigot”?). Tetlock has also co-authored papers on the value of ideological diversity in psychological and social science research. One consequence of the lack of ideological diversity in high-stakes, soft-science fields is frequent failures of what Tetlock calls turnabout tests.|$|E

With the Silurian of the Tarim basin as an example, based on the reconstruction of the evolution history of the four factors (paleo-anticline, source rock, regional cap rock and kinematic equilibrium belt) controlling hydrocarbon accumulation, this model was adopted to predict favorable hydrocarbon accumulation areas and favorable exploration regions following structural destruction in three stages of oil filling, to provide guidance for further exploration of oil and gas in the Silurian of the Tarim basin.|$|E
