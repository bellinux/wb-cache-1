Its walls had been hung with Willesden scrim gilded over; the {{curtains}} were silver-grey; there was a divan covered with silver-and-gold stuff, and a beaten brass fireplace. It was a study in silver, and gold, save for two touches of fantasy--a screen round the piano-head, covered with brilliantly painted peacocks' tails, and a <b>blue</b> <b>Persian</b> vase, in which were flowers of various hues of red.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stephen, I'm intolerably wretched. No {{creature}} {{has ever}} been gladder {{to have been born}} than I was for the first five and twenty years of my life. I was full of hope and I was full, I suppose, of vanity and rash confidence. I thought I was walking on solid earth with my head reaching up to the clouds, and that sea and sky and all mankind were mine for the smiling. And I am nothing and worse than nothing, I am the ineffectual mother of two children, a daughter whom I adore--but of her I may not tell you--and a son,--a son who is too like his father for any fury of worship, a stolid little creature.... That is all I have done in the world, a mere blink of maternity, and my <b>blue</b> <b>Persian</b> who is scarcely two years old, has already had nine kittens. My husband and I have never forgiven each other the indefinable wrong of not pleasing each other; that embitters more and more; to take it out of each other is our rôle; I have done my duty to the great new line of Justin by giving it the heir it needed, and now a polite and silent separation has fallen between us. We hardly speak except in company. I have not been so much married, Stephen, I find, as collected, and since our tragic misadventure--but there were beautiful moments, Stephen, unforgettable glimpses of beauty in that--thank God, I say impenitently for that--the door of the expensively splendid cabinet that contains me, when it is not locked, is very discreetly--watched. I have no men friends, no social force, no freedom to take my line. My husband is my official obstacle. We barb the limitations of life for one another. A little while ago he sought to chasten me--to rouse me rather--through jealousy, and made me aware indirectly but a little defiantly of a young person of artistic gifts in whose dramatic career he was pretending a conspicuous interest. I was jealous and roused, but scarcely in the way he desired. 'This,' I said quite cheerfully, 'means freedom for me, Justin,'--and the young woman vanished from the visible universe with an incredible celerity. I hope she was properly paid off and not simply made away with by a minion, but I become more and more aware of my ignorance of a great financier's methods as I become more and more aware of them....|$|E

5000|$|... 1994: Bohemia Rex/Czech Curly Cat. Although not {{recognised}} until 1994, this longhair rex of Persian conformation {{has existed}} in Liberec, The Czech Republic since 1981. It arose when curly kittens {{were born in}} a pedigree Persian litters. The parents were traced back to two <b>blue</b> <b>Persian</b> males imported from Germany in the 1970s. These males may have inherited a spontaneous mutation or may have carried the German Rex mutation due to Persian cats {{being used in the}} German Rex breeding program and some of the straight-coated offspring being registered as Persians. Test-matings found that only some Bohemia Rexes have the Cornish (German) Rex mutation and that there is an unknown second rexing gene involved. There was little interest in this variety until after the recognition of the Selkirk Rex Longhair.|$|E
50|$|Registries {{allocate}} a breed number, acronym or a Code to the breeds they register. Most use {{a two or}} 3 letter acronym e.g. MK (Munchkin), JBT (Japanese Bobtail). This may {{be followed}} by numbers or lower case acronyms that indicate colour and pattern, these being subdivisions of the breed. For historical reasons, the British GCCF allocate numbers to breeds and the Black Persian Longhair is registered under a different breed number, and effectively as a different breed, to the <b>Blue</b> <b>Persian</b> Longhair. These lists may be found on individual registry websites (or in their printed publications where they {{do not yet have}} a website).

The foundation of the breed in postwar France were offspring of this pair. They had to be heavily outcrossed with long-hair breeds such as Persian and Siamese to rebuild the Birman breed. By the early 1950s, pure Birman litters were once again being produced. The restored breed was recognized in Britain in 1965 and by the CFA in 1966 The first Birman cats were seal point. The blue point colour was introduced in 1959 using <b>blue</b> <b>Persian</b> lines. New colours were later added by English breeders including chocolate, red, and tabby/lynx points.

50|$|Inside the train, {{the cars}} were lavishly furnished. Each car was clad in circassian walnut with a gold inlay pattern. The headliners were cream colored. Window shades were made of blue Spanish pantasote. The luggage racks were nickel-plated. Each car had a {{drinking}} fountain by the North Pole Sanitary Drinking Fountain company of Chicago. Collapsible cone-shaped paper cups with the train's logo were available via a dispenser above the fountain. Coaches were fitted out with 64 individual seats which rotated, nickel-plated coat hooks, and umbrella holders mounted {{to the back of}} the seats. Upholstery was <b>Persian</b> <b>Blue,</b> rendered in figured mohair. The seats were triple-cushioned, 48 rattan lounge chairs in silver and blue lined either side of the observation car. These were upholstered in <b>Persian</b> <b>blue</b> Avalon plush, with a gold-tinted floral pattern. The coaches and combines had a men's lavatory and toilet located at one end of the car on opposite sides of the aisle. The coaches and observation car were fitted out with a generous women's lounge with an adjoining toilet. The lounge had a full-length mirror, two wicker arm chairs, a boudoir chair, and a cup and towel vendor. The floor covering was a <b>Persian</b> <b>blue</b> carpet with a gold modern pattern. The combines had 48 blue leather bucket seats. The flooring was a blue-and-cream diagonal checkerboard linoleum tile. This same flooring was utilized in the vestibules and lavatories as well as the observation platform. The dining car could accommodate 36 patrons. Porters in blue uniforms served savory dishes and homemade goodies. The tables were set with the finest embroidered blue tablecloths with the train's logo, special china and flatware, and a silver base lamp with parchment shade. The lampshades had an astral pattern of comets and stars, and tinted lightbulbs were employed to cast a soft blue glow. Apparently the fresh apple pie with a slice of sharp cheddar cheese was a popular offering. Each train consisted of a baggage car, combine-smoker, coaches, and an observation car. The diner accompanied the early morning trip to Atlantic City and the evening return to Jersey City.|$|R

50|$|In general, the decors tend {{to imitate}} those of Chinese porcelain, with the {{production}} of blue and white pieces with Chinese form and motifs (curved marly, chi clouds, dragons etc.) In any case, the <b>Persian</b> <b>blue</b> is distinguished from the Chinese blue by its more numerous and subtle nuances. Often, quatrains by Persian poets, sometimes related to the destination of the piece (allusion to wine for a goblet, for example) occur in the scroll patterns. One can also notice a completely different type of decor, much more rare, which carries iconography very specific to Islam (Islamic zodiac, bud scales, arabesques) and seems influenced by the Ottoman world, as is evidenced by feather-edged anthemions (honeysuckle ornaments) widely used in Turkey.|$|R
