5|$|German {{armoured}} forces advanced north {{over the}} Dordrecht bridge to IJsselmonde island. Three tanks, two PzKpfw. IIs and a Panzerkampfwagen III {{of the staff}} platoon of the 1st Tank Battalion, stormed the Barendrecht bridge into the Hoekse Waard, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them were lost to a single 47mm antitank-gun. Though the Germans did not follow up their attack, this area too was abandoned by the Dutch troops.|$|E

5|$|Aalborg Airport, officially {{opened in}} 1938 {{because of the}} success of the cement industry, had in fact {{operated}} flights to Copenhagen since 1936. During the German invasion of Denmark in 1940, the airport was captured by German paratroopers on the night of the 21 April as a base for German aircraft flying to Norway. On 13 August 1940, a dozen Bristol Blenheim bombers of No. 82 Squadron RAF were launched against the Luftwaffe airfield during one of the most disastrous Royal Air Force raids of the war. One turned back because of fuel problems, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the remaining 11 were shot down by enemy fighters and/or flak batteries within 20 minutes. After the war, the Royal Air Force destroyed all the German facilities including planes, hangars and equipment but left the passenger facilities intact.|$|E
5|$|Barkley won the August 6 {{election}} {{by a vote}} of 294,391 to 223,149, carrying 74 of Kentucky's 120 counties, with large majorities in western Kentucky, the city of Louisville, and rural areas. It was the first loss of Chandler's political career, and the worst suffered by a primary candidate in Kentucky's history to that time. Barkley defeated his Republican opponent, Louisville Judge John P. Haswell, securing 62% of the general election vote. Encouraged by Barkley's success, Roosevelt campaigned against conservative Democratic incumbents in southern states, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these candidates won, which damaged Roosevelt's image.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle {{was located}} {{on one of}} the main frontiers of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. From 1434 until its {{annexation}} by the Russian Empire in 1793, the castle {{played a major role in}} the defense against the oncoming Cossack, Ottoman and Tatar invasions; from the 15th through 17th centuries, the castle was attacked by Tatar hordes a total of 51 times. The Tatar invasions of 1448, 1451, 1509 and 1528, as well as the Ottoman siege of 1533, caused damage to both the castle and the city <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these invasions were successfully repelled.|$|E

Khoo only had two professional diplomas – a Diploma in Administrative Management and a Certified Diploma in Accounting and Finance from ACCA. He finally received an unconditional offer from the University of Stirling after he impressed the visiting Director of the MBA programme showing how he managed the award-winning shopping mall. In 1989, accompanied by his wife, he left Malaysia to pursue his MBA studies in Scotland and graduated with Distinction in 1991. Instead of returning to Malaysia, he went to Singapore again to seek better opportunities there and was offered the job as Director of Operations for Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC).|$|E
5|$|Hiryū began {{recovering}} her Midway strike {{force at}} around 09:00 and finished shortly by 09:10. The landed aircraft were quickly struck below, while the carriers' crews began preparations to spot aircraft for the strike against the American carrier forces. The preparations were interrupted at 09:18, {{when the first}} attacking American carrier aircraft were sighted. These consisted of 15 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers of VT-8, led by Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron from the Hornet. They attempted a torpedo attack on Soryū, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the American planes were shot down by the 18 CAP fighters, leaving one surviving aviator treading water.|$|E
5|$|In 1977-78, the West Australian Government, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Charles Court, announced plans for a nuclear power reactor near Perth. 1977 was seen as the year of mass mobilization in WA, with 300 at the first anti-nuclear demonstration to 9,000 at the third protest in the inner city of Perth. Despite public protest, the WA Government selected a first site for a nuclear reactor in 1979 at Wilbinga, 70 kilometres north of Perth. Court predicted that at least another 20 nuclear power plants would be needed {{by the end of the}} century to meet rapidly growing power demand, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> this never eventuated.|$|E

5|$|Overall {{planning}} for Bodyguard and Ironside rested with John Bevan and the London Controlling Section (LCS). The LCS {{had been set}} up in 1942 following successes in deception in the Middle East by Dudley Clarke. After initial attempts at deception planning the department was tasked with bringing Bodyguard to fruition. One of their most useful deception channels was through double agents. During {{the early stages of the}} war, the Abwehr (German intelligence) had sent spies to Britain, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them either surrendered or were captured. Some, along with other volunteers, were used as an extensive misinformation network under the control of the Twenty Committee.|$|E
5|$|Secretary Stanton ordered McClellan {{to report}} to Trenton, New Jersey, for further orders, {{although}} none were issued. As the war progressed, there were various calls to return McClellan to an important command, following the Union defeats at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, as Robert E. Lee moved north {{at the start of}} the Gettysburg Campaign, and as Jubal Early threatened Washington in 1864. When Ulysses S. Grant became general-in-chief, he discussed returning McClellan to an unspecified position. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these opportunities were impossible, given the opposition within the administration and the knowledge that McClellan posed a potential political threat. McClellan worked for months on a lengthy report describing his two major campaigns and his successes in organizing the Army, replying to his critics and justifying his actions by accusing the administration of undercutting him and denying him necessary reinforcements. The War Department was reluctant to publish his report because, just after completing it in October 1863, McClellan openly declared his entrance to the political stage as a Democrat.|$|E
5|$|She was {{modified}} at Chatham Dockyard {{for use as}} a target ship between 6 December 1920 and 8 April 1921. The ship was rewired for radio control and stripped; the 12-inch turrets remained aboard, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> her guns and their equipment were removed, as were her torpedo equipment, flying deck, sea cabins, main derrick and boat equipment, lower conning tower, masts and yards, most of her crew amenities, and other unnecessary equipment. Unnecessary hatches, coamings, scuttles, and lifts were removed and plated over, and she was ballasted differently than she had been as a battleship. It was not intended to sink her, so she was assigned a crew of 153 to maintain and operate her when she was not under fire.|$|E

To avoid feeling lonely on Valentine's Day, she {{schedules}} her {{surgery for}} that day, but soon realizes she will need someone to escort her home from the dentist's office due to the aftereffects of anesthesia. She asks her colleagues at the 30 Rock building for a ride home, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them have Valentine's Day plans and cannot help. When Liz calls the dentist's office to say {{she does not have}} anyone to pick her up, the receptionist (Shinnerrie Jackson) informs her that after her procedure she can only leave alone if she signs a liability waiver. Liz initially intends to sign the document, but is dissuaded at a party by musician Jon Bon Jovi, and instead decides to claim to the receptionist that she has a ride home after all.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} Chola coins {{discovered}} {{so far are}} not as many as those of Pandyas; {{most of them have}} been found from archeological excavations at Puhar and Arikamedu, and also beds of rivers Amaravathi near Karur and South Pennar near Tirukkoilur. An early Chola coin has also been found in Thailand. The Chola coins do not contain a portrait or a legend and all of them depict symbols of animals and other inanimate objects like the animal series of the Cheras. <b>But,</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them carry the symbol of a tiger, the Chola emblem, on their reverse. One of the coins has been assigned a date earlier than 200 BCE and some others to about the time of Roman influence, which is around the dawn of the Christian era.|$|E

However, only a few aircraft landed before {{the next wave of}} Japanese strike aircraft arrived and began their attacks on Enterprise, forcing a suspension of landing operations.|$|E

At home, SpongeBob is drying his hair and receives a phone call, he puts the hair dryer in his square pants, and the dryer inflates them, giving him the ability to fly. He goes around helping people, earning their admiration and becoming a superhero of sorts. However, other characters continue to ask increasingly unnecessary favors of him, leaving him no time to fly with the jellyfish.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics; while several {{felt that the}} music was good and keeping in tone with the game, others {{found it to be}} odd and shallow. Several reviewers attributed the change to the lack of participation by Uematsu. Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission Original Soundtrack and Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection, on the other hand, were very well received by critics, who felt that they were far superior to the original soundtrack. The singles for the soundtrack were poorly received by critics, who found a few of the songs to be enjoyable <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the singles to be overpriced.|$|E
5|$|Clarke was {{a critic}} of migrant labour schemes, which were {{designed}} to attract foreign labour to Rhodesia, and in 1900 he defended the rights of indigenous labour against infringement by foreign Africans from Mozambique, Nyasaland, Zambia and South Africa. As early as 1900, the BSAC came to the Colonial Office with a proposal regarding Chinese labour. In London, the Land and Mine Owners Association was formed in 1902 to lobby the Colonial Office and continued to press throughout 1903. The Colonial Office postponed its decision saying that the question concerned not only Rhodesia <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> southern Africa. Milner was lobbied by the BSAC and he promised his support. Clarke, however, dismissed the demands, arguing that 'the introduction {{of large numbers of}} Asiatics... will subject the aboriginal natives to unfair competition'. He forecast that the labour shortage was temporary and that the new bureau would satisfy demand. Clarke also argued that most Rhodesians were opposed to the introduction of Chinese labour. The Duke of Marlborough, then Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, recorded that he found Clarke's argument more convincing than Milner's, and the Colonial Office refused the proposal.|$|E
