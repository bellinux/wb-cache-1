The {{second half of the}} recital, encompassing three sections, contains nationalistic folk inspired literature. The opening selections are two Cleopatra arias from George Frederic Handel???s Giulio Cesare. In the aria ???Venere bella,??? Act II, scene vii, Cleopatra prays gaily to the goddess Venus requesting an alluring disguise to capture a royal heart, Giulio Cesare. However in her aria ???Piangero la sorte mia,??? Act III, scene iii, Cleopatra???s mood drastically changes. After being captured by her brother, she grievingly mourns her entrapment, political failure, and possible death. Both arias are in da capo form, containing arioso passages, florid and sustained melodies, which enhance Cleopatra???s diverse emotional expressiveness. Following the Handel are John Harbison???s Mirabai songs. The cycle is based and translated from selected poetry of Mirabai, a 16 th century Indian princess. Mirabai???s poems are about her obsessive religious love for Krishna, ???The Dark One. ???

Mosaic two colour broad-band CCD imaging extending to 10 Mpc at the mean redshift of the survey have been taken at LCO; comprising over 50 Gb of raw data. A reduction pipeline is developed for these data and catalogues are constructed for these clusters. Four of these fields are compared to the APM catalogue (Maddox et al. 1990) to confirm their photometric accuracy. In making the comparison several populations of galaxies are discovered to be absent from the APM. A statistical background correction technique is developed to examine the photometric properties of cluster members. Eleven clusters are combined together to investigate environmental trends in the stellar populations of the combined sample. It is found that the modal colours of galaxies lying on the colour-magnitude relation in the clusters become <b>bluer</b> by <b>d</b> (B - R) /dr(_p) = - 0. 022 ± 0. 004 with radius or d (B - R) /dlog(_ 10) (Σ) = - 0. 076 ± 0. 009 with local galaxy density. The 2 dF spectroscope at the A AT is used to make spectroscopic follow-up observations of three clusters. A reduction pipeline for these data is developed and redshifts for the galaxies are determined. The spectral catalogues are used to define cluster membership and confirm the photometric environmental trends.

The robot may use either all or none of the stations for reloading. These cases {{are said to be}} preemptive resp. non [...] preemptive. We will generalize these concepts by restricting the nodes {{that can be used for}} reloading. According to the previous versions we will call this variation semi [...] preemptive. We will distinguish between an exogenous and an endogenous case. Problems of the first type will allow the robot to use only a subset of stations that can be used as reload nodes. The latter case consists of a number k and it will be part of the problem to decide at which stations the robot reloads, but no more than k times. We will show that both the exogenous and the endogenous problem are efficiently solvable by dynamic programming on paths and circles. Both variants are NP [...] complete on trees. For the exogenous case we will give an approximation algorithm with ratio 4 / 3. The endogenous case can be solved with ratio (4 / 3 +c), for arbitrary c> 0. In conclusion we use a known result in order to approximately solve the exogenous resp. endogenous routing problem on graphs weighted by a metric. We will study a graph theoretical problem which arises from the mentioned transportation problem. Given a directed graph G=(V,E^rdotcup E^b) with the arc set partitioned into red and blue subsets and a cost function on the arc set, find a minimal cost arborescence spanning G and using at most <b>d</b> <b>blue</b> arcs. Within this work a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) will be presented for this problem. The FPTAS will be used to approximately solve the endogenous transportation problem on a tree...|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} 2 olfactory specific proteins in the gypsy moth Lymantria dispar that are uniquely {{associated with the}} male antennae, the principal olfactory organs of this animal. These proteins were the major soluble protein components of the olfactory sensilla, present in equivalent amounts. Both proteins comigrated on SDS-PAGE, showing an apparent molecular mass of 15, 000 Da but migrated separately on non-SDS-PAGE, indicating differences in net charge. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis showed that the 2 proteins share 50 % identity, indicating that they are genetically distinct homologs. Both proteins bound the L. dispar sexpheromone, associated with antisera prepared against the previously identified phermone-binding protein (PBP) of the moth Antheraea polyphemus, and shared sequence identity with the A. polyphemus PBP. These 2 proteins are therefore identified as L. dispar PBPs and are termed PBP 1 and PBP 2 based on their migration differences on non-SDS-PAGE. It is estimated that PBP 1 and PBP 2 {{are present in the}} sensilla lumen at a combined concentration of 13. 4 mM. The expression of the L. dispar PBPs was examined during the 11 d development of the adult antenna. PBP 1 and PBP 2 were first detected by non-SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie <b>blue</b> staining 3 <b>d</b> before adult eclosion, on day A- 3. Levels increased, reaching a plateau on day A- 1 that continued into adult life. In vivo labeling studies indicated that the rate of PBP synthesis increased from A- 3 to a plateau on A- 2, where it remained into adult life. In vitro translations of antennal mRNAs indicated that translatable PBP mRNA was available at a very low level on day A- 4, increased slightly on A- 3 and dramatically on A- 2, and remained at a high level into adult life. PBP mRNA represented the major translatable mRNA in the antenna during this period. It was estimated that the PBPs undergo a combined steady-state turnover of 8 x 10 (7) molecules/hr/sensillum. Cursory in vivo and in vitro translation studies of antennal mRNA from A. polyphemus and Manduca sexta showed similar temporal patterns of PBP expression, suggesting that the L. dispar observations are general...|$|R
40|$|The visible {{reflectance}} spectrum of many Solar System bodies changes with changing viewing geometry for reasons not fully understood. It is often observed to redden (increasing spectral slope) with increasing solar phase angle, an effect known as phase reddening. Only once, in an {{observation of the}} martian sur- face by the Viking 1 lander, was reddening observed {{up to a certain}} phase angle with <b>bluing</b> beyond, mak- <b>ing</b> the reflectance ratio as a function of phase angle shaped like an arch. However, in laboratory experiments this arch-shape is frequently encountered. To investigate this, we measured the bidirec- tional reflectance of particulate samples of several common rock types in the 400 – 1000 nm wavelength range and performed ray-tracing simulations. We confirm the occurrence of the arch for surfaces that are forward scattering, i. e. are composed of semi-transparent particles and are smooth on the scale of the particles, and for which the reflectance increases from the lower to the higher wavelength in the reflec- tance ratio. The arch shape is reproduced by the simulations, which assume a smooth surface. However, surface roughness on the scale of the particles, such as the Hapke and van Horn (Hapke, B., van Horn, H. [1963]. J. Geophys. Res. 68, 4545 – 4570) fairy castles that can spontaneously form when sprinkling a fine powder, leads to monotonic reddening. A further consequence of this form of microscopic roughness (being indistinct without the use of a microscope) is a flattening of the disk function at visible wave- lengths, i. e. Lommel–Seeliger-type scattering. The experiments further reveal monotonic reddening for reflectance ratios at near-IR wavelengths. The simulations fail to reproduce this particular reddening, and we suspect that it results from roughness {{on the surface of the}} particles. Given that the regolith of atmosphereless Solar System bodies is composed of small particles, our results indicate that the preva- lence of monotonic reddening and Lommel–Seeliger-type scattering for these bodies results from micro- scopic roughness, both in the form of structures built by the particles and roughness on the surface of the particles themselves. It follows from the singular Viking 1 observation that the surface in front of the lander was composed of semi-transparent particles, and was smooth on the scale of the particle size...|$|R
