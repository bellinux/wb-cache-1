5|$|The {{construction}} of the runway itself required the filling of crevasses {{and the removal of}} stones. Troll Airfield was opened on 11 February 2005 by Queen Sonja of Norway and the new research station the following day. After the opening, another power station was built in 2005. In 2006, a satellite base station was built by Kongsberg Satellite Services. This resulted in the need for a <b>broadband</b> <b>connection</b> for the base. During the winter season of 2006, there was no overwintering due to lack of funding, but from 2007 this has been re-instated. In 2008, a windmill was taken into use to provide some of the power.|$|E

Hundreds {{of hours of}} content for the beta trial were made available from ITV plc, Living, Disney, Cartoon Network, National Geographic, Discovery and MTV Networks Europe. The beta trial is open to Virgin Media's XL TV customers who also have a <b>broadband</b> <b>connection</b> with the company. Virgin Media brought more content to Virgin Media Player as the company built towards full launch later in the year. Virgin Mobile pay monthly customers are able to access an hour of Virgin Media Player every day, at no extra charge. Virgin Media Player on mobile launched with 4oD content which was joined by MTV Snax, MTV Music, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central.|$|E
25|$|The Enabling Grids for E-sciencE project, {{based in}} the European Union and {{included}} sites in Asia and the United States, was a follow-up project to the European DataGrid (EDG) and evolved into the European Grid Infrastructure. This, along with the LHC Computing Grid (LCG), was developed to support experiments using the CERN Large Hadron Collider. A list of active sites participating within LCG can be found online as can real time monitoring of the EGEE infrastructure. The relevant software and documentation is also publicly accessible. There is speculation that dedicated fiber optic links, such as those installed by CERN to address the LCG's data-intensive needs, may one day be available to home users thereby providing internet services at speeds up to 10,000 times faster than a traditional <b>broadband</b> <b>connection.</b> The European Grid Infrastructure has been also used for other research activities and experiments such as the simulation of oncological clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft, however, {{hoped that}} the Xbox would succeed where the Dreamcast had failed. The company {{determined}} that intense online gaming required the throughput of a <b>broadband</b> <b>connection</b> and the storage space of a hard disk drive, and thus these features would be vital to the new platform. This would allow not only for significant downloadable content, such as new levels, maps, weapons, challenges and characters, to be downloaded quickly and stored, but also would {{make it possible to}} standardize bandwidth intensive features such as voice communication. Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates both had a vision of making premium download content and add-ons that would attract many new customers. Based on this reasoning, the console included a standard Ethernet port (10/100) in order to provide connectivity to common broadband networks, but did not include a modem or any dial-up support, and its online service was designed to support broadband users only. Critics scoffed at it, citing poor broadband adoption {{at the turn of the}} century.|$|E

25|$|The National Broadband Network was {{initially}} a fibre {{to the home}} (FTTH) open-access network in planning and trial operation in Australia by the federal government. The national broadband network aimed to provide up to 1000 Mbit/s speeds and to connect to 93% of Australian households and businesses. This has since been revised under a Coalition government to a Mixed-Technology system relying largely on Australia's existing and largely depreciated Copper networks. This revision aims for 25 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s, with consumer reports ranging from 1 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s. The Australian government had previously called for proposals to build a Fibre to the Node (FTTN) broadband network providing download speeds up to 100 and upload speeds up to 40Megabits per second. The government also utlilises fixed wireless technology and satellite technology to provide fast <b>broadband</b> <b>connection</b> in rural area and very remote area. Fixed wireless provides speeds up to 50/20 Mbit/s. Satellite technology uses sky muster communication satellite which was launched in October 2015 to provide fast broadband in very remote area. It provides speeds up to 25/5 Mbit/s. The network will be the largest single infrastructure investment in Australia's history. In February 2017, the Federal Government of Australia funded the project for the NBN in order to build a mixed technology network.|$|E
