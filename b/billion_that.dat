In the attempts to meet the launch date, several instruments and a cache for samples were removed and other instruments and cameras were simplified to simplify testing and integration of the rover. The next month, NASA delayed the launch to late 2011 because of inadequate testing time. Eventually the costs for developing the rover reached $2.47 <b>billion,</b> <b>that</b> for a rover that initially had been classified as a medium-cost mission with a maximum budget of $650 million, yet NASA still had to ask for an additional $82 million to meet the planned November launch.|$|E

25|$|The {{authorities}} were shocked when {{they opened the}} bids on the proposed tower portion and only a single bid for US$1.4 billion was received, considerably more than their estimate of around $780 million. This was partially because of {{a rise in the}} cost of steel and concrete, particularly {{as a result of the}} concurrent building boom in China, but also due to construction uncertainties owing to the innovative design. The entire project, requiring 100,000 tons of structural steel, was expected to cost $6.2 billion as of July 2005, up from a 1997 estimate of $1.1 billion (for a simple viaduct) and a March 2003 estimate of $2.6 <b>billion</b> <b>that</b> included a tower span.

25|$|Pathmark {{was a large}} New York-area {{chain that}} was one of A's major {{competitors}} when it was acquired in 2007. Pathmark, originally known as Supermarkets General, was formed in 1956 as a subgroup of the Wakefern co-operative known as ShopRite. When Supermarkets General broke from ShopRite in 1968, it converted its 81 stores to Pathmark. By 1977, Pathmark started to build larger stores with pharmacies. To overcome a hostile takeover in 1987, Pathmark's management instituted a leveraged buyout of $2.7 <b>billion</b> <b>that</b> committed it to make large debt payments. In 2000, Pathmark entered bankruptcy; after it was reorganized, Yucaipa Holding purchased 40% of Pathmark for $150 million. At the time of its 2007 purchase by A, Pathmark operated 141 stores and had a capitalization of $634 million. Many Pathmark stores were still in operation when A began liquidation. The brand has been sold to Foodtown, but is not currently in use for stores.|$|E
25|$|During the {{economic}} boom years of the Davis administration, the California budget expanded to cover Davis' new programs. California's low national K-12 education rankings and Davis' campaign pledge to help education, along with the large majority that elected Davis to his first term and his early popularity, suggest {{that a majority of}} Californians supported increases in education spending during the early part of his first term when California was in budget surplus. Polls also showed that increased spending in education was supported by the California voters. Under the Davis administration, taxes were cut by over $5.1 <b>billion</b> <b>that</b> included a $3.5 billion cut in sales tax and a reduction in the vehicle licensing fees. The cut in sales taxes was mandated due to a 1991 law that required sales taxes to be reduced a quarter percent when budget reserves exceed 4 percent of the state general fund for two straight fiscal years which they did in 1999 and 2000. Davis also vetoed $5.1 billion in appropriations during that span.|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{investment}} {{remains a}} strong element in China's rapid expansion in world trade {{and has been}} an important factor in the growth of urban jobs. In 1998, foreign-invested enterprises produced about 40% of China's exports, and foreign exchange reserves totalled about $145billion. Foreign-invested enterprises today produce about half of China's exports (the majority of China's foreign investment come from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), and China continues to attract large investment inflows. However, the Chinese government's emphasis on guiding FDI into manufacturing has led to market saturation in some industries, while leaving China's services sectors underdeveloped. From 1993 to 2001, China was the world's second-largest recipient of foreign direct investment after the United States. China received $39billionFDI in 1999 and $41billionFDI in 2000. China {{is now one of the}} leading FDI recipients in the world, receiving almost $80billion in 2005 according to World Bank statistics. In 2006, China received $69.47billion in foreign direct investment. By 2011, with the U.S. seeing a decline in foreign investment following the 2008 financial crisis, China overtook it as the top destination for FDI, receiving over $280 <b>billion</b> <b>that</b> year.|$|E
