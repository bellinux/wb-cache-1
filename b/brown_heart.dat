50|$|Carl had his son Howard farmed {{the land}} till the {{money could be}} saved and raised to start putting in street, {{electricity}} and city water. Home building and the Casa Linda Plaza Shopping Center then had a base to be built from. Casa Linda Theatre was the first building completed after World War II. All the deed restrictions were placed in 1939 to make the area a first class neighborhood for families. The homes were effectively built out by 1960 by land owner, Carl Martin Brown and his oldest son, Howard D. Brown and Corinne Brown Walton, Carl's daughter. They joined forces to make the area known as Casa Linda their lifetime work and greatest achievement.The Browns turned their family farm into homes called Casa Linda Estates and a shopping center called Casa Linda Plaza, though a few vacant lots remained until the early 1960s for future homes and the last store {{to be built in}} Casa Linda Plaza was a Kroger grocery built in 1971. The architectural styles of the homes vary, and some excellent examples of Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture {{can be found in the}} area and also the shopping center. Howard D. Brown loved the Spanish language and named all the streets using Spanish words. The area is heavily treed, and most homes display well-kept and in some cases elaborate landscaping, many have servants quarters built in the back of the property that today can be used for rentals or guest accommodations. The Brown Family created a place where all items for every day needs could be purchased in Casa Linda Plaza with schools and fire house near by. The Brown family owned the shopping center till Howard D. Brown decided to sell in late 1978 due to leukemia. Howard Brown's daughter, Beverly Ann <b>Brown</b> <b>Heart,</b> was a home builder in Dallas, Richardson, Garland and Rockwall Texas, continuing till the mid 1980s the family tradition of building. As of 2015 Casa Linda is still going strong with new tenants like Chili's restaurant along with old tenants like El Fenix Restaurant that has been there since mid 1950s.|$|E

40|$|Core {{breakdown}} is a pear disorder characterised by the softening and browning {{of tissue}} near the core. It {{is a serious}} disorder that causes large economical losses in Belgium. This disorder is believed to occur during storage in too high carbon dioxide conditions. Over mature fruit {{seems to be more}} susceptible to core breakdown during storage. In this study research is done on factors that influence the development of the disorder such as the carbon dioxide concentration, the oxygen concentration, the size of the pear, the colour, the picking date, the storage temperature and the pear variety (Pyrus communis cv. conference and Pyrus communis cv. doyenne du commice). A relation is established between the occurence of <b>brown</b> <b>heart</b> disorder and storage conditions, the picking date, the size and the colour. The variety conference is very sensitive for storage in high carbon dioxide and low oxygen concentrations. The picking date influences the development of core breakdown as well.

40|$|A {{review of}} the main results {{obtained}} by Time-resolved Reflectance Spectroscopy (TRS) and of its possible applications {{for the detection of}} inner attributes and defects in fruit is presented. Common spectroscopy techniques employ continuous wave light and measure the diffusively remitted intensity which is determined by both the absorption and the scattering properties of the sample. Light absorption is related to chemical properties, while scattering to physical structure. Quantification of absorption and scattering may be obtained by space- or time-resolved methods. TRS is a technique based on the measurement of the temporal delay and broadening experienced by a short laser pulse while traveling through a turbid medium and explores a volume of pulp at a depth of 1 - 2 cm. TRS has been used to detect some internal defects and disorders in the intact fruit, such as <b>brown</b> <b>heart,</b> internal browning, internal bruises, water soaked tissue, as well as internal attributes related to maturity, texture and cell wall structure. The scattering coefficient was found {{to be related to the}} translucency of tissue and was used to detect internal bruises and water soaked tissue (i. e., water core in apples and Botrytis decayed kiwifruits). The scattering coefficient was related to pectin composition and textural properties of apples such as firmness and mealiness. Absorption coefficient in the 600 - 700 nm region can detect <b>brown</b> <b>heart</b> in pears and internal browning in apples. The absorption coefficient at 670 nm is related to fruit maturity and it was used in nectarines to predict their softening time and to detect too immature fruit which are not able to ripen. Being non-destructive, TRS measurements can be repeated on the same fruit, following the development and the changes occurring with ripening or storag...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Pears (Pyrus communis L. cv. ‘Rocha’) {{were exposed}} to air or {{controlled}} atmosphere (CA) containing various concentrations of CO 2 : 0, 0. 5 and 5 kPa, all with 2 kPa O 2. After 4 months of storage at 2 ◦C, the fruits were transferred to air at room temperature, and assessed in terms of soluble solids, titratable acidity, pH, incidence of <b>brown</b> <b>heart</b> and flesh browning, phenolic content, vitamin C content and polyphenol oxidase activity. By 4 months of storage, soluble solids and pH increased, and acidity decreased relative to harvest, but no differences were detected between pears stored under air {{or any of the}} CA tested. Higher contents of hydroxycinnamic derivatives and flavan- 3 -ols in the peel than in the flesh were recorded. However, the content of arbutin was higher in the flesh than in the peel, whereas flavonols were only detected in the peel. In general, hydroxycinnamic derivatives and flavonols were stable throughout storage, but flavan- 3 -ols decreased in concentration under air or CA. Arbutin was the only phenolic compound that increased in concentration as time elapsed. No clear relation was found between the storage conditions tested and the phenolic concentration in pears. Regarding ascorbic acid (AA) and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), their concentrations were higher in the peel than in the flesh. Furthermore, AA and DHA were strongly affected by storage: the former decreased, whereas the latter increased in content. A decrease in PPO activity was apparent after harvest and during storage, particularly under higher levels of CO 2. The combination 2 kPa O 2 + 5 kPa CO 2 increased the incidence of internal disorders (viz. <b>brown</b> <b>heart</b> and flesh browning) after storage...|$|E
