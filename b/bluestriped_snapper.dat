40|$|International audienceThe <b>bluestriped</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus kasmira and the {{blacktail}} snapper L. fulvus were deliberately {{introduced in the}} Hawaiian Archipelago from French Polynesia in the late 1950 s to enhance local fisheries. These species rapidly spread all over the Windward Islands, became extremely abundant and, therefore, caused controversial environmental concerns. A comparison of the whole metazoan parasite community of L. kasmira and L. fulvus was performed between their native ranges in French Polynesia (Moorea Island in the Society Archipelago and Ua Huka in the Marquesas Islands) and their introduced range in O'ahu, Hawaii, USA. We suggest that 8 monogenean species have been introduced with L. kasmira and L. fulvus into the Hawaiian Archipelago from French Polynesia; 2 other species {{as well as one}} nematode should be referred to as cryptogenic. Moreover, experimental mortality conducted on monogeneans found in Polynesia emphasizes the inefficiency of anti-parasite treatment which was performed 50 yr ago, explaining possible parasite introduction. Finally, we discuss the potential threat of exotic parasites to the native fish community in the Hawaiian Archipelago and conclude that the absence of co-evolved hosts prevents parasite transfer from non-indigenous to native fishes as monogeneans are highly specific...|$|E

40|$|Efforts {{to limit}} the impact of {{invasive}} species are frustrated by the cryptogenic status of {{a large proportion of}} those species. Half a century ago, the state of Hawai’i introduced the <b>Bluestripe</b> <b>Snapper,</b> Lutjanus kasmira, to O’ahu for fisheries enhancement. Today, this species shares an intestinal nematode parasite, Spirocamallanus istiblenni, with native Hawaiian fishes, raising the possibility that the introduced fish carried a parasite that has since spread to naı̈ve local hosts. Here, we employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining molecular, historical, and ecological data to confirm the alien status of S. istiblenni in Hawai’i. Using molecular sequence data we show that S. istiblenni from Hawai’i are genetically affiliated with source populations in French Polynesia, and not parasites at a geographically intermediate location in the Line Islands. S. istiblenni from Hawai’i are a genetic subset of the more diverse source populations, indicating a bottleneck at introduction. Ecological surveys indicate that the parasite has found suitable intermediate hosts in Hawai’i, which are required for the completion of its life cycle, and that the parasite is twice as prevalent in Hawaiian <b>Bluestripe</b> <b>Snappers</b> as in source populations. While the introduced snapper has spread across the entire 2600 km archipelago to Kure Atoll, the introduce...|$|R
25|$|Some fishes {{associated}} with reefs are generalized carnivores that feed {{on a variety}} of animal prey. These typically have large mouths that can be rapidly expanded, thereby drawing in nearby water and any unfortunate animals contained within the inhaled water mass. The water is then expelled through the gills with the mouth closed, thereby trapping the helpless prey For example, the <b>bluestripe</b> <b>snapper</b> has a varied diet, feeding on fishes, shrimps, crabs, stomatopods, cephalopods and planktonic crustaceans, as well as plant and algae material. Diet varies with age, location and the prevalent prey items locally.|$|R

The yellowfin goatfish (Mulloidichthys vanicolensis) often schools with the blue-striped snapper. The yellowfins change their colouration to match that of the snapper.

They feed on worms, crustaceans, molluscs and other small invertebrates. Other fish shadow the active goatfish, waiting patiently for any overlooked prey. For example, in Indonesia large schools of the l goldsaddle goatfish (Parupeneus cyclostomus) and moray eels hunting together. This behavior is known as shadow feeding or cooperative hunting.By day, many goatfishes will form large schools of inactive (non feeding) fish; these aggregates may contain both conspecifics and heterospecifics. For example, the yellowfin goatfish (Mulloidichthys vanicolensis) is often seen congregating with <b>bluestripe</b> <b>snappers</b> (Lutjanus kasmira). All goatfishes {{have the ability to}} change their coloration depending on their current activity. One notable example, the diurnal goldsaddle goatfish (Parupeneus cyclostomus) will change from a lemon-yellow to a pale cream whilst feeding.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{study focused}} on {{small-scale}} location and movement patterns of the <b>bluestripe</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus kasmira on the north coast of Moorea (Society Archipelago, French Polynesia, southcentral Pacific). Juveniles of this species occur in the estuary, and adults occur widely in the lagoon, the outer slope and in the intermediate channel, where fish aggregate in large schools during daytime. While fish were all sampled within a few hundred metres, they exhibited significantly different parasite fauna and otolith shapes according to their locality: estuary, lagoon, channel and outer slope. While juveniles did not exhibit any parasites in the estuary parasitological and otolith-shape data suggest that adults rarely move between their three adjoining habitats, and more interestingly that large aggregations in the channel are formed predominantly by resident individuals with limited local movement, including at night. Besides giving some information on the host biology, such findings may have application in local fisheries management...|$|R
40|$|A {{half century}} ago the State of Hawaii began a remarkable, if unintentional, {{experiment}} {{on the population}} genetics of introduced species, by releasing 2431 <b>Bluestriped</b> <b>Snappers</b> (Lutjanus kasmira) from the Marquesas Islands in 1958 and 728 conspecifics from the Society Islands in 1961. By 1992 L. kasmira had spread across the entire archipelago, including locations 2000 km from the release site. Genetic surveys of the source populations reveal diagnostic differences in the mtDNA control region (d = 3. 8 %; φST = 0. 734, P < 0. 001) and significant allele frequency differences at nuclear DNA loci (FST = 0. 49; P < 0. 001). These findings, which indicate that source populations have been isolated for approximately half a million years, {{set the stage for}} a survey of the Hawaiian Archipelago (N = 385) to determine the success of these introductions in terms of genetic diversity and breeding behaviour. Both Marquesas and Society mtDNA lineages were detected at each survey site across the Hawaiian Archipelago, at about the same proportion or slightly less than the original 3. 4 : 1 introduction ratio. Nuclear allele frequencies and parentage tests demonstrate that the two source populations are freely interbreeding. The introduction of 2431 Marquesan founders produced only a slight reduction in mtDNA diversity (17 %), while the 728 Society founders produced a greater reduction in haplotype diversity (41 %). We find no evidence of genetic bottlenecks between islands of the Hawaiian Archipelago, as expected under a stepping-stone model of colonization, from the initial introduction site. This species rapidly colonized across 2000 km without loss of genetic diversity, illustrating the consequences of introducing highly dispersive marine species...|$|R
40|$|Assessing {{patterns}} of connectivity {{at the community}} and population levels is relevant to marine resource management and conservation. The present study reviews this issue {{with a focus on}} the western Indian Ocean (WIO) biogeographic province. This part of the Indian Ocean holds more species than expected from current models of global reef fish species richness. In this study, checklists of reef fish species were examined to determine levels of endemism in each of 10 biogeographic provinces of the Indian Ocean. Results showed that the number of endemic species was higher in the WIO than in any other region of the Indian Ocean. Endemic species from the WIO on the average had a larger body size than elsewhere in the tropical Indian Ocean. This suggests an effect of peripheral speciation, as previously documented in the Hawaiian reef fish fauna, relative to other sites in the tropical western Pacific. To explore evolutionary dynamics of species across biogeographic provinces and infer mechanisms of speciation, we present and compare the results of phylogeographic surveys based on compilations of published and unpublished mitochondrial DNA sequences for 19 Indo-Pacific reef-associated fishes (rainbow grouper Cephalopholis argus, scrawled butterflyfish Chaetodon meyeri, bluespot mullet Crenimugil sp. A, humbug damselfish Dascyllus abudafur/Dascyllus aruanus, areolate grouper Epinephelus areolatus, blacktip grouper Epinephelus fasciatus, honeycomb grouper Epinephelus merra, bluespotted cornetfish Fistularia commersonii, cleaner wrasse Labroides sp. 1, longface emperor Lethrinus sp. A, <b>bluestripe</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus kasmira, unicornfishes Naso brevirosris, Naso unicornis and Naso vlamingii, blue-spotted maskray Neotrygon kuhlii, largescale mullet Planiliza macrolepis, common parrotfish Scarus psicattus, crescent grunter Terapon jarbua, whitetip reef shark Triaenodon obelus) and three coastal Indo-West Pacific invertebrates (blue seastar Linckia laevigata, spiny lobster Panulirus homarus, small giant clam Tridacna maxima). Heterogeneous and often unbalanced sampling design, paucity of data in a number of cases, and among-species discrepancy in phylogeographic structure precluded any generalization regarding phylogeographic patterns. Nevertheless, the WIO might have been a source of haplotypes in some cases and it also harboured an endemic clade in at least one case. The present survey also highlighted likely cryptic species. This may eventually affect the accuracy of the current checklists of species, which form the basis of some of the recent advances in Indo-West Pacific marine ecology and biogeography...|$|R
