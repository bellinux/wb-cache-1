The standard deviation of the threshold voltage variation depends on the absolute size of the devices, the minimum feature size of the manufacturing process, and the <b>body</b> <b>voltage</b> and is typically 1 to 3 millivolts. Therefore to keep the contribution of the threshold voltage term in equation (9) to a percent or less requires biasing the transistors with the gate-source voltage exceeding the threshold by several tenths of a volt. This has the subsidiary effect of lowering the contribution of the mirror transistors to the output current noise because the drain current noise density in a MOSFET is proportional to the transconductance and therefore inversely proportional to [...]|$|E

40|$|The {{tunneling}} {{field-effect transistor}} (TFET) {{is one of}} the most promising candidates for future low-power electronics because of its potential to achieve a subthreshold swing less than the 60 mV/decade thermal limit at room temperature. It can surpass this limit because the turn-on of tunneling does not sample the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of carriers that gives rise to the 60 mV/decade limit in conventional devices. However, theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of TFET device characteristics have differed by a wide margin-experimental subthreshold characteristics have not achieved the switching steepness (i. e., the change in drain current with applied gate voltage) of theoretical simulations. Non-ideal effects, such as non-abrupt band edges, phonon-assisted tunneling, and trap states, are discussed as mechanisms that may degrade theoretical predications. A strained-Si/strained-Ge bilayer TFET is used as a test-bed device to better understand the discrepancy between simulation and experiment. The bilayer TFET studied in this work eliminates channel doping and uses the strained-Si/strained-Ge heterostructure. Band-to-band tunneling occurs perpendicular to the gate, in-line with the gate electric field. Multiple gates are used so that the impact of the directionality of tunneling on switching abruptness can be studied. The band alignment of the strained-Si/strained-Ge heterostructure is extracted from a MOS-capacitor structure though an experimental quasistatic CV technique. The extracted effective band gap (related to the tunneling barrier) is shown to be only - 200 meV for the heterostructure, and the valence band offset is shown to be - 100 meV larger than predicted by density-functional theory. New deformation potentials are suggested for the Si-Ge material system based on the experimentally extracted band alignments. The impact of quantization on the turn-on voltage and gate-leakage current in a thin-body bilayer TFET structure is studied, and large confinement energy is shown to be especially problematic at body thicknesses less than 10 nm. An InAs structure with a body thickness less than 7 nm is shown to require a larger turn-on voltage than either Si or Ge homostructures due to the very light electron mass in InAs that leads to a large confinement energy. The strained- Si/strained-Ge heterostructure is shown to dramatically reduce the turn-on voltage due to its small effective band gap. Quantization is shown to limit the gate efficiency since increasing the <b>body</b> <b>voltage,</b> in order to align the electron and hole eigenstates in energy, increases the electric field across the structure, which in turn increases quantization. Gate leakage current increases exponentially as the body thickness decreases because the <b>body</b> <b>voltage</b> (and hence, the electric field) at turn-on increases with decreasing body thickness and gate leakage is exponentially dependent on the electric field. Non-ideal two-dimensional effects are investigated as mechanisms that degrade the switching characteristics of perpendicular TFETs (i. e. devices with tunneling perpendicular to the gate). Abrupt termination of a heavily doped semiconductor layer, often present in perpendicular TFET structures, can lead to large in-plane electric fields that give rise to parasitic diagonal tunneling paths, as opposed to the desired perpendicular tunneling paths. While the turn-on of each leakage path may be individually sharp, the sum of all tunneling paths is smeared by the multiple turn-ons and results in a degraded transfer characteristic for the device. The characteristic length, used for determining the length scale of potential fluctuations in short-channel MOSFETs, is suggested as a parameter that can be used to evaluate the likelihood of parasitic tunneling paths in a perpendicular TFET structure. The fabrication of the 3 Gate strained-Si/strained-Ge bilayer TFET is detailed. The process includes epitaxial growth of a highly strained heterostructure, planarization of a bottom gate, wafer bonding of an epitaxial wafer to a handle wafer, etch-back of the epitaxial wafer leaving the thin strained-Si/strained-Ge heterostructure, and standard processing to create devices. Future work on electrical characterization of the experimental 3 Gate bilayer TFET is discussed. Several test configurations are suggested as a way to probe the effects of diagonal tunneling on the abruptness of the switching characteristics. by James Towfik Teherani. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Modern digital {{communication}} systems target satisfying multiple standards and different operating scenarios. Applications include read channels of data storage systems, PCIe links, FPGA I/Os, and multi-standard radios. This stimulates {{the research on}} reconfigurable analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) {{to serve as a}} key building block at the front-end of such systems. Conventional reconfigurable designs suffer from poor figure-of-merit (FoM) scaling with different resolutions, which reduces their flexibility. The limited efficiency of these techniques is attributed {{to the fact that they}} fix the ADC architecture for all configurations, whereas the optimum architecture depends on the target resolution. This dissertation introduces an architecture reconfigurable ADC that efficiently covers a wide range of resolutions by configuring the ADC to the proper architecture for each resolution. This leads to a reconfigurable ADC nearly as efficient as dedicated designs in both area and power. Device matching is the heart of precision analog design. Basically, well matched devices come at the expense of larger die, parasitic capacitance and power consumption. Instead of only sizing the devices to achieve the desired accuracy, the intrinsic accuracy of an area efficient converter is designed worse than its resolution. Before or during chip usage, self-calibration automatically detects and corrects for elements mismatches and leads to reduced silicon area and improved yield. This dissertation investigates the efficiency of using <b>body</b> <b>voltage</b> trimming calibration for data converters. The tradeoffs of this technique are studied in details. Suggested methods have been presented to extend the use of bulk voltage trimming beyond technology limitations with minimal area and power overhead and no special technology requirements. The study shows that best results are achieved when mixing bulk trimming with other calibration techniques. Two prototype chips are implemented in 65 -nm CMOS to verify the results of this study.

40|$|The nano-age {{has already}} begun, where typical feature {{dimensions}} {{are smaller than}} 100 nm. The operating frequency {{is expected to increase}} up to 12 GHz, and a single chip will contain over 12 billion transistors in 2020, as given by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) initiative. ITRS also predicts that the scaling of CMOS devices and process technology, as it is known today, will become much more difficult as the industry advances towards the 16 nm technology node and further. This aggressive scaling of CMOS technology has pushed the devices to their physical limits. Design goals are governed by several factors other than power, performance and area such as process variations, radiation induced soft errors, and aging degradation mechanisms. These new design challenges have a strong impact on the parametric yield of nanometer digital circuits and also result in functional yield losses in variation-sensitive digital circuits such as Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) and flip-flops. Moreover, sub-threshold SRAM and flip-flops circuits, which are aggravated by the strong demand for lower power consumption, show larger sensitivity to these challenges which reduces their robustness and yield. Accordingly, {{it is not surprising that}} the ITRS considers variability and reliability as the most challenging obstacles for nanometer digital circuits robust design. Soft errors are considered one of the main reliability and robustness concerns in SRAM arrays in sub- 100 nm technologies due to low operating voltage, small node capacitance, and high packing density. The SRAM arrays soft errors immunity is also affected by process variations. We develop statistical design-oriented soft errors immunity variations models for super-threshold and sub-threshold SRAM cells accounting for die-to-die variations and within-die variations. This work provides new design insights and highlights the important design knobs that can be used to reduce the SRAM cells soft errors immunity variations. The developed models are scalable, bias dependent, and only require the knowledge of easily measurable parameters. This makes them useful in early design exploration, circuit optimization as well as technology prediction. The derived models are verified using Monte Carlo SPICE simulations, referring to an industrial hardware-calibrated 65 nm CMOS technology. The demand for higher performance leads to very deep pipelining which means that hundreds of thousands of flip-flops are required to control the data flow under strict timing constraints. A violation of the timing constraints at a flip-flop can result in latching incorrect data causing the overall system to malfunction. In addition, the flip-flops power dissipation represents a considerable fraction of the total power dissipation. Sub-threshold flip-flops are considered the most energy efficient solution for low power applications in which, performance is of secondary importance. Accordingly, statistical gate sizing is conducted to different flip-flops topologies for timing yield improvement of super-threshold flip-flops and power yield improvement of sub-threshold flip-flops. Following that, a comparative analysis between these flip-flops topologies considering the required overhead for yield improvement is performed. This comparative analysis provides useful recommendations that help flip-flops designers on selecting the best flip-flops topology that satisfies their system specifications while taking the process variations impact and robustness requirements into account. Adaptive Body Bias (ABB) allows the tuning of the transistor threshold voltage, Vt, by controlling the transistor <b>body</b> <b>voltage.</b> A forward body bias reduces Vt, increasing the device speed at the expense of increased leakage power. Alternatively, a reverse body bias increases Vt, reducing the leakage power but slowing the device. Therefore, the impact of process variations is mitigated by speeding up slow and less leaky devices or slowing down devices that are fast and highly leaky. Practically, the implementation of the ABB is desirable to bias each device in a design independently, to mitigate within-die variations. However, supplying so many separate voltages inside a die results in a large area overhead. On the other hand, using the same body bias for all devices on the same die limits its capability to compensate for within-die variations. Thus, the granularity level of the ABB scheme is a trade-off between the within-die variations compensation capability and the associated area overhead. This work introduces new ABB circuits that exhibit lower area overhead by a factor of 143 X than that of previous ABB circuits. In addition, these ABB circuits are resolution free since no digital-to-analog converters or analog-to-digital converters are required on their implementations. These ABB circuits are adopted to high performance critical paths, emulating a real microprocessor architecture, for process variations compensation and also adopted to SRAM arrays, for Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) aging and process variations compensation. The effectiveness of the new ABB circuits is verified by post layout simulation results and test chip measurements using triple-well 65 nm CMOS technology. The highly capacitive nodes of wide fan-in dynamic circuits and SRAM bitlines limit the performance of these circuits. In addition, process variations mitigation by statistical gate sizing increases this capacitance further and fails in achieving the target yield improvement. We propose new negative capacitance circuits that reduce the overall parasitic capacitance of these highly capacitive nodes. These negative capacitance circuits are adopted to wide fan-in dynamic circuits for timing yield improvement up to 99. 87 % and to SRAM arrays for read access yield improvement up to 100 %. The area and power overheads of these new negative capacitance circuits are amortized over the large die area of the microprocessor and the SRAM array. The effectiveness of the new negative capacitance circuits is verified by post layout simulation results and test chip measurements using 65 nm CMOS technology...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic voltage {{selection}} and adaptive body biasing {{have been shown}} to reduce dynamic and leakage power consumption effectively. In this paper, we optimally solve the combined supply <b>voltage</b> and <b>body</b> bias selection problem for multi-processor systems with imposed time constraints, explicitly taking into account the transition overheads implied by changing voltage levels. Both energy and time overheads are considered. The voltage selection technique achieves energy efficiency by simultaneously scaling the supply and <b>body</b> bias <b>voltages</b> in the case of processors and buses with repeaters, while energy efficiency on fat wires is achieved through dynamic voltage swing scaling. We investigate the continuous voltage selection as well as its discrete counterpart, and we prove strong NP-hardness in the discrete case. Furthermore, the continuous voltage selection problem is solved using nonlinear programming with polynomial time complexity, while for the discrete problem we use mixed integer linear programming and a polynomial time heuristic. We propose an approach that combines voltage {{selection and}} processor shutdown in order to optimize the total energy...|$|R
40|$|Vectorcardiography is a {{technique}} focused on the spatial representation of the cardiac vector. Many vectorcardiographic systems have been proposed over the years, and Frank’s lead system is the most extended one. Frank’s system uses orthogonal lead axis corrected by fixed coefficients. We propose a novel vectorcardiographic lead system based on Jouve’s theories, where correction coefficients are computed for each patient according to electrical measurements taken over the body surface. First, the centre of symmetry (O point) is obtained by the estimation of the whole <b>body</b> surface <b>voltage</b> distribution. This O point {{is considered to be}} the electrical origin of the cardiac vector and any orthogonal axis system centred on it can be used. Correction coefficients for any lead system are then computed from the amplitude ratios found on the body. This system does not use approximations of correction coefficients as proposed by Frank and other author and so, {{it appears to be a}} more accurate representation of the electrical cardiac vector 1...|$|R
40|$|Power {{dissipation}} is a {{key consideration}} {{in the design of}} nano-scale CMOS VLSI circuits. Various techniques have been proposed for reduction of leakage in CMOS transistors. As the technology is emerging power dissipation due to leakage current has become a major contributor of total power consumption in the integrated devices. For high performance and device reliability, reduction of power consumption is highly desirable. Thus the importance of low power circuits has increased currently. The trend of scaling down has led to the increase in sub threshold leakage current and hence static power consumption. In this paper the different leakage reduction techniques for deep submicron technologies are focused comprehensively. The predominating sub threshold leakage current problem can be overcome by techniques like stacking of transistors, power gating, optimal <b>body</b> bias <b>voltage</b> generation at the circuit level thus providing a large range of choices for low-leakage power VLSI designers.
