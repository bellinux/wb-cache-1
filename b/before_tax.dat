25|$|Recent {{reforms to}} the NHS have {{included}} {{changes to the}} GP contract. General practitioners are now not required to work unsociable hours, and get paid to some extent according to their performance, e.g. numbers of patients treated, what treatments were administered, {{and the health of}} their catchment area, through the Quality and Outcomes Framework.

The amount that a GP can expect to earn does vary according to the location of their work and the health needs of the population that they serve. Within a couple of years of the new contract being introduced it became apparent that there were a few examples where the arrangements were out step with what had been expected. A full-time self-employed GP, such as a GMS or PMS practice partner, might currently expect to earn a profit share of around £95,900 <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> while a GP employed by a CCG could expect to earn a salary in the range of £54,863 to £82,789.
