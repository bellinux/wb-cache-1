5|$|A luxurious ball {{followed}} the wedding on 20 May. Louis Stanislas found his wife repulsive; she was considered ugly, tedious, and {{ignorant of the}} customs of the court of Versailles. The marriage remained unconsummated for years. Biographers disagree about the reason. The most common theories propose Louis Stanislas' alleged impotence (according to biographer Antonia Fraser) or his unwillingness to sleep with his wife due to her poor personal hygiene. She never <b>brushed</b> <b>her</b> teeth, plucked her eyebrows, or used any perfumes. At {{the time of his}} marriage, Louis Stanislas was obese and waddled instead of walked. He never exercised and continued to eat enormous amounts of food.|$|E
2500|$|Caruso said by {{the time}} the film came to {{fruition}} twelve years later, [...] "the technology had finally caught up to the storytelling... Everybody has a BlackBerry on their belt, and we think we're constantly being tracked. It's less science fiction than when Steven Spielberg conceived it." [...] Caruso wanted to bring a gritty, 1970s-era sensibility to the film. Accordingly, a key chase scene in a high-tech package-processing hub on conveyor belts was shot without the use of computer-generated imagery. [...] "It was like Chutes and Ladders for adults. It was pretty dangerous, and a lot of fun." [...] While filming the scene, Monaghan suffered a welt after a cable <b>brushed</b> <b>her</b> neck and Caruso hit his head on a protruding bolt, requiring stitches.|$|E
2500|$|In the decision, {{the grand}} jury noted many {{problems}} with Brawley's story. Among these were that the rape kit results did not indicate sexual assault. Additionally, despite her claim of having been held captive outdoors for days, Brawley was not suffering from hypothermia, was well-nourished, and appeared to have <b>brushed</b> <b>her</b> teeth recently. Despite her clothing being charred, there were no burns on her body. Although a shoe she was wearing was cut through, Brawley had no injuries to her foot. The racial epithets written on her were upside down, which led to suspicion that Brawley had written the words. Testimony from her schoolmates indicated she had attended a local party {{during the time of}} her supposed abduction. One witness claimed to have observed Brawley's climbing into the garbage bag. The feces on her body were identified as coming from her neighbor's dog. [...] Brawley never testified.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Bennett, Henry Krieger, Tom Eyen, and the Dreamgirls {{producers}} {{denied any}} {{connections between the}} musical's plot and the Supremes' life stories; however {{the similarities between the}} show and actual life events within the Supremes led many to believe that the creators did actually base the musical's story on the group. It is widely believed the producers denied connections in order to avoid lawsuits from Motown, Berry Gordy, and the Supremes. Mary Wilson loved Dreamgirls so much that she named her first autobiography, [...] after the musical. Diana Ross performed [...] "Family" [...] from Act I in her historic free concert in New York City's Central Park, in July, 1983. Rumors existed Ross had seen the musical and stormed {{out at the end of}} Act I although it is unconfirmed whether this is true. Though the Deena character mirrors Diana Ross, actress Sheryl Lee Ralph stated that she was not trying to imitate Ross, but, portrayed Deena in a similar, yet distinct, style. In a [...] interview from 2014, Ralph had said Michael Bennett instructed her not to portray Deena like Diana Ross or else they would be sued. In the same interview, Ralph said she encountered Ross in New York shortly after the musical's opening where Ross coldly <b>brushed</b> <b>her</b> off leading to the speculation Ross knew of the show or had seen it.|$|E
