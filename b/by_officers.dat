An evacuation of the area was undertaken by police officers from Bootle Street police station, supplemented <b>by</b> <b>officers</b> drafted into Manchester to control the football crowds. The police were helped by security guards from local shops.|$|E
5|$|During its {{operational}} life {{two of the}} Cabinet War Rooms were of particular importance. Once operational, the facility's Map Room was in constant use and manned around the clock <b>by</b> <b>officers</b> of the Royal Navy, British army and Royal Air Force. These officers were responsible for producing a daily intelligence summary for the King, Prime Minister and the military Chiefs of Staff.|$|E
5|$|However as {{the army}} took shape, French {{officers}} were allocated to units as they presented themselves for duty, so that many units were commanded <b>by</b> <b>officers</b> the soldiers didn't know, and often didn't trust. Crucially, {{some of these}} officers had little experience in working together as a unified force, so that support for other units was often not given.|$|E

The {{driver of the}} car, Dr. William Secare, is cornered <b>by</b> <b>officers</b> but fights them off with surprising ease. Secare is shot as he runs up a gangplank and leaps off a ship into the water. The police fail to locate him but discover that his blood is green.|$|E

5|$|A {{variant of}} the {{extended}} version used in desert border patrol makes use of a high-ceilinged canopy to allow a swivelling rear-facing heavy machine-gun mount, while the canopy can be extended to provide a mobile command post. An air conditioned hardtop version of the extended model is often used <b>by</b> <b>officers,</b> and a version developed for riot control has clear polycarbonate shielding along the rear sides and roof, as well as gunports for less-lethal weapons. The shielding allows for a wide field of view {{while at the same}} time protecting against firebombs and rock-throwing.|$|E
5|$|Charlton {{arrived at}} C Company of the regiment's 1st Battalion in early 1951, {{and at first}} was {{regarded}} with suspicion <b>by</b> <b>officers</b> and leaders in his unit. A Sergeant, he was made a squad leader in the 3rd Platoon, and quickly impressed his unit's company commander with his natural leadership ability, and soon his squad was considered a model unit. In May 1951, Charlton was made the platoon sergeant and his commander had recommended him for a battlefield commission.|$|E
5|$|In early AD 41, Caligula {{was assassinated}} {{as a result}} of a {{conspiracy}} <b>by</b> <b>officers</b> of the Praetorian Guard, senators, and courtiers. The conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted, however. On the day of the assassination of Caligula, the Praetorians declared Caligula's uncle, Claudius the next Roman emperor. Although the Julio-Claudian dynasty continued to rule the empire until the fall of Nero in AD 68, Caligula's death marked the official end of the Julii Caesares in the male line.|$|E

5|$|Norton {{spent his}} days {{inspecting}} San Francisco's streets in an elaborate blue uniform with gold-plated epaulettes, given to him <b>by</b> <b>officers</b> of the United States Army post at the Presidio of San Francisco. He also wore a beaver hat decorated with a peacock feather and a rosette. He frequently enhanced this regal posture with a cane or umbrella. During his inspections, Norton would examine {{the condition of the}} sidewalks and cable cars, the state of repair of public property, and the appearance of police officers. Norton would also frequently give lengthy philosophical expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot.|$|E
5|$|Powerful vested {{interests}} and corrupt commanders were, as of February 2011, the largest obstacle to reforming the army. Some newly delivered weaponry was sold <b>by</b> <b>officers.</b> The International Crisis Group {{also said that}} AMISOM's efforts at assisting in formalizing the military's structure and providing training to the estimated 8,000 SNA soldiers were problematic. Resistance continued {{to the establishment of}} an effective chain of command, logical military formations and a credible troop roster. Although General Mohamed Gelle Kahiye, the respected former army chief, attempted to instill reforms, he was marginalized and eventually dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army did {{not have}} any {{doctrine}} for jungle warfare prior to 1942. Some lessons were passed on <b>by</b> <b>officers</b> who escaped from Malaya and Singapore, however, and these were incorporated into a training memorandum in May that year. AIF units that returned from North Africa undertook some training in jungle tactics before going into action, but the Militia units which initially faced the Japanese in New Guinea suffered from inadequate training, and this led to them suffering heavy casualties.|$|E

5|$|The first {{gendarmerie}} members {{arrived in}} Albania on November 10, 1913. They were soon {{faced with a}} peasant revolt. One International Gendarmerie officer was killed and many were imprisoned after the revolt erupted in June 1914. Dutch officers were gradually replaced <b>by</b> <b>officers</b> from Austria-Hungary and Germany, who arrived in Durrës on July 4. Soon, World War I broke out and by August 4, most of the Dutch officers {{had returned to the}} Netherlands. By September 19, 1914, the last two imprisoned officers were released.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the Indian Ocean, the convoy sailed south-east. The ships manoeuvred {{together in a}} zigzag course; avoiding collisions during the frequent turns placed heavy demands on the watch-keeping officers, who found their shifts exhausting. The troops endured very uncomfortable conditions on the hot and crowded ships, but morale was high. They entertained themselves with sports, sun baking and gambling, and those on Queen Mary could attend concerts performed by a regimental brass band. The 9th Division's officers enjoyed somewhat better conditions, which frustrated {{some of the other}} ranks. The 9th Division's preparations for jungle warfare continued during the voyage, with all personnel attending daily lectures delivered <b>by</b> <b>officers</b> on the lessons learnt during the previous fighting in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Around 1845, Rosas {{managed to}} {{establish}} absolute dominance over the region. He exercised complete control over {{all aspects of}} society with the solid backing of the army. Rosas was raised from colonel to brigadier general (the highest army rank) on 18 December 1829. On 12 November 1840 he declined the newly created and higher rank of grand marshal (gran mariscal), which had been bestowed on him by the House of Representatives. The army was led <b>by</b> <b>officers</b> who had backgrounds and values similar to his. Confident of his power, Rosas made some concessions by returning confiscated properties to their owners, disbanding the Mazorca and ending torture and political assassinations. The inhabitants of Buenos Aires still dressed and behaved according to the set of rules Rosas had imposed, but the climate of constant and widespread fear greatly diminished.|$|E

5|$|Horses {{first arrived}} on the {{southeast}} North American mainland in 1521, brought by Ponce de Leon on his second trip to the region, where they were used <b>by</b> <b>officers,</b> scouts and livestock herders. Later expeditions brought more horses and cattle to Spanish Florida. By the late 16th century, horses were used extensively in the local cattle business and by the late 17th century the industry was flourishing, especially {{in what is now}} northern Florida and southern Georgia. The horses brought to North America by the Spanish and subsequently bred there included Barbs, Garranos, Spanish Jennets, Sorraias, Andalusians and other Iberian breeds. Overall, they were relatively small and had physical traits distinctive of Spanish breeds, including short backs, sloping shoulders, low set tails and wide foreheads.|$|E
5|$|In late 1968, {{the members}} of the Jimi Hendrix Experience were living in a rented house in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles. One night bassist Noel Redding was warned about a pending visit from law enforcement, so he {{immediately}} phoned drummer Mitch Mitchell, who was at the nightclub Whisky a Go Go, and asked him to come over to the house so that they could search for and remove any illegal drugs. They found a large assortment of substances in Hendrix's room that had apparently been given to him by fans. Soon afterwards, they were paid a visit by three detectives who told them that they were under police surveillance <b>by</b> <b>officers</b> living in a nearby house.|$|E
5|$|Intensification of {{the killing}} {{operations}} took place in late 1941 when the SS began construction of stationary gassing facilities to replace the use of Einsatzgruppen for mass killings.

During Operation Reinhard, run <b>by</b> <b>officers</b> from the Totenkopfverbände, who were sworn to secrecy, three death camps were built in occupied Poland: Bełżec (operational by March 1942), Sobibór (operational by May 1942), and Treblinka (operational by July 1942), with squads of Trawniki men (Eastern European collaborators) overseeing hundreds of Sonderkommando prisoners, who were forced to work in the gas chambers and crematoria before being murdered themselves. On Himmler's orders, by early 1942 the concentration camp at Auschwitz was greatly expanded to include the addition of gas chambers, where victims were killed using the pesticide Zyklon B.|$|E
