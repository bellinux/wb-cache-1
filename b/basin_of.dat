In this paper, we investigate {{the possibility that the}} <b>basins</b> <b>of</b> attraction for best response learning and replicator dynamics have vanishing overlap, and thus that the learning models select different equilibria with probability one. In two-by-two games, we show that <b>basins</b> <b>of</b> attrac-tion are invariant {{to a wide range of}} learning rules including best response dynamics, replicator dynamics, and fictitious play. However, we find that we can construct three-by-three symmetric games for which the overlap in the <b>basins</b> <b>of</b> attraction is arbitrarily small. We also show that for any game in which these learning models have <b>basins</b> <b>of</b> attraction with vanishing overlap, then with probability one, the initial best response is not an equilibrium...|$|R

5|$|During the Kimmeridgian, Europe {{was covered}} by the shallow inland Tethys Ocean, with exposed landmasses being a series of {{scattered}} archipelagos. Highly variable sea levels supported a highly diverse insular crocodilian fauna, with biodiversity (that of atoposaurids in particular) being driven strongly by allopatric speciation. The two species of Knoetschkesuchus were part of similar faunas, in both of which they functioned as small predators ecologically partitioned from the other contemporary crocodilians; {{it is likely that}} these faunas originated through dispersal over larger landmasses. A similar faunal exchange occurred with the Wessex-Weald <b>Basin</b> <b>of</b> England.|$|E

An activity control is requisite for the stable retrieval of sparse patterns. We investigate a storage capacity and the <b>basins</b> <b>of</b> attraction. Consequently, the <b>basins</b> <b>of</b> attraction are enlarged while the storage capacity does not change. Thus, the synapticdepression might incorporate the activity control mechanism...|$|R

In symmetric two-by-two games, <b>basins</b> <b>of</b> attraction are invariant {{to a wide range}} of learning rules includ-ing best response dynamics, replicator dynamics, and fictitious play. In this paper, we construct a class of three-by-three symmetric games for which the overlap in the <b>basins</b> <b>of</b> attraction under best response learning and replicator dynamics is arbitrar-ily small. We then derive necessary and sufficient conditions on payoffs for these two learning rules to create <b>basins</b> <b>of</b> attraction with vanishing overlap. The necessary condition requires that pure, uniformly evolutionarily stable strategies are almost never initial best responses. The existence of parasitic or misleading actions allows subtle differences in the learning rules to accumulate...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} planar {{circular}} restricted three-body problem {{where one of the}} primary bodies is an oblate spheroid or an emitter of radiation {{in order to determine the}} <b>basins</b> <b>of</b> attraction associated with the equilibrium points. The evolution of the position of the five Lagrange points is monitored when the values of the mass ratio μ, the oblateness coefficient A_ 1, and the radiation pressure factor q vary in predefined intervals. The regions on the configuration (x,y) plane occupied by the <b>basins</b> <b>of</b> attraction are revealed using the multivariate version of the Newton-Raphson method. The correlations between the <b>basins</b> <b>of</b> convergence of the equilibrium points and the corresponding number of iterations needed in order to obtain the desired accuracy are also illustrated. We conduct a thorough and systematic numerical investigation demonstrating how the dynamical quantities μ, A_ 1, and q influence the <b>basins</b> <b>of</b> attractions. Our results suggest that the mass ratio and the radiation pressure factor are the most influential parameters, while on the other hand the structure <b>of</b> the <b>basins</b> <b>of</b> convergence are much less affected by the oblateness coefficient.
