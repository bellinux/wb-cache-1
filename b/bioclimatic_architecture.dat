This paper presents a group of passive design strategies for <b>bioclimatic</b> landscape <b>architecture</b> in the desert. In this study, a bioclimatic landscape design strategy is proposed that consists of a three layers approach; (1) bioclimatic-zones concept, (2) thematic walled gardens concept, (3) extensive and intensive landscape concept. The passive design strategies should start at early design stage of the master plan creation. This study demonstrates that the three layers approach could be very efficient in order to enhance the microclimate passively with low energy and low water consumption rates. The three established strategies in the design stage have been tested and evaluated for a campus design in Egypt’s hot arid desert. Some quantitative calculations and measurements together with shading analysis have been taken in order to verify these design strategies using the PET index.

In this study, we analyze the energy and microclimatic performance of hypogeous structures in three states: not-restored, immediately after restoration, {{and a few years}} after restoration (in normal use). We monitored a surface hypogeum and a deep hypogeum. We performed a dynamic parametric simulation using the software EnergyPlus to quantify the energetic balance of the hypogeous structures during one calendar year. The energetic valuation of the surface hypogea shows that these environments, once restored and in a condition of normal use, give indoor comfort within the limits of comfort thermo-hygrometrics established by the comfort indices of predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD). The huge thermal mass of the walls ensures that the microclimate indoor conditions are regular throughout the seasons, without differences in the daily thermal oscillation. Deep hypogea without an air change system cannot reach thermal-hygrometric comfort values. We determined that these structures have a null thermal balance during mid-season, while in the summer the floor loses heat, thereby cooling the environment. The opposite occurs in winter.

These include surveys, interviews, observational techniques, architectural modelling, computer simulation and physical measurements. These methods are all illustrated using a Libyan case study {{as an example of}} <b>bioclimatic</b> desert <b>architecture.</b> Energy usage in domestic buildings is responsible for approximately 31 % of the total energy consumption in Libya, with the provision of comfortable space conditions forming the major part of this consumption. Contemporary buildings in Ghadames, Libya adopt air-conditioning systems, which have been recognised as energy-intensive solutions in hot climates. In addition, traditional buildings embrace sustainable features and employ natural ventilation systems to minimise energy consumption. The proposed methodology allows contextualising technical work on thermal comfort, architectural modelling and computer simulation under hot climatic and distinctive sociocultural conditions. It also reviews the results from field surveys undertaken in 2013 and 2014. It shows how 100 residents of Ghadames responded to the environmental conditions and personal well-being, and how such data, together with objective surveys, interviews and observation, can inform architectural modelling, giving a full understanding of the building’s dynamics, explaining the compactness of traditional houses’ urban morphologies, and demonstrating the sociocultural and environmental aspects of the design. These buildings are then tested using computer simulation with EnergyPlus to evaluate the environmental performance and show good agreement with the actual measurements.

40|$|International audienceThe early {{scientific}} researches {{into the}} thermo-regulative {{response of the}} human body during the 1920 s and the 1930 s normalized thermal condi- tions in working and educational environments to improve user’s perfor- mance. The European and American contexts of housing promotion and industrial development during post-war extended this approach to different environments. Geographers, physiologists and engineers encouraged manufactured in- door atmospheres that could overcome human shortcomings resulting from environmental and biological conditions. Climate, indoor atmospheres and human body were interlinked to develop the ideal environment for mod- ern society. Paradoxically, these original notions and researches have been used to promote both <b>bioclimatic</b> and weatherized <b>architectures</b> along {{the second half of the}} twentieth century. The French engineer, researcher and industrialist André Missenard was a prominent contributor to the study on the thermo-physiology of comfort as well as its experimental application to engineering and architecture. As a collaborator of the architect Le Corbusier, his influence not only attempt- ed technical fields, but to the whole notion of the ideal environment for modern society.

Other studies have shown that this kind of architecture was able to respond to winter and summer climate requirements, but especially in the summer period, in coherence with the lifestyle of residents. Several study models concerning the thermal behavior of buildings are found in the literature. These models use software for simulating stationary regime or transient.

The average seasonal temperature is 4 _C in winter and 32 _C in summer, which often has high values close to 40 _C. Moreover winter is mild with rare frosts. Rains are mostly concentrated in autumn and winter. Within this immense artistic heritage, the study regars hypogea habitations and stone buildings (half-hypogeum and half-built), throught monitoring a surface hypogeum and a deep hypogeum. The research focus upon {{the evaluation of the}} energy and microclimatic performance of recovered hypogeous structures today used as a thermal centre (SPA). The analysis performed a dynamic parametric simulation using the software EnergyPlus to quantify the energetic balance of the hypogeous structures during one calendar year. The energetic valuation of the surface hypogea shows that these environments, once restored and in a condition of normal use, give indoor comfort within the limits of comfort thermo-hygrometrics. The methodology used in the research is that of empirical research, i. e. a direct study “in situ”, where the designer is an experimenter and a researcher at the same time. This methodological approach was used on particularly representative case studies: “Locanda di San Martino” thermal centre (SPA). The huge thermal mass of the walls ensures that the microclimate indoor conditions are regular throughout the seasons, without differences in the daily thermal oscillation. Deep hypogea with an air change system cannot reach thermal-hygrometric comfort values. The most important {{thing to do is to}} regulate indoor microclimate, before eliminating the humidity from the walls. The same environments used under normal conditions reach indoor comfort.

Deep hypogeous architectures without an air change system cannot reach thermal-hygrometric comfort values. This system is useful in increasing the indoor temperature and reducing the indoor–outdoor thermal gradient. A dynamic analysis permitted us to quantify the energy balance of the hypogeous structures during a period of one calendar year. In this way, we can state that these structures have a null thermal balance during mid-season, while in summer the floor loses heat and cools the room with the opposite occurring in winter.

This search has yielded new terminology to indicate sustainable ways of transforming the anthropic environment: zero-energy development, <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>architecture,</b> eco-buildings and low carbon footprint. Apparently, this new linguistic phenomenon is symptomatic of two trends: firstly, of a sort of amnesia, in the sense that traditional architecture was already sustainable, not out of choice, but out of survival needs (via its ties to local climate and materials); and secondly, of an identity crisis among designers caused by the difficulty in finding specific boundaries for the discipline of architecture and urban design. Reflecting on these aspects and through the description of two recent projects, this article addresses the renewed interest in re-establishing an inseparable relationship between natural and anthropic processes. The goal is to elucidate a localized form of sustainability by recovering and upgrading traditional knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Fundamentals of vernacular {{architecture}} {{have been used}} in <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>architecture</b> which has gradually become the inspiration of various movements in contemporary architecture. The study points out that the development of bioclimatism in architecture has followed the pattern of a natural evolutionary process in which “natural selection” is likely motivated by several factors, including resources and environment problems, and driven by different mechanisms including novel building design concepts and methods, new standards and codes, discoveries in building science and construction costs. This study is an effort aimed to clarify the evolution process of the bioclimatic approach in architecture over time and its influences on contemporary movements in architecture. The paper shows also that the evolutionary theory generated new scientific tools able to improve building design thanks to simulation-based optimization methods applied to building performances. Finally, this study investigates new motivations in the era of climate change whose effects are expected to introduce more challenges as well as more trends towards a sustainable built environment through the new concept of Eco-adaptive architecture.

40|$|In this paper, {{bioclimatic}} design {{strategies in}} Moroccan architecture have been analyzed {{for the city}} of Casablanca. The aim {{of this study is to}} enable architects to re-understand the lessons of tradition, because the way towards <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>architecture</b> should start by understanding vernacular architecture. The first part of the paper presents climate analysis and a set of bioclimatic principles addressing orientation, shading, thermal mass, insulation and natural ventilation as a mean for passive cooling. The second part explores the potential of implementing the Passivhaus Standard in Casablanca. Based on a validated building model, the performance of one of an apartment, satisfying the Passivhaus Standard has been determined by means of building performance simulation. The analysis evaluated different bioclimatic strategies and examined the transfer of the Passivhaus concept to hot warm climate, while ensuring thermal comfort during summer. Results showed that the studied building concept, comprising several bioclimatic design strategies can be transferred, with appropriate adaptations, also to hot climates. Finally the study developed significant recommendation that support architects with principles and strategies for bioclimatic design. Peer reviewe...|$|E
