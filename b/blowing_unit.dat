Michelin radial tires were standard equipment (a first for an American car), and a locking steering column/ignition switch replaced the dash-mounted switch per federal mandate. The metal horn ring used in '69 was deleted from the steering wheel, {{replaced by a}} Rim <b>Blow</b> <b>unit.</b> Increasingly stringent Federal safety requirements mandated the addition of red reflectors to the rear bumper, and yellow reflectors {{to the sides of}} the front parking lamp assemblies.

30|$|The {{authors of}} the work also contributed to studies {{investigating}} the fire retardant properties of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from herring sperm on cotton fabrics (Alongi et al. 2013). Results showed that the cotton was self-extinguishing when 10 % DNA was used, and it was resistant to a flame heat flux of 35  kW m- 2 when 19 % DNA was used. The efficiency was attributed to the intumescent mechanism exhibited by the combination of phosphorus (acid producer), deoxyribose <b>units</b> (<b>blowing</b> agent) and nitrogen-containing bases (releasing ammonia). The unlikely feasibility of this for wood on a commercial scale, however, is recognised.|$|R

Depending on requirements, either a reactive or inert gas or both in conjunction is supplied through one or more of such injectors, The present study suggests that at any given gas injection rate, orientation of side tuyeres together with their numbers can significantly influence the nature and intensity of bath agitation. Through an exploratory physical model study, it is demonstrated that by marginally re-orienting a pair of otherwise orthogonal horizontal tuyeres (i. e. entering at an angle of 10 - 15 as opposed to the conventional, perpendicular to the reactor wall), a strong swirling motion could be imparted to the bath. Such rotational motion aided by the prevalent three dimensional flow was found to increase heat and mass transfer rates in the system by 25 - 30 %...|$|R

After a five-day battle, the TPLF captured their mountain stronghold, and the bulk of the defeated EPRP fled to sanctuary with the ELF.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a tangential slot blowing concept for generating lateral control forces on an aircraft forebody is analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. The flow about a fighter forebody is computed using a multiple-zone, thin-layer Navier-Stokes code. Tangential slot blowing is modeled {{by the use of}} an actuator plane. The effects of slot location and slot length on the efficiency of the system are analyzed. Results of the study indicate that placement of the slot near the nose of the aircraft greatly enhances the efficiency of the system, while the length and circumferential location of the slot are of secondary importance. Efficiency is defined by the amount of side force or yawing moment obtained per <b>unit</b> <b>blowing</b> coefficient. The effect of sideslip on the system is also analyzed. The system is able to generate incremental changes in forces and moments in flows with sideslip angles up to 10 deg comparable to those obtained at zero sideslip.
