50|$|Zhan Zhuang has {{a strong}} {{connection}} with Traditional Chinese Medicine. Some schools use the practice {{as a way of}} removing blockages in Qi flow. This <b>blockage</b> <b>removal</b> occurs because Zhan zhuang, when correctly practiced, has a normalizing effect on the body. Any habitual tension or tissue shortening (or lengthening) is normalized by the practice, and the body regains its natural ability to function optimally. It is thought that a normalized body will be less prone to muscular-skeletal medical conditions, and it is also believed that Zhan zhuang, when practiced for developing relaxed postures, will lead to a beneficial calming effect. The Dan Tian is also involved in the practice of Zhan zhuang.|$|E
40|$|When coal bed methane (CBM) {{drainage}} boreholes cross fractured, soft, or water-swelling strata, they {{collapse and}} block frequently. Borehole blockages {{result in a}} rapid decrease in CBM extraction ability, {{which leads to a}} reduction in CBM output and threatens coal mine safety production. To solve these problems, a novel method that uses a self-propelled water-jet nozzle to dredge blocked boreholes in coal seams has been proposed {{on the basis of the}} existing technology. Based on a theoretical analysis of the reason for borehole caving and the theory of <b>blockage</b> <b>removal,</b> we optimized the nozzle inlet pressure and selected an appropriate high-pressure resin pipe. A field experiment on the <b>blockage</b> <b>removal</b> of blocked CBM drainage boreholes using the proposed method was run in the Fengchun coal mine, Qijiang, Chongqing, southwest China. In this field trial, the time spent to unblock a borehole varied between 18. 52 and 34. 98 min, which is much shorter than using a drilling rig. After <b>blockage</b> <b>removal,</b> the average pure volume of the methane drainage of a single borehole was increased from 0. 03 L/min to ~ 1. 91 – 7. 30 L/min, and the methane drainage concentration of a single borehole increased from 5 % to ~ 44 %– 85 %. The extraction effect increased significantly...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{research}} was to improve the accuracy and robustness of pipeline transient modeling. An algorithm was developed to model the transient flow in closed tubes for thin walled pipelines. Emphasis was given to the application of this type of flow to pipelines with small radius 90 ° elbows. An additional loss term was developed to account for the presence of 90 ° elbows in a pipeline. The algorithm was integrated into an optimization routine to fit results from the improved model to experimental data. A web based interface was developed to facilitate the pre- and post- processing operations. Results showed that including a loss term that represents the effects of 90 ° elbows in the Method of Characteristics (MOC) [1] improves the accuracy of the predicted transients by an order of magnitude.

40|$|AbstractThe Longwangmiao Fm group gas {{reservoirs}} in the Moxi {{structure in}} central Sichuan Basin feature high temperature, high pressure and high H 2 S content. The thickness of such high permeable reservoirs with great homogeneity is a geologic {{basis for a}} high-productivity gas well, and good match of natural fractures and vugs is the key factor to high well productivity. Overbalance drilling is likely to cause the opening-up of natural fractures, which {{will lead to the}} leakage of drilling fluid and severe damage to the reservoir. Experimental evaluation results show that the damage rate of the drilling fluid to the rock sample is between 82. 2 % and 89. 2 %, which severely restricts the productivity of gas wells. Therefore, it is necessary to deepen the experimental evaluation technologies and methods to promote the design pertinence of technical parameters. The study shows: first, the optimized gelling acid and steering acid are effective in slowing down speed and removing blockage, forming acidizing wormholes and effectively eliminating the blockage effect caused by drilling liquid pollution; second, the self-developed fiber steering agent and soluble temporary blocking ball can divert the acid, increasing the processing pressure at the well bottom by 5 – 15  MPa, realizing the even stimulation of heterogeneous reservoirs; third, based on experimental evaluation such as the acid penetration and acid rock reaction, it is recommended that the pumping rate be 3. 0 – 3. 5  m 3 /min in acidizing treatment and the acid intensity for <b>blockage</b> <b>removal</b> be 3. 0 – 5. 0  m 3 /m; fourth, the established <b>blockage</b> <b>removal</b> and steering acidizing technology have been applied in more than 20 wells with a remarkable productivity-increase effect, which gives full play to the natural productivity of gas wells and decreases the acid application scale. All these technologies and measures effectively enhance the development quality and profit of the gas reservoir...|$|E
30|$|The {{formation}} damage {{type and}} degree should be diagnosed prior to <b>blockage</b> <b>removal</b> {{so that the}} proposal for acidizing can be optimized accordingly. In the traditional method, the diagnosis is carried out by a field test at the well. The damage degree is then evaluated {{based on the results}} from the pressure test. However, this method is not sufficient to tell the damage radius, degree, and impact of each cause (Xiong and Holditch 1995; Xiong et al. 2001). Since these factors determine acidizing parameters such as acid fluid concentration, formula, and applicable range, the developed system adopts a quantitative method to simulate the permeability and damage radius via modeling, which greatly accelerates the precise diagnosis process and provides reliable support to the design of acidizing. In addition, the effect of each damage cause can be separately investigated. Figure  5 summarizes the analysis flow for a quantitative diagnosis process.|$|E
40|$|Glutamate {{is known}} to {{play a crucial role}} in the {{topographic}} reorganization of visual cortex after the induction of binocular central retinal lesions. In this study we investigated the possible involvement of the glial high-affinity Na+/K+-dependent glutamate transporters in cortical plasticity using western blotting and intracortical microdialysis. Basal extracellular glutamate levels and the re-uptake activity for glutamate have been determined by comparing the extracellular glutamate concentration before and during the <b>blockage</b> of glutamate <b>removal</b> from the synaptic cleft with the potent transporter inhibitor l-trans -pyrrolidine- 3, 4 -dicarboxylic acid. In cats with central retinal lesions we observed increased basal extracellular glutamate concentrations together with a decreased re-uptake activity in non-deprived, peripheral area 17, compared with the sensory-deprived, central cortex of the same animal as well as the topographically matching regions of area 17 in normal subjects. Western blotting experiments revealed a parallel decrease in the expression level of the glial glutamate transporter proteins GLT- 1 and GLAST in non-deprived cortex compared with sensory-deprived cortex of lesion cats and the corresponding regions of area 17 of normal subjects. This study shows that partial sensory deprivation of the visual cortex affects the removal of glutamate from the synaptic cleft and implicates a role for glial-neuronal interactions in adult brain plasticity. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Speed and {{selectivity}} of hepatocyte {{invasion by}} malaria sporozoites have suggested a receptormediated mechanism {{and the specific}} interaction of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein with liver-specific heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) has been implicated in the targeting to the liver. Here we show that the CS protein interacts not only with cell surface heparan sulfate, {{but also with the}} low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). Binding of 125 I-CS protein to purified LRP occurs with a K d of 4. 9 nM and can be inhibited by the receptor-associated protein (RAP). Blockage of L 1 KP by RAP or anti-L 1 KP antibodies on heparan sulfate-deficient CliO cells results in more than 90 % inhibition of binding and endocytosis of recombinant CS protein. Conversely, <b>blockage</b> or enzymatic <b>removal</b> of the cell surface heparan sulfate from LRP-deficient embryonic mouse fibroblasts yields the same degree of inhibition. Heparinasepretreatment of LRP-deficient fibroblasts or blockage of LRP on heparan sulfate-deficient CHO cells by RAP, lactoferrin, or anti-L 1 LP antibodies reduces Plasmodiurn berghei invasion by 60 - 70 %. Parasite development in heparinase-pretreated HepG 2 cells is inhibited by 65 % when RAP is present during sporozoite invasion. These findings suggest that malaria sporozoites utilize the interaction of the CS protein with HSPGs and L 1 KP as the major mechanism for hos...|$|R
40|$|Certain lowland streams have {{experienced}} prehistorical and historical cycles of aggradation, occlusion, degradation, headward incision, and renewed aggradation. Historical cycles {{appear to be}} related to human activities. A case study is presented of the Yalobusha River in Mississippi with emphasis on the effects of blockage and removal on aquatic habitats and fish. The adjacent Skuna River, which was channelized and unblocked, was used in space for time substitution to infer effects of <b>blockage</b> <b>removal</b> on the Yalobusha. Variables describing physical aquatic habitat and fish were sampled from three groups of river reaches: unblocked channelized, channelized and blocked, and naturally sinuous. Fish collections were used to compute six indicators of ecological integrity. At baseflow, mean water depths were an order of magnitude lower in the unblocked channelized stream than for the others. In-channel aquatic habitat volume per unit valley length was 5, 85, and 283 m 3 :m for the channelized, blocked channelized, and natural reaches, respectively. Mean values for all six ecological indicators were lowest for the channelized group. Species richness was greatest for the channelized blocked reach. The ecological indicators displayed gradients in response to the range of observed physical conditions. Management of corridors susceptible to the cycle described above should involve a blend of measures designed to conserve higher quality habitats.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental approach to design, perform, and evaluate stimulation treatments for SAGD producers completed with slotted liners. Heavy oil production {{from a high}} temperature sandstone reservoir declined due to the blockage of slots in horizontal liners. Blocking materials were mainly presented by silicon-based scales, migrated fines, and numerous iron species. Previously, wells were mainly treated by HCl and a high pH chelating agent. These treatments did not improve the production significantly but corroded liners even more. Three liners were pulled out from the wells. Blocking and scaling materials were collected from the slots and walls of these liners for analysis. The experimental process included static acid solubility tests using 15 wt% HCl at room temperature, SEM, and XRD analysis. Also, it was proved that hydrochloric acid is not an optimal solution for <b>blockage</b> <b>removal</b> in these producers. Additionally, organic solvent preflush {{proved to be an}} effective potential improvement in the treatment design. Oil sand samples were collected from the reservoir. The mineralogy of these samples was analyzed in detail. Organic matter was removed, and the rock samples were separated in sand, silt, and clay fractions. Presence of kaolinite, illite, muscovite, incomplete hydroxide interlayer smectite was proved by XRD, SEM, TEM, FTIR, and AAS. Also, interstratification of mica and kaolinite was observed. These results were used to make a decision concerning the choice of compatible treatment fluid. Seven stimulation treatments were conducted in five different wells using foamed chelating agent (GLDA). Flowback emulsion was separated and prepared for analysis which included ICP and GLDA titration. Additionally, the decomposition of GLDA at reservoir conditions was mimicked using aging cells. Decomposition products were identified using GC-MS and were found to be glutaric and aminodiacetic acids. Possible improvements in the treatment?s program and recommendations were formulated based on the obtained data. For example, the soaking time was reduced from 6 to 4 hours after the first treatment. Production data analysis proved the effectiveness of the treatment design. Overall, it was shown that only a systematic approach could be useful to design a successful treatment and achieve a positive impact...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{development}} of methodologies for the analysis of two important issues in a manufacturing environment: human boredom and machine utilization. In particular, this study proposes a mathematical programming model for job rotation to cope with worker's boredom in a manufacturing cell. One of the important side effects of task rotation is the impact of rotation interval on workers' skill learning and forgetting which may cause productivity losses. For this reason, the proposed model simultaneously incorporates worker's skill and boredom variations. The developed formulation is a mixed integer nonlinear mathematical programming model. A linear version of the model is also presented by assuming that both worker's skill and boredom change linearly over time. Furthermore, given the complexity and uncertainty involving human emotions, a novel approach based on the state-of-the-art Bayesian Networks is also presented to measure and to predict human boredom at work. First, the static Bayesian Network is introduced to capture the static aspect of boredom modeling. The static boredom model is subsequently extended based on dynamic Bayesian Networks to account for temporal aspect of boredom modeling. The dynamic boredom model allows integrating boredom evidences spatially and temporally, thus providing a more robust and accurate boredom inference. The proposed boredom model is validated using case based scenarios. Moreover, a metaheuristic approach based on several well-known search algorithms is also presented to solve the nonlinear version of the job rotation model. The proposed algorithm integrates several ingredients including a simulated annealing module, three types of memory, an evolutionary operator, and a <b>blockage</b> <b>removal</b> feature in a generic framework. The main characteristic of the proposed model is the use of both positive and negative memory to intensify the search around good solutions as well as an evolution-based diversification approach. This generic metaheuristic can be tailored to solve a variety of hard optimization problems. Another important issue in a manufacturing environment is machine utilization which is largely affected by scheduling decisions. Though various scheduling problems have been investigated for several decades, the lack of efficient solution methods is still hindering the machine utilization and hence the manufacturing productivity. For this reason, the two most common scheduling problems, job shop scheduling and flow shop scheduling problems are investigated in this thesis. The proposed new metaheuristic is used to solve the scheduling problems. This study presents a methodology to explicitly deal with human's boredom and skill variations at work. It also introduces a probabilistic model to quantitatively measure and predict human boredom. Finally, it contributes to the development of computational intelligence by introducing a generic framework of a new metaheuristic to solve a class of combinatorial optimization problems...|$|E
