5|$|Nevertheless, in October 2014, Lois Leveen speculated in The Atlantic {{that the}} {{original}} Shakespeare play did not contain a <b>balcony.</b> The word, balcone, {{did not exist in}} the English language until two years after Shakespeare's death. The <b>balcony</b> was certainly used in Thomas Otway's 1679 play, The History and Fall of Caius Marius, which had borrowed much of its story from Romeo and Juliet and placed the two lovers in a <b>balcony</b> reciting a speech similar to that between Romeo and Juliet. Leveen suggested that during the 18th century, David Garrick chose to use a <b>balcony</b> in his adaptation and revival of Romeo and Juliet and modern adaptations have continued this tradition.|$|E

50|$|The main {{features}} of the <b>balconies</b> are the lattice, still and baluster. The wooden <b>balconies</b> projecting at upper levels also allow for privacy and air circulation, an essential feature for buildings in warmer countries. Non-rounded <b>balconies</b> were introduced in Spain in the 18th century. <b>Balconies</b> of the 15th to the 17th century are noted for their openness, while <b>balconies</b> built after that period are more closed. Seville tiles and mosaics {{are used in the}} construction of the <b>balconies.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Balconies</b> The <b>balconies</b> at Dakota Crescent {{are very}} unusual and {{different}} from the modern HDB flats’ <b>balconies</b> - one can easily see many of the <b>balconies</b> at Dakota Crescent having metal grills and brightly painted louvered doors, which are breathable. It is said that the <b>balconies</b> were painted visually different by the residents themselves, who were afraid of getting lost, {{so that they can}} recognize their houses at a glance.|$|R

5|$|Built in 1483, it has {{a square}} base, a {{transitional}} segment leading into an octagonal shaft, then a 10 - sided polygon shaft, followed by a cylindrical shaft that consists of 8 brick pillars, each two adjoined by bricks in between. The Minaret of Qaytbay also has three balconies, supported by muqarnas, a form of stalactite vaulting which provide a smooth transition from a flat surface to a curved one (first recorded to {{have been used in}} Egypt in 1085), that adorn the minaret. The first shaft is octagonal is decorated with keel-arched panels on each side, with a cluster of three columns separating each panel. Above this shaft is the second octagonal shaft which is separated from the first by a <b>balcony</b> and decorated with plaiting. A second <b>balcony</b> separates this shaft with the final cylindrical shaft, decorated with four arches. Above this is the third <b>balcony,</b> crowned by the finial top of the minaret.|$|E

5|$|Jharokha Darshan was a daily {{practice}} {{of addressing the}} public audience (darshan) at the <b>balcony</b> (jharokha) at the forts and palaces of medieval kings in India. It was an essential and direct way of communicating face-to-face with the public, and was a practice which {{was adopted by the}} Mughal emperors. The <b>balcony</b> appearance in the name of Jharokha Darshan also spelled jharokha-i darshan was adopted by the 16th-century Mughal Emperor Akbar, even though it was contrary to Islamic injunctions. Earlier, Akbar's father Emperor Humayun had also adopted this Hindu {{practice of}} appearing before his subjects at the jharokha to hear their public grievances.|$|E

40|$|High-rise {{buildings}} {{can cause}} high wind speed near ground level and on building <b>balconies</b> necessitating remedial action. In {{order to reduce}} wind discomfort on <b>balconies,</b> different measures can be taken. This paper presents the evaluation of a new second-skin facade concept to improve wind comfort at building <b>balconies.</b> The concept consists of a staggered semi-open second-skin facade {{in front of the}} <b>balconies,</b> which partly shields them from the wind. CFD simulations are performed for the building with and without second-skin facade concept. Validation is conducted using wind-tunnel measurements of surface pressure distribution on a building model with <b>balconies.</b> Next, the CFD results are combined with wind speed statistics and a comfort criterion to judge wind comfort on the <b>balconies,</b> according to the Dutch wind nuisance standard. The analysis shows that this concept is effective in providing a zone with pressure equalisation at the <b>balconies.</b> The related reduction in pressure gradients across the width of the facade strongly decreases the local wind speed. At many positions along the <b>balconies</b> this yields a wind comfort improvement of one or even two classes in the Dutch wind nuisance standard compared to the situation without implementation of this concept...|$|R
5|$|No {{criminal}} {{charges were filed}} and Pappas was fined a total of $108,000 {{as a result of}} the collapse. Twenty-seven families sued Pappas and the city over the accident. The <b>balcony</b> was rebuilt afterwards, this time with metal.|$|E
5|$|Six partygoers {{simultaneously}} fall to {{the sidewalk}} outside the Rosencrantz apartment building in Brooklyn, apparently having jumped from a seventh floor <b>balcony</b> along with the balcony's furniture. When the Fringe team investigates, Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter (John Noble) determine by {{the location of the}} bodies that they seem to have fallen through the <b>balcony,</b> as if it momentarily ceased to exist. From other stories of strange phenomena occurring throughout the building, Walter concludes that the same cracks in reality that have harmed the parallel universe are starting to appear in the prime one, with the building occupying a weak spot between universes.|$|E

50|$|Historian Charles Walker has {{interpreted}} the <b>balconies</b> as {{a manifestation of}} social power dynamics, as they illustrate the distinction between individuals of different classes.

5|$|The video commences with Swift, clothed {{by a black}} {{sweater and}} jeans, walking through a {{university}} campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and performs in a <b>balcony.</b> After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands in the <b>balcony,</b> looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase. Swift and Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the <b>balcony</b> setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.|$|E

5|$|The Palazzo Zacco {{is one of}} {{the more}} notable Baroque {{buildings}} of the city, its Corinthian columns supporting <b>balconies</b> of amazing wrought iron work, while supports of grotesques mock, shock or amuse the passerby. The palazzo was built in the second half of the 18th century by the Baron Melfi di San Antonio. It was later acquired by the Zacco family, after which it is named. The building has two street façades, each with six wide <b>balconies</b> bearing the coat of arms of the Melfi family, a frame of acanthus leaves from which a puttino leans. The <b>balconies,</b> a feature of the palazzo, are notable for the differing corbels which support them, ranging from putti to musicians and grotesques.

Here the <b>balconies</b> are supported by images of musicians with grotesque faces.|$|R
