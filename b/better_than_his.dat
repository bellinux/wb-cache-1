5|$|Whale {{returned}} to Broadway in 1944 {{to direct the}} psychological thriller Hand in Glove. It was his first return to Broadway since his failed One, Two, Three! in 1930. Hand in Glove would fare no <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> earlier play, running {{the same number of}} performances, 40.|$|E
5|$|Metacritic later {{noted that}} Ebert tended {{to give more}} lenient ratings than most critics. His average film rating was 71% if {{translated}} into a percentage, compared to 59% for the site as a whole. 75% of his reviews were positive and 75% of his ratings were <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> colleagues. Although Ebert rarely wrote outright scathing reviews, he {{had a reputation for}} writing memorable ones for the films he really disliked, such as North.|$|E
5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> statistics would suggest. He {{was capable of}} batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E

5|$|Bose {{commented that}} Ganguly's {{greatest}} legacy {{lay in his}} influence on the younger and budding generation of cricketers. Ganguly felt that every young player should play two years of domestic cricket before being selected for international assignments. He also said that every newcomer should be given at least five games to prove himself. Later he explained that being at {{the receiving end of}} an unfair decision against him, that threatened to ruin his international cricket career, it enabled him to understand the insecurities of other newcomers in the team <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> predecessors. Ganguly had always backed the influence and contribution of younger players of the team.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} his two-year-old {{season with a}} record of five wins and a second place from six starts. At the end of the season, some even believed that he was <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> sire Ormonde, the 'horse of the century'. One writer rated him ten pounds superior to the next best two-year-old La Fleche, with her being one pound superior to Flyaway. Some were more cautious, however, suggesting that Orme had not beaten any top horses.|$|E
5|$|His Teutonic Knights {{returned}} to Poland's history. Describing the Battle of Grunwald (1410), a Polish-Lithuanian {{victory over the}} Germans in the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War, the book had a substantial contemporary political context in the ongoing Germanization efforts (Kulturkampf) in German Poland. The book quickly became another Sienkiewicz bestseller in Poland, and was received by critics <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> Trilogy had been; it was also applauded by the Polish right-wing, anti-German National Democracy political movement, and {{became part of the}} Polish school curriculum after Poland regained independence in 1918.|$|E
6000|$|... "No man {{knows the}} path of honour <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Major Falconer," [...] said Sir Philip. [...] "An aspirant after fame, like me, cannot choose a <b>better</b> guide <b>than</b> <b>his</b> footsteps." ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the third}} stage, the Tour {{returned}} to France; at the border, the riders were stopped by two French customs {{officers and the}} delay took so long that the stage had to be restarted. During the stage in the Alps, Émile Georget was <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> competitors; he won the stage and became leader of the general classification. Georget won five of the first eight stages, and had a commanding lead. In the seventh stage, Marcel Cadolle, {{at that time in}} second place, fell and his handlebar penetrated his knee, after which he had to give up.|$|E
5|$|Mack 10 left Priority Records after The Paper Route, and {{his next}} album, Bang or Ball (2001), was {{released}} through Cash Money and Universal Records. His album sales continued to decelerate with his 2003 album, Ghetto, Gutter & Gangsta, which was released through Bungalo Records. In 2005, he released Hustla's Handbook under Capitol Records. The album did significantly <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> previous, peaking at number sixty-five on the Billboard 200—forty places above Ghetto, Gutter & Gangsta. His most recent solo album, Soft White (2009), was released through Fontana Distribution and at number 141, {{it is his}} lowest charting album on the Billboard 200.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} of the imperial forces from Sicily resulted in the rapid collapse of the imperial position there. Under Maniakes, the Byzantines had conquered the eastern portion of the island, but by 1042, only Messina remained in Byzantine hands. On the mainland, Boioannes did not fare <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> predecessor, as he was defeated and taken prisoner at the Battle of Montepeloso in September. This succession of defeats signalled {{the beginning of the}} end for Byzantine rule in southern Italy, a process which was completed three decades later with the fall of Bari to the Normans under Robert Guiscard.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{was neither}} aesthetically nor {{technically}} {{among the best}} batsmen, Leyland {{had a reputation for}} batting well under pressure. He performed most effectively against the best teams and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> first-class figures, and against Australia his average is even higher. Outside of Tests, he had some success with the ball, and {{had it not been for}} the depth of spin bowling in Yorkshire, he might have been a leading bowler. He was one of the first to bowl left-arm wrist-spin, and may have invented the name to describe such deliveries—"chinamen". Very popular with team-mates and spectators, Leyland had a reputation as a humorist, and many stories were told about him.|$|E
5|$|Much of Sibelius's reputation, {{during his}} {{lifetime}} and subsequently, derived from {{his work as a}} symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time {{there was no reason to}} suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> Seventh.|$|E
5|$|The family becomes {{increasingly}} frightened and distrustful of him, especially when his latest advice leads Hayley {{to be attacked}} by a shark. With the shark loose in the house, the family fights for survival. Stan loses hope and admits Francine's suggestions are <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> own, until Klaus gives him an encouragement speech which inspires him to prove himself reliable in a crisis once more. Stan obtains a bear from the zoo to battle the shark, which only further aggravates the situation when the two animals work together to kill the family. Refusing to accept Francine's pleas to just get help, Stan instead throws a javelin that hits his wife in her shoulder instead of the bear. Buckle enters {{the house with a}} tranquilizer gun and sedates the two predators before also shooting Stan, who later tells Buckle that he made the right call. Despite the whole ordeal, Stan is no longer convinced that he should stay out of a future crisis.|$|E

25|$|The {{second edition}} of Sweetland {{basketball}} team at Kentucky was {{more successful than}} his first. His second stint as head basketball coach went <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> first. The Wildcats posted an undefeated season {{with a record of}} 9–0.|$|E
50|$|Hall married Jane Catchaside, {{and they}} had a family of 14 children. The {{youngest}} of those, Robert Hall, the younger, was also a Baptist minister, and became <b>better</b> known <b>than</b> <b>his</b> father.|$|R

25|$|Richthofen's early {{victories}} {{and the establishment}} of his reputation coincided with a period of German air superiority, but he achieved many of his successes against a numerically-superior enemy, who flew fighter aircraft that were, on the whole, <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> own.|$|E
25|$|In Aristotelian science, {{especially}} in biology, things {{he saw himself}} have {{stood the test of}} time <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition.
