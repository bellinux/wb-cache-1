5|$|The {{conference at}} Calais was {{something}} of a political triumph, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the French government gave implicit support for Henry's remarriage and Francis I himself held private conference with Anne, the French King maintained alliances with the Pope which he could not explicitly defy.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} a rematch {{of an early}} regular-season contest, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> Georgia Tech won that game, there were {{questions}} about whether the victory would be repeated. Twice before, the two teams matched in the ACC Championship Game had played earlier that season. Both times, the loser of the first matchup won the second. There also were questions about each team's quality because of their losses in rivalry games against Southeastern Conference foes.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} early church {{settlement}} at Llanbadarn Fawr was comparatively successful and well-endowed, {{it is unlikely that}} significant building work was done. The clas church would continue to reflect a strong Celtic form for many years. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> St Augustine, first Archbishop of Canterbury, failed to extend his authority to the Christians in Wales and Dumnonia {{at the beginning of the}} seventh century, the influence of the western church was to begin to be gradually felt. However, even then, the tendency in west Wales was to build larger and larger single cell churches, rather than adopt the newly fashionable basilican design.|$|E

They won $10,000 for UNICEF and attempted to win the $50,000 prize <b>but</b> lost. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> their loss reduced their winnings to $5,000, the group donated an additional $5,000 to UNICEF.|$|R
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1467, there were rumours that Warwick was now {{sympathetic}} to the Lancastrian cause, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> he refused to come to court to answer the charges, the king accepted his denial in writing. In July the same year, {{it was revealed that}} Warwick's deputy in Calais, John, Lord Wenlock, was involved in a Lancastrian conspiracy, and early in 1469 another Lancastrian plot was uncovered, involving John de Vere, Earl of Oxford. It was becoming clear that the discontent with Edward's reign was widespread, a fact that Warwick could exploit.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} what human organs are {{affected}} by interaction with promethium; a possible candidate is the bone tissues. Sealed promethium-147 is not dangerous. However, if the packaging is damaged, then promethium becomes dangerous {{to the environment and}} humans. If radioactive contamination is found, the contaminated area should be washed with water and soap, <b>but,</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> promethium mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded. If a promethium leak is found, the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated, and emergency services must be contacted. No dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known.|$|E
5|$|The Ottomans met stiff {{resistance}} at Kőszeg. Suleiman {{had hoped}} that the imperial army would come to relieve Kőszeg, affording him {{an opportunity for a}} larger engagement. However, during the Ottoman attacks on Kőszeg, the imperial army still formed up in Regensburg. The Ottomans continued with one attack after another; artillery fire brought down parts of the walls, but brought no surrender. The Ottomans' mines were sapped by countermines. The layout of Kőszeg's walls made mining a feasible strategy, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> several mines succeeded in blowing holes in the fortifications, the defenders held out. For more than twenty-five days, without any artillery, Captain Nikola Jurišić and his garrison of 700 local Hungarian peasants and a few Croat soldier held out against nineteen full-scale assaults and an incessant bombardment by the Ottomans.|$|E
50|$|John {{told his}} little brother that sea otters aren't mammals, <b>but</b> fish, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> John himself was a marine {{biologist}} and knew otherwise. John simply wanted to see {{his little brother}} fail his class report, in order to teach him to begin projects early, which help him develop skills necessary to succeed in life.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, the Rangers did {{not make}} the playoffs <b>but</b> the Capitals, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> they won the President's Trophy, in the conference quarterfinals gave up a 3-1 series lead to the Montreal Canadiens.|$|R
50|$|Hanif's {{style has}} often been {{compared}} with that of author Salman Rushdie. <b>But</b> Hanif disagrees. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> he says that he enjoys reading Rushdie's books, he would not want to suffer the same fate as Rushdie did.|$|R
5|$|The {{composition}} of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical {{to that of the}} base material. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. This is especially true of alloy steels such as HSLA steels. Likewise, electrodes of compositions {{similar to those of the}} base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core materials significantly different from the base material. For example, stainless steel electrodes are sometimes used to weld two pieces of carbon steel, and are often utilized to weld stainless steel workpieces with carbon steel workpieces.|$|E
5|$|The ruling dynasty of Greece (the House of Glücksburg) was of German-Danish origin, and Constantine and Sophia {{were seen}} as far too German by the Venizelists, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the {{marriage}} of the king to a Greek presented an opportunity to Hellenize the royal family, and counter criticisms {{that it was a}} foreign institution, both Venizelists and Constantinists opposed the match. The Venizelists feared it would give Alexander a means to communicate with his exiled family through Colonel Manos and both sides of the political divide were unhappy at the king marrying a commoner. Although Venizelos was a friend of Petros Manos, the prime minister warned the king that marrying her would be unpopular {{in the eyes of the}} people.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} geography, the Royal Navy {{was able to}} use her {{imposing}} battleship and battlecruiser fleet to impose a strict and successful naval blockade of Germany and kept Germany's smaller battleship fleet bottled up in the North Sea: only narrow channels led to the Atlantic Ocean and these were guarded by British forces. Both sides were aware that, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, a full fleet engagement would be likely to result in a British victory. The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on their terms: either to induce a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline, where friendly minefields, torpedo-boats and submarines could be used to even the odds. Germany's submarines were able to break out and raid commerce, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> they sank many merchant ships, they could not successfully blockade Great Britain – in contrast to Britain's successful battleship blockade of Germany, which was a major cause of Germany's economic collapse in 1918. The Royal Navy on the other hand, successfully adopted convoy tactics to combat Germany's submarine blockade and eventually defeated it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{literature}} and cultural studies off late Postmodernism has had domineering and attractive impact during 1960 s and 1990 s. Still, critics {{of art and}} literature articulate on postmodern influences. Modernism {{is said to be}} believed that it has become a byword of demise of its modernity. <b>But</b> then, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> modernism has gone off, the modernity is prevalent in the art and culture...|$|R
5|$|The subpoenas are {{handed out}} in the hearing over Bartlet's {{concealment}} of his multiple sclerosis. The special prosecutor, Clement Rollins (Pryor), appears to be both fair and responsible, but C.J. believes the White House will be better served {{in the public eye}} if investigated by a partisan agent. She therefore decides—against the strong objections of White House counsel Oliver Babish—to present Rollins as an ally of the administration, thereby forcing Congress to take control over the investigation. Meanwhile Donna, unwittingly, becomes entangled in potential problems over the hearings. Ainsley Hayes sets her up on a date with the Republican House Government Oversight Committee counsel Clifford Calley, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the date seems to go well, Calley then leaves her quite abruptly {{in the middle of the}} street. Donna later realizes the reason: his congressional committee is the one that will be in charge of the investigation, and a relationship between the two could constitute a conflict of interest.|$|E

After a mediocre and injury troubled season from there on, Söderling reached the third round in the US Open before going through another surgery.|$|E

25|$|In week 17, the Lions {{defeated}} Green Bay 30–20, intercepting four {{passes from}} quarterback Brett Favre and winning despite playing without their best offensive star, running back Barry Sanders. The win gave them homefield advantage for this game. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> Sanders recovered from his injury {{in time for}} the playoffs, this time the Packers won by overcoming a 17–7 third quarter deficit and pulling ahead on Favre's 40-yard game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Sterling Sharpe with 55 seconds left.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Marshall {{tries to}} get Lily to let Scooter know she {{is never going to}} be with him, but she is immobilized by Scooter's cute puppy-dog eyes. Marshall uses Barney's teacup pig (in a cute blanket) to train Lily to resist Scooter. Eventually, it works, and the two head down to the cafeteria, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> Lily is able to tell Scooter it will never happen, Marshall himself can't resist Scooter's charm, telling him to wait until Marshall is dead.|$|E
25|$|The dissents of Holmes in Schwimmer, Hughes in Macintosh, and Black in In re Summers {{have since}} become the {{majority}} {{view of the}} Supreme Court. Schwimmer and Macintosh were overruled in Girouard v. United States, 328 U.S. 61 (1946). <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the cases which {{formed the basis of}} the decision in In re Summers were disavowed, the Court reaffirmed Summers in 1950 in American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382 (1950). In re Summers became the basis for the Court to uphold a number of loyalty oath cases during the Cold War.|$|E

60|$|Finally, the {{principle}} holds with utmost clearness as it respects clergymen. No goodness of disposition will excuse want {{of science in}} a physician, or of shrewdness in an advocate; <b>but</b> a clergyman, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> his power of intellect be small, is respected on the presumed ground of his unselfishness and serviceableness.|$|R
25|$|The {{information}} {{conveyed by}} a single cone is limited: by itself, the cell cannot tell the brain which wavelength of light caused its excitation. A visual pigment may absorb two wavelengths equally, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> their photons are of different energies, the cone cannot tell them apart, because they both cause the retinal to change shape and thus trigger the same impulse. For the brain to see colour, it must compare the responses {{of two or more}} classes of cones containing different visual pigments, so the four pigments in birds give increased discrimination.|$|E
25|$|In {{autumn of}} 704, there {{began to be}} accusations of {{corruption}} levied against Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, {{as well as their}} brothers Zhang Changqi, Zhang Changyi, and Zhang Tongxiu (張同休). Zhang Tongxiu and Zhang Changyi were demoted, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the officials Li Chengjia (李承嘉) and Huan Yanfan advocated that Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong be removed as well, Wu Zetian, taking the suggestion of the chancellor Yang Zaisi, did not remove them. Subsequently, charges of corruption against Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were renewed by the chancellor Wei Anshi.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the filmmakers}} needed an 18th-century French setting, {{shooting}} {{the film in}} its original setting of Paris was unlikely due to the extensive modernization {{of the city in}} the 19th century. Croatia was initially considered as an alternative because of its earthy scenery and pristine old-world towns, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the price was right, the distance between locations proved to be disadvantageous. In the end, the filmmakers opted to shoot most of the film in Catalonia, Spain which, although more expensive than Croatia, offered locations which were closer to each other.|$|E
