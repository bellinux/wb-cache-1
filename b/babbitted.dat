A rational vibration criterion can {{be based on a}} consistent magnitude of this dynamic load among widely different machines rather than a simple equality of shaft mils of vibration. An analysis and curves are provided for some common types of turbomachinery bearings which can be used to correlate mils of vibration with bearing dynamic load. The analysis shows that the percent of bearing clearance consumed by a vibrating journal, together with its steady load, are two important factors in establishing the dynamic load magnitude. These factors can be used to provide a simple estimate of allowable shaft vibration for a specified dynamic load criterion at acceptable, alarm or trip levels...|$|E
40|$|LectureTilting pad {{bearings}} {{are used}} extensively in high power and/or high speed pump applications. Traditional white metallined {{also known as}} <b>babbitted</b> tilting pad bearings are used for oil lubricated bearings. <b>Babbitted</b> tilting pad bearings are not ideal for applications with low viscous lubricants, like waterbased fluids. For these applications, polymer bearings offer many advantages over traditional bearing materials including: Low friction coefficient, Higher flexibility, Wide range of operational temperature, High corrosion and chemical resistance, High shock and impact resistance, Tolerance against particle contamination, Electrical insulation. To achieve the desired improvement in performance, the material specifics of the polymer have to be carefully considered in the design process. One option available is a polymer lined tilting pad bearing which combines the excellent tribological properties of polymers and the high structural stiffness of the steel back. But a polymer lined metal pad does not provide the same equalizing effect offered by the higher compressibility of a solid polymer pad. For example the problems of an edge carrier can be reduced for a tilting pad journal bearing and the self-equalizing mechanism can be avoided for a {{tilting pad thrust bearing}} while considering the higher flexibility of solid PEEK pads. An additional advantage of a solid polymer pad is the elimination of the bonding between the polymer and the steel, so that a possible source of a bearing failure can be avoided upfront already. During a qualification test of a commercially available solid polymer tilting pad thrust bearing, the high Hertzian contact stress at the pivot let to indentations in the polymer. After a few operating hours these indentations are clearly visible and will finally lead to a complete loss of the advantages of a tilting pad bearing over a fixed geometry bearing. This lecture describes the steps involved in the optimization of the solid polymer tilting pad bearing design, with the objective to increase the reliability of the bearing assembly. The limitations of the available solid polymer tilting pad thrust bearing have been overcome by the integration of a metal reinforced pivot as mentioned by Gassmann et al. (2013). The results of the TEHD analysis presented form the base of the optimized journal and thrust bearing design. The new journal and thrust bearing design has been validated through testing of a prototype. The data collected during tests with the optimized thrust and journal bearings are in excellent agreement with the simulations. With the optimized bearing design, the limitations of the original pad design have been mitigated. The successfully qualified journal and thrust bearing are one of the building blocks required for product lubricated pumps and will be used in subsea pump applications...|$|E

40|$|Case StudyA 2500 HP {{integral}} gear compressor in an {{air separation}} plant experienced an impeller failure {{in the first stage}} of compression. The failure was extensive and took the dry air compressor off-line. Plant production was curtailed for several weeks. Initial investigation focused on the 1 st stage centrifugal compressor impeller and upstream dust filter. Most of the aluminum impeller was missing and portions of the air filter element had melted. With the sequence and cause unclear, a formal root cause analysis (RCA) was undertaken. The RCA process ultimately revealed that an unexpected thermite reaction occurred and consumed most of the aluminum impeller. During compressor shutdown, products of the intensely exothermic thermite reaction backflowed into the upstream dust filter causing the element to partially melt. The thermite reaction initiated in the impeller back disk seal area where metal oxides and fuel (debris) had collected. Viscous heating and temperatures greater than expected allowed the rotating labyrinth seal to creep. Contact with the <b>babbitted</b> stationary seal generated additional heat and further accelerated the creep process. Frictional heating in the impeller back disk seal initiated the reaction. Corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence included a creep resistant impeller back disk seal and a passive debris removal system to prevent debris particles from collecting in the impeller back disk seal area. This compressor and a twin have operating reliably since 2003. Recent inspection revealed neither back disk seal creep no the collection of debris particles. These facts have verified the effectiveness of the solution...|$|E
40|$|Plans to {{shut down}} nuclear power plants in some European {{countries}} as well as increased electricity production by wind and solar power will increase the work load on hydroelectric power plants in the future. Also, due to the power grid regulations, hydroelectric power plants undergo more frequent start-ups and shut-downs. During such transient periods, a large amplitude shaft motion can occur, especially in the power plants with vertical shafts. Large shaft motion is not desirable because {{it can lead to}} a machine failure. Furthermore, performance limitations of conventional white metal or <b>babbitted</b> bearings call for the development of new bearing designs. An outstanding tribological performance can be achieved by introducing compliant polymer liners. At the same time, bearings with compliant liners may alter rotor-bearing system dynamic behaviour compared to the systems with conventional white metal bearings. The research approach of this thesis is to employ nonlinear analysis to provide further understanding of the compliant bearing dynamic response to synchronous shaft excitation. Plain cylindrical journal bearings with different compliant liner thicknesses were analysed using a nonlinear approach. The numerical model was verified with an in-house developed code at steady state conditions. Results obtained by the numerical models showed good agreement. After verification of the numerical model for fixed geometry journal bearings, models for tilting pad journal bearings were developed. Results for the tilting pad journal bearing with three pads with line pivot geometry were compared with published data in dynamic conditions. A good agreement was obtained between the two numerical models. The effect of pad pivot geometry on bearing dynamic response was investigated. Vertical and horizontal shaft configurations were compared in terms of the effect of preload factor, pivot offset, tapers and pad inclination angles. Influence of the viscoelastic properties of compliant liners was also studied. All these factors significantly affect bearing dynamic response. It is shown how these factors should be selected to control the journal orbit sizes. It was also shown that the compliant liner provides lower maximum oil film pressure and thicker minimum oil film thickness in the bearing mid-plane in both static and dynamic operating conditions.
