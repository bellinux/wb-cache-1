60|$|So far of aging; next {{of effects}} {{of light and}} color. It is, I believe, hardly enough {{observed}} among architects that the same decorations are of totally different effect according to their position {{and the time of}} day. A moulding which is of value on a building facing south, where it takes deep shadows from steep sun, may be utterly ineffective if placed west or east; and a moulding which is chaste and intelligible in shade on a north side, may be grotesque, vulgar, or confused when it takes black shadows on the south. Farther, there is a time of day in which every architectural decoration is seen to best advantage, and certain times in which its peculiar force and character are best explained; of these niceties the architect takes little cognizance, as he must in some sort calculate on the effect of ornament at all times; but to the artist they are of infinite importance, and especially for this reason, that there is always much detail on buildings which cannot be drawn as such, which is too far off, or too minute, and which must consequently be set down in short-hand of some kind or another; and, as it were, an abstract, more or less philosophical, made of its general heads. Of the style of this abstract, of the lightness, confusion, and mystery necessary in it, I have spoken elsewhere; at present I insist only on the arrangement and matter of it. All good ornament and all good architecture are capable of being put into short-hand; that is, each has a perfect system of parts, principal and subordinate, of which, even when the complemental details vanish in distance, the system and anatomy yet remain visible so long as anything is visible; so that the divisions of a beautiful spire shall be known as beautiful even till their last line vanishes in blue mist, and the effect of a well-designed moulding shall be visibly disciplined, harmonious, and inventive, {{as long as it is}} seen to be a moulding at all. Now the power of the artist of marking this character depends not on his complete knowledge of the design, but on his experimental knowledge of its salient and <b>bearing</b> <b>parts,</b> and of the effects of light and shadow, by which their saliency is best told. He must therefore be prepared, according to his subject, to use light, steep or level, intense or feeble, and out of the resulting chiaroscuro select those peculiar and hinging points on which the rest are based, and by which all else that is essential may be explained.|$|E

40|$|Summary This thesis evaluates how {{fat body}} mass (FBM) and lean body mass (LBM) {{influence}} bone mineral density (BMD) in total body, weight bearing and non-weight <b>bearing</b> <b>parts</b> of the skeleton. It is a cross-sectional study based on absorptiometry {{data from a}} large population based study (Tromsø V). The project involved an initial quality control of the data, and includes data from 1354 men and women aged 32 - 87 in 2001. The result shows that both FBM and LBM are independent predictors of BMD. One kilogram increase in LMB gives larger increase in BMD than one kilogram increase in FBM. Both have {{a positive influence on}} BMD in weight <b>bearing</b> <b>parts</b> (whole body and hips), whereas for non-weight <b>bearing</b> <b>parts</b> (forearm), only LBM is significant. This may indicate that the mechanical force generated by action of muscles have an additional effect on BMD other than the gravitational force from the body mass itself. The hip fracture incidence in the Norwegian population is {{among the highest in the}} world, and the proportion of elderly people in the population is increasing. Risk of fracture increases with age and it is a clear correlation between BMD and this risk. Improved knowledge of patterns and processes relevant for reducing the incidence rate is therefore important in order to improve public health.

Pulse method is the most widely used method in ultrasonic detection.

These problems limit the ultrasonic detection in many high precision applications. In this paper, the shortcomings of traditional detection methods are studied and make improvement, the method no longer relies on the sound pressure, uses linear FM ultrasonic signal as a transmission signal source, the ultrasonic echo signal coherent processing, so as to get more high detection reliability and accuracy.

40|$|Purpose: In {{paper is}} {{presented}} technology of bimetallic layered castings based on founding method of layer coating directly in cast process so-called method of mould cavity preparation. Design/methodology/approach: Prepared bimetallic layered castings consist two fundamental <b>parts</b> i. e. <b>bearing</b> <b>part</b> and working <b>part</b> (layer). The <b>bearing</b> <b>part</b> of bimetallic layered casting is typical foundry material i. e. pearlitic grey cast iron, whereas working part (layer) is depending on accepted variant plates of alloy steels sort X 6 Cr 13, X 12 Cr 13, X 10 CrNi 18 - 8 and X 2 CrNiMoN 22 - 5 - 3. The ratio of thickness between <b>bearing</b> and working <b>part</b> is 8 : 1. The verification of the bimetallic layered castings was evaluated {{on the basis}} of ultrasonic NDT (non-destructive testing), structure and macro- and microhardness researches. Moreover was made computer simulation of solidification of bimetallic layered casting in NovaFlow&Solid software. Findings: The results of studies and their analysis show efficiency of new, innovative technology of corrosion and heat resisting layered castings. Research limitations: In further research, authors of this paper are going to application of different material on <b>bearing</b> <b>part</b> of bimetallic layered casting.

40|$|Rolling {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used in aeroengine, machine tool spindles, locomotive wheelset, and so forth. Rolling bearings are usually the weakest components that influence the remaining life of the whole machine. In this paper, a fatigue life prediction method is proposed based on quasistatic modeling of rolling bearings. With consideration of radial centrifugal expansion and thermal deformations on the geometric displacement in the bearings, the Jones’ bearing model is updated, which can predict the contact angle, deformation, and load between rolling elements and bearing raceways more accurately. Based on Hertz contact theory and contact mechanics, the contact stress field between rolling elements and raceways is calculated. A coupling model of fatigue life and damage for rolling bearings is given and verified through accelerated life test. Afterwards, the variation of bearing life is investigated under different working conditions, that is, axial load, radial load, and rotational speed. The results suggested that the working condition had a great influence on fatigue life of <b>bearing</b> <b>parts</b> and {{the order in which}} the damage appears on <b>bearing</b> <b>parts...</b>|$|E
