30|$|Being biosolvent, ethanol {{has been}} safely used in perfumes, make-up products, wine and liquor (Buchanan et al. 1988; Scherger et al. 1988). Thus, {{it can be}} a better {{alternative}} as a solvent for Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). Acetone is naturally found in trees, plants and as a by-product of the breakdown of body fat showing low toxicity (Macdonald and Fall 1993). Ethylene glycol can be produced using renewable biomass (cellulose and polyols) which could be a burgeoning area for future research due to its environmental friendliness and long-term economical advantages (Zhao et al. 2013). It is a simple diol containing two hydroxyl groups in adjacent positions along a hydrocarbon chain, non-volatile and completely miscible with most of the polar solvents and slightly soluble with some non polar solvents showing low toxicity. Being an excellent solvent, its several attractive applications in various chemical fields such as plasticizers, elastomers, corrosion inhibitors, detergents for equipment cleaning and inks for <b>ball</b> <b>point</b> <b>pens,</b> etc. Considering low toxicity, we have used these solvents for achieving separations of amino acids.|$|R

His works were often double-sided and when he signed pieces, he would add [...] "Prophet" [...] to the front of his name, or alternatively [...] "Patriarch".|$|R
