This thesis proposes a new buffer insertion algorithm for large circuits.

The algorithm iteratively inserts buffers in the circuit improving the circuit delay step by step. At the core of this algorithm are very simple but extremely effective techniques that constructively guide the search for a good <b>buffering</b> <b>solution.</b> A flexibility to adapt to the user's requirements and the ability to reduce the number of buffers are the strengths of this algorithm.

40|$|Heterogeneous Fenton-like {{catalysts}} {{have received}} considerable research attention {{because they could}} potentially be attractive for oxidative removal of organic contaminants from tertiary wastewater. However, process design is still hampered by insufficient understanding of the chemical pathways involved, and especially whether oxidation activity stems from heterogeneous surface chemistry or minute concentrations of dissolved metal ions in the homogeneous phase. Using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) in combination with pH monitoring and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–vis) we have monitored the degradation of 4 -chlorophenol (4 -CP) over two Fenton-like heterogeneous systems, namely FeOx supported on TiO 2 and CuFe 2 O 4. We show conclusively that these systems proceed predominantly through a homogeneous route via dissolved metal ions from the solid phase catalysts. Control experiments with homogeneous Fe 3 + or Cu 2 + systems reveal that even minute concentrations (μM/subppm) of dissolved metal ions leached from the solid phases account for the observed 4 -CP degradation rates in the heterogeneous systems. ICP-OES revealed that metal leaching was time-dependent and variable because of pH variations associated with changing acid release rates. <b>Buffering</b> <b>solutions</b> at pH 7. 4 suppressed metal leaching (and hence 4 -CP degradation) in the FeOx/TiO 2 system, but not in others. For example, pH buffering did not entirely suppress metal leaching from CuFe 2 O 4, for which 4 -CP degradation was retained through small concentrations of Fe and Cu ions in solution. Our results highlight the importance of careful monitoring of metal content in the aqueous phase, certainly with analytical sensitivity below ppm concentrations of the dissolved metals, and also the crucial influence of time-dependent pH variations on the reaction process. Recyclability of catalysts, pH <b>buffering</b> of <b>solutions</b> or monitoring of metal content in the solid phase by less sensitive analytical methods, for example, chemical analysis, gravimetry, X-ray fluorescence, or energy dispersive X-ray analysis in electron microscopes, cannot exclude the homogeneous Fenton route {{in the presence of}} solid catalysts...|$|R
