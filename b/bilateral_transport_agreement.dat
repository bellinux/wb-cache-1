40|$|The primary {{intention}} {{of this research}} is to elaborate guidelines for <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreements</b> which can be entered into by Macau, a Chinese territory under Portuguese administration. In order to achieve this, a comprehensive comparative study of other countries' <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreements</b> is undertaken. This involves carrying out a detailed examination of, inter alia, the theoretical, doctrinal and institutional features of the said agreements in general, and a practical study of various concrete agreements. Macau's current and future political and legal status is outlined with special consideration being paid to the unique status of the Territory vis-a-vis Portugal and the People's Republic of China. Macau's recently created civil aviation structure is presented along with the Territory's trading policy in general and more specifically, the international air policy to be adopted. Finally, based on the above research, a proposal is presented, in the conclusion, for a standard <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreement</b> which Macau can use in its expanding civil aviation links with other countries...|$|R
50|$|The Chicago Convention couldn’t {{resolve the}} issue of who flies where, however, and this has {{resulted}} in the thousands of <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreements</b> in existence today. The benchmark standard for the early bilaterals was the 1946 United States-United Kingdom Bermuda Agreement.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreement</b> is a {{contract}} to liberalize aviation services, usually commercial civil aviation, between two contracting states. A bilateral air services agreement allows the airlines of both states to launch commercial flights that covers the transport of passengers and cargoes of both countries. A bilateral agreement may sometimes include the transport of military personnel of the contracting states.|$|R
50|$|Civil Aviation Authority, Bangladesh (CAAB) (বেসামরিক বিমান চলাচল কর্তৃপক্ষ) {{functions}} as the regulatory body for all aviation related activities in Bangladesh. It {{is the national}} aviation authority operating under the Ministry of Civil Aviation & Tourism. All nine operational airports (three international and six domestic) are operated by the CAAB. A member of International Civil Aviation Organization, it has signed <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreement</b> with 52 states. It is headquartered in Kurmitola, Dhaka.|$|R
50|$|The Agreement {{between the}} {{government}} of the United Kingdom and {{the government of the}} United States relating to Air Services between their respective Territories (Bermuda Agreement), reached in 1946 by American and British negotiators in Bermuda, was an early <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreement</b> regulating civil air transport. It established a precedent for the signing of approximately 3,000 other such agreements between countries. The Agreement was replaced by the Bermuda II Agreement, signed in 1977 and effective in 1978.|$|R
5000|$|Bermuda II was a <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreement</b> {{between the}} governments of the United Kingdom and the United States signed on 23 July 1977 as a renegotiation of the {{original}} 1946 Bermuda air services agreement. A new [...] "open skies" [...] agreement was signed by the United States and the European Union (EU) (of which the United Kingdom is part) on 30 April 2007 and came into effect on 30 March 2008, thus replacing Bermuda II.|$|R
50|$|Another {{sign of the}} {{expanding}} bilateral relationship is the signing of a <b>Bilateral</b> Air <b>Transport</b> <b>Agreement</b> in December 2003. Several U.S. carriers already have third-party code sharing agreements with Vietnam Airlines. Direct flights between Ho Chi Minh City and San Francisco began in December 2004. Vietnam and the United States also signed a bilateral Maritime Agreement in March 2007 that opened the maritime transport and services industry of Vietnam to U.S. firms. In 2011 the U.S.banks agreed to invest $1.5 billion to the Vietnamese infrastructure.|$|R
40|$|This essay briefly {{discusses}} {{the reality that}} I have experienced in air transport for some time. In this field, the world is still ruled by <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreements.</b> Such <b>bilateral</b> agreements are even in force in Europe. This essay asks several questions. First, what does successful deregulation in Europe really mean? Would deregulation be successful if many low-cost carriers flew throughout Europe and carried mostly point-to-point traffic from point A to B? I personally think that very few routes are suitable for this point-to-point traffic...|$|R
50|$|He {{served in}} the Department of State under four administrations, {{nominated}} the last three times by the Presidents Carter, Clinton and Obama. From 1965-70 he was Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs. In that role he negotiated numerous international <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreements,</b> represented the U.S. at meetings of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the International Maritime Organization (IMCO), and was vice-chair of the U.S. delegation to the multinational negotiations that successfully created the present structure of INTELSAT, the organization that operates the space segments of the international communications network.|$|R
50|$|The heavily {{regulated}} {{aviation industry}} also meant aviation rights are often negotiated between governments, denying airlines {{the right to}} an open market. These <b>Bilateral</b> Air <b>Transport</b> <b>Agreements</b> similar to the Bermuda I and Bermuda II agreements specify rights awardable only to locally registered airlines, forcing some governments to jump-start airlines to avoid being disadvantaged {{in the face of}} foreign competition. Some countries also establish flag carriers such as Israel's El Al or Lebanon's Middle East Airlines for nationalist reasons, or to aid the country's economy, particularly in the area of tourism.|$|R
40|$|In {{the study}} of the history of {{international}} relations much of the focus has been on the high politics of alliances. Trading interests, generally regarded as belonging to the realm of low politics, have received less attention, although they were often significant. Aviation serves here as an example. As symbols of national prestige, airlines have {{played an important role in}} bilateral relations. An exchange of landing rights symbolizes a good relationship between countries. When disputes between countries arise, air transport is one of the first fields to suffer. Although the Netherlands recognized the People’s Republic of China in 1950, political differences ensured that a <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreement</b> was not reached until 1979. It was not ratified, however. When The Hague approved the delivery of two submarines to the Taiwanese navy in 1980, Beijing regarded this as an unfriendly act. In the years that followed, Dutch airlines began services to Taiwan, under a private contract. This became a new obstacle to normal relations with the People’s Republic. Beijing regarded the Dutch air services to Taiwan as an infringement of Chinese sovereignty. Only after years of diplomatic skirmishes and the removal of all symbols of nationality from the aircraft used on the route to Taipeh was a <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreement</b> with the People’s Republic signed in 1996. This shows that aviation played a more important role in bilateral relations than is generally assumed...|$|R
40|$|Through a {{comparative}} study of the aviation policies in the principal countries of North America (the United States) and Europe (Germany), this thesis will examine China's aviation policy and its situation in the trend toward liberalization, placing special emphasis on bilateral agreements. This thesis will describe the historic evolution of the economic regulation in civil air transport that {{laid the foundation for}} <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> service <b>agreements</b> and the Open Skies regime. Moreover, the development of bilateral air services agreements, from the Bermuda Agreements to the U. S. 's "Open Skies" Policy, is addressed. Then, a study of the ICAO actions toward liberalization is undertaken. An analysis from the deregulation, privatization in the American and E. U. 's aviation market to the reform in the Chinese civil aviation is conducted. Under the impact of the global liberalization trend, the Chinese aviation industry is creating a "deepen, widen" reform. Specifically, China Southern's imminent entrance into SkyTeam will significantly push the Chinese aviation policy toward liberalization. A detailed {{comparative study of}} <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreements</b> between China, the United States, and Germany will show the recent progress of the Chinese aviation policy. Finally, an argument for the separation of air cargo from air passengers in the liberalization process, especially for China's negotiation of bilateral agreements, is presented...|$|R
50|$|Since the 1944 {{signing of}} the Convention on International Civil Aviation, {{international}} aviation was based on <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreements,</b> in which government would negotiate the rights {{of one or more}} flag carriers to operate routes between the countries. The negotiations focused on retaining each country's flag carrier's market share and also effectively hindered any airline from not being domestically owned—either by the government or by private investors. In 1992, the United States started negotiating open skies agreements with the European Union (EU), which would allow any European airline to fly from any airport in their home country to any airport in the US, and similarly any US airline to fly from any US airport to any European airport.|$|R
50|$|Modern Air's {{management}} {{sought to}} counteract the advantages British competitors enjoyed in the West Berlin charter market by partnering long-standing business partner Berliner Flugring in launching the city's first regular, all year round long-haul charter flight programme. It was thought that, in addition to picking {{up some of the}} lucrative contracts for an extensive short-/medium-haul West Berlin charter flight programme from Tegel Airport a consortium of three West German tour operators had awarded to defunct British rival Channel Airways in September 1970 (beginning in March 1971), this would provide sufficient utilisation for the airline's additional Berlin-based aircraft and enable it to obtain better rates than in the city's heavily contested short-/medium-haul charter market. This in turn would allow Berliner Flugring to further differentiate itself from rivals and enable it to charge its customers a premium for a new, unique and superior product. However, this was dependent on regulatory approval by the Allied Air Attachés in Bonn and the aviation authorities of destination countries. However, as a result of pressure exerted by Pan Am, British European Airways (BEA) and Air France on the Allied Air Attachés, as well as objections lodged by the destination countries' national airlines with their aviation authorities, the relevant approvals were withheld. The established airlines viewed Modern Air's plans as a backdoor route to the scheduled air market. They feared that granting permission to a non-member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) outside the relevant intergovernmental, <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreements</b> would set a precedent for other non-IATA members to bypass regulatory restrictions in contemporary <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreements</b> that limited access to scheduled air services and encourage circumvention of IATA fare rules by non-members.|$|R
25|$|Negotiations {{subsequently}} turned {{towards the}} amount of that tax, and Switzerland offered {{to build a new}} high-speed rail link through the Alps for the main purpose of intermodal transport, which has been accepted by a public vote on 27 September 1992. The EU finally accepted the offer in 2000, but demanded that the then valid 28-tonne limit for trucks be raised to 48 tonnes. A compromise was reached on a step-by-step raise of the weight limit to 40 tonnes. The <b>bilateral</b> Land <b>Transport</b> <b>Agreement</b> with the European Union was thus signed, agreeing to an increase of the kilometre-based tax on HGVs from 1.6ct/tkm to 1.8ct/tkm at completion of the NRLA. This condition has been deemed fulfilled at the completion of the Lötschberg Base Tunnel.|$|R
50|$|Negotiations {{subsequently}} turned {{towards the}} amount of that tax, and Switzerland offered {{to build a new}} high-speed rail link through the Alps for the main purpose of intermodal transport, an offer which was later accepted by the EU but not without an attached condition that the then valid 28-tonne limit for trucks must be raised to 48 tonnes. A settlement was achieved with both sides accepting a step-by-step raise of the weight limit to 40 tonnes. Thus, the <b>bilateral</b> Land <b>Transport</b> <b>Agreement</b> with the European Union was reached and once the NRLA is finished, the kilometre-based tax on HGVs can be increase from 1.6 ct/tkm to 1.8 ct/tkm.

2500|$|The {{conclusion}} of the first fully liberalised <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreement</b> in Europe between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in 1985, {{as well as a}} legal technicality exempting the airline from the [...] "London [...] Traffic Distribution Rules" [...] (a government policy that sought to compel all airlines that were planning to operate an international scheduled service to or from Heathrow {{for the first time to}} use Gatwick instead) as a result of having operated a Heathrow–Strasbourg scheduled service prior to this policy coming into effect on 1 April 1978, enabled BMA to compete directly with BA between Heathrow and Amsterdam from 29 June 1986. This resulted in BMA becoming the first private, independent airline to compete with then wholly government-owned BA on an international trunk route from Heathrow.|$|R
40|$|Many nations, {{except the}} United States, have long {{regulated}} non-scheduled air services under their <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreements.</b> Though inconstant and largely superficial, this regulation has served {{to alleviate the}} constrictive effects of multifarious laws and regulations, enacted to keep charter expansion in check. The (mainly) unilateral, diverse legal regimes charters have had to face have not stopped their growth. The late 1960 s saw their worth: inter alia, their low fares facilitated tourism, filled empty aircraft seats, and injected some competition into a highly regulated industry. The Americans then realised that, absent the legal uncertainty that continuously plagued charters, and fueled by free-enterprise concepts, non-scheduled US carriers, to their benefit, could move substantial national traffic. Legal certainty and competition, assured by bilateral treaties, led the United States to begin substantial bilateral regulation of charter services. This evolution of non-scheduled air services, through bilateralism, is traced in this thesis...|$|R
5000|$|The People Power Revolution in 1986 {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of expansion of bilateral relations between the two countries. Italy was the first country to recognize the Presidency of Corazon Aquino in the Philippines.

The Philippines has welcomed a huge Italian business mission. The Confederation of Italian Industries, Italy's biggest association of manufacturing and services companies. The delegation also had parallel sectoral programs on trading, infrastructure and energy. Business-to-business meetings were also arranged between Italian and Philippine companies.

40|$|Air {{transport}} is by {{its very}} nature one of the most international of economic activities. However, until fairly recently, its regulatory framework has been premised on an overriding nationalism developed and maintained {{on the basis of the}} following: substantial ownership and effective control provisions found in national legislation and most <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> agreements; restrictions on cabotage found in national legislation, most <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreements</b> and Article 7 of the Chicago Convention; and the related national restrictions on the right of establishment applicable to national carriers. However, as the international component of the air transport industry has grown in importance, the tenets underlying this restrictive regulatory system are increasingly coming into question. This thesis examines the development of international airline co-operation and integration, namely by way of mergers, franchises and alliances, in the face of the existing regulatory obstacles. It examines the legal impediments to, the form of, and the costs and benefits of each of these integrative methods and their various derivatives. Finally, it traces the regulatory responses to these integrative activities, and explores the possibility and methodology of creating a truly global airline, both in form and in function...|$|R
50|$|The Fly America Act is {{generally}} regarded as being anti-competitive and as unfairly favoring U.S. airlines and can result in significant travel budget issues. However, it does offer U.S. airlines some recompense for the U.S. government's Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program and provides balance {{against some of the}} existing, largely obsolescent and, in many cases, inequitable <b>bilateral</b> U.S./non‑U.S. Air <b>Transport</b> <b>Agreements</b> (ATAs). This partly accounts for the U.S. State Department's reluctance to grant exception in accordance with 40 USC 40101 (e), International Aviation Policy or any other exemption provisions (see below). The U.S. is systematically replacing these ATAs by Open Skies agreements, which are considerably more liberal in their reciprocal arrangements.|$|R
40|$|Member Countries of the Andean Community (ANCOM) have {{established}} a supranational legal regime applicable to intra and extra-subregional air transport activities: the Andean Subregional Air Transport Integration system. This regime was established by Decisions 297 and 320 and {{was based on the}} Colombia-Venezuela <b>Bilateral</b> Air <b>Transport</b> <b>Agreement.</b> It revolutionizes the status quo regarding air transport. The new regime adopts the principles of multiple designation of air carriers, free determination of frequencies and capacities for scheduled air services performed with the Subregion, and complete liberalization for non-scheduled air services. It creates an "Andean subregional market" and promotes the establishment of a "common" position for negotiating intra and extra-regional fifth freedom. Member Countries have been unresponsive in updating their bilateral agreements vis-a-vis the regime set by Decisions 297 and 320. This situation makes the application and healthy development of the Andean Subregional Air Transport Integration process difficult.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{problems related}} to particular labor laws currently applied in international air transport. This analysis is framed {{within the context of}} scholarly theory and judicial practice arising from various regimes of labor law governing industrial injury, the individual contract of employment, labor-management relations, and fair treatment in the civil aviation industry. A critical survey of labor regulations operating in the international air transport industry is provided through commentary on the principles formulated by judicial decisions and the theories which underlie their reasoning, helping to clarify both substantive and procedural labor laws affecting international air transport. A critical analysis of different categories of statutory labor law governing international air transport is also provided to assess the validity of commonly-erected conflict of labor law rules, thereby revealing the inadequacy of the single rule principle in view of the unique and perplexing regulatory interests which are inherent in aviation activity. The divergence between domestic labor statutes and Treaties of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation or <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreements</b> also adds a more subtle aspect to the problems explored...|$|R
50|$|The Japan-United States <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreement</b> of 1952 {{has been}} viewed as being {{particularly}} contentious, because unlimited fifth freedom traffic rights have been granted to designated US air carriers serving destinations in the Asia Pacific region west of Japan. For example, in the early 1990s, the Japanese government's refusal to permit flights on the New York City—Osaka—Sydney route led to protests by the US government and the airlines that applied to serve that route. The Japanese government countered that about 10% of the traffic on the Japan - Australia sector was third and fourth freedom traffic {{to and from the}} US, while the bilateral agreement specified that primary justification for unlimited fifth freedom traffic was to fill up aircraft carrying a majority of US-originated or US-destined traffic under third and fourth freedom rights. Japan had held many unused fifth freedom traffic rights beyond the USA. However, these were seen as being less valuable than the fifth freedom traffic rights enjoyed by US air carriers via Japan, because of the higher operating costs of Japanese airlines and geographical circumstances. Japan serves as a useful gateway to Asia for North American travelers. The US contended that Japan's favourable geographical location and its flag airlines' carriage of a sizeable volume of sixth freedom traffic via gateway cities in Japan helped to level the playing field. In 1995, the air <b>transport</b> <b>agreement</b> was updated by way of liberalizing Japanese carriers' access to US destinations, while placing selected restrictions on US air carriers.|$|R
2500|$|One of the Edwards report's {{recommendations}} was {{the creation}} of a financially and managerially sound, so-called Second Force private sector airline to operate a viable network of short- and long-haul scheduled and non-scheduled services. This [...] "Second Force" [...] airline was to be licensed to compete with state-owned BEA and BOAC on selected short-/long-haul routes, in accordance with the relevant <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreements.</b> Wherever <b>bilateral</b> agreements permitted a second British carrier, the [...] "Second Force" [...] was to assume this role.

In return, the [...] "National Air Holdings Board" [...] that was to assume control of the corporations was to be given a minority stake in the [...] "Second Force" [...] and at least one seat on its board. To enable the [...] "Second Force" [...] to become viable by 1980, its minimum size was to be at least 4 billion long-haul scheduled service seat miles (6.4 billion seat kilometres) per annum by 1975, and its fleet was to consist of at least 14 state-of-the-art long-haul aircraft, including three SSTs, three widebodied trijets and eight conventional narrowbodied jets.|$|R
40|$|This course {{focuses on}} the {{domestic}} and international economic regulation of air transport and also discusses safety and security regulation. Key themes are: Why do Governments regulate or deregulate markets for air transport? How do {{the economics of the}} aviation sector impact regulatory policies and vice versa? What are the legal regimes governing key issues of the aviation business, such as international routes, pricing, code-sharing, joint ventures, airline alliances, computer reservation systems, and airport slots? What is the relationship between sectoral airline regulation and competition law? What are the regulatory tools used by Governments as the means for regulating civil aviation? What is the nature of <b>bilateral</b> air <b>transport</b> <b>agreements?</b> What multilateral regimes govern the supply of aviation services? What are the present challenges and trends in the regulatory regime of air transport? Method of Evaluation: take home examination.

40|$|The {{formation}} of airline alliances {{has been a}} distinctive feature of the airline business {{at the threshold of}} the new millennium. This is due to the framework of <b>Bilateral</b> Air <b>Transport</b> <b>Agreements,</b> which condition the grant of traffic rights to substantial ownership and effective control being vested in nationals of one of the contracting parties. Further regulatory aspects pertaining to airline alliances include competition law review, traffic rights, and slot allocation. This thesis seeks to elucidate how Star had to adapt its strategic choices to this framework. The outcome will be that in particular the lack of regulatory convergence in competition law matters constitutes a hindrance to a global alliance such as Star. The issue of ownership and control might represent a further obstacle to an alliance intending to rely on mergers or major share holding, an ambition that Star has not nourished so far. Open Skies agreements in force between the U. S., Canada, and several member states of the European Union give alliances full commercial opportunities, unhindered by restrictive capacity or approval of fares provisions. The principles as regards slot allocation, on the other hand, have enabled alliances to build up their hubs as fortresses. The issues of competition law, and ownership and control illustrate that it has become increasingly insufficient to rely on a merely bilateral approach to global problems. Eventually, satisfactory solutions may only be achieved on a multilateral level. The onus thus is on aviation regulators {{to come up with a}} more suitable framework for aviation in the next century. Multilateralism, however, might turn out to herald the end to the alliance phenomenon. Once the bilateral strait jacket put aside, the aviation industry will consolidate like any other industry: by mergers, that is...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{definition}} {{is rooted in}} the fact that pursuant to Article 17 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation aircraft have the nationality of the state in which they are registered.U.S. law (14 CFR § 121.153 (a) (1)) requires American air carriers to operate aircraft registered in the United States and most countries have similar laws.Thus when an airline operates an international route, between two countries, having been designated pursuant to a <b>Bilateral</b> Air <b>Transport</b> <b>Agreement</b> any crime that would be committed on board would be prosecuted under the laws of the airline's state. Article 3 (1) of Tokyo Convention declares that [...] "The State of registration the aircraft is competent to exercise jurisdiction over [...] "offenses and acts committed on board." [...] " [...] Therefore the aircraft is truly carrying the flag of its country. [...] The American definition of [...] "U.S.-flag air carrier service" [...] contained in 48 CFR 47.403-1. is based on this first definition. The U.S. requirements under the Fly America Act, are consistent with requiring that Title 18 of the United States Code (U.S. Criminal Law) would protect U.S. government employees on flights to foreign countries.The second and more broadly used definition of [...] "flag carrier" [...] is a legacy of the time when countries established state-owned airline companies. Governments then took the lead due to the high capital costs of establishing and running airlines. However, not all such airlines were government-owned; Pan Am, TWA, Cathay Pacific, Union de Transports Aériens, Canadian Pacific Air Lines and Olympic Airlines were all privately owned. Most of these were considered to be flag carriers as they were the [...] "main national airline" [...] and often a sign of their country's presence abroad.|$|R
