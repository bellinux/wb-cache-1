40|$|When {{oil and gas}} wells {{reach the}} end of their {{production}} life, they need to be permanently plugged and abandoned. The requirements for a permanent barrier state that it must cover the entire cross-section of the wellbore, including all annuli. This thesis evaluates a new method of establishing a cross-sectional barrier in areas with poor, non-sealing annular cement. The traditional method is to mill away the section with poor cement and set an open hole cement plug, but due to the ECD effect of milling fluids, this is not always desirable. In some formations on the Gullfaks field, the operational pressure window is too small for section milling. An alternative solution was therefore tried out on a well that needed plugging. This method, referred to as punch and squeeze, consisted of perforating the section of poorly cemented casing and squeezing cement into the annulus. In this thesis, the equipment and techniques used are presented and evaluated, along with general theory relevant to plugging and abandonment. On Gullfaks, two punch and squeeze techniques were used. In the first, cement was pumped through a packer plug and squeezed into the perforations. The second technique involved setting a balanced cement plug over the perforations, and squeezing this plug into the perforations. The main conclusions are that the technique using a packer plug is safer with regards to well control, involves less waiting on cement and gives a better annular seal than the <b>balanced</b> <b>plug</b> alternative. Also, a cement evaluation log should be run before the squeeze jobs are performed, and the log results should be used when determining where to perforate. All things considered, {{it was found that the}} punch and squeeze method can succeed in creating a length of cross-sectional cement, but still involves some uncertainty and the technique can be further optimized...|$|E
50|$|The closure {{member of}} the valve, plugs are {{connected}} to the stem which is slid or screwed up or down to throttle the flow. Plugs are typically of the balance or unbalanced type. Unbalanced plugs are solid and are used with smaller valves or with low pressure drops across the valve. The advantages are simpler design, with one possible leak path at the seat and usually lower cost. The disadvantages are the limited size; with a large unbalanced plug the forces needed to seat and hold the flow often becomes impractical. <b>Balanced</b> <b>plugs</b> have holes through the plug. Advantages include easier shut off as the plug does not have to overcome static forces. However, a second leak path is created between the plug and the cage, and cost is generally higher.|$|R

Spark <b>plugs</b> were located on the inboard side of the cylinder heads and were accessed {{from the top of}} the engine. This position reduced the likelihood of water being splashed on to the spark plugs and causing the engine to misfire or stall.

40|$|The {{extraction}} {{of oil from}} dittany (Origanum dictamnus) using supercritical carbon dioxide was investigated. The experiments were performed in a bench scale apparatus at the pressures of 100 and 150 bar and at the temperatures of 40 and 60 °C. The effect of the solvent flow rate and the mean particle diameter of dittany on the extraction yield was also investigated at 100 bar and 40 °C. It is shown that the extraction yield increases with pressure, while the increase of temperature and mean particle diameter leads to the opposite effect. Different flow rates of SCCO 2 lead to similar extraction yields. Finally, the overall extraction curves are well correlated by a mass <b>balance</b> model of <b>plug</b> flow, in which the intraparticle diffusion resistance has the controlling role. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract. A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} derived to describe the pressure drop along the conveying and reverse sections of a partly full, fully intermeshing co-rotating twin-screw extruder. The model extends previous work on single screw extrusion, whereby the Benbow-Bridgwater model of paste rheology is combined with a force <b>balance</b> on a <b>plug</b> of paste. Experiments to verify the model {{have been carried out}} using a laboratory scale twin-screw extruder fitted with a hydraulic feeder and a modified barrel section allowing the collection of pressure data at numerous points along the extruder. Initial results suggested that the model was able to correctly predict the trends observed but underestimated the absolute values of the pressure. This was attributed to a change in the rheology of the paste due to viscous heating effects. Further experimental work was carried out to determine the relationship between the rheological parameters and temperature; this allowed a temperature correction to be made to the initial data after which the agreement with the predictions was greatly improved...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a hybrid modelling approach for {{the prediction of}} the thermally-induced aggregation of whey protein solutions in a continuous process. Modelling a continuous process needs to account the fluid flow phenomena because the different fluid parcels are not subjected to the same time/temperature/shear history. The modelling approach developed combines a residence time distribution (RTD) model and a colloidal aggregation model based on Population Balance Equations (PBE). This combined model has been compared, on one side, to a Population <b>Balance</b> Model assuming <b>plug</b> flow, {{and on the other}} side, to experimental data. A 6 % beta-lactoglobulin solution with different CaCl 2 concentrations (5. 0, 6. 0, 6. 4, 6. 6 and 7. 0 mM) was used for experimental investigations. Experimental heat treatments were carried out at 87 degrees C with a holding time of 49 s using tubular heat exchanger and holder. The integration of residence time distribution appears to be very important when the product is subject to large transformations (formation of large aggregates > 10 mu m). Comparison of predictions obtained from both models to the experimental data shows that the coupled PBE/RTD model is able to predict the characteristics of the suspensions (aggregate size and viscosity) and successfully integrates the impact of calcium upon aggregation process, while the model assuming plug flow is suitable only when aggregation is low (for low calcium concentrations) ...|$|R
40|$|In the North Sea, {{the average}} field age is {{increasing}} {{and a large}} number of wells needs to be plugged and abandoned in the future. P&A is regarded as an operation with no financial returns and is associated with significantly high costs. With a continuous {{increase in the number of}} wells that require abandonment and a falling oil price, the major focus for the oil industry is reducing costs while ensuring safe and reliable plugging of wells. The conventional method for placing a plug in a cased hole with no external barrier has required section milling of the casing, underreaming the open hole, and placing a <b>balanced</b> cement <b>plug.</b> The conventional method is time-consuming and costly, and is associated with several challenges and risks concerning Health, Safety and Environment (HSE). To reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of P&A operations, more attention has been directed towards the subject of P&A in recent years. This thesis has examined and presented the conventional section milling technology along with its limitations and challenges, and compared it with new technology’s with respect to time and scope. The main focus has been the new perforate, wash and cement (PWC) technology developed by HydraWell, and its advancement in the P&A operation. A case study comparing the conventional section milling operation with the PWC operation has been performed. Other investigated alternatives include reverse/upward section milling and plasma-based milling. This thesis also gives an insight into the process of plugging a well, including regulations and requirements, plugging materials, placement techniques, cement evaluation tools and challenges with the P&A process. The main findings revealed that most of the challenges with the section milling operation can be led back to the generated swarf. The case study revealed that the installation of the reservoir and secondary barrier was the most time-consuming part of the P&A operation. It also revealed that by applying the PCW technology, the operational time used to install the reservoir and secondary barrier could potentially be reduced by 73 % compared to the section milling operation. Considering the impressive scope ahead, the PWC technology has potential to reduce cost significantly for operating companies and national authorities in the future...|$|R
40|$|Preserving meat {{quality is}} {{paramount}} during meat processing. Contamination {{is reduced by}} preventing contact between faecal matter and the carcass. Rectal plugs are {{used for this purpose}} during slaughtering, and the animal’s intestines can be removed and entered directly into the rendering process. Polypropylene plugs contaminate rendered products, while Novatein® plugs (the Port Jackson) will break down during the rendering process. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was used to determine and compare the environmental impacts of plugs made from either polypropylene or Novatein®. Two scenarios were considered, in which the production of the plugs could be contracted out, or manufactured in-house. On an environmental basis, the difference was negligible. Resin production accounted for 73 % of the total non-renewable primary energy (NRPE) use and global warming potential (GWP), with the <b>balance</b> shared between <b>plug</b> production, use, and disposal. Injection moulding and packaging each contributed 31 % to GWP, as well as 25. 8 % and 40 % of the NRPE use respectively during plug production and disposal, dominating impacts during plug production. In contrast, operations with the lowest impacts were conditioning and transport, collectively contributing to less than 4 % of the entire LCA impacts. The life cycle impacts were particularly sensitive to packaging, the allocation method used for farming impacts on bloodmeal production, and the ratio of the electricity grid mix. By eliminating cardboard boxes reduced GWP and NRPE use by 6. 1 % and 6. 9 %. Allocating impacts from farming to bloodmeal production could increase the GWP by up to 193 %, and NRPE by 14 %. Allocation is not {{under the control of the}} manufacturer, and is a limitation of the assumptions made in this study. By using coal-based electricity, the GWP can increase by 66 %, and NRPE by 20 %. Impacts from electricity use could change noticeably if the plugs were manufactured overseas. The net present value (NPV) of capturing 10 % of the market, and selling the plugs at $ 0. 15 NZD, at a 35 % discount rate was $ 143, 629 when contracting out plug production. Under all costing assumptions, contracting out provided a higher NPV than manufacturing in-house. This is primarily due to the large capital costs when producing in-house. The critical factor that will cause manufacturing in-house to be more financially viable is the capital cost. The difference between the NPV of the two scenarios is $ 240, 442, and the estimated total cost of buying, shipping, and installing the injection moulder is $ 355, 153. If this can be reduced to $ 114, 711, the two scenarios become equal. Because manufacturing in-house has a higher ongoing cash inflow per year, this scenario will also benefit more from scaling up volume above the 10 % market share threshold. When comparing the Port Jackson with the polypropylene plug, the Novatein® plug has a higher GWP (0. 0166 kg CO₂eq per plug) than the PP plug (0. 0126 kg CO₂eq per plug), however, it requires less NRPE (0. 302 MJ per plug and 0. 430 MJ per plug respectively), and if contracted out, can be sold competitively at a matching market value of $ 0. 15 or $ 0. 16 per plug. The price may be lowered even further to $ 0. 12, and still have a positive NPV. These factors are slightly in favour of producing Novatein plugs, but the Port Jackson’s advantage over PP is the fact that it not only breaks down during rendering, but it is also non-toxic, so simply becomes part of part of meat and bone meal...|$|R
40|$|Cold Flow Technology” (CFT) is an {{alternative}} solution to deal with gas hydrate formation in subsea flowlines. Transient multiphase flow with gas hydrate particles is an important research area of the CFT, {{which has not been}} thoroughly investigated yet. Therefore, this PhD program was initiated as a basis for further research on this aspect of the CFT. Investigation on the phase equilibrium of gas hydrate particles was {{the second part of the}} present study. The subject was chosen as the CFT relies on the transportation of thermodynamically stable gas hydrate particles. The first step of the PhD work was designing and building a new experimental facility at the multiphase flow laboratory of the Department of Energy and Process Engineering (NTNU-EPT). The setup consisted of an asymmetrical V-shape pipe capable of measuring flow rate, pressure and particle volume fraction. The experiments were carried out using polymeric particles representing real hydrate particles and with water as the model fluid. Finding a proper model hydrate particle and preparing a sufficient quantity of the model particle were the most challenging parts of this work completed in cooperation with the SINTEF Materials and Chemistry group. A hydrophobic model hydrate particle was initially chosen based on different criteria like density, availability and cost. In the next step, 150 Kg of the model particle were purchased, degassed and sieved. Eventually, the surface properties of the particles were modified using very high concentration chemicals. The surface treated particles could be dispersed in water without adding any chemicals. In order to investigate the transient flow behavior of a potential hydrate plug during re-start operation of a subsea flowline facilitated with CFT, a series of experiments on flowline re-start was undertaken. The results of the experiments showed an additional frictional pressure drop due to the movement of the hydrate plug, especially in the bend. Moreover, the average particle phase velocity of the dispersed phase flowing in front of the hydrate plug was higher than the mixture velocity in the majority of the measured data. The increased particle velocity may be due to dispersion of the hydrate plug in water. Despite the particle phase velocity in front of the hydrate plug, the average particle phase velocity of the plug tail was slightly lower than the mixture velocity. In order to model the plug flow experiments, a simple one dimensional flow model was initially developed using the continuity equation and without considering any extra terms. However, benchmarking of the flow model showed that more physical details should be included in the model. Therefore, the initial model was developed further, taking into account the axial dispersion of the particle phase, the increased particle phase velocity caused by the plug front dispersion and the additional frictional pressure drop caused by the hydrate plug. The effect of axial dispersion was taken into account by adding a diffusion term to the particle phase continuity equation. The effect of plug front dispersion on increasing the particle phase velocity was determined by applying a mass <b>balance</b> at the <b>plug</b> front. The modified model was capable of qualitatively reproducing the results of the plug flow experiments. The thermodynamic stability of gas hydrate particles was investigated by proposing two thermodynamic models both based on the Van der Waals - Platteeuw theory. Since wellstream water is an electrolyte solution, the models were developed to precisely predict the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions of gas hydrates in presence of electrolyte solutions. As the starting point, the rather simple Pitzer model was used to calculate the water activity in electrolyte solutions. The parameters of the Pitzer model were adjusted using the experimental data at the lowest temperature found in the literature. A mixing rule was proposed to obtain the activity of water in mixed electrolyte solutions. The results of the model were in good agreement with experimental data. In the second thermodynamic model, a Mean Spherical Approximation (MSA) based model was employed to compute the water activity in electrolyte solutions. Initially and in order to improve the accuracy of the model, a new relation was proposed for describing the concentration dependency of the model’s adjustable parameters at 25 oC. Then, the adjustable parameters were extended with respect to temperature variations within the gas hydrate equilibrium conditions. In addition, the model was extended to calculate the solubility of CO 2 in single and mixed electrolyte solutions. The results of the proposed work both on computing CO 2 solubility and the gas hydrates equilibrium conditions were in good agreement with the experimental data and those presented in other works. Fewer adjustable parameters and the capability of modeling a mixture with different species can illustrate the complexity of the MSA based model. For instance, in case of a need for chemical injection, the MSA based model might be extended accordingly. PhD i energi- og prosessteknikkPhD in Energy and Process Engineerin...|$|R
