40|$|This article {{examines}} potential prosodic predictors of emotional speech in utterances perceived as conveying that good or <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> is <b>about</b> to be delivered. Speakers {{were asked to}} call an experimental confederate to inform her {{about whether or not}} she had been given a job she had applied for. A perception study was then performed in which initial fragments of the recorded utterances, not containing any explicit lexical cues to emotional content, were presented to listeners who had to rate whether good or <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> would follow the utterance. The utterances were then examined to discover acoustic and prosodic features that distinguished between good and <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> It was found that speakers in the production study were not simply reflecting their own positive or negative mood during the experiment, but rather appeared to be influenced by the valence of the positive or negative message they were preparing to deliver. Positive and negative utterances appeared to be judged differently with respect to a number of perceived attributes of the speakers’ voices (like sounding hesitant or nervous). These attributes correlated with a number of automatically obtained acoustic features...|$|R

The {{number of people who}} die by suicide is also increasing, as is the number of young people attempting suicide. Early intervention is essential to reverse these trends. However, repeated cuts to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) means that many young people can’t access the specialist support and therapies they need – with levels of self-harm potentially escalating while needs go unmet. Meanwhile, schools have increasingly been required to fill these gaps in services but without staff training or support. As well as re-investment in CAMHS, it’s also time to focus on developing the capacity of schools, and other youth settings, to help prevent this escalation of harm in the future...|$|R

When Lois tells Chris that the only person he should turn to in this situation is himself, Chris beats Brian with a chair as an excuse to return to the vet, sees Anna there, and apologizes to her. She forgives Chris and they renew their relationship, while Brian collapses to the floor in pain. Brian asks for help but Stewie comes in and kicks Brian in his stomach, before leaving him there.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{composition}} of the painting is in {{the contrast between the}} solemn jester (Stańczyk)– obviously the focus of the painting– and the lively ball going on in the background. Stańczyk is shown sitting alone in a dark room, while a ball, hosted by the royal family, is in full swing in the neighbouring hall. His appearance is unlike that one would expect in a jester– gloomy, deep in thought. His seriousness is reinforced by his accessories: his marotte lies discarded on the floor, whereas a holy medallion of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa can be seen on his torso. The wrinkled carpet at Stanczyk's feet could have been formed by his collapsing heavily into the chair upon reading the letter, or through a nervous shifting of the feet thereafter. On the table lies a letter likely announcing that Poland has lost Smolensk (now in Russia) to the Grand Duchy of Muscovy, causing Stańczyk's sorrow and reflection on his fatherland's fate. The letter seems to have been discarded by some official, and only the jester realizes its significance– while the rulers are partying, celebrating the recent victory at the battle of Orsha, disregarding the <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>about</b> Smolensk. [...] It {{is interesting to note that}} the letter bears the year 1533 (A.d. MDXXXIII) and the name [...] "Samogitia", a province of the Commonwealth. [...] The note is incongruent with the actual date of the fall of Smolensk in 1514, and is a matter of ongoing debate, with an outright mistake by the meticulous Matejko, known for use of symbolism and iconography, being unlikely. [...] Another symbol, a lute, symbol of glory, is being carried by a midget, stereotyped as a person of low stature and morale in Matejko's time; this suggests a decline of the Jagiellon dynasty's fortunes. The window is thrown - or was blown - open, ruffling the tablecloth and alluding to an upset of the present order. [...] Through the open window, the darkened profile of Wawel Cathedral in Krakow is visible - the site of the coronation of Polish kings. [...] Next to it, a comet is seen– a portent of ill fortune. [...] The imagery of downfall is completed with the inclusion of the three stars of Orion's Belt seen above and to the left of the cathedral spire. [...] In Greek mythology, Orion was a powerful hunter blinded by ego and his own greatness, but was ultimately brought down by the pinprick of a scorpion's sting.|$|E

40|$|We examine empirically the {{response}} of bond returns and their volatility to good and <b>bad</b> macroeconomic <b>news</b> during expansions and recessions. We find that macroeconomic announcements are most important when they contain <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> for bond returns in expansions and, to a lesser extent, good news in contractions. In expansions, the bond market responds most strongly to <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> in non-farm payrolls, while in recessions good <b>news</b> <b>about</b> inflation is relatively more important. We also document that macroeconomic news impacts the volatility of bond returns at all maturities by increasing jump intensities and altering the jump size distribution.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{breaking}} and receipt of <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> is little {{referred to in}} the mental health literature, particularly from a service user perspective. AIMS: This project aimed to gain understanding of service users' experiences of receiving good and <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> from mental health professionals. METHOD: Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted in which mental health service users recounted key moments when good or <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> was delivered to them and described the impact of that news on their psychological well being. Transcripts were analysed thematically. RESULTS: The receiving of a diagnosis could be perceived as <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> or a cause of confusion where a diagnosis is changed. The importance of trust in professionals, the use of adequate time and information was considered important in buffering the impact of potentially <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> The technique of comparing a mental disorder to a physical disorder is not always helpful. CONCLUSIONS: The delivery of <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> in mental health is more complex than a "good or bad news" paradigm and it should be done {{in the context of a}} good therapeutic alliance. An individualized approach to delivering <b>news</b> <b>about</b> diagnosis is advocated...|$|R

As such, the Japanese surrender in Singapore to the Allied forces led by Louis Mountbatten was represented by Itagaki Seishiro, commander of the 7th Area Army, on 12 September 1945. After the formal surrender, Terauchi was flown to Singapore from Saigon to present his two samurai swords to Mountbatten, on learning that Mountbatten had expressed his wish to have the swords. Terauchi was tried for war crimes, and was imprisoned in Johor, Malaysia, pending war crimes investigations by the British, until his death in November 1945. His remains were cremated and some of his ashes are believed to be buried at the park. The inscription on his tombstone reads: ...|$|E

No {{studies have}} examined how, or whether, psychologists are trained to break <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> and their current practice of breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> The purpose of this mixed method {{study was to explore}} the training and practices of psychologists in breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Particular attention was paid to whether theory related to the “MUM effect” could explain the findings, and whether psychologists are being taught practical skills related to breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> ^ Results suggested that psychologists are more reluctant to break <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> than good news and support the existence of the “MUM” effect in a sample of psychologists. Anxiety was shown to moderate the breaking of <b>bad</b> <b>news,</b> with more anxious respondents being more reluctant, due to their concern for self/other and norms. Half the sample broke <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> at least monthly, indicated that they break diverse types of <b>bad</b> <b>news,</b> and that they received little training in breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Psychologists also indicated that breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> was an important skill to have and a need for training in this area. ^ The qualitative portion of the study examined the reluctancy of respondents in more detail. Reluctant respondents most frequently cited concern for self/others, context, and norms as the reasons. In contrast, respondents who were not reluctant to break <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> most frequently cited their concern for the recipient and experience as reasons. Both groups were asked about the positive/negative effects of breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> and most indicated that it leads to intervention (+), positive coping (+), emotional distress (+) and it changes the therapeutic relationship (+ and −). Alternatively, the positive/negative effects of not breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> were that the recipient is better off/keeps them safe (+), endangers the recipient/communicator (−), maintains denial (−), maintains unrealistic expectations (−), and changes the therapeutic relationship (−). Implications and suggestions for training and practices for breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> are discussed. ...|$|R
