5000|$|U. S. President Harry Truman awarded Ives the Medal for Merit in 1948 for his war-time work on <b>blackout</b> <b>lighting</b> {{and optical}} {{communication}} systems.|$|E
50|$|After the war, Willys did not resume {{production}} of its passenger-car models, choosing instead {{to concentrate on}} Jeeps and Jeep-based vehicles. The first postwar Willys product was the CJ-2A, an MB stripped of obviously military features, particularly the <b>blackout</b> <b>lighting,</b> and {{with the addition of}} a tailgate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blackout</b> stop <b>lights</b> {{take the}} place the normal {{stoplight}} when operating in blackout conditions. In US military vehicles when the brakes are applied in blackout mode the brake light appears as a white <b>light.</b> The <b>blackout</b> stop <b>lights</b> are typically in the same taillight assembly as the rear <b>blackout</b> marker <b>lights.</b>|$|R
50|$|Blackout {{headlights}} {{can refer}} to either front <b>blackout</b> marker <b>lights</b> or <b>blackout</b> driving <b>light</b> depending on the vehicle that is equipped with them.|$|R
50|$|Onboard {{electrics}} are 24V as is {{the norm}} for utility vehicles of this class. They have two 12V batteries connected in series. Some all-wheel drive models also have <b>blackout</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A : Army. The {{company would}} also produce {{a model to}} the {{slightly}} different specifications of the Canadian Army, which would be named the WLC. The WLCs differed from WLAs chiefly {{in the use of}} some heavier components, usually Big Twin parts, as well as Canadian <b>blackout</b> <b>lighting.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The TRD Pro {{package was}} offered for 2015 models. Based on the TRD Off Road, the Pro package added a 2" [...] front lift with Bilstein 2.5-inch front shocks and 2.0-inch rear shocks with remote {{reservoirs}} for extra wheel travel, BFGoodrich all-terrain tires on 16-inch black and silver bead-lock-style wheels, and TRD cat-back exhaust system. Cosmetic upgrades included the scooped Sport hood, black badges, <b>blackout</b> <b>lighting</b> elements, a TRD Pro matte-black grille with TOYOTA lettering, and various TRD-badged interior parts. About 1200 TRD Pro Tacomas were made.|$|E
50|$|Militarisation {{packages}} and modification are extensive and range from basic to near-tactical, and can include air-conditioning and/ or an auxiliary heater to manage extreme climate conditions, <b>blackout</b> <b>lighting,</b> NATO trailer coupling, rifle brackets in the cab, a roof hatch for observation and/or {{a machine gun}} mount, and steel bumpers with black out lights. To enhance mobility, single tyred axles (with differential locks) are available, these with a central tyre inflation system (CTIS) and runflat inserts if required. More extensive militarisation can include a fording capability of up to 750 mm, a self-recovery winch, and military-specific electrics/electronics and communication/ command equipment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blackout</b> Driving <b>Lights</b> {{are mounted}} on the driver's side of the vehicle, {{typically}} on the fender or grille. They give off a diffused {{beam of white light}} that takes the place of regular headlights when driving under blackout conditions. It is intended to give off enough light for the driver to make his way. The <b>Blackout</b> Driving <b>Light</b> is also hooded making the light only {{to be able to be}} seen when looking up at it. With the use of night vision goggles the effectiveness of the <b>blackout</b> driving <b>light</b> can be increased.|$|R
50|$|Military {{vehicles}} that {{are equipped with}} <b>blackout</b> <b>lights</b> have a special switch for controlling the lights {{that are on the}} vehicle. This switch serves the purpose of preventing the headlights or any other lights on the vehicle from being turned on by accident, by means of a lock that is on the switch that must be pushed before the lights are able to be turned on.|$|R
50|$|The A350 {{comes with}} leather saddle bags {{and a few}} odd {{military}} accessories. One is the <b>blackout</b> <b>light</b> for night riding, {{and the other is}} mounts for two SIG 57 assault rifles. The side covers house a large air filter and spare bulbs and fuses in a foam block, and the other side contains a tool set, a lock, a cleaning brush, and goggles.|$|R
5000|$|Standard {{equipment}} suite includes {{rear view}} camera, thermal front camera, air conditioning system, <b>blackout</b> <b>lighting</b> system, multi-point seat belts, radio provisions, and a towing eye. It can be optionally {{equipped with a}} self-recovery winch, nuclear, biological and chemical filtration kit, automation fire extinguishing system, intercom system, navigation system and an auxiliary power unit. In an APC configuration the vehicle can carry nine personnel and the vehicle can be armed {{with a number of}} different weapons, including crew-operated machine guns and remote weapon stations armed with short-range surface-to-air missiles and grenade launchers. Powered by a 6.7L, six-cylinder, water cooled, turbo charged, common rail diesel engine that produces 281 hp, its maximum road speed is 110 km/h on roads and has a maximum cruising range of 700 km ...|$|E
5000|$|Although it {{bore the}} CJ name, the Willys-Overland CJ-2 {{was not really}} {{available}} at retail. The CJ-2s, also known as [...] "AgriJeeps," [...] were the second generation prototype for the first production civilian Jeep, and were used solely for testing purposes. It was directly based on the military Willys MB, using the same Willys Go Devil engine, but stripped of all military features, particularly the <b>blackout</b> <b>lighting.</b> They had tailgates, power take-offs (PTO's), engine governors ($28.65), column-shift T90 manual transmissions, 5.38 gears, 2.43:1 low-range transfer cases, and driver's-side tool indentations. The earlier models had brass plaques on the hood and windshield that read [...] "JEEP". Later models were stamped [...] "JEEP" [...] a la the familiar [...] "WILLYS" [...] stamping that appeared on the CJ-2A and later models. Some CJ-2s had [...] "AgriJeep" [...] plaques affixed to the dash. The spare tire was mounted forward of the passenger-side rear wheel on the earlier models and aft of the rear wheel on later ones. It seems that CJ-2s were distributed to [...] "agricultural stations" [...] for evaluation purposes. Of the 45 CJ-2s built, serial numbers CJ2-06, CJ2-09, CJ2-11, CJ2-12, CJ2-14, CJ2-26, CJ2-32, CJ2-37 and CJ2-39 have survived. Only CJ2-09 has been restored.|$|E
50|$|The mount can be traversed 180° {{left and}} right and the 7.62 mm machine gun can be {{elevated}} from -20° to +70°. There are 230 rounds of ready-use ammunition, and an additional 3,000 rounds carried inside the vehicle. The firing is electronically controlled with safety locking and braking together with a mechanical backup. There is also a last round indicator. The day sight has a wide field of view (22°) with 1x magnification and a collimated aiming circle, and a narrow field of view (8°) with 8x magnification and a ballistic graticule. The night sight has a wide field of view (22°) with 1x magnification and collimated aiming circle, and a narrow field of view (7°) with 7x magnification, a 25 mm image intensifier tube, and a ballistic graticule. Standard equipment includes an air conditioning system, a heater and defogger, an infrared driving headlamp, a <b>blackout</b> <b>lighting</b> system, a smoke extraction fan mounted on the roof, thick polyurethane roof and body interior lining for thermal and noise insulation, an explosion-suppressed fuel tank, and Hutchinson run-flat tires. Optional equipment includes a front-mounted electrical winch with 25 meters of cable at a capacity of 3,600 kg, 66 mm smoke grenade launchers, a pioneer kit (axe, shovel, pickaxe), a communications system, and a land navigation system.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Blackout</b> <b>lights</b> are {{head and}} tail lamps that are {{equipped}} with special lenses {{that are designed to}} cast a diffused horizontal beam of light for the driver of the vehicle to navigate with, and drivers of other vehicles to spot the vehicle with. In the military, they are intended for use when driving a convoy at night when it is necessary for the vehicles to maintain concealment by limiting their ability to be seen by the enemy.|$|R
5000|$|Introduced as the mil gl (for [...] "militarisiert geländegängig" [...] - military, {{cross country}} mobile), the MAN Kat1 series {{is used by}} all {{branches}} of the Bundeswehr. Militarization includes a full <b>blackout</b> <b>lights</b> circuit completely separated from the standard lights, a military instrument layout with blackout option, an emergency stop switch to cut electrical power, a roof hatch with rotary machine gun mount, and rifle brackets. The vehicles are category I (KAT I) special military developments, and as such fully cross-country mobile.|$|R
50|$|The Militarization of {{standard}} GM trucks/SUVs to become LSSVs includes exterior {{changes such as}} CARC paint (Forest Green, Desert Sand, or 3-color Camouflage), <b>blackout</b> <b>lights,</b> military bumpers, a brush guard, a NATO slave receptacle/NATO trailer receptacle, a pintle hook and tow shackles. The electrical system is changed to the 24/12 volt military standard. The dashboard has additional controls and dataplates. The truck also can be equipped with weapon supports in the cab, cargo tie down hooks, folding troop seats, pioneer tools, winches, and other military accessories.|$|R

50|$|Bright {{city lights}} {{made it easier}} for German U-boats to spot targets at night, but local {{officials}} resisted suggestions that they follow London's lead and <b>blackout</b> the <b>lights</b> of coastal cities. However, some lights were darkened, including those of the amusement parks in Coney Island, Brooklyn, and the Coney Island Light, and Sandy Hook Lighthouse.|$|R
50|$|The arena {{has hosted}} many WWE {{events such as}} Raw, SmackDown, and Unforgiven 2005. Raw came to the Chesapeake Energy Arena on September 25, 2006 and March 1, 2010 with Cheech & Chong {{appearing}} as the evening's guest hosts. During the show on September 25, 2006, {{the opening of the}} show suffered a <b>blackout,</b> but <b>lights</b> were restored shortly after the night began.|$|R
50|$|The Hunter TR-12's crew {{compartment}} is a mono-hull mounted on an independent chassis. It provides Level B6 (Standard EN 1063) protection levels, offering protection against rifle fire and ambushes. Each {{side of the}} hull has equipped two small armored windows and firing ports. Two doors are mounted {{at the front of}} each side of the {{crew compartment}} with small window and firing port. The Hunter TR-12 can mount a 360 degree roof turret with an M60 machine gun, an M2HB-QCB machine gun, or a Mk 19 grenade launcher. Weapons can be fitted to a remote weapons station. Its 4×4 chassis and runflat tires can handle off-road terrain. The vehicle has a crew of two and is capable of carrying 10 troops. The standard configuration has one spare wheel at the rear and comes with search lights and a thermal camera. It can be optionally fitted with <b>blackout</b> <b>lights,</b> a snorkel, and front winch.|$|R
50|$|Godwin's bike weighed {{more than}} 30 lb. As war came, he rode through <b>blackouts,</b> his <b>lights</b> taped to a glow. Silk {{knickers}} were substituted for chamois inserts and Godwin maintained his vegetarian diet. For {{the first two}} months, Godwin's mileage lagged 922 mi behind Nicholson's schedule. Godwin increased his daily average beyond 200 mi a day, and on 21 June 1939 completed 361 mi in 18 hours, his longest ride of the record.|$|R
5000|$|Rock Sound TV {{has used}} the [...] "Toilet Circuit" [...] moniker to film a series of {{acoustic}} performances filmed in the grimiest locations at music venues across the UK, featuring bands such as The <b>Blackout,</b> Thrice, Futures, <b>Lights,</b> Vessels and Deaf Havana.|$|R

50|$|During the midnight, the old deities {{are carried}} on the {{shoulders}} of the Dayitapatis and buried in the Koili Vaikuntha before dawn. There are three separate graves for the three deities, but all the previous Jagannaths are laid to rest in the same grave, {{one on top of the}} other. It is said that if anybody from outside this select group happens to see any of this ceremony, be it from a roof top or otherwise, they will surely die. The Government of Odisha therefore orders a full <b>blackout</b> of <b>light</b> on this one night in the whole town of Puri.|$|R
50|$|A ‘3-pass’ {{blackout}} {{can be used}} as {{a decorative}} fabric and blackout lining all in one fabric. A ‘2-pass’ cannot be used this way, because the black foam is visible through the fabric side of the material. In addition to blocking <b>light,</b> <b>blackout</b> fabrics also insulate and have noise-dampening qualities, due to their density and opacity.|$|R
40|$|Title continues: [...] . Due to <b>blackout</b> regulations, flood <b>lights,</b> switch lights, {{locomotive}} headlights {{and lights}} on the bridge in background have been shaded to cast light downward.

5000|$|<b>Blackout</b> Marker <b>Lights</b> {{serve the}} purpose of marking the {{position}} of the vehicle during blackout driving. They also are used as an aid in keeping the proper safe following distance when driving in a convoy at night. US Military marker lights are designed with a series of [...] "cat eyes" [...] that appear differently depending on the distance one is away from the vehicle that is equipped with the lights. When the following distance is too far the rear marker lights appear as a single red light and when too close as four separate red lights. When the correct following distance of 180 to 60 feet is maintained the taillights appear as two red lights.|$|R
5000|$|The Emboldened Navigator is an EP {{containing}} what {{is notable}} as the earliest recorded material from Frog Eyes. The line-up is Carey Mercer, Melanie Campbell, Michael Rak, and Spencer Krug. All four songs {{have been released}} as bonus tracks to the 2006 reissue of The Golden River, some under different titles. [...] "World Featuring Men and Knuckles" [...] as [...] ""Shots"", [...] "Only to Come Across Pleasant Meadows and Madames" [...] as [...] "Meadows And Madames And So Forth" [...] (later re-done on <b>Blackout</b> Beach's <b>Light</b> Flows the Putrid Dawn as [...] "Meadows and Pleasant Madames or Something of the Sort"), and [...] "They Did Not Notice the Rushing Rapids" [...] as [...] "American Waltz For The Good Americans".|$|R
50|$|For example, in 1911 it was {{commonly}} assumed that, {{just as a}} {{sound wave}} needed a medium to travel in, so did a light wave. Ether was postulated as the unknown substance that light traveled in. In the story an ether vacuum occurred when too much energy was radiated at once. Radiation caused more ether to be drawn to an area of energy expenditure {{and the lack of}} ether resulting from this overusage caused a temporary <b>blackout</b> because <b>light</b> could not travel where there was no ether. Heat and cold could also not be transferred during such a blackout. It is now known that such ether does not exist and is not needed for light to travel. Such effects are impossible.|$|R
5|$|On June 1, 1942, the US Supreme Court denied two of Waller's {{petitions}} for appeal, and {{the defense}} was soon left without further legal options. In a final attempt to win a pardon or commutation from the governor, activists staged events around the country, including a two-hour <b>blackout</b> of the <b>lights</b> in the primarily African-American neighborhood of Harlem in New York City. Governor Price's successor, Colgate Darden, received over seventeen thousand letters about the case.|$|R
50|$|Blackout {{refers to}} a foam-backed, opaque fabric used to black out <b>light.</b> <b>Blackout</b> fabrics are most {{commonly}} found in hotel rooms as curtain linings or drapery fabrics, blocking much of the light that would otherwise enter through a window when the curtains are closed. For travelers, third shift workers, and parents of babies, blackout is an essential element in the bedroom. Besides window coverings, other uses for blackout fabrics include wallpaper, movie projector screens and planetarium domes.|$|R
50|$|A {{blackout}} during war, or {{in preparation}} for an expected war, is the practice of collectively minimizing outdoor light, including upwardly directed (or reflected) light. This {{was done in the}} 20th century to prevent crews of enemy aircraft from being able to identify their targets by sight, for example during the London Blitz of 1940. In coastal regions a shore-side <b>blackout</b> of city <b>lights</b> also helped protect ships from being seen in silhouette against the shore by enemy submarines farther out at sea.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of this section, there is a [...] "Megamix Dance Party", performed by the dancers and backing singers, which is a mix of a selection of songs. Perry arrives on stage wearing a top, skirt, and leggings featuring smiling faces and peace symbols. She performs [...] "Walking on Air", where she is lifted above the stage and flies from on end to the other. Following this, she changes into a yin-yang dress to sing [...] "It Takes Two". While performing the song, she is lifted off the ground while the bottom half of her dress is inflated and covers the lift, to give the apprentice of her being very tall. To close this section of the tour, a mash-up of [...] "This Is How We Do" [...] and [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" [...] is performed as Perry and her dancers ride an inflatable car on stage. A video interlude is played, which shows Perry as a mental patient in a triangular padded cell, before paint splashes from all areas of the room. She appears on stage wearing a bra and skirt decorated with palm leaves to perform [...] "Teenage Dream". [...] "California Gurls" [...] is then performed with <b>blackout</b> <b>lights</b> and dancers move letters that eventually recreate the Hollywood Sign. Perry exits the stage before re-emerging to sing [...] "Birthday", wearing a one-piece outfit named the [...] "Birthday Suit", decorated with balloons over her breasts, and other birthday themed items. During the performance, Perry brings a member of the audience whose birthday is near the show's date on stage, and they sit on a throne on top of a rotating birthday cake, which emerges from the stage. She soon is trapped into a seat with multiple balloons attached to it and flies around the entire audience as balloons and confetti descend from above. Soon after, she exits the stage once more after thanking everyone for attending and introducing her band members.|$|R
50|$|Under the Skin was jointly {{financed by}} Film4 Productions, the British Film Institute, Scottish Screen, Silver Reel, and FilmNation Entertainment. Glazer secured final backing after cutting the {{elaborate}} special effects {{scenes from the}} script. The crew built their own cameras to shoot some scenes. To create the black room in which the character traps men, the crew built a bespoke set with a reflective floor, <b>blackout,</b> and custom <b>lighting.</b> The actors were filmed walking into a pool whose floor sank as they walked, submerging them. The scenes were finished with computer graphics.|$|R
