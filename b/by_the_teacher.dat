5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> bringing {{the back of his}} right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E

25|$|State {{schools are}} {{generally}} seen as equivalent in {{quality of education}} to private-sector institutions.

Cypriot universities (like universities in Greece) ignore high school grades almost entirely for admissions purposes.

25|$|The pentatonic scale plays a {{significant}} role in music education, particularly in Orff-based, Kodály-based, and Waldorf methodologies at the primary or elementary level. The Orff system places a heavy emphasis on developing creativity through improvisation in children, largely through use of the pentatonic scale. Orff instruments, such as xylophones, bells and other metallophones, use wooden bars, metal bars or bells, which can be removed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> leaving only those corresponding to the pentatonic scale, which Carl Orff himself believed to be children's native tonality. Children begin improvising using only these bars, and over time, more bars are added at the teacher's discretion until the complete diatonic scale is being used. Orff believed that the use of the pentatonic scale {{at such a young age}} was appropriate to the development of each child, since the nature of the scale meant that it was impossible for the child to make any real harmonic mistakes.|$|E

40|$|Aims: Considering {{individual}} differences and different learning styles in the learners {{is necessary in}} more effective learning. If the used learning style may be fully correspond with the students’ preffered style, {{there is a better}} learning performance. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the conformity of the students’ learning styles with educational media and technologies used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Instrument & Methods: In the descriptive-correlational study, 90 medicine and dentistry students of Isfahan University were randomly selected via Stratified Sampling method in 2014 - 15 academic year. The study tool was a researcher-made questionnaire to investigate the learning styles and technologies used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers.</b> Data was analyzed in SPSS 22 software using Hotelling’s T test, and Somers’, Kendall’s, and Gamma Agreement Coefficients. Findings: From the students’ viewpoints, visual and auditory styles were the most and the least preffered styles, respectively. A combination of the technologies was used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers.</b> In addition, visual and kinesthetic/motion mediae were the most and the least used technologies <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers,</b> respectively. There was no significant conformity between read/write, aural, and kinesthetic/motion styles of the students and <b>the</b> technologies used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> (p> 0. 05). Neverheless, there was a significant conformity between the students’ visual style and the visual technologies used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: There is conformity between <b>the</b> technologies used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and the students’ viual learning style.

500|$|In 1930 he {{enrolled}} at the École des Beaux-Arts in Antananarivo. The following year he transferred to the illustrious Paul Minault middle school, a private Protestant institution that had {{earned a reputation as}} a center for intellectual and creative excellence, partly because the school featured well-known thought leaders like nationalist poet Pastor Ravelojaona among their teaching staff. Its reputation also derived from its innovative teaching methods, based on individual reading and research, followed by debates guided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher.</b> This focus on reading allowed Razakandrainy to discover a range of French novelists, among whom his favorites were Victor Hugo, Alfred de Musset, Charles Baudelaire, and Albert Samain.

500|$|An inquest into Shaw's death {{commenced}} in Exeter {{shortly after}} her death was reported to the coroner.

During the meeting, the group asked to end the training hike early, but they were instructed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> to carry on. However, the group's navigator gave evidence that she and Shaw had been happy to continue the expedition. The possibility was also raised by other group members that the group was under-prepared for the conditions they faced.

We were told how to check how deep it was but we were never told how to cross them. Nobody ever talked to us about using ropes".|$|E

2500|$|Classical {{educators}} {{consider the}} Socratic method {{to be the}} best technique for teaching critical thinking. [...] In-class discussion and critiques are essential in order for students to recognize and internalize critical thinking techniques. [...] This method is widely used to teach both philosophy and law. [...] It is currently rare in other contexts. [...] Basically, the teacher referees the students' discussions, asks leading questions, and may refer to facts, but never gives a conclusion until at least one student reaches that conclusion. [...] The learning is most effective when the students compete strongly, even viciously in the argument, but always according to well-accepted rules of correct reasoning.

2500|$|However, the {{classification}} of madaris as [...] "universities" [...] is disputed {{on the question of}} understanding of each institution on its own terms. In madaris, the ijāzahs were only issued in one field, the Islamic religious law of , and in no other field of learning. Other academic subjects, including the natural sciences, philosophy and literary studies, were only treated [...] "ancillary" [...] {{to the study of the}} Sharia. For example, a natural science like astronomy was only studied (if at all) to supply religious needs, like the time for prayer. This is why Ptolemaic astronomy was considered adequate, and is still taught in some modern day madaris. The Islamic law undergraduate degree from al-Azhar, the most prestigious madrasa, was traditionally granted without final examinations, but on the basis of the students' attentive attendance to courses. In contrast to the medieval doctorate which was granted by the collective authority of the faculty, the Islamic degree was not granted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> to the pupil based on any formal criteria, but remained a [...] "personal matter, the sole prerogative of the person bestowing it; no one could force him to give one".|$|E
2500|$|Poverty affects {{individual}} {{access to}} quality education. The U.S. education system is often funded by local communities; therefore {{the quality of}} materials and teachers can reflect the affluence of community. That said, many communities address this by supplementing these areas with funds from other districts. Low income communities are often not able to afford the quality education that high income communities do. Poor perceptions, by teachers, of families and communities in poverty can manifest itself in teachers who will not put forth the effort to teach and students who {{are thought to be}} opposed to learning; in both cases poor students are thought to be incapable. When a teacher assumes a child is linguistically deficient, they may look through a stigmatized lens when working with the student. This can create an atmosphere that can reify negative stereotypes and undermine student motivation. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> not looking through such a lens, {{they will be able to}} reinforce the idea that all their students have an opportunity to increase their learning abilities, which can result in more classroom engagement and student motivation. Females in poverty are also likely to become pregnant at a young age, and with fewer resources to care for a child, young women often drop out of school. [...] A reason for the gap in access to education is due to the fact that reforms in the instruction programs have not been implemented well or at all in high poverty schools. Due to these and other reasons the quality of education between the classes is not equal.|$|E
