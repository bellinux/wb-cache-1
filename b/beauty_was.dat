5|$|American <b>Beauty</b> <b>was</b> not {{considered}} an immediate favorite {{to dominate the}} American awards season. Several other contenders opened {{at the end of}} 1999, and US critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end-of-year lists. The Chicago Film Critics Association and the Broadcast Film Critics Association named the film the best of 1999, but while the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association recognized American Beauty, they gave their top awards to other films. By the end of the year, reports of a critical backlash suggested American <b>Beauty</b> <b>was</b> the underdog in the race for Best Picture; however, at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2000, American Beauty won Best Film, Best Director and Best Screenplay.|$|E
5|$|Black <b>Beauty</b> <b>was</b> first {{released}} only in Japan by CBS/Sony in 1973 without individual songs {{specified in}} the track listing. Columbia Records, Davis' American record label, had difficulty identifying the compositions for royalty purposes, and the album was not released in the United States until 1997. Critics were generally positive toward Black Beauty, although some were critical of its sound quality and Grossman's solos; Corea said the recording was an accurate document how that particular band of Davis' played live.|$|E

5|$|Black <b>Beauty</b> <b>was</b> {{recorded}} on April 10, 1970, at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, when Davis performed as the opening act for the Grateful Dead. It was also {{soon after his}} studio album Bitches Brew had been released to stores, and he played some songs from the album while leading an ensemble that featured soprano saxophonist Steve Grossman, bassist Dave Holland, keyboardist Chick Corea, drummer Jack DeJohnette, and percussionist Airto Moreira. After the departure of saxophonist Wayne Shorter from the group earlier that year, Grossman was enlisted by Davis {{to participate in an}} April 7 recording session for his next album Jack Johnson (1971) before joining the live band.|$|E
5|$|Kanhopatra {{was trained}} in dance and song from early {{childhood}} {{so that she}} could join her mother's profession. She became a talented dancer and singer. Her <b>beauty</b> <b>was</b> compared to the apsara (heavenly nymph) Menaka. Shama suggested that Kanhopatra should visit the Badshah (Muslim king), who will adore her beauty and gift her money and jewelry, but Kanhopatra flatly refused. Traditional tales narrate that Shama wanted Kanhopatra to marry, but Kanhopatra longed to marry a man who was more beautiful than her. Scholar Tara Bhavalkar states that Kanhopatra's marriage was forbidden, as it was not socially acceptable for a daughter of a courtesan to marry.|$|E
5|$|Released in North America on September17, 1999, American <b>Beauty</b> <b>was</b> {{positively}} {{received by}} critics and grossed over $356million worldwide. Reviewers praised most {{aspects of the}} production, with particular emphasis on Mendes, Spacey, and Ball; criticism focused on the familiarity of the characters and setting. DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase the film's chances of Academy Award success; at the 72nd Academy Awards the following year, the film won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (for Spacey), Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography. It was nominated for and won many other awards and honors, mainly for the direction, writing, and acting.|$|E

5000|$|For Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten {{aesthetics}} is {{the science}} of the sense experiences, a younger sister of logic, and <b>beauty</b> <b>is</b> thus the most perfect kind of knowledge that sense experience can have. For Immanuel Kant the aesthetic experience of <b>beauty</b> <b>is</b> a judgment of a subjective but similar human truth, since all people should agree that [...] "this rose is beautiful" [...] if it in fact <b>is.</b> However, <b>beauty</b> cannot <b>be</b> reduced to any more basic set of features. For Friedrich Schiller aesthetic appreciation of <b>beauty</b> <b>is</b> the most perfect reconciliation of the sensual and rational parts of human nature.|$|R

5|$|When Sleeping <b>Beauty</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in 1959, {{the film was}} both a critical and commercial failure, discouraging the studio from adapting fairy tales into animated films for decades. Aurora herself received negative reviews for her passivity and overall similarity to Snow White. Aurora would remain Disney's last princess until The Little Mermaids Ariel debuted 30 years later in 1989. However, Costa's vocal performance was praised, which inspired her to pursue a full-time career as an opera singer to great success. Chronologically, Aurora is the third Disney Princess. Despite having since established herself as a popular character for her beauty and fashion, Aurora's personality continues to receive negative press, particularly from feminist critics, thus earning her {{a reputation as one}} of Disney's most passive princess characters. Actress Elle Fanning portrays a live-action version of Aurora in the film Maleficent (2014), a retelling of Sleeping Beauty from the perspective of its villain.|$|E

50|$|It was {{apparent}} that the mere distinction between concrete substance and concrete quality was not a sufficient basis for logic. Socrates in the Hippias Major had pointed out problems in Anaxagoras' approach, explaining all attributes through their presence in a body in the way one body may be contained in another. In that dialog, Hippias tried to explain beauty to Socrates.

40|$|Health and <b>beauty</b> <b>are</b> {{the most}} {{important}} physical ideals. This paper seeks to compare and contrast these ideals, based on a value theory of human abilities.

Physical <b>beauty</b> <b>is</b> the implicit symbolic expression of mental and physical health.
