5|$|The Russian system {{differed}} from the <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>American</b> systems in its relationship with indigenous peoples. Using the same method they had used in Siberia, the Russians employed or enserfed Aleut and Alutiiq people, the latter being a subgroup of the Yupik Eskimo people. The Aleut and Alutiiq people were expert sea otter hunters, noted for their use of kayaks and baidarkas. Russian ships were mainly used for transporting and assisting native hunting parties. This {{differed from}} the <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>American</b> system, where the natives hunted sea otters and prepared the furs on their own, and were essentially independent agents of the fur trade. The Russians did not trade freely with the native Alaskans; rather, they imposed a fur tribute known as yasak. The yasak system, which was widely used in Siberia, essentially enslaved the natives. In 1788, it was banned in Russian America, only {{to be replaced by}} compulsory labor.|$|E

5|$|Bodyguard of Lies is a 1975 non-fiction {{book written}} by Anthony Cave Brown, {{his first major}} {{historical}} work.

50|$|To the {{annoyance}} of the <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>Americans,</b> Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek ordered Sultan to halt his advance at Lashio, which was captured on 7 March.

The Japanese had already withdrawn most of their divisions from the northern front, to face Fourteenth Army in central Burma. On 12 March, Thirty-third Army HQ was also dispatched there, leaving only the 56th Division to hold the northern front. This division was also withdrawn in late March and early April.|$|R

The corps moved to Cassino, the defenders of which had resisted American forces for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} 19th and 20th centuries, the United Kingdom largely {{used the}} long scale, whereas the United States used the short scale, so that the two systems were often {{referred}} to as <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>American</b> in the English language. After several decades of increasing informal British usage of the short scale, in 1974 the government of the UK adopted it, and it is used for all official purposes. With very few exceptions, the British usage and American usage are now identical.|$|E

5|$|For the Papuan Campaign, MacArthur awarded Blamey the American Distinguished Service Cross, and Blamey {{was created}} a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire on 28 May 1943.

The large numbers of <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>American</b> cemeteries and memorials, particularly in the Ardennes region associated with the Battle of the Bulge, meant that the legacy of the war was very visible.|$|E
