25|$|Currencies are traded {{against one}} another in pairs. Each {{currency}} pair thus constitutes an individual trading product and is traditionally noted XXXYYY or XXX/YYY, where XXX and YYY are the ISO 4217 international three-letter code of the currencies involved. The first currency (XXX) is the <b>base</b> <b>currency</b> that is quoted relative to the second currency (YYY), called the counter currency (or quote currency). For instance, the quotation EURUSD (EUR/USD) 1.5465 {{is the price of}} the Euro expressed in US dollars, meaning 1 euro = 1.5465 dollars. The market convention is to quote most exchange rates against the USD with the US dollar as the <b>base</b> <b>currency</b> (e.g. USDJPY, USDCAD, USDCHF). The exceptions are the British pound (GBP), Australian dollar (AUD), the New Zealand dollar (NZD) and the euro (EUR) where the USD is the counter currency (e.g. GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, EURUSD).|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the implications of}} the choice of numeraire currency on panel tests of Purchasing Power Parity under the current regime of flexible exchange rates by conducting panel unit root tests with twenty-one different <b>base</b> <b>currencies.</b> We show that the conditions necessary for numeraire irrelevancy are not supported empirically, and that the choice of numeraire currency can and does matter for PPP. The evidence of PPP is stronger for European than for non-European <b>base</b> <b>currencies.</b> Distance between the countries and volatility of the exchange rates are the most important determinants of the results...|$|R
40|$|This article {{compares the}} {{stability}} of interrelationships among nine national equity markets by employing basket <b>currencies</b> versus individual <b>base</b> <b>currencies</b> to measure rates of return. We show that the average correlations of equity indexes <b>based</b> on basket <b>currencies</b> are {{much lower than the}} average correlations of equity indexes based on individual home <b>base</b> <b>currencies.</b> Additionally, empirical directed graph results from using basket currencies are more consistent with each other than the results from using different individual currencies. We conclude that basket currencies provide more robust results for studying equity market comovements than individual currencies. By implication, studies on equity market interrelationships, including studies on potential financial contagion between equity markets, should use basket currencies to avoid currency dependent results. ...|$|R

2500|$|For a {{persistent}} world {{to maintain a}} stable economy, a balance must be struck between currency sources and sinks. Generally, games possess numerous sources of new currency for players to earn. [...] However, some possess no effective [...] "sinks", or methods of removing currency from circulation. [...] If other factors remain constant, greater currency supply weakens the buying power of a given amount; {{a process known as}} inflation.

We employ error correction models for single countries and {{on the level of}} pooled equations allowing efficient inference on domestic and foreign price elasticities of nominal exchange rates. Likelihood ratio tests are applied to infer on linear restrictions implied by the economic relationship. Critical values for these tests are estimated by means of the wild bootstrap that copes with heterogeneous error distributions and contemporaneous correlation within a pooled system of single equations. Furthermore, the tests are performed recursively in order {{to address the issue of}} time dependence of our results.

50|$|Managed {{currency}} mortgages {{can help}} to reduce risk exposure. A borrower can allow a specialist currency manager to manage their loan on their behalf (through a limited power of attorney), where the currency manager will switch the borrower's debt {{in and out of}} foreign currencies as they change in value against the <b>base</b> <b>currency.</b> A successful currency manager will move the borrower's debt into a currency which subsequently falls in value against the <b>base</b> <b>currency.</b> The manager can then switch the loan back into the <b>base</b> <b>currency</b> (or another weakening currency) at a better exchange rate, thereby reducing the value of the loan. A further benefit of this product is that the currency manager will try to select currencies with a lower interest rate than the <b>base</b> <b>currency,</b> and the borrower therefore can make substantial interest savings.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} an active {{currency}} overlay program is to vary currency hedge ratios over time depending upon the macroeconomic and financial market circumstances prevailing at any time.

The quotation EUR/USD 1.2500 means that one euro is exchanged for 1.2500 US dollars. Here, EUR is the <b>base</b> <b>currency</b> and USD is the quote currency(counter currency).

50|$|Sometimes {{the term}} <b>base</b> <b>{{currency}}</b> may also {{refer to the}} currency of a bank or company; usually their domestic currency.

If a EUR/USD position is closed out with a profit in USD by a British bank, then the rate-to-base will be expressed as a GBP/USD rate. This ambiguity leads many market participants to use the expressions currency 1 (CCY1) and currency 2 (CCY2), where one unit of CCY1 equals the quoted number of units of CCY2.|$|E
