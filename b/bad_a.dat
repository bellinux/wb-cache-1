25|$|The orbifold {{is said to}} be {{developable}} or good if it arises as the quotient by {{a finite}} group action; otherwise it is called <b>bad.</b> <b>A</b> universal covering orbifold can be constructed for an orbifold by direct analogy with the construction of the universal covering space of a topological space, namely as the space of pairs consisting of points of the orbifold and homotopy classes of orbifold paths joining them to the basepoint.

25|$|The {{keyboard}} LED uses blink codes: one blink {{means the}} keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure. Using Caps Lock key {{and getting a}} response means CIA and the CPU works. There {{is no guarantee that}} every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer has some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is <b>bad,</b> <b>a</b> connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so {{there is no guarantee that}} any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.|$|E

500|$|The {{east side}} of the castle was badly damaged in an {{explosion}} in August 1759, caused after cooking sparks fell onto gunpowder stored in the castle by the 72nd Regiment of Foot; 17 men, women and children were killed.

By the second half of the century, the castle was in poor condition and, according to one contemporary account, only garrisoned by [...] "an old sergeant and three or four men who sell cakes and ale". The Master–General of the Ordnance, Charles Lennox, the Duke of Richmond, reported in 1785 that it was [...] "of too <b>bad</b> <b>a</b> form to deserve the expense necessary to repair it" [...] and proposed building a more modern fort along the coast instead.

500|$|When it {{came time}} to record a lead single, Yankovic once again turned his {{attention}} to Michael Jackson. Jackson had just released his album <b>Bad,</b> <b>a</b> follow-up to 1983's immensely successful album Thriller. After Yankovic first heard the lead single, [...] "Bad", he immediately envisioned a parody entitled [...] "Fat". Initially, Yankovic didn't want to record another Michael Jackson parody. He later said, [...] "I was still primarily known as the 'Eat It' guy and I didn't want to become known as the guy who just rides Michael's coattails." [...] He later relented and sought out Jackson for permission. Jackson, a fan of Yankovic's work, had already let Yankovic parody his 1983 hit single [...] "Beat It". When presented with the new potential parody, Jackson not only approved it, but let Yankovic use his own Moonwalker subway set for the music video. Yankovic later presented Jackson with a gold record of Even Worse after the album sold over 500,000 copies.

500|$|Fellini was {{a notorious}} perfectionist, {{and this could}} be trying for his cast.

Quinn also recalled being particularly proud of a certain scene in which his performance had earned applause from onlookers on the set, only to receive {{a phone call from}} Fellini late that night informing him {{that they would have to}} re-do the entire sequence because Quinn had been too good: [...] "You see, you're supposed to be a <b>bad,</b> <b>a</b> terrible actor, but the people watching applauded you. They should have laughed at you. So in the morning we do it again." [...] As for Masina, Fellini insisted that she re-create the thin-lipped smile he had seen in her childhood photographs. He cut her hair by putting a bowl on her head and shearing off anything that wasn't covered up, afterwards plastering what remained with soap to give it a [...] "spiky, untidy look", then [...] "flicked talc into her face to give it the pallor of a kabuki performer."

500|$|This {{episode is}} one of very few {{that focuses on the}} {{religious}} aspects of the Futurama universe. In most episodes, it is indicated that the Planet Express crew, along with most beings in the year 3000, are [...] "remarkably unreligious". [...] It introduces two of the religious figures of Futurama, The Robot Devil and Reverend Lionel Preacherbot, both of whom make appearances in later episodes. Preacherbot, who speaks in a manner typical of inner-city African-American pastor stereotypes, converts Bender to the religion Robotology. This leads to a series of events that are similar in many ways to the experiences of real world religious converts. Mark Pinsky states that the episode has a [...] "double-edged portrayal of religion" [...] as it portrays both an improvement in Bender's character but also some of the [...] "less pleasant characteristics of the newly pious". The Robot Devil is introduced after Bender's fall back into sin. Pinsky writes in The Gospel According to The Simpsons, that while explaining to Bender his claim on his soul, the Robot Devil uses logic similar to that used by many Southern Baptists: [...] "Bender tried to plead his case, without success. 'You agreed to this when you joined our religion,' the devil replies, in logic any Southern Baptist would recognize. 'You sin, you go to robot hell— for all eternity." [...] By the end of the episode, Bender has returned to his old ways and states that he will no longer try to be either too good or too <b>bad,</b> <b>a</b> parody and contradiction of the Book of Revelation statement that one should not be lukewarm in his faith.|$|E

500|$|McCain reached Hỏa Lò in as <b>bad</b> <b>a</b> {{physical}} condition as any prisoner during the war. His captors {{refused to give}} him medical care unless he gave them military information; they beat and interrogated him, but McCain only offered his name, rank, serial number, and date of birth (the only information he was required to provide under the Geneva Conventions and permitted to give under the U.S. Code of Conduct). Soon thinking he was near death, McCain said he would give them more information if taken to the hospital, hoping he could then put his interrogators off once he was treated. A prison doctor came {{and said it was}} too late, as McCain was about to die anyway. Only when the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was a high-ranking admiral did they give him medical care, calling him [...] "the crown prince". [...] Two days after McCain's plane went down, that event and his status as a POW made the front pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post. Interrogation and beatings resumed in the hospital; McCain gave the North Vietnamese his ship's name, squadron's name, and the attack's intended target. This information, along with personal details of McCain's life and purported statements by McCain about the war's progress, would appear over the next two weeks in the North Vietnamese official newspaper Nhân Dân as well as in dispatches from outlets such as the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina. [...] Disclosing the military information was in violation of the Code of Conduct, which McCain later wrote he regretted, although he saw the information as being of no practical use to the North Vietnamese. Further coerced to give future targets, he named cities that had already been bombed, and responding to demands for the names of his squadron's members, he supplied instead the names of the Green Bay Packers' offensive line.|$|E
