5|$|Winemakers {{can also}} control the {{influence}} of oak by using alternatives to the standard barrique <b>barrels.</b> Larger <b>barrels</b> have a smaller wood-to-wine ratio and therefore less pronounced oak flavors. Winemakers in Italy and Portugal sometimes use <b>barrels</b> made from other wood types such as chestnut and redwood. Another method that winemakers consider is tea bagging with oak chips or adding oak planks to the wines while fermenting or aging it in stainless steel tanks. While these methods are less costly than oak <b>barrels,</b> they create more pronounced oak flavors, which tend not to mellow or integrate {{with the rest of}} the wine's components; nor do they provide the gradual oxidation benefit of barrel aging.|$|E
5|$|In all 50,000 flame fougasse <b>barrels</b> were {{distributed}} {{of which the}} great majority were installed in 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Some <b>barrels</b> were held in reserve while others were deployed at storage sites to destroy petrol depots at short notice. The size of a battery varied from just one drum {{to as many as}} fourteen; a four barrel battery was the most common installation and the recommended minimum. Where possible, half the <b>barrels</b> in a battery were to contain the 40/60 mixture and half the sticky 5B mixture.|$|E

5|$|After {{years of}} failed {{attempts}} to extract {{oil from the}} salt domes near Beaumont, a small enterprise known as the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company was joined in 1899 by Croatian/Austrian mechanical engineer Anthony F. Lucas, an expert in salt domes. Lucas joined the company {{in response to the}} numerous ads the company's founder Pattillo Higgins placed in industrial magazines and trade journals. Lucas and his colleagues struggled for two years to find oil at a location known as Spindletop Hill before making a strike in 1901. The new well produced approximately 100,000 <b>barrels</b> of oil per day, an unprecedented level of production at the time. The 1902 total annual production at Spindletop exceeded 17 million <b>barrels.</b> The state's total production in 1900 had been only 836,000 <b>barrels.</b> The overabundance of supply led oil prices in the U.S. to drop to a record low of 3 cents per barrel, less than the price of water in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Both methods offered {{advantages}} and disadvantages, though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear. As guns fire, their <b>barrels</b> wear out, losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement. At times, this became problematic; the US Navy seriously considered stopping practice firing of heavy guns in 1910 {{because of the}} wear on the <b>barrels.</b> The disadvantages of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier; and heavier shells, which are fired at lower velocities, require turret designs that allow a larger angle of elevation for the same range. Heavier shells {{have the advantage of}} being slowed less by air resistance, retaining more penetrating power at longer ranges.|$|E
5|$|Documentation {{indicated}} that the missing uranium {{had been sent to}} Toulouse. An Alsos Mission team under Boris Pash's command reached Toulouse on October 1 and inspected a French Army arsenal with a Geiger counter. When the needle jumped near some <b>barrels,</b> they were inspected and found to be the 31 tons of uranium from Belgium. The 3342nd Quartermaster Truck Company was released from the Red Ball Express to retrieve the shipment. The <b>barrels</b> were collected and transported to Marseilles, where Furman supervised their loading on a ship bound for the United States.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{includes}} {{a study on}} the surface treatments of the <b>barrel</b> of small arms with an aim at improving resistance of corrosion and wear. The inner surface of the <b>barrel</b> is Cr plated or nitrided to improve the performance under the firing. The endurance test was conducted to compare the wear resistance of standard <b>barrel</b> (the non surface treatment <b>barrel),</b> the Cr plating <b>barrel</b> and the nitriding <b>barrel.</b> The wear resistance is evaluated by inner diameter of the <b>barrel,</b> muzzle velocity and dispersion during the firing. And the salt water immersion test was conducted to estimate the corrosion resistance. As the results of the tests, the Cr plating <b>barrel</b> is superior to the NST <b>barrel</b> and the nitriding <b>barrel</b> in a view of corrosion and wear...|$|R

5|$|In 1951, exports totalled 90,000 <b>barrels,</b> but by 1964 {{had grown}} to 300,000 <b>barrels.</b> By 1959, sales in Ghana had grown large enough for Guinness to {{establish}} a joint venture {{in the country with}} the United Africa Company. By 1962, Nigeria had become the largest export market for Guinness, with around 100,000 <b>barrels</b> exported to the country every year. This led the company to build a brewery in Ikeja in western Nigeria to supply the demand; it was only the third brewery in the company's history. The brewery cost over £2 million, had a 150,000 barrel capacity, and was 60 per cent owned by Guinness Nigeria, 25 per cent by the United Africa Company with the remaining shares held by local Nigerian interests. Breweries followed in Malaysia (1965), Cameroon (1970) and Ghana (1971), whilst licences were granted to other companies to brew Guinness under contract in other African countries and the West Indies. Historically a small proportion of Guinness production, it was this success, especially in Africa but also in Asia, that allowed FES to grow into a 4.5 million hectolitre brand.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>barrel</b> plug is {{a plastic}} or rubber plug that fits snugly into the muzzle {{end of the}} marker's <b>barrel,</b> like a wine cork. If made of plastic, they {{generally}} incorporate one or more rubber o-rings to provide friction against the <b>barrel</b> surface. These were the original and universal form of <b>barrel</b> block before {{the introduction of the}} <b>barrel</b> sock, but are now generally eschewed by players and fields in favor of <b>barrel</b> socks. When using a <b>barrel</b> plug, if a paintball is fired, it will break against the plug in the <b>barrel,</b> lining the <b>barrel</b> with paint and drastically affecting accuracy until the <b>barrel</b> can be squeegeed. <b>Barrel</b> plugs can also be hard to remove and install properly; the high friction that keeps the plug in place when needed also inhibits its intentional removal. The force of the paintball impacting against the plug is often enough to dislodge it; with modern electronic markers having [...] "automatic" [...] and [...] "burst" [...] modes of fire, a single pull of the trigger may be enough to expel the <b>barrel</b> plug from the <b>barrel,</b> which can cause injury in itself, and also exposes those nearby to any further shots leaving the <b>barrel</b> after the plug has been expelled. <b>Barrel</b> plugs, therefore, are not an absolute safety against accidental marker discharge and eye injury.|$|R
50|$|Full contact bedding of {{the action}} with the <b>barrel</b> floated is a very common method for long range rifles with a heavy <b>barrel.</b> A {{free-floating}} <b>barrel</b> will generally produce the greatest accuracy. However, a pressure pad under the <b>barrel</b> just forward {{of the action}} can sometimes improve accuracy by acting on <b>barrel</b> harmonics and reducing stress on the action from {{the weight of the}} <b>barrel.</b> Pillar bedding can be used to float the action as well as the <b>barrel,</b> but the process is more difficult.|$|R

5|$|James Livingston had {{advanced}} to Montgomery {{the idea of}} taking Fort Chambly, near where his militia was encamped. One of Livingston's captains, Jeremy Duggan, had, on September 13, floated two nine-pound guns past St. Jean, and these guns were put to use to that end. Chambly, which was garrisoned by only 82 men, mostly from the 7th Foot, was surrendered on October 18 by its commander, Major Joseph Stopford, after two days of bombardment. Most seriously, Stopford failed to destroy supplies that were vitally useful to the Americans, primarily gunpowder, but also winter provisions. Six tons of powder, 6,500 musket cartridges, 125 muskets, 80 <b>barrels</b> of flour and 272 <b>barrels</b> of foodstuff were captured.|$|E

50|$|A <b>barrel</b> shroud is a {{covering}} {{attached to the}} <b>barrel</b> of a firearm, that partially or completely encircles the <b>barrel</b> which prevents operators from injuring themselves on a hot <b>barrel.</b> Slides, extensions of the stock that do not fully encircle the <b>barrel,</b> and the receiver (or frame) of a firearm itself are generally not described as <b>barrel</b> shrouds, though they in fact do act as such. <b>Barrel</b> shrouds are commonly featured on air-cooled machine guns, where sustained rapid or automatic fire leave the <b>barrel</b> extremely hot and dangerous to the operator. However, shrouds {{can also be utilized}} on semi-automatic firearms, as even a small number of shots can heat up a <b>barrel</b> enough to injure an operator in certain circumstances.|$|R
