Such stigmatization may be both real and perceived; for example, in Ghana individuals with TB are banned from attending public gatherings.|$|E

5|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Homunculus {{is the ability to}} measure the {{spectrum}} of the central object at different latitudes by the reflected spectrum from different portions of the lobes. These clearly show a polar wind where the stellar wind is faster and stronger at high latitudes thought to <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to rapid rotation causing gravity brightening towards the poles. In contrast the spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to the equatorial plane. By implication the outer envelope of Eta Carinae A is not strongly convective as that would prevent the gravity darkening. The current axis of rotation of the star does not appear to exactly match the alignment of the Homunculus. This may <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to interaction with Eta Carinae B which also modifies the observed stellar winds.|$|E
