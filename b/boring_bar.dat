40|$|Nowadays, the {{availability}} of reliable mathematical models of machining system dynamics is a key issue for achieving high quality standards in precision machining. Dynamic models can indeed be applied for tooling system design, preventive evaluation of cutting process stability and optimization of cutting parameters. This is of particular concern in internal turning, where the cutting process is greatly affected by the compliance of the tooling system. In this paper, an innovative hybrid dynamic model of the tooling system in internal turning, based on FE beams and empirical models, is presented. The model was based on physical and geometrical assumptions and it was refined by using experimental observations derived from modal testing of <b>boring</b> <b>bars</b> with different geometries and made of different materials, i. e. alloy steel and high-damping carbide. The predicted modal parameters of the tooling system (tool tip static compliance, natural frequency and damping coefficient of the dominant mode) are in good accordance with experimental values...|$|R

The head can be shifted left or right with fine gradation by a screw, adjusting the diameter of the circle that the cutting tip swings through, thus controlling the hole size, even down to within 10 micrometres if all machining conditions are good.|$|E
50|$|Lathe boring usually {{requires}} that the workpiece {{be held in the}} chuck and rotated. As the workpiece is rotated, a <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> with an insert attached to the tip of the bar is fed into an existing hole. When the cutting tool engages the workpiece, a chip is formed. Depending on the type of tool used, the material, and the feed rate, the chip may be continuous or segmented. The surface produced is called a bore.|$|E
5000|$|Because boring {{is meant}} to {{decrease}} the product tolerances on pre-existing holes, several design considerations apply. First, large length-to-bore-diameters are not preferred due to cutting tool deflection. Next, through holes are preferred over blind holes (holes that do not traverse {{the thickness of the}} work piece). Interrupted internal working surfaces—where the cutting tool and surface have discontinuous contact—are preferably avoided. The <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> is the protruding arm of the machine that holds the cutting tool(s), and must be very rigid.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are various}} types of boring. The <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> may be {{supported}} on both ends (which only works if the existing hole is a through hole), {{or it may be}} supported at one end (which works for both through holes and blind holes). Lineboring (line boring, line-boring) implies the former. Backboring (back boring, back-boring) is the process of reaching through an existing hole and then boring on the [...] "back" [...] side of the workpiece (relative to the machine headstock).|$|E
50|$|The {{boring process}} can be {{executed}} on various machine tools, including (1) general-purpose or universal machines, such as lathes (/turning centers) or milling machines (/machining centers), and (2) machines designed to specialize in boring as a primary function, such as jig borers and boring machines or boring mills, which include vertical boring mills (workpiece rotates around a vertical axis while boring bar/head moves linearly; essentially a vertical lathe) and horizontal boring mills (workpiece sits on a table while the <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> rotates around a horizontal axis; essentially a specialized horizontal milling machine).|$|E

50|$|A <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> {{is a tool}} used in {{metalworking}} and woodworking. Boring is a technique used in many aspects of building. Woodworkers have used boring {{as a form of}} drilling for centuries. In woodworking, the boring tool is static in size and used to form circular plunge cuts. In metalworking, boring is slightly different in that the hole that results need not be circular. In metal boring the tool can be plunged and dragged on the X or Y axes to create a slot or asymmetrical hole or channel, or it may be moved only in an up-and-down motion (on the Z axis) to create a perfect circular hole.|$|E
40|$|<b>Boring</b> <b>bar</b> {{vibration}} in {{machine tools}} during internal turning operations is a pronounced {{problem in the}} manufacturing industry. Due to the often slender geometry of the <b>boring</b> <b>bar,</b> vibration may easily be induced by the material deformation process. One approach to overcome such vibration problems is to use active control of <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> vibration. The design time of an active <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> depends {{to a great extent}} on the knowledge of its dynamic properties when clamped in a lathe for different actuator positions and sizes, crucial for its performance. This thesis focuses on the development of accurate dynamic models of active boring bars with the purpose of providing qualitative information on suitable actuator position for a certain <b>boring</b> <b>bar.</b> The first part of the thesis considers the problem of building an accurate " 3 -D" finite element (FE) model of a standard <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> used in industry. Results from experimental modal analysis of the actual <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> are the reference. The second and the third parts discuss analytical and experimental methods for modeling the dynamic properties of a <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> clamped in a machine tool. For this purpose, the Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories are used to produce both distributed-parameter system models and corresponding " 1 -D" FE models. A more complete " 3 -D" FE model of the system <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> - clamping house is also developed. Spatial dynamic properties of these models are discussed and compared with adequate experimental modal analysis results from the actual <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> clamped in a machine tool. The third part also investigates the sensitivity of the spatial dynamic properties of the derived <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> models to variation in the structural parameters' values. The fourth part focuses on the development of a " 3 -D" FE model of the system <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> - actuator - clamping house. Two models are discussed: a linear model and a model enabling variable contact between the clamping house and the <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> with and without Coulomb friction in the contact surfaces. Based on these FE models fundamental bending modes and control path frequency response functions are discussed in conjunction with the corresponding quantities estimated for the actual active <b>boring</b> <b>bar.</b> In the fifth part, a method based on FE modeling and artificial neural networks for selecting a suitable actuator position inside an active <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> is presented. Objective functions for selecting an actuator position are suggested. An active <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> with an actuator position suggested by the method was manufactured and it displays fairly good correlation with the corresponding FE model. The final part focuses on modeling of an active <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> vibration control system. A simple " 1 -D" FE model of a <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> is utilized to simulate the dynamic response and an adaptive digital feedback controller realized by the feedback filtered-x LMS algorithm is used...|$|E
40|$|The <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used type of tool holders in metal cutting operations. The turning process {{subjects}} the tool to vibrations, and cutting in deep workpiece cavities is likely to result in high vibration levels. The consequences of such vibration levels generally results in: reduced tool life, poor surface finishing and disturbing sound. Internal turning frequently requires a long and slender <b>boring</b> <b>bar</b> in order to machine inside a cavity, and the vibrations generally become highly correlated with one of the fundamental bending modes of the <b>boring</b> <b>bar.</b> Different methods can be applied to reduce the vibrations, the implementation of the most efficient and stable methods require in depth knowledge concerning the dynamic properties of the tooling system.

40|$|International audienceThe {{vertical}} distribution of longshore sediment transport was measured on sandy macrotidal barred beaches of Northern France under low to moderate wave energy conditions, using streamer traps collecting sand at different elevations above the bed. Longshore sediment flux measurements and wave and current {{data were collected}} at several locations along cross-shore transects in order to analyse {{the relation between the}} vertical patterns of suspended sand transport and the forcing hydrodynamics across the bar-trough topography. Suspended sediment fluxes generally showed a typical upward decrease in longshore transport, revealing that near-bed transport represents the major transport mode on these macrotidal beaches, notably over the bars where the highest rates of sediment transport were measured. Conversely to previous studies in which the shape of the {{vertical distribution}} was either independent of the location in the surf zone or which showed an increase in suspended transport over intertidal bars, our results revealed a strong upward decrease in longshore sediment transport over bars, especially under higher wave energy conditions, whereas more uniform vertical distributions were observed in troughs. These differences in the vertical distribution of longshore sediment flux can be explained by spatially variable wave breaking and surf zone processes over the bar-trough topography and by the distribution of small-scale bedforms across the intertidal zone, which influence sand resuspension processes and control the shape of the vertical profiles of sediment transport. Larger longshore sediment fluxes over bars {{can be explained by the}} action of breaking waves that are responsible for increased sediment remobilization, but the dominance of spilling breakers on the studied beaches likely results in significant turbulence dissipation, leading to limited sand resuspension in the water column. Comparatively, landward propagating surf <b>bores</b> over <b>bars</b> favour an increase in sediment concentration at higher elevations above the bottom in the adjacent trough...|$|R
