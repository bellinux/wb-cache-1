5|$|In February 2001, {{the sale}} of bird seed in the square was stopped and other {{measures}} were introduced to discourage the pigeons {{including the use of}} birds of prey. Supporters continued to feed the birds but in 2003 the mayor, Ken Livingstone, enacted <b>bylaws</b> to ban feeding them in the square. In September 2007 Westminster City Council passed further <b>bylaws</b> banning feeding birds on the pedestrianised North Terrace and other pavements in the area. Nelson's column was repaired from years of damage from pigeon droppings at a cost of £140,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, {{the society}} {{presented}} a new code and system of <b>bylaws</b> {{for the government}} of the Romney Classical Institute, which reserved to the society the power to appoint assistant teachers, fix the amount of salaries, and provide the conditions and manners of payment and reimbursement. Foote differed with the society over these matters, and he ultimately declined to accept the new <b>bylaws</b> and resigned his leadership position in October 1849; in 1850, he established a rival institution known as the Potomac Seminary. Rather than falling under the patronage of the society, Foote's new institution fell {{under the control of the}} Presbyterian church. Following Foote's departure, the society selected Professor E. J. Meany to head the Romney Classical Institute. Despite the schism, the society also provided financial support from the lottery to the Potomac Seminary.|$|E

5000|$|The Town of Taber gained notoriety when it {{adopted a}} <b>bylaw</b> on February 23, 2015 that granted {{the police and}} <b>bylaw</b> {{officials}} the authority to levy fines for controversial actions including swearing, public assembly, spitting and applying graffiti on one's own private property. The <b>bylaw</b> also implemented a curfew. The adoption met criticism over its appearance of being unconstitutional; violating freedoms of expression and association protected under section two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The town defended its adoption stating the <b>bylaw</b> [...] "is intended to consolidate existing municipal regulations and allow enforcement under a municipal <b>bylaw</b> rather than the Criminal Code" [...] and citing concerns about unnecessary prosecutions clogging the court. Mayor Henk De Vlieger supported the <b>bylaw</b> while stating that town council will review the <b>bylaw</b> after a six-month trial.|$|R

The Finnish harness racing <b>bylaws</b> allow Finnhorses to be raced from ages 3 to 16.|$|E
5|$|Each {{local church}} {{operates}} {{according to its}} own <b>bylaws</b> and calls its own pastor. The office of pastor is equivalent to that of elder or overseer and is tasked with preaching and teaching the Word of God, in addition to conducting the day-to-day operations of the church. Laypersons are elected as a board of deacons to assist the pastor. A General Council affiliated church may withdraw from the Assemblies of God by a two-thirds vote of the church membership.|$|E
5|$|After the crisis, Unicamp saw {{a period}} of renewal and restructuring. In 1983 the <b>bylaws</b> were rewritten, {{ensuring}} {{the autonomy of the}} academic community, and the new management structure for the campus was implemented. In 1986 the newly created University Council replaces the previous Directive Council as the supreme body of the university. The last years of the 1980s saw a reformulation of the admissions exam, expansion of the laboratories and the completion of the first units of the student housing.|$|E
5000|$|On October 3, 2016, a Quebec judge {{temporarily}} {{suspended the}} pit bull ban {{part of the}} <b>bylaw.</b> Two days later the judge decided to extend the suspension {{on the grounds that}} the <b>bylaw</b> was too vague and imprecise, claiming that [...] "This court has the impression that certain articles of the <b>bylaw</b> were written in haste." [...] Coderre defended the <b>bylaw</b> by stating [...] "We didn't move too fast" [...] and he said: [...] "It's not a right to have a dog, it's a privilege."

50|$|For <b>bylaw</b> officers, this is {{generally}} good news, as {{it means that}} those persons who may be employed as <b>bylaw</b> officers without having been sworn under provincial acts are nonetheless protected under the Criminal Code definition of Peace Officer. This has somewhat convoluted the process of legally appointing <b>bylaw</b> officers. In British Columbia, for example, a person may be appointed as a <b>Bylaw</b> Officer through the Community Charter, which sets out different powers & responsibilities the Province of BC delegates to municipalities. However, the Provincial Police Act, which sets out various rules pertaining to police structure and administration in BC, also provides a mechanism for appointing <b>bylaw</b> officers.|$|R
5|$|Expansion on {{the campus}} {{continued}} rapidly, with new buildings, institutes and expansions being added nearly every year. But by the late 1970s, the university faced a crisis. During its fast expansion, it relied on draft <b>bylaws,</b> mostly borrowed from the University of São Paulo, and lacked formal internal regulations with the aging Zeferino Vaz, while no longer the rector, acting as a moderating force between parties with conflicting interests, in particular the leftist academic community and the State's government, appointed by the conservative military regime ruling the country.|$|E
5|$|From 1846 to 1849, the {{institute}} was operated {{under the direction}} of Presbyterian Reverend William Henry Foote, who had been a teacher and principal at Romney Academy. In 1849, when the Romney Literary Society established a new operating code for {{the institute}} and a new system of <b>bylaws,</b> Foote took offense and in 1850 founded a rival school, which was known as the Potomac Seminary. Professor E. J. Meany succeeded Foote, followed by John Jeremiah Jacob who served as the school's principal from 1851 to 1853. Jacob later served as West Virginia's first Democratic governor. Reverend Joseph Nelson later served as the school's principal until the American Civil War, and shortly after hostilities ended.|$|E
5|$|Reagan {{was first}} elected to the Board of Directors of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) in 1941, serving as an {{alternate}} member. After World War II, he resumed service and became third vice-president in 1946. The adoption of conflict-of-interest <b>bylaws</b> in 1947 led the SAG president and six board members to resign; Reagan was nominated in a special election for the position of president and was subsequently elected. He was chosen by the membership to serve seven additional one-year terms, from 1947 to 1952 and in 1959. Reagan led the SAG through eventful years that were marked by labor-management disputes, the Taft–Hartley Act, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings and the Hollywood blacklist era.|$|E

In August 2004 a controversial municipal <b>bylaw</b> went into effect that placed a 10:30 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. curfew on unsupervised children aged 15 and under. The controversial <b>bylaw</b> held parents responsible for their children's activities through fines if a child was caught in violation of the curfew. After parents filed a legal action to have the <b>bylaw</b> overturned, the Council suspended application of the <b>bylaw.</b>|$|R
5|$|The ACLU, {{which had}} been {{controlled}} by an elite of a few dozen New Yorkers, became more democratic in the 1950s. In 1951, the ACLU amended its <b>bylaws</b> to permit the local affiliates to participate directly in voting on ACLU policy decisions. A bi-annual conference, open to the entire membership, was instituted in the same year, and in later decades it became a pulpit for activist members, who suggested new directions for the ACLU, including abortion rights, death penalty, and rights of the poor.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} David C. Large wrote that, {{like any}} public pronouncements, these <b>bylaws</b> {{did not tell}} the full story about HIAG's real goals. By investigating how these statutes were applied in practice, he was able to tease out what the organisation stood for. For example, HIAG claimed to represent the entire Waffen-SS membership, surviving and fallen, as well as their families: 500,000 in total. In reality, the organisation's rolls did not exceed 20,000. HIAG attained this number in the late 1950s, and held it until the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{responsibilities}} of Kraków's president include drafting and implementing resolutions, enacting city <b>bylaws,</b> managing the city budget, employing city administrators, and preparing against floods and natural disasters. The president fulfills his duties {{with the help}} of the City Council, city managers and city inspectors. In the 1990s, the city government was reorganised to better differentiate between its political agenda and administrative functions. As a result, the Office of Public Information was created to handle inquiries and foster communication between city departments and citizens at large.|$|E

5|$|Culverhouse's {{relationships}} with other NFL owners were occasionally, as in {{his relationship with the}} Rams, alleged to constitute conflicts of interest. His $3 million loan to help Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose with his gambling debts was one example, as it violated the NFL constitution and <b>bylaws.</b> On other occasions, he was criticized for his overly-secretive ways as NFL Finance Committee Chairman, as other league owners found it difficult to obtain information on how league finances were being spent. In particular, owners were upset about not being informed about money given to NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle in a 5-year extension of his contract. The extension was awarded to him by the Finance Committee as a reward for negotiation of the league television contract in 1982, even though Rozelle had five years remaining on his current contract.|$|E
5|$|During the University of Michigan {{basketball}} scandal the Big Ten Conference, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, and United States Department of Justice {{investigated the}} relationship between the University of Michigan, its men's basketball teams and basketball team booster Ed Martin. The program was punished for NCAA rules violations, principally involving payments booster Martin made to several players to launder money from an illegal gambling operation. It {{is one of the largest}} incidents involving payments to college athletes in American collegiate history. It was described as one of the three or four worst violations of NCAA <b>bylaws</b> in history up to that time by the NCAA infractions committee chairman and the largest athlete payment scandal ever by ESPN.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{criminal}} offense {{for a person to}} fail to identify themselves to a <b>bylaw</b> officer in lawful execution of his or her duty (Obstructing a Peace Officer, sec 129 CCC), and a person could be charged with the greater charge of Assaulting a Peace Officer if assault were to occur. As well, instances of someone obstructing a <b>bylaw</b> officer and being charged with Obstruction of a Peace Officer, as well as many cases of Assault of a Peace Officer, have been tested in the courts, as shown in Turko and Jones & Hubert. However, how far the Peace Officer status extends to <b>bylaw</b> officers in other contexts is unclear, and will likely be challenged in the future. Some municipalities now use <b>bylaw</b> officers to stop and inspect commercial vehicles and even for non-criminal enforcement of marijuana grow operations. However, although it is clear that sections on obstruction and assault (for their own protection) apply to <b>bylaw</b> officers, it is unclear to what extent other peace officer powers apply to <b>bylaw</b> officers, particularly in cases where the <b>bylaw</b> officer gives direction to party that disobeys (i.e. the <b>bylaw</b> officer attempts to pull over a vehicle which intentionally fails to stop or gives lawful instructions to someone who then disobeys that instruction). It is also unclear to what extent peace officer status applies to non-proprietary (contract) employees, such as those employed by a security company on contract to a municipality.|$|R

5|$|Also {{during his}} senior year, James was the {{centerpiece}} of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur <b>bylaws</b> by accepting a Hummer H2 from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing LeBron's future earning power as a professional athlete. This prompted {{an investigation by the}} Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the gift from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source. Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high school sports eligibility. James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season. In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.|$|E
