5|$|While further <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> the Northumbrians and Picts are recorded, {{for example}} in 697 when Beornhæth's son Berhtred was killed, the Battle of Dunnichen marks the point in which Pictish {{independence}} from Northumbria was permanently secured.|$|E

25|$|In {{my opinion}} {{the two great}} players were jealous of one another. There were times in the series when I felt {{it was not so}} much a <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> England and Australia as a <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> Bradman and Hammond.|$|R

5|$|After {{the first}} two {{large-scale}} <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> the Spanish and Pipil armies resulted in decisive victories for the European invaders, the natives preferred to flee their settlements at their approach rather than face the conquistadors on an open battlefield. A common tactic of the natives was to concentrate themselves in strongly-defended mountaintop fortresses.|$|E
5|$|López I {{fortified}} Humaitá {{in the era}} of {{the wooden}} paddle-steamer warship. Gloire, the first ironclad warship was not launched until 1859 and that was in France, intended for a blue-water navy; and no <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> European ironclads had actually happened.|$|E
5|$|Periodically, Dungeons & Dragons has {{returned}} to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as Battlesystem (1985 & 1989) and a new edition of Chainmail (2001) provided rule systems to handle <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> armies by using miniatures.|$|E

A [...] "larger than life" [...] <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> Thor and the Serpent was depicted in Thor #379 - 380 (May - June 1987), with writer-artist Walter Simonson using a splash page {{to depict the}} creature's size, and then full pages to demonstrate the <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> the pair.|$|R

5|$|A {{year after}} González Dávila's {{discovery}} of the Gulf of Fonesca, various Spanish expeditions set out to conquer the territory of Honduras. These expeditions were launched southwards from Mexico and Guatemala, and northwards from Panama and Nicaragua; their rival captains clashed in Honduras, resulting in attempts at conquest of the natives being punctuated by <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> competing Spanish forces, and infighting within individual Spanish groups. The various Spanish groups also fielded indigenous auxiliaries to support their efforts.|$|E
5|$|Adventure mode is a turn-based, {{open-ended}} roguelike {{where the}} player starts off as an adventurer. In Legends mode, players can view maps, histories of each civilization and any figure {{who has lived}} or died in the generated world. Any noticeable achievement made by the player {{in any of the}} two game modes is recorded in the Legends. A testing arena is present, where players can simulate <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> selected units in various conditions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that the {{landings}} on Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo were taking place, Allied troops were also landing on nearby Guadalcanal, with the objective of capturing an airfield under construction by Japanese forces. In contrast to the intense fighting on Tulagi and Gavutu, the landings on Guadalcanal were essentially unopposed. The landings on both Tulagi and Guadalcanal initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign and a series of combined-arms <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> Allied and Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands area.|$|E

5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), {{the fighting}} dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path to remain on a line between the rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E
5|$|It {{was then}} {{believed}} that a Saxon town known as Alvertune developed. In Pierre de Langtoft's history of King Alfred he writes that in 865 it {{was the site of}} a number of <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> King Elfrid and his brother Alfred and five Danish kings and a similar number of earls. Later, in the 10th century, Danes settled at Romanby and Brompton. A fine example of English stonecarving from the period, the Brompton Hogbacks, can be found in Brompton Parish Church.|$|E
5|$|The Brown Dog {{affair was}} a {{political}} controversy about vivisection that raged in England from 1903 until 1910. It involved the infiltration by Swedish feminists of University of London medical lectures, pitched <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> medical students and the police, police protection for the statue of a dog, a libel trial at the Royal Courts of Justice, {{and the establishment of}} a Royal Commission to investigate the use of animals in experiments. The affair became a cause célèbre that divided the country.|$|E

5|$|This motion {{camouflage}} {{strategy was}} discovered and modelled as algorithms in 1995 by M. V. Srinivasan and M. Davey {{while they were}} studying mating behaviour in hoverflies. The male hoverfly appeared to be using the tracking technique to approach prospective mates. Motion camouflage has been observed in high-speed territorial <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> dragonflies, where males of the Australian emperor dragonfly, Hemianax papuensis were seen to choose their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals in 6 of 15 encounters. They made use of both real-point and infinity-point strategies.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 15th century England was {{increasingly}} divided between the rival royal factions of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists. Castles such as Windsor did not play a decisive role during the resulting Wars of the Roses (1455–85), which were fought primarily in the form of pitched <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> the rival factions. Henry VI, born at Windsor Castle and known as Henry of Windsor, became king at the young age of nine months. His long period of minority, coupled with the increasing tensions between Henry's Lancastrian supporters and the Yorkists, distracted attention from Windsor. The Garter Feasts and other ceremonial activities at the castle became more infrequent and less well attended.|$|E
5|$|Doro {{started her}} career in garage bands in native Düsseldorf {{underground}} scene and achieved media visibility and some commercial success with Warlock in the 1980s. Warlock were starting to have {{an opening in the}} US market, when they went through many line-up changes and Pesch was left the only original member of the band. She started a solo career under the name Doro, in order to avoid legal <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> her record label PolyGram and her former manager. She released two albums in the US with producers Joey Balin and Gene Simmons, but they were not the breakthrough that she hoped.|$|E

5|$|Following the Roman Empire's {{invasion}} of southern Britain, the mining of lead and {{silver in the}} Mendip Hills provided a basis for local industry and commerce. Bath became {{the site of a}} major Roman fort and city, the remains of which can still be seen. During the Early Medieval period Somerset was the scene of <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> the Anglo-Saxons and first the Britons and later the Danes. In this period it was ruled first by various kings of Wessex, and later by kings of England. Following the defeat of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy by the Normans in 1066, castles were built in Somerset.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, {{there were}} roughly 4,000 Muslim and 100 Christian tax payers, {{implying}} {{a population of}} about 15,000 or 16,000—making it larger than Jerusalem at the time. The total number of Christian families was 57. Before the outbreak of World War I, the population of Gaza had reached 42,000; however, the fierce <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> Allied Forces and the Ottomans and their German allies in 1917 in Gaza resulted in a massive population decrease. The following census, which was conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities shows a sharp decrease in population which stood at 17,480 residents, consisting of 16,722 Muslims, 54 Jews and 701 Christians.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} several months, the Japanese {{established}} a naval refueling, communications, and seaplane reconnaissance base on Tulagi and the nearby islets of Gavutu and Tanambogo, and in July 1942 began to build a large airfield on nearby Guadalcanal. The Japanese activities on Tulagi and Guadalcanal were observed by Allied reconnaissance aircraft, {{as well as by}} Australian coastwatcher personnel stationed in the area. Because these activities threatened the Allied supply and communication lines in the South Pacific, Allied forces counter-attacked with landings of their own on Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 7 August 1942, initiating the critical Guadalcanal campaign and a series of combined arms <b>battles</b> <b>between</b> Allied and Japanese forces that, along with the New Guinea campaign, decided {{the course of the war}} in the South Pacific.|$|E
