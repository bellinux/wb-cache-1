25|$|Its {{existence}} (and {{that of the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>quark)</b> was postulated in 1973 by Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa {{to explain}} the observed CP violations in kaon decay, and was discovered in 1995 by the CDF and DØ experiments at Fermilab.

It was {{discovered}} by the E288 collaboration, headed by Leon Lederman, at Fermilab in 1977, {{and was the first}} particle containing a <b>bottom</b> <b>quark</b> to be discovered because it is the lightest that can be produced without additional massive particles.

25|$|For {{two generations}} of quarks, there are no CP violating phases, {{as shown by the}} {{counting}} of the previous section. Since CP violations were seen in neutral kaon decays already in 1964, the emergence of the Standard Model soon after was a clear signal of the existence of a third generation of quarks, as pointed out in 1973 by Kobayashi and Maskawa. The discovery of the <b>bottom</b> <b>quark</b> at Fermilab (by Leon Lederman's group) in 1976 therefore immediately started off the search for the missing third-generation quark, the top quark.|$|E
500|$|In 1977, the <b>bottom</b> <b>quark</b> was {{observed}} {{by a team}} at Fermilab led by Leon Lederman. This was a strong indicator of the top quark's existence: without the top quark, the <b>bottom</b> <b>quark</b> would have been without a partner. However, {{it was not until}} 1995 that the top quark was finally observed, also by the CDF and DØ teams at Fermilab. It had a mass much larger than had been previously expected, [...] almost as large as that of a gold atom.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} rate of <b>bottom</b> <b>quarks</b> at hadron colliders exceeds {{the expectations of}} next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics. An additional contribution from pair-production of light gluinos, of mass 12 to 16 GeV, with two-body decays into <b>bottom</b> <b>quarks</b> and light <b>bottom</b> squarks, yields a differential cross section for <b>bottom</b> <b>quarks</b> in better agreement with data. The masses of the gluino and bottom squark are restricted further by the ratio of like-sign to opposite-sign leptons at hadron colliders.

2500|$|A {{distinctly}} different {{process is the}} production of single top quarks via weak interaction. This can happen in several ways (called channels): either an intermediate W-boson decays into a top and antibottom quark ("s-channel") or a <b>bottom</b> <b>quark</b> (probably created in a pair through the decay of a gluon) transforms to a top quark by exchanging a W-boson with an up or down quark ("t-channel"). A single top quark can also be produced in association with a W boson, requiring an initial state <b>bottom</b> <b>quark</b> ("tW-channel"). The first evidence for these processes was published by the DØ collaboration in December 2006, ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 3, 2008, the {{discovery}} of a new particle, the bottom Omega baryon (...) was announced at the DØ experiment of Fermilab.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that dark-matter annihilation to <b>bottom</b> <b>quarks</b> provides a good fit to the galactic-center gamma-ray excess identified in the Fermi-LAT data. In the favored dark matter mass range m∼ 30 - 40 GeV, achieving the best-fit annihilation rate σ v ∼ 5 × 10 ^- 26 cm^ 3 s^- 1 with perturbative couplings requires a sub-TeV mediator particle that interacts with both dark matter and <b>bottom</b> <b>quarks.</b> In this paper, we consider the minimal viable scenarios in which a Standard Model singlet mediates s-channel interactions only between dark matter and <b>bottom</b> <b>quarks,</b> focusing on axial-vector, vector, and pseudoscalar couplings. Using simulations that include on-shell mediator production, we show that existing sbottom searches currently offer the strongest sensitivity over a large region of the favored parameter space explaining the gamma-ray excess, particularly for axial-vector interactions. The 13 TeV LHC {{will be even more}} sensitive; however, it may not be sufficient to fully cover the favored parameter space, and the pseudoscalar scenario will remain unconstrained by these searches. We also find that direct-detection constraints, induced through loops of <b>bottom</b> <b>quarks,</b> complement collider bounds to disfavor the vector-current interaction when the mediator is heavier than twice the dark matter mass. We also present some simple models that generate pseudoscalar-mediated annihilation predominantly to <b>bottom</b> <b>quarks.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, references added, typos corrected, conclusions unchange...|$|R
40|$|Higgs-boson {{production}} {{in association with}} <b>bottom</b> <b>quarks,</b> ppbar/pp -> b bbar H + X, {{is one of the}} most important discovery channels for supersymmetric Higgs particles at the Tevatron and the LHC. We have calculated the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the parton processes qqbar,gg -> bbbar H and present results for total cross sections and for distributions in the transverse momenta of the <b>bottom</b> <b>quarks.</b> The QCD corrections reduce the renormalization and factorization scale dependence and thus stabilize the theoretical predictions, especially when the Higgs boson is produced in association with high-pT <b>bottom</b> <b>quarks.</b> The next-to-leading order predictions for the total cross section are in reasonable numerical agreement with calculations based on bottom-quark fusion bbbar ->H.

2500|$|Since {{different}} {{standard model}} fermions are grouped together in larger representations, GUTs specifically predict relations among the fermion masses, such as between the electron and the down quark, the muon {{and the strange}} quark, and the tau lepton and the <b>bottom</b> <b>quark</b> for [...] and [...] Some of these mass relations hold approximately, but most don't (see Georgi-Jarlskog mass relation).|$|E
2500|$|The squarks are the scalar superpartners of the quarks {{and there}} is one version for each Standard Model quark. Due to phenomenological {{constraints}} from flavor changing neutral currents, typically the lighter two generations of squarks have to be nearly the same in mass and therefore are not given distinct names. [...] The superpartners of the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>quark</b> can be split from the lighter squarks and are called stop and sbottom.|$|E
2500|$|Because mesons are {{composed}} of quarks, they participate in both the weak and strong interactions. Mesons with net electric charge also participate in the electromagnetic interaction. Mesons are classified according to their quark content, total angular momentum, parity and various other properties, such as C-parity and G-parity. Although no meson is stable, those of lower mass are nonetheless more stable than the more massive, and hence are easier to observe and study in particle accelerators or in cosmic ray experiments. Mesons are also typically less massive than baryons, meaning {{that they are more}} easily produced in experiments, and thus exhibit certain higher energy phenomena more readily than do baryons. For example, the charm quark was first seen in the J/Psi meson (...) in 1974, and the <b>bottom</b> <b>quark</b> in the upsilon meson (...) in 1977.|$|E
50|$|Strange quarks also bind {{with the}} heavier charm and <b>bottom</b> <b>quarks</b> which {{also like to}} bind with each other.

2500|$|The {{top quark}} interacts {{primarily}} by the strong interaction, but can only decay through the weak force.

[...] The Standard Model predicts its mean lifetime to be roughly [...] This is about a twentieth of the timescale for strong interactions, and therefore it does not form hadrons, giving physicists {{a unique opportunity to}} study a [...] "bare" [...] quark (all other quarks hadronize, meaning that they combine with other quarks to form hadrons, and can only be observed as such). Because it is so massive, the properties of the top quark allow predictions to be made of the mass of the Higgs boson under certain extensions of the Standard Model (see Mass and coupling to the Higgs boson below). As such, it is extensively studied as a means to discriminate between competing theories.|$|E
2500|$|The Inner Detector {{begins a}} few {{centimetres}} from the proton beam axis, extends to a radius of 1.2metres, and is 6.2 metres in length along the beam pipe.

[...] The starting points of the tracks yield useful information for identifying particles; for example, if a group of tracks seem to originate from a point other than the original proton–proton collision, this may be a sign that the particles came from the decay of a hadron with a <b>bottom</b> <b>quark</b> (see b-tagging).
