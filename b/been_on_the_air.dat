25|$|News Corporation, {{through its}} Fox Television Stations subsidiary, agreed to {{purchase}} Chris-Craft Industries and its stations, including KMSP-TV, for $5.35 billion in August 2000 (this brought KMSP, along with San Antonio's KMOL-TV and Salt Lake City's KTVX, back under common ownership with 20th Century Fox); the deal followed {{a bidding war}} with Viacom. The sale was completed on July 31, 2001. While Fox pledged to retain the Chris-Craft stations' UPN affiliations through at least the 2000â€“01 season, and Chris-Craft agreed to an 18-month renewal for its UPN affiliates in January 2001, an affiliation swap was expected once KMSP's affiliation agreement with UPN ran out in 2002, given Fox's presumed preference to have its programming on a station that it already owned. Additionally, KMSP's signal was much stronger than that of WFTC, it was a VHF station that had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> much longer than UHF outlet WFTC. Most importantly, Fox had been aggressively expanding local news programming on its stations, and KMSP had an established news department whereas WFTC's news department did not begin operations until April 2001. The move was made easier when, in July 2001, Fox agreed to trade KTVX and KMOL (now WOAI-TV) to Clear Channel Communications in exchange for WFTC, a transaction completed that October.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, Sesame Street had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> for over 20 years and was, as author Michael Davis put it, [...] "the undisputed heavyweight {{champion}} of preschool television". [...] The show's dominance {{began to be}} challenged throughout the decade by other television shows for preschoolers such as Barney & Friends, by {{the growth of the}} children's home video industry, and by the increase of thirty-minute children's shows on cable. [...] Sesame Street's ratings declined, so the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), the organization responsible for putting the show on the air, responded by researching the reasons for their lower ratings.|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street {{was praised}} from {{its debut in}} 1969. Newsday {{reported}} that several newspapers and magazines had written [...] "glowing" [...] reports about CTW and co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney. Although the series had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> {{for less than a}} year, Time Magazine featured Big Bird, who had received more fan mail than any of the show's human hosts, on its cover and declared, [...] "...It is not only the best children's show in TV history, {{it is one of the}} best parents' shows as well". [...] The press overwhelmingly praised the new show; several popular magazines and niche magazines lauded it. [...] A 2010 survey found that most parents supported their children's viewing of Sesame Street and other PBS educational shows, and many educators used them as aides in the classroom.|$|E

Despite being well known for his role on the British improve show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Stiles still {{had to go through}} the {{audition}} process along with everybody else. He said, [...] "I don't even think Drew was really even aware of Whose Line at that time because it hadn't <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> (in the U.S.) that many years. I think it was only on Comedy Central at that time." [...] Stiles admitted that he liked to have fun with his character and not psychoanalyze him. Following his appearance in The Beverly Hillbillies, Diedrich Bader realised he needed a regular income and decided to return to television. He tested out for The Drew Carey Show, but did not initially want to be cast in it. He told Kevin Smith that he wanted to drive up his price for the pilot of Partners. Bader lost out on {{the role of}} Bob to Jon Cryer and then learned The Drew Carey Show wanted to hire him to play Oswald Lee Harvey.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Dan Povenmire, while Peter Shin contributed as supervising director. Various scenes in [...] "PTV" [...] were {{taken out of the}} episode due to Fox's international censors. As the writers worked on the episode the producers ended up, as the Chicago Tribune describes it, [...] "horse trading" [...] with Fox, removing a body-part reference in exchange for a dirty word. While the writing staff of the show was disappointed with the number of scenes that were removed from the episode, they were happy with the final result. The opening sequence, of which Family Guys creator Seth MacFarlane was particularly proud, was added into the episode after the producers discovered the episode ran three minutes short. The episode contained a montage which showcased the most bawdy moments of the previous seasons; Povenmire recalled the sequence; about it he stated that [...] "I just found those off the DVD and digitized them and edited them in. Basically because I didn't want to draw all those things! I found the most disgusting images from the first three seasons. And we actually got network notes on two of them saying, 'You're gonna have to cut that!' And I went, 'This has <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air!</b> And I'm only showing 8 frames of it!' And it turns out we cut them now when they're on the air. So apropos for the FCC episode." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" [...] {{was written}} by David S. Cohen and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. The episode was conceived as a commentary on {{what it was like}} to work on a television show that had long <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> but was considered to be nearing its end. This was intended to show that The Simpsons could still be good after eight seasons, even though it no longer had the [...] "shock value" [...] it did in the early years. Before production of season eight began, several executives at Fox suggested the staff add a new character to the show, who would live with the Simpsons on a permanent basis, in a bid to freshen up the series. The writers found the suggestion, usually considered a sign of desperation to boost a flagging series, amusing, therefore much of the episode revolves around this trope. Parallel to the episode's main plot, where Poochie is introduced on The Itchy & Scratchy Show to boost its ratings, the writers inserted the one-time character Roy, a college-aged man who is shown to be living with the Simpsons, with no explanation as to his character or presence, as a reference to the executives' proposal. Roy was originally conceived for the [...] "Time and Punishment" [...] segment of the season six episode [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", living with the Simpsons in one of the alternate realities, as a second, teenage son in the family.|$|E

500|$|Vince Gilligan, {{who wrote}} the episode, was {{inspired}} by Cops, which he describes as a [...] "great slice of Americana." [...] Gilligan first pitched the idea to the X-Files writing staff and to series creator Chris Carter during the show's fourth season. Carter was concerned that the concept was too [...] "goofy". Fellow writer and producer Frank Spotnitz concurred; however, he was more uncomfortable with Gilligan's idea of using videotape instead of film to shoot the episode. The show's production crew liked to use film to create [...] "effective scares", and Spotnitz worried that shooting exclusively on videotape would be too challenging as the series {{would be unable to}} cut and edit the final product. However, during the show's seventh season, Carter relented. Many critics and fans believed, erroneously, that the seventh season of The X-Files would be the show's last. Similarly, Carter felt that the show had nearly run its course. Seeing the potential in Gilligan's idea, he decided to green-light the episode. Gilligan noted that [...] "the longer we've <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> the more chances we've taken. We try to keep the show fresh... I think [...] appreciates that". [...] "X-Cops" [...] was not Gilligan's first attempt at writing a cross-over. Almost three years before, he had been working on a script that would involve a story being presented by Robert Stack of Unsolved Mysteries, with unknown actors playing Mulder and Scully. This script was later aborted, and re-written as the fifth season episode [...] "Bad Blood".|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Boortz {{enrolled}} in then-unaccredited John Marshall Law School (Atlanta) going to class {{in his spare}} time, while {{he and his wife}} Donna worked full-time loading mail trucks. Boortz credits his wife with providing [...] "the money to keep me in law school". After graduating from law school in 1977, Boortz practiced law in a solo law firm from 1977 through 1993. During that period, he divided his time between his law practice and work in radio. One of Boortz's clients was boxer Evander Holyfield. Holyfield later sued Boortz and other members of his management team {{in the aftermath of a}} failed Subaru dealership investment. Boortz told Atlanta Magazine [...] "It had nothing to do with representing him as a boxer. It was settled and disappeared." [...] Some time later, in a heated on-air exchange between Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell and Boortz, Campbell remarked on the Holyfield relationship: Campbell (sarcastically): By the way, Neal, Evander Holyfield sends his regards ... We talked a little about how good he's doing now and the fact he's getting ready to open up his 57,000 square-foot, $20 million home. How he's fighting for $35 million a fight. I was sorta thinking about when you were representing him. He was living in an apartment over on Lenox Road. He was fighting for about $20,000 a fight. It's sort of interesting how your great legal skills have transferred into financial well-being for Evander .... Boortz responded by calling mayor Campbell an [...] "unethical son of a bitch". Boortz later remarked [...] "It's the only time I've ever <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> that I lost control." [...] In 1993, Boortz closed his law practice and devoted his full-time to his radio career.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" [...] mainly {{deals with}} themes {{commonly}} known as [...] "jumping the shark," [...] instances that usually occur when a failing show adds a new character or twist to boost ratings. Before production of season eight began, Fox executives suggested the staff to add a new character to the show, who would live with the Simpsons on a permanent basis. The staff, amused with the idea, decided to write this episode as a commentary on {{what it was like}} to work on a television show that had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> for several years. Parallel to Poochie being introduced on Itchy & Scratchy, they inserted the one-time character Roy, with no explanation as to who he was, or why he was there, as a reference to the executive's proposal. Usually, this is a technique used in shows that involves children who have grown up. This was the case in [...] "Oliver" [...] in The Brady Bunch or [...] "Luke" [...] on Growing Pains. The episode was intended to be a commentary on {{what it was like to}} work on a television show that had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> for a long time but was nearing its end. It was intended to show that The Simpsons could still be good after eight seasons, even though it no longer had the [...] "shock value" [...] it did in the early years.

2500|$|Although Dinah's Place {{featured}} famous guest stars, Shore often grilled lesser-known lifestyle {{experts on}} nutrition, exercise, or homemaking. Despite {{being one of}} the more popular programs in NBC's morning lineup, this show left the air in 1974 after NBC sent a telegram to Dinah congratulating her on her Emmy winâ€”at the same time informing her the show was being cancelled, because it broke up a [...] "game show programming block". Thus ended the network's 35-year association with Shore. She returned that fall with Dinah!, a syndicated 90-minute daily talk show (also seen in a 60-minute version on some stations) that put the focus on top guest stars and entertainment. This show was seen as competition for Mike Douglas and Merv Griffin, whose shows had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> for 10 years when Dinah! debuted. Frequent guests included entertainment figures (Lucille Ball, Bob Hope, and James Stewart), as well as regular contributors including lifestyle guru Dr. Wayne Dyer.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1980s and 1990s, popular {{cultural}} forms, especially television programs, {{began to}} reference Domingo, {{often as a}} prototypical opera singer {{or as part of}} the influential Three Tenors. In 1987 Sesame Street, a U.S. children's television show that has <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> since 1969, introduced a puppet character named after Domingo. In the series, Placido Flamingo was a pink singing bird who appeared regularly on [...] "Live from the Nest" [...] (a play on [...] "Live from the Met") telecasts from the Nestropolitan Opera. In the 1989 special [...] "Sesame Street... 20 Years & Still Counting", Domingo appeared with his namesake puppet, singing [...] "Look through the Window" [...] together. The show never revived the character after the puppeteer, Richard Hunt, who provided the voice for Placido Flamingo, died in early 1992. Similarly, in the 2009 Australian-Canadian cartoon comedy Pearlie, the father of a family of opera singing fleas is named Placido. Although not opera related, one of the Three Emperors (a take-off on the Three Tenors) in the original Japanese version of the anime series, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (2008-2011), is also named after the singer.|$|E
