60|$|You {{may well}} {{believe that the}} people came in crowds, for nearly every one wished to be king or queen, as the case might be. This music had a very {{singular}} effect upon {{most of those who}} did not succeed in singing it. They nearly all went crazy. The first few notes were easy, and they were so beautiful, that it was enough to make any one crazy to think that they could not sing the rest of it,--not to mention missing the crown. The Prime Minister had, on this account, a great asylum built, to which the disappointed candidates were immediately conveyed, and the house was very soon filled. Indeed, it was often necessary to build extensions to the main building, and it was not long before this was the largest edifice in the country. It is true, that although every one failed to sing the music, they did not all go crazy; but they were taken to the asylum the same as the rest, and if they were not crazy when they got there, they soon became so, and thus it amounted to pretty much the same thing in the end. Well, the judges sat in their chairs until they died at a good old age, and they were succeeded by others just as learned. Latterly there were not so many applications as there used to be, but still, every few days, some one went out to the asylum. Years passed, and the offices of the judges became sinecures; but they had to sit there all the same, just as if they expected to be busy; and they might have been seen, whenever anybody chose to step in during the day, sitting there with their chins on their <b>breasts,</b> <b>fast</b> asleep. The Prime Minister, and after him his son, ruled the country very well, and people began to feel as if they didn't care if they never had a king or a queen to govern them. As a rule, they all felt very comfortable without anything of the kind.|$|R

30|$|Both {{detection}} and localisation performance decreased with increased <b>breast</b> density at <b>fast</b> presentations. These results {{are related to}} {{what we know about}} clutter in natural scenes and visual search in free-viewing: increasing clutter or set size decreases performance (Adamo, Cain, & Mitroff, 2015; Asher, Tolhurst, Troscianko, & Gilchrist, 2013; Rosenholtz, Li, Mansfield, & Jin, 2005; Rosenholtz, Li, & Nakano, 2007; Whitney & Levi, 2011; Wolfe, 1994). Fibroglandular tissue, which increases density on a mammogram, appears more radio-opaque than fat and may increase crowding and/or masking effects reducing performance in the denser mammograms. In the medical perception literature, {{there have been a number}} of studies that have investigated factors such as lesion subtlety, which may be dependent on the surrounding anatomical structures (e.g. Krupinski, 2005).

CASE REPORT: A 58 -year-old black female patient was referred to the Mastology unit of the Department of Gynecology, Federal University of São Paulo / Escola Paulista de Medicina, in February 1990, presenting an ulcerated tumor in the right <b>breast</b> with <b>fast</b> growth over the preceding six months. She was a virgin, with meno-pause {{at the age of}} 45 years and had not undergone hormone replacement treatment. The physical examination showed, in her right breast, an ulcerated tumor of 20 x 30 cm which was not adher-ent to the muscle level, multilobular and with fibroelastic consistency. The axillary lymph nodes were not palpable. The left breast showed a 2 x 3 cm painless, movable nodule, with well-defined edges, and fibroelastic consistency. We performed left-breast mammography, which showed several nodules with well-defined edges, the largest being 2 x 3 cm and exhibiting rough calcification and grouped microcalcifications within it. The patient underwent a frozen biopsy that showed a malignant variant of the phyllodes tumor in the right breast and fibroadenoma in the left one. After that, we performed a total mastectomy in the right breast and an excision biopsy in the left one. Paraffin study confirmed the frozen biopsy result from the right breast, yet we observed that in the interior of the fibroadenoma that was removed on the left, there was a focal area of invasive lobular carcinoma measuring 0. 4 cm.

40|$|Resistance to {{antiestrogen}} therapy {{remains a}} significant problem in breast cancer. Low expression of inhibitor of growth 4 (ING 4) in primary tumors has been correlated with increased rates of recurrence in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer patients, suggesting a role for ING 4 in ER signaling. This study provides evidence that ING 4 inhibits ER activity. ING 4 overexpression increased the sensitivity of T 47 D and MCF 7 ER+ breast cancer cells to hormone deprivation. ING 4 attenuated maximal estrogen-dependent cell growth without affecting the dose-response of estrogen. These results indicated that ING 4 functions as a noncompetitive inhibitor of estrogen signaling and may inhibit estrogen-independent ER activity. Supportive of this, treatment with fulvestrant but not tamoxifen rendered T 47 D cells sensitive to hormone deprivation as did ING 4 overexpression.

40|$|Introduction: Ambulatory {{treatment}} {{of breast cancer}} is limited by vomiting and post-operative pain, and general anesthesia is implicated in these effects. Dexmedetomidine supplies analgesia and sedation without respiratory depression when it is administered intravenously. We demonstrate the usefulness of Dexmedetomidine as a general endovenous anesthesia. Methods: Female patients were included with ages ranging between 42 and 83 years old and with a breast cancer diagnosis. They were scheduled for radical surgery between May 2009 and April 2011. Dexmedetomidine plus Propofol and Fentanyl were administered. Intra-operative monitoring included electrocardiography, arterial blood gas analysis, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and arterial oxygen saturation. We registered surgery and sedation according to the bispectral index and Ramsay scales. Results: The patients were maintained with 95 % oxygen saturation and breathed spontaneously during the entire procedure with supplementary oxygen. Their blood pressure remained constant; heart rate showed only a mild reduction, bispectral index was maintained at 50, and the Ramsey scale-at IV. The infusion was discontinued without the patients experiencing dizziness or vomiting; the patients had an easy response-to-voice awakening and remained in the recovery room for at least 2 h. They were physiologically stable, and were left with additional supplementary oxygen. There was no pain or agitation observed during the recovery period and no narcotic was administered.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{possible}} relationships {{of breast cancer}} risk to prediagnostic plasma levels of insulin; insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I); and IGF-binding proteins - 1, - 2, and - 3. Methods: Within two prospective cohorts in Umea and Malmo we measured plasma concentrations of insulin, IGF-I, and IGFBPs {{for a total of}} 513 incident breast cancer cases and 987 matched controls. Results: Globally, risk was unassociated with levels of IGF-I, IGFBP- 3, or IGF-I adjusted for IGFBP- 3. When breaking down the analysis by subgroups of age at blood donation, an increase in risk was observed for increasing levels of IGF-I in women aged 55 or older, in the Umea cohort only (odds ratios of 1. 00, 1. 73, 1. 76, 1. 90; p(trend) = 0. 05). This effect weakened, however, when the analysis was restricted to subjects who did not use exogenous hormones for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Levels of IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 were not related to risk in younger women, recruited before age 50, contrary to observations from previous studies. In a subcohort where blood samples had been collected after at least four hours of <b>fasting,</b> <b>breast</b> cancer risk showed no clear associations with levels of insulin, IGFBP- 1, or IGFBP- 2. Conclusions: Our results do not confirm earlier findings of an association of plasma IGF-I levels with breast cancer risk especially in young women, but suggest a possible association with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, possibly among ERT/HRT users only. Our results do not support the hypothesis that elevated plasma insulin levels, and reduced levels of IGFBP- 1 and IGFBP- 2, are associated with increased breast cancer risk...|$|R
40|$|Background Recurrence {{of breast}} cancer to latissimus dorsi (LD) flap donor site is a very rare condition, and as a result, few data are {{currently}} available on its possible causes. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the role of LD flap transfer in lymphangiogenesis and connection to the preexisting lymphatic network after mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection and the lymphatic drainage involvement in local relapse to flap donor site. Methods Lymphoscintigraphy was performed on subgroup of ten patients who had previously undergone modified radical mastectomy, axillary lymph node dissection, and pedicled LD flap reconstruction. Lymphatic drainage was imaged by static gamma camera acquisitions after two intradermal injections of 37 MBq 99 mTc-Nanocoll® on residual breast skin and LD skin paddle, respectively. Results In eight cases (80 %), the residual <b>breast</b> skin showed <b>fast</b> lymphatic drainage directed only toward the ipsilateral axilla, while in two cases (20 %), it was also seen to the internal mammary nodes. LD skin paddle showed slower drainage in all cases but 1, where no visible drainage was observed within 2 h after injection. Conclusions Although a small case series is the study limitation, our findings suggested that the LD flap harvest can promote a preferential route of lymphatic drainage in the axillary region and could be involved in a metastatic spread to the dorsum because of the new tissue plane opening. The direct communication created between recipient and donor sites could have lead to cell cancer transfer to the donor site either by lymphatic or a contiguity pathway.

After thawing, the following parameters were evaluated: moisture content, drip loss (syneresis), water activity (aw), and shear force. Samples were also histologically evaluated by light microscopy. The results indicated that, despite being submitted to fast freezing, thawing affected (p < 0. 05) most of the physicochemical and structural properties of the meat, except for aw. Thawing in cold water (packed in low-density polyethylene bags and placed in cold water at approximately 10 °C for 2 hours and 15 minutes) presented the best results due to lesser damage to the cell structure, as shown by the lower drip loss, higher moisture content, and greater tenderness of the samples compared to those thawed using the other methods. Histological examination showed that muscle fiber structural features and organization were maintained. Thawing at low temperatures seems to cause less damage to the meat structure and allows maintaining of its properties.

Physical examination was carried out on all the students. Information on the students was also obtained from the parents. Blood samples were taken by using the finger pricking technique. Body mass index (BMI) was used as a measure of physical growth. The students were mainly from urban areas (82. 9 %). The mean age was 9. 71 years and a higher proportion was females (51 %). Malays constituted 83. 6 %, Indians 11. 6 % and Chinese 4. 2 % of the study population. The mean weight and height were 32. 30 kg and 135. 18 cm respectively.

40|$|Involucrin (hINV) is an {{important}} structural component of the keratinocyte confined envelope that is expressed early in the keratinocyte differentiation process and {{is thought to be}} a component of the initial envelope scaffolding. We have previously shown that cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage of cornified envelopes isolated from cultured foreskin keratinocytes releases several discrete involucrin-immunoreactive peptides. In this study, we compare the pattern of release of immunoreactive hINV fragments from envelopes prepared from human breast skin and foreskin, and from spontaneous and induced envelopes prepared from cultured keratinocytes. We also identify one of the released products. Envelopes prepared from human breast skin or foreskin, or spontaneous or induced envelopes prepared from cultured cells differ significantly in structure. The envelopes isolated from epidermis appear to be structurally complete, whereas spontaneous envelopes appear less complete and the induced envelopes appear to be the least complete. In spite of these structural differences, CNBr cleavage releases an identical quartet of hINV-immunoreactive peptides migrating between 68 and 81 kDa from each preparation. Immunoblots indicate that the quantity of hINV-immunoreactive material released per μg of envelope protein is as follows: induced> spontaneous> foreskin> <b>breast</b> skin. The <b>fastest</b> migrating peptide (68 kDa) comigrates with a peptide that is released after CNBr cleavage of bacterially produced recombinant hINV. Amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of this peptide from recombinant hINV and from the cornified envelopes yields the sequence G-Q-L-K-H-L-E-Q-Q-E-G-Q-P-K-H. These results suggest that this fragment is the 275 -amino acid segment of hINV beginning at G 311 and extending to K 585 and that this peptide is not crosslinked to another protein. These results indicate that a population of the enveloped-associated hINV present in cultured and in vivo keratinocytes is crosslinked in the amino-terminal half. It is possible that this species represents an early intermediate in the involucrin crosslinking process...|$|R

A total of 1584 sexed one day old chicks (792 males and 792 females) were housed in 48 pens, 33 birds per pen. The experimental design was a completely randomized factorial 2 x 6 (six genotypes and two sexes) design, with four replicates each. Diets were based on corn and soybean meal (no animal protein) provided in a feeding program in four phases: pre-starter (1 to 21 days), starter (22 to 42 days), growth (43 to 77 days) and finisher (78 to 91 days). Feed intake, feed conversion and livability were measured at 21, 42, 77 and 91 days of age. There was no genotype x sex interaction. The effect of sex was observed in all ages regarding weight gain, feed conversion (except at 21 days) and yields. For all these characteristics, males performed better than females, except in breast yield, which was higher in females. For the livability and feed conversion at 21 days no effect of sex was found. The effect of genotype was observed only in carcass and <b>breast</b> yields. The <b>fast</b> (GEN 1) and intermediate (GEN 2, GEN 5 and GEN 6) growing genotypes showed higher weight gain than the slow growing genotypes (GEN 4 and GEN 3).

40|$|Background: This study {{focussed}} on evaluating fast 3 D near-infrared breast imaging {{using the}} optical contrast agent indocyanine green (ICG) as a non-invasive technique for functional tissue examination. Currently optical breast imaging {{is not able}} to differentiate between malignant and benign breast lesions merely using intrinsic tissue contrast of hemoglobin, lipids and water. The use of ICG aimed on improvement of the detection und characterization of breast masses. Methods: 30 patients with suspicious <b>breast</b> lesions underwent <b>fast</b> 2 Hz 3 D optical mammography before, during, and after administration of a 25 mg ICG bolus prior to needle biopsy (gold standard). The bolus kinetics of each volume segment of the breast was analysed using the two common perfusion parameters ‘Peak Amplitude’ (PA) and ‘Time to Peak’ (TTP). Aiming on an objective reader-independent differentiation of benign and malignant lesions a third perfusion parameter based on combination of PA and TTP was introduced: the ‘Peaktime-Amplitude’ (PTA). With help of a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis a PTA cut-off was calculated which allowed separation of both groups. Results: Functional NIR-Images basing on PA and TTP for ICG perfusion revealed higher peaks at early time points for breasts with malignant lesions. For 22 breasts (22 patients) the cut-off-based PTA analysis allowed correct detection for 12 of 14 malignant lesions (tumor size: 8 – 80 mm; sensitivity 85, 7 %). Two malignant lesions were missed (IDC, 15 mm; ILDC, 16 mm). In the benign study group only 1 fibroadenoma (10 mm) was detected falsely positive (specificity = 87, 5 %). Separate analysis of breasts with high glandular densitiy (13 breasts with BI-RADS 3 or 4) showed a decreased sensitivity (75 %) at similar specificity (83, 3 %). Statistical analysis of PTA-values for both groups yielded {{a significant difference between the}} benign and malignant group (Mann-Whitney U-test, p < 0, 05). A total of 8 patients were excluded from data analysis due to insufficient coupling of the breast to the interface, large breast size (exceeding the breast interface) or because of rare histological findings (T-cell lymphoma, melanoma metastasis). Conclusions: Early perfusion of ICG enhanced 3 D fast optical mammography presented different enhancement patterns for breasts with malignant compaired to breasts with benign lesions. A reader-independent analysis offered a high sensitivity (85, 7 %) and specificity (87, 5 %). After further investigation this technique might be applicable as an add-on tool in clinical diagnostics...|$|R
40|$|O câncer de mama é a {{neoplasia}} mais comum entre as mulheres. Existem diversos fatores que estão associados ao desenvolvimento desta neoplasia, que tem etiologia multifatorial e pode se originar de uma combinação de fatores genéticos, hormonais e ambientais. Este estudo teve como objetivo investigar a relação entre níveis séricos de adipocinas e moléculas de adesão com fatores antropométricos e bioquímicos em mulheres com e sem câncer de mama. Participaram do estudo 47 mulheres com câncer de mama e 145 sem a neoplasia. As mulheres com câncer de mama tiveram menos filhos e amamentaram por menos tempo. Encontrou-se correlação inversa para índice de massa corporal (IMC) e circunferência da cintura (CC) com HDL-colesterol em todas as participantes. Adiponectina correlacionou-se inversamente com todas as medidas antropométricas apenas nas mulheres com câncer de mama. PAI- 1 correlacionouse diretamente com CC e relação cintura-quadril nas mulheres com a neoplasia. VCAM- 1 apresentou correlação inversa com IMC e CC nas mulheres sem câncer de mama, enquanto que a glicemia de jejum teve correlação direta com estas medidas. Para cada aumento de 1 ng/ml de adiponectina, PAI- 1 e ICAM- 1 ocorre, respectivamente, aumento de 0, 8 %, 5, 2 % e 4, 3 % no risco de desenvolver câncer de mama. Assim, mulheres com câncer de mama apresentam níveis séricos elevados de adiponectina, PAI- 1, VCAM- 1 e ICAM- 1, apesar de terem médias de IMC menores. Breast {{cancer is}} the most common neoplasia among women. There are several factors that are associated with the development of this neoplasia, which has a multifactoral etiology and can arise from a combination of genetic, hormonal and environmental factors. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum levels of adipokines and adhesion molecules with anthropometric and biochemical factors in women with and without breast cancer. 47 women with breast cancer and 145 without neoplasia participated in the study. Women with breast cancer had fewer children and breastfed for less time. We found an inverse correlation for body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) with HDL cholesterol in all participants. Adiponectin was inversely correlated with all anthropometric measures only in women with breast cancer. PAI- 1 was directly correlated with WC and WHR in women with neoplasia. VCAM- 1 was inversely correlated with BMI and WC in women without <b>breast</b> cancer, while <b>fasting</b> glycemia had a direct correlation with these measures. For every 1 ng/ml increase of adiponectin, PAI- 1 and ICAM- 1 there is, respectively, an increase of 0. 8 %, 5. 2 % and 4. 3 % in risk of developing breast cancer. Therefore, women with breast cancer have high serum levels of adiponectin, PAI- 1, VCAM- 1 and ICAM- 1, despite having lower BMI mean...|$|R
