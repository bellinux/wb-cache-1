5|$|The most {{important}} oxide is TiO2, which exists in three important polymorphs; anatase, <b>brookite,</b> and rutile. All {{of these are}} white diamagnetic solids, although mineral samples can appear dark (see rutile).

5|$|Common titanium-containing {{minerals}} are anatase, <b>brookite,</b> ilmenite, perovskite, rutile, and titanite (sphene). Akaogiite is {{an extremely}} rare mineral consisting of titanium dioxide. Of these minerals, only rutile and ilmenite have economic importance, yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations. About 6.0 and 0.7 million tonnes of those minerals were mined in 2011, respectively. Significant titanium-bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western Australia, Canada, China, India, Mozambique, New Zealand, Norway, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Ukraine. About 186,000 tonnes of titanium metal sponge were produced in 2011, mostly in China (60,000 t), Japan (56,000 t), Russia (40,000 t), United States (32,000 t) and Kazakhstan (20,700 t). Total reserves of titanium are estimated to exceed 600 million tonnes.|$|E
25|$|As one example, Pauling {{considered}} the three mineral forms of titanium dioxide, {{each with a}} coordination number of 6 for the Ti4+ cations. The most stable (and most abundant) form is rutile, in which the coordination octahedra are arranged so that each one shares only two edges (and no faces) with adjoining octahedra. The other two, less stable, forms are <b>brookite</b> and anatase, in which each octahedron shares three and four edges respectively with adjoining octahedra.|$|E

50|$|Pseudobrookite {{was first}} {{described}} in 1878 for an occurrence in Uroi Hill (Arany Hill), Simeria, Hunedoara County, Romania. The name is from Greek ψευδής, for false, and <b>brookite</b> {{because of its}} misleading similar appearance to <b>brookite.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Brookite</b> is the {{orthorhombic}} {{variant of}} titanium dioxide, TiO2, which occurs in four natural polymorphic forms (minerals {{with the same}} composition but different structure). The International Mineralogical Association (IMA) recognizes these four forms; the others are akaogiite (monoclinic), anatase (tetragonal) and rutile (tetragonal). <b>Brookite</b> is rare compared to anatase and rutile and, like these forms, it exhibits photocatalytic activity. [...] <b>Brookite</b> has a larger cell volume than either anatase or rutile, with 8 TiO2 groups per unit cell, compared with 4 for anatase and 2 for rutile.

5000|$|Akaogiite is an {{exceedingly}} rare mineral, one of natural forms of titanium dioxide. It is the high-pressure polymorph of TiO2, polymorphous with anatase, <b>brookite</b> and another high-pressure phase called [...] "TiO2 II".|$|E
50|$|The <b>brookite</b> {{structure}} is built up of distorted octahedra with a titanium ion {{at the center}} and oxygen ions {{at each of the}} six vertices. Each octahedron shares three edges with adjoining octahedra, forming an orthorhombic structure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brookite</b> is an {{accessory}} mineral in alpine veins in gneiss and schist; {{it is also}} a common detrital mineral. Associated minerals include its polymorphs anatase and rutile, and also titanite, orthoclase, quartz, hematite, calcite, chlorite and muscovite.|$|E

50|$|The Magnet Cove igneous complex lies to {{the west}} of the town. The area is known for its {{abundance}} of odd minerals, including magnetite usually in the form of lodestone, as well as many other species such as rutile, anatase, <b>brookite,</b> perovskite, and some rare-earth-bearing minerals.|$|E

50|$|<b>Brookite</b> {{belongs to}} the {{orthorhombic}} dipyramidal crystal class 2/m 2/m 2/m (also designated mmm). The space group is Pcab and the unit cell parameters are a = 5.4558 Å, b = 9.1819 Å and c = 5.1429 Å. The formula is TiO2, with 8 formula units per unit cell (Z = 8).|$|E
50|$|Thermodynamically, rutile is {{the most}} stable {{polymorph}} of TiO2 at all temperatures, exhibiting lower total free energy than metastable phases of anatase or <b>brookite.</b> Consequently, {{the transformation of the}} metastable TiO2 polymorphs to rutile is irreversible. As it has the lowest molecular volume of the three main polymorphs; it is generally the primary titanium bearing phase in most high-pressure metamorphic rocks, chiefly eclogites.|$|E
50|$|Titanium {{white is}} the most popular white for artists today; it is the {{brightest}} available white pigment, and has twice the coverage of lead white. It first became commercially available in 1921. It is made out of titanium dioxide, from the minerals <b>brookite,</b> anatase, rutile, or ilmenite, currently the major source. Because of its brilliant whiteness, it is used as a colorant for most toothpaste and sunscreen.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the magnetite which forms both massive lodestone and crystals, the complex is strewn with odd and rare minerals, and is the type locality for five mineral species. Over 100 different minerals have been identified from the area.There are many titanium minerals such as rutile, anatase, <b>brookite,</b> and perovskite, {{as well as some}} vanadium mineralization. Some rare-earth-bearing minerals have also been identified.|$|E
50|$|Within the igneous environment, rutile is {{a common}} {{accessory}} mineral in plutonic igneous rocks, though it is also found occasionally in extrusive igneous rocks, particularly those that have deep mantle sources such as kimberlites and lamproites.

50|$|The crystal {{structure}} of armalcolite {{is close to}} that of distorted <b>brookite.</b> It is based on deformed octahedra, with a titanium atom {{in the center and}} six oxygen atoms at the corners. Magnesium or iron ions are located in the interstitial sites; they do not contribute significantly to the lattice framework, which is held by Ti-O bonds via the corners of the octahedra. However, these ions affect optical properties, rendering the mineral opaque in contrast to the transparent titanium dioxide TiO2.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brookite</b> is a brittle mineral, with a subconchoidal to {{irregular}} fracture and poor cleavage {{in one direction}} parallel to the c crystal axis and traces of cleavage in a direction perpendicular to both the a and the b crystal axes. Twinning is uncertain. The mineral has a Mohs hardness of 5½ to 6, between apatite and feldspar. This is the same hardness as anatase and {{a little less than}} that of rutile (6 to 6½). The specific gravity is 4.08 to 4.18, between that of anatase at 3.9 and rutile at 4.2.|$|E
50|$|Occurring {{as a minor}} {{accessory}} mineral, xenotime {{is found}} in pegmatites and other igneous rocks, as well as gneisses rich in mica and quartz. Associated minerals include biotite and other micas, chlorite group minerals, quartz, zircon, certain feldspars, analcime, anatase, <b>brookite,</b> rutile, siderite and apatite. Xenotime is also known to be diagenetic: It may form as minute grains or as extremely thin (less than 10 µ) coatings on detrital zircon grains in siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. The importance of these diagenetic xenotime deposits in the radiometric dating of sedimentary rocks is only beginning to be realised.|$|E
