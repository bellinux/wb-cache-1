5|$|Bramshill {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} most haunted houses in England. According to one UK police officer who worked at the college, 14 ghosts have purportedly been identified, {{although}} another officer at the college did not take these suggestions seriously. They include a Grey Lady (one story suggests that her husband, a religious dissenter, was beheaded in the 17th century) and a Green Man (a Cope family member who either drowned in the lake in 1806, according to the journalist P. Lal, or threw himself off a cliff near Brighton, according to the author Penny Legg). The Green Man, dressed as his name suggests, reportedly manifests near the lake, as does the ghost supposed to be that of a gardener who drowned there. The Grey Lady allegedly haunts the terrace, the library, and the chapel. Legg suggests that she has a young and <b>beautiful</b> <b>appearance,</b> with a sad, tear-stained face and golden hair, and smelling of the lilies of the valley; Lal argues that she has reddish-brown hair and wears a grey, sleeveless robe. The Grey Lady's husband has been reported to haunt the stables and the chapel drawing room. The ghost of a young child allegedly haunts the library and the Fleur de Lys room; the child has supposedly been heard crying, and attempts to hold visitors' hands. Folklore holds that the Grey Lady was the child's mother. A lady dressed in the style of Queen Anne, and a knight in armour, are reported to have been seen in the chapel drawing room. The chapel itself is purportedly frequented by the ghost of a lady in 17th-century dress, and by that of a nun. A young man dressed in 1920s tennis garb, reputed to be a Cope family member who fell from a train, has supposedly been seen in the reception area of the house. A small boy documented to haunt the terrace is said to have fallen from the roof sometime in the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|Ben Land snr., private trainer to Lord Poulett at Droxford, {{had decided}} to retire in 1870, and Chris Green was persuaded {{to take his place}} in Hampshire in September 1870 where he took charge of such horses as Benazet, Cortolvin and The Lamb. He was given the task of {{preparing}} The Lamb, a little iron grey Irish horse, for a second Grand National win and during the winter 'Lord Poulett and his party were exceedingly sanguine of success, and his Lordship caused a private circular to be distributed among his friends telling them to back The Lamb to win'. For the race itself, The Lamb, unseen in public for exactly two years, was paraded by Ben Land jun. and 'was greeted with a buzz of admiration, aroused by his <b>beautiful</b> <b>appearance</b> and condition... No horse in the world could have looked better than The Lamb did'. This testament to Green's work continued in the race as The Lamb kept ahead of the pursuing horses to finally win by a couple of lengths in 'a desperately exciting finish'.|$|E

500|$|Discussing Captain Dumitriu's suicide attempt, John Simon writes: [...] "It is {{visually}} stunning {{and emotionally}} shattering, {{but it may}} be a bit too theatrical. Still, with such writing, directing, and acting—most prominently from Kristin Scott-Thomas and Claudiu Bleonţ as the Dumitrius, but also from the rest—what is a small faux pas? This film resonates in the memory, insistently and inspiredly." [...] Simon also discusses the cinematography, arguing that Călin Ghibu's use of lighting manages to convey the [...] "almost unearthly beauty at sunset", which helps viewers understand why Scott Thompson's character uses Mount Fuji as her preferred metaphor for the place. Of this aspect, James notes: [...] "Like its heroine, the film's serene and <b>beautiful</b> <b>appearance</b> masks a powerful conscience." ...|$|E
500|$|Rita (Laura Elena Harring) is {{the mysterious}} and {{helpless}} apparent victim, a classic femme fatale with her dark, strikingly <b>beautiful</b> <b>appearance.</b> Roger Ebert {{was so impressed}} with Harring that he said of her [...] "all she has to do is stand there and she is the first good argument in 55years for a Gilda remake". She serves as the object of desire, directly oppositional to Betty's bright self-assuredness. She is also the first character with whom the audience identifies, and as viewers know her only as confused and frightened, not knowing who she is and where she is going, she represents their desire {{to make sense of the}} film through her identity. Instead of threatening, she inspires Betty to nurture, console and help her. Her amnesia makes her a blank persona, which one reviewer notes is [...] "the vacancy that comes with extraordinary beauty and the onlooker's willingness to project any combination of angelic and devilish onto her". A character analysis of Rita asserts that her actions are the most genuine of the first portion of the film, since she has no memory and nothing to use as a frame of reference for how to behave. Todd McGowan, however, author of a book on themes in Lynch's films, states that the first portion of Mulholland Drive can be construed as Rita's fantasy, until Diane Selwyn is revealed; Betty is the object that overcomes Rita's anxiety about her loss of identity. According to film historian Steven Dillon, Diane transitions a former roommate into Rita: following a tense scene where the roommate collects her remaining belongings, Rita appears in the apartment, smiling at Diane.|$|E
2500|$|In 1179, {{following}} the family's alliance with Manuel I Comnenos, Conrad led an army against Frederick Barbarossa's forces, then commanded by the imperial Chancellor, Archbishop Christian of Mainz. He defeated them at Camerino in September, taking the Chancellor hostage. (He {{had previously been}} a hostage of the Chancellor.) He left the captive in his brother Boniface's care and went to Constantinople to be rewarded by the Emperor, returning to Italy shortly after Manuel's death in 1180. Now in his mid-thirties, his personality and good looks made a striking impression at the Byzantine court: Niketas Choniates describes him as [...] "of <b>beautiful</b> <b>appearance,</b> comely in life's springtime, exceptional and peerless in manly courage and intelligence, and in the flower of his body's strength".|$|E

2500|$|Another {{explanation}} may {{be sought}} in respective ideals of ugliness — most [...] "evil albinos" [...] appear in {{works of fiction}} from the West. In fiction from Japan, where ideals call for as pale skin as possible, characters with albinism or associated traits are more frequently sympathetic than in American and British fiction. This {{is not to say}} that Japanese popular culture has not depicted [...] "evil albinos". However, such characters in Japanese fiction are often bishōnen or bishōjo whose <b>beautiful</b> <b>appearance</b> gives contrast to their evil character. [...] Use of albinistic features to indicate villains in Hollywood films appears to have begun in the 1960s, and may be related to the popularity of tanning (and thus a decrease in pale skin being seen as attractive) in this period.|$|E
2500|$|The {{appearance}} of Jesus had some theological implications. [...] While some Christians thought Jesus {{should have the}} <b>beautiful</b> <b>appearance</b> of a young classical hero, and the Gnostics tended to think he could change his appearance at will, for which they cited the Meeting at Emmaus as evidence, others including the Church Fathers Justin (d.165) and Tertullian (d.220) believed, following Isaiah:, that Christ's appearance was unremarkable: [...] "he had no form nor comeliness, that we should look upon him, nor beauty that we should delight in him." [...] But when the pagan Celsus ridiculed the Christian religion for having an ugly God in about 180, Origen (d. 248) cited Psalm 45:3: [...] "Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, mighty one, with thy beauty and fairness" [...] Later the emphasis of leading Christian thinkers changed; Jerome (d.420) and Augustine of Hippo (d. 430) argued that Jesus must have been ideally beautiful in face and body. For Augustine he was [...] "beautiful as a child, beautiful on earth, beautiful in heaven." ...|$|E

5000|$|Edward Wilson, {{visiting the}} lake in the 1850s {{described}} it as follows:"Lake Alexandrina is the finest sheet of fresh water I ever saw. Indeed so formidable did it look, with a stiff wind blowing up quite a sufficient swell to make one seasick, that I could scarcely {{believe it to be}} fresh. Such is the fact however. It is forty or fifty miles long by twelve or fifteen wide and the shores around it receded into the dim distance until they become invisible, in the way which we are accustomed only with ideas of salt water. Supplied almost entirely by the Murray, the whole lake retains the muddy tinge of which I have spoken, and this sadly detracts from the otherwise <b>beautiful</b> <b>appearances</b> of this magnificent sheet of water." ...|$|R
