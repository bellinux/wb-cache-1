50|$|The fuel is {{injected}} part-way up the shaft, producing maximum temperature at this point. The fresh feed fed {{in at the}} top is first dried then heated to 800 °C, where de-carbonation begins, and proceeds progressively faster as the temperature rises. Below the burner, the hot lime transfers heat to, and is cooled by, the combustion air. A mechanical grate withdraws the lime at the bottom. A fan draws the gases through the kiln, and the level in the kiln is kept constant by adding feed through an airlock. As with batch kilns, only large, graded stone can be used, {{in order to ensure}} uniform gas-flows through the charge. The degree of burning can be adjusted by changing the rate of withdrawal of lime. Heat consumption as low as 4 MJ/kg is possible, but 4.5 to 5 MJ/kg is more typical.

The study found that the fines always delivered a lower effective alkali in the resulting white liquor, and that the particle sizes of the lime mud were always larger than those originating from the granules, implying that the fines were sintered harder. The industrial consequence is that a dusting lime kiln increases the load on the kiln because the yield of effective alkali is lower; it also introduces a greater dead load into the liquor cycle...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{properties}} of natural raw and industrial waste materials was determined {{in order to}} use them to create hydraulically active belite and belite sulfoaluminate cements. For this purpose, various technologic parameters for manufacture of belite cement were investigated: optimal conditions for hydrothermal synthesis of α-C 2 SH; the kinetics of the products burned at 450 – 1000 °C temperature and their hydration process. In purpose to create belite sulfoaluminate cement there were theorical calculations made for the primary mixture, moreover, clinker‘s burning conditions were determined, ivestigated its hydration process and the impact of the impact of different amounts of gypsum addition to the clinker‘s hydraulic properties. The purpose of this work was to determine the formation of dicalcium silicates during the hydrothermal synthesis and thermal activation, to investigate the impact of mineral composition of the products on the hydraulic activity and to create the mixtures for manufacture of belite and belite sulfoaluminate cements. Mixture which was prepared for belite cement contained of <b>burned</b> <b>lime</b> and burned opoka. The optimal temperature for burning the lime was determined to be 900 °C for 1 h, because under these conditions the biggest amount of free CaO was obtained (82. 5 %). Opoka needs to be burned 775 °C for 1 h (19. 15 % of free CaO). For primary mixture belite sulfoaluminate cement, these materials were used – hard coal fly ash, limestone and anhydrite. The amounts of required primary materials were calculated in order to obtain ~ 70 % β-C 2 S and ~ 25 % ye‘elimite (Ca 4 Al 6 O 12 (SO 4)) during the burning process. α-C 2 SH was synthesized by processing opoka-lime mixture (molar ratio CaO/SiO 2 = 2. 0) under hydrothermal conditions. The optimal conditions of synthesis were determined: duration of the isothermal curing at 200 °C – 12 h, water/solid ratio W/S = 10. 0, stirring speed – 50 RPM. It was found that during the thermal activation of hydrothermal synthesis products at 450 – 1000 °C temperature, forms various polymorphs of dicalium silicates. x-C 2 S and γ-C 2 S were formed and remained stable until 700 and 800 °C, respectively. β-C 2 S starts composing at 600 °C temperature and remains stable even after thermal treatment at 1000 °C, α‘L-C 2 S appears only at 900 °C and the amount of it increases after burning at at 1000 °C. It was determined that during the thermal activation of milled α-C 2 SH and quartz sand mixture phases are changing differently. At 450 °C only x-C 2 S was formed and remained stable until 800 °C, while β-C 2 S started forming at 600 °C, the maximum quantity of it has been reached at 900 °C and most of it transited to α‘L-C 2 S or decomposed to wollastonite at 1000 °C. Calorimetric analysis for α-C 2 SH and α-C 2 SH in mixture with quartz sand, burned at 450 – 1000 °C temperature, was performed. The results showed that samples, burned at 450 – 600 °C temperature have hydraulic properties. According to the results, the most hydraulically active sample is α-C 2 SH in mixture with quartz sand, burned at 450 °C temperature: after 72 h of hydration it released the biggest amount of total heat – 67. 52 J/g. This material is suitable for manufacture of fast curing binder material. During the manufacture of belite sulfoaluminate cement, β-C 2 S and ye‘elimite were obtained during the burning of primary mixture at 1225 – 1275 °C temperature for 1 – 6 h. The amount of these phases dependence on burning conditions was investigated and it showed that increasing the temperature and prolonging the duration of burning does not {{have a significant impact on}} the amounts of these phases: the amount of β-C 2 S increases from 61. 4 to 66. 3 %, ye‘elimite – from 21. 6 to 25. 1 %. For this reason the samples burned at 1225, 1250 and 1275 °C temperature for 1 h were chosen for calorimetric analysis. This analysis showed that the biggest amount of heat after 72 h was released in the sample, burned at 1275 °C temperature – 133. 08 J/g. The influence of different amount of gypsum addition to the clinker‘s hydration was investigated. Three different SO 3 :ye’elimite molar ratios were chosen: 1, 1. 5 and 2 (3. 57, 6. 64 and 9. 52 wt. % of gypsum, respectively). The biggest value of total heat after 72 h of hydration was reached in the sample where SO 3 :ye’elimite molar ratio was equal to 1. 5 – 133. 55 J/g. The mortar strength test after 1, 7 and 28 days was performed and compressive strength was equal to 15. 78, 19. 92 and 20. 70 MPa. The results of this study can be used for the manufacture of environmental-friendly, low burning temperature hydraulic cements...|$|E
40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{world population}} has exerted unprecedented {{pressure on the}} world’s natural ecosystems through both the production and consumption of various products. Human behaviour is having a destructive impact on the environment, and waste generation and disposal {{represents one of the}} key sources of this negative impact. To tackle the problem, a systematic transition towards a circular economy, which is largely built on the possibilities of waste recycling, has been initiated. The continually increasing waste recycling rates can only be achieved by exploiting the advanced waste treatment technologies that are available. However, the operation of such technologies often requires substantial amounts of energy or materials, thereby potentially eliminating the benefits of waste recycling. The primary goal of the research presented in this dissertation was to examine the contribution of the waste pretreatment (PT) activities on the overall environmental impact of waste recycling. An analysis of this nature has not previously been performed on a systematic basis across a variety of waste types and environmental impact categories. The specific objectives of this research study were as follows: (i) to quantify the environmental impact of waste PT activities, (ii) to identify the factors that make the most significant contribution to the impact of the PT activities, (iii) to compare the cumulative induced environmental impact caused by waste PT activities and the final recovery process versus the cumulative avoided impact caused by the conventional disposal of waste and product substitution, and (iv) to identify the potential conditions in which break-even points can be achieved. The goal and the objectives set for this research were achieved by conducting six life cycle assessment (LCA) studies in accordance with the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 international standards. The impact of the recycling or recovery of multiple waste types via a wide number of recycling methods was assessed in terms of the global warming potential (GWP), abiotic depletion potential (ADP), and human toxicity potentials (HTP). The results of the research reveal that, in general, the need to pretreat waste does not increase the environmental impact of waste recycling activities when compared to the conventional disposal in the majority of scenarios and impact categories; however, a significant variation in the relative importance of the PT activities amongst the alternative studies and the impact categories was identified. The lowest relative importance of the PT of 0. 44 - 0. 52 % was achieved for the carcinogenic HTPC in the scenario in which a mineral fraction from the treatment of the municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash (MSWI BA) was recycled via either a road construction or garden stone production process. On the contrary, the highest relative importance of the PT activities of 64 % was recorded for the GWP in the scenario in which phosphorous was recovered from sewage sludge ash. The results of the GWP analysis revealed that the PT activities incorporating advanced waste treatment methods had a significant contribution of 29 - 64 % to the overall impact of the entire waste management systems. On the contrary, the low contribution of PT activities of 0. 3 - 3. 7 % to the overall GWP was recorded when conventional disposal processes that have a high impact on the GWP, such as landfilling of organic waste, were avoided. Furthermore, PT activities could have a low impact on GWP when waste recycling results in the substitution of materials that have substantial carbon footprints; e. g., <b>burned</b> <b>lime</b> or cement. In terms of the ADP, the significant importance of the PT, which ranged from 21 - 36 %, could be expected when the PT activities require a comparatively high amount of fuels, while also having a low impact on conventional disposal and product substitution. On the contrary, the PT activities may have a low contribution of 0. 24 - 1. 2 %, when waste recycling results in the substitution of materials or fuels that have a high impact on the ADP; e. g., phosphorous or cement. Straightforward results were achieved for the carcinogenic HTPC, in which only a low (0. 44 - 0. 52 %) and low-to-moderate (3. 7 - 5. 0 %) share of the overall impact was associated with the PT activities since the toxicity was mainly related to the release of heavy metals during thermal residue recycling processes. On the contrary, a moderate (1. 9 - 9. 2 %) and a significant (12 - 41 %) share of the non-carcinogenic HTPNON-C was associated with the PT activities in situations in which the major contributors were the consumption of fuels required for transporting and incorporating the waste in the final recovery process. The factors that have the largest impact on the contribution of PT activities varied across the studies; however, the variation of the factors studied in the sensitivity analysis revealed that break-even points are seldom achieved. One break-even point was achieved for the GWP in the scenario in which nitrogen recovery was incorporated into the thermally drying of sewage sludge. In this case, the GWP increased from the avoided impact of 18 % to the induced impact of 2. 6 %. Another break-even point was identified for the non-carcinogenic HTPNON-C in the scenario in which the mineral fraction obtained during the treatment of MSWI BA in the garden stone production process was recycled. In this scenario, the avoided HTPNON-C of 14 % transformed into the additional impact of 17 %. It is important to acknowledge an anticipated variation in the inventory data used in the study, which might alter the results achieved. Furthermore, some significant environmental areas of concern were not considered in the research due to limitations in the scope of the study and the inventory data available. Finally, the impact of the system boundaries on the relative importance of the PT should be studied in more depth to achieve comprehensive insights into the relationship between PT activities and environmental impact throughout the entire life cycle of a product...|$|E

50|$|Kilcrea {{railway station}} {{used to be}} a station on the Cork-Macroom line, which {{accommodated}} cargo and passenger trains. In the summer time there used to be excursion trains from Macroom to Youghal. Special cattle trains ran once a month for cattle fairs in Macroom. The farmers of the area used to take their beet to the station to be transported to the sugar factory in Mallow. Coal used to come to the station from Castlecomer in Kilkenny, to be used in Aherla to <b>burn</b> <b>lime</b> and the stout for the local public houses also arrived there. When the thrashing was over in the summer time the threshing sets were transported from Kilcrea to Limerick. The community depended solely on the station until the widespread introduction of cars, after which the necessity of passenger trains decreased and haulage lorries reduced the need for cargo trains. Kilcrea station closed in the 1950s. The station house can still be seen today and is still occupied. The road which runs alongside the station became known as Station House Road, which runs from the N22 towards Aherla.|$|R
