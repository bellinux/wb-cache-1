50|$|Overall, <b>belt</b> <b>machine</b> code is less compact {{than for}} stack machines, which use no operand addresses, but often must {{introduce}} stack-manipulation instructions unneeded on a <b>belt</b> <b>machine.</b> The instructions for accumulator or memory-to-memory machines are not padded out with multiple register fields. Instead, they use compiler-managed anonymous variables for subexpression values. These temps need extra memory reference instructions which take more code space {{than for the}} <b>belt</b> <b>machine.</b> Thus, they produce compact code when used for small memory address spaces, but have no advantage over belt encoding in larger spaces.|$|E
50|$|Belt {{machines}} have smaller instructions {{than other}} common styles of machines, due to not needing a destination address for results. This saving {{can make a}} significant difference for fixed-length instruction formats, which normally use power-of-two instruction widths. If there are thirty-two addressable elements (registers on a general-register machine, belt positions on a <b>belt</b> <b>machine),</b> then each element address occupies five bits in the instruction, needing 15 bits for the three-address format of a general-register machine, but only 10 bits using the two-address format of a <b>belt</b> <b>machine.</b> Because bits are also needed for opcode and other information in the instruction, the (power-of-two constrained) instruction width often determines {{the maximum number of}} addressable elements possible in a design. Typically a <b>belt</b> <b>machine</b> instruction can support the encoding of double the number of addressable elements compared to a general-register machine of the same instruction width. There are similar gains in variable-length instruction encodings.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} engineering and in programming language implementations, a <b>belt</b> <b>machine</b> {{is a real}} or emulated computer that uses a first in, first out (FIFO) queue rather than individual machine processor registers to evaluate each sub-expression in the program. A belt computer is programmed with an instruction set that specifies arguments explicitly but results implicitly.|$|E
50|$|The common {{alternative}} to <b>belt</b> <b>machines</b> are register machines, {{in which each}} instruction explicitly names the specific registers to use for locations of operand arguments and results. <b>Belt</b> <b>machines</b> are related to stack machines, which specify both arguments and results implicitly using a pushdown stack. Other alternatives are accumulator machines, which have only one visible general-purpose temp register, and memory-to-memory machines, which have no visible temp registers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} an {{electrostatic}} generator in which charge is mechanically transported in small amounts into {{the interior of a}} high voltage electrode originated with the Kelvin water dropper, invented during 1867 by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), in which charged drops of water fall into a bucket with the same polarity charge, adding to the charge. In a machine of this type the gravitational force moves the drops against the opposing electrostatic field of the bucket. Kelvin himself first suggested using a belt to carry the charge instead of water. The first electrostatic machine that used an endless belt to transport charge was constructed during 1872 by Augusto Righi. It used an india rubber belt with wire rings along its length as charge carriers, which passed into a spherical metal electrode. The charge was applied to the belt from the grounded lower roller by electrostatic induction using a charged plate. John Gray also invented a <b>belt</b> <b>machine</b> about 1890. [...] Another more complicated <b>belt</b> <b>machine</b> was invented during 1903 by Juan Burboa [...] A more immediate inspiration for Van de Graaff was a generator W. F. G. Swann was developing during the 1920s in which charge was transported to an electrode by falling metal balls, thus returning to the principle of the Kelvin water dropper.|$|E
50|$|While a <b>belt</b> <b>machine</b> {{presents}} an operand queue {{as the program}} model, there {{is not necessarily a}} physical queue (shift register) in the implemented hardware. Instead, a belt design may use an implementation analogous to the register renaming common in modern general-register machines. Live data values are kept in conveniently addressable physical resources (individual registers, register files, static random-access memory (SRAM), or operand forwarding from functional units) and generally not moved for the duration of their belt lifetime. Instruction decoder maps logical belt positions to physical locations. The mapping is updated to reflect the changes of logical position arising from newly dropped results.|$|E
50|$|A <b>belt</b> <b>machine</b> {{implements}} {{temporary storage}} with a fixed-length FIFO queue, or belt by analogy to a conveyor belt. The operands of the arithmetic logic units (ALUs) and other functional units {{may be taken}} from any position on the belt, and the result from the computation is dropped (stored) in the front position of the belt, advancing the belt to make room. As the belt is fixed length, drops in the front are matched by older operands falling off the back; pushed-off operands become inaccessible and must be explicitly saved if still needed for later work. Most operations of the instruction set work only with data on the belt, not on data registers or main memory cells.|$|E

50|$|All <b>belt</b> <b>machines</b> have {{variants}} of the load/store opcodes to access local {{variables and the}} heap. This can be by offsets, from a pointer on the belt, or from various special-purpose base registers. Similarly, there will be instructions to branch to an address taken from the belt, along with branches relative to the program counter.|$|R

50|$|Because each drop of {{a result}} moves the prior belt content along to later {{positions}} in the queue, a given operand continually changes its position (and hence address) {{as a result of}} later execution. In effect, an access to the operand at position zero is a request for the most recent value dropped to the belt, while (for example) a reference to position five is to the sixth most recent drop. Thus the addresses of belt operands reflect the belt history over time. This is temporal addressing. It is hard for human programmers to keep track of belt contents, and hence operand addresses, when writing assembly code for a <b>belt</b> <b>machine.</b> However, it is easy for a compiler to track the changing contents and emit the correct position addresses in generated code.|$|E

This study aims to investigate the scarf-related injuries at a major trauma center in northern India. Methods: From June 2013 to May 2015, a hospital-based prospective observational study was done in patients who presented to a level 1 trauma center in northern India with the mode of injury involving scarf around the neck. Demographic profile, mode of trauma, contributing factors, injury pattern, and the early management as well as early complications were recorded. Results: There were 76 injuries directly related from scarf with the mean age of patients being 32. 4 years. The most common primary factor involved was rotating wheel of motorbike/tricycle (46. 1 %), followed by <b>belt</b> driven <b>machines</b> (28. 9 %). The spectrum of injuries was diverse, including minor abrasions or lacerations (53. 9 %), large lacerations (15. 8 %), fractures and spine trauma (18. 4 %), mangled extremity and amputations (7. 9 %) and death (3. 9 %). More severe injury patterns were noted with <b>belt</b> driven <b>machines.</b> Conclusion: Scarf-related injuries constitute a sizable proportion of trauma, with varying degrees of severity. Devastating consequences in significant proportion of cases dictate the call for a prevention plan comprising both educational and legislative measures.
