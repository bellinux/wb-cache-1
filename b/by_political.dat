5|$|After 1933 {{a career}} in the SS became {{increasingly}} attractive to Germany's social elite, who began joining the movement in great numbers, usually motivated <b>by</b> <b>political</b> opportunism. By 1938 about one-third of the SS leadership were members of the upper middle class. The trend reversed after the first Soviet counter-offensive of 1942.|$|E

5|$|As {{a general}} rule, since that time, {{the armed forces}} have not intervened in {{politics}} as a body, rather being tossed and turned as ambitious men have shaken the country.

5|$|As {{with the}} new keeps {{constructed}} in France, these Anglo-Norman designs were informed both by military thinking and <b>by</b> <b>political</b> drivers. The keep at Orford has been particularly extensively analysed in this regard, and although traditional explanations suggested that its unusual plan {{was the result of}} an experimental military design, more recent analysis concludes that the design was instead probably driven <b>by</b> <b>political</b> symbolism and the need for Henry to dominate the contested lands of East Anglia. The architecture would, for mid-12th century nobility, have summoned up images of King Arthur or Constantinople, then the idealised versions of royal and imperial power. Even formidable military designs such as that at Château Gaillard were built with political effect in mind. Gaillard was designed to reaffirm Angevin authority in a fiercely disputed conflict zone and the keep, although militarily impressive, contained only an anteroom and a royal audience chamber, and was built on soft chalk and without an internal well, both serious defects from a defensive perspective.|$|E
5|$|Chinese society {{during the}} Song dynasty (960–1279) was marked <b>by</b> <b>political</b> and legal reforms, a {{philosophical}} revival of Confucianism, {{and the development}} of cities beyond administrative purposes into centers of trade, industry, and maritime commerce. The inhabitants of rural areas were mostly farmers, although some were also hunters, fishers, or government employees working in mines or the salt marshes. Conversely, shopkeepers, artisans, city guards, entertainers, laborers, and wealthy merchants lived in the county and provincial centers along with the Chinese gentry—a small, elite community of educated scholars and scholar-officials.|$|E

5|$|For its {{coverage}} of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, some (such as Ed Koch) have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As`ad AbuKhalil) have insisted that it is pro-Israel. The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, <b>by</b> <b>political</b> science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges that The New York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel. On the other hand, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized The New York Times for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were claimed to be anti-Semitic.|$|E
5|$|Iceland, {{not part}} of the EU, is {{regarded}} as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It defaulted on its debt and drastically devalued its currency, which has effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive. Lee Harris argues that floating exchange rates allows wage reductions by currency devaluations, a politically easier option than the economically equivalent but politically impossible method of lowering wages <b>by</b> <b>political</b> enactment. Sweden's floating rate currency gives it a short-term advantage, structural reforms and constraints account for longer-term prosperity. Labour concessions, a minimal reliance on public debt, and tax reform helped to further a pro-growth policy.|$|E
