2500|$|Zeitgeist {{received}} mixed reviews, {{indicated by}} {{a score of}} 59/100 on Metacritic. Some negative criticism of the album stemmed from the absence of half of the original lineup, with Pitchfork Media's Rob Mitchum suggesting the name was revived for [...] "cash or attention or both." [...] Qs Paul Rees commented that [...] "at least half of Zeitgeist {{is made up of}} grinding songs that amount to riffs, pummelling and little else," [...] and that Zeitgeists emotional range is [...] "limited and wearing", but praised Chamberlin's drumming, stating that he [...] "remains {{one of the most powerful}} drummers in rock." [...] In addition, Modern Drummer proclaimed that the album contains [...] "Chamberlin's greatest drumming ever put to CD." [...] NME gave it a score of five out of ten and said, [...] "It's best treated as a curio in the Smashing Pumpkins' legacy; and for those who grew up on 'Today', '1979' and 'Ava Adore', you're better left with your memories." [...] The A.V. Club gave it a C+ and said that it [...] "ends up sounding like a Corgan career retrospective in B-side form." [...] musicOMH gave it a score of two-and-a-half stars out of five and said, [...] "Recounting such thoughts, by this point almost an hour has been spent in the company of a record which stares <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> with the appeal of an ex you'd rather not have bumped into." [...] Hot Press gave it a mixed review and said, [...] "The best you can offer is that it’s not a disaster – now do you want to tell Billy or should I?" [...] Robert Christgau simply gave the record a [...] "Dud" [...] rating (...) [...] Slant Magazine gave it a score of two out of five and called it [...] "the Pumpkins' most aggressively metal album to date. But heaps of guitars, vocal overdubs, and ridiculous effects don't mask a lack of inventiveness or even plain ol' quality songwriting." [...] Canadian magazine Now also gave it a score of two stars out of five and called it [...] "no-frills rawk that's been dumbed down for mass consumption." [...] Melodic magazine gave it a score of three stars out of five, calling the album a disappointing return of the band. Tiny Mix Tapes gave it a score of one-and-a-half stars out of five and said that [...] "the mixing problems extend far beyond Corgan's voice. The Band of a Hundred Murderous Guitars has turned into a modern-radio-rock band." ...|$|E

60|$|For {{every chance}} meeting Mooween {{seems to have}} a plan of action ready, which he applies without a {{question}} or an instant's hesitation. Make an unknown sound behind him as he plods along the shore, and he hurls himself headlong into the cover of the bushes, as if your voice had touched a button that released a coiled spring beneath him. Afterwards he may come back to find out what frightened him. Sit perfectly still, and he rises on his hind legs for a look and a long sniff to find out who you are. Jump at him with a yell and a flourish the instant he appears, and he will hurl chips and dirt <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> as he digs his toes into the hillside for a better grip and scrambles away whimpering like a scared puppy.|$|E

60|$|At Savernake {{there is}} nothing so {{humanised}} as the pig, even of the old type; you may roam for long hours and see no man and no domestic animal. You have heard that this domain is the property of some person, {{but it seems like}} a fiction. The forest is nature's and yours. There you are at liberty to ramble all day unchallenged by any one; to walk, and run to warm yourself; to disturb a herd of red deer, or of fallow deer, which are more numerous; to watch them standing still to gaze <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> then all with one impulse move rapidly away, showing their painted tails, keeping a kind of discipline, row behind row, moving over the turf with that airy tripping or mincing gait that strikes you as quaint and somewhat bird-like. Or you may coil yourself up, adder-like, beside a thick hawthorn bush, or at the roots of a giant oak or beech, and enjoy the vernal warmth, while outside of your shelter the wind blows bleak and loud.|$|E
60|$|Now {{gathered}} the clouds above my unconscious head. That divine echo, since known {{throughout the world}} as the Great Koh-i-noor, or Mountain of Repetitions, was discovered. It was a sixty-five carat gem. You could utter a word and it would talk <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> for fifteen minutes, when the day was otherwise quiet. But behold, another fact came to light at the same time: another echo-collector was in the field. The two rushed to make the peerless purchase. The property consisted {{of a couple of}} small hills with a shallow swale between, out yonder among the back settlements of New York State. Both men arrived on the ground at the same time, and neither knew the other was there. The echo was not all owned by one man; a person by the name of Williamson Bolivar Jarvis owned the east hill, and a person by the name of Harbison J. Bledso owned the west hill; the swale between was the dividing-line. So while my uncle was buying Jarvis's hill for three million two hundred and eighty-five thousand dollars, the other party was buying Bledso's hill for a shade over three million.|$|E
60|$|I am {{now going}} back to {{my first visit to}} this green retreat; it was in the course of one of those Easter walks I have spoken of, and the way was through Reading and by Three Mile Cross and Swallowfield. On this {{occasion}} I conceived a dislike to Reading which I have never quite got over, for it seemed an unconscionably big place for two slow pedestrians to leave behind. Worse still, when we did leave it we found that Reading would not leave us. It was like a stupendous octopus in red brick which threw out red tentacles, miles and miles long in various directions--little rows and single and double cottages and villas, all in red, red brick and its weary accompaniment, the everlasting hard slate roof. These square red brick boxes with sloping slate tops are built {{as close as possible to}} the public road, so that the passer-by looking in at the windows may see the whole interior--wall-papers, pictures, furniture, and oftentimes the dull expressionless face of the woman of the house, staring <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> out of her shallow blue eyes. The weather too was against us; a grey hard sky, like the slate roofs, and a cold strong east wind to make the road dusty all day long.|$|E

6000|$|Speaking of our pilgrims {{reminds me}} that we {{have one or two}} people among us who are {{sometimes}} an annoyance. However, I do not count the Oracle in that list. I will explain that the Oracle is an innocent old ass who eats for four and looks wiser than the whole Academy of France would have any right to look, and never uses a one-syllable word when he can think of a longer one, and never by any possible chance knows the meaning of any long word he uses or ever gets it in the right place; yet he will serenely venture an opinion on the most abstruse subject and back it up complacently with quotations from authors who never existed, and finally when cornered will slide {{to the other side of}} the question, say he has been there all the time, and come <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> with your own spoken arguments, only with the big words all tangled, and play them in your very teeth as original with himself. He reads a chapter in the guidebooks, mixes the facts all up, with his bad memory, and then goes off to inflict the whole mess on somebody as wisdom which has been festering in his brain for years and which he gathered in college from erudite authors who are dead now and out of print. This morning at breakfast he pointed out of the window and said: ...|$|E
60|$|A {{far more}} {{singular}} walking fish {{than any of}} these is the odd creature that rejoices (unfortunately) in the very classical surname of Periophthalmus, which is, being interpreted, Stare-about. (If he had a recognised English name of his own, I would gladly give it; but as he hasn't, and as it is clearly necessary to call him something, I fear we must stick to the somewhat alarming scientific nomenclature.) Periophthalmus, then, is an odd fish of the tropical Pacific shores, with a pair of very distinct forelegs (theoretically described as modified pectoral fins), and with two goggle eyes, which he can protrude at pleasure right outside the sockets, so as to look in whatever direction he chooses, without even taking the trouble to turn his head to left or right, backward or forward. At ebb tide this singular peripatetic goby literally walks straight out of the water, and promenades the bare beach erect on two legs, in search of small crabs and other stray marine animals left behind by the receding waters. If you try to catch him, he hops away briskly much like a frog, and stares <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> grimly over his left shoulder, with his squinting optics. So completely adapted is he for this amphibious long-shore existence, that his big eyes, unlike those of most other fish, are formed for seeing in the air {{as well as in the}} water. Nothing can be more ludicrous than to watch him suddenly thrusting these very movable orbs right out of their sockets like a pair of telescopes, and twisting them round in all directions so as to see in front, behind, on top, and below, in one delightful circular sweep.|$|E
