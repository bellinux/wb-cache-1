5|$|Woodward’s own {{judgment}} {{of the war and}} of Bush doesn’t really matter. In the course of four books he has given readers the conversations and documents we need to reach our {{own judgment}}s. He has also, however unevenly and imperfectly, supplied enough synthesis and analysis to make that judgment genuinely informed. Sure, these <b>books</b> <b>can</b> be a slog. But they stand as the fullest story yet of the Bush presidency and of the war that is likely to be its most important legacy.|$|E

This is perhaps a more common method for covers made with book-cloth although leather <b>books</b> <b>can</b> be approached this way as well. Materials such as Japanese tissues of various weights may be used. Colors may be matched using acrylic paints or simple colored pencils.|$|E

The banners carried by Gondorian cavalry and infantry are black pennants, with the White Tree and three white stars.|$|E

One of Mercereau's <b>books</b> <b>can</b> be seen in the painting, along with the still-life next to the sitter, the man, and the environment. All are symbols of fundamental importance to Gleizes, an artist who rarely, if ever, contented himself with mundane subjects.|$|E
