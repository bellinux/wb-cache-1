50|$|The first joist in 1923 was a Warren truss type, {{with top}} and bottom chords of round bars and a web formed from a single {{continuous}} <b>bent</b> <b>bar.</b> Various other types were developed, but problems also followed because each manufacturer had their own design and fabrication standards. Architects, engineers and builders {{found it difficult to}} compare rated capacities and to use fully the economies of steel joist construction. Members of the industry began to organize the Institute, and in 1928 the first standard specifications were adopted, followed in 1929 by the first load table. The joists covered by these early standards were later identified as open web steel joists, SJ-Series.|$|E
50|$|When Edward Alleyn {{founded the}} school {{he was awarded}} a coat of arms and crest. This {{was used by the}} school until, in 1935, it was decreed by the College of Arms that it was the {{exclusive}} property of Edward Alleyn and his family. The new arms granted by the College of Arms were very similar to the old ones retaining most of the features. Deism and learning are represented by the flames in the crest. From the ring of flames an arm with a hand holding a heart protrudes. This probably symbolises charity and has a twofold meaning. First, it represents Alleyn's charitable intentions, and second it recalls Alleyn's famous speech, written by Ben Jonson, when he presented King James I with the flaming heart of London during The Magnificent Entertainment, involving a procession through the streets and through triumphal arches by which the City of London welcomed King James I from Scotland in 1604.

One of them mimics a galactic bar with two spiral arms at its tips. It is showed that if the bending function is a linear combination of Legendre polynomials, then the bent potential is an exact solution of the Laplace equation. A transformation is applied on the thin <b>bent</b> <b>bars</b> to generate three-dimensional potential-density pairs without singularities. The potentials of the thin <b>bent</b> <b>bars</b> are also used to generate non-axisymmetric planar distributions of matter. Comment: 25 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

The relevancy of particular RIE on the choice deformation characteristic bars in dependence on the ration of central line length and characteristic cross-section proportions, support type and bar load is analyzed in the sample examples. We solve a problem whether a <b>bent</b> <b>bar</b> should be comprehended as a shall bent or as a forte <b>bent</b> <b>bar</b> and we also analyze how does the stiffness shift influence the fractional bar deformation.

40|$|A well characterised {{residual}} stress distribution resulting from four point bending has been analysed using the neutron diffraction technique. Residual stresses {{were obtained from}} the strains measured at discrete positions through the <b>bent</b> <b>bar</b> on the (111) and (311) crystal planes of a nickel base alloy using the appropriate Diffraction Elastic Constants. In addition a profile refinement method was used to determine the {{residual stress}}es from average strains from all the diffraction peaks in the spectrum. The measured residual stress profiles have also been compared with strain gauge data and with analytical and finite element predictions. It has been established that the profile refinement approach gives stresses which most closely match those obtained by the non-diffraction techniques.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a technique for generating concise neural network models of physical systems. The neural network models are generated through a two-stage process. The first stage uses information {{embedded in the}} dimensions or units in which the data is represented. Dimensional analysis techniques are used initially to make this information explicit, and a limited search in the neural network architecture space is then conducted to determine dimensionless representations of variables/parameters that perform well for a given model complexity. The second stage uses information available in the numerical values of the data to search for high-level dimensionless variables/parameters, generated from simple combinations of dimensionless quantities generated {{in the first stage}} and which result in concise neural network models with improved performance characteristics. The search for these high-level dimensionless variables/parameters is conducted in an enhanced representation space using functional link networks with flat or near flat architectures. The use and effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated for three applications. The first is the design and analysis of reinforced concrete beams, which is representative of the class of problems associated with the design and analysis of composites. The second is the classical elastica problem, for predicting non-linear post-buckled behaviour of columns and the third, the analysis of a <b>bent</b> <b>bar</b> under a specified combination of loads...|$|E
40|$|Pectus excavatum is {{the most}} common {{deformity}} of the thorax. A minimally invasive surgical correction is commonly carried out to remodel the anterior chest wall by using an intrathoracic convex prosthesis in the substernal position. The process of prosthesis modeling and bending still remains an area of improvement. The authors developed a new system, i 3 DExcavatum, which can automatically model and bend the bar preoperatively based on a thoracic CT scan. This article presents a comparison between automatic and manual bending. The i 3 DExcavatum was used to personalize prostheses for 41 patients who underwent pectus excavatum surgical correction between 2007 and 2012. Regarding the anatomical variations, the soft-tissue thicknesses external to the ribs show that both symmetric and asymmetric patients always have asymmetric variations, by comparing the patients’ sides. It highlighted that the prosthesis bar should be modeled according to each patient’s rib positions and dimensions. The average differences between the skin and costal line curvature lengths were 84 ± 4 mm and 96 ± 11 mm, for male and female patients, respectively. On the other hand, the i 3 DExcavatum ensured a smooth curvature of the surgical prosthesis and was capable of predicting and simulating a virtual shape and size of the bar for asymmetric and symmetric patients. In conclusion, the i 3 DExcavatum allows preoperative personalization according to the thoracic morphology of each patient. It reduces surgery time and minimizes the margin error introduced by the manually <b>bent</b> <b>bar,</b> which only uses a template that copies the chest wall curvature...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{numerical}} and experimental investigation of residual stress and deformation in polycrystalline metallic alloys at different scales. The emphasis in the current study is placed on establishing the connection between the simulation of deformation by the Finite Element (FE) method and experimental characterisation by synchrotron X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Of particular importance is the interpretation of modelling results and their validation by careful comparison with experimental data. The concept of eigenstrain was used extensively throughout the report to study the residual elastic strain distributions and their sources. A pseudo-thermal strain FE procedure was used systematically to simulate the residual stress states in samples and engineering components of different shape and dimensionality. The case of 1 -D strain variation was considered using the example of a plastically <b>bent</b> <b>bar.</b> The direct and inverse problems of eigenstrain analysis were solved, and validated experimentally by the use of XRD and EDM slitting methods. A novel 2 -D discrete inverse eigenstrain algorithm was proposed and implemented to reconstruct the residual stress distribution in a worn rail head. The link between the residual stress and deformation history was studied via thermo-mechanical modelling of the Linear Friction Welding (LFW) process. To advance the understanding of polycrystalline deformation behaviour across the scales, a crystal plasticity model was employed to simulate the elastic-plastic deformation behaviour of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. A post-processor was developed to extract the average elastic strains for orientation-specific grain groups and to compare them with XRD data. A “peak constructor” post-processor was developed that utilised the knowledge of both the elastic strain and dislocation density. In a further development step, a strain gradient crystal plasticity formulation was adopted to account for the local dislocation evolution. Intra-granular deformation analysis was carried out and micro-beam Laue experimental diffraction technique was used for validation. Thus, local lattice arrangement was studied at the microscopic, intragranular scale. Special attention was paid to the phenomenon of Laue spot “streaking”, indicative of the local lattice misorientation caused by dislocation activity during deformation. The results presented in this thesis contributed to the fundamental understanding of the residual stress and deformation in polycrystalline metallic alloys and lead to more than 20 publications in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings, which are listed in the Appendix.

40|$|With {{regard to}} the {{processing}} of structural lightweight components there exists an increasing demand {{for the application of}} magnesium base wrought alloys, which are highly textured due to the forming process. However, magnesium has a poor deformability at room temperature due to the hexagonal structure that limits its application considerably. Although the focus of recent research activities is on investigations of the texture evolution and the mechanical behaviour of magnesium base alloys during processing and in service, there still exists a lack of understanding of their mechanical-technological characteristics e. g. the knowledge about the deformability or the cyclic deformation behaviour with respect to the initial crystallographic texture. The deformation behaviour during cyclic loading of the highly textured hot rolled magnesium base wrought alloy AZ 31 was investigated in-situ during elasto-plastic 4 -point-bending using energy dispersive diffraction. Loading or residual stress distributions were determined for one load cycle including loading, load release and load reversion. The experiments were carried out at the energy dispersive diffraction beamline EDDI at Bessy II, Berlin. The results obtained for the multitude of reflexions being recorded simultaneously in one single diffraction spectrum clearly indicate the elastic isotropic behaviour of the textured alloy. For elasto-plastically <b>bent</b> <b>bars</b> a strong plastic anisotropy was observed leading to a distinct shift of the neutral fibre of the bars.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of typical connections commonly used in precast concrete buildings subjected to reversed cyclic loads is presented, along with an analytical study of nonlinear behaviour of these specimens subjected to monotonically increasing loads until failure. Five different connection specimens were constructed and tested under reversed cyclic loading to determine their seismic responses. The specimens represent a series of horizontal connections between double-tee flanges or between a double-tee flange and lateral load resisting element in a typical roof of a precast concrete structure. The analytical study consisted of two parts: linear finite element analysis of the connection to determine the test specimen geometry and to define its boundary conditions, and non-linear finite element analysis, using the NONLACS program, to predict the complete responses of the connections subjected to monotonically increasing loads. The experimental results were compared with the predictions made using theoretical calculations, the CPCI design method and non-linear finite element analysis. It is noted that the CPCI design method gives conservative predictions for the ultimate strength of the connection reinforced with a <b>bent</b> deformed <b>bar</b> anchor and a 90 $ sp circ$ hook, and the one with two deformed bars oriented at 45 $ sp circ$ and headed studs, both welded to a steel plate.
