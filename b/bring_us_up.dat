6000|$|... "The road is too long, {{the weather}} is apt to be too thick, and the coast is too {{dangerous}} for us, Moses. We have but two expedients to choose between--to turn our heads to the westward, {{and try to get}} home, trusting to luck to <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> with some American who will help us, or steer due east and run for a French port--Bordeaux for instance--where we might either dispose of the cargo, or ship a new crew, and sail for our port of destination." ...|$|E

They <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> to take life easily, and then, when some accident pitches us out into the Colonies, it's rather a shock to discover that nobody seems to have any use for us. As a matter of fact, I don't blame your sawmill bosses, your railroad men and your ranchers, considering that it takes several years to learn how to chop a tree, and that to keep pace with an average construction gang is a liberal education." ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{came the}} Civil War. (I must {{condense}} this historical interpolation.) Stonewall Jackson was shot; Lee surrendered; Grant toured the world; cotton went to nine cents; Old Crow whiskey and Jim Crow cars were invented; the Seventy-ninth Massachusetts Volunteers {{returned to the}} Ninety-seventh Alabama Zouaves the battle flag of Lundy's Lane which they bought at a second-hand store in Chelsea, kept {{by a man named}} Skzchnzski; Georgia sent the President a sixty-pound watermelon--and that <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> to the time when the story begins.

50|$|The NDEA was {{influenced}} by the Soviet launch of the satellite Sputnik on October 4, 1957. U.S. citizens feared that education in the USSR was superior to that in the United States, and Congress reacted by adding the act to <b>bring</b> <b>U.S.</b> schools <b>up</b> to speed.|$|R
6000|$|... "The air got bitterly cold {{all of a}} sudden; {{and though}} we could not see above a mile {{anywhere}} round us, we were pretty sure {{we were in the}} neighbourhood of ice. Towards the afternoon of the tenth day the weather cleared just a little, though the wind seemed as high as ever, and we caught sight of some big bergs. The captain, who was as good a sort as ever sailed, had done his best all along to keep up our spirits. The cook had been washed overboard in his caboose; but the skipper had kept his steward at work boiling water over a little spirit-stove he had aft, and kept a supply of hot coffee there at all hours for us; and with that and biscuits we had got on fairly well. Now he told us that he thought the gale would soon blow itself out, and that as soon as it abated enough to set a rag or two of sail he would try and <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> under the lee of a berg.|$|E
6000|$|After the puddings, {{sweet and}} black, the fritters and soup, came the third course, {{of which the}} chief dish was a hot venison pasty, which was put before Lord Smart, and carved by that nobleman. Besides the pasty, there was a hare, a rabbit, some pigeons, partridges, a goose, and a ham. Beer and wine were freely imbibed during this course, the gentlemen always {{pledging}} somebody with every glass which they drank; and {{by this time the}} conversation between Tom Neverout and Miss Notable had grown so brisk and lively, that the Derbyshire baronet began to think the young gentlewoman was Tom’s sweetheart; on which Miss remarked, that she loved Tom “like pie”. After the goose, some of the gentlemen took a dram of brandy, “which was very good for the wholesomes,” Sir John said; and now having had a tolerably substantial dinner, honest Lord Smart bade the butler bring up the great tankard full of October to Sir John. The great tankard was passed from hand to hand and mouth to mouth, but when pressed by the noble host upon the gallant Tom Neverout, he said, “No faith, my lord, I like your wine, and won’t put a churl upon a gentleman. Your honour’s claret is good enough for me.” And so, the dinner over, the host said, “Hang saving, <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> a ha’porth of cheese.” ...|$|E

40|$|Since two yachts first sailed on {{the same}} stretch of water, and due to the {{competitive}} nature of man, {{it was only a}} matter of time until someone came up with the idea of a handicap system to allow different types of vessel the opportunity to race against each other on a level playing field.
