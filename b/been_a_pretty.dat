500|$|Bowie was not {{concerned}} with the album's relative poor performance in the charts, saying [...] "I've made about 20 albums during my career, and so far this is my third biggest seller. So I can't be that disappointed, yet, it is a letdown that it hasn't been as buoyant as it should be. ... But I don’t really feel that negative about it. As far as I'm concerned it's {{one of the better}} albums I've made. As I've said. Never Let Down has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> big seller for me. So I'm quite happy." [...] Despite growing criticism in the press, Bowie said that Never Let Me Down {{was one of the most}} enjoyable and energetic albums he had made in a long time.|$|E
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{wrote that}} the quality of the episode hinged on whether or not the viewer could accept the fact that the {{characters}} were unaware of the extent of the footage that the camera crew caught. He wrote that [...] "If you can ride with the Scranton branch not understanding what 'being filmed all the time' means, this might have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> funny episode. If you can't ... then the premise of this episode is pretty awful." [...] He concluded that while [...] "Promos" [...] had [...] "its moments", it was not the most solid of the series' episodes. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix felt that [...] "there was good idea hiding inside of 'The Promo' [...] ", but that much of the episode was undermined by the broad nature of the humor.|$|E
500|$|In September 1976, Alston {{announced}} that he would retire {{at the end of the}} season. At a press conference, Alston said, [...] "I've been in baseball for 41 years and it's been awfully good to me. This has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> big day. I had three birdies playing golf for the first time in my life and now I'm announcing that I'm stepping down as manager. I told Peter this afternoon to give somebody else a chance to manage the club." [...] Alston retired with 2,063 wins (2,040 in the regular season and 23 in the postseason). Alston was named NL Manager of the Year six times. He also managed NL All-Star squads a record nine times and won seven of those games. At a time when multi-year contracts were on the rise, Alston's managerial career consisted of 23 one-year contracts. He earned seven NL pennants in that span.|$|E

He Bishop {{put us in a}} situation where we had to watch what he was doing, every five minutes, otherwise he'd do something we didn't want him to do ... we recorded during the day, played gigs at night and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lot of intensity and grinding poverty. So it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> intense process. And he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> intense guy too, but not necessarily in a positive way." ...|$|R

500|$|Bandslam was The Washington Post's critic choice, {{having a}} perfect score of 4/4 stars. Bandslam was somehow {{associated}} with High School Musical {{in a couple}} of reviews. However, the reviews concluded the comparisons positively, saying that Bandslam was [...] "actually a lot quirkier than the posters would have you believe." [...] New Jersey's local newspaper, The Star Ledger says that the plot is nicely skewed: [...] "Basically, it's the standard teen picture – girl torn between bad boy and nice guy – with a gender switch." [...] Michael Phillips of The Los Angeles Times praised the film by saying: [...] "Bandslam is a pretty good movie given that the odds of it having <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> bad movie were steep." [...] Critic Andy Webster of The New York Times said that Bandslam may not entirely break new teen-movie ground, but it does offer intriguing glimpses of performers ready to bolt from the Disney stable.|$|E
500|$|In a {{simultaneous}} {{review of the}} shows in Fox's Animation Domination block, Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club praised the episode for having [...] "some actual plot and continuity". She concluded her review, writing: [...] "Jillian has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good addition to the Family Guy universe, and I think I'm actually sad to see her and Brian break up." [...] She graded the episode B+, the second-highest grade of the night. Ahsan Haque of IGN wrote that the episode [...] "managed to rise about the generic plotline and deliver a pretty solid half-hour of entertainment that told a cohesive (and somewhat sad) main story, with just enough gags {{to fill in the}} rest of the time." [...] Haque graded the episode 7.8 out of 10, and wrote that it was [...] "definitely sad to see the end of the Brian and Jillian relationship, especially considering the great performance put on by Drew Barrymore." [...] Brad Trechak of TV Squad called it [...] "a fairly pedestrian episode with a few cute gags".|$|E
2500|$|On a {{publicity}} tour for Past Mortem in 2004, Elton mused {{on the high}} school reunion theme and his own drama college reunion: We'd had a very happy time all together, so there were no old scores to be settled really, we'd <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> happy bunch. And yet one person, who'd been a bit of a golden boy – he certainly went out with a girl I was besotted and unrequitedly in love with – he came up and he said, 'Why did you come? Was it to show off?' That really surprised me, that anyone would think that ... he came kind of carrying my agenda. It was weird. I hasten to add I didn't think my life to be more successful than anybody else's. If you're happy and honest and fulfilled in what you do, then you're having a successful life.|$|E

2500|$|GameSpy's Benjamin Turner scored it 2.5 out of 5, writing [...] "The {{designers}} [...] {{attempting to}} create something unique by combining gameplay ideas from platformers, 3D shooters, vehicular action games and even Marble Madness. While the end result doesn't quite gel, I have to {{appreciate the fact that}} they tried." [...] However, he noted that [...] "rather than excelling, it ends up doing a fairly mediocre job of almost everything." [...] He called the platforming sections [...] "rough around the edges," [...] criticizing the collision detection and level design, and was unimpressed with Haven's mag-ball. He concluded [...] "there's just too much mediocrity and not enough quality. With a ton of tweaking and a heavy dose of polish this could have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good game. I get the sense that the creators' hearts were in the right places, but for whatever reason they couldn't execute. Their creation feels unfinished." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} film {{three and a}} half stars out of four, saying, [...] "Schumer and Hader are {{wonderful}} together. Gender inequity in the world of comedy deserves all the overdue attention it's getting, and more. But there are matters of craft, wit (no matter how crude the jokes) and timing that transcend chromosomes." [...] Richard Roeper of The Chicago Sun Times praised the performances of the cast, particularly Schumer, Hader, Quinn, and James. He also called Schumer's performance worthy of an Academy Award nomination. [...] Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars, stating, [...] "Judd Apatow's latest is rough around the edges, but his focus on a female protagonist refreshes a genre in sore need of change". Ian Crouch, writing for The New Yorker, singled out LeBron James' performance for praise, writing that [...] "it seems safe to declare that he has given the greatest motion-picture acting performance by an active professional basketball player of all time." [...] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+, saying, [...] "Beneath all of his bad-boy shtick, Apatow's always <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> conventional moralist. But Schumer gives their raunchy rom-com enough of her signature spikiness to prevent it from ever feeling predictable." [...] Jacob Hall of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of five stars, saying, [...] "Schumer raises Apatow's game beautifully. Her biting, pitch-black wit and his penchant for character-driven comedy go together like gin and tonic." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying [...] "Sweet is not how Schumer wants Trainwreck to go down. She wants to explode rom-com clichés and replace them with something fierce and ready to rumble. Done." ...|$|E
