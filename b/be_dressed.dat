The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to Jötunheimr together.|$|E

5|$|While Miller {{was working}} on a BBC Three sitcom he pitched the idea to {{producer}} Stephen McCrum. McCrum criticised the way Miller ended the first script, which ended with Nelson and Marion leave where they live. McCrum told him it was best to set the series in a single place rather than have the characters move from one place to another. McCrum then suggested taking Nelson and Marion, and writing a script about them. Later, another writer, Jon Brown came in to write and at this time rules were set out with regards to writing the show, such as the animals could not <b>be</b> <b>dressed</b> in clothes unless it was in a flashback sequence or during a song.|$|E

5|$|The Muisca played music, {{sang and}} danced mainly {{as part of}} religious, burial and {{initiation}} rituals, with harvests and sowing and after the victory in battles.

The main deities associated with the dances were Huitaca and Nencatacoa.|$|E
5|$|Cincinnati {{already had}} a large anti-slavery {{movement}} who had violent conflicts with slavery proponents {{in the years before}} Coffin moved to the city. Coffin purchased a new home at the corner of Elm and Sixth Streets and continued to be active in the Underground Railroad. He also set up a new safe house in the city and helped organize a larger network in the area. At first he was very cautious about helping escaping slaves in the area until he was able to find local people he could trust and the community learned that it could trust him. Although Coffin and his wife moved several times during their years in Cincinnati, they finally settled at a home on Wehrman Street. With the large home's rooms rented out for boarding and its many guests coming and going, the home provided an excellent place to operate an Underground Railroad stop without arousing much suspicion. When fugitives arrived they would <b>be</b> <b>dressed</b> as butlers, cooks, and other workers in uniforms that Catherine had created. Some mulattoes were able to pass as white guests. The most frequent disguise was a Quaker woman's attire; its high collar, long sleeves, gloves, veil, and a large, wide-brimmed hat could completely hide its wearer when their head was tilted slightly downward.|$|E
