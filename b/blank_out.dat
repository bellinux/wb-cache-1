25|$|The {{team had}} {{originally}} {{predicted that the}} system would have a practical detection range {{on the order of}} , but never managed to stretch this much beyond 3 miles. Much of this was due to the inefficient system being used to <b>blank</b> <b>out</b> the receiver during the transmission pulse, which wasted most of the radio energy. This final piece of the puzzle was provided by Arthur Cooke, who suggested using the Sutton tube filled with a dilute gas as a switch, replacing the spark gap system. During transmission, the power of the magnetron would cause the gas to ionise, presenting an almost perfect radio mirror that would prevent the signal from reaching the output. When the pulse ended the gas would rapidly de-ionise, allowing signals to flow across (or around) the cavity and reach the output. Skinner took up development of the concept with Ward and Starr, initially trying helium and hydrogen, but eventually settling on a tiny amount of water vapour and argon. The resulting design, known as a soft Sutton tube, went into production as the CV43 and the first examples arrived in the summer of 1941.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, {{the private}} Yahoo! Mail account of Sarah Palin, Republican vice presidential {{candidate}} in the 2008 United States presidential election, was hacked by a 4chan user. This followed criticism of Palin and other politicians supposedly using private email accounts for governmental work. The hacker posted the account's password on /b/, and screenshots from within the account to Wikileaks. A /b/ user then logged in and changed the password, posting a screenshot of his sending an email {{to a friend of}} Palin's informing her of the new password on the /b/ thread. However, he forgot to <b>blank</b> <b>out</b> the password in the screenshot. A multitude of /b/ users attempted to log in with the new password, and the account was automatically locked out by Yahoo!. The incident was criticized by some /b/ users, in that most reports on the hack focused on 4chan, rather than Palin's violation of campaign law. One user commented, [...] "seriously, /b/. We could have changed history and failed, epically." [...] The FBI and Secret Service began investigating the incident shortly after its occurrence. On September 20 it was revealed they were questioning David Kernell, the son of Democratic Tennessee State Representative Mike Kernell.|$|E

50|$|Synchronizing {{rings are}} made of metal and can be {{provided}} with anti-wear coatings called a friction lining.Common metals for synchronizer rings are brass and steel. The linings typically consist of molybdenum, iron, bronze or carbon.The synchronizing rings are produced either by massive forming (common forging) or sheet metal shaping. The latter involves the stamping of the <b>blank</b> <b>out</b> of a sheet metal strip and the subsequent machining with follow-on composite tools or transfer tools. A friction lining usually consists of thermally splashed molybdenum. Alternatively, iron or bronze sinter friction layers can be used. Carbon-coated synchronizer rings are particularly wear resistant and offer very good friction behavior. Due to their higher price, these are reserved for high-performance transmissions.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{multiplicity}} of sources for these practices, the Egyptian authorities and even the Siwan tribal elders have attempted to repress the historical and anthropological record. When the Siwa-born anthropologist Fathi Malim included reference to Siwan homosexuality (especially a love poem from a man to a youth) in his book Oasis Siwa (2001), the tribal council demanded that he <b>blank</b> <b>out</b> the material in the current edition {{of the book and}} remove it from future editions, or be expelled from the community. Malim reluctantly agreed and physically deleted the passages in the first edition of his book, and excluded them from the second. A newer book Siwa Past and Present (2005) by A. Dumairy, the Director of Siwa Antiquities, discreetly omits all mention of the famous historical practices of the inhabitants.|$|E

50|$|Scarlet realises {{that the}} note sets out the Mysteron agent's {{assassination}} schedule: Olafson was attacked first, {{meaning that the}} second target is President John L.

Carney evades all Spectrum efforts to apprehend him as he drives to the Maximum Security Centre containing Henderson, smashing through Captain Magenta's roadblock and using a device to <b>blank</b> <b>out</b> the monitor in Scarlet and Blue's Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle. At the security centre, the officers find themselves cut off from all external contact when Carney flies an adapted remote-controlled miniature plane over the complex, jamming radio signals in the area.

However, on entering Henderson's suite, the reconstruction fails to notice a tripwire, stumbles and is shot down by Scarlet. For all Carney's electronics expertise, his duplicate was ultimately defeated by a simple security measure.|$|E
