5|$|After the Second World Congress in 1948, the International Secretariat {{attempted}} to open communications with Josip Broz Tito's regime in Yugoslavia.

5|$|Before the {{publication}} of Industrial Society and Its Future, Ted Kaczynski's brother, David Kaczynski, was encouraged by his wife Linda {{to follow up on}} suspicions that Ted was the Unabomber.

He browsed through old family papers and found letters dating back to the 1970s written <b>by</b> <b>Ted</b> and sent to newspapers protesting the abuses of technology and which contained phrasing similar to that found in Industrial Society and Its Future.|$|E

5|$|The WWWF {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF), and Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) between the 1970s and 1980s, and as a result, created and lent titles to these promotions. In 1979, the promotion renamed itself to the WWF and six years later ended its partnerships with NJPW and UWF. This resulted in the retirement of one UWF and three NJPW lent titles: the WWF International Heavyweight Championship (UWF), WWF Junior Heavyweight Championship, WWF World Martial Arts Heavyweight Championship, and WWF International Tag Team Championship (NJPW). The company also ceased operations of three short-lived titles: the WWF North American Heavyweight Championship (1979–1981), WWF Canadian Championship (1985–1986), and WWF Women's Tag Team Championship (1983–1989). Despite their names, the geographic-name-based titles were not restricted to wrestlers from that location. During the 1990s, the WWF ended {{its relationship with the}} UWA; as a result, the WWF Intercontinental Tag Team Championship was abandoned, while the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship (which UWA possessed) was reactivated in the United States for use by the WWF. In 1996, the Million Dollar Championship, a title created <b>by</b> <b>Ted</b> DiBiase, was retired, although it was never sanctioned by the WWF, but was reintroduced briefly in 2010 <b>by</b> <b>Ted</b> DiBiase Jr.|$|E
