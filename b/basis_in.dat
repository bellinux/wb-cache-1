Working Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to further debate. Asset allocation decisions of international investors are at the core of capital flows. This paper explores the impact of these decisions on long-term government bond yields, using a quarterly investor base dataset for 22 advanced economies over 2004 ‒ 2012. We find that a one percentage point increase in the share of government debt held by foreign investors can explain a 6 ‒ 10 <b>basis</b> point reduction <b>in</b> long-term sovereign bond yields over the sample period. Accordingly, international flows to core advanced economy bond markets over 2008 ‒ 12 are estimated to have reduced 10 -year government bond yields by 40 ‒ 65 <b>basis</b> points <b>in</b> Germany, 20 ‒ 30 <b>basis</b> points <b>in</b> the U.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the dynamic {{dependence}} between change <b>in</b> <b>basis</b> and change <b>in</b> liquidity by employing a copula approach. Using trading volume of the S&P 500 index as a proxy of stock market liquidity, {{we find that the}} dynamic dependence varies significantly through time, a range from negative value to positive value. In addition, the dependence is asymmetric in which the lower tail dependence is zero and the upper tail dependence is positive. The results suggest that an increase in liquidity is not always associated with a decrease <b>in</b> <b>basis.</b> At the extreme situation, the link between change <b>in</b> <b>basis</b> and change <b>in</b> liquidity can be broken down.
