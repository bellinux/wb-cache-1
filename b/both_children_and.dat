Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of gastroenteritis in <b>both</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> adults is rehydration. This is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution, although intravenous delivery {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe. Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on simple sugars. Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase diarrhea. Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or the person is not willing to drink them. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted. In those who require intravenous fluids, one to four hours' worth is often sufficient.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In India, child {{mortality}} rates for girls {{are much higher}} than those for boys, indicating discrimination against girls in the intra-household allocation of resources. In addition, overall {{child mortality}} rates remain high {{in many parts of}} the country. This paper attempts to understand important predictors of <b>both</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> excessive female <b>child</b> mortality in India, with a focus on variables relating to maternal agency and education. Attempts are made to isolate the precise channels through which mother’s education influences survival probabilities of children, particularly, girls in India. Overall education effects are decomposed into autonomy, information and other effects and then regressed on <b>child</b> <b>and</b> excessive female <b>child</b> mortality variables in India. It is found that while information effects of education are important in <b>both</b> <b>child</b> mortality <b>and</b> excess female <b>child</b> mortality regressions; autonomy enhancing effects of education are much more important in predicting excess female child mortality than child mortality as a whole. In addition, even after controlling for autonomy and information effects, education significantly <b>and</b> negatively affects <b>both</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> excessive female <b>child</b> mortality, indicating that other direct benefits of education (beyond information an...|$|R

5|$|Starting in 1999, a live {{production}} of Blue's Clues toured the U.S. to positive reviews. Johnson compared the show's audience participation {{with that of}} The Rocky Horror Picture Show. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances. The creators of the TV show were involved {{in all aspects of}} the live show, aiming to translate the bond between the TV show's audience and its cast to the stage and to provide young audiences with their first theatrical experience. The creators chose Jonathan Hochwald as the live show's producer, Gip Hoppe as its director, and Dave Gallo as its set designer. Neither Hoppe nor Gallo had any previous experience in children's theater. Nick Balaban and Michael Rubin, who wrote the music for the TV show, composed the live show's soundtrack. The producers were concerned with children's response to the host, who was played by Tom Mizer (a different actor than the host of the TV show), but his young audience enthusiastically accepted and embraced him. Actors were encouraged to improvise and respond to the audience, which resulted in changes throughout the show's run. The show's script included humor that <b>both</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> their parents could enjoy.|$|E

40|$|Based on data {{collected}} from a representative national sample, India Human Development Survey 2005, this paper investigates the links between obesity among <b>children</b> <b>and</b> among adults {{with a number of}} socio economic characteristics as well as household and location specific variables. <b>Both</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adult obesity are far from negligible, which is a matter of concern, given the links between obesity and some diseases. There are strong links between socio-economic indicators and risk of obesity. In particular, affluence has a robust link to obesity. Among children, taller children in more affluent households are more prone to obesity. Some demographic characteristics matter too, for example, <b>both</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adult obesity rise with age but at a diminishing rate. Location also influences chances of obesity. Relative food price effects matter too through calorie, protein, fat and other nutrient intakes.

Regarding the relationship with child academic adaptation, the both self- and childserving biased attribution has positive influence on adaptation. On the other hand, other-enhancement attributions made by <b>both</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> parent are related to social adaptation. These results suggest that considering parental attributions is important for understanding the relationship between children's attributi on and their school adaptation...|$|R
