60|$|As {{the shell}} burst, the King's aero seemed {{once more to}} spring from the {{platform}} out into mid-air, dipped as before, and glided out over the <b>Blue</b> <b>Mouth</b> with a rapidity which, to look at, took one's breath away.|$|R
50|$|Condorun: Appears in episode 22. Powers include flight, ultra sharp talons with launchable feet, <b>blue</b> <b>mouth</b> flames, launchable back knife, {{blue energy}} bolts from the antennae, rapid fire {{missiles}} in {{each side of}} its torso, projectile resistance, and regeneration for its feet.|$|R
50|$|The fish is maroon, {{with blue}} spot that fades to bright red. The color pattern helps it {{blend in with}} its natural environment. It grows to up to 24 in (60 cm) long. Most adult have <b>blue</b> <b>mouths,</b> while the young have bright red eyes.|$|R
50|$|The Wellington {{green gecko}} {{is much larger}} and more heavily built than the Auckland green gecko and can be {{distinguished}} by the yellow soles on its feet instead of grey-green. It lives arboreally in scrub and forest areas, especially kanuka and manuka. Although it hunts nocturnally, for moths and flies, it also likes to sun-bask. It displays an aggressive behaviour, baring its open <b>blue</b> <b>mouth</b> and barking if provoked.|$|R
6000|$|At last Lloyd remarked, a <b>blue</b> <b>mouth</b> {{speaking}} from a corpse- coloured face, 'You {{seem to be}} the only one with any courage left?' [...] And, do you know, with that word my courage disappeared, and I made the rest of the stage in the same dumb wretchedness as the others. [...] My only terror was lest Fanny should ask for brandy, or laudanum, or something. So awful was the idea of putting my hands out, that I half thought I would refuse.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is worth}} fortifying--and fortifying well, for as a port it is {{peerless}} in Mediterranean seas. The navies {{of the world}} might ride in it, land-locked, and even hidden from view seawards. The mountains which enclose it are in themselves absolute protection. In addition, these can only be assailed from our own territory. Of course, Voivode, you understand when I say 'our' I mean the Land of the Blue Mountains, for whose safety and well-being I am alone concerned. Any ship anchoring in the roads of the <b>Blue</b> <b>Mouth</b> would have only one need--sufficient length of cable for its magnificent depth.|$|R

40|$|A Spiny-tailed gecko, Strophurus krisalys sp. nov., is {{described}} from inland areas of Queensland and coastal and near coastal {{areas in the}} Gulf of Carpentaria. It has <b>blue</b> <b>mouth</b> colour, enlarged spines above the eye, and parallel rows of enlarged, and uniformly coloured tail spines. In these characteristics it is most similar in morphology to Strophurus wellingtonae from inland areas of southern Western Australia, but genetically most similar to the eastern Australian Strophurus williamsi. In the north and southeast margins of its range Strophurus krisalys is parapatric in distribution with two morphologically different populations of Strophurus ciliaris. The new species is arboreal so clearing of native woody vegetation is {{likely to result in}} loss and overall fragmentation of populations...|$|R
60|$|Again {{the faces}} looked west. The Western Squadron was drawing {{near to the}} {{entrance}} of the <b>Blue</b> <b>Mouth.</b> On the bridge of the yacht stood the Western King in uniform of an Admiral, and by him his Queen in a dress of royal purple, splendid with gold. Another glance at the mountain-top showed that it had seemed to become alive. A whole park of artillery seemed to have suddenly sprung to life, round each its crew ready for action. Amongst the group {{at the foot of the}} Flagstaff we could distinguish King Rupert; his vast height and bulk stood out from and above all round him. Close to him was a patch of white, which we understood to be Queen Teuta, whom the Blue Mountaineers simply adore.|$|R

6000|$|The {{public works}} which we began {{immediately}} after the Coronation are going strong. We began {{at the very beginning}} on an elaborate system. The first thing was to adequately fortify the <b>Blue</b> <b>Mouth.</b> Whilst the fortifications were being constructed we kept all the warships in the gulf. But when the point of safety was reached, we made the ships do sentry-go along the coast, whilst we trained men for service at sea. It is our plan to take by degrees all the young men and teach them this wise, so that at the end the whole population shall be trained for sea as well as for land. And as we are teaching them the airship service, too, they will be at home in all the elements--except fire, of course, though if that should become a necessity, we shall tackle it too! ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Ferrars, {{without being}} a regular beauty, had a voluptuous face and form. Her {{complexion}} was brilliant, with large and long-lashed eyes of <b>blue.</b> Her <b>mouth</b> was certainly too large, but the pouting richness {{of her lips}} and the splendour of her teeth baffled criticism. She {{was a woman who}} was always gorgeously or fantastically attired.|$|R
60|$|The King seemed moved. Accustomed {{as he was}} to {{the ritual}} of great occasions, the warmth and sincerity, {{together}} with the gracious humility of this old Eastern custom, touched him, monarch though he was of a great land and many races in the Far East. Impulsively he broke through Court ritual, and did a thing which, I have since been told, won for him for ever a holy place in the warm hearts of the Blue Mountaineers. Sinking on his knee before the beautiful shroud-clad Queen, he raised her hand and kissed it. The act was seen by all {{in and around the}} <b>Blue</b> <b>Mouth,</b> and a mighty cheering rose, which seemed to rise and swell as it ran far and wide up the hillsides, till it faded away on the far-off mountain-top, where rose majestically the mighty Flagstaff bearing the standard of the Balkan Federation.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the early}} morning, whilst the {{mountains}} were still rather grey than blue, the cable-line {{took us to}} the <b>Blue</b> <b>Mouth,</b> where we embarked in the King's yacht, The Lady, which took us across the Adriatic at a pace which I had hitherto considered impossible. The King and Queen came to the landing to see us off. They stood together at the right-hand side of the red-carpeted gangway, and shook hands with each guest as he went on board. The instant the last passenger had stepped on deck the gangway was withdrawn. The Lord High Admiral, who stood on the bridge, raised his hand, and we swept towards the mouth of the gulf. Of course, all hats were off, and we cheered frantically. I can truly say that if King Rupert and Queen Teuta should ever wish to found in the Blue Mountains a colony of diplomatists and journalists, those who were their guests on this great occasion will volunteer to a man. I think old Hempetch, who is the doyen of English-speaking journalists, voiced our sentiments when he said: ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} moment the figures of Rupert and Teuta sank; they were taking their places on the aeroplane. An instant after, like a great golden bird, it seemed to shoot out into the air, and then, dipping its head, dropped {{downward}} at an obtuse angle. We could see the King and Queen from time waist upwards--the King in Blue Mountain dress of green; the Queen, wrapped in her white Shroud, holding her baby on her breast. When far out from the mountain-top and over the <b>Blue</b> <b>Mouth,</b> the wings and tail of the great bird-like machine went up, and the aero dropped like a stone, till it was only some few hundred feet over the water. Then the wings and tail went down, but with diminishing speed. Below the expanse of the plane the King and Queen were now seen seated together on the tiny steering platform, which {{seemed to have been}} lowered; she sat behind her husband, after the manner of matrons of the Blue Mountains. That coming of that aeroplane was the most striking episode of all this wonderful day.|$|R
6000|$|What the {{movement}} {{going on is}} I cannot guess. It is not like the uneasiness that went before the abduction of Teuta and the Voivode, but {{it is even more}} pronounced. That was an uneasiness founded on some suspicion. This is a positive thing, and has definite meaning--of some sort. We shall, I suppose, know all about it in good time. In the meantime we go on with our work. Happily the whole <b>Blue</b> <b>Mouth</b> and the mountains round it are on my own property, the portion acquired long ago by Uncle Roger, exclusive of the Vissarion estate. I asked the Voivode to allow me to transfer it to him, but he sternly refused and forbade me, quite peremptorily, to ever open the subject to him again. [...] "You have done enough already," [...] he said. [...] "Were I to allow you to go further, I should feel mean. And I do not think you would like your wife's father to suffer that feeling after a long life, which he has tried to live in honour." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{there is}} a way. I can see it. Whilst our dear Voivodin was speaking, the way seemed to clear. I saw {{at the back of}} the <b>Blue</b> <b>Mouth,</b> where it goes deepest into the heart of the cliffs, the opening of a great tunnel, which ran upward over a steep slope till it debouched on the first plateau beyond the range of the {{encompassing}} cliffs. Thither came by various rails of steep gradient, by timber-shoots and cable-rails, by aerial cables and precipitating tubes, wealth from over ground and under it; for as our Land is all mountains, and as these tower up to the clouds, transport to the sea shall be easy and of little cost when once the machinery is established. As everything of much weight goes downward, the cars of the main tunnel of the port shall return upward without cost. We can have from the mountains a head of water under good control, which will allow of endless hydraulic power, so that the whole port and the mechanism of the town to which it will grow can be worked by it.|$|R
500|$|Bates goes {{hunting with}} a native, who brings down a crested oropendola with a {{blowpipe}} {{at a range}} of 30 yards (27 metres); {{he notes that the}} usefully silent weapon can kill at twice that range, but that he and Wallace [...] "found it very difficult to hold steady the long tubes". Around a campfire, he listens to tales; the Bouto or river dolphin used to take [...] "the shape of a beautiful woman, with hair hanging loose to her heels, and walking ashore at night in the streets of Ega, to entice the young men down to the water" [...] where the Bouto would grab them and [...] "plunge beneath the waves with a triumphant cry". They go turtle-hunting; and Bates kills an alligator with a heavy stick. He finds many footprints of the jaguar, and [...] "the great pleasure" [...] of seeing the [...] "rare and curious umbrella bird". Arrived in Catua, he admires a woman of 17: [...] "her figure was almost faultless", and her <b>blue</b> <b>mouth</b> [...] "gave quite a captivating finish to her appearance", but she was [...] "extremely bashful". He is amazed at how much alcohol the [...] "shy Indian and Mameluco maidens" [...] can drink, never giving way to their suitors without it.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, {{the blood}} parrots were further {{crossbred}} with the Human Face Red God of Fortune, which produced {{a new breed}} called the Five-Colors God of Fortune. With its beautiful colors, this fish quickly became popular. Selective breeding continued through 1998, when the Seven-Colors <b>Blue</b> Fiery <b>Mouth</b> (also known as Greenish Gold Tiger) was imported from Central America, and crossbred with the Jin Gang Blood Parrot from Taiwan. This crossbreeding led to {{the first generation of}} Hua Luo Han flowerhorn hybrids, which were then followed by subsequent flowerhorn introductions.|$|R

But he would have her walk with him more than she was able. She had a bad fainting bout. So grey her face was, so <b>blue</b> her <b>mouth!</b> It was agony to him. He felt as if someone were pushing a knife in his chest. Then she was better again, and he forgot. But the anxiety remained inside him, like a wound that did not close.|$|R

60|$|We {{embarked}} {{again on}} the warships--one a huge, steel-plated Dreadnought, up to date in every particular, the other an armoured yacht most complete in every way, and of unique speed. The King and Queen, the Lords of the Council, together with the various high ecclesiastics and great officials, went on the yacht, which the Lord High Admiral, a man of remarkably masterful physiognomy, himself steered. The rest of those present at the Coronation came on the warship. The latter went fast, but the yacht showed her heels all the way. However, the King's party waited in the dock in the <b>Blue</b> <b>Mouth.</b> From this a new cable-line took us all to the State House at Plazac. Here the procession was reformed, and wound {{its way to a}} bare hill in the immediate vicinity. The King and Queen--the King still wearing the ancient bronze crown with which the Archbishop had invested him at St. Sava's--the Archbishop, the Vladika, and the four Archimandrites stood together {{at the top of the}} hill, the King and Queen being, of course, in the front. A courteous young gentleman, to whom I had been accredited at the beginning of the day--all guests were so attended--explained to me that, as this was the national as opposed to the religious ceremony, the Vladika, who is the official representative of the laity, took command here. The ecclesiastics were put prominently forward, simply out of courtesy, in obedience to the wish of the people, by whom they were all greatly beloved.|$|R
60|$|The Russian came on. They {{could see}} his eyes, like two <b>blue</b> stones. His <b>mouth</b> was open a little. He needed a shave; his chin was stubbled.

5000|$|The Le Sueur River {{rises in}} Hartland Township in northwestern Freeborn County and flows {{initially}} northwardly, through the southwestern extremity of Steele County into Waseca County, then westwardly in a winding course into Blue Earth County, passing through St. Clair.

60|$|To me {{it seems}} not only advisable, but necessary, that the utmost {{discretion}} be observed by all our little group, at all events for the present. There {{seems to be}} some new uneasiness in the Blue Mountains. There are constant meetings of members of the Council, but no formal meeting of the Council, as such, since the last one at which I was present. There is constant coming and going amongst the mountaineers, always in groups, small or large. Teuta and I, who have been about very much on the aeroplane, have both noticed it. But somehow we--that is, the Voivode and myself--are left out of everything; but we have not said as yet a word on the subject to any of the others. The Voivode notices, but he says nothing; so I am silent, and Teuta does whatever I ask. Sir Colin does not notice anything except the work he is engaged on--the planning the defences of the <b>Blue</b> <b>Mouth.</b> His old scientific training as an engineer, and his enormous experience of wars and sieges--for he was for nearly fifty years sent as military representative to all the great wars--seem to have become directed on that point. He is certainly planning it all out in a wonderful way. He consults Rooke almost hourly on the maritime side of the question. The Lord High Admiral has been a watcher all his life, and very few important points have ever escaped him, so that he can add greatly to the wisdom of the defensive construction. He notices, I think, that something is going on outside ourselves; but he keeps a resolute silence.|$|R
50|$|After {{wandering}} {{the streets for}} a while, the Doctor decides that the disappearance {{has something to do}} with that night's events, and they go back to Sir George's. A car pulls up as they arrive, and a woman with red hair comes in wearing shimmering silk and a mask in the shape of a butterfly. Only her <b>blue</b> eyes and <b>mouth</b> are visible. Her name is given as Melissa Heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "May I say a word? I am emboldened to, as Sir Colin {{has spoken}} so splendidly, {{and as the}} Lord High Admiral has not hesitated to mention his dreaming. I, too, have had a dream--a day-dream--which came in a flash, but no less a dream, for all that. It was when we hung on the {{aeroplane}} over the <b>Blue</b> <b>Mouth.</b> It seemed to me in an instant that I saw that beautiful spot as it will some time be--typical, as Sir Colin said, of the wealth {{as well as the}} strength of this nation; a mart for the world whence will come for barter some of the great wealth of the Blue Mountains. That wealth is as yet undeveloped. But the day is at hand when we may begin to use it, and through that very port. Our mountains and their valleys are clad with trees of splendid growth, virgin forests of priceless worth; hard woods of all kinds, which have no superior throughout the world. In the rocks, though hidden as yet, is vast mineral wealth of many kinds. I have been looking through the reports of the geological exports of the Commission of Investigation which my husband organized soon after he came to live here, and, according to them, our whole mountain ranges simply teem with vast quantities of minerals, almost more precious for industry than gold and silver are for commerce--though, indeed, gold is not altogether lacking as a mineral. When once our work on the harbour is done, and the place has been made secure against any attempt at foreign aggression, we must {{try to find a way}} to bring this wealth of woods and ores down to the sea.|$|R
