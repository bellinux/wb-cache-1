25|$|Kinetic isotope {{effects are}} common in {{biological}} systems and are especially important for hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry. Kinetic effects usually result in larger fractionations than equilibrium reactions. In any isotope system, kinetic effects are stronger for larger mass differences. Light isotopes in most systems also tend to move faster but form weaker bonds. At high temperatures, entropy explains a large signal in isotope composition. However, when temperature decreases isotope effects are more expressed and randomness plays less of a role. These general trends are exposed in further understanding of <b>bond</b> <b>breaking,</b> diffusion or effusion, and condensation or evaporation reactions.|$|E
500|$|With {{the script}} {{following}} the novel {{more closely than}} the other film adaptations of the eponymous source novels, there are several continuity errors due to the film taking place in a different order, such as Blofeld not recognising Bond, despite having met him face-to-face in the previous film You Only Live Twice. In the original script, Bond undergoes plastic surgery to disguise him from his enemies; the intention was to allow an unrecognisable Bond to infiltrate Blofeld's hideout and help the audience accept the new actor in the role. However, this was dropped in favour of ignoring the change in actor. To make audiences not forget {{it was the same}} James Bond, just played by another actor, the producers inserted many references to the previous films, some as in-jokes. These include <b>Bond</b> <b>breaking</b> the fourth wall by stating [...] "This never happened to the other fellow", the credits sequence with images from the previous instalments, Bond visiting his office and finding objects from Dr. No, From Russia with Love and Thunderball, and a caretaker whistling the theme from Goldfinger.|$|E
50|$|Damage is {{incorporated}} in the pairwise force function by allowing <b>bonds</b> to <b>break</b> when their elongation exceeds some prescribed value. After a <b>bond</b> <b>breaks,</b> it no longer sustains any force, and the endpoints are effectively disconnected from each other. When a <b>bond</b> <b>breaks,</b> the force it was carrying is redistributed to other bonds {{that have not yet}} broken. This increased load makes it more likely that these other <b>bonds</b> will <b>break.</b> The process of bond breakage and load redistribution, leading to further breakage, is how cracks grow in the peridynamic model.|$|R

This conclusion by Bunnett is a contradiction from the Hammond postulate. The Hammond postulate is the opposite of what Bunnett theorized. In the transition state of a <b>bond</b> <b>breaking</b> step it involves little breaking when the bond is easily broken and much breaking when it is difficult to break.

2500|$|Another {{method was}} {{developed}} by Robert Fleischer, P.Buford Price, and RobertM. Walker for use in high-altitude balloons. In this method, sheets of clear plastic, like 0.25mm Lexan polycarbonate, are stacked together and exposed directly to cosmic rays in space or high altitude. The nuclear charge causes chemical <b>bond</b> <b>breaking</b> or ionization in the plastic. At {{the top of the}} plastic stack the ionization is less, due to the high cosmic ray speed. As the cosmic ray speed decreases due to deceleration in the stack, the ionization increases along the path. The resulting plastic sheets are [...] "etched" [...] or slowly dissolved in warm caustic sodium hydroxide solution, that removes the surface material at a slow, known rate. The caustic sodium hydroxide dissolves the plastic at a faster rate along the path of the ionized plastic. The net result is a conical etch pit in the plastic. The etch pits are measured under a high-power microscope (typically 1600× oil-immersion), and the etch rate is plotted {{as a function of the}} depth in the stacked plastic.|$|E

50|$|The {{choice of}} the {{exponential}} ansatz is opportune because (unlike other ansatzes, for example, configuration interaction) it guarantees the size extensivity of the solution.

If one were to use, for example, the CCSD, CCSDT, or CCSD(T) levels of theory, they would not provide reasonable results for the <b>bond</b> <b>breaking</b> of F, with the latter two approaches providing unphysical potential energy surfaces, though this is for reasons other than just size consistency.|$|E
