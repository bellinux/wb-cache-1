In Malaysia, {{the right to}} vote is entrenched in Article 119 of the Federal Constitution, but suffrage is similarly denied to those serving prison terms. In Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia (2009), it was held that while detainees under the Internal Security Act 1960– who have not been convicted of any crime– still enjoy {{the right to vote}} in national elections, that right may only be exercised only in the constituencies they are registered in, and does not extend to allowing them to vote while incarcerated elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The current {{economic}} climate {{in the country}} has affected many Icelandic businesses and citizens. With the creation of Nýi Landsbanki, the new organisation which replaces the old Landsbanki, around 300 employees will lose their jobs due to a radical restructuring of the organisation which is intended to minimise the bank's international operations. Similar job losses are expected at Glitnir and Kaupthing The job losses can <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 2,136 registered unemployed and 495 advertised vacancies in Iceland {{at the end of}} August 2008.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{domestic animal}} {{could also be}} regarded as a zduhać, such as a shepherd dog, ox, bellwether, horse, or billy goat. If an animal habitually made vocal sounds in sleep, it was assumed to be a zduhać. Such an animal was cherished, and was not for sale. The spirit of the animal zduhać would leave its body in sleep and fight against the enemy zduhaći, to protect its own flock or herd. Only the fertility of the livestock depended on the outcome of the battles fought by the animal zduhaći; they had no bearing on the crop yield. In the region of Užice, western Serbia, it was believed that storms and hail clouds were led by zduhaći who flew above them in the form of big birds. A black ox and a three-year-old rooster defended their village from them—especially the rooster, for which reason he was not killed for food, but kept as a home guardian. In folk spells for repelling hail clouds in Serbia, these clouds were called white cattle. This could <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea of the black ox as a defender from hail.|$|E

5|$|The Galileo craft made six close flybys of Ganymede from 1995–2000 (G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29) and {{discovered}} that Ganymede has a permanent (intrinsic) magnetic moment independent of the Jovian magnetic field. The value of the moment is about , which is three {{times larger than the}} magnetic moment of Mercury. The magnetic dipole is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176°, which means that it is directed against the Jovian magnetic moment. Its north pole lies below the orbital plane. The dipole magnetic field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 ± 2 nT at Ganymede's equator, which should <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Jovian magnetic field at the distance of Ganymede—about 120 nT. The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field, meaning reconnection is possible. The intrinsic field strength at the poles is two times that at the equator—1440 nT.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the council can only <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> quite unique and unusual {{composition of}} the German upper house, the Bundesrat. Membership of the Bundesrat is limited {{to members of the}} governments of the states of Germany and can be recalled by those governments {{in the same manner as}} the EU's Council. They retain their state role while sitting in the Bundesrat and if their term ends when they are recalled by their state governments (who are solely responsible for their appointment) or they cease to sit in their state government. Hence they also are not elected at the same time and the body as a whole cannot be dissolved like most parliaments. As government representatives, members do not vote as individual members but in state blocks, rather than political alignment, to their state governments' agreed line. Each state has unequal voting powers based on population, with an absolute majority required for decisions. Likewise, the presidency rotates equally between members, though each year rather than every six months like in the EU Council. However, unlike the EU's Council, the Bundesrat does not vary its composition depending on the topic being discussed. They both bear similar criticisms, because of the interference, of executives in the legislative process.|$|E

25|$|A related {{issue is}} the methane {{clathrate}} reservoirs found under sediments on the ocean floors. These trap large amounts of the greenhouse gas methane, which ocean warming {{has the potential to}} release. In 2004 the global inventory of ocean methane clathrates was estimated to occupy between one and five million cubic kilometres. If all these clathrates were to be spread uniformly across the ocean floor, this would translate to a thickness between three and fourteen metres. This estimate corresponds to 500–2500 gigatonnes carbon (GtC), and can <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 5000 GtC estimated for all other fossil fuel reserves.|$|E
