40|$|Networks (WSNs) and the {{mechanisms}} {{to support the}} requirements, demand a critical examination. Therefore, the security protocols employed in WSNs should be so designed, as to yield the optimum performance. The efficiency of the block cipher is, {{one of the important}} factors in leveraging the performance of any security protocol. In this paper, therefore, we focus on the issue of optimizing the security vs. performance tradeoff in the security protocols in WSNs. As part of the exercise, we evaluate the storage requirements of the block ciphers viz. the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher Rijndael, the Corrected <b>Block</b> Tiny <b>Encryption</b> Algorithm (XXTEA) using the Output Codebook Block (OCB) mode. We compare our results with the Skipjack cipher in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. Our results clearly show the light-weight cipher XXTEA, as the optimal cipher and the Output Codebook Mode as the optimal mode of operation for the link layer security protocols. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first experimental evaluation of the AES cipher Rijndael, the corrected <b>block</b> Tiny <b>Encryption</b> Algorithm (XXTEA) and the OCB mode in the link layer security architecture for WSNs.

50|$|A naive {{approach}} to increase {{strength of a}} <b>block</b> <b>encryption</b> algorithm with short key length (like DES) would be to use two keys (K1, K2) instead of one, and encrypt each block twice: EK2(EK1(plaintext)). If the original key length is n bits, one would hope this scheme provides security equivalent to using key 2n bits long. Unfortunately, this approach is vulnerable to meet-in-the-middle attack: given a known plaintext pair (x, y), such that y = EK2(EK1(x)), one can recover the key pair (K1, K2) in ~2n steps, instead of ~22n steps one would expect from algorithm with 2n bits of key.|$|E

50|$|To hide {{patterns}} in encrypted data while avoiding the re-issuing {{of a new}} key after each block cipher invocation, a method is needed to randomize the input data. In 1980, the NIST published a national standard document designated Federal Information Processing Standard(FIPS) PUB 81, which specified four so-called block cipher modes of operation, each describing a different solution for encrypting a set of input blocks. The first mode implements the simple strategy described above, and was specified as the electronic codebook (ECB) mode. In contrast, {{each of the other}} modes describe a process where ciphertext from one <b>block</b> <b>encryption</b> step gets intermixed with the data from the next encryption step. To initiate this process, an additional input value is required to be mixed with the first block, and which is referred to as an initialization vector. For example, the cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode requires a random value of the cipher's block size as additional input, and adds it to the first plaintext block before subsequent encryption. In turn, the ciphertext produced in the first encryption step is added to the second plaintext block, and so on. The ultimate goal for encryption schemes is to provide semantic security: by this property, it is practically impossible for an attacker to draw any knowledge from observed ciphertext. It can be shown that each of the three additional modes specified by the NIST are semantically secure under so-called chosen-plaintext attacks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The meet-in-the-middle (MITM) {{attack on}} AES {{is a great}} success. In this paper, we apply the method to the {{lightweight}} SPN block cipher mCrypton. We prove that the multiset technique used to analyze AES can not be applied directly to mCrypton due to the scarcity of information. As a solution, we replace the unordered multiset with the ordered sequence. We lower the memory requirement from 2100 to 244 using the efficient differential enumeration technique. Based on these modifications, we construct a MITM attack on 7 -round mCrypton- 64 / 96 / 128 with complexities of 244 64 -bit <b>blocks</b> and 257 <b>encryptions.</b> We further extend the attack to 8 and 9 rounds for mCrypton- 128 by adding some key-bridging tech-niques.

40|$|The {{weak point}} of the {{existing}} <b>block</b> <b>encryption</b> scheme is that the plain text or encryption key could be easily exposed differential cryptanalysis or linear cryptanalysis, which is mostly used for decoding <b>block</b> <b>encryption.</b> This is because the encryption schemes have been designed for the fixed size encryption key. Another weak {{point of the}} existing <b>block</b> <b>encryption</b> algorithm {{is that it has}} a fixed permutation table and fixed number of encryption rounds. In order to overcome these weaknesses, an encryption algorithm using unlimited size of key and dynamically changing permutation table should be designed. A new encryption technique called Variable size <b>Block</b> <b>Encryption</b> using Dynamic-key Mechanism (VBEDM), which is designed with unlimited key size, dynamically changing permutation table based on the encryption key and variable block size for each round. To make the cryptanalyst hard to expose the plain text, from the array of compression algorithms the VBEDM uses a compression technique based on key. The compression used is not for compressing the text but for strengthening the encryption method. Because of its dynamic functionality in input block size, key size, permutation, number of rounds and compression it makes the crypt analyst too hard to analyzing the cipher text. This algorithm also uses a compression technique from an array of compression algorithm resulting in more confusion to the analyst...|$|E

To {{estimate}} a {{block cipher}} {{resistance to the}} differential cryptanalysis and its various modifications, as a rule, {{it is necessary to}} obtain the upper bounds of the round differential average probability. Round functions of most of the modern <b>block</b> <b>encryption</b> algorithms (e. g. AES, GOST 28147, "Kalina") contain the composition of the key adder, substitution blocks, and the operator, which is linear over F? or some its extension. Therefore, the problem of obtaining upper bounds for block ciphers resistance is reduced to the problem of constructing upper bounds for the average probability of such compositions, or consists it as a subtask. In this work, the upper bounds are obtained for the integer differentials average probability of maps which are compositions of the key adder, substitution blocks, and the linear (over some ring) operator. The parameters of s-blocks, on which these bounds are depended, are defined and conditions, to ensure the least possible values of these parameters, are given.

For these two methods we introduce an example for Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm.

We demonstrate that straightforward implementations of AES candidates on smart cards, are highly vulnerable to power analysis and readily leak away all secret keys. To illustrate our point, we describe a power based attack on the Twofish Reference 6805 code which we implemented on a ST 16 smart card.

30|$|Encryption: This module {{provides}} the document and index encryption functionality. Figure  3 shows {{the framework for}} the implementation of the SSE- 2 Encryption module. First, the key generator is initiated to generate keys. Since symmetric key generation does not require much computational power, we assume that the key generator is located at the user device. This resolves the key distribution issue. The key generation is a one-time process to generate and store the keys. After the key generation, a user inputs a set of document for the encryption and index creation. When user inputs the document set, the Encryption module uses the Keyword Extractor block to pull out the keyword and builds an index of all the words in the document. After keyword extraction, input documents and the document index are fetched to the <b>Encryption</b> <b>block.</b> The <b>Encryption</b> <b>block</b> uses the keys generated by the key generator to create the encrypted document set and encrypted document index.
