The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to <b>binary</b> search, taking on average logarithmic time.

40|$|The {{stability}} of mass transfer {{is important in}} the formation of contact <b>binaries</b> from detached <b>binaries</b> when the primaries of the initially detached <b>binaries</b> fill their Roche lobes. Using Eggleton's stellar evolution code, we investigate the formation and the short-period limit of contact <b>binaries</b> by considering the effect of the in{{stability of}} mass transfer. It is found that with decreasing initial primary mass from 0. 89 M_ to 0. 63 M_, the range of the initial mass ratio decreases for detached <b>binaries</b> that experience stable mass transfer and evolve into contact. If the initial primary mass is less than 0. 63 M_, detached <b>binaries</b> would experience dynamically unstable mass transfer when the primaries of detached <b>binaries</b> fill their Roche lobes. These systems would evolve into a common envelope situation and probably then to a complete merger of two components on a quite short timescale. This results in a low mass limit at about 0. 63 M_ for the primary mass of contact <b>binaries,</b> which might be a main reason why the period distribution of contact <b>binaries</b> has a short limit of about 0. 22 days. By comparing the theoretical period distribution of contact <b>binaries</b> with the observational data, it is found that the observed contact <b>binaries</b> are above the low mass limit for the primary mass of contact <b>binaries</b> and no observed contact <b>binaries</b> are below this limit. This suggests that the short-period limit of contact <b>binaries</b> {{can be explained by the}} instability of the mass transfer that occurs when the primaries of the initially detached <b>binaries</b> fill their Roche lobes.

The uniform <b>binary</b> search was presented to Donald Knuth in 1971 by A. K. Chandra of Stanford University and published in Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming.

5|$|In {{computer}} science, <b>binary</b> search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or <b>binary</b> chop, is a search algorithm that finds {{the position of a}} target value within a sorted array. <b>Binary</b> search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful.

40|$|We {{report an}} {{analysis}} of twins of spectral types F or later in the 9 th Catalog of Spectroscopic <b>Binaries</b> (SB 9). Twins, the components of <b>binaries</b> with mass ratio within 2 % of 1. 0, are found among the <b>binaries</b> with primaries of F and G spectral type. They are most prominent among the <b>binaries</b> with periods less than 43 days, a cutoff first identified by Lucy. Within the subsample of <b>binaries</b> with P< 43 days, the twins do not differ from the other <b>binaries</b> in their distributions of periods (median P ∼ 7 d), masses, or orbital eccentricities. Combining the mass ratio distribution in the SB 9 in the mass range 0. 6 to 0. 85 M ⊙ with that measured by Mazeh et al. for <b>binaries</b> in the Carney-Latham high proper motion survey, we estimate that the frequency of twins in a large sample of spectroscopic <b>binaries</b> is about 3 %. Current theoretical understanding indicates that accretion of high specific angular momentum material by a protobinary tends to equalize its masses. We speculate that the excess of twins is produced in those star forming regions where the accretion processes were able to proceed to completion for a minority of protobinaries. This predicts that the components of a young twin may appear to differ in age and that, {{in a sample of}} spectroscopic <b>binaries</b> in a star formation region, the twins are, on average, older than the <b>binaries</b> with mass ratios much smaller than 1...|$|R

40|$|Recently, our {{understanding}} of the origin of W UMa-type contact <b>binaries</b> has become clearer. Initial masses of their components were successfully estimated by Yıldız and Doğan using a new method mainly based on observational properties of overluminous secondary components. In this paper, we continue to discuss the results and make computations for age and orbital evolution of these <b>binaries.</b> It is shown that the secondary mass, according to its luminosity, also successfully predicts the observed radius. While the current mass of the primary component is determined by initial masses, the current secondary mass is also a function of initial angular momentum. We develop methods to compute the age of A- and W-subtype W UMa-type contact <b>binaries</b> in terms of initial masses and mass according to the luminosity of the secondaries. Comparisons of our results with the mean ages from kinematic properties of these <b>binaries</b> and data pertaining to contact <b>binaries</b> in open and globular clusters, have increased our confidence on this method. The mean ages of both A- and W-subtype contact <b>binaries</b> are found as 4. 4 and 4. 6 Gyr, respectively. From kinematic studies, these ages are given as 4. 5 and 4. 4 Gyr, respectively.
