25|$|As I left {{extremism}} I realised {{that if you}} {{are born}} here and grow up here, then you <b>belong</b> <b>here.</b> The Islam that was preached 2,000 years ago isn’t going to work here in modern London. Muslims need to alter their lifestyles to a Western lifestyle. To criticise is not Islamaphobic. It's about opposing certain ideas.|$|E
25|$|Tetrapulmonata, here {{consisting}} of Araneae, Amblypygi and Thelyphonida (Schizomida {{was not included}} in the study), received strong support. The addition of Scorpiones to produce a clade called Arachnopulmonata was also well supported. Pseudoscorpiones may also <b>belong</b> <b>here,</b> possibly as the sister of Scorpiones. Somewhat unexpectedly, there was support for a clade comprising Opiliones, Ricinulei and Solifugae, a combination not found in most other studies.|$|E

25|$|One {{containing}} American species {{which are}} mainly black-footed, black-plumaged, and have yellow skin {{at the base}} of the bill as well as white display crests behind the eyes in breeding plumage. They occur in marine and freshwater habitats. The flightless cormorant of the Galápagos Islands also seems to <b>belong</b> <b>here.</b> Its wings have been reduced by evolution to a tiny size, it is extremely apomorphic due to its flightlessness, and its plumage is entirely nondescript. If considered a distinct genus, they would get the name Dilophalieus or (more probably) Nannopterum, the old genus of the flightless cormorant.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Lillian Pimlott {{wrote to}} her mother, after being {{deployed}} to Pearl Harbor, and said, [...] "I {{was fascinated by the}} ships which are making history in every battle. I've talked to seamen and I've met flyers-from Iwo (Iwo Jima), from Okinawa, heroes from every encounter. I know now what war means and {{my heart goes out to}} every one of them. Among them I am making, I hope, life long friends, for their experiences mean everything to my self-satisfaction... As long as they fight on, I have no desire to return home, for I feel I <b>belong</b> <b>here...</b> I have learned much in these brief three months about life and living. And I know I have already changed in many ways and many viewpoints... It is truly a most broadening experience and I shall never outlive it".|$|E

Notably, the State Language Center holds contests for language mistakes, named [...] "Gimalajiešu superlācis" [...] after an infamous incorrect translation of Asiatic Black Bear. These mistakes, often quite amusing, are both grammatical and stylistic; sometimes also obvious typos and mistranslations {{are considered to}} <b>belong</b> <b>here.</b> Organizers claim that mistakes are largely collected in areas heavily populated by Russian-speakers, {{as well as from}} Lithuanian-owned chain stores. Mistranslations are not necessarily grammatical, but also stylistic and vocabulary mistakes, such as literal translations from the English language.|$|E

My parents were born in Ukraine: I'm Ukrainian. I'm not Russian. So, excuse me, but I don't <b>belong</b> <b>here.</b> It's best if we leave."

In 1904, the same magazine commissioned him to illustrate a Western story, and Pyle urged Wyeth to go West to acquire direct knowledge, much as Zane Grey had done for his Western novels. In Colorado, he worked as a cowboy alongside the professional [...] "punchers", moving cattle and doing ranch chores. He visited the Navajo in Arizona and gained an understanding of Native American culture. When his money was stolen, he worked as a mail carrier, riding between the Two Grey Hills trading post and Fort Defiance, to earn enough to get back home. He wrote home, [...] "The life is wonderful, strange—the fascination of it clutches me like some unseen animal—it seems to whisper, 'Come back, you <b>belong</b> <b>here,</b> this is your real home.'" ...|$|E
