5|$|By {{the end of}} the draft, around 40% of {{the players}} {{selected}} in it were born from countries outside the United States. It would remain the highest influx of international players selected in the modern NBA draft era until the 2016 NBA draft, where almost half of the selected players were born in countries outside the US. In addition, four of the players selected in the draft were Russians, which not only marked the highest number of players born in that region to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> one draft, but also was the highest representation of a country in one draft until 2016 when five Frenchmen would <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> the draft.|$|E

According to the 1983 census, the population of the country was 35,442,972 as of 31 March 1983, and the Bamar accounted for 69 percent of the population. The Burmese government estimates the population at 60.98 million in October 2012, based on approximate reproduction rates.|$|R
50|$|The first {{population}} census {{after the}} independence <b>in</b> 1946 <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> 1952.

The following censuses have <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> 1979, 1994 and 2004. The distribution of Palestinians and Jordanians within the population has been a politically sensitive issue since the Six-Day war in 1967.|$|R
5|$|COSSAC {{was charged}} with {{planning}} three operations: Operation Cockade, a deception operation to keep German forces pinned to the coast; Operation Rankin, a plan for measures to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> {{the case of a}} sudden German collapse; and Operation Overlord, a plan for a full-scale assault on north western Europe. Morgan and his staff worked on the Overlord plan throughout June and the first half of July 1943. He presented it to the Chiefs of Staff Committee on 15 July. The plan set forth in detail the conditions under which the assault could be made, the area where a landing would be feasible, and the means by which a lodgement on the continent would be developed.|$|E
5|$|Many day hikes can <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> the park. Back-country camping {{is allowed}} at campsites along the trails. A permit is {{required}} {{and can be}} obtained from certain visitor centers or arranged for in advance. Much of Glacier's back country is usually inaccessible to hikers until early June due to accumulated snow pack and avalanche risk, and many trails at higher altitudes remain snow packed until July. Campgrounds that allow vehicle access are found throughout the park, most of which are near one of the larger lakes. The campgrounds at St. Mary and at Apgar are open year-round, but conditions are primitive in the off-season, as the restroom facilities are closed and there is no running water. All campgrounds with vehicle access are usually open from mid-June until mid-September. Guide and shuttle services are also available.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{very small}} {{fraction}} of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care has to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> order to prevent larger diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles are sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of X-ray fluorescence, after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of X-rays became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.|$|E

5|$|Plant {{technology}} {{began to}} be turned {{to the problem of}} directly chilling rooms and containers, to replace the need to carry ice at all. Pressure began to grow for a replacement for ice bunkers on the trans-Atlantic routes during the 1870s. Tellier produced a chilled storeroom for the steamship Le Frigorifique, using it to ship beef from Argentina to France, while the Glasgow-based firm of Bells helped to sponsor a new, compressed-air chiller for ships using the Gorrie approach, called the Bell-Coleman design. These technologies soon became used on the trade to Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. The same approach began to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> other industries. Carl von Linde found ways of applying mechanical refrigeration to the brewing industry, removing its reliance on natural ice; cold warehouses and meat packers began to rely on chilling plants.|$|E
5|$|The early {{nuclear weapons}} were large, complex and cumbersome. They were stored as {{components}} rather than complete devices and required expert knowledge to assemble. The short {{life of their}} lead-acid batteries and modulated neutron initiators, and the heat generated by the fissile cores, precluded storing them assembled. The large quantity of conventional explosive in each weapon demanded special care <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> handling. Groves hand-picked a team of regular Army officers, who were trained in the assembly and handling of the weapons. They in turn trained the enlisted soldiers, and the Army teams then trained teams from the Navy and Air Force.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{addresses}} hominization from {{an ironic}} point of view. Mankind's evolution from the ape-like Australopithecus afarenses to modern society with history, technology and cultural expression is compressed into only seven days. The strong allusion to faith is contrasted by numerous references to scientific insights. With {{the evolution of}} mankind starting in Central Africa, Lucy is the name given to the first skeleton of an Australopitecus afarensis found. The characters mention that Homo erectus would be the hominid species to tame fire. Orrorin and Toumaï represent two of the oldest-known hominin ancestors, while Aegyptopithecus zeuxis {{is one of the}} earliest primates. Through scientific references and a distinct ironic tone, Ingrid Reichel makes it clear in her review that the book cannot <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> by any religion or fundamentalism.|$|E

5|$|There is {{controversy}} {{concerning the}} safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy. While they are not major teratogens, uncertainty remains {{as to whether they}} cause cleft palate in a small number of babies and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. Benzodiazepines can <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness. However, they are less toxic than their predecessors, the barbiturates, and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. When combined with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as alcoholic drinks and opioids, the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases. Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse.|$|E
5|$|Exposure occurs through inhalation, {{ingestion}} or occasionally skin contact. Lead may <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> {{through direct}} contact with mouth, nose, and eyes (mucous membranes), and through breaks in the skin. Tetraethyllead, which was a gasoline additive and is still used in fuels such as aviation fuel, passes through the skin; however inorganic lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin. The main sources of absorption of inorganic lead are from ingestion and inhalation. In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of {{that goes into the}} bloodstream. Of ingested inorganic lead, about 15% is absorbed, but this percentage is higher in children, pregnant women, and people with deficiencies of calcium, zinc, or iron. Infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but little is known about absorption rates in children.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that Rosaviakosmos had taken out an insurance policy worth 200 million US dollars to cover damage caused by falling debris. The risk of debris from the station reaching land {{was estimated to be}} 3%. Countries located near the target zone monitored events surrounding the deorbit to determine whether precautions should <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b> <b>In</b> New Zealand the Satellite Reentry Committee was responsible for this, whilst Emergency Management Australia handled preparations in Australia. The head of the Japanese Defense Agency, Toshitsugu Saito, postponed a trip to the United States in case any debris fell on Japan, as the station was scheduled to pass over several Japanese islands on its final orbit. Residents of Okinawa were warned to stay indoors as the station passed overhead. Members of the South Pacific Forum requested assurance from Russia {{that they would not be}} hit by falling debris.
