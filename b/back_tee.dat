50|$|Rees Jones, {{the son of}} Robert Trent Jones, began {{helping to}} {{redesign}} some of the holes at Montauk Downs in 2002.

These improvements are being made gradually to avoid interrupting play. Every year Montauk Downs holds a gala event {{at the end of}} the summer to help raise money for the golf course renovations.|$|E

John Daly left his mark, and a plaque is permanently displayed on the <b>back</b> <b>tee</b> deck, recounting Daly's attempt to reach the green with his tee shot. His ball landed in the creek.|$|E
5000|$|Charles Banks {{stated in}} 1925 “This hole has its {{original}} on the Biarritz {{course at the}} famous watering hole in France of the same name… There is a 163 yard carry from the <b>back</b> <b>tee.</b> The green proper is behind a deep trench in the approach. The approach {{is about the same}} size as the green itself and is bunkered heavily on both right and left with water jutting in on the right front. The fairway is the lake… The green is heavily battered at the back and right and the whole psychology of the hole is to let out to the limit… Correct play for this green is to carry to the near edge of the groove or trench and come up on the green with a roll. The disappearance and reappearance of the ball in the groove adds to the interest of the play.” ...|$|E
