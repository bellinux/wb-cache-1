5|$|After graduating with {{a degree}} in sociology, Nash was {{selected}} 15th overall by the Phoenix Suns {{in the first round of}} the 1996 NBA draft. Upon hearing the draft announcement, Suns fans booed in disapproval of the relatively unknown player. This was because despite his impressive college accomplishments, Nash had not played in one of the major college conferences. A major influence in Phoenix's choice was assistant coach Donnie Nelson, who met Nash <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> as he was coached by Nelson's friend Ken Shields, and would eventually befriend the player as he played in Santa Clara. During his first two seasons in the NBA, Nash played a supporting role behind NBA star point guards Kevin Johnson, Sam Cassell, and later, Jason Kidd. Both Johnson and Cassell had NBA Finals experience, while Kidd was the second overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft and already an All-Star when he arrived at Phoenix.|$|E

500|$|Bill Janovitz of Allmusic {{describes}} the music as beautiful, with folk guitar chord changes and a somber melody, while the chorus, with its line [...] "and it's all over now, Baby Blue" [...] has a heartbreaking quality to it. Like other Dylan {{songs of the}} period, such as [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the lyrics of [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] bear the strong influence of Symbolist poets such as Arthur Rimbaud. Lines such as [...] "take what you have gathered from coincidence" [...] reflect the I Ching philosophy that coincidence represents more than mere chance. The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, with not a snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song around in my head {{for a long time}} and I remember that when I was writing it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song. It had always been one of my favorites, Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she said how do you do/she looked into my eyes and said/my name is Baby Blue.'

500|$|In game seven at Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox held a 5–2 {{lead through}} seven innings {{due to an}} {{ineffective}} start by Roger Clemens, but the Yankees remained in the game because of three shutout innings of relief by Mike Mussina in his first career relief appearance. After Boston Red Sox starter Pedro Martínez gave up a run in the eighth, manager Grady Little visited the mound but elected to leave a tiring Martínez to complete the inning.
