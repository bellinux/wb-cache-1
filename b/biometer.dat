40|$|Purpose Accurate {{biometry}} is an obligatory preoperative {{measurement for}} refractive surgery {{as well as}} cataract surgery. A new device based on partial coherence interferometry was compared with 2 currently used biometry devices. Setting Department of Ophthalmology, Saarland University Medical Center, Homburg, Germany. Design Prospective case series. Methods Eyes of cataract patients were examined with a functional prototype of the new optical low-coherence reflectometry (OLCR) <b>biometer</b> OA- 2000, the standard OLCR <b>biometer</b> Lenstar, and the partial coherence interferometry (PCI) <b>biometer</b> IOLMaster. The results were compared using a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson correlation calculations. Results A total of 138 eyes of 74 cataract patients were examined. Pearson correlation showed excellent correlation for axial length, anterior chamber depth and keratometry among the 3 devices tested. The highest correlation was found between standard OLCR <b>biometer</b> and PCI <b>biometer</b> for AL, R 1, and R 2 (r = 1. 0, r = 0. 936, r = 0. 952, respectively; all P ≤. 001). For anterior chamber depth (ACD), the highest correlation {{was found between the}} standard OLCR <b>biometer</b> and the new OLCR <b>biometer</b> (r = 0. 943; P ≤. 001). The mean values of AL/ACD/R 1 /R 2 differed very little, but the differences were significant (all P ≤. 05) (new OLCR <b>biometer</b> 23. 31 / 3. 21 / 7. 74 / 7. 64 mm; standard OLCR <b>biometer</b> 23. 30 / 3. 13 / 7. 80 / 7. 60 mm; PCI <b>biometer</b> 23. 37 / 3. 00 / 7. 78 / 7. 6 mm). Conclusions Compared with other clinical instruments, the new OLCR <b>biometer</b> generated the most accurate results. Differences especially in measurement of axial length were statistically but not clinically significant. The new OLCR <b>biometer</b> yielded results that correlated very well with the values of the PCI <b>biometer</b> and standard OLCR <b>biometer.</b> Financial Disclosure None of the authors has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned...|$|E
40|$|PurposeTo {{evaluate}} the repeatability and reproducibility of a newer swept-source optical <b>biometer</b> and {{to compare it}} with a standard partial coherence interferometry (PCI) <b>biometer.</b> SettingSiriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. DesignProspective comparative study. MethodsOne hundred eyes from 100 cataract patients were enrolled in this study. Each patient was measured with 2 optical biometers, a newer swept-source optical <b>biometer</b> (IOLMaster 700) and a standard partial coherence interferometry <b>biometer</b> (IOLMaster 500) by 2 independent operators. The keratometry, axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth, white-to-white corneal diameter, and intraocular lens (IOL) power, calculated by the SRK/T and the Haigis formulas for each device, were recorded. Intraoperator repeatability and interoperator reproducibility of both devices were analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Agreement of ocular biometry and IOL power between the 2 devices was evaluated using the Bland-Altman method. ResultsThe repeatability and reproducibility of the swept-source and standard biometers were high for all ocular biometry parameters (ICC, 0. 93 - 1. 00). The agreement between the 2 biometers was also high (ICC, 0. 92 - 1. 00). The IOL powers obtained from both devices were not distinct. Because of {{the density of the}} cataracts, the AL in 5 eyes could be measured only by the swept-source <b>biometer.</b> ConclusionsRepeatability and reproducibility of a swept-source optical <b>biometer</b> was excellent and agreement with a standard <b>biometer</b> was very high.

40|$|AIM:To {{compare the}} intraocular lens(IOL) power {{calculations}} and refractive outcomes obtained {{with a new}} optical <b>biometer</b> and standard ultrasonic <b>biometer</b> in phacoemulsification surgery. METHODS:Thirty-seven eyes of 37 cataract patients who underwent phacoemulsification with IOL implantation were included in this prospective comparative study. The same operator performed <b>biometer</b> measurements in eyes with cataract using a new optical biometer(Aladdin) and a standard ultrasonic biometer(Sonomed AB 5500). Biometric parameters; axial length(AL), keratometric(K) readings, anterior chamber depth(ACD) and IOL power obtained by two devices were recorded. Postoperative actual refractive errors and errors predicted by two devices according to SRK/T formula were analyzed. The mean estimation error(EE), mean absolute estimation error(AEE) and the biometric parameters obtained by two biometers were compared. RESULTS:The AL measured by Aladdin(23. 45 ± 0. 73 mm) was significantly longer than AL by ultrasonic biometer(23. 2 ± 0. 75 mm) (P = 0. 01). The mean EE and AEE values obtained by Aladdin were significantly smaller than the values by ultrasonic biometer(P = 0. 0006 and 0. 03 respectively). The higher percentage of eyes within ± 0. 5 and ± 1. 00 D of target refraction was also found by using Aladdin(67 % and 97 %).

40|$|Purpose: Our {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the repeatability of measurements of axial length (AL) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) made with two ultrasonic <b>biometers</b> and the IOLMaster in a group of non-orthokeratology (ortho-k) adult subjects and to investigate the agreement among instruments in children undergoing ortho-k therapy and in children wearing spectacles. Methods: To determine repeatability, AL and ACD were measured twice in 22 non-orthok young adults using two A-scan ultrasonic <b>biometers</b> (A- 5500 and A- 2500) and the IOLMaster. To determine agreement, AL and ACD were measured with the same instruments in 30 children undergoing ortho-k therapy and 30 spectacle-wearing children. Results: In the adult subjects, {{there were no significant differences}} in ACD and AL measurements obtained from the three instruments (repeated measures ANOVAs, p > 0. 05). There was also no significant between-measurement difference for each instrument. The between-measurement agreement was better for the IOLMaster (95 % limits of agreement (LA) : - 0. 04 and + 0. 05 mm for both AL and ACD) than for the two A-scan ultrasonic <b>biometers</b> (95 % LA: - 0. 12 and + 0. 11 mm for AL; - 0. 22 and + 0. 27 mm for ACD). Among the children, AL measurements with all three instruments were not significantly different from each other for both the children undergoing ortho-k therapy and those wearing spectacles (repeated measures ANOVAs, p > 0. 05). The 95 % LA of differences obtained from any two instruments were also comparable for both groups of subjects (within - 0. 20 mm and + 0. 20 mm). ACD measurements of the children were significantly different among the three instruments (repeated measures ANOVAs, p 0. 017). Conclusions: The repeatability of AL and ACD measurements with the IOLMaster was very good, and was better than with the A-scan ultrasonic <b>biometers.</b> The agreements in AL measurements between A-scan ultrasonic <b>biometers</b> and IOLMaster were comparable in both the ortho-k and the spectacle-wearing subjects, and were comparable to the repeatability of the A-scan ultrasonic <b>biometers.</b> ACD measurements between A-scan ultrasonic biometry and the IOLMaster were not comparable. AL measurements with the IOLMaster can replace the measurements from the two A-scan ultrasonic <b>biometers</b> used, however, the reverse is not true.

The ability of each community to mineralize LAS (100 µg/L) was then assessed in <b>biometers</b> at four experimental temperatures (between 6 and 21 °C). Genetic diversity and biomass of the biofilms were assessed by genetic fingerprinting (DGGE) and direct bacterial counts. With biofilms from Sweden, where LAS was not detected in seawater (n= 3), deliberate pre-exposure to LAS resulted in lower genetic diversity and higher mineralization rate constant; however, with biofilms from Spain, where 6. 4 ± 3. 9 µgLAS/L (n= 3) was measured during the colonization, pre-exposure {{did not affect the}} bacterial community. Bacterial acclimation therefore appeared to have been induced at environmental concentrations < 6 µgLAS/L.

40|$|Soils from bulk {{pesticide}} {{mixing and}} loading (mix-load) sites are often contaminated with a complex mixture of pesticides, herbicides, and {{other organic compounds}} used in pesticide formulations that limits the success of remediation efforts. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to find remediation strategies that can successfully clean up these mix-load site soils. This paper examined the degradation of atrazine (2 -chloro- 4 -ethylamino- 6 -isopropylamino-S-triazine; AT) and alachlor (2 -chloro- 2 , 6 -diethyl-N-[methoxymethyl]-acetanilide) in contaminated mix-load site soil utilizing an extracellular fungal enzyme solution derived from the white rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, grown in a packed bed bioreactor. Thirty-two percent of AT and 54 % of AL were transformed in the <b>biometers.</b> The pseudo first-order rate constant for AT and AL biodegradation was 0. 0882 [*]d− 1 and 0. 2504 [*]d− 1, respectively. The half-life (1 / 2) for AT and AL was 8. 0 and 3. 0 days, respectively.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the central corneal {{thickness}} (CCT) measurements of four noncontact devices in healthy eyes. Materials and Methods: In a sample of 45 healthy controls, CCT was measured using an optical <b>biometer</b> (IOLMaster 700) based on swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT), high-resolution rotating Scheimpflug camera system (Pentacam HR), spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) device with an anterior segment module (Spectralis), and noncontact pachymetry (NCP) device (Topcon TRK- 2 P). Agreement among the devices was analyzed using mean differences (i. e., bias) and Bland–Altman analysis with 95 % limits of agreement (LoA). Results: Mean CCT measurements were 537. 5 ± 47. 5 μm for SS-OCT optical <b>biometer,</b> 532. 3 ± 43. 8 μm for Scheimpflug system, 521. 3 ± 44. 7 μm for SD-OCT device, and 518. 0 ± 43. 1 μm for NCP (P < 0. 001). The SD-OCT device and NCP showed the closest agreement, with a bias of 2. 6 μm (95 % LoA, − 3. 6 – 8. 8 μm), whereas the SS-OCT optical <b>biometer</b> and NCP showed the least agreement, with a bias of 18. 7 μm (95 % LoA, − 2. 1 – 39. 5 μm). Bias was 16. 1 μm (95 % LoA, − 3. 1 – 35. 3 μm) for SS-OCT optical <b>biometer</b> and SD-OCT, 5. 1 μm (95 % LoA, − 6. 8 – 17. 0 μm) for SS-OCT optical <b>biometer</b> and Scheimpflug system, 10. 9 μm (95 % LoA, − 15. 1 – 36. 9 μm) for SD-OCT device and Scheimpflug system, and 13. 6 μm (95 % LoA, − 5 – 32. 2 μm) for Scheimpflug system and NCP. Conclusions: SS-OCT optical <b>biometer</b> overestimates CCT measurements compared to Scheimpflug system, SD-OCT device, and NCP.

The angle of gaze has a small but significant short-term effect on axial length, with greatest elongation occurring in inferonasal gaze. The elongation of the eye appears to be due to the influence of the extraocular muscles, in particular the oblique muscles...|$|E
40|$|Comparison of two {{personal}} ultraviolet index monitors for sun {{awareness in}} South Africa Exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation {{is known to}} have both adverse and beneficial consequences for human health. Sunburn and skin cancer are probably the most well-known acute and chronic adverse health impacts. These themes have recently been discussed in the media for the general public; consequently interest in sun protection is growing. The promotion of the use of practical personal strategies to reduce adverse health risks, such as healthy sun behaviour, sun protection mechanisms and solar ultraviolet radiation awareness tools, is increasing. One such tool is the personal UV index (UVI) monitor, promoted commercially as a viable tool for sun awareness; however, such instruments have not been scientifically evaluated in a South African context. Here, two different types of personal UVI monitors, commercially available in South Africa, were compared with a research-grade UVB <b>biometer</b> for a continuous 7 -h period on 02 March 2012 in Pretoria. One of the two personal UVI monitors showed reasonable agreement with the UVB <b>biometer,</b> whereas the other monitor overestimated UVI by up to 4 UVI units. When comparing two identical products manufactured by the same company, one monitor overestimated UVI twofold, suggesting inter-instrument variability may be a concern.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{agreement}} of anterior segment parameter measurements derived from Aladdin optical <b>biometer</b> using optical low coherence interferometer and Sirius corneal topography using combined Scheimpflug-Placido disk. Materials and Methods: Data obtained using the Aladdin and Sirius systems from 110 eyes of 59 subjects who had no health problems other than refractive errors were retrospectively evaluated. Anterior chamber depth (ACD), flat (K 1) and steep (K 2) keratometry readings, and white-to-white distance (WTW) measurements taken with both devices were noted. Results: The {{mean age of the}} patients was 47. 31 ± 18. 57 years (range, 25 to 79 years). Mean ACD was 3. 35 ± 0. 4 mm using Aladdin and 3. 42 ± 0. 44 mm using Sirius. Mean difference in ACD was 0. 075 mm greater with Sirius than Aladdin (p< 0. 001). K 1 measurement obtained by Aladdin was an average of 0. 409 D higher (p< 0. 001). No statistically significant differences were detected between the two devices in respect to K 2 and WTW measurements (p= 0. 18, p= 0. 85 respectively). Pearson correlation analysis showed high correlation between the two devices for all measurements (r= 0. 985, 0. 895, 0. 961 and 0. 766 for ACD, K 1, K 2 and WTW respectively; p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Anterior segment parameters obtained by Aladdin optical <b>biometer</b> and Sirius anterior segment analysis system correlated well with each other and measurement differences between the devices were clinically negligible except for K 1 values...|$|E

MethodsOptical simulations were produced for theoretical eyes using Zemax-EE software. Thirty-three combinations including eleven different AL (from 20 mm to 30 mm in 1 mm steps) and three different LT (3. 6 mm, 4. 2 mm and 4. 8 mm) were used. Errors were obtained comparing the AL measured for a constant equivalent refractive index of 1. 3549 and for the actual combinations of indices and intra-ocular dimensions of LT and AL in each model eye. ResultsIn the range from 20 mm to 30 mm AL and 3. 6 – 4. 8 mm LT, the instrument measurements yielded an error between − 0. 043 mm and + 0. 089 mm. Regression analyses for the three LT condition were combined in order to derive a correction factor {{as a function of the}} instrument measured AL for each combination of AL and LT in the theoretical eye. ConclusionsThe assumption of a single “average” refractive index in the estimation of AL by the IOLMaster PCI <b>biometer</b> only induces very small errors in a wide range of combinations of ocular dimensions.

40|$|Aim. The OA- 1000 (Tomey, Japan) {{is a new}} optical <b>biometer,</b> which {{measures}} axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and central corneal thickness (CT) utilizing optical interference technology. The {{aim of this study}} was to prove the reproducibility which is considered fundamental for other clinical investigations. Methods. 55 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. For each measurement of AL, ACD, and CT the <b>biometer</b> is grabbing a sequence of 10 shots and mean value (mean) and standard deviation (SD) are displayed. Five consecutive measurements were performed and average and standard deviation were assessed. Cronbach’s α was derived as a quality measure for reproducibility. Results. For AL measurement Cronbach’s α was 1. 000, for CT 0. 999, and for ACD 0. 979, respectively. Mean value for AL was 23. 36 ± 1. 03 [*]mm, for ACD it was 3. 60 ± 0. 687 [*]mm, and for CT it was 552. 08 ± 29. 70 [*]μm, respectively. Standard deviation for AL was 0. 013 ± 0. 022 [*]mm, for ACD 0. 09 ± 0. 11 [*]mm, and for CT 2. 18 ± 1. 75 [*]μm. One correlation was found between mean values for AL and ACD (R =  0. 388, P =  0. 005); no other correlations were found between mean values or values of standard deviation of AL, ACD, or CT. Conclusion. The OA- 1000 shows an excellent reproducibility for measurement of AL, ACD, and CT and can be used in clinical practice...|$|E

40|$|International audienceErythemaly {{weighted}} UV {{and total}} UVA irradiance {{measured at the}} ALOMAR (Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research; 69 ° N, 16 ° E) in June 2007 by two Kipp & Zonen UV broadband meters type, UV-S-AE-T, are examined. One unit is movable and mounted to rotating vertical plane, {{and the other is}} permanently fixed horizontally. The UV broadband meters measure simultaneously to allow the comparison of UV irradiances on vertical and horizontal plane. The entire range of relative exposure variations during clear-sky conditions over ALOMAR is examined using STAR and Radonic 1 model (developed at the Meteorological Institute, Munich) for various action spectra (erythema, UVA, and vitamin D 3). It seems that multiplication of the daily mean dose from a standard broadband meter placed horizontally by 0. 5 gives reasonable estimation of the daily mean exposure on a vertical plane randomly oriented towards Sun. The extreme value and daily variability of relative exposure are the highest for UVA, next for UVB, then for vitamin D 3 weighed UV irradiance. The minima of relative exposure (~ 0. 20 ? 0. 30) are almost the same for all weighting functions. Specific cloud configuration could lead to significant enhancement of UV relative exposure of rotating plane being the most pronounced when <b>biometer</b> is in shadow. A statistical model is proposed, that it is able to simulate vitamin D 3 weighted UV irradiances on vertical surface using explanatory variables: erythemal and total UVA irradiance from standard (horizontal) observations by Kipp & Zonen dual band <b>biometer,</b> the orientation of vertical plane, solar zenith angle, and column amount of total ozone. Statistical model will allow to reconstruct (or monitor) vitamin D 3 weighted UV irradiances using available past (or actual) data...|$|E
40|$|This {{retrospective}} study {{was performed to}} compare refractive outcomes measured by conventional methods and by use of the Lenstar <b>biometer</b> and to investigate the factors affecting intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation with Lenstar with and without IOL-constant optimization. The study included 100 eyes of 86 patients who underwent cataract surgery. Corneal curvature was measured with a manual keratometer (MK), automated keratometer (AK), and the Lenstar <b>biometer,</b> and axial length (AL) was measured by A-scan and Lenstar. Mean numerical error (MNE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were compared between AK and MK with A-scan, and Lenstar with and without optimization. Factors affecting {{the accuracy of the}} IOL power calculation by use of Lenstar with and without optimization were analyzed. No significant differences were observed in the MNE or MAE among the devices. The proportion of MAE within 0. 5 D was higher for Lenstar with optimization (62. 7 %) than without optimization (46. 2 %). The proportion of MAE within 0. 5 D was 62 % and 58 % for MK and AK with A-scan, respectively. Without optimization, the MAE was smaller in eyes with ALs be-tween 23 mm and 25 mm (p= 0. 03), whereas it was smaller at higher corneal powers when the IOL constant was optimized (＞ 44 D, p= 0. 03). The IOL power calculations showed no significant differences among the devices, but the results of MAE within 0. 5 D by use of Lenstar without optimization were worse than those of conventional methods. The AL influenced the accuracy of refractive outcomes determined by using Lenstar without optimization, and corneal curvature was shown to affect the accuracy of refractive measurements using Lenstar with optimization.

40|$|Abstract. The daily {{doses of}} the erythemally {{weighted}} UV radiation are reconstructed for three sites in Central Europe: Belsk-Poland (1966 – 2001), Hradec Kralove-Czech Repub-lic (1964 – 2001), and Tõravere-Estonia (1967 – 2001) to dis-cuss the UV climatology and the long-term changes of the UV-B radiation since the mid 1960 s. Various reconstruc-tion models are examined: a purely statistical model based on the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) methodology, and a hybrid model combining radiative trans-fer model calculations with empirical estimates of the cloud effects on the UV radiation. Modeled long-term variations of the surface UV doses {{appear to be in}} a reasonable agreement with the observed ones. A simple quality control procedure is proposed to check the homogeneity of the <b>biometer</b> and pyra-nometer data. The models are verified using the results of U...|$|E
