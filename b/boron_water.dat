40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} health {{impact of}} boron in drinking water. METHODS: A regional scale geographical study in Northern France was conducted. Assessment of boron blood levels {{in a group}} of 180 healthy individuals and correlation with boron content in drinking water were followed by an assessment of health indicators such as birth rates, mortality rates, and sex ratios in zones of different boron content in drinking water. RESULTS: After necessary adjustments, men living in municipalities with more than 0. 30 mg/L of boron in drinking water had elevated but not significant boron blood levels compared with those living in municipalities with <b>boron</b> <b>water</b> levels of less than 0. 30 mg/L (159. 1 versus 123. 0 ng/g; p > 0. 05). The standardized birth ratio adjusted for the reference geographic zone and calendar time period was 1. 07 and 1. 28 in the low and high (> 0. 3 mg/L) boron content municipalities, respectively. The birth rate in municipalities with high boron content in drinking water was higher than that of the reference geographic zone and of the French general population (p < 10 (- 4)). The standardized mortality ratio adjusted for the reference geographic zone and calendar time period was 0. 94 and 0. 92 in the low and high boron content municipalities, respectively. The mortality rate in municipalities with high boron content in drinking water was less than that of the reference geographic zone and of the French general population (p < 10 (- 3)). No statistical difference was noted in the male-female sex ratios between the different municipality zones (p = 0. 45). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not support the idea of a deleterious effect of boron on human health, at the <b>boron</b> <b>water</b> level contents found in this specific region. In fact, there is a tendency toward a beneficial effect with low-dose environmental exposure (less than 1 mg/L of boron) in drinking water...|$|E

Water measurements are based on re-analysis and/or re-processing of data previously reported in the literature. Analyzed olivines have lithium, <b>boron,</b> and <b>water</b> concentrations of 0. 9 – 7. 8 and 0. 01 – 67, and 0. 8 – 61 ppm (by weight), respectively. One olivine from Kingiti, Tanzania (possibly derived from metasomatized peridotite) is anomalous, with boron and lithium contents of 67 and 7. 8 ppm, respectively. The remaining olivine samples have lithium and boron contents below 3 and 1 ppm, respectively.

40|$|Eighteen field plots at 15 {{locations}} {{were selected}} {{throughout the state}} to evaluate {{the status of the}} boron content in irrigation waters, soils, and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) plant tissue under irrigated conditions. No boron deficiency symptoms were observed in any of the alfalfa plants at any of these locations, nor were any of the plant tissue boron levels inadequate. Only two locations were found in which the alfalfa plants exibited toxicity symptoms. These locations were along the Indian and Antelope Creeks in Duchesne County which contain high boron levels in the water. All the alfalfa and soil tested and irrigated by either Indian or Antelope Creek waters are the only ones tested and found to contain, naturally occuring, high levels of boron in Utah. The light sandy soils were found to contain less available boron than the heavier clay soils. The sandy soil of the Grand County location at Moab showed no available soil boron, while the clayey soils in Duchesne County irrigated with high <b>boron</b> <b>waters</b> were the only soils found to contain excessive levels of available soil boron.

The adsorption behavior of 59 elements on the synthesized resin was systematically examined by using the resin packed in a mini-column, passing water samples through it and measuring the adsorbed elements in eluates by ICP-MS. The CCTS-NMDG resin shows high ability in boron sorption with the capacity of 0. 61 mmol ml(- 1) (= 2. 1 mmol g(- 1)). The sorption kinetics of this resin was faster than that of the commercially available resins. Other advantages of the synthesized resin are: (1) quantitative collection of boron at neutral pH regions; (2) complete removal of large amounts of matrices; (3) no loss of efficiency over prolonged usage; (4) effective collection of boron in wide range concentration using a mini column containing 1 ml resin; (5) complete elution of boron with 1 mol 1 (- 1) nitric acid.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundBoron is a {{metalloid}} {{found at}} highly varying concentrations in soil and water. Experimental {{data indicate that}} boron is a developmental toxicant, but the few human toxicity data available concern mostly male reproduction. ObjectivesTo evaluate potential effects of boron exposure through drinking water on pregnancy outcomes. MethodsIn a mother-child cohort in northern Argentina (n= 194), 1 – 3 samples of serum, whole blood and urine were collected per woman during pregnancy and analyzed for boron and other elements to which exposure occurred, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Infant weight, length and head circumference were measured at birth. ResultsDrinking <b>water</b> <b>boron</b> ranged 377 – 10, 929 μg/L. The serum boron concentrations during pregnancy ranged 0. 73 – 605 μg/L (median 133 μg/L) and correlated strongly with whole-blood and urinary boron, and, to a lesser extent, with <b>water</b> <b>boron.</b> In multivariable-adjusted linear spline regression analysis (non-linear association), we found that serum boron concentrations above 80 μg/L were inversely associated with birth length (B− 0. 69 cm, 95 % CI − 1. 4; − 0. 024, p= 0. 043, per 100 μg/L increase in serum boron). The impact of boron appeared stronger when we restricted the exposure to the third trimester, when the serum boron concentrations were the highest (0. 73 – 447 μg/L). An increase in serum boron of 100 μg/L in the third trimester corresponded to 0. 9 cm shorter and 120 g lighter newborns (p= 0. 001 and 0. 021, respectively). ConclusionsConsidering that elevated boron concentrations in drinking water are common {{in many areas of}} the world, although more screening is warranted, our novel findings warrant additional research on early-life exposure in other populations...|$|R

The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of Boron, foliar applied, in different phenological phases on the productivity of the tree and, consequently, on fruit set and nut quality. The study was carried out in Sicily, by applying the element on 'Bianca' cv and 'Gloria' selection. During flowering time (25 - 50 % flowers bloomed), the trees of 'Bianca' were sprayed with <b>Boron</b> solved in <b>water</b> only or in sucrose solution (to favorite the pollen's receptivity on the stigma).

The important role of boric acid in nuclear power plant is to control nuclear fission rate and to influence the power generation of nuclear power plant (Odar 2007). Generally speaking, the rate of nuclear fission is controlled by neutron flux, which is released by that process, and boron is an atom that absorbs neutrons with perfect effect. 10 B (one of B isotope) has very strong absorption ability, whose neutron absorption cross section of thermal neutron is five times more than boron with natural abundance, 20 times than graphite, and 500 times than traditional protective material of concrete. For that reason, the rate of nuclear fission can be controlled by injecting boric acid into a nuclear power furnace with 10 B. Boric acid is prepared in a system consisting of <b>boron</b> and <b>water</b> supply, and enters into chemical volume control system by boron adding loop. The chemical volume control system controls the reactivity of the reactor by controlling boric acid concentration of the loop, and then further controls the power and safety of the reactor (Wootten et al. 1985; Mark 1989; Song and Lee 2003; Staudt et al. 2002).|$|R

40|$|Boron is a {{ubiquitous}} {{element in}} the environment and is required for normal plant development. It is not classed as essential for animals or humans but is known to influence many processes within the body such as macromineral metabolism, bone development, immune function, inflammatory disease and the functions of several enzymes. The problem of boron toxicity in the environment is a relatively rare situation when compared to deficiency status. The region of San Jose de Jachal, San Juan (SJ), Argentina, provided a unique area of investigation as it suffers from enhanced levels of <b>boron</b> in <b>waters,</b> soils, sediments and plants. This work has investigated the impact of boron and other key elements (namely As, Cd, Ca, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mg, Mn, K, Se, Na and Zn) in this region {{with respect to the}} environmental levels and the effect on the human population, through scalp hair analysis. This was compared to a second 'control' area of Argentina, namely General Roca, Rio Negro (RN). In order to achieve this, validated sample preparation methods were developed and optimised analytical conditions were used for measurement by a variety of techniques, namely flame atomic absorption spectrometry, atomic emission spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and molecular spectroscopy. This work showed that boron in the main river system in SJ ranged from 2. 2 to 7. 1 mg/l whereas RN waters were found to contain 0. 03 - 2. 3 mg/l. The sediments showed a similar trend, with levels ranging from 25 - 147 mg/kg for SJ and 34 - 93 mg/l for RN. Significant correlations (P< 0. 05) were found between water and sediment levels, and statistical differences were observed between the two populations for <b>boron</b> in <b>waters</b> and sediment (P< 0. 05). Additionally, the mobility of boron in grapevines and wine was examined. Whilst {{it was not possible to}} determine the mechanism of transport through the plant, boron is a labile element and was found in appreciable quantities in the resultant grape juice and wine. A database of elemental levels in wine (B, Ba, Ca, Cu, Pb, Li, Mg, Mn, Rb, Sr and Zn) was produced in order to compare wines from SJ to other countries. In general, no major differences were observed which could have substantial impact on the local economy if wine were to be produced in this region. The application of chemometrics was also explored using the wine data. The use of scalp hair as a biomonitor for boron (and other key elements) in relation to the health status of the two populations was uniquely described.

Pearson correlation coefficient analysis showed {{that there is a}} close relationship between the ICP-AES and the titrimetric method and the determination coefficient (R 2) was calculated to be 91. 34 %...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to investigate changes in growth performance, immune organs weight and microstructure of broilers fed different levels of boron (0, 100, 200 and 400 mg/L) in drinking water for 6 weeks. A total of 240 newly-hatched Gushi chickens [body weight (BW) = 34 ± 2 kg; male: female= 1 : 1] were equally divided into 4 treatments with 5 pens each (n= 12 per pen). The birds were weighed after fasting for 12 h every two weeks {{until the end of}} experiment. The thymus, bursa and spleen samples were collected every two weeks and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde phosphate buffer at room temperature (25 °C). Results showed that BW and average daily gain significantly reduced by addition of 200 and 400 mg/L <b>boron</b> to drinking <b>water</b> compared to control group (P 200 mg/L) could significantly inhibit the growth of immune organs and even exhibit toxic effects...|$|R
40|$|Various {{techniques}} including {{conventional and}} advanced have been employed for the <b>boron</b> treatment from <b>water</b> and wastewater. The electrocoagulation involves an electrolytic reactor for coagulation/flotation with aluminium as anode and cathode. There is aluminium as coagulant {{to be used}} for removal which may induce secondary pollution in chemical coagulation. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate and compare the performance between electrocoagulation and chemical coagulation on boron removal from synthetic wastewater. The effect of different parameters, such as pH reaction, coagulant dosage, and initial boron concentration were examined. The results show that the boron removal using chemical coagulation was lower. At the optimum condition (e. g. pH 8 and 0. 8 mol coagulant dosage), boron removal efficiencies for chemical coagulation and electrocoagulation were 61 % and 91 %, respectively. In addition, the electrocoagulation needs no chemical reagents and makes the boron treatment easy for application...|$|R
40|$|Germination of pear pollen {{markedly}} improved when {{boric acid}} {{was added to}} the medium. The pollen was more sensitive to <b>boron</b> in <b>water</b> than in 10 % sugar solution. Supplying weak solutions of boron to pear branches before flowering resulted in a good germination of the pollen in sugar solution without boron. Spraying apple-trees and pear-trees with boron solutions had no significant effect on fruit set, despite the pollen sensitivity to boron in vitro. The amount of boric acid in the medium determined percentage germination (saturation curve) and length of pollen tubes. Boron was not required until the tubes protruded. Temperature and sugar concentration both showed optimum values for germination. The effect of boron on germination rate was positively correlated with temperature and negatively with sugar concentration. An increase of 10 °C roughly doubled this influence on germination rate. Germination was positively correlated with pollen grain number per drop, whether or not boron was present. So the mutual stimulation of the pollen was more effective with boron or with pollen from rather boron-rich branches. Pollen extracts in 10 % sugar solution with or without boron stimulated germination (also of other species). Both apple and pear pollen (and those of many other species) remained viable longest at both low humidity and temperature. In deep-freeze longevity was more than 2 years at - 180 °. Viability remained unchanged. Longevity would probably have been indefinite. <p/...|$|R
40|$|Revised 1 / 2012. "Soil {{testing is}} a process {{or a group of}} {{processes}} used to estimate the ability of a soil to supply plant nutrients or support plant growth. Soil test results enable evaluation of the fertility status of soil represented by a sample. Fertilizer and lime recommendations can then be made based on the soil's fertility status. This allows prudent and economical use of fertilizer and lime while providing crops with sufficient nutrients to reach production goals set for a field. In addition, soil testing can be used to find excesses of certain nutrients. The soil testing process consists of: sampling, sample preparation, nutrient extraction and chemical determination of these nutrients, determination of pH and quantity of soil acidity, and evaluation of the tests resulting in fertilizer and lime recommendations.

40|$|Present paper {{focuses on}} physico-chemical {{characteristics}} of Hebbal and Challaghatta basins, Bangalore with special reference to fluoride, nitrate and boron concentration. During the pre-monsoon of 2011, the NO^sub 3 ^^sup -^ content {{is as high}} as (100 mg/l) in 12 % of wells having depth of less than 42 feet, whereas 88 % of samples from wells having depth of more than 799 feet showed < 100 mg/l of NO^sub 3 ^^sup -^. The higher NO^sub 3 ^^sup -^ along shallow open wells is therefore attributed to sewage contamination. Pesticides and fertilizers used in agricultural activities are also contributing significant amounts of fluoride to the groundwater regime in Hebbal and Challaghatta aquifers. In the Hebbal and Challaghatta valleys, the industrial applications of boron that apparently could affect the groundwater system are washing powder and agricultural applications of boron-fertilizers and boron-pesticides. The high content of <b>boron</b> in several <b>water</b> sources is signal for restricting the use of washing powder containing boron...|$|R
