500|$|Kove's first {{ideas for}} The Danish Poet began {{when she went}} {{through a period of}} self-assessment; she wanted to write a story about what she {{described}} as when [...] "you reach a turning point or a milestone and you look <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> think 'how in the heck did I get here?' [...] And you realize that the answer lies somewhere in a complex web of all kinds of stuff, like genetic make-up, upbringing, coincidences, choices you made along the way, missed opportunities, [...] lucky breaks." [...] She felt that it was a natural choice to centre on a relationship between two people, [...] "because relationships, and especially the romantic ones, play a huge role in shaping our lives, and also, obviously, in creating new ones." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his four}} years at Michigan, Woolfolk had what one {{reporter}} described as [...] "a strange love-hate relationship" [...] with Coach Bo Schembechler. Woolfolk noted at the time Schembechler is a [...] "tough coach", and it was [...] "not easy at all" [...] playing for him. Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk's tendency to try to run around defenders rather than banging through them, resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once. But Schembechler said Woolfolk [...] "came of age" [...] in the November 1980 Ohio State game. After Woolfolk's MVP performance in the 1981 Rose Bowl helped Schembechler to his first bowl game victory, Bo complimented Woolfolk's powerful performance, noting: [...] "Butch {{can be a real}} load." [...] By the 1981 season, Schembechler was a true believer in Woolfolk, saying: [...] "Today, I can say without reservation, that I'd rather go into a big game with Woolfolk at tailback than any other back in the country." [...] Woolfolk, too, concluded in the end that Schembechler was [...] "key" [...] to his success: [...] "He kept after me. He kept saying I was getting too fancy. He kept saying, 'You're a big back, a fast <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> ought to be running over people -- not trying to dance around them.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Mayor Rob Ford {{called for}} the Danzig Street {{shooters}} to be expelled from the city, saying: [...] "I want these {{people out of the}} city. And I'm not going to stop. Not put 'em in jail, then come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can live in the city. No. I want 'em out of the city. Go somewhere else. I don't want 'em living in the city anymore." [...] The day after the shooting, he added, [...] "We must use every legal means to make life for these thugs miserable, to put them behind bars, or to run them out of town. We will not rest until being a gang member is a miserable, undesirable life. Ford called for longer prison sentences and decried [...] "hug a thug" [...] social programs, voting against accepting federal grants worth more than $16million.|$|E

2500|$|Buckley's {{premature}} death inspired many artists he knew or influenced to write songs {{in tribute to}} the late singer. PJ Harvey knew him personally and in the song [...] "Memphis" [...] she takes lines from a song on his unfinished album, [...] "Morning Theft", and {{in her own words}} reflects on Buckley's death: [...] "In Memphis...die suddenly, at a wonderful age, we're ready to go". Chris Cornell wrote [...] "Wave Goodbye", which appeared on his first solo album, Euphoria Morning, for Buckley. Rufus Wainwright, whose fledgling career had barely started when he met Buckley, wrote [...] "Memphis Skyline" [...] in tribute to him, singing [...] "then came hallelujah sounding like Ophelia, for me in my room living, turn <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will stay, under the Memphis Skyline". Duncan Sheik's [...] "A Body Goes Down", from his 1998 album Humming, was a response to Buckley's death. Steve Adey wrote a song tribute entitled [...] "Mississippi" [...] on his 2006 album All Things Real. The song contains the lyrics [...] "Until the morning thief steals the humming of the Lord", a reference to Buckley's song [...] "Morning Theft".|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Mahal has {{performed}} his brand of blues (an African American artform) for {{a predominantly white}} audience. This has been a disappointment at times for Mahal, who recognizes {{there is a general}} lack of interest in blues music among many African Americans today. He has drawn a parallel comparison between the blues and rap music in that they both were initially black forms of music that have come to be assimilated into the mainstream of society. He is quoted as saying, [...] "Eighty-one percent of the kids listening to rap were not black kids. Once there was a tremendous amount of money involved in it... they totally moved it over to a material side. It just went off to a terrible direction." [...] Mahal also believes that some people may think the blues are about wallowing in negativity and despair, a position he disagrees with. According to him, [...] "You can listen to my music from front to <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> don't ever hear me moaning and crying about how bad you done treated me. I think that style of blues and that type of tone was something that happened as a result of many white people feeling very, very guilty about what went down." ...|$|E
