5|$|John de Breton (died c. 12 May 1275) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Hereford. He {{served as a}} royal justice and sheriff before being {{nominated}} to Hereford. He is sometimes credited with the legal treatise Britton; <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> current form Breton cannot be the author as the work refers to laws written 15 years after the bishop's death.|$|E
5|$|The opera's appeal lay {{not only}} in its story about a {{crippled}} shepherd boy healed on the first Christmas Eve <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> wedding of opera and the limitations of television. The broad effects of theater were eschewed and instead an intimacy appropriate to the television studio and home viewing was cultivated. The production starred Chet Allen as Amahl and Rosemary Kuhlmann as his mother. Kuhlmann reprised her role annually for many years.|$|E
5|$|The Hamar-based {{newspaper}} Demokraten ("The Democrat") {{was started}} on 15 September 1909. The initiator and first editor was Olav Kringen, who had ample experience as {{the editor of}} Social-Demokraten from 1903 until 1906. Demokraten was the Labour Party organ for the Mjøsa Cities and Hedemarken, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> first years it also covered Gudbrandsdalen and Østerdalen, two northern regions. The name Østoplandenes Socialistiske Partiblad was considered for the newspaper, but the historical name Demokraten prevailed. The name was suggested by local Labour MP Karl Amundsen. Demokratens coverage of Gudbrandsdalen soon ended, and in southern Østerdalen a new labour newspaper, Østerdalens Arbeiderblad, {{was set up in}} 1915. In northern Østerdalen, Arbeidets Rett was popular among the labour movement. According to reports in Demokraten the newspaper again began to cover news from a part of Gudbrandsdalen, namely the city Lillehammer, in 1912.|$|E

5|$|The Plum River raid was a bloodless {{skirmish}} {{that occurred}} at present-day Savanna, Illinois, on May 21, 1832, {{as part of}} the Black Hawk War. Most of the settlement's inhabitants, except for a few defenders, had fled for Galena, Illinois, before the raid happened. A small band of Native Americans, either Sauk or Fox, attacked the settlement while only three of the six defenders were present. The men who were present fell back to the blockhouse and a firefight ensued for about one hour, after which the attackers withdrew. No one was killed or injured during the attack, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> aftermath Colonel James M. Strode dispatched a detachment of militia to Savanna. They returned to Galena without incident and the settlement at Savanna was temporarily abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In early 2000, Croatia and Serbia {{set up a}} {{commission}} tasked with determining the border, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> first ten years it convened only once or twice. Since 2010, the issue has gained increasing prominence in the disputing countries. Plans for construction of a port in Apatin, {{on a piece of}} territory claimed by Croatia, added fuel to the dispute. After years of inactivity the inter-governmental commission established to identify and determine the border between Croatia and Serbia met in Zagreb in April 2010, only to conclude that there was a difference of opinions on the matter. Later that month, the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) proposed a National Assembly resolution which would require that Serbian officials resolve the dispute in compliance with the Serbian claim. Months later, Radoslav Stojanović, a former legal representative of Serbia and Montenegro in the Bosnian Genocide Case and former ambassador to the Netherlands, likened the dispute to the Croatia–Slovenia border dispute in the Gulf of Piran. Stojanović said that the position held by Croatia in its dispute with Slovenia was favourable for Serbia and warned that Serbia might be in a disadvantageous position if Croatia joined the European Union (EU) before Serbia—which would allow it to impose its conditions to the process of accession of Serbia to the EU.|$|E

25|$|Although, then, it is {{impossible}} to establish any sort of mutual dependence, it is evident that the Roman Canon contains likenesses to the two Eastern rites too exact to be accidental; in its forms it most resembles the Antiochene Anaphora, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> arrangement it follows, or guides, Alexandria.|$|E
25|$|These epithets are {{associated}} with the ritual function of Janus in the opening of the Porta Ianualis or Porta Belli. The rite might go back to times pre-dating the founding of Rome.

25|$|Recent {{molecular}} data (particularly {{the production of}} plumbagin) indicate that the remaining flypaper, Triphyophyllum peltatum, {{a member of the}} Dioncophyllaceae, is closely related to Drosophyllum and forms part of a larger clade of carnivorous and non-carnivorous plants with the Droseraceae, Nepenthaceae, Ancistrocladaceae and Plumbaginaceae. This plant is usually encountered as a liana, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> juvenile phase, the plant is carnivorous. This may be related to a requirement for specific nutrients for flowering.|$|E

25|$|Craig Evans {{states that}} an {{argument}} in favor of the partial authenticity of the Testimonium is that the passage does not exaggerate the role played by the Jewish leaders in the death of Jesus.

25|$|The first honours {{list with}} awards of the Canada Medal {{was to be}} {{released}} on 11 November 1943.

Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King was {{not in favor of}} awarding the medal, so the medal was not awarded. Between its creation and 1966, the Canada Medal was an official decoration of Canada, the first award of merit created for Canadians by the Canadian government <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> history, was never awarded.

In January 1916, after replying favourably to a letter from Booth advocating African political representation, he was required to leave Nyasaland and was sent to Chinde as a clerk but was transferred to Zomba in 1917. In 1919, {{he was allowed to}} return to Mzimba district, where he worked until 1927 as a government clerk. He then returned to preaching and teaching in the Seventh-day Baptist church until resuming work for the government in 1934. Nothing further is known of his history, except that he occasionally communicated with the Seventh-day Baptists in America until his death some time in the late 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Further {{expansion}} of the league followed in 1988, with another three teams based outside Sydney introduced to the competition; the Newcastle Knights and the first two Queensland teams, the Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast-Tweed Giants. The Brisbane and Newcastle sides proved to be successful and popular and paved the way towards a push for a truly national competition. This was attempted in 1995 with control of the premiership passing from the NSWRFL to the Australian Rugby League (ARL), who invited four more teams from outside NSW to participate in 1995. Ultimately this competition failed, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> demise the National Rugby League was born, incorporating the traditional Sydney clubs, successfully coercing the Sydney market to follow the newly created national competition.|$|E

It was the time when “no music was valued in Russia more than gypsy music, when to love the gypsies and prefer them to Italians didn’t seem strange” according to Leo Tolstoy. A guitarist virtuoso, singer, dancer and song composer Ilya Sokolov was a favourite of Moscow and Saint-Petersburg. “Not a man, but flame and lighting”, - the newspapers said about him. “The sound of Sokolov’ guitar still rings in ears”, - was sung decades after. The Sokolov’s choir performed Russian songs and romances, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> own way, giving the music a wild sultry sound. Vivacity of gypsy dance came to frenzy.
