40|$|Interspecific {{hybridization}} {{of various}} <b>tuberous</b> <b>Begonia</b> species hybrids with Begonia socotrana results in so-called 'Elatior'-begonias hybrids (B. x hiemalis Fotsch). In our study, genomic {{in situ hybridization}} (GISH) has been employed to assess the genome composition in eleven 'Elatior'-begonias hybrids and their ancestor genotypes. Genomic DNA of <b>tuberous</b> <b>Begonia</b> was sonicated to 1 - 10 -kb fragments, labelled by nick translation with digoxigenin- 11 -dUTP and used as a probe whereas B. socotrana DNA was autoclaved to 100 bp fragments and used as block. The genome of <b>tuberous</b> <b>Begonia</b> was clearly pronounced in 'Elatior'-begonias when the probe concentration was similar to 3. 75 ng/mu l (150 ng/slide), with 30 times the excess of B. socotrana blocking DNA and stringency of post hybridization washings at 73 % (0. 1 x SSC at 42 A degrees C). In 'Elatior'-begonias hybrids GISH distinguished two groups comprising short (0. 6 - 1. 03 mu m in length) and relatively longer chromosomes (1. 87 - 3. 88 mu m) which represent B. socotrana and <b>tuberous</b> <b>Begonia</b> genomes, respectively. The number of chromosomes derived from <b>tuberous</b> <b>Begonia</b> ranged from 14 to 56 and for B. socotrana from 7 to 28 which suggest the presence of different ploidy levels in analyzed 'Elatior'-begonia hybrids. Intergenomic recombination has not been detected through GISH in hybrids analyzed. Genomic in situ hybridization {{turned out to be}} useful to identify the genome constitution of 'Elatior'-begonia hybrids and thus gain an insight into the origins of these cultivars. This knowledge on the ploidy level and genome composition is essential for further progress in breeding Begonias...|$|R

50|$|The public {{conservatory}} {{was constructed}} in 1912 {{with the objective of}} grouping various flowering plants. Colourful annuals and perennials like Cineraria, Schizanthus, Calceolaria, Balsam, Cyclamen, Gloxinia, <b>Tuberous</b> <b>begonia,</b> Coleus, Geranium, Chrysanthemum, Primulas, Tydea, Achemenes etc., find a place in this conservatory.|$|R
50|$|Near Arequipa in Peru, he also {{discovered}} a new species of <b>tuberous</b> <b>begonia,</b> Begonia davisii, which was also named after him. B. davisii was later used {{in the early days}} of breeding Begonia × tuberhybrida cultivars by John Seden in the Veitch Nurseries at Coombe Wood.|$|R

5000|$|John Seden (1840-1921) was a hybridist and {{horticulturist}} {{best known}} for the hybrids he created while in the employment of Veitch Nurseries.

50|$|Fruit {{bodies have}} {{successfully}} been {{grown in the}} laboratory. R. Ower {{was the first to}} describe the developmental stages of ascomata grown in a controlled chamber. This was followed by in-depth cytological studies by Thomas Volk and Leonard (1989, 1990). To study the morel life cycle they followed the development of ascoma fruiting in association with <b>tuberous</b> <b>begonias</b> (Begonia tuberhybrida), from very small primordia to fully developed fruit bodies.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} plant's {{introduction}} to England, John Seden, the foreman at James Veitch & Sons of Chelsea, London, successfully crossed B. boliviensis and another Andean species, {{believed to be}} B. veitchii. This was the first hybrid <b>tuberous</b> <b>begonia</b> raised in England. The new hybrid variety was named B. × sedenii after him and was distributed in 1870, having been awarded the Silver Floral Medal by the Royal Horticultural Society.|$|R

50|$|Kimjongilia is {{a flower}} {{named after the}} late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. It is a hybrid {{cultivar}} of <b>tuberous</b> <b>begonia,</b> registered as Begonia × tuberhybrida 'Kimjongilhwa'. When Kim Jong-il died in December 2011 the flower was used to adorn his corpse for public display. Despite its name, the Kimjongilia is not the official national flower of North Korea, which is the Magnolia sieboldii. Another flower, Kimilsungia, is an orchid cultivar named after Kim Jong-il's father and predecessor, Kim Il-sung.|$|R
5000|$|The {{different}} groups of begonias have different cultural requirements, but most species come from tropical regions, so they and their hybrids require warm temperatures. Most are forest understory plants and require bright shade; few will tolerate full sun, especially in warmer climates. In general, begonias require a well-drained growing medium that is neither constantly wet nor allowed to dry out completely. Many begonias will grow and flower year-round except for <b>tuberous</b> <b>begonias,</b> which usually have a dormant period. During this dormant period, the tubers {{can be stored in}} a cool, dry place. Begonias of the semperflorens group (or wax begonias) are frequently grown as bedding plants outdoors. A recent group of hybrids derived from this group is marketed as [...] "Dragonwing" [...] begonias; they are much larger both in leaf and in flower. <b>Tuberous</b> <b>begonias</b> are frequently used as container plants. Although most Begonia species are tropical or subtropical in origin, the Chinese species B. grandis is hardy to USDA hardiness zone 6 and is commonly known as the [...] "hardy begonia". Most begonias can be grown outdoors year-round in subtropical or tropical climates, but in temperate climates, begonias are grown outdoors as annuals, or as house or greenhouse plants.|$|R
50|$|A stem tuber may {{form from}} {{thickened}} rhizomes or stolons. The tops or {{sides of the}} tuber produce shoots that grow into typical stems and leaves, and the undersides produce roots. Such tubers tend to form {{at the sides of}} the parent plant and are most often located near the soil surface. A below ground stem tuber is normally a short-lived storage and regenerative organ developing from a shoot that branches off a mature plant. The new tubers are attached to a parent tuber or form {{at the end of an}} underground rhizome. In the autumn the plant dies except for the new offspring stem tubers, which in spring regrow one or more new shoots producing stems and leaves. Some plants also form smaller tubers and/or tubercules, which act like seeds, producing small plants that resemble (in morphology and size) seedlings. Some stem tubers, such as those of <b>tuberous</b> <b>begonias,</b> are long lived, but many tuberous plants have tubers that survive only until the plants are in full leaf, at which point the tuber is reduced to a shrivelled up husk.|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} the design details {{and the performance}} analyses carried out with Eloumah 1, the solar drier of cassava tuberous roots reduced in granules and microchips. Eloumah 1 is composed by a solar collector, a drying chamber {{and a box of}} rectangular section that joins the two previous components. In this solar drier the wet agricultural products are dried {{on the basis of the}} heat flux buoyancy that is induced by the difference in temperature and humidity in its compartments. Analyses of masses evaporated water of zizila and Obama (TME 419) granules and microchips <b>tuberous</b> roots <b>varieties</b> have been carried out in order to estimate the drying performance of Eloumah 1 and to know the natural laws of the drying process. The results show that Eloumah 1 is able to dry granules and microchiphs and to reduce their moisture contain to less than 10 %. Moreover, it can be established that the drying process is a logistic process because in wet control samples, moisture contain has limited value. Therefore, the drying process cannot extract the free water beyond this limit value. The logistic function adjusts well these data based on the correlation coefficient (R 2) and chi square coefficient (? 2). Peer Revie...|$|R
