5|$|Stanton's {{position}} {{caused a}} significant rift <b>between</b> <b>herself</b> <b>and</b> many civil rights leaders, particularly Frederick Douglass, {{who believed that}} white women, already empowered by their connection to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. According to Douglass, their treatment as slaves entitled the now liberated African American men, who lacked women's indirect empowerment, to voting rights before women were granted the franchise. African American women, he believed, {{would have the same}} degree of empowerment as white women once African American men had the vote; hence, general female suffrage was, according to Douglass, of less concern than black male suffrage.|$|E
5|$|The 8th {{and early}} 9th centuries were also {{dominated}} by controversy and religious division over Iconoclasm, {{which was the}} main political issue in the Empire for over a century. Icons (here meaning all forms of religious imagery) were banned by Leo and Constantine from around 730, leading to revolts by iconodules (supporters of icons) throughout the empire. After the efforts of empress Irene, the Second Council of Nicaea met in 787 and affirmed that icons could be venerated but not worshiped. Irene {{is said to have}} endeavoured to negotiate a marriage <b>between</b> <b>herself</b> <b>and</b> Charlemagne, but, according to Theophanes the Confessor, the scheme was frustrated by Aetios, one of her favourites.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Fire Emblem games, Path of Radiance {{takes place in}} a continuity and setting separate {{from the rest of the}} series. The game's setting is the continent of Tellius, inhabited by two species: the humanoid Beorc, and the shape-shifting Laguz. According to legend, the goddess who made the world created Beorc in her image, and created the Laguz to fill the gap <b>between</b> <b>herself</b> <b>and</b> beasts. The two races have struggled to coexist, leading to racial tensions and conflict on both sides. By the events of Path of Radiance, Tellius is divided into seven nations which remain at peace. A key item in Tellius is Lehran's Medallion, the world's incarnation of the recurring Fire Emblem. It is a bronze medallion said to contain a dark deity who brought chaos to the world 800 years before and caused all the world but Tellius to be engulfed by the sea. To prevent the dark god being freed, war must be prevented in Tellius.|$|E

On the October 31 episode of SmackDown! at a Halloween party, Stephanie McMahon and Eric Bischoff shared a kiss while McMahon was dressed as a witch and Bischoff was disguised as her father underneath a mask. McMahon was given credit for the return of the WWE United States Championship and for the creation of the WWE Tag Team Championship. She was also credited with signing Hulk Hogan back to SmackDown!, which caused friction <b>between</b> <b>herself</b> <b>and</b> her father.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet {{approached}} the French line in an oblique manner, leading to individual engagements as the British ships attempted {{to break through}} at several points. Around 9:30, the British flagship HMS Queen Charlotte cut the French line aft of Montagne, firing a devastating raking broadside that killed Montagnes commander, Captain Bazire. The ship astern of Montagne, Jacobin, attempted to prevent Queen Charlotte breaking through by accelerating {{to close the gap}} <b>between</b> <b>herself</b> <b>and</b> her flagship; this left a gap behind her, between Jacobin and Achille, that HMS Brunswick, under Captain John Harvey, attempted to exploit to cut the line and assist Queen Charlotte. Achille accelerated and closed the gap, and Brunswick turned her fire against Vengeur, while Achille engaged HMS Ramillies and Valiant.|$|E

25|$|At 05:30 on 26 January, Tunny sighted masts and a stack {{over the}} horizon {{indicating}} a possible target. During the day, she lessened the distance <b>between</b> <b>herself</b> <b>and</b> her quarry; and, near dusk, she closed a 400-ton trawler. Finding the prey not worth a torpedo, the submarine surfaced and opened fire with her deck gun. Soon, darkness forced her to discontinue the attack, and she continued on her way.|$|E

25|$|Beloved and Sethe {{are both}} very much emotionally {{impaired}} {{as a result of}} Sethe’s previous enslavement. Slavery creates a situation where a mother is separated from her child, which has devastating consequences for both parties. Furthermore, the earliest need a child has is related to the mother: the baby needs milk from the mother. Sethe is traumatized by the experience of having her milk stolen because it means she cannot form the symbolic bond <b>between</b> <b>herself</b> <b>and</b> her daughter.|$|E
25|$|Lucy Bailey's 2012 RSC {{production}} at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, starring Lisa Dillon and David Caves, with Nick Holder as Sly.
