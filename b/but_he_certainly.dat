Wales assistant manager Roy Evans was present to watch Morison in Millwall's 1–0 victory against Swindon Town, while Morison [...] "registered his interest" [...] in representing Wales. In July 2010, Wales boss John Toshack named Morison in the Wales squad for a friendly against Luxembourg in Llanelli on 11 August 2010. On being called up to the Wales squad, Morison said [...] "It's a fantastic achievement and {{it feels good to}} be recognised for my hard work". Morison subsequently started in Wales' 5–1 victory against Luxembourg, playing the whole match and assisting Ashley Williams' goal. Following Morison's debut, manager John Toshack said [...] "I was very impressed with the debut of Steve Morison, he didn't get on the scoresheet, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> made his presence felt".|$|E

They added that Grampa is left behind, forgotten, and rarely invited to spend time with the family.

2500|$|Fleetwood-Smith's second tour of England in 1938 {{was less}} {{successful}} than his first. His 88 first-class wickets included match analyses of 8/70 against Somerset and 8/74 against Notts. Wisden {{noted that he}} succeeded mainly against batsmen unfamiliar with his method and offered this ambivalent assessment: [...] "He could not be written down as a failure <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> fell below expectations ..." [...] However, he played in every Test of the series for {{the only time in}} his career. His seven wickets in the fourth Test at Leeds gave crucial support to O'Reilly, whose 10/122 was the key factor in the victory that enabled Australia to retain The Ashes.|$|E
2500|$|He was baptised on 8 January 1787. His father, Thomas Drummond, was a {{gardener}} at Fotheringham estate. Little {{is known of}} his early life, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> followed the usual course of apprenticeship leading to his [...] "qualification" [...] as {{a gardener}}. In 1808, he was employed by Mr Dickson (most probably George Dickson of Leith Walk, Edinburgh). In the mid-1808, Drummond (aged 21) he was appointed curator of the botanic garden that was being established by the Cork Institution, {{in the city of}} Cork, Ireland. At the time this was a government funded garden, one purpose of which was the testing and propagation of plants {{for the benefit of the}} farmers of southern Ireland. In addition to his horticultural duties, Drummond discovered several species of plant that were previously not known to occur in Ireland. [...] In 1810 Drummond was elected an Associate of the Linnean Society of London. [...] That year he married Sarah Mackintosh, with whom he would have six children.|$|E
2500|$|Aboriginal woman Karina Lester and Chief Executive Craig Wilkins of the Conservation Council of South Australia raised {{concerns}} that the submission process was unnecessarily complicated as written submissions were required to be signed by a Justice of the Peace. Lester and Wilkins argued {{that this would be}} particularly difficult for members of regional and remote communities. Lester also pointed out that the language of the Commission's presentations and issues papers made them difficult for aboriginal people to comprehend. Lester drew attention to her father, Yami Lester, who lost his sight after exposure to radioactive fallout from British nuclear weapons tests at Maralinga and Emu Field in the 1950s and 1960s. She told the ABC: [...] "My father (lives) 27 kilometres west form Marla Bore, (he) doesn't drive, wouldn't have a JP on hand, and would probably need to travel down to Coober Pedy... <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> has a story to tell and certainly would love to have input into the Royal Commission."The Royal Commission responded by agreeing to accept oral submissions in addition to formal written submissions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{tour was}} a great {{disappointment}} for Australian cricket. The team won only nine of its 39 matches and were soundly beaten in the Test series, but the real difficulty was the indiscipline of some players. According to Wisden, quarrels began among the players during the opening match at Sheffield Park, Uckfield and Scott had [...] "neither the strength of character nor the experience as a leader that the difficulties of his position demanded". Scott and the team manager Ben Wardill {{spent a lot of}} time adjudicating quarrels and the stress of the captaincy impacted Scott's performances as a batsman. The 1887 edition of Wisden bemoaned the absence of Murdoch, saying: [...] "W. L. Murdoch, who was chief in the field of the three teams of 1880, 1882, and 1884, may not have exhibited all the qualities which go to make up that rare and valuable being, an ideal captain – <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> had a larger experience and a stronger will than the gentleman who, with the best of intentions, and the greatest sincerity of purpose, led the team of 1886".|$|E
2500|$|Here he, {{like many}} other writers, notes the {{elements}} of musical form (then often described as [...] "closed forms") which characterize the opera and make it appear {{to be something of}} a return to the language of earlier times, [...] "the veritable apotheosis of bel canto with its demands for vocal beauty, agility and range," [...] notes Charles Osborne. Thus, the cantabile-cabaletta two-part arias, the use of the chorus, etc., which Verdi had originally asked Cammarano to ignore, are evident. But Verdi wanted something else: [...] "the freer the forms he presents me with, the better I shall do," [...] he wrote to the librettist's friend in March 1851. It was not what he received from his librettist, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> demonstrated his total mastery over this style. Osborne's take on Il trovatore is that [...] "it is as though Verdi had decided to do something which he had been perfecting over the years, and to do it so beautifully that he need never to do it again. Formally, it is a step backward after Rigoletto".|$|E
2500|$|The bullying, however, {{almost got}} out of hand in mid-1875, when an {{editorial}} entitled [...] "Krieg-in-Sicht" [...] ("War in Sight") was published in a Berlin newspaper close to the government, the Post. The editorial indicated that highly influential Germans were alarmed by France's rapid recovery from defeat in 1875 and its announcement of an increase in the size of its army, as well as talks of launching a preventive war against France. Bismarck denied knowing about the article ahead of time, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> knew about the talk of preventive war. The editorial produced a war scare, with Britain and Russia warning that they would not tolerate a preventive war against France. Bismarck had no desire for war either, and the crisis soon blew over. It was a rare instance where Bismarck was outmaneuvered and embarrassed by his opponents, but from that he learned an important lesson. It forced him {{to take into account the}} fear and alarm that his bullying and Germany's fast-growing power was causing among its neighbors, and reinforced his determination that Germany should work in proactive fashion to preserve the peace in Europe, rather than passively let events take their own course and reacting to them.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, {{there were}} further {{performances}} of Ides works. [...] On June 13, 1978, {{there was a}} recital of his works to commemorate the centenary of his birth. [...] It was produced by the Center for Chamber Music, Inc., which was located at the Greenwich Country Day School. [...] It {{took place in the}} Cole Auditorium of the Greenwich Library, Greenwich, CT and gathered an audience of about 200, including the composer’s two daughters and Arthur Farwell’s son Brice Farwell, who said of Ide that “Dad might not always have agreed with his musical values, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> would have respected the workmanship”. [...] The performers at this recital were Benjamin DeLoach, a noted baritone, and John Kirkpatrick, pianist. [...] Kirkpatrick was a long-time friend of Ide’s and a well-known champion of 20th century American music, who has edited Ide’s Piano Sonata in A (1934) and some other works of his. [...] At the recital, he performed the sonata, which he also had premiered in 1934. [...] The works performed also included Ide’s Little Suite for Piano, and several songs, including a small cycle entitled “Three Poems of Robert Louis Stevenson”. [...] The performance was taped. [...] Kirkpatrick also included Ide’s works in other recitals in the late 1970s. [...] In 1983, Ide’s “Evening Solitude” and “Serenade” (arranged by John Kirkpatrick) were performed at Carnegie Hall. [...] The performers were Doriot Anthony Dwyer, flute, and Martin Amlin, piano. [...] In 1978 or 1980, the Greenwich Symphony Orchestra, with David Gilbert conducting, gave the world premiere of Ide’s Symphony in A. [...] A recording of the performance is available for download at the Unsung Composers website (see External Links section).|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from most music critics, {{based on an}} aggregate score of 68/100 from Metacritic. Allmusic writer David Jeffries gave it 3 out of 5 stars and viewed it as a [...] "porno-style album", stating [...] "Limited and a little patched together, but if cheap thrills are what you’re after, this one puts the dirty back in dirty south". The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin viewed its [...] "R heavy" [...] material as a weakness, but gave the album a B+ rating and praised Ludacris's lyricism, writing [...] "Ludacris remains an underrated lyricist with unparalleled verbal dexterity. His liquid flow crams {{an awful lot of}} polysyllabic words into even the tawdriest sex jam, and no rapper alive conveys joy as effortlessly or infectiously". Giving it 2½ out of 4 stars, Los Angeles Times critic August Brown called Battle of the Sexes [...] "another welcome occasion to listen to Luda enjoying the real love of his life -- the sound of his own voice", and described its music as [...] "fizzy pillow talk and respectfully tawdry club fodder". Despite viewing Ludacris's lyrics as from the male perspective, USA Todays Elysa Gardner commended him for his humor and wrote that the album is [...] "more appealing, and more artful, when Ludacris directs his crude, breezy rhymes where they're best suited: into unabashed displays of loopy lust and boneheaded bravado". XXL writer Rondell Conway gave Battle of the Sexes an XL rating and shared a similar sentiment, stating [...] "Luda may not have evened the playing field, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> created an excellent musical forum for the sexes to air out their differences". Newsdays Glenn Gamboa gave the album a B rating and commended Ludacris for his musical balance, writing [...] "Not only does Luda know when a song needs an R crooner or a female voice, he knows when he needs to speed up a flow or rough up a rhyme".|$|E
