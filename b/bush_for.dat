5|$|A keen geographer, Towner {{would often}} {{disappear}} into the <b>bush</b> <b>for</b> weeks on end, for study or exploration. As {{a fellow of the}} Royal Geographical Society of Australia and member of the Royal Historical Society of New South Wales, he took a particular interest in researching the life of the explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell. In 1946, he successfully lobbied the Australian Government to issue a postage stamp commemorating the centenary of Mitchell's discoveries in central Queensland. He addressed the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia in Brisbane in 1955, and was awarded the Dr Thomson Foundation Gold Medal for his geographical work the following year. Towner's address was published in 1957, in a booklet entitled Lake Eyre and its Tributaries.|$|E

5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked <b>Bush</b> <b>for</b> having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of the}} Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{played a}} {{critical}} role in persuading the United States government to undertake a crash program to create an atomic bomb. When the NDRC was formed, the Committee on Uranium was placed under it, reporting directly to Bush as the Uranium Committee. Bush reorganized the committee, strengthening its scientific component by adding Tuve, George B. Pegram, Jesse W. Beams, Ross Gunn and Harold Urey. When the OSRD was formed in June 1941, the Uranium Committee was again placed directly under <b>Bush.</b> <b>For</b> security reasons, its name was changed to the S-1 Section.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Willis and then-wife Demi Moore {{campaigned for}} Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis's Presidential bid. Four years later, he {{supported}} President George H. W. <b>Bush</b> <b>for</b> reelection {{and was an}} outspoken critic of Bill Clinton. However, in 1996, he declined to endorse Clinton's Republican opponent Bob Dole, because Dole had criticized Demi Moore for her role in the film Striptease. Willis was an invited speaker at the 2000 Republican National Convention, and supported George W. Bush that year. He did not make any contributions or public endorsements in the 2008 presidential campaign. In several June 2007 interviews, he declared that he maintains some Republican ideologies.|$|E

5|$|In the 2004 U.S. presidential {{election}} campaign, McCain {{was once again}} frequently mentioned for the vice-presidential slot, only this time {{as part of the}} Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry. McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain supported <b>Bush</b> <b>for</b> re-election, praising Bush's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks. At the same time, he defended Kerry's Vietnam War record. By August 2004, McCain had the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55percent to 19percent) of any national politician; he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously, though the two remained situational allies rather than friends.|$|E

On November 7, 2008, the Department of the Army announced the revocation of Versace's Silver Star because it was upgraded to the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|What {{became known}} as the King's Highway were a series of foot paths which the Mohawk had long used to get from west in the valley through the Pine Bush to trade with other tribes at the {{confluence}} of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers. This area was later the site of the Dutch Fort Orange. After the founding of Schenectady, the name was used for what became a major route between the two settlements but, until the mid-18th century, it was not improved beyond a foot path. During the war from 1699 to 1707, Albany residents collected firewood from the Pine <b>Bush</b> <b>for</b> the large army that was camped at Fort Frederick.|$|E

5|$|Ted Serong {{was born}} in the suburb of Abbotsford in Melbourne on 11 November 1915, the first child of William and Mabel Serong. His father was of Portuguese {{heritage}} from the island of Madeira; the family had first settled in Australia in 1824. An apprentice blacksmith, William had served in the Citizens Military Force (CMF) and later the First Australian Imperial Force (1st AIF) in France during the First World War, before specializing in the maintenance of weapons and engineering stores, and working for the Department of Defence as a quality control engineer. Serong's younger brother, Raymond, {{was born in}} 1917. William believed in physical fitness and discipline, and he taught both of his sons to box, as well as to scout, shoot rabbits, and live off the land. Between 1930 and 1932, during the Great Depression, the boys lived in the <b>bush</b> <b>for</b> extended periods, relying on their hunting skills to survive.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{began their}} second drive {{of the quarter}} at their own 25-yard line. In fits and starts, the Louisville offense {{advanced}} down the field. Kolby Smith ran for a yard, Michael <b>Bush</b> <b>for</b> two, then six yards, and Cantwell completed two passes of seven yards each. The Cardinals were also helped by a defensive pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech, which gave Louisville a first down by penalty. As Louisville began to enter Tech territory in earnest, however, the Cardinals suffered their first turnover of the game. Facing third down and three yards from the Virginia Tech 40-yard line, Cantwell was sacked and fumbled the ball. Tech defender Xavier Adibi scooped up the loose ball, and Tech gained the initiative. Following the fumble, the Hokies began a drive at their 47-yard line. On the first play, Tech was aided by a pass interference penalty on Louisville. The penalty {{was followed by a}} three-yard Cedric Humes rush and yet another pass interference penalty against Louisville. Humes rushed twice more for five yards, and Vick completed a 16-yard pass to David Clowney before Vick completed a five-yard touchdown pass to Jeff King. The score and subsequent extra point gave Virginia Tech a 28–24 lead—its first of the game—with 6:03 remaining.|$|E
5|$|The party's {{views on}} the United States and the Middle East have evolved over time. Despite the anti-American views of some right-wing forums in the 1970s and 1980s (that chiefly were rooted in worries over US {{cultural}} expansion and hegemonic role in world politics {{at the expense of}} Europe), the FPÖ were more positively inclined towards the United States under Haider's leadership in the late 1980s and 1990s. However, this changed in 2003 following Haider visiting Saddam Hussein {{on the eve of the}} Iraq War; he subsequently condemned US foreign policy and derided George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>for</b> not being very different from Hussein. This move was strongly criticised by the FPÖ, which was part of the then-current government. Nevertheless, in the mid- to late 2000s the FPÖ too criticised US foreign policy as promoted by Bush, which it saw as leading to increased levels of violence in the Middle East. The party also became more critical of Israel's part in the Israel-Palestine conflict.|$|E

On September 1, Gore was contacted by Charity Hospital's Neurosurgeon Dr. David Kline, who had operated on his son Albert, through Greg Simon of FasterCures. Kline informed Gore and Simon of the desperate conditions {{at the hospital and}} asked Gore and Simon to arrange relief. On Gore's personal financial commitment, two airlines each provided a plane with one flight latter underwritten by Larry Flax. The flights were flown by volunteer airline crews and medically staffed by Gore's cousin, retired Col. Dar LaFon, and family physician Dr. Anderson Spickard and were accompanied by Gore and Albert III. Gore used his political influence to expedite landing rights in New Orleans.|$|E
