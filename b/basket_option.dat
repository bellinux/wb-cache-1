More precisely, <b>basket</b> <b>option</b> prices {{are determined by}} replacing the real basket with an appropriate approximation. For the approximate basket we determine the underlying characteristic function and hence we can derive the related <b>basket</b> <b>option</b> prices by using the Carr-Madan formula. Two approaches are considered. In the first approach, we replace the arithmetic sum by an appropriate geometric sum, whereas the second approach {{can be considered as}} a three-moments-matching method. Numerical examples illustrate the accuracy of our approximations; several L´evy models are calibrated to market data and <b>basket</b> <b>option</b> prices are determined. In a last part we show how our newly designed <b>basket</b> <b>option</b> pricing formula can be used to define implied L´evy correlation by matching model and market prices for basket options. Our main finding is that the implied L´evy correlation smile is flatter than its Gaussian counterpart. Furthermore, if (near) at-the-money option prices are used, the corresponding implied Gaussian correlation estimate is a good proxy for the implied L´evy correlation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 70 - 71). The celebrated Black-Scholes {{option pricing}} model {{is unable to}} produce closed-form solutions for arithmetic <b>basket</b> <b>options.</b> This problem stems {{from the lack of}} an analitical form for the distribution of a sum of lognormal random variables. lVlarket participants commonly price <b>basket</b> <b>options</b> by assuming the basket follows lognormal dynamics, although it is known that this approximation performs poorly in some cicumstances. The problem of finding an analytical approximation to the sum of lognormally distributed random variables has been widely studied. In this dissertation we seek to draw these studies together and apply them in an option pricing setting. We propose some new option pricing formulae based on these approximations. In order to examine the utility of these new formulae and compare them to commonly used market approximations we present rigorous analytical bounds for the price of arithmetic <b>basket</b> <b>options</b> using the theory of comonotonicity. In this we follow the ideas in Deelstra et al. [7]. Additionally we provide an interval of hedge parameters (the Greeks).

40|$|Background: In an {{increasingly}} globalized environment, corporations perform transactions across borders {{on a day-to-day}} basis. As multinational corporations expand their businesses the number of currencies in their operations increases. The consequence of operating with several currencies is the risk associated with currency fluctuations. Sandvik AB is a worldwide corporation where activities are conducted through representation in more than 130 countries. Currency exposures are controlled through risk management where financial derivatives are applied to protect the corporation from potential losses caused by fluctuations. Sandvik AB recently implemented a hedging strategy entitled Layered <b>Basket</b> <b>Option</b> hedging. The strategy {{is a combination of}} a layered- and a <b>basket</b> <b>option</b> approach to maximize the effect of the hedge. There is a limited amount of previous research regarding Layered <b>Basket</b> <b>Option</b> hedging and Sandvik AB is the first corporation to actively practice this strategy. Purpose: The purpose is to investigate and provide information about how currency risk most effectively is hedged for the multinational corporation Sandvik AB. Furthermore, we want to evaluate if Sandvik’s recently implemented hedging strategy, Layered <b>Basket</b> <b>Option</b> hedging, is the best-suited strategy for them and if there are any improvements to be made. This thesis will further investigate the importance of currency hedging for multinational corporations, which are dependent on reporting to their stakeholders. Hopefully, this thesis will also facilitate the communication of Sandvik’s currency strategies throughout the organization and make it more comprehensible. Method: Exchange rates on daily basis for the period 2002 - 2012 were collected from Bank of Canada and Reuters database. The collected data was thereafter used as a basis to perform calculations to determine if Layered <b>Basket</b> <b>Option</b> hedging is the optimal solution for Sandvik AB. Conclusion: The results of this study highlight the benefits from applying a Layered <b>Basket</b> <b>Option</b> hedging strategy and the strategy succeeds to reduce the volatility caused by currency fluctuation. The results indicate that the combination of a layered- and a <b>basket</b> <b>option</b> approach successfully creates a suitable strategy for Sandvik AB. Furthermore, this thesis has recognized that there exists room for improvement by actively allocating currencies according to their weights and correlations to fully exploit the effects from the strategy...|$|E

[The concept of comonotonicity in actuarial science and finance: theory, Insurance Math. Econom. 31 (1) (2002) 3 – 33]. We generalize the methods in Deelstra et al.

[Bounds for the price of discrete sampled arithmetic Asian options, J. Comput. Appl. Math. 185 (1) (2006) 51 – 90]. Afterwards we show how to derive an analytical closed-form expression for a lower bound in the non-comonotonic case. Finally, we derive upper bounds for Asian <b>basket</b> <b>options</b> by applying techniques as in Thompson [Fast narrow bounds on the value of Asian options, Working Paper, University of Cambridge, 1999] and Lord [Partially exact and bounded approximations for arithmetic Asian options, J.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} pricing American basket options in a multivariate setting, which includes among others, the Bachelier and the Black-Scholes models. In high dimensions, nonlinear partial differential equation methods for solving the problem become prohibitively costly due to the curse of dimensionality. Instead, this work proposes to use a stopping rule {{that depends on the}} dynamics of a low-dimensional Markovian projection of the given basket of assets. It is shown that the ability to approximate the original value function by a lower-dimensional approximation is a feature of the dynamics of the system and is unaffected by the path-dependent nature of the American <b>basket</b> <b>option.</b> Assuming that we know the density of the forward process and using the Laplace approximation, we first efficiently evaluate the diffusion coefficient corresponding to the low-dimensional Markovian projection of the basket. Then, we approximate the optimal early-exercise boundary of the option by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation in the projected, low-dimensional space. The resulting near-optimal early-exercise boundary is used to produce an exercise strategy for the high-dimensional option, thereby providing a lower bound for the price of the American <b>basket</b> <b>option.</b> A corresponding upper bound is also provided. These bounds allow to assess the accuracy of the proposed pricing method. Indeed, our approximate early-exercise strategy provides a straightforward lower bound for the American <b>basket</b> <b>option</b> price. Following a duality argument due to Rogers, we derive a corresponding upper bound solving only the low-dimensional optimal control problem. Numerically, we show the feasibility of the method using baskets with dimensions up to fifty. In these examples, the resulting option price relative errors are only of the order of few percent...|$|E
