40|$|The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 {{mandates}} that the Fully Burdened Cost of Fuel, including {{the total cost}} of procuring and transporting fuel, infrastructure operating costs, and the cost of force protection for the logistics tail, be applied in trade-off analyses for all Defense systems that create a demand for energy. Using data from the Defense Logistics Agency Energy, this thesis builds a model of its worldwide supply chain for <b>bulk</b> <b>fuels,</b> and uses the principles of input-output analysis to calculate the total cost to deliver three fuel types to each destination in the supply chain. Although the Defense Logistics Agency Energy charges a standard price to each service for <b>bulk</b> <b>fuels,</b> these results show that they incur very different costs, ranging from less than a penny per gallon to over 70 cents per gallon, to deliver to different locations. Given the appropriate data on services' fuel distribution networks, a Defense-wide extension of the <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fuels</b> Distribution Model could be used to replace the current seven-step Fully Burdened Cost of Fuel process with a single step, allowing for less complex and more accurate Fully Burdened Cost of Fuel calculations.
