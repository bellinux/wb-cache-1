These latter led to fluorinated azido and diazido intermediates, which were reduced, into the fluorinated amine and diamine in two steps.

These compounds are formed by reacting the polyol component with an isocyanate compound, typically toluene diisocyanate (TDI); methylene diisocyanate (MDI) and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) are also widely used.

5000|$|Polymer {{degradation}} by {{galvanic action}} was first {{described in the}} technical literature in 1990. This was the discovery that [...] "plastics can corrode", i.e. polymer degradation may occur through galvanic action {{similar to that of}} metals under certain conditions and has been referred to as the [...] "Faudree Effect". In the aerospace field, this finding has largely contributed to aircraft safety, mainly those aircraft that use CFRP and has resulted in a wide body of follow-up research and patents. Normally, when two dissimilar metals such as copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) are put into contact and then immersed in salt water, the iron will undergo corrosion, or rust. This is called a galvanic circuit where the copper is the noble metal and the iron is the active metal, i.e., the copper is the positive (+) electrode and the iron is the negative (-) electrode. A battery is formed. It follows that plastics are made stronger by impregnating them with thin carbon fibers only a few micrometers in diameter known as carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). This is to produce materials that are high strength and resistant to high temperatures. The carbon fibers act as a noble metal similar to gold (Au) or platinum (Pt). When put into contact with a more active metal, for example with aluminum (Al) in salt water the aluminum corrodes. However, in early 1990, it was reported that imide-linked resins in CFRP composites degrade when bare composite is coupled with an active metal in salt water environments. This is because corrosion not only occurs at the aluminum anode, but also at the carbon fiber cathode {{in the form of a}} very strong base with a pH of about 13. This strong base reacts with the polymer chain structure degrading the polymer. Polymers affected include <b>bismaleimides</b> (BMI), condensation polyimides, triazines, and blends thereof. Degradation occurs in the form of dissolved resin and loose fibers. The hydroxyl ions generated at the graphite cathode attack the O-C-N bond in the polyimide structure. Standard corrosion protection procedures were found to prevent polymer degradation under most conditions.|$|E
