40|$|BACKGROUND—A factory fire in Tranmere, Merseyside, England, {{deposited}} asbestos containing fallout in {{an urban}} area. There was considerable community anxiety for months after the incident. Therefore {{an assessment of the}} long term health risks of this acute environmental incident were requested by the local health authority.  METHODS—The facts of the incident were gathered and appraised from unpublished and press reports, involved personnel, and further analysis of material collected {{at the time of the}} incident. The literature on the long term health risks of asbestos was reviewed, and combined with evidence on asbestos exposure to estimate community health risk.  RESULTS—Risk was almost entirely from exposure to fire fallout of chrysotile in asbestos <b>bitumen</b> <b>paper</b> covering the factory roof. Amosite was only detected in a few samples and in trace amounts. The number of people who lived in the area of fallout was 16   000 to 48   000. From a non-threshold model with assumptions likely to overestimate risk, the lung cancer risk is estimated to be undetectably small. Risk of mesothelioma from chrysotile exposure, and risks of lung cancer and mesothelioma from amosite exposure were based on observational studies and were estimated to be even lower than that of lung cancer risk from chrysotile exposure. Academically, there are assumptions that while reasonable cannot be proven, for example, the validity of extrapolating observed risk from much higher exposures to lower exposures, estimates of individual exposure, and that there is no threshold for asbestos to cause cancer.  CONCLUSIONS—The author is unaware of a similar study on long term health risks in a community exposed to asbestos in a fire. It is concluded that, using methods that do not underestimate risk, risk is undetectably small. Practical lessons from this methodology and approach to health risk assessment are discussed.    Keywords: asbestos; environmental pollutants; mesothelioma; health risk assessment; lung cance...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{variables}} {{that affect the}} viscoelastic properties of asphalt mixtures with time, among which age hardening may be {{considered one of the}} important ones. Age hardening of asphalt mixtures is an irreversible process, which contributes to a reduction of the durability of pavements and eventually increases the maintenance cost. Beside the environmental effects, ageing in asphalt mixture depends on the physicochemical properties of bitumen and mixture morphology which is a combined effect of aggregate packing, porosity, air void distribution and their interconnectivity. Thus, a clear understanding on the physicochemical properties of bitumen and mixture morphology may help to predict the performance of asphalt mixtures, which will contribute to longer-lasting and better performing pavements. When looking at the bitumen at micro-scale, one can see microstructures appearing under certain conditions which can be partially explained by the interaction of the individual phases. Since the thermo-rheological behavior of bitumen depends largely on its chemical structure and intermolecular microstructures, studying these can lead to understanding of the mechanism, speed and conditions under which this phase behavior occurs. Linking this to the changes in properties of bitumen can thus lead to better understanding of the causes of ageing, its dominant parameters and the resulting diminished mechanical response. To investigate ageing in asphalt pavements, along with physicochemical properties of bitumen one needs to also focus on the influence of mixture morphology.   It is known that asphalt mixtures with similar percentages of air-voids can have different morphologies and thus can age differently. Prediction of ageing behavior without considering the influence of mixture morphology may thus lead to erroneous conclusions and non-optimal mix design. Hence, {{it is important to understand}} the interplay between the mixture morphology and ageing susceptibility and relate this to the long term mixture performance. The aim of this Thesis was to develop fundamental understanding on ageing in asphalt mixtures that can contribute to the asphalt community moving away from the currently used accelerated ageing laboratory tests and empirical models that can lead to erroneous conclusions. To reach this aim, experimental and numerical micro-scale analyses on bitumen and meso-scale investigations on mixture morphology have been performed which, collectively, allowed for the development of a method for the prediction of asphalt field ageing, incorporating both mixture morphology and micro-scale bitumen mechanisms. For this, first, the mechanisms of surface ageing and diffusion controlled oxidative ageing were identified. Secondly, the influence of mixture morphology on asphalt ageing susceptibility was investigated. Procedures to determine the controlling parameter were then developed and an empirical framework to quantify the long-term field ageing of asphalt mixtures was set-up. For this, a combination of experimental and numerical methods was employed. An extensive experimental study was carried out to understand the fundamental mechanisms behind the micro-structural phase appearance and the speed or mobility at which they change. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was utilized at different temperatures to investigate the phase separation behavior for four different types of bitumen and co-relate it with the Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements. Based on the experimental findings, it was concluded that the observed phase separation is mainly due to the wax/paraffin fraction presence in <b>bitumen</b> (<b>Paper</b> I). A hypothesis was developed of the appearance of a thin film at the specimen surface due to ageing which is creating a barrier, restricting thus the microstructures to float towards the surface. Furthermore, investigation showed that depending on the bitumen and exposure types this surface thin film is water soluble and thus the moisture damage becomes more severe with the ageing of asphalt pavement (Paper II and IV). A new empirical relation to obtain the primary structure coating thickness was established utilizing mixture volumetric properties and gradation using a large set of data from different literature sources. It was found that the enhanced morphological framework can be used to optimize the long term performance of asphalt mixtures (Paper III).   Thereafter, the effect of diffusion controlled oxidative ageing on different mixture morphologies based on oxidative ageing mechanism of bitumen and diffusion-reaction process was investigated using the Finite Element Method (FEM). From the FE analyses, the effect of air-void distribution and their interconnectivity combined with the aggregate packing was shown to have a significant effect on age hardening (Paper IV). It was shown that focusing only on the percentage of air-void as the main predictive ageing parameter may lead to an erroneous conclusion and non-optimal predictions of long-term behavior.   To replace such approaches, a new way to predict the long-term ageing was proposed in this Thesis, utilizing the found influences of mixture morphology and fundamental mechanism. Though additional mechanisms and non-linear coupling between them may be still needed to reach the ‘ultimate’ ageing prediction model, the current model was found to be a significant improvement to the currently used methods and may lead the way towards further enhancing the fundamental knowledge towards asphalt mixture ageing (Paper V).

40|$|Crumb rubber {{modification}} {{has been}} proven to enhance the properties of pure <b>bitumen.</b> This <b>paper</b> looks {{at some of the}} international standards for producing crumb rubber modified bitumen (CRMB) and reviews the effect of crumb rubber to the rheology of crumb rubber modified bitumen. The review shows that the rheology of CRMB depends on internal factors such as crumb rubber quantity, particle size, and pure bitumen composition, and external factors such as the mixing time, temperature, and also the modification technique. These factors govern the swelling process of crumb rubber particles that lead to the increase of viscosity of the modified bitumen. However, the mixing temperature and duration can cause rubber particles to depolymerize and subsequently cause loss of viscosity. Crumb rubber modification also improves the properties of bitumen by increasing the storage and loss modulus and enhancing the high and low temperature susceptibility. The effect of crumb rubber to aging properties of CRMB is also discussed. Finally several techniques of chemical modification to terminal blends of CRMB and the subsequent improvement to the settling property of CRMB are explained...|$|R

The model includes realistic chemical constituents and introduces a coarse-graining level that suppresses the highest frequency modes. Molecular dynamics simulations {{of the model}} are being carried out using Graphic-Processor-Units based software in time spans in order of microseconds, and this enables the study of slow relaxation processes characterizing <b>bitumen.</b> This <b>paper</b> focuses on the high-temperature dynamics as expressed through the mean-square displacement, the stress autocorrelation function, and rotational relaxation. The diffusivity of the individual molecules changes little {{as a function of}} temperature and reveals distinct dynamical time scales {{as a result of the}} different constituents in the system. Different time scales are also observed for the rotational relaxation. The stress autocorrelation function features a slow non-exponential decay for all temperatures studied. From the stress autocorrelation function, the shear viscosity and shear modulus are evaluated at the highest temperature, showing a viscous response at frequencies below 100 MHz. The model predictions of viscosity and diffusivities are compared to experimental data, giving reasonable agreement. The model shows that the asphaltene, resin and resinous oil tend to form nano-aggregates. The characteristic dynamical relaxation time of these aggregates is different from the homogeneously distributed parts of the system, leading to strong dynamical heterogeneity.

Un-milled GBS is widely used in France for stabilising gravels and sands and this stabilisation method {{is referred to as}} Grave-Laitier (GL) meaning gravel-slag. If sand is stabilised it is called Sable Laitier (sand-slag). In this process the GBS is mixed with the gravel or sand in a mixing installation (much like a concrete mixer). Because GBS will not hydrate in its own, but needs to be activated, lime and gypsum are added during the mixing process. Because un-milled slag has a gradation like sand and is used in relatively high percentages as a stabiliser (10 to 20 %), the GBS not only provides chemical, but also a mechanical stabilisation. This stabilisation method has a number of advantages over conventional stabilisation using Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) or <b>bitumen.</b> This <b>paper</b> was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.

ABSTRACT: Ultraviolet (UV) and thermal aging are two quite different types of aging. This study experimentally compares UV aging with thermal aging of several bituminous binders. Bitumen was evaluated with respect to its changes in physical and rheological properties. The results show that bitumen has different sensitivities to UV and thermal radiation. Penetration values, softening point and ductility of UV-aged bitumen {{are not the same}} as those in thermally aged bitumen. Rheological indices also reveal that UV aging and thermal aging have different influences on bitumen. The low-temperature property degraded remarkably due to UV aging. This paper also explains the mechanism of aging behaviour using infrared spectroscopy and chemical component investigation, and points out that aromatics and resins are the crucial chemical components for the anti-UV aging ability of <b>bitumen.</b> This <b>paper</b> was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.

However, according to Latvian Road Specifications dolomite and gravel cannot be used for average and high intensity roads because of its low quality (mainly, LA index). Therefore, mostly imported magmatic rocks (granite, diabase, gabbro, basalt) or imported dolomite are usedwhich makes asphalt expensive. Hence there is a need to adapt High ModulusAsphalt Concrete (HMAC) technical solutions which allow application of local materials in long-life road pavements. The aim of the research is to develop a high performance asphalt concrete for base and binder courses using only locally available aggregates. The design of the asphalt includes a combination of empirical and performance based tests. Stiffness, resistance to rutting, fatigue and thermal cracking tests were carried out.

Conversely, little rutting was observed in the three sections stabilised with foamed bitumen and 1. 0 % cement, showing that cement and FB together significantly improve pavement performance. The rutting results were used to develop models to describe the stable and unstable performance of the tested pavements.

40|$|Abstract. Water {{damage of}} asphalt {{concrete}} pavements {{has been one}} of the major distresses in highway engineering. Engineering experiences and research results indicate that this damage is due to the extortionate air voids of bitumen mixtures. Paranormal porosity of asphalt mixture is largely the result of the poor controlling of compact degree during paving process. The quality of asphalt pavement is subjected to the controlling methods of compacting of bitumen mixtures. Ultrasonic is an excellent method for non-destructive testing used in various engineering fields. It is also a potentially effective tool to be applied in the control and evaluation of the compaction quality of <b>bitumen</b> mixtures. This <b>paper</b> presents the results of a study aimed at the applicability of ultrasonic technology for evaluation of porosity and compaction quality of bitumen mixtures. It is shown that this technology, which has been successfully used for many years for evaluation of Portland concrete structures, might be used in asphalt pavement engineering to provide a simple, quick, and objective methodology for control and evaluation of the compact quality of bitumen mixtures. The results of laboratory testing demonstrate the potential of this technology...|$|R
40|$|The strong {{demand for}} {{environmental}} sustainable techniques in road pavements has increased {{during the years}} due to environmentally-friendly worldwide policies of the major industrialized countries. One of the consequences is the adoption of cold, in place recycling and bitumen stabilization as two of the preferred technologies for addressing rehabilitation by reusing material of existing pavements. Stabilization with bitumen enhances the performances of subgrade, providing durability equal or exceeding that achievable through virgin materials, even at lower costs.

40|$|International audienceIt is {{well-known}} that asphaltene content {{plays an important}} role in determining the high viscosity of <b>bitumen.</b> This <b>paper</b> presents an experimental study of the specific effects of extrusion operating conditions on the physical and chemical properties of bitumen. Five bitumen samples were prepared by twin screw extrusion with different operating conditions (feed rate Q and screw speed N). Physical properties were studied by rheological measurements. Viscosity values were measured by steady state flow tests. Chemical changes in the bitumen structure were followed in the infrared region with attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy by measuring the evolution of the bands areas at 1700 cm- 1 (C=O), 1030 cm- 1 (S=O), and 1600 cm- 1 (aromatic C=C) and the bands between 900 and 730 cm- 1 attributed to aromatic C-H. An increase in feed rate Q induces a decrease in the Newtonian viscosity, as a result of a decrease in the asphaltene volume fraction. The characterization by ATR confirms that the decrease in feed rate entails the creation of C=O functional groups and the increase in sulfoxide (S=O) functional groups and C=C bonds, accompanied by a decrease in the C-H aromatic bonds. These results indicate a structure that is more oxidized and more aggregated at low feed rate, certainly as the result of an increase in the residence time into the extruder. The increase in screw speed also induces decreases in the viscosity and the volume fraction of asphaltenes, until a point after which the situation reverses. This change may be explained by the appearance of new peaks between 1200 and 1050 cm- 1, attributed to C=S bonds, and between 640 and 540 cm- 1, for S-S bonds. A competition between shear rate and residence time takes place. The thermomechanical history has, thus, a great influence on the chemical and rheological behavior of pure bitumen, and the chemical changes observed show that the asphaltene volume fraction is not the unique parameter that explains the variations in viscosity...|$|R

The volumetric analysis of asphalt mixtures mainly makes use of standard laboratory design tests. The Belgian Road Research Centre has developed an analytical computer programme (PRADO) that assists in desktop volumetric design. The University of Stellenbosch in co-operation with MUCH Asphalt has undertaken desktop volumetric analysis using PRADO on two asphalt mixes, a wearing course mix and an asphalt base mix. The analysis focussed on the determination of an optimal grading and optimal composition of the several aggregate fractions available. It was also used to predict volumetric properties such as voids in mineral aggregate (VMA), voids in mix (VIM) and voids filled with <b>bitumen</b> (VFB). This <b>paper</b> presents the results of these analyses and compares the predicted values with the actual volumetric properties as determined in standard laboratory design tests.

40|$|With the aim to {{understand}} the effect of thermal condition on phase separation in polymer-modified <b>bitumen</b> (PMB), this <b>paper</b> numerically investigates four PMB binders under five thermal conditions between 140 and 180  °C. Based on a phase-field model previously developed by the authors for PMB phase separation, the updated model {{presented in this paper}} uses temperature-dependent parameters in order to approach the concerned temperature range, including mobility coefficients, interaction and dilution parameters. The model is implemented in a finite element software package and calibrated with the experimental observations of the four PMBs. The experimental results are well reproduced by the model, and it is thus believed that the calibrated parameters can represent the four PMBs. The simulation results indicate that the model proposed in this paper is capable of capturing the stability differences among the four PMBs and their distinct microstructures at different temperatures. Due to the transition of some PMBs from the thermodynamically stable state at 180  °C to the unstable state at 140  °C, a homogenization process may occur during the cooling applied numerically. After the transition, the PMBs start to separate into two phases and gradually form the binary structures controlled by the temperature. It is indicated that the cooling rate slightly affects the final pattern of the PMB binary microstructure, although the process can be more complicated in reality due to the potential dynamic reasons.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{worldwide}} trend to link the success of pavement rehabilitation directly with the ride quality, or perceived ride comfort, of the resultant pavement. Both the rehabilitation technique employed and the materials used have the potential to influence the final ride quality achieved. Due to the limited availability of good quality materials and the increasing cost of hot mixed asphalt mixtures, cold in-place recycling (CIPR) is proving to be an attractive alternative for rehabilitating <b>bitumen</b> pavements. This <b>paper</b> deals with the use of CIPR with foamed bitumen for rehabilitating pavements (a treatment that over recent years has experienced a sharp increase in its use) and the effect it has on the ride quality of the rehabilitated pavement. Most CIPR-related research studies have tended to focus on material characterisation and mix designs performed in the laboratory, and/or an analysis of structural aspects of the pavement. The use of CIPR with foamed bitumen stabilisation has also been limited mostly to roads with low or medium traffic volume. Because of the lack of information available relating to the ride quality of pavements rehabilitated using this technique, the Greek Ministry for Public Works undertook a field study of a severely damaged section of a heavily trafficked highway pavement, part of the Trans European Network, which was rehabilitated using CIPR with foamed bitumen. To assess the effect on the ride quality of the pavement, roughness data were collected on an 'as built' basis prior to, during, and after the CIPR rehabilitation process. The pavement roughness was evaluated by measuring the international roughness index (IRI) values and, in addition, by calculating a series of power spectral density (PSD) functions in order to reveal the dominant wavelengths contained within the pavement surface. The results were used to assess the effectiveness of the CIPR with foamed bitumen treatment technique on the ride quality of the pavement. PSD analysis provides profound information concerning the amplitudes of surface wavelengths. Such information concerns the increase of the medium and long wavelength roughness of the CIPR layer surface, which seems to be crucial for ride quality...|$|R
40|$|Bitumen is {{a complex}} product with a large matrix of heavy aliphatic/naphthenic/aromatic {{hydrocarbons}} {{as well as a}} large number of isomeric compounds such as polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs). Some PACs and derivatives are known to have a mutagenic and carcinogenic activity, and there is no generally satisfactory clean-up method for separating PACs from this very complex hydrocarbon matrix. Moreover, from an analytical point of view, the isomeric compounds usually co-elute in the same gas chromatography (GC) retention range, GC being {{one of the most widely}} used techniques in this area. However, the use of a suitable clean-up procedure for isolating the aromatic fractions, combined with two selective detection techniques such as mass spectrometry (GC-Ion Trap MS) and HPLC-Fluorescent detector (HPLC-FL), is expected to provide an effective tool for accurately determining certain PAC species in <b>bitumen.</b> In this <b>paper</b> we compare two quantitative extractions to analyse the 16 PAHs that occur in bitumen according to the US EPA reference list. Two clean-up protocols are assessed and compared by using both GC-Ion Trap MS and HPLC-FL chromatographic/detection techniques. The first extraction method combines well-established and proven clean-up operations with an automatic fractionation by semi-preparative HPLC (certification test program for PAHs in sewage sludge, in creosote-contaminated soil and in harbour sediment organised by the Community Bureau of Reference, BCR). The second method uses a multiple step-by-step liquid/liquid and liquid/solid extraction clean-up procedure. After the bitumen extracts are cleaned up, only the use of both GC-MS & HPLC-FL can provide reliable results. The more sensitive FL provides enhanced fluorescent selectivity signals that facilitate identification of PAH compounds. However, for their quantification, the capillary GC-ion trap mass spectrometric technique is preferred because of the insufficient resolution of the HPLC column and the possible quenching or co-elution effect of matrix compounds. Both detection techniques are regarded as complementary.
