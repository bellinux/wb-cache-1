40|$|Salmonids, {{outside their}} {{reproductive}} period, {{are seen to}} have two types of territory called "territorial mosaic" and "partial territory". The first aspect of this research aimed at identifying the type of territory established by mature <b>brook</b> <b>chars</b> in artificial streams. After this, the biological value of spacing out was studied with regard to two resources: food, and shelter/shade which gives protection. Three 5 X 1 X 1 m artificial streams were built {{on the edge of}} a natural brook which provided a continuous water supply. One hundred and fifty mature <b>brook</b> <b>chars</b> (Salvelinus fontinalis) taken from that brook were distributed into 30 colonies with 5 members apiece. Three experimental conditions were created, and 10 colonies were submitted to each of these. In the first experimental condition, the quality of shelter/shade differed in 3 sectors of the artificial streams, whereas the quantity of food remained the same for all 3. In the second experimental condition, the quality of shelter/shade was identical, while the quantity of food differed in the 3 sectors. In the last condition, conflict was created: the fish had to choose between an area which offered excellent shelter/shade but no food, one which provided ample nourishment but no shelter/shade, and one in which all those resources were present at intermediate levels. Observation of the 30 colonies revealed "partial territory" in all cases. These corresponded to more or less complete aggressive-dominance hierarchies. Almost every alpha established territory, and the number of territorial individuals progressively decreased throughout inferior ranks. Alphas had exclusive use of their territory. Lower-ranking individuals successfully defended their territory against their subordinates, but were unable to drive away higher-ranking conspecifics. Overall results also indicated that the highest-ranking <b>brook</b> <b>chars</b> in the aggressive-dominance hierarchies more frequently established their territories in sectors of the streams with good shelter/shade than in sectors with good alimentary conditions...|$|R

50|$|This species lives only {{in eastern}} {{waterways}} of Otago, in wetlands and small streams that {{flow into the}} Taieri, Tokomairiro and Waipori rivers and below Lake Mahinerangi. These streams tend to be shallow, fast flowing and stony, ranging from lowland forested areas to alpine. G. eldoni lives among the gravels or under {{the banks of the}} waterway. It is a relatively good climber, able to wriggle up wet rocky slopes, and is able to negotiate waterfalls up to 3 m high. It tends to be found upstream of waterfalls that block the movement of introduced salmonid fishes such as brown trout, rainbow trout, and <b>brook</b> <b>char.</b> Its original distribution was likely much larger, but trout species have eradicated it in all but the headwaters which make up its current home range.|$|E

40|$|Recent range {{extension}} of introduced salmonid species in insular Newfoundland has caused concern over {{their effects on}} native fish species. The present {{study was designed to}} investigate the habitat utilization of the exotic rainbow trout and the native <b>brook</b> <b>char</b> in streams of the Avalon Peninsula. Underwater field observations were carried out in a stream where the two species coexisted. <b>Brook</b> <b>char</b> occupied positions with significantly lower water velocities greater depth, and more cover than similar sized rainbow trout. Char showed similar microhabitat preferences regardless of the presence of trout. Behavioural observations of inter-specific pairs of fish at an in-stream viewing facility (Benthobservatory) showed that <b>brook</b> <b>char</b> were able to dominate rainbow trout in a slow flow (pool) environment. No species advantage was observed in a fast flow (riffle) environment. Subsequent experiments at the Benthobservatory provided evidence that trout preferred mid-stream stations in the main flow whereas char most often held station in slow flow areas usually associated with cover. Laboratory experiments designed to investigate the ability of one species, within its optimal temperature regime, to dominate another species indicated that <b>brook</b> <b>char</b> were most active, showed best growth, and were dominant over rainbow trout at 13 ﾟC. Trout showed their best growth and achieved dominance most often at 19 ﾟC. The results suggest that rainbow trout may realize a metabolic and behavioural advantage over char at high stream temperatures. [...] The data indicate that microhabitat preferences of rainbow trout and <b>brook</b> <b>char</b> in the stream environment are sufficiently different to permit cohabitation with minimal interaction. This habitat segregation likely resulted from interactions with other salmonids in their indigenous ranges...|$|E
40|$|A {{population}} of <b>brook</b> <b>char</b> (Salvelinus fontinalis) from lac Alain {{situated in the}} Portneuf river system of eastem Quebec was discovered to be introgressed with the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the more northerly occurring Arctic char (S. alpinus). Individuals from this population resembled typièal <b>brook</b> <b>char</b> based on allozyme analysis and several morphological and meristic characteristics. Based on RFLP analysis, all individuals were fixed for the Arctic char mtDNA haplotype, despite the present absence of Arctic char in the watershed. The geographical extent of mtDNA introgression {{was determined by the}} genetic assessment of populations from both within the Portneuf river system, as well as from neighboring watersheds. Introgressed populations were restricted to lakes occurring along one branch of the Portneuf river system, otherwise, elsewhere in the watershed. populations were that of geneticaIly pure <b>brook</b> <b>char.</b> AlI populations tested from neighboring drainages were aIso geneticaIly pure <b>brook</b> <b>char.</b> It is probable that a combination of biogeographical conditions coupled with positive selection for mtDNA introgression led to the present-day distribution of introgressed S. fontinalis. The evolutionary importance of mtDNA introgression was investigated by using an experimental approach which involved the assessment of physiological performance of both introgressed and non-introgressed <b>brook</b> <b>char</b> at different levels of biological organization. This approach aIlowed any physiologicaI advantage imparted by the intDNA of an arctic species (via the proteins it encodes), to be identified in introgressed <b>brook</b> <b>char.</b> As a tirst step of this approach, the catalytic efficiency, as weil as the thermal sensitivity of cytochrome C oxidase (CCO), an enzyme partly encoded by mtDNA was determined in red muscle mitochondria DifferentiaI responses in catalytic efficiency and QIO values between char groups were observed for CCO and suggest an influence by the mitochondriaI genome on enzyme structure and function. Based on these enzymatic differences, the prediction at the sub-cellular level of mitochondrial function, was that introgressed S. fontinalis would have mitochondria which function better al cold temperatures. Indeed, introgressed S. fontinalis were found to have heightened mitochondrial capacity at low temperatures (6 °C) based on the oxidation of malate and succinate in isolated red muscle mitochondria. These results provide supporting evidence for a mitochondrial genome influence on enzyme structure and function, as well as an influence at the sub-cellular level of mitochondrial function which is not neutral. The aerobic capacity and swimming performance of fish were evaluated using energetic parameters determined by swimming respirometry. At low temperatures, introgressed S. fontinalis were found to have a metabolic scope for aerobic activity similar to that of non-introgressed S. fontinalis. Further analysis of the metabolic scope revealed the potential for accommodating feeding metabolism was also similar between fish groups. These findings suggest that there is no apparent physiological basis related to swimming metabolism that could be of selective value to introgressed S. fontinalis. Still, further studies should be undertaken that evaluate the possibility of such a basis existing at earlier stages in the life history of introgressed S. fontinalis. Taken together the results from this study demonstrate, for the first time, that mtDNA variation resulting from introgressive events can be functionally important at the molecular and sub-cellular level and may be selectively maintained in natural populations. These findings are of particular interest to population and evolutionary biologists as mtDNA variation is traditionally believed to be of neutral consequence at all levels of biological organization. ...|$|E
40|$|In English, Salvelinus fontinalis is {{commonly}} referred to as the brook trout, even though it is more properly a <b>brook</b> charr (or <b>char).</b> However, here we use the more common, if somewhat misleading, name brook trout. Species identification Like other members of the salmon family, brook trout has a streamlined body with an adipose fin close to the tail. The back is dark green to brown, similar to the native brown trout (Salmo trutta), but with a distinctive marbled pattern of lighter colour, called vermiculations. The sides are lighter than the back, and have a sprinkling of pale (yellow) and red spots, the latter surrounded by blue “haloes”. The pectoral (breast), pelvic (belly), and anal fins have white edges followed by a contrasting black stripe. The belly colour may vary, depending on the time of year and reproductive state, from creamy white to reddish in the males when spawning; the latter making it loo...|$|R
40|$|Zoning {{algorithms}} {{were used}} to quantitatively classify strontium:calcium otolith sequences into fish environmental histories. Otoliths were acquired from 162 American eels (Anguilla rostrata) caught in the Gaspé region of Québec, Canada, and Sr:Ca ratios were determined at an interval of 10 µm along a transect from the core {{to the edge of}} each otolith (the otolith sequence) using an electron probe microanalyzer. Changes between freshwater and brackish water occupancy were determined with reference to a sample of non-anadromous species including <b>brook</b> <b>char</b> (freshwater) and Fundulus sp. (brackish water). Three algorithms were then applied separately to zone the sequences into environmental histories: (i) a local zoning algorithm, which used a split-moving window; (ii) a global zoning algorithm, which used a recursive method; and (iii) an optimization zoning algorithm, which maximized the combined value of selected statistics of the fitted model within a decision-rule framework. Zones were further classified into being of either freshwater or brackish water. All algorithms produced classifications that were not significantly different to those determined using the standard approach of qualitative interpretation, demonstrating the applicability of a quantitative approach. The advantages of the quantitative approach are that (i) the statistics of the model fit provide information on environmental history patterns that is generally not available from qualitative interpretation, and (ii) the parameters of the algorithm can be reported, allowing methodological consistency between different researchers, enabling the potential for more robust meta-analyses. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Ceratomyxa shasta infects {{salmonids}} in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of North America, occasionally causing {{losses in}} wild and captive populations. Host-specific parasite genotypes (O, I, II, III) were previously characterized molecularly using markers in the ribosomal DNA and phenotypically by type host in the Klamath River, CA/OR. This thesis sough to re-examine {{the composition of}} the parasite population elsewhere in the PNW and to further evaluate the host specificity of each genotype. I surveyed salmonids native to the PNW primarily from the Fraser, the Columbia and the Sacramento River basins. I also conducted sentinel studies on the Willamette and Deschutes Rivers that exposed native and non-native salmonids to parasite populations above and below migration barriers. These studies expanded upon the known host range of each genotype: O was specific to rainbow/steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coastal cutthroat trout (O. clarkii); I was specific with Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha); II was non-specific, being detected in six species, but predominating in coho (O. kitsuch), chum (O. keta), and pink (O. gorbuscha) salmon; and III was also non-specific infecting many native and non-native salmonids. Hosts infected with genotype III were considered “adequate” if myxospore development occurred, and included <b>brook</b> <b>char</b> (Salvelinus fontinalis), brown (Salmo trutta), rainbow, cutthroat, and steelhead trout; but Chinook, kokanee/sockeye (O. nerka) and Atlantic salmon (Salmon salar) were less suitable. The distribution, life history, and phylogenetic traits of each salmonid host are factors that potentially explain the host specificity and the spatial and temporal patterns of each genotype. Data collected in this thesis provide evidence that host-specific C. shasta coevolved with Pacific salmonids, adapting unique host-parasite relationships over time...|$|E
40|$|Results {{of field}} {{sampling}} and experiments suggest a strategy enabling Cyclops abyssorum tatricus {{to be the}} sole crustacean survivor in alpine lakes stocked with <b>brook</b> <b>char.</b> Reproductive pattern and population spatial distribution, egg resistance to char digestive enzymes, {{as well as the}} absence of cladocerans which would otherwise compete with Cyclops nauplii for scarce food resources, all ensure the survival of this planktonic crustacean. Most of the lakes in the Tatra Mountains, a granite rocky formation on the border of Poland and Czechoslovakia, were fish-free {{until the end of the}} 19 th century when stocking with salmonid fingerlings was first begun. Some lakes remained fishless until 1950 - 1960 and some are fishless even now. The introduction of salmonids to the Ta-tra lakes caused a drastic change in their zooplankton communities which has been well documented both by comparing plank-ton samples collected since 188 1 and by the paleolimnological analyses of sediment cores (Gliwicz 1963, 1967, 1980). Cladocerans and most copepod species disappeared, while two rotifer species, Keratella quadrata (Ehrbg.) and Polyarthra dolichoptera Idel-son, increased in numbers. Only one crustacean planktonic species, Cyclops abyssorum tatricus (Kozm.), has remained surprisingly unaffected and still persists in high densities despite the fact that it is eaten by the fish. The difference between the planktonic crustacean communities of the Tatra lakes before and after stocking is similar to the difference found between the communities in lakes which are presently fish-free (lake W) and stocked with fish (lakes P, Z, and C) in Table 1 and on Fig. 1. Extinction of cladocerans becomes evident a few years after a major stocking. The same species, C. a. tatricus, K. quad-rata, and P. dolichoptera, are found to b...|$|E
