25|$|The result was, in many respects, {{the most}} {{advanced}} icebreaker {{in the world at}} the time. Although bow propellers had been a common feature in icebreakers around the world for decades, it was incorrectly believed that they helped with the actual icebreaking process by reducing the pressure under the ice in front of the ship. However, extensive research and recent experiences had shown that bow propellers improved the icebreaking capability because their flushing effect reduced the friction between the <b>broken</b> <b>ice</b> floes and the hull of the ship. The drawback of a single bow propeller was that it would lubricate only one side of the hull. As a result, the new Finnish icebreaker was designed with two bow propellers which would produce a more powerful and, more importantly, symmetric flushing effect. Furthermore, a vessel with four propellers would be extremely maneuverable and capable of even moving sideways. Prior to the new Finnish icebreaker, only the 1947-built Canadian ferry Abegweit had been fitted with such propulsion arrangement. While the new ship was not the most powerful icebreaker in the world at the time, the power-to-displacement and power-to-beam ratios of the new Finnish icebreaker put her in a class of her own among icebreaking ships.|$|E
500|$|The five {{survivors}} slowly recovered {{their strength}} with {{a diet of}} seal meat. The ice was too thin for them to risk the final trip to Cape Evans, and the monotony of their diet and surroundings became wearisome. On 8 May [...] Mackintosh announced that he and Hayward intended to risk the ice and walk to Cape Evans. Against the strenuous objections of their companions they departed, and within the hour disappeared into a blizzard. The others went {{to look for them}} after the storm and found only tracks leading {{to the edge of the}} <b>broken</b> <b>ice.</b> Mackintosh and Hayward were never seen again. They had either fallen through the thin ice or had been carried out to sea on an ice floe. Richards, Joyce and Wild waited until 15 July to make the trip to Cape Evans, where they were at last reunited with Stevens, Cope, Jack and Gaze.|$|E

2500|$|This {{road was}} named the Road of Life (...) [...] As a road it was very dangerous. There was the risk of {{vehicles}} becoming stuck in the snow or sinking through <b>broken</b> <b>ice</b> caused by the constant German bombardment.

However, the lifeline did bring military and food supplies in and took civilians and wounded soldiers out, allowing the city to continue resisting their enemy.|$|E
2500|$|... the {{glaciologist}} and Director of the Mont Blanc Observatory at {{the time}} of the incident, published detailed accounts of his investigations into the Catastrophy of Saint Gervais. Measurements and photographs taken shortly afterwards showed that part of the glacier's snout (terminus) had been torn away, revealing a cavity 40 metres in diameter and 20 metres above its base. From this a 3 metre high tube led back some 85 metres and at a 36Â° angle to an even larger second cavity, up to 40m high and 50 m wide. Maps drawn up shortly afterwards confirmed a depression in the centre of the glacier. It was estimated that 100,000 cubic metres of liquid water had drained away during the glacier's collapse, plus a further 100,000 cubic metres of <b>broken</b> <b>ice.</b> Together with the soil and rock broken away by the force of the rushing water, Vallot estimated that a weight of 500 million kilograms of material had borne down on the villages. He also warned that a repeat of water build-up was quite likely to occur, and that this would become more dangerous as time went on. He advocated the use of explosives to ensure a permanent flow of meltwater away from the glacier.|$|E
2500|$|The Aleksandr Pushkin was {{constructed}} at VEB Mathias-Thesen Werft in Wismar, East Germany. She {{was the second}} ship of the [...] (also referred to as [...] "poet" [...] or [...] "writer" [...] class), named after the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The construction of this class featured some notable differences from contemporary ships built in the west. Amongst other things they offered cabins for six people and had three taps in the bathrooms - for hot, cold and sea water - Both of these features had long since been abandoned in western liners. The ships also featured certain forward-looking features, such as all outside accommodation for both passengers and the crew, and an indoor/outdoor swimming pool with a sliding glass roof. To enable the ships to navigate through <b>broken</b> <b>ice,</b> they were constructed with greater hull strength and stability than usual in passenger ships of this size. The Ivan Franko-class ships were also built with the use as a troopship in mind. Due to this they had unusually large provision and storage areas, enabling a cruising range of over [...] As a more visible sign of potential military use, the ships were equipped with unusually powerful deck lifting gear, apparently {{to be able to}} transport armoured vehicles on board. As built, the ship carried between 650-766 passengers in two classes, with different sources providing different figures. Additionally there were provisions for 500 cabinless passengers.|$|E

60|$|This was {{a mighty}} barrier of <b>broken</b> <b>ice,</b> which had {{probably}} been upheaved by the flow of cross currents when the sea was setting fast in autumn, or the action of conflicting bergs, {{many of which were}} imbedded in the mass, thus giving to it the appearance of a small mountain range with higher peaks rising above the general elevation.|$|E
60|$|At {{last they}} came to a place where the <b>broken</b> <b>ice</b> of the shore {{rendered}} passage for the sledge impossible.

This, as it turned out, was rather a fortunate circumstance.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examines}} the textural signatures of clouds, ice-covered mountains, solid and <b>broken</b> sea <b>ice</b> and floes, and open water. The textural features are computed from sum and difference histogram and gray-level difference vector statistics defined at various pixel displacement distances derived from Landsat multispectral scanner data. Polar cloudiness, snow-covered mountainous regions, solid sea ice, glaciers, and open water have distinguishable texture features. This suggests that textural measures can be successfully {{applied to the}} detection of clouds over snow-covered mountains, an ability of considerable importance for the modeling of snow-melt runoff. However, broken stratocumulus cloud decks and thin cirrus over <b>broken</b> sea <b>ice</b> remain difficult to distinguish texturally. It is concluded that even with high spatial resolution imagery, {{it may not be}} possible to distinguish broken stratocumulus and thin clouds from sea ice in the marginal ice zone using the visible channel textural features alone...|$|R
