Double pistons also spread out the forces of side loading while also reducing stroke length. Alternately, external sliding guides and hinges can support the load and reduce side loading forces applied directly on the cylinder.|$|E

40|$|Sealing {{interface}} {{materials and}} coatings are sacrificial, {{giving up their}} integrity {{for the benefit of}} the component. Seals that are compliant while still controlling leakage, dynamics, and coolant flows are sought to enhance turbomachine performance. Herein we investigate the leaf-seal configuration. While the leaf seal is classified as contacting, a ready modification using the leaf-housing arrangement in conjunction with an interface film rider (a <b>bore</b> <b>seal,</b> for example) provides for a film-riding noncontact seal. The leaf housing and leaf elements can be made from a variety of materials from plastic to ceramic. Four simplistic models are used to identify the physics essential to controlling leakage. Corroborated by CFD, these results provide design parameters for applications to within reasonable engineering certainty. Some potential improvements are proposed...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 43 Since {{the release}} of dual gas {{lubricated}} seal technology for process pumps over three years ago, this technology has provided a more versatile, efficient, safe, and less costly alternative to sealless pumps and traditional dual seals, primarily I the process pump market. In the past, to utilize this gas seal technology, the pump had to be fitted with an enlarged seal chamber, thus limiting its use on existing equipment and applications. Dual gas seal technology is now available for small <b>bore</b> <b>seal</b> chambers, allowing existing equipment to be retrofitted without any modification to the pump. Discussed herein is the design, the analytical tools used in the development along with the features and benefits of the seal. Also discussed are several applications utilizing dual gas seals on small bore process pumps...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 101 - 103). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Two hole-pattern seals are compared with one smooth <b>bore</b> <b>seal.</b> The two hole-pattern seals have cell depths of 2. 03 mm and 3. 18 mm with a cell diameter of 1. 59 mm. The hole area density factor for both hole-pattern seals is 43 %. The L/D ratio of the seals is 0. 75. Parametric identification tests were performed on all three seals for comparison, and results for impedance and leakage were obtained. Test conditions involved three speeds out to 20, 200 rpm and three inlet pressures out to 17. 2 bar with an exit-to-inlet pressure ratio of 40 % and 54 %. Results of the tests show that the 3. 18 mm hole-pattern seal has the highest average effective stiffness and lowest effective damping of all three seals. Results show that as cell depth increases, leakage decreases. Results also show that with increasing rotational speed, the exit temperature increases substantially. The two hole-pattern seals exhibit frequency dependent rotordynamic coefficients K([]), k([]), C([]), c([]). Measurements were compared with the ISTOSEAL program developed by Kleynhans and Childs (1997). Comparisons of leakage correlate extremely well with worse case conditions never exceeding 10 % between measurement and code prediction. Direct and effective stiffnesses were under-predicted in all cases; however, direct and effective damping correlated relatively well with measured results. Impedance predictions versus pressure ratio improve with increasing pressure ratio; however, leakage predictions are less accurate...|$|E

40|$|This investigative program {{examines}} {{leakage testing}} of elastomeric O-ring seals for a solid rocket casing and provides direction towards an improved nondestructive postassembly test. It also details test {{equipment for the}} Space Shuttle systems solid rocket boosters (SRB). The results are useful to designers of hardware for pressure containment vessels which use O-ring seals. Using several subscale seal and groove configuration test fixtures equipped with either two or three O-ring seals in series, seal integrity is investigated with both a pressure decay and flowmeter methods. Both types of test equipment adequately detect the practical range of expected seal leak rates of 1 to 0. 0001 sccs. The flowmeter leak test equipment appears to reduce testing time substantially. Limited seal leakage testing is performed on full-sized rocket motor segment seals, a pre-Challenger short stack, providing comparison of <b>bore</b> <b>seals</b> to test specimen <b>bore</b> and face <b>seals.</b> The conclusions are that seal reliability, verified via a performance pressure test, can be affected by temperature, quantity of grease, test pressure, and seal pressure load direction. Potential seal failure scenarios including contamination, seal damage, and sealing surface damage are discussed. Recommendations are made for an improved test procedure...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is presented to}} calculate damping in ring seals for a compressible fluid. Results show that damping in tapered ring seals (optimized for stiffness) is less than that in straight <b>bore</b> ring <b>seals</b> for the same minimum clearance.
