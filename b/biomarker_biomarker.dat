40|$|International audienceBackground: Melatonin synchronizes central {{but also}} {{peripheral}} oscillators (fetal adrenal gland, pancreas, liver, kidney, heart, lung, fat, gut, etc.), allowing temporal organization of biological functions through circadian rhythms (24 -hour cycles) {{in relation to}} periodic environmental changes and therefore adaptation {{of the individual to}} his/her internal and external environment. Measures of melatonin are considered the best peripheral indices of human circadian timing based on an internal 24 -hour clock. Methods: First, the pharmacology of melatonin (biosynthesis and circadian rhythms, pharmacokinetics and mechanisms of action) is described, allowing {{a better understanding of the}} short and long term effects of melatonin following its immediate or prolonged release. Then, research related to the physiological effects of melatonin is reviewed. Results: The physiological effects of melatonin are various and include detoxification of free radicals and antioxidant actions, bone formation and protection, reproduction, and cardiovascular, immune or body mass regulation. Also, protective and therapeutic effects of melatonin are reported, especially with regard to brain or gastrointestinal protection, psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular diseases and oncostatic effects. Conclusion: This review highlights the high number and diversity of major melatonin effects and opens important perspectives for measuring melatonin as a <b>biomarker</b> (<b>biomarker</b> of early identification of certain disorders and also biomarker of their follow-up) and using melatonin with clinical preventive and therapeutic applications in newborns, children and adults based on its physiological regulatory effects...|$|E
40|$|Objectives We {{evaluated}} {{the value of}} a single <b>biomarker,</b> <b>biomarker</b> panels, biomarkers combined with clinical signs of sepsis, and serial determinations of biomarkers in the prediction of bacteremia in patients with sepsis. Methods Adult patients visiting the emergency department because of a suspected infection with {{at least two of the}} following symptoms: temperature > 38. 3 °C or 90 /min, respiratory rate > 20 /min, chills, altered mental status, systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, MAP < 65 mmHg, and hyperglycemia in the absence of diabetes mellitus were included. Procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured, and two blood cultures were taken. The analyses included: (1) determination of the biomarker with the highest predictive value for bacteremia and to examine the predictive value of this biomarker in combination with other biomarkers; (2) analysis of the best biomarker data in combination with clinical signs of sepsis; and (3) analysis of serial determinations of the best biomarker. Results Of 342 included patients, PCT had the best predictive value for bacteremia with an area under the curve of 0. 80, sensitivity 89 %, specificity 58 %. The predictive value of a combination of PCT plus a panel of other biomarkers, clinical signs, or analysis of serial PCT levels did not lead to a significant improvement of the predictive value of PCT alone. Conclusions The ability of PCT to predict bacteremia in patients with sepsis does not further improve when combined with IL- 6, LBP, CRP, clinical signs, or serial measurements. Naturally, this does not exclude that a panel of other biomarkers may lead to different result...|$|E

30|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in developing}} the quantitative imaging of <b>biomarkers</b> in personalised medicine. <b>Biomarkers</b> are defined as “characteristics that are objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal biological processes, pathological processes, or pharmaceutical responses to a therapeutic intervention” [1]. Broadly, <b>biomarkers</b> fall into two categories: bio-specimen <b>biomarkers,</b> including molecular <b>biomarkers</b> and genetic <b>biomarkers,</b> and bio-signal <b>biomarkers</b> or imaging <b>biomarkers.</b> Bio-specimen <b>biomarkers</b> are obtained by removing a sample from a patient. Examples of these molecular <b>biomarkers</b> are genes and proteins detected from fluids or tissue samples. Bio-signal <b>biomarkers</b> remove no material from the patient, but rather detect and analyse an electromagnetic, photonic or acoustic signal emitted by the patient [2]. These imaging <b>biomarkers</b> {{have the advantage of}} being non-invasive, spatially resolved and repeatable [3]. They are of particular interest if they can overcome the limitations of the established histological “gold standards”. Indeed, invasive reference examinations, such as biopsy, can be inconclusive, are non-representative of the whole tissue (which is a tremendous limitation when assessing malignant tumours, which are known to be heterogeneous) and possess non-negligible levels of mortality and morbidity.|$|R

40|$|Samuel N Uwaezuoke Pediatric Nephrology Firm, Department of Pediatrics, University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Ituku-Ozalla, Enugu, Nigeria Abstract: Diabetic {{nephropathy}} (DN) {{is one of}} the microvascular {{complications of}} the kidney arising commonly from type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM), and occasionally from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Microalbuminuria serves as an early indicator of DN risk and a predictor of its progression as well as cardiovascular disease risk in both T 1 DM and T 2 DM. Although microalbuminuria remains the gold standard for early detection of DN, it is not a sufficiently accurate predictor of DN risk due to some limitations. Thus, there is a paradigm shift to novel <b>biomarkers</b> which would help to predict DN risk early enough and possibly prevent the occurrence of end-stage kidney disease. These new <b>biomarkers</b> have been broadly classified into glomerular <b>biomarkers,</b> tubular <b>biomarkers,</b> <b>biomarkers</b> of inflammation, <b>biomarkers</b> of oxidative stress, and miscellaneous <b>biomarkers</b> which also include podocyte <b>biomarkers,</b> some of which are also considered as tubular and glomerular <b>biomarkers.</b> Although they are potentially useful for the evaluation of DN, current data still preclude the routine clinical use of majority of them. However, their validation using high-quality and large longitudinal studies is of paramount importance, as well as the subsequent development of a <b>biomarker</b> panel which can reliably predict and evaluate this renal microvascular disease. This paper aims to review the predictive role of these <b>biomarkers</b> in the evaluation of DN.
