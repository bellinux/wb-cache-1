40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a {{ubiquitous}} human herpesvirus {{involved in}} the pathogenesis of {{a wide spectrum of}} malignant and non-malignant diseases. In healthy EBV carriers, the virus is believed to infect two major cellular targets - B lymphocytes and epithelial cells. While EBV latency is established predominantly, if not exclusively, in B-lymphocytes, virus replication can take place both in B cells and epithelial cells. Lytic replication ensures virus transmission to new carriers and replenishes the cellular reservoirs of virus persistence. The generally asymptomatic and harmless persistence of EBV relies on a tightly controlled immune response and distinct modes of virus/cell interactions observed at different stages of EBV life cycle. The aim of this thesis was to characterize the mutual influence of the host immune system and EBV at the replicative stage of virus infection. We showed that EBV enters monocytes and inhibits their differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs) without the need of viral gene expression. The sensitivity of the cells to virus-induced apoptosis progressively decreases along the process of DC maturation and is strongly dependent on the cell type in which the virus replicated before infecting DC precursors, since epithelial-cells derived viruses exhibited a significantly stronger pro-apoptotic activity than their B cell-derived counterparts. The capacity of the virus to suppress DC development might help in delaying the establishment of EBV specific immunity before the pool of infected B cells reaches the size sufficient for long-term virus persistence. During virus replication, both B cells and epithelial cells may escape recognition by cytotoxic CD 8 + T cells through downregulation of MHC class I molecules. Our work demonstrated that MHC class I heavy-chain and beta 2 m mRNA and protein synthesis are inhibited during EBV replication. Several other characteristic changes observed in the MHC class I processing and presentation pathway during the lytic cycle were recapitulated by chemical inhibition of protein synthesis. These results were recently confirmed by others and the viral protein responsible for host-cell global protein synthesis shutdown was shown to be encoded by the BGLF 5 open reading frame of the EBV genome. Triggering of receptors of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily participates both in determining the fate of B-lymphocytes during the process of their differentiation and in immunologic clearance of virus infected targets. Initiation of EBV lytic cycle counteracted sensitization to death induced by TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) that resulted from B-cell receptor (BCR) triggering in <b>Burkitt</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cells. Differential modulation of death-transmitting and decoy TRAIL receptors was associated with sensitization to TRAIL in response to BCR-triggering or protection from TRAIL by EBV lytic cycle. Interference with TRAIL-mediated checkpoints in B-cell differentiation may account for the involvement of EBV in autoimmune diseases. Decreased sensitivity to TRAIL may also protect EBV infected cells from recognition by CTL and NK-cells. B-cell homeostasis is severely perturbed during malaria infection. We showed that the CIDR 1 á domain of P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP 1), a multiadhesive protein expressed during the erythrocytic phase of the parasite life cycle, binds to B cells and induces EBV replication. This might partly explain the increased EBV viral load during malaria infection and the increased risk of B cell immortalization in the ontogenesis of endemic <b>Burkitt</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> Results presented in this thesis strengthen the notion that EBV replication actively modulates the functioning of the immune system at different levels through complex interactions of viral products with several types of cells and contributes to immune suppression, autoimmunity and tumorogenesis through a number of mechanisms whose details require further characterization. Research lines defined by this work may lead to new approaches towards management of EBV associated diseases...|$|E
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a {{ubiquitous}} γ-herpes virus with dual cell tropism {{for human}} B-lymphocytes and epithelial cells. EBV infection {{is linked to}} several malignancies such as <b>Burkitt</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (BL) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In vitro EBV is a potent transforming virus that converts resting B-lymphocytes into indefinitely proliferating lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs). The overall {{aim of this study}} was to develop and utilize bioinformatics methods to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which EBV modulates the cellular environment. EBV is a large DNA virus that encodes about 100 open reading frames (ORFs) expressed at various times during infection. Using established sequence search methods such as patterns and hidden Markov models (HMM), we have identified catalytic domains of ubiquitin specific proteases (deubiquitinating enzymes, DUBs) in a limited number of EBV ORFs. The DUB activity of three high scoring candidates: BPLF 1, BSLF 1 and BXLF 1, was confirmed by functional and mutational analysis (Paper-I). EBV establishes distinct programs of viral gene expression in latently infected and malignant cells. The EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) - 1 is expressed in all EBV carrying proliferating cells. EBNA- 1 has been associated with the induction of cellular oxidative stress due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage. To search for the cellular genes involved in these effects we used gene expression data sets from public databases. By analyzing the expression of genes involved in ROS metabolism in EBV positive and negative Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) we found that the NADPH oxidase (NOX) - 2 is induced in cells expressing EBNA- 1. Activation of the NOX 2 gene by EBNA- 1 is associated with the induction and/or maintenance of genomic instability, a critical step in malignant transformation (Paper-II). The expression of EBNA- 1 is associated with a global rearrangement of cellular transcription. To investigate the primary and secondary targets of this transcriptional effect we have analyzed the gene expression profiles of stable and inducible EBNA- 1 expressing cells. Functional analysis of the regulated transcripts revealed that EBNA- 1 influences the expression of genes involved in the maintenance of chromatin architecture. Several subunits of chromatin remodeling complexes were down-regulated on EBNA- 1 expression (Paper-III). Microarray analysis and systems biology approaches were implemented to investigate the cellular pathways modulated by tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII) a cellular protein that is highly expressed in BL cells and participates in the induction of the malignant phenotype. Comparison of the gene expression profiles of control and TPPII knockdown BL cells and systems level analysis of differentially regulated genes demonstrated that the MAPK signaling pathway is selectively inactivated by TPPII knockdown (Paper-IV). In summary, this work demonstrated the potential of bioinformatics tools and highthroughput genomic approaches in identifying the novel strategies of EBV...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological and {{molecular}} evidence link Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection {{to a variety}} of lymphoid and epithelial malignancies but the contribution of the virus to tumorigenesis is unclear. Genomic instability, defined by the establishment of a mutator phenotype and characterized by the occurrence of non-clonal chromosomal aberrations, excessive DNA damage and defects in DNA repair, is the hallmark of malignant transformation. In the studies described in this thesis, we have explored the possibility that EBV may promote malignant transformation by inducing genomic instability. As a first step in this analysis, the presence of non-clonal chromosomal aberrations, including dicentric chromosomes, chromosome fragments, gaps, rings, satellite associations and double minutes, was investigated in EBV positive and negative <b>Burkitt</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (BL) cell lines, in vitro EBV converted BLs and EBV genome-loss variants of EBV positive tumors. EBV carriage was associated with a significant increase in abnormal metaphase plates with prevalence of dicentric chromosomes, fragments and gaps. Increased phosphorylation of H 2 AX and lengthening of telomeres were detected in EBV positive cell lines suggesting DNA damage and telomere dysfunction as possible molecular mechanisms. Analysis of EBV gene expression revealed an increase of abnormal metaphases in cells expressing EBV latency I and further increase in latency III, suggesting that more than one viral protein may be responsible for this phenotype. EBNA- 1 is always expressed in EBV carrying proliferating cells. We investigated therefore the occurrence of genomic instability in cells expressing stable or inducible EBNA- 1. Chromosomal aberrations, increased DNA damage and activation of the DNA Damage Response (DDR) as detected by phosphorylation of the DNA damage sensing kinase ATM and its downstream target histone H 2 AX, were observed in EBNA- 1 expressing cells. These signs of genomic instability were associated with a significant increase of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS). Bioinformatic analysis of EBV regulated genes identified four genes within the ROS metabolic pathway as possible targets of EBV transcriptional regulation. The catalytic subunit of the ROS producing NADPH Oxidase 2 (Nox 2) was shown to be selectively upregulated in EBNA- 1 expressing cells. The involvement of Nox 2 in the production of ROS and induction of genomic instability was confirmed by functional inactivation using chemicals and RNAi. The possibility that more than one latency associated EBV product may be involved in the induction of genomic instability was addressed by investigating the occurrence of chromosomal aberrations increased DNA damage and DDR activation in a panel of transfected sub-lines of the B-lymphoma line BJAB carrying individual latency genes. In addition to EBNA- 1, expression of EBNA- 3 C and LMP- 1 was associated with these phenotypic markers of genomic instability. Each of these viral proteins appears to promote genomic instability through a different mechanism. Only EBNA- 1 directly induced DNA damage via ROS, while expression of LMP- 1 was associated with inhibition of DNA repair via downregulation of ATM, which resulted in failure to phosphorylate Chk 2 and consequent inactivation of the G 2 checkpoint. EBNA- 3 C expression induced a high degree of aneuploidy that was associated with inactivation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint and transcriptional downregulation of BubR 1. Collectively these results indicate that multiple cellular functions involved in the maintenance of genome integrity are independently targeted by EBV, pointing to the induction of genomic instability as critical event in viral oncogenesis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:Normal B-cells in the {{germinal}} center (GC) may {{be exposed to}} both tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and Fas-L. Whether abrogation of TRAIL apoptosis is a feature in the genesis of B cell lymphomas of GC-phenotype is not known. We assessed {{the integrity of the}} TRAIL pathway in Fas-resistant and Fas-sensitive <b>Burkitt</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphomas</b> (BLs). DESIGN AND METHODS:Expression of TRAIL receptors was determined by flow cytometry and Western blots. The extent of apoptosis following exposure to TRAIL was measured by annexin-V/propidium iodide dual staining. The integrity of the Fas and TRAIL apoptotic pathways was determined by Western blotting to assess cleavage of downstream caspases. Western blot analyses were used to determine the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and the profile of expression was correlated with response to TRAIL and CH 11. RESULTS:Our results demonstrate that BL expresses both functional and decoy TRAIL receptors. BLs with a functional Fas pathway retained sensitivity to TRAIL: Frequent and compound loss of expression of pro-apoptotic proteins can be identified in BLs resistant to Fas. However, loss of Bax, Bak and Bcl-Xs did not compromise sensitivity to TRAIL: INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS:Our results indicate that BLs frequently retain sensitivity to the TRAIL pathway. These results underscore the utility of TRAIL-based therapeutic strategies in the treatment of those B-cell lymphomas that may have compromised expression of several pro-apoptotic proteins.

40|$|Over recent years, {{the concept}} that many {{diseases}} can be aetiologically linked to infection {{by more than one}} pathogen has gained increased attention and awareness. Plasmodium falciparum (P. f) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are recognized co-factors in the genesis of endemic <b>Burkitt</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (eBL), a high grade B cell malignancy, accounting for up to 74 % of childhood cancers in equatorial Africa. In this thesis, we have investigated the interactions existing between P. f. and EBV that could lead to the emergence of eBL. A special emphasis was given to the effect of malarial antigens on B cell homeostasis and EBV reactivation. During intra-erythrocytic proliferation of P. f, parasite-derived proteins are successively expressed, exported and presented at the surface of the human red blood cell membrane. The cysteine-rich interdomain region 1 alpha (CIDR 1 alpha) of the P. f erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP 1) harbors a multi-adhesive phenotype able to bind to CD 36, CD 31 and immunoglobulins (Ig). This led us to investigate the effect of P. f infected erythrocyte (IE) and CIDR 1 alpha, on purified human B cell preparations. Both IE and CIDR 1 alpha bound to non-immune B cells and induced polyclonal activation accompanied by the production of cytokines and antibodies. This effect was partially mediated by B cell surface immunoglobulins (a constitutive part of the B cell receptor). Nevertheless, the different gene expression profiles obtained comparing the activation signature of CIDR 1 alpha and anti-Ig stimuli suggested that other molecules/signaling pathways were implicated in this activation process. CIDR 1 alpha preferentially activated the memory B cell compartment and was capable of rescuing germinal center B cells from spontaneous apoptosis, promoting cell cycle entry. Polyclonal B cell activation is a prominent feature of malaria. We have identified the CIDR 1 alpha domain of PfEMP 1 as a T cell-independent antigen that induces polyclonal B cell activation, shedding light on a possible molecular mechanism leading to hyper-gammaglobulinemia during malaria infection. After primary infection, EBV establishes a life long persistence in the host, residing in a latent state in memory B cells. P. f infection is associated with elevated EBV loads. Different but not exclusive causative effects have been proposed: i) the impairment of the EBV-specific T cell response resulting from malaria-induced immunosuppression and ii) the expansion of the pool of EBV-carrying B cells resulting from malaria-induced polyclonal B cell activation. We and others have recently demonstrated that children living in malaria endemic areas have elevated EBV levels in the plasma indicating that the high EBV loads observed during malaria infection could also result from active viral replication. This led us {{to assess the impact of}} CIDR 1 alpha on EBV reactivation using the EBV positive BL cell line Akata as a model. Upon stimulation with CIDR 1 alpha, quantitative determination by real time PCR revealed an increased EBV load in the Akata cell cultures. The increased viral load resulted from lytic cycle reactivation as confirmed by experiments performed using an Akata line-based system in which the induction of lytic cycle was reflected by an enhanced expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). CIDR 1 alpha stimulation led to an augmentation of GFP positive cells. Moreover, the virus production in CIDR 1 alpha-exposed cultures was directly proportional to the number of GFP-positive Akata cells (lytic EBV) and to increased expression of the EBV lytic promoter BZLF 1. CIDR 1 alpha also induced the production of EBV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from healthy donors and from children with eBL. Our results demonstrate that P. f antigens, such as CIDR 1 alpha, can directly drive an EBV latently infected B cell into lytic cycle. We subsequently monitored the activity of all known herpes viruses (HHVs) infecting humans in saliva and plasma samples from children having acute malaria (day- 0) and 14 days after they received anti-malaria treatment (day- 14). Children with acute P. f malaria infection had elevated levels of circulating EBV, these levels being cleared after recovery. Acute malaria infection was not associated to an increased plasma load of HSV- 1, CMV, HHV. 6 or HHV- 7, as compared to the control groups (malaria day- 14 and malaria negative). However, we observed a profound reduction of HSV- 1 levels in the saliva after anti-malarial treatment whereas the salivary loads of other HHVs, including EBV, were unchanged. Due to the low detection rates of HSV- 2, VZV and HHV- 8 in our study, we couldn t draw any significant conclusions on their activity during P. f infection. Taken together our results suggest the existence of an intimate link between malaria and EBV. The elevated EBV loads observed during malaria infection seems to result not only from an impairment of the EBV-specific T cell response and polyclonal B cell activation but also from viral reactivation directly driven by malarial antigens. In conclusion, this thesis provides unique insights on the molecular mechanisms underlying polyclonal B cell activation and EBV reactivation during Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection and on how two pathogens can co-operate in lymphoma pathogenesis...|$|E

40|$|Background:Fascin is an actin {{cross-linking}} protein, {{which is}} part of the cytoskeleton and involved in cell motility in several cell types. The differentiation of epithelial cells is greatly influenced by cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions, which play an important role in the normal organisation and stabilisation of epithelial cells and maintain the cells in a non-migratory state. The malignant conversion of epithelial cells results from a phenotypic switch to a migratory state, which allows tumour invasion beyond the basement membrane, as well as metastasis. Such a switch requires complex rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and is governed by multiple actin-binding proteins including fascin. In non-neoplastic lymphoid tissue, fascin expression is highly selective and is predominantly localised in dendritic cells, while lymphocytes, plasma cells, etc are uniformly non-reactive. However, all or nearly all Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants in all types of Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> express fascin and are strongly immunoreactive for fascin.

Our data show that curcumin treatment results in down-regulation of constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via generation of reactive oxygen species where it causes conformational changes in Bax protein leading to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c to the cytosol. This leads to activation of caspase- 9, caspase- 3, and poly(ADP) -ribose polymerase cleavage leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis. In addition, curcumin treatment of Burkitt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cell lines also causes up-regulation of DR 5; however, this up-regulation does not result in apoptosis.

Lin and colleagues collected blood from 40 NHL patients prior to therapy. Monocytes from NHL patients suppressed T-cell proliferation, were unresponsive to Toll-like receptor stimulation by CpG and resistant to maturing into CD 83 (+) dendritic cells. This suppression was mediated {{in part through}} arginine metabolism, as exogenous arginine supplementation reversed this, and NHL patients had elevated arginase I in their plasma. These cells had decreased HLA-DR and TNF-alpha receptor II (CD 120 b) expression compared with controls. Patients with increased ratios of CD 14 (+) HLA-DRlow/- monocytes had more advanced disease and suppressed immune functions, indicating that CD 14 (+) HLA-DRlow/- monocytes are a pivotal and profoundly effective contributor to systemic immunosuppression in NHL...|$|R

40|$|A Masters Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Who am I? I investigate this question, using graphic inventories and written narratives as autoethnographic method to document social selves. I utilise Ian <b>Burkitt</b> <b>s</b> theoretical discussion of social selves, but draw on my own experiences {{of the home and}} the family to represent and display social individuality as auto ethnography. I suggest that social and historical relationships are not separate from the self and I argue that the self is formed in daily social relations with others, which can be documented through drawing and writing. I use autoethonography to employ a practice that creates works through narrative and inventory. I use a practice-led methodology to frame my use of autoethnography as a method of creating art practice through narratives and inventories The body of the thesis is structured in three sections. Situating Practice (Chapters One- Three, which establish my theoretical parameters) and Inventories and Narratives (Chapters Four-Nine, which record my domestic spaces, such as cupboards, and narrate my family interactions and activities). My social relations are remembered as behaviours, which constitute self-knowledge and are accessed through material culture in objects. In positioning my relations with spaces and objects I refer to artists such as Mark Dion, Michael Landy and Rachel Whiteread. The Findings section of the thesis discusses the application of <b>Burkitt</b> <b>s</b> social selves as a form of art practice. I conclude that written narratives and graphic inventories can change the display of social selves and the practise of creating them; by showing and telling is an attempt to answer the question Who am I?...|$|R

Addition of such adenylate cyclase-containing {{extracts}} to beta-adrenergic receptor-replete membranes from adenylate cyclase-deficient <b>S</b> 49 <b>lymphoma</b> cells {{results in the}} production of a catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase system.
