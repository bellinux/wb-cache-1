50|$|The Silk Road Economic <b>Belt</b> <b>and</b> the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road, {{also known}} as the <b>Belt</b> <b>and</b> Road Initiative (BRI) <b>and</b> The <b>Belt</b> <b>and</b> Road (B&R), is a {{development}} strategy proposed by China's paramount leader Xi Jinping that focuses on connectivity and cooperation between Eurasian countries, primarily the People's Republic of China (PRC), the land-based Silk Road Economic <b>Belt</b> (SREB) <b>and</b> the oceangoing Maritime Silk Road (MSR). The strategy underlines China's push to take a larger role in global affairs, and the desire to coordinate manufacturing capacity with other countries in areas such as steel manufacturing. It was unveiled in September and October 2013 in announcements revealing the SREB and MSR, respectively. It was also promoted by Premier Li Keqiang during the state visit to Asia and Europe. It was the most frequently mentioned concept in the People's Daily in 2016. The initiative in the initial days was also called One <b>Belt</b> <b>and</b> One Road in English, but in mid-2016, the official English name was changed to the <b>Belt</b> <b>and</b> Road Initiative due to misinterpretation of the one in the name.|$|R

5|$|A {{pulmonary}} contusion {{is usually}} caused directly by blunt trauma {{but can also}} result from explosion injuries or a shock wave associated with penetrating trauma. With the use of explosives during World Wars I and II, pulmonary contusion resulting from blasts gained recognition. In the 1960s its occurrence in civilians began to receive wider recognition, in which cases it is usually caused by traffic accidents. The use of seat <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> airbags reduces the risk to vehicle occupants.|$|E

5|$|Beta Pictoris {{shows an}} excess of {{infrared}} emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star. Detailed observations reveal a large disk of dust and gas orbiting the star, {{which was the first}} debris disk to be imaged around another star. In addition to the presence of several planetesimal <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris debris disk is thought to be the dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Geospace is {{populated}} by electrically charged particles {{at very low}} densities, the motions of which are controlled by the Earth's magnetic field. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth's upper atmosphere. During geomagnetic storms two regions of geospace, the radiation <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> the ionosphere, can become strongly disturbed. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, disrupting telecommunications and GPS technologies, and {{can also be a}} hazard to astronauts, even in low Earth orbit. They also create aurorae seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the geomagnetic poles.|$|E

As they board the Devil's Flight roller coaster, Wendy has a premonition that the hydraulics securing the seat <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> coaster cars will fail during the ride and kill everyone on board. She panics, a fight breaks out and several people leave or are forced off the ride. They include Kevin; best friends Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin; alumnus Frankie Cheeks; athlete Lewis Romero; and goth couple Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer. They see the roller coaster derail, killing the remaining passengers, including Jason and Carrie, leaving Wendy and Kevin devastated.|$|E
5|$|Prevention {{measures}} include use {{of protective}} technology in vehicles, such as seat <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> sports or motorcycle helmets, {{as well as}} efforts {{to reduce the number}} of collisions, such as safety education programs and enforcement of traffic laws. Depending on the injury, treatment required may be minimal or may include interventions such as medications, emergency surgery or surgery years later. Physical therapy, speech therapy, recreation therapy, occupational therapy and vision therapy may be employed for rehabilitation. Counseling, supported employment, and community support services may also be useful.|$|E

5|$|The {{dress code}} of the British headbangers {{reflected}} the newly found cohesion of the movement and recalled the look of 1960s rockers and American bikers. The common elements were long hair and jeans, black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers. Elements of militaria, such as bullet <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became the uniform of metalheads worldwide.|$|E
