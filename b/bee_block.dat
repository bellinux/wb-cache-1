25|$|Some {{chimpanzees}} use {{tools to}} hunt large bees (Xylocopa sp.) which make nests in dead branches {{on the ground}} or in trees. To get to the grubs and the honey, the chimpanzee first tests for the presence of adults by probing the nest entrance with a stick. If present, adult <b>bees</b> <b>block</b> the entrance with their abdomens, ready to sting. The chimpanzee then disables them with the stick to make them fall out and eats them rapidly. Afterwards, the chimpanzee opens the branch with its teeth to obtain the grubs and the honey.|$|R

50|$|The Pearson-Arastradero Preserve {{is unusual}} in its {{intensive}} ecological restoration program where Acterra, a Palo Alto-based environmental group, acts as a steward for the preserve and engages community volunteers in programs that combine habitat restoration with environmental education and accommodate {{a wide range of}} volunteers from high schools to local corporations. Their projects focus primarily on removing yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), Medusahead grass (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), poison hemlock (Conium maculatum), Italian thistle (Carduus pycnocephalus), wild mustard and teasel and replacing these invasives with native species. In 2006, Acterra conducted a large-scale creek daylighting project and continues to work on creek stabilization, sediment harvesting and planting riparian species. Reforestation projects focus on native oaks, including planting and caging young native oaks, and removal of high fire-danger eucalyptus. To encourage and support a greater diversity of fauna, Acterra volunteers install nesting boxes, bird perches, raptor poles, bat houses, <b>bee</b> <b>blocks</b> and brush piles. The Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society maintains and places bird houses and co-leads bird hikes with Acterra. Currently Acterra is conducting a preserve-wide weed and biodiversity hotspot map to guide future management strategies. There is an installation of native flora at the preserve's interpretive center.|$|R

50|$|Block {{codes are}} tied to the sphere packing problem which has {{received}} some attention over the years. In two dimensions, it is easy to visualize. Take a bunch of pennies flat on the table and push them together. The result is a hexagon pattern like a <b>bee's</b> nest. But <b>block</b> codes rely on more dimensions which cannot easily be visualized. The powerful Golay code used in deep space communications uses 24 dimensions. If used as a binary code (which it usually is), the dimensions refer to the length of the codeword as defined above.|$|R

He was inspired as a child to rap when one day The Fearless Four were performing in his neighborhood and invited him to say a rhyme on their mic. Gibson's first musical endeavor was a short-lived rap group with his family named Disco Cousins, and he rapped under the name Baby Breeze.|$|R
50|$|Females {{in search}} of nesting sites are {{attracted}} to existing holes in wood materials where nests are usually formed. Upon arrival at a desirable site {{where there are no}} current inhabitants, the female will inspect the existing tunnel system extensively. If the hole is an occupied and guarded nest, the guarding <b>bee</b> will <b>block</b> the entrance. If not guarded, a resident of the nest will come to block the entrance if in the area by protruding their head from the hole. The stranger will hover around the hole for a brief period of time, and often the resident will attempt to chase the stranger away. If the intruder is able to bypass the resident bee at the entrance, a struggle will ensue accompanied by loud buzzing noises. These struggles can last up to a couple hours. Either the intruder is then thrown out, or will throw out the resident, at which point the process for a takeover occurs, beginning with the eviction of any existing brood. The benefits of guarding behavior can clearly be seen here as strangers hardly ever intrude on social nests containing more than one adult.|$|R
40|$|DESCRIBE THE IDEA We have {{designed}} the ‘Bee Brick’ {{to provide a}} nesting site to support the declining solitary bee population. ‘Britain has more than 250 bee species, but numbers have fallen dramatically due to disease, an increase in chemical use and habitat loss (Friends of the Earth 2013). The bee brick is specifically designed to {{be an integral part}} of the build and offers the dual function of being a construction material that also promotes biodiversity. It has been designed to be included in new build projects as a ‘fit and forget’ component, and to sit alongside current green systems such as Solar panels, rainwater harvesting, ground source heat pump systems and Sedan roofs. WHAT IS NEW ABOUT IT (100) Main stream construction materials primary function is to perform as structural components within the fabric of new buildings. We have taken these materials as starting points, and created habitats for bee’s displaced by the construction process to become hubs for greater biodiversity within new community’s. HOW FAR HAVE YOU PUT IT INTO PRACTICE AND WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR THE FUTURE (100) To date we have produced a working method in-house for batch production of the ‘bee brick’ along with its stand alone partner the ‘bee block’. The <b>bee</b> <b>block’s</b> can be used on their own or stacked. We are working with the structural engineering team at Plymouth university to establish its suitability as a building material and provide relevant performance tests to prove this. We are also drawing on the expertise of Bio scientist’s from Exeter university to test prototypes and working models in controlled environments and measure and record the results. HOW DOES IT BENEFIT PEOPLE, THE ENVIRONMENT OR ANIMAL WELFARE? (UP TO 300 WORDS – INCLUDE EVIDENCE WHERE AVAILABLE) *? Biodiversity loss has been highlighted as a key worldwide issue. In October 2010 in Japan, over 190 countries around the world reached a historic global agreement to take urgent action to halt the loss of biodiversity. In response to this Defra’s Biodiversity 2020 strategy was created to ‘halt overall biodiversity loss, support healthy ecosystems and establish coherent ecological networks’. This is particularly important in light of the Governments plans for additional housing. In 2007 the Government set a target of increasing the supply of housing to 240, 000 additional homes per year by 2016 (Wilson, 2007). According to English Nature not all development is harmful and, ‘given careful location and design, can even be carried out to enhance wildlife’. However, without careful attention to location, layout and design, habitats can be partially or totally destroyed. (English Nature, 2006). The design of the bee brick is in direct response to these issues. Providing habitats for the next generation of pollinating bee species is vitally important. Adapting and rethinking how we use existing building components makes implementing these goals viable at a scale necessary to see real change and promote biodiversity...|$|R
5000|$|The maze is {{inhabited}} by [...] "snow bees" [...] that are deadly so must be avoided. They move {{around in a}} semi-random way: a bee may sometimes choose {{to get away from}} Pengi instead of chasing him (especially on early levels). The bees can be killed by crushing them with a moving ice <b>block</b> (<b>bees</b> do not stop the blocks so more than one bee can be killed with one kick) or by kicking the fence while they are touching it. This momentarily stuns them and they can be crushed by simply walking over them. Only a set number of bees are on the screen at once (e.g. 3 on level 1) but there are more (a total of 6 on level 1) which emerge from the diamond blocks as others are killed. A level is completed either by killing all of the bees or by lining up the special diamond blocks. This is the preferred way of completing the level because a huge points bonus is awarded (5,000 if they are touching the fence, 10,000 if they are not).|$|R
40|$|Acetylcholine (ACh) is an {{important}} neuromodulator of cardiac function that is released upon stimulation of the vagus nerve. Despite numerous reports on activation of IKACh by acetylcholine in cardiomyocytes, {{it has yet to}} be demonstrated what role this channel plays in cardiac conduction. We studied the effect of tertiapin, a <b>bee</b> venom peptide <b>blocking</b> IKACh, to evaluate the role of IKACh in Langendorff preparations challenged with ACh. ACh (0. 5 [*]μM) reproducibly and reversibly induced complete atrioventricular (AV) blocks in retroperfused guinea-pig isolated hearts (n= 12). Tertiapin (10 to 300 [*]nM) dose-dependently and reversibly prevented the AV conduction decrements and the complete blocks in unpaced hearts (n= 8, P< 0. 01). Tertiapin dose-dependently blunted the ACh-induced negative chronotropic response from an ACh-induced decrease in heart rate of 39 ± 16 % in control conditions to 3 ± 3 % after 300 [*]nM tertiapin (P= 0. 01). These effects were not accompanied by any significant change in QT intervals. Tertiapin blocked IKACh with an IC 50 of 30 ± 4 [*]nM with no significant effect on the major currents classically associated with cardiac repolarisation process (IKr, IKs, Ito 1, Isus, IK 1 or IKATP) or AV conduction (INa and ICa(L)). In summary, tertiapin prevents dose-dependently ACh-induced AV blocks in mammalian hearts by inhibiting IKACh...|$|R
50|$|The 19th century {{saw this}} {{revolution}} in beekeeping practice completed through {{the perfection of}} the movable comb hive by the American Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth. Langstroth {{was the first person}} to make practical use of Huber's earlier discovery that there was a specific spatial measurement between the wax combs, later called the bee space, which <b>bees</b> do not <b>block</b> with wax, but keep as a free passage. Having determined this bee space (between 5 and 8 mm, or 1/4 to 3/8"), Langstroth then designed a series of wooden frames within a rectangular hive box, carefully maintaining the correct space between successive frames, and found that the bees would build parallel honeycombs in the box without bonding them to each other or to the hive walls. This enables the beekeeper to slide any frame out of the hive for inspection, without harming the bees or the comb, protecting the eggs, larvae and pupae contained within the cells. It also meant that combs containing honey could be gently removed and the honey extracted without destroying the comb. The emptied honey combs could then be returned to the bees intact for refilling. Langstroth's book, The Hive and Honey-bee, published in 1853, described his rediscovery of the bee space and the development of his patent movable comb hive.|$|R
40|$|An {{intravenous}} K+-sensitive electrode {{has been}} used to monitor plasma [K+] changes induced by alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists in anaesthetized guinea-pigs, rabbits and rats. The effects of phentolamine and propranolol on these responses were studied. In the guinea-pig both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists produced a biphasic response consisting of an initial rapid increase in [K+] which was followed, within 1 min, by a fall below baseline. The antagonist studies indicated that in this species both phases of the response could be elicited by either alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor activation. In the rabbit the responses were both slower and smaller than those seen in the guinea-pig and required larger agonist doses. In addition {{it was found that the}} increase in plasma [K+] was alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated while the subsequent fall was seen only with beta-adrenoceptor activation. In the rat triphasic changes in plasma [K+] were seen consisting of an initial decrease which was alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated, followed by an increase and then a second fall which was elicited by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. The increase in plasma [K+] was only slightly reduced by either alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Apamin, a toxin from <b>bee</b> venom which <b>blocks</b> Ca 2 +-activated K+-channels, was found to block the hyperkalaemic phase of the response in the guinea-pig and rabbit but had no effect in the rat. It is concluded that there are marked species differences in the effects of adrenoceptor agonists on plasma [K+] in vivo...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{molecular}} dynamics simulations, molecular docking, and homology modeling {{methods have been}} used in combination to design possible inhibitors as well as to study the structural changes and function of target proteins related to diseases that today are in the spotlight of drug discovery. The inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels constitute the first target in this study; they are involved in cardiac problems. On the other hand, tensin, a promising target in cancer research, is the second target studied here. The first chapter includes a brief update on computational methods and the current proposal of the combination of MD simulations and docking techniques, a procedure that is applied for the engineering of a new blocker for Kir 2. 1 ion channels and for the design of possible inhibitors for Tensin. Chapter two focuses in Kir ion channels that belong to the family of potassium-selective ion channels which have a wide range of physiological activity. The resolved crystal structure of a eukaryotic Kir channel was used as a secondary structure template to build the Kir-channels whose crystallographic structures are unavailable. Tertiapin (TPN), a 21 a. a. peptide toxin found in honey <b>bee</b> venom that <b>blocks</b> a type of Kir channels with high affinity was also used to design new Kir channel blockers. The computational methods homology modeling and protein-protein docking were employed to yield Kir channel-TPN complexes that showed good binding affinity scores for TPN-sensitive Kir channels, and less favorable for Kir channels insensitive to TPN block. The binding pocket of the insensitive Kir-channels was studied to engineer novel TPN-based peptides that show favorable binding scores via thermodynamic mutant-cycle analysis. Chapter three is focused on the building of homology models for Tensin 1, 2 and 3 domains C 2 and PTP using the PTEN X-ray crystallographic structure as a secondary structure template. Molecular docking was employed for the screening of druggable small molecules and {{molecular dynamics}} simulations were also used to study the tensin structure and function in order to give some new insights of structural data for experimental binding and enzymatic assays. Chapter four describes the conformational changes of FixL, a protein of bradyrhizobia japonicum. FixL is a dimer known as oxygen sensor that is involved in the nitrogen fixation process of root plants regulating the expression of genes. Ligand behavior has been investigated after the dissociation event, also the structural changes that are involved in the relaxation to the deoxy state. Molecular dynamics simulations of the CO-bound and CO-unbound bjFixL heme domain were performed during 10 ns in crystal and solution environments then analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our results show that the diffusion of the ligand is influenced by internal motions of the bound structure of the protein before CO dissociation, implying an important role for Arg 220. In turn, the location of the ligand after dissociation affects the conformational changes within the protein. The study suggests the presence of a cavity close to the methine bridge C of the heme group in agreement with spectroscopic probes and that Arg 220 acts as a gate of the heme cavity...|$|R
