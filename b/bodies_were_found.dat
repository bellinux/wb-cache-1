5|$|The victims' <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> {{floating}} in Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989. The first {{body was found}} when several people on board a sailboat, crossing under the Sunshine Skyway, saw an object in the water. The second body was seen floating off the pier in St. Petersburg, two miles north from the first. While the Coast Guard went to recover the second body, a call came in about a third, which was seen floating 200 yards to the east. All three female <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> face down, bound with a rope around the neck, and naked below the waist.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{several young}} women had {{disappeared}} from Isla Vista in late 1976, Christiansen's first confirmed victim was Patricia Marie Laney, who disappeared January 18, 1977. The next day, her <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> on an isolated road in Refugio Canyon, in the Santa Ynez Mountains northwest of Isla Vista near Rancho del Cielo. Jacqueline Anne Rook's <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> {{the day after}} that, near Laney's. Mary Ann Sarris's <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> on May 22, 1977, near Los Alamos.

5|$|After the Bersiap in 1947 Dutch {{authorities}} {{attempted to}} retrieve {{the bodies of the}} victims and several survivors of the period provided legal testimony to the Attorney General office. Due to continued revolutionary warfare few <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> and few cases came to court. Around 3,500 graves of Bersiap victims {{can be found in the}} Kembang Kuning war cemetery in Surabaya and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|On February 9, 1945 a B-24 Liberator bomber {{crashed on}} Mount Harrison in the Albion Division {{of the forest}} during a {{training}} mission in dense fog. All nine crew {{were killed in the}} crash, and their <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> inside the plane and recovered over the following days. The plane's remains have never been removed. A memorial service was held on July 29, 2004 and a plaque was permanently installed honoring those who died.|$|E
5|$|All {{bodies were}} in similar flexed {{positions}} lying on their left sides with knees raised up towards their chin. In comparison, most bodies excavated from Egypt {{dating to the}} predynastic period are in a similar position, however at Merimda Beni Salama and El-Amra <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> on their right sides. From the time these bodies were buried up until the Middle Kingdom period, the dead were laid on their sides. After this period they were buried on their backs (dorsal position), and from the Fifth Dynasty the bodies were always fully extended.|$|E
50|$|Ruiz {{stated that}} Crockett's <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> {{on the west}} side of the garrison, contradicting Susannah Dickinson's claim that he lay between the chapel and the low barracks to the south. He stated that Travis' <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> on a gun {{carriage}} on the north wall, with a single bullet wound to the forehead; and that Bowie's <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in one of the rooms on the south side, on a bed.|$|R
50|$|The sale of handguns, stunguns {{and pepper}} spray {{increased}} {{dramatically in the}} University of Nevada, Reno area after Denison's <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found.</b> Denison's mother founded the Bring Bri Justice Foundation to try to implement changes after Denison's <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found.</b>|$|R

5|$|All {{the crew}} {{on board the}} ship {{at the time of}} the {{incident}} (41 in total) are believed to have died, although not all the <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found.</b> In addition, one visitor to the ship (an officer's wife) and eight terminal workers were killed. Initial efforts to contain the fire were hampered by a lack of organization and poorly maintained fire-fighting equipment at the terminal. The Bantry fire brigade spent some time waiting at the town pier for a launch to take them onto the island. The terminal's own fire engine would not start. Firefighters had to break into the terminal's main depot to access materials and equipment (much of which did not work).|$|E
5|$|During press {{conferences}} on 13 and 14 December, DCS Gull revealed that police believed the locations where the five <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> {{to have been}} 'deposition sites', not murder scenes, indicating that the victims were all killed elsewhere and transported to the locations where they were later found; no comment was made on where the women may have been murdered. DCS Gull also revealed that some items of women's clothing and accessories, including a handbag and jacket, had been recovered and were being forensically tested to establish whether they belonged {{to any of the}} murdered women.|$|E
5|$|The BVE {{vanished}} after 1981 but, from 1983 onwards, the GAL began {{carrying out}} similar attacks and abductions. The first in Bayonne occurred on 17 October 1983, when alleged ETA members Joxe Lasa Arostegi and José Ignacio Zabala disappeared. Their mutilated <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> in Alicante in 1985. An unsuccessful kidnapping attempt occurred {{the following day}} and, in December, Ramón Oñaederra, an alleged ETA member and Mikel Goikoetxea, an alleged ETA leader, were assassinated by the GAL in separate incidents. Prior to the Monbar attack, two people had been killed and six injured in three separate attacks in the town in 1985.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failure}} of UNOSOM in 1991-2, the US led a {{multinational}} mission—UNITAF—which included military forces to ensure aid was distributed to Somalis. The US military entered Mogadishu on December 9, 1992, and moved to quickly secure the abandoned embassy, along with the airport and port. The following day, key military staff moved into the embassy to establish headquarters for the UNITAF mission, with the main headquarters located within the chancery. The embassy complex itself was in disrepair; buildings had been stripped bare, a foot (0.3m) of debris and trash covered the floors of the chancery, and <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> in some areas on the premises. Personnel promptly set out cleaning the compound's living spaces and work areas {{to make room for}} the arrival and assembly area. Old warehouses were razed, and new barracks, heads and galleys were erected in their place. US Navy support elements that arrived later also imported extra materials.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, Meridian {{was home}} to a Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) office and several other activist organizations. James Chaney and other local residents, along with Michael Schwerner, his wife Rita, and Andrew Goodman, volunteers from New York City, worked to create a {{community}} center. They held classes during Freedom Summer to help prepare African Americans {{in the area to}} prepare to regain their constitutional franchise, after having been excluded from politics since disenfranchisement in 1890. Whites in the area resented the activism, and physically attacked civil rights workers. In June 1964, Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman went to Neshoba County, Mississippi, to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned. The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian. Following a massive FBI investigation, their murdered <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> two months later, buried in an earthen dam.|$|E
5|$|In Nuevo León, fifteen {{people were}} {{confirmed}} to have died: one bricklayer who died after a housing unit under construction collapsed {{on top of}} him; two men {{and a woman who}} died after their vehicle rolled over and crashed into a semi-trailer truck due to the intense rainfall; a 25-year-old who was swept away by swift currents and pinned against a fence; an elderly man who died after a wall toppled over him, a woman who died after a large boulder from a rock slide fell on her home, and a young man who fell onto the Arroyo Topo Chico. Eight more <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> after floodwaters began receding, although one {{is believed to have been}} washed away from a cemetery. Twenty people in Nuevo León were reported missing.|$|E
25|$|Christine Weller, 12, from Surrey, British Columbia, was {{abducted}} on November 17, 1980. Her <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> {{more than a}} month later on Christmas Day; she had been strangled with a belt and stabbed repeatedly. On April 16, 1981, Colleen Marian Daignault, 13, vanished. Five months later her <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found.</b> On April 22, 1981, Daryn Todd Johnsrude, 16, {{was abducted}} and killed; his <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> less than two weeks later. On May 19, 1981, 16-year-old Sandra Wolfsteiner was murdered, and 13-year-old Ada Anita Court was murdered in June 1981.|$|R
50|$|Her <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> to <b>be</b> incorrupt in 1906.|$|R
50|$|Her <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in {{the ruins}} of her burnt Ossipee Lake two-story cottage on September 28, 1916. Mr. Small had been at the cottage that evening, but was {{traveling}} back to Boston when the <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found.</b> Mrs. Small's skull was crushed and also had a cord wrapped around her neck. She had also been shot, and there was evidence she had <b>been</b> chloroformed. The <b>body</b> would have <b>been</b> destroyed by the fire {{except for the fact that}} the fire had compromised the floor of the cottage. The <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> floating in the flooded basement.|$|R
5|$|Oba Chandler (October 11, 1946November 15, 2011) was an American man {{convicted and}} {{executed}} for the June 1989 triple murders of Joan Rogers {{and her two}} daughters, whose <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found,</b> with their hands and feet bound, floating in Tampa Bay, Florida. Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive, with ropes around their necks with a concrete block tied {{at the other end}} of the rope. The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted, on billboards, enlarged copies of the suspect's handwriting recovered on a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the handwriting. This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S.; billboards became useful tools in searches for missing people.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of the fall of Lang Vei three {{companies}} of the NVA 101D Regiment moved into jump-off positions to attack Alpha-1, an outpost just outside the Combat Base held by 66 men of Company A, 1st Platoon, 1/9 Marines. At 04:15 on 8 February under cover of fog and a mortar barrage, the North Vietnamese penetrated the perimeter, overrunning most of the position and pushing the remaining 30 defenders into the southwestern portion of the defenses. For some unknown reason, the NVA troops did not press their advantage and eliminate the pocket instead throwing a steady stream of grenades at the Marines. At 07:40 a relief force from Company A, 2nd Platoon set out from the main base and attacked through the North Vietnamese, pushing them into supporting tank and artillery fire. By 11:00 the battle was over, Company A had lost 24 dead and 27 wounded, while 150 North Vietnamese <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> around the position which was then abandoned.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{occupation}} of Pabu, and the general movement of Australian forces towards Wareo–Bonga, the Japanese infantry were threatened with being trapped. In response, the Japanese commander, Katagiri, diverted some of the effort away from the recapture of Finschhafen, and resolved to recapture the North Hill–Pabu area. A strong force of Japanese subsequently advanced south along the coastal track from Bonga, attempting to retake North Hill and the ground north of the Song River. Commencing on 22 November, the Japanese made heavy assaults around North Hill, on positions which were defended by Australians from the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion and the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion. The 2/32nd, with two companies isolated to the north around Pabu, was also {{in the thick of the}} fighting, and over the space of 10 days it was subjected to repeated attacks. Despite being short of food and receiving repeated mortar fire, the 2/32nd held its ground with the assistance of strong artillery support, and in doing so inflicted heavy casualties upon the Japanese. Later at least 195 <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> around the 2/32nd's position; their own losses amounted to 25 killed and 51 wounded. The Japanese commanding general, Hatazo Adachi, later pinpointed the Australian capture of Pabu Hill as one of the main reasons for the defeat of his force during the Huon Peninsula campaign.|$|E

5|$|Late on {{the evening}} of 17/18 February the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army {{launched}} an assault on FSB Andersen. The first attack was preceded by a heavy rocket and mortar barrage {{in the early hours of}} the morning, followed by two waves of infantry each of company size. The attack focused on the south-west of the perimeter manned by 3 RAR's echelon and mortar platoon, as well as an American medium artillery battery. The perimeter wire was subsequently breached, but the attack was repulsed by mortar counter-battery fire, Claymore mines and the heavy weight of machine-gun fire from armoured personnel carriers and the American gunners. The communist barrage had had a devastating effect, falling among the American and New Zealand gun positions, the mortar lines and the battalion echelon, as well as scoring a direct hit on an Australian engineer standing patrol. A second attack shortly after, this time from the north, was repelled by small-arms fire from the forward Australian pits. Total Viet Cong casualties were unknown, although four <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> on the wire at dawn, while numerous bloodstains and bandages were found during a later sweep of the perimeter and a suspected mortar base-plate location. Seven Australians and one American were killed, while 22 Australians and three Americans were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Nancy's first landfall, typhoon {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{for much of}} Luzon and many residents left for shelter. The typhoon passed through 10provinces in the Philippines, resulting in widespread destruction. Damage was the worst in Cagayan and Isabela, where 56people were hurt. In the former, 4,378 dwellings were destroyed. In Isabela, 2,250houses were destroyed, displacing 35,744residents. Along a river in Isabela, ten <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found.</b> Elsewhere, 800homes were destroyed in Tuguegarao, leaving 1,000homeless and two injured. In Kalinga-Apayao, four fatalities occurred. Throughout the nation, many roads were closed due to mudslides. There was significant destruction across rice fields, as well as tobacco and cotton plantations. The typhoon caused $56million (1982USD) in damage, which included $18million from infrastructure and $26million from agriculture. A total of 96people died; 81 of the fatalities occurred in three provinces. Most of the deaths were by drowning. Thirty others were rendered as missing and 186people were injured. A total of 12,464dwellings were destroyed while 34,111others were damaged. Furthermore, 301,431people, or 51,532families sought shelter due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|A third ship, the Manantico also {{crashed into}} shore {{due to a}} {{combination}} of the storm and human error in which the captain confused Cape Henry with Cape Charles after spotting another schooner. The Manantico was also where the two deaths associated with the storm occurred. The first was when a cook on the ship was crushed to death by the cargo of lumber being hauled by the ship. The ship was then pushed towards a sand bar. The captain, who had stayed high on the starboard side for safety, began climbing down to slip the ship cables, but the ship made a sudden stop. This flung the captain into the water, and he drowned. Both <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> after the storm and were very disfigured. The captain was sent to Middletown, Connecticut for interment while the body of the cook was buried on the beach. The final ship was the Harriet Thomas, which was the schooner spotted by the Manantico. After beaching, the crew managed to get a rope to shore where fishermen had tied the other end. The crew were able to climb ashore, although the captain had to be rescued via alternate means due to being too heavy for this method. The ship was written off as a $7000 (1887 USD) loss. Although all four ships were beached, due to the loss of communications, only one wreck – that of the Mary D. Cranmer – was reported in the Norfolk Virginian newspaper. As a result, news of the two deaths from the Manantico were initially unreported.|$|E
