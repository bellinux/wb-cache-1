40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{combined}} action of convection and pitch-angle diffusion {{is responsible for the}} formation of gas pressure distribution in the magnetosphere. Plasma pressure, in turn, determines - within the framework of a given magnetic field model - the density of <b>bulk</b> <b>currents</b> in the magnetosphere. With a knowledge of the <b>bulk</b> <b>currents</b> as a function of coordinates, we can calculate the field-aligned currents as a divergence of <b>bulk</b> <b>currents.</b> On the other hand, specifying the convection model is equivalent to specifying the electric field model. Since within the approximation of equipotential field lines the electric field is common to the magnetosphere and ionosphere, <b>bulk</b> <b>currents</b> and field-aligned currents in the ionosphere can be formally calculated subject to the condition that ionospheric conductivity is wholly determined by electron precipitation from the magnetosphere. The precipitation intensity is readily inferred from the same magnetospheric model. Thus we have two systems of field-aligned currents. One system is calculated from the model of plasma pressure distribution in the magnetosphere, and the other is inferred from a given model of the electric field and the electroconductivity model calculated from electron precipitation. This brings up the question: How can these two systems of field-aligned currents be reconciled? From previous studies it {{is known that}} magnetospheric convection "adjusts itself" to the level of energy losses in the ionosphere. Based on this, an attempt can be made to achieve a conjugation of the aforementioned two systems of field-aligned currents. This paper is devoted to analyzing such an attempt.

40|$|In {{preceding}} papers a Landauer-Buttiker type {{representation of}} <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> transport {{has been successfully}} used for the numerical simulation of the magneto transport of 2 -dimensional electron systems in the high magnetic field regime. In this paper it is demonstrated, that this representation is in full agreement with a treatment of the <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> transport as a tunneling process between magnetic bound states. Additionally we find a correspondence between our network representation and the <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> picture in terms of mixed phases mapped on a checkerboard: At half filled Landau level (LL) coupled droplets of a quantum Hall (QH) liquid phase and coupled droplets of an insulator phase phase exist at the same time, with each of them occupying half of the sample area. Removing a single electron from to such a QH liquid droplet at half filling completes the QH transition to the next higher QH plateau. Adding a single electron to such a droplet at half filling completes the QH transition to the previous lower QH plateau. As a consequence, the sharpness of the QH plateau transitions on the magnetic field axis depends on the typical size of the droplets, which {{can be understood as}} a measure of the disorder in the sample.

40|$|AbstractThe {{determination}} of the optimum force between a permanent magnet and a high temperature superconductor is studied in terms of frozen image model. The Amperian surface current assumption is assumed for the magnetization of the permanent magnet in the force calculation. The modeling is incorporated with the magnetic configurations of the magnet-superconductor system, such as vertical force for different cooling procedures. In the optimization study, the Amperian <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> assumption is introduced to the force calculation. Comparing the theoretical results obtained from both assumptions with the experimental {{results showed that the}} force estimation is better with the <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> assumption than that of the surface current. The results indicate that this improvement in the calculation of the force between the superconductor and permanent magnet is useful for larger geometries such as superconducting energy storage systems...|$|E

40|$|A {{combined}} {{action of}} plasma convection and pitch-angle diffusion of electrons and protons {{leads to the}} formation of plasma pressure distribution in the magnetosphere on the night side, and, as it is known, steady electric <b>bulk</b> <b>currents</b> are connected to distribution of gas pressure. The divergence of these <b>bulk</b> <b>currents</b> brings about a spatial distribution of field-aligned currents, i. e. magnetospheric sources of ionospheric current. The projection (mapping) of the plasma pressure relief onto the ionosphere corresponds to the form and position of the auroral oval. This projection, like the real oval, executes a motion with a change of the convection electric field, and expands with an enhancement of the field. Knowing the distribution (3 D) of the plasma pressure we can determine the places of MHD-compressor and MHD-generators location in the magnetosphere. Unfortunately, direct observations of plasma distribution in the magnetosphere are faced with large difficulties, because pressure must be known everywhere in the plasma sheet at high resolution, which in situ satellites have been unable to provide. Modeling of distribution of plasma pressure (on ~ 3 - 12 Re) is very important, because the data from multisatellite magnetospheric missions for these purposes would be a very expensive project...|$|R

40|$|Radiated {{emissions}} and susceptibility requirements imposed in bands where intentional RF reception or transmission {{does not occur}} is problematical. It is often desired to compare radiated emissions with radiated susceptibility performance to assess system level compatibility. For reasons purely theoretical and because of practical measurement limitations, this not realistic. McCollum and Clark proposed a limit and test method that provided a direct comparison of radiated {{emissions and}} radiated susceptibility performance in those cases where only unintentional emissions and reception are of interest (non-tunable electronics). This test method, referred to as <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> emissions (BCE) testing, and its associated limit is a complementary test method to <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> injection testing and radiated susceptibility testing. Previous work utilized victim and culprit circuits with low common-mode loop impedance.

40|$|Noise in CdZnTe devices with {{different}} electrode configurations was investigated. Measurements on devices with guard-ring electrode structures showed that surface leakage current {{does not produce}} any significant noise. The parallel white noise component of the devices appeared to be generated by the <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> alone, even though the surface current was substantially higher. This implies that reducing the surface leakage current of a CdZnTe detector may not necessarily result in a significant improvement in noise performance. The noise generated by the <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> is also observed to be below full shot noise. This partial suppression of shot noise {{may be the result}} of Coulomb interaction between carriers or carrier trapping. Devices with coplanar strip electrodes were observed to produce a 1 /f noise term at the preamplifier output.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the drain current modulation of a single-drain normal-gate n channel metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (n-MOSFET) under an on-chip magnetic field. A single-drain n-MOSFET has been fabricated and placed {{in the center of a}} square-shaped metal loop which generates the on-chip magnetic field. The proposed device designed is much smaller in size with respect to the metal loop, which ensures that the generated magnetic field is approximately uniform. The change of drain current and change of <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> per micron device width has been measured. The result shows that the difference drain current is about 145 µA for the maximum applied magnetic field. Such changes occur from the applied Lorentz force to push out the carriers from the channel. Based on the drain current difference, the change in effective mobility has been detected up to 4. 227 %. Furthermore, a detailed investigation reveals that the device behavior is quite different in subthreshold and saturation region. A change of 50. 24 µA <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> has also been measured.
