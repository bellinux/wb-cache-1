5|$|Forti {{produced}} a new chassis, the FG03, {{for the next}} race {{of the season in}} Imola. It had been designed by the same personnel as the previous year, with further work carried out by George Ryton after the latter moved to the team from Ferrari and took up the post of Technical Director mid-season. Both drivers judged it a significant improvement over the old car, with increased aerodynamic downforce and directional sensitivity, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> one FG03 available, and Montermini failed to qualify in the old car. Badoer, however, qualified last, but comfortably within the 107% cut-off, and only 0.7s behind Ricardo Rosset in the Footwork. Badoer finished 10th and last, but had suffered reliability problems in the new car and was two laps behind Pedro Lamy's Minardi. Both drivers qualified in Monaco, but Montermini crashed in the wet warm-up session and did not start the race, whilst Badoer struggled in the slippery conditions and took out Jacques Villeneuve as he was being lapped by the Williams. He was fined $5000 and received a two-race suspended ban.|$|E

25|$|The final {{difficulty}} was {{the great}} parade of knights {{that was supposed to}} open the tournament at noon. The knights had had little practice mounting their horses and {{took a long time to}} get prepared. Then each knight and his entourage (forty different groups) was supposed to ride to the castle, pick up a lady, officer or knight, and return to the lists. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> one drive to and from the castle, so that the knights had to jostle back and forth past and through each other. There had been no arrangement for parade control, and the knightly gridlock took hours longer to unfold than had been planned. By the time the parade was ready, it was a half mile long and over three hours late.|$|E

25|$|Kubiak, who {{was playing}} in his last NFL game before retiring, started out the Broncos next drive with an 11-yard {{scramble}} and then a completion to Johnson at midfield. Another completion to Johnson moved {{the ball to the}} 43, and then Mark Jackson caught a pass for a first down at the Bills 39. Following an encroachment penalty and an incompletion, Johnson made a spinning mid air catch on the Bills 10-yard line. Then after Johnson hauled in his fourth reception of the drive, Kubiak finished the 8-play. 85-yard drive with a 3-yard touchdown run on a quarterback draw, cutting the score to 10–7 with less than two minutes left. Denver defensive back Steve Atwater then recovered the ensuing onside kick on the Broncos 49-yard line, but on the next play defensive back Kirby Jackson forced and recovered a fumble from Sewell with 1:28 left. Denver forced Buffalo to punt, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> 17 seconds left when they started their drive from the Broncos 20-yard line. Kubiak completed two passes to move his team near midfield. However, second play ended inbounds and the clock ran out.|$|E

In the 1916 Battle of Jutland, the British and German navies clashed with no decisive result. The term [...] "dreadnought" [...] gradually dropped from use after World War I, especially after the Washington Naval Treaty, as virtually all remaining battleships shared dreadnought characteristics; the term {{can also be used}} to describe battlecruisers, the other type of ship resulting from the dreadnought revolution.|$|E
500|$|Bruce Catton wrote, [...] "The town of Gettysburg {{looked as}} if some {{universal}} moving day had been interrupted by catastrophe." [...] <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> one documented civilian death during the battle: Ginnie Wade (also widely known as Jennie), 20 years old, {{was hit by a}} stray bullet that passed through her kitchen in town while she was making bread. [...] Another notable civilian casualty was John L. Burns, a 69-year old veteran of the War of 1812 who walked to the front lines {{on the first day of}} battle and participated in heavy combat as a volunteer, receiving numerous wounds in the process. Despite his age and injuries, Burns survived the battle and lived until 1872. Nearly 8,000 had been killed outright; these bodies, lying in the hot summer sun, needed to be buried quickly. Over 3,000 horse carcasses were burned in a series of piles south of town; townsfolk became violently ill from the stench. [...] Meanwhile, the town of Gettysburg, with its population of just 2,400, found itself tasked with taking care of 14,000 wounded Union troops and an additional 8,000 Confederate prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the days}} that {{followed}} Meredith chose to move further south where the birds were [...] "reported to be fairly tame", <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> limited success in spite of his efforts. By the fourth day of the campaign, army observers noted that [...] "each pack seems to have its own leader now - a big black-plumed bird which stands fully six feet high and keeps watch while his mates carry out their work of destruction and warns them of our approach." [...] At one stage Meredith {{even went so far as}} to mount one of the guns on a truck: a move that proved to be ineffective, as the truck was unable to gain on the birds, and the ride was so rough that the gunner was unable to fire any shots. By 8 November, six days after the first engagement, 2,500 rounds of ammunition had been fired. The number of birds killed is uncertain: one account claims just 50 birds, but other accounts range from 200 to 500—the latter figure being provided by the settlers. Meredith's official report noted that his men had suffered no casualties.|$|E

2500|$|The new {{scoring system}} saw six points given for a goal and one {{point for a}} behind. [...] This system is still used. [...] (Between 1878 and 1896, kicks between the kick off posts [...] were {{recorded}} but did not count towards the score). [...] The main advantage in the now long-established, present system is that it cuts down the number of draws [...] [...] However, the current system does reward inaccurate kicking [...] [...] The first game {{that would have been}} a draw under the old scoring method, but achieved a result under the new system was in Round 4 of 1897: South Melbourne 5.11 (41) d. Collingwood 5.3 (33). [...] Later in that same season there were two games where the new system completely reversed the results, the first of these was in Round 12: Collingwood 3.17 (35) d. Fitzroy 4.4. (28). The advantage in the new system is highlighted by the fact that in 1896 the VFA had nine drawn games in one season, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> one draw in the VFL's 1897 season.

In the second match against Sussex, Derbyshire had Sussex all out for 45 and then made 226 in reply. By the close of play on the first day Sussex had made 25 of their second innings total of [...] 211.
