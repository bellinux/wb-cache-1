25|$|<b>Bulk</b> <b>mail</b> is {{mail that}} is {{prepared}} for bulk mailing, often by presorting, and processing at reduced rates. It is often used in direct marketing and other advertising mail, although it has other uses as well. The senders of these messages sometimes purchase lists of addresses (which are sometimes targeted towards certain demographics) and then send letters advertising their product or service to all recipients. Other times, commercial solicitations are sent by local companies advertising local products, like a restaurant delivery service advertising to their delivery area or a retail store sending their weekly advertising circular to a general area. <b>Bulk</b> <b>mail</b> is also often sent to companies' existing subscriber bases, advertising new products or services.|$|E
25|$|The bulk of {{remaining}} commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as Ravn Alaska, PenAir, and Frontier Flying Service. The smallest {{towns and villages}} must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service {{can be attributed to}} the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes <b>bulk</b> <b>mail</b> delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.|$|E

50|$|According to The Spamhaus Project glossary, mass or <b>bulk</b> <b>mailing</b> is not spam {{if it is}} solicited. By {{accepting}} a dirty list (a list containing some addresses without the knowledge and agreement of their owners), an ESP puts its reputation in jeopardy, which may affect its ability to deliver messages.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{purpose-built}} express reefer {{emerged from}} the Erie Railroad Susquehanna Shops on August 1, 1886. By 1927, some 2,218 express cars traveled America's rails, and three years later that number rose to 3,264. In 1940, private rail lines began to build and operate their own reefers, the Railway Express Agency (REA) being by far the largest. In 1948, the REA roster (which would continue to expand into the 1950s) numbered approximately 1,800 cars, {{many of which were}} World War II [...] "troop sleepers" [...] modified for express refrigerated transport. By 1965, due to a decline in refrigerated traffic, many express reefers were leased to railroads for use as <b>bulk</b> <b>mail</b> carriers.|$|E

50|$|TMDA is an {{open-source}} {{software application}} {{designed to reduce}} the amount of junk email a user receives. TMDAâ€™s main difference from other anti-spam systems is the use of a controversial challenge/response system that <b>bulk</b> <b>mailing</b> machines and programs are either unwilling (to save bandwidth) or unable (due to lack of programming) to answer.|$|R
50|$|There is also {{a web-based}} service where a user can upload a {{document}} and a corresponding mailing list. The document {{can be sent to}} everyone on the mailing list. The web service currently only handles <b>bulk</b> <b>mailing</b> (where every letter is identical apart from the address), not true mail merge (where every letter is customised for each recipient).|$|R

5000|$|For example, the United States Postal Service (USPS) defines <b>bulk</b> <b>mail</b> broadly as [...] "quantities of mail {{prepared}} for mailing at reduced postage rates." [...] The preparation includes presorting and placing into containers by ZIP code. The containers, along with a manifest, are taken to an area in a post office called a bulk-mail-entry unit. The presorting {{and the use of}} containers allow highly automated mail processing, both in bulk and piecewise, in processing facilities called <b>bulk</b> <b>mail</b> centers (BMCs).|$|E

50|$|Label {{dispensers}} {{have many}} uses. Imagine how many items you purchase have labels, almost everything.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to collecting information, {{which is made}} available on a [...] "top 25" [...] list at periodic intervals, the project organizers also help various law enforcement agencies combat private and commercial unsolicited <b>bulk</b> <b>mailing</b> offenses and, overall, work {{to reduce the amount}} of spam being sent and received on the Internet.

50|$|It {{should be}} noted that the {{delivery}} rates cited above are largely academic. With <b>bulk</b> <b>mail</b> delivery, the true delivery rate is primarily determined by the receiver's mail receiving policies and by the sender's reputation.|$|E
25|$|The {{postage stamp}} afforded {{convenience}} {{for both the}} mailer and postal officials, more effectively recovered costs for the postal service, and ultimately resulted in a better, faster postal system. With the conveniences stamps offered, their use resulted in greatly increased mailings during the 19th and 20th centuries. Postage stamps during this era were the most popular way of paying for mail; however, {{by the end of}} the 20th century were rapidly being eclipsed by the use of metered postage and <b>bulk</b> <b>mailing</b> by businesses.|$|R
2500|$|The mail or post is {{a system}} for {{physically}} transporting postcards, letters, and parcels. A postal service can be private or public, though many governments place restrictions on private systems. Since the mid-19th century, national postal systems have generally been established as government monopolies with a fee on the article prepaid. Proof of payment is often {{in the form of}} adhesive postage stamps, but postage meters are also used for <b>bulk</b> <b>mailing.</b> Modern private postal systems are typically distinguished from national postal agencies by the names [...] "courier" [...] or [...] "delivery service".|$|R
50|$|Many {{businesses}} in the office supply industry have recently expanded into related markets for businesses like copy centers, which facilitate the creation and printing of business collateral such as business cards and stationery, plus printing and binding of high quality, high volume business and engineering documents. Some businesses also provide services for shipping, including packaging and <b>bulk</b> <b>mailing.</b> In addition, many retail chains sell related supplies beyond businesses and regularly market their stores as a center for school supplies with August and early September being a major retail period for back to school sales.|$|R
5000|$|Frea Speach: Spammers {{claim the}} right to {{distribute}} unsolicited <b>bulk</b> <b>mail</b> {{as part of their}} right to free speech under the United States' Constitution.

50|$|Although <b>bulk</b> <b>mail,</b> junk mail, and admail are, {{strictly}} speaking, not synonymous, {{the terms}} {{are used in}} common parlance to refer to unsolicited invitations delivered by mail (typically, but not invariably, at bulk rates) to homes and businesses.|$|E

5000|$|The mail or post is {{a system}} for {{physically}} transporting documents and other small packages; or, the postcards, letters, and parcels themselves.

50|$|The early 2000s saw {{the rise}} of Coding Accuracy Support System (CASS) address standardization. The CASS {{certification}} is offered to all software vendors and advertising mailers who want the United States Postal Services (USPS) to assess {{the quality of their}} address-standardizing software. The annually renewed CASS certification is based on delivery point codes, ZIP codes, and ZIP+4 codes. Adoption of a CASS certified software by software vendors allows them to receive discounts in <b>bulk</b> <b>mailing</b> and shipping costs. They can benefit from increased accuracy and efficiency in those bulk mailings, after having a certified database. In the early 2000s, geocoding platforms were also able to support multiple datasets.|$|R
5000|$|Besides VDP {{software}}, other {{software packages}} {{may be necessary}} for VDP print projects. Mailing software is necessary in the United States (United States Postal Service) and Canada {{to take advantage of}} reduced postage for <b>bulk</b> <b>mailing.</b> Used prior to the VDP print file creation, mailing software presorts and validates and generates bar codes for mailing addresses. Pieces can then be printed in the proper sequence for sorting by postal code. In Canada, Canada Post now offers a 'Machineable' [...] personalized mail category which does not require addresses to be sorted into any specific order before mailing; therefore reducing the need for specialized sorting software to obtain optimal postage rates.|$|R
