Baldassare Cossa was a Neapolitan nobleman who grew up in <b>Bologna.</b> Pope Boniface IX elevated Cossa to the Archdiocese of <b>Bologna</b> in 1396 and made him a cardinal in 1402. After the Council of Pisa in 1409, Cossa encouraged rebellion against Pope Gregory XII, who refused to resign.

5|$|Baggio {{subsequently}} {{transferred to}} <b>Bologna,</b> aiming {{to save the}} squad from relegation, and earn {{a place at the}} 1998 FIFA World Cup. Baggio refound his form with the club and had a dominant season, scoring a personal best of 22 goals in Serie A, as well as providing 6 assists, leading <b>Bologna</b> to an eighth-place finish, allowing them to qualify for the UEFA Intertoto Cup. Baggio was the highest scoring Italian in Serie A that season, and the third-highest goalscorer in Serie A. His performances earned him a place in Italy's 1998 World Cup squad. Baggio also led <b>Bologna</b> to the round of 16 in the Coppa Italia, where he scored one goal in three appearances. Although he rose to hero status amongst the fans, he had difficulties with his manager Renzo Ulivieri, in particular when he was left out of the starting 11 against Juventus. Ulivieri later denied ever having any difficulties with Baggio. At the beginning of the season, Baggio cut off his iconic ponytail, signifying his rebirth. Baggio was named as Bologna's captain for part of the season, before handing the armband to Giancarlo Marocchi. Baggio made his 300th Serie A appearance while at <b>Bologna,</b> in a 0–0 draw against Empoli on 11 January 1998. Baggio received nominations for both the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year due to his performances for <b>Bologna</b> and Italy that season. He was also nominated for the 1998 Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year and Serie A Footballer of the Year awards, losing out to Alessandro Del Piero and Ronaldo, respectively.|$|E

Some opera houses began their performances at midnight between 31 December 1913 and 1 January. The first authorized performance was staged at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona: it began at 10:30pm Barcelona time, {{which was an}} hour behind Bayreuth.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the major UEFA competitions, Manchester City have also played a number of first team fixtures in other, more minor multi-national competitions. As winners of the 1970 League Cup, Manchester City played against the Coppa Italia winners <b>Bologna</b> in the Anglo-Italian League Cup. The competition started the previous year, {{as a way of}} enabling 1969 League Cup winners Swindon Town to play European opposition. For the first leg in <b>Bologna,</b> the City team stayed over 100km (60 miles) away in the coastal resort of Rimini, and took a relaxed attitude to proceedings. City lost the match 1–0, and drew 2–2 at home, losing the competition.|$|E
5|$|Legal studies {{advanced}} {{during the}} 12th century. Both secular law and canon law, or ecclesiastical law, were {{studied in the}} High Middle Ages. Secular law, or Roman law, was advanced greatly by {{the discovery of the}} Corpus Juris Civilis in the 11th century, and by 1100 Roman law was being taught at <b>Bologna.</b> This led to the recording and standardisation of legal codes throughout Western Europe. Canon law was also studied, and around 1140 a monk named Gratian (fl. 12th century), a teacher at <b>Bologna,</b> wrote what became the standard text of canon law—the Decretum.|$|E

5000|$|Preliminary {{hearings}} {{were held}} in June 2009. The only survivor of the shooting identified Ramos as the shooter. In September 2009, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Douglas Largaespada, an alleged MS-13 member, claimed that Ramos killed the <b>Bolognas.</b> Marvin Medina, who was injured in a shooting hours before the <b>Bolognas</b> were shot, testified in court in exchange for prosecutorial immunity. He repeatedly denied knowing Ramos or other MS-13 gang members; prosecutors questioned Medina to determine whether Ramos was seeking retaliation for the shooting of Medina in killing the <b>Bolognas.</b> However, Medina could not explain why he was driving around the San Francisco Mission District for two hours {{the day before he}} was shot and why he called several people but not 911 after being shot. On June 24, Sergeant Mario Molina, a San Francisco police officer who was an expert on Latino gangs, testified that Ramos thought the <b>Bolognas</b> were rival Norteños gang members. San Francisco Superior Court Judge Teri Jackson ruled on June 29 that Ramos would stand trial for three counts of murder, and Ramos pleaded not guilty on July 13. According to Sgt. Molina, Ramos stated that his friend Wilfredo [...] "Flaco" [...] Reyesruano, whom police identified as a leader of MS-13, shot the <b>Bolognas.</b> San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris sought a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole rather than the death penalty should Ramos be convicted. Mayor Newsom supported Harris's decision.|$|R
5|$|After {{a lengthy}} {{absence from the}} {{national}} team, Baggio was called up by Cesare Maldini for a World Cup qualifying match against Poland on 30 April 1997; Baggio came off the bench and scored a goal in a 3–0 win.

5|$|As the war {{turned against}} the Austrians, the {{garrison}} in <b>Bologna</b> left {{early in the morning}} on 12 June 1859. By the end of the same day the papal colours flying in the squares had been replaced with the Italian green, white and red, the cardinal legate had left the city, and a group styling itself Bologna's provisional government had proclaimed its desire to join the Kingdom of Sardinia. <b>Bologna</b> was promptly incorporated as part of the province of Romagna. The Archbishop Michele Viale-Prelà attempted to persuade the citizenry not to co-operate with the new civil authorities, but had little success. One of the new order's first official acts was to introduce freedom of religion and make all citizens equal before the law. In November 1859 the governor Luigi Carlo Farini issued a proclamation abolishing the inquisition.|$|E
5|$|Feletti faced a court trial {{under the}} code of laws in effect in <b>Bologna</b> {{at the time of}} Edgardo's removal. Carboni {{proposed}} that even under the pontifical laws, the seizure was illegal—he reported that he had seen no evidence to support the friar's claim that he had acted following instructions from Rome, and that there was substantial evidence casting doubt on Morisi's account, but so far as he could see Feletti had done nothing to verify what she had said before ordering the child removed. After Feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted, saying he was putting his defence in the hands of God and the Virgin Mary, the experienced <b>Bologna</b> lawyer Francesco Jussi was appointed by the state to defend him.|$|E
