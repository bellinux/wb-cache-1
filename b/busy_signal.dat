25|$|DialIdol is {{both the}} name of a {{computer}} program for Microsoft Windows and its associated website that began tracking contestants during season four and sprang to prominence at the start of season five. The program allows users to automatically vote for the American Idol contestants of their choice using their PC's phone modem. The program then reports back to the main website, which keeps track of the results based on the percentage of calls for each contestant that result in a <b>busy</b> <b>signal.</b> Based on the data received, the website then predicts which contestants may be eliminated or may be in danger of being eliminated. As of May 25, 2006, its predictions for season five were 87% accurate.|$|E

5000|$|... a fast <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> (also called reorder tone or {{overflow}} busy tone) signifying {{that there}} is congestion in the telephone network, or possibly that the calling subscriber has delayed too long in dialling all the necessary digits. The fast <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> is generally {{twice as fast as}} the normal <b>busy</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ready and <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> tones were {{adjusted}} by {{the radio}} set's volume control. This resulted {{in situations where}} users got a <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> but could not hear it because the vehicle's siren was on or the patrol car windows were rolled down.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some parts}} of the United States when a line is busy an {{intercept}} message plays over a <b>busy</b> <b>signal,</b> then when the message finishes only the <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> continues. This was done ever since automatic ring back was introduced. Or the message would play once and then the <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> is played after the message. For example, the message would say: The number you have called is busy. If it becomes free in the next 30 minutes you will hear a special ring when a call can be attempted. Please hang up.|$|E
50|$|Some systems {{experience}} seasonal peaks. For example, a trunked {{system in}} an agricultural area used by crop harvesting crews may overload and experience <b>busy</b> <b>signals</b> during peaks in harvesting. A system {{used by a}} ski resort may overload on a holiday weekend. Disaster planning experts {{like to say that}} trunked system users are likely to hear <b>busy</b> <b>signals</b> for the first time when a disaster occurs. A major flood or earthquake is likely to generate a level of call traffic that loads the system to capacity.|$|R
50|$|Countries have {{different}} signaling tones {{that act as}} <b>busy</b> <b>signals,</b> in most cases consisting of a tone with equal on/off periods {{at a rate of}} between 60 and 120 interruptions per minute (i.p.m.).|$|R
5000|$|Maintenance {{practices}} {{also can}} affect quality. In some systems, the operator may remove one channel of a trunked system from service to perform repairs. In a heavily used system, this could cause <b>busy</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Busy</b> <b>signals</b> {{and other}} call {{rejections}} by the telephone network count as call failures. However, the {{inclusion in the}} ASR accounting of some failed calls varies in practical applications. This makes the ASR highly dependent on end-user action.

While more channels were needed to resolve provisioning problems, the city did not have sufficient loading to qualify for licensing of additional channels under Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules.

5000|$|In telecommunications, the Network Effectiveness Ratio (NER) {{measures}} {{the ability of}} a network to deliver a call to the called terminal. <b>Busy</b> <b>signals</b> and other call failure due to user behaviour are counted as [...] "successful call delivery" [...] for NER calculation purposes. Unlike ASR, NER excludes the effects of customer and terminal behaviour. NER is a measure of network quality defined by the ITU.|$|R
50|$|Internet faxing is {{a service}} that permits the sending and {{receiving}} of faxes using the Internet rather than the traditional {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN), also known as the plain old telephone service (POTS) or a traditional fax machine. Faxing online eliminates problems with traditional faxing, including connection issues, <b>busy</b> <b>signals</b> and loss of data. Internet faxes can be delivered to multiple email addresses and forwarded to multiple recipients rather than to one machine at a time.|$|R
