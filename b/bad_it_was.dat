Forrester had been previously been named executive producer to the series, {{before the start of}} the season. The episode was also directed by Bryan Cranston, the star of the AMC drama series, Breaking <b>Bad.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> initially announced he was going to guest direct an episode by cast member Rainn Wilson, via Twitter. Cranston had previously directed episodes from other comedy series, including Malcolm in the Middle and Modern Family. Entertainment Weekly later confirmed the episode title and its airdate.|$|E
500|$|September 10, {{the day of}} the hurricane, is also a {{national}} holiday for British Honduras, on which many locals gather in the streets to celebrate the defeat of Spanish conquerors by the British in 1798. It is widely believed that the hurricane struck without any warning, although some recent historians have disputed this. In his column for The Belize Times on September 5, 2004, Emory King claimed that Belizean authorities withheld continuous warnings from U.S. ships in the region of a possible hurricane strike on British Honduras so the festivities would not be interrupted. King cited as evidence a letter dated September 24, 1931, from a local radio operator to the Colonial Secretary in which the warnings were discussed, adding that [...] "perhaps none of [...] had ever been in a hurricane and didn't know exactly how <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be." [...] Additionally, there was also belief among residents of Belize City that the reefs would provide a barrier against large tidal waves.|$|E
500|$|Most {{reviews of}} the pilot were average, {{claiming}} that while it was not <b>bad,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not great either. Metacritic gave the episode a Metascore—a weighted average based on the impressions of a select 12 critical reviews—of 46, signifying mixed or average reviews. When compared to the original series, Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that the spin-off covered the same themes—family, friends, teen melodrama, relationships—but with more humor. Owen praised the compelling characters and the acting, and found the dialogue to be more clever than painful. Adam Buckman of the New York Post commented on the crude language used by the characters, and found there was nothing new that could have surprised him with watching the episode. Ray Richmond of The Hollywood Reporter found that despite The CW's decision not to send out screeners to critics, the pilot was [...] " [...] so horrible after all". Richmond praised the actors and writers, especially returning actor Garth, whom he found looked [...] "terrific" [...] and acted well.|$|E

Because Pixels {{is one of}} those bad movies that isn't just casually bad, or shoot-the-moon bad, or too-close-to-the-sun bad, or {{actually}} kind of delightfully <b>bad.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> tediously <b>bad.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> bafflingly <b>bad.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is,</b> in its $90 million budget and 104-minute run time, wastefully <b>bad.</b> <b>Its</b> badness seems to come not from failure in the classic sense—a goal set, and unachieved—but from something much worse: laziness. Ambivalence. A certain strain of cinematic nihilism". Peter Sobczynski, writing for RogerEbert.com, called the premise promising but the execution [...] "abysmal." ...|$|R

500|$|Although {{there is}} a fictional Marvel Comics {{character}} called Collector, Long did not base The Collector on him. While carrying Lawless with an electromagnet, The Collector says [...] "Care for a Rolo, sweet Xena?" [...] The reference was included because the writing staff were given free Rolos at the time. In The Collector's lair, several celebrities are seen stored in aluminized PET film bags. Some of these include The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and Tom Baker, who portrayed the fourth incarnation of the doctor in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. [...] "There are several Doctor Who actors but Tom Baker is the one we always go with" [...] Hauge explained in the episode's DVD commentary. Other captives include actress Yasmine Bleeth, Gilligan from the series Gilligan's Island and Spock and Seven of Nine from Star Trek. The segment also features the series' first reference to , when The Collector uses a mint-condition of Darth Maul's double-bladed lightsaber. Because the episode was written before the film's release, the writers did not know [...] "how <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> gonna be", in their view, and therefore did not include any [...] "obligatory shot" [...] at the film. As he dies, The Collector poses as Lorne Greene's character Commander Adama in the science fiction series Battlestar Galactica.|$|E

2500|$|Following his win in Hong Kong A Shin Hikari {{was off the}} racecourse for {{six months}} before being sent to France for the Prix d'Ispahan on 24 May. The race was run at Chantilly Racecourse as its usual venue, Longchamp, was being redeveloped. He was made the 7.4/1 fourth choice behind New Bay, Dariyan (Prix Ganay) and Vadamos (Prix du Muguet) whilst the other five runners {{included}} the Grand Prix de Paris winner Erupt. Racing on heavy ground he settled in second place behind Vadamos {{before going to the}} front 400 metres from the finish. He drew further and further away from his rivals in the straight and crossed the line ten lengths clear of Dariyan. After the race Sakaguchi said [...] "I had imagined he would jump to the front and lead the race, so I was surprised, but it was good judgement by Yutaka to run him a bit away from the rail where the ground was not as <b>bad.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> great to see that he could settle and race from second place, as well as win with that style. We can now proudly hold our heads high and go to England for the Royal Ascot meeting". Bookmakers responded by making the horse favourite for the Prince of Wales's Stakes. In the June 2016 edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings A Shin Hikari was rated the best horse in the world, three pounds ahead of California Chrome and Winx.|$|E
