5|$|As a child, Ted was {{frequently}} uprooted as {{his family moved}} among Bronxville, New York, Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, Palm Beach, Florida, and the Court of St. James's in London, England. His formal education started at Gibbs School, in Sloane Street, Kensington, London. He attended ten different schools {{by the age of}} eleven, with his education suffering as a result. Ted was an altar boy at the St. Joseph's Church and received his First Communion from Pope Pius XII in the Vatican at age seven. Ted spent sixth and seventh grades in the Fessenden School, where he was a mediocre student, and eighth grade at Cranwell Preparatory School; <b>both</b> <b>schools</b> were in Massachusetts. His parents were affectionate toward him as the youngest child, but also compared him unfavorably with his older brothers.|$|E

5|$|By the 1850s, New School Presbyterians in the North {{had moved}} to more {{moderate}} positions and reasserted a stronger Presbyterian identity. This was helped in 1852 when the Plan of Union between the New School Church and the Congregationalists was discontinued. Northern Presbyterian's of both the Old and New School participated in the Christian Commission that provided religious and social services to Union soldiers during the Civil War. Furthermore, <b>both</b> <b>schools</b> boldly proclaimed the righteousness of the Union cause and engaged in speculation {{about the role of}} a newly restored America in ushering in the millennium. This was, in effect, the Old School's repudiation of its teaching against involving the church in political affairs.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, the {{football}} team's 10–0 season {{culminated in a}} 28–13 victory over first-ranked Tennessee in the 1952 Sugar Bowl. Maryland's participation, however, was in violation of a Southern Conference resolution passed mid-season that banned participation in postseason bowl games. Byrd had Maryland accept the bowl invitation, despite Tatum's objections. The coach thought the threatened sanctions, which prevented Maryland from playing any Southern Conference games the following season, would severely disadvantage his team. In 1952, Maryland and Clemson, which had also violated the bowl game ban, were sanctioned, and the incident hastened the break-up of the Southern Conference and formation of the Atlantic Coast Conference, of which <b>both</b> <b>schools</b> were founding members.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the higher education programs, Unicamp is also responsible for running and funding two technical high schools, the Technical High School of Campinas (COTUCA) and the Technical High School of Limeira (COTIL). Cotuca was located for 50 years in a historical building {{near the center of}} the city built in 1918 which also housed Unicamp for a brief period before the current campus was built. In 2014 it was transferred to the main campus as the old building went through renovations. <b>Both</b> <b>schools</b> are amongst the best public high schools in the country, and are highly competitive, with admissions done through a selection exam open to middle-school students.|$|E

5|$|Maroon: The university's {{official}} color {{used to be}} magenta, {{one which}} was shared by Harvard University. Since it was confusing for the two schools to be wearing the same color during athletic competitions, the matter of which school could lay claim to magenta was to be settled {{through a series of}} baseball games. Fordham won the games, but Harvard reneged on its promise. <b>Both</b> <b>schools</b> continued to use the color until 1874, when the Fordham student government unanimously agreed to change to maroon. Maroon was chosen because it was not widely used at the time. Sometime later, Harvard stopped using magenta in favor of crimson.|$|E
5|$|McCoy led the Longhorns to a 35–7 road {{victory over}} the Kansas, {{ensuring}} their eighth consecutive season with ten or more wins per season. That is the longest active streak {{in the nation and}} it ties them with Miami (1985–92) for the second-longest streak of all-time. It was Colt McCoy's 30th career win, which tied him with Vince Young for the school record. McCoy completed 24 of 35 passing attempts (71%) for 255 yards and 2 touchdown passes. He was also the leading rusher for <b>both</b> <b>schools,</b> rushing for 78 yards and a touchdown. McCoy's two touchdown passes put him at 31 for the season, breaking his own school record.|$|E
5|$|The Anglican Church St Andrews {{has held}} {{services}} since the 1840s. For some time the town {{also had a}} Wesleyan Chapel. A private school opened in 1843 and a government one in the 1870s. By the late 1930s <b>both</b> <b>schools</b> had closed. Carrick hosts Agfest, the state's largest single event and one of Australia's largest agricultural field days. The 1848 Anglican church, 1833 hotel {{and a few other}} establishments serve the townspeople. A brewery, steam and water mill, butcher, schools and other hotels are all long since closed. Carrick has a long association with horse racing, starting prior to the race course's formation in 1848. For a time the town held the oldest horse race in Australia.
