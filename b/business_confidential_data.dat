CAIN model suggest maintaining the Confidentiality, Authenticity, Integrity and Non-repudiation (CAIN) of information. Oracle 8 i, 9 i and 11 g Databases support SQLJ framework allowing embedding of SQL statements in Java Programs and providing programmer friendly means {{to access the}} Oracle database. As cloud computing technology is becoming popular, SQLJ is considered as a flexible and user friendly language for developing distributed applications in grid architectures. SQLJ source codes are translated to java byte codes and decompilation is generation of source codes from intermediate byte codes. The intermediate SQLJ application byte codes are open to decompilation, allowing a malicious reader to forcefully decompile it for understanding <b>confidential</b> <b>business</b> logic or <b>data</b> from the codes. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, strong and cost effective techniques exist for Oracle Database security, but still data security techniques are lacking for client side applications, giving possibility for revelation of <b>confidential</b> <b>business</b> <b>data.</b> Data obfuscation is hiding the data in codes and we suggest enhancing the data security in SQLJ source codes by data hiding, to mitigate disclosure of <b>confidential</b> <b>business</b> <b>data,</b> especially integers in distributed applications.

40|$|What is {{the impact}} of {{time-varying}} business uncertainty on economic activity? Using (partly <b>confidential)</b> <b>business</b> survey <b>data</b> from the U. S. and Germany in structural VARs, we find that positive innovations to uncertainty lead to prolonged declines in economic activity. Their high-frequency impact is small. There is no evidence of the “wait-and-see”-effect – large declines of economic activity on impact and subsequent fast rebounds – that the recent literature associates with uncertainty shocks. Rather, positive innovations to business uncertainty have effects similar to negative business confidence innovations. Once we control for the low-frequency effect of uncertainty shocks, they have little statistically or economically significant impact. We argue that high uncertainty events are a mere epiphenomenon of bad economic times: recessions breed uncertainty...|$|R
50|$|The {{right to}} access public {{information}} in guaranteed by Article 34 of the Moldovan Constitution and is regulated by the Law on Access to Information which was adopted in 2000. The law establishes that information of public interest can be requested in writing or orally. Information can be consulted at the institution’s premises or can be received stored in an electronic support or in hardcopy. Viewing documents on the institution’s premises is free of charge, while reasonable fees can be charged {{for the cost of}} photocopying, transcribing, translating or delivering the documents. According to the law, documents of public interest must be provided within 15 working days, which can be extended of 5 days in case of request of large amount of documents. If the request is rejected, the applicant can exercise its right of appeal to the relevant courts, and if the court decides on behalf of the applicant, the law imposes penalties in form of fines to the government body which has violated the law. Exceptions justifying limitation to the disclosure regime are specified in the law and include state secrets, information on the military, intelligence, economic, foreign policy or criminal proceedings, information concerning ongoing lawsuit, personal <b>data,</b> <b>confidential</b> <b>business</b> <b>data,</b> and preliminary results of scientific and technical research.|$|R

In general, the common approach to protect the <b>confidential</b> <b>data</b> of the QR code is using the back-end database [8]. The QR data only provides the database website link, such as uniform resource locator (URL). An authorized user can login to the database via linking the URL and then achieves the <b>confidential</b> <b>data.</b> Such a mechanism, however, needs to maintain the database, the access control, and the online requirement. The online decoded, moreover, may expose the risks of database attacks.|$|R
40|$|Achieving {{the maximum}} {{protection}} for <b>confidential</b> <b>data</b> {{is the ultimate}} goal pursued by all organizations. This leads to a continuous and rapid development of security controls, which includes managerial procedures and technical solutions. One of the newest additions to the security technical solutions is DLPSs. Equipped with context and content analysis capabilities, DLPSs can perform detection and prevention tasks with high efficiency. However, the performance of these systems can be significantly affected if the DLP lacks {{an understanding of the}} organisation's structure and if the processed <b>confidential</b> <b>data</b> are unstructured. In this paper, we present a DLP method to discover potential data leaks in organisations' email communications. The method is based on a combination of context and content analysis, which provides a better understanding of organisations' flow of <b>confidential</b> <b>data.</b> First, we use contextual analysis to measure an RAI. This is done by calculating five context components in an email communication. Second, we use content semantics analysis to detect <b>confidential</b> <b>data</b> leaks to high RAI users. The experimental results revealed potential <b>confidential</b> <b>data</b> leaks among selected test subjects. All the experiments were conducted using Enron dataset which includes about 0. 5 M emails of 150 Enron employees.

In particular, our method replaces the existing data with more generalized ones {{in such a way that}} the value replacement cannot be used to predict the <b>confidential</b> <b>data.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Using noise multiplied <b>data</b> {{to protect}} <b>confidential</b> <b>data</b> has {{recently}} drawn some attention. Understanding the probability {{property of the}} underlying <b>confidential</b> <b>data</b> based on their masked data is of interest in <b>confidential</b> <b>data</b> analysis. This paper proposes the approach of sample-moment-based density approximant based on noise multiplied data and provides a new manner for approximating the density function of the underlying <b>confidential</b> <b>data</b> without accessing the original data. The approach of sample-moment-based density approximant {{is an extension of}} the approach of moment-based density approximant, which is mathematically equivalent to traditional orthogonal polynomials ap- proaches to the probability density function (Provost, 2005). This paper shows that, regardless of a negligible probability, a moment-based density approximant can be well approximated by its sample-moment-based approximant if the size of the sample used in the evaluation is reasonable large. Consequently, a density function can be reasonably approximated by its sample-moment-based density approximant. This paper focuses on the properties and the performance of the approach of the sample-moment-based density approximant based on noise multiplied data. Due to the restriction on the number of pages, some technical issues on implementing the approach proposed in practice will be discussed in another paper...|$|R

It {{is essential to}} protect the <b>confidential</b> <b>data</b> from unauthorized access. In this paper, we analyze the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). To provide {{the security of the}} Military <b>confidential</b> <b>data</b> we use encryption algorithm which take over reward of superior encryption algorithm. The proposed implementation using encryption algorithm was implemented on ARM 7 to encrypt and decrypt the <b>confidential</b> <b>data</b> on data storage devices such as SD card or Pen drive. The main objective of proposed implementation is to provide protection for storage devices. The ARM and encryption algorithm protect the data accessibility, reliability and privacy successfully. Since (AES) Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm is widely used in an embedded system or fixed organization. These AES algorithms are used for proper designs in defense for security. The AES algorithm is a block cipher that can encrypt and decrypt digital information...|$|R

With fully synthetic data or redacted outputs, the analyst never really knows how much to trust the resulting findings.
