40|$|In broader terms, {{the paper}} {{refers to the}} topic of <b>brownfield</b> <b>regeneration,</b> {{as one of the most}} complex {{mechanisms}} for sustainable spatial development. In addition to the fact that <b>brownfield</b> <b>regeneration</b> demands a variety of instruments, such as: tax subsidies, the change of land use ownership, soil remediation, planning regulative amendments, etc., the complexity of <b>brownfield</b> <b>regeneration</b> is primarily seen in a number of stakeholders participating in such a process. Thus, the paper focuses on the social aspect of <b>brownfield</b> <b>regeneration</b> - precisely, on researching the community role and reviewing the possibilities for achieving the 'local' interests in complex developmental processes. The main research hypothesis is that <b>brownfield</b> <b>regeneration</b> positively affects the creation of and strengthening the social cohesion in the areas close to the brownfield site. More precisley, the paper presents the ways towards strenghtening social cohesion in the initial phase of the <b>brownfield</b> <b>regeneration</b> process, as well as the effects of such a process in its operationalisation phase on social cohesion. The thesis is examined by two main parameters: 1) participation of local community, and 2) social costs and benefits of <b>brownfield</b> <b>regeneration</b> versus greenfield investment. The research results are presented in the form of argumentative essay. In fact, the critical overview of arguments for and against the main research hypothesis is provided based on the review of interdisciplinary literature in the domain of <b>brownfield</b> <b>regeneration.</b> Such research organisation ensures the identification and description of the measures needed for strengthening social cohesion, as an utmost goal of this research.

However, as the research proceeds on the assumption that successful <b>brownfield</b> <b>regeneration</b> requires the active cooperation of different sectors and disciplines, there are several specific research objectives. Firstly, it is important to elucidate the nature of cooperation between the sectors at the same level, but also between different levels of spatial development. Furthermore, it is interesting to examine if there are specific institutions solely responsible for <b>brownfield</b> <b>regeneration.</b> Thus, the focus of the analysis will be directed to the institutional representatives (at different levels of spatial development) − their roles, responsibilities and limitations regarding the problem of <b>brownfield</b> <b>regeneration.</b> Also, documents relating to <b>brownfield</b> <b>regeneration</b> − laws, strategies, plans, concepts and spatial development programmes will be clarified. Proposed analytical strategy will shed light on the degree of integration between different sectors, disciplines and institutions within the same organisational level, tending to determine the extent of the so-called horizontal collaboration. In addition, the analysis elucidates the vertical collaboration between relevant institutions at national, regional and local level. Furthermore, it provides insight into the position of expert agencies within a certain institutional context.

If the residents attract some attention in this matter, it is most often at global level, and no influence of responders’ characteristics or of place of questioning on the perception of problems of brownfields is examined in more detail. However, there is a consensus among researchers that these variables have an immediate effect on perception. That is why we set the objective {{to assess the impact of}} inhabitants’ characteristics and of the place of residence on the structure of preferences for various types of <b>brownfields</b> <b>regeneration.</b> Respondents were questioned in three zones (city center, vicinity of the city and the peripheral surroundings of the city) of two cities (497 respondents in Karviná and 833 respondents in České Budějovice, both Czech Republic). Socio-economic characteristics of the respondents were pursued and respondents commented on the extent of agreement with the use of existing brownfields in three defined zones of cities. The impact of origin of the resident (geographic characteristics) and of the character of the respondent (soci-economic characteristics) on a structure in preferences was studied sequentially by means of three methods of multidimensional data analysis (PCA, RDA, and Variation Partitioning). All methods led us to reveal a structure of four factors of preferences for regeneration: green/sport, housing/shopping, industry, and entertainment. Following the RDA the statistically significant variables to influence the structure of answers are both geographical variables – city, zone of a city – and three socio-economic variables – gender, age, and education. Preference for commercial-residential use of brownfields has a distinctive centre-periphery distribution within the city. The preferences of the revitalization through the reactivation of the industry are given primarily by the particular city, and the impact of both types of variables (characteristics of the respondent and the place of questioning) is significant, however the shared explainable variation is negligible (geographic variables explain 51. 6 % and characteristics of respondents 46. 6 %) ...|$|R

As sustainability {{can be considered as}} one of the key paradigm of planning guidance and policies since the last fifteen years, changeability can be used to describe the regeneration of derelict spaces, in other words, brownfield lands. Therefore, the convergence between changeability and sustainable development may appear as obvious as both relate to the perspective of implementing a more compact city.

40|$|Many European governments place strong {{emphasis}} on integrated land use policies, particularly the re-establishment of public open access greenspaces through <b>brownfield</b> land <b>regeneration.</b> The UK Government considers the <b>regeneration</b> of <b>brownfield</b> land a prime tool for the delivery of regional economic regeneration, neighbourhood renewal and international biodiversity commitments. A number of failed brownfield greening projects question both the sustainability of such undertakings and whether greenspaces are fulfilling the functions they were designed for. Reliance on developer-, funding body- and site owner-centric notions of success in project delivery evaluation, {{to the exclusion of}} social and environmental impacts, has failed to highlight revenue requirements for management and maintenance to maintain function and quality. Brownfield greening project aims and objectives can be characterised as inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes using the general organisational ‘logic’ framework model. Applying this framework to six UK case studies, this research demonstrated that most greenspace aims and objectives are in fact ‘outcomes’ delivered in the medium and long terms following regeneration. The model is supportive of integrated, stakeholder inclusive monitoring over short, medium and long time periods. Physicochemical and social data from the case study sites were employed to present a comprehensive evaluation of site success. In each case, a lack of monitoring and evaluation – combined with insufficient supporting revenue funds – failed to highlight site issues, changes in local emphasis and ultimately a lack of success with respect to project aims and site sustainability. This research supports claims that capital funds to regenerate land must be supported by a revenue package for management and maintenance, that monitoring must be a funded activity; and, that monitoring and evaluation in support of the management cycle will promote the long-term sustainability, value and use of a greenspace...|$|R
40|$|Owing to {{the decline}} of urban ports-related activities, since the post-war period many European {{waterfront}} areas {{have been affected by}} obsolescence and degradation. Once vibrant seats of activities, flows of goods and people relationships, they have been gradually dismissed and abandoned, sometimes becoming 'no-go-areas'. Overwhelmed by deep structural changes, cities have been forced to face spatial, environmental and socio-economic problems. Yet, this necessity has often turned out as a significant opportunity of revival for some urban areas. In particular, brownfield redevelopment and waterfront revitalisation have been significantly pursued by British and Irish cities, which have creatively rediscovered neglected areas along water courses, changing them into landmarks for urban life and tourism/business attraction. The paper focuses on case studies of waterfront regeneration in Manchester, Belfast and Dublin, analysing them on the basis of indicators related to procedural, economic, socio-cultural and environmental issues.

40|$|Different {{definitions}} of risk too easily lead {{to differences in}} the type and level of risk accepted by varying stakeholders involved in the remediation process and redevelopment of contaminated sites as a whole. This can be rooted in the way risk information is interpreted and evaluated: technical risk definitions are largely evidential and based on engineering or technical contents, whereas social risk definitions are typically experiential and based on shared understanding and interpretation of information, including history and events. Brownfield redevelopments are characterised as high risk projects, due to potential onsite contamination, with some developers effectively redlining such sites. Yet, the Sustainable Urban <b>Brownfield</b> <b>Regeneration</b> Integrated Management (SUBRIM) Consortium identified that although contamination may be present on a site it {{may not always be}} the primary concern of the community affected by the redevelopment. It is argued here that risk is perceived by the public in a much more holistic, social way, which bears similar characteristics to the concept of sustainable development.

40|$|Recently, the UK {{government}} has focused increasingly {{on how best}} to bring brownfield land back into reuse for housing. Pressures caused by demographic changes, regional policies, and skewed economic growth together with the government's desire to pursue 'sustainable development ' policies, have increased demand for housing on brownfield land. Therefore, in the 'post-Barker ' world, the development's industry's role has come under close scrutiny.

Attitudes towards developing on contaminated sites also appear to have changed as developers have gained more experience of building on brownfield land.

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of the Brundtland Report, ‘sustainable development’ has become a popular yet contested concept among governments, international organisations and the private sector. To implement sustainable development, institutions attaining different objectives interpreted the definition in the Brundtland Report in various ways. These interpretations sometimes contradict each other. Brownfield land is the legacy of industrialisation and urbanisation. <b>Brownfield</b> <b>regeneration</b> has been considered a tool to rebuild sustainable communities. Similar to the concept of sustainable development, countries define the term brownfield land or ‘brownfields’ in different ways. Therefore, utilising <b>brownfield</b> <b>regeneration</b> to pursue sustainable development became an intricate matter. This study has developed a framework to define brownfield land {{to improve the quality of}} <b>brownfield</b> <b>regeneration</b> policymaking by analysing qualitative and quantitative evidence on the use of land and sustainability. The analyses of sustainability indexes revealed that the types of strategies applied by countries to achieve sustainability depend on their progress in development and on population density. At the same time, data also showed that the population density of a country influences the ways the term ‘brownfields’ is deinfed in the regenerating policies. Therefore, population density, as an indicator of development density, is a useful differentiator of brownfield definitions in the policies that may or may not lead to the successful regeneration. Furthermore, the concept of development densities may change based on the geographic scales of concern as well as the development of technologies that allow higher development densities without compromising the quality of life. Taiwan and England are both countries with high population densities. Preserving greenfield land and enhancing social capacities in the countries are important to maintain sustainability. However, the two countries perceive brownfield land at the opposite ends of the spectrum. England sees all previously developed land as brownfield land, while Taiwan considers ‘brownfields’ to be the result of industrial pollution. The textual analysis of parliamentary debate and news reports, in addition to the statistical analyses of land use, showed that neither definition has effectively tackled the issues of preserving greenfield land or improving social equality. In countries with higher development densities, to prevent further destruction of greenfields, and to increase the social capacities, the brownfield definition should help to focus regeneration efforts on the derelict urban land that requires interventions to bring back sustainable communities...|$|E
