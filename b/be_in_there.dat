5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
500|$|Arguably the {{highlight}} of the year was the defeat of the Centre Praying Colonels by a score of 24 to 0. It was Centre's first loss to a southern team since 1916. A story goes that tackle Bill Fincher sought to knock Centre quarterback [...] "Bo" [...] McMillin out of the game, taking with him brass-knuckles or [...] "something equally diabolical." [...] Before the game, Fincher said [...] "You're a great player Bo...I feel awful sorry about it because {{you are not going to}} <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> very longabout three minutes." ...|$|E
500|$|McMillin {{also had}} his only loss {{to a team}} from the South, to Georgia Tech by a 20–0 score. Tech tackle Bill Fincher {{reportedly}} tried to knock McMillin {{out of the game}} with brass knuckles or [...] "something equally diabolical." [...] Before the game, Fincher said [...] "You're a great player Bo...I feel awful sorry about it because {{you are not going to}} <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> very long—about three minutes." [...] The Atlanta Constitution reported, [...] "McMillin's forward passes outdid anything of the kind seen here in many years, but Tech seemed to know where they were going". According to one writer, [...] "Even the great [...] "Bo" [...] McMillin was powerless against the Tech players".|$|E

500|$|After the 1947 season ended, Indians owner Bill Veeck put Seerey on {{a strict}} diet and {{exercise}} regimen for the offseason, stating {{that he had to}} lose 35 pounds if he wanted to remain on the team. By the start of spring training, he had reached his goal of 195 pounds, and felt like he had an easier time swinging the baseball bat as a result. After a good month of spring training, Boudreau named him the starter in right field for the 1948 season, saying that [...] "he'll <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> until he stops hitting." [...] Shortly afterwards, Seerey was removed from the starting lineup, and he ended up playing 10 games for the Indians before being traded. On June 2, Seerey was traded with Al Gettel to the White Sox for Bob Kennedy due to his inconsistency as well as an overstocked group of outfielders on the roster.|$|E

I'll still <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> until all hours, and it's {{nice to be able to}} do that." [...] Lohan began writing lyrics for the album in June 2005, after the last single from her previous album had been released. [...] "I've been writing a lot, almost every night," [...] she said. [...] "There's been a lot going on , and I think people can find that escape in hobbies that they do. I don't do yoga or anything, but some people use that. Everyone has their own thing, and I use writing." [...] Initially titled There's Only One Angel In Heaven, the pop rock album features a darker theme when compared to Lohan's previous album, Speak (2004).|$|E

2500|$|On November 16, 1940, Caster was {{selected}} off waivers by the St. Louis Browns from Philadelphia. In 1941, Luke Sewell converted Caster into a relief pitcher, {{and he had}} the best seasons of his major league career as the Browns' lead reliever from 1942 to 1944. As a reliever, his Adjusted ERA+ ratings skyrocketed to 133, 159, and 150 between 1942 and 1944. [...] Caster later noted that he enjoyed the role of being a relief pitcher: [...] "I like to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> when the going is tough, trying to save a game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Using {{the same}} tactics they used in {{recording}} Jah Won't Pay the Bills, the band recorded its debut album 40oz. to Freedom in secrecy at the studios at California State University, Dominguez Hills. Nowell recalled, [...] "You weren't supposed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> after 9 p.m., but we'd go in at 9:30 and stay until 5 in the morning. We'd just {{hide from the}} security guards. They never knew we were there. We managed to get $30,000 worth of studio time for free". 40oz. to Freedom was released in 1992; 60,000 copies were sold.|$|E
2500|$|Following the game, Texas {{revealed}} that X-Rays, {{taken during the}} game, of McCoy's shoulder were negative. [...] His injury {{was described as a}} pinched nerve or stinger. [...] UT trainer Kenny Boyd explained why McCoy did not re-enter the game: [...] "After the injury, Colt experienced shoulder weakness and neck pain," [...] Boyd said. [...] "When evaluating injuries, we look for return of normal strength and a reduction of pain before putting a player back into the game. Colt wasn’t released to play because his symptoms, including strength, did not improve." [...] His mother, Debra McCoy, confirmed the nature of the injury and said that the extra time off prior to the game against Texas A should give Colt a chance to recover. Colt McCoy said in a statement, [...] "I'm really disappointed I wasn't able to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> helping my teammates, but I'm going to be fine. The off week couldn't come at a better time. I'll do everything it takes to get back." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{announced}} on 15 November 2009, that Benaud {{had signed a}} three-year contract with the Nine Network to continue being part of their cricket coverage until 2013, although his role would change from that of ball-by-ball commentary. Benaud said: [...] "I won't be doing live commentary any more." [...] Someone asked me, [...] "Does that mean you'll never again go into the commentary box?", [...] "Well, the answer to that", Benaud replied, [...] "If there is, as there always can be, some emergency or a sensational happening on or off the field {{where it would be}} quite ridiculous not to go into the commentary box, of course I'll <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> doing my job and doing it as professionally as I can. But I won't be on the live commentary roster. But I will be doing all sorts of, what I regard as, interesting things for Channel Nine on the cricket—special features on the cricket...". Richie commentated regularly during the 2011–12 season and was part of Nine's commentating team/roster.|$|E
2500|$|Heavy Rain {{director}} David Cage {{described the}} game as [...] "a very dark film noir thriller with mature themes" [...] without any supernatural elements, and that [...] "the real message [...] is about how far you're {{willing to go to}} save someone you love." [...] In 2008, Cage gave a brief overview of the game's narrative and ambitions: [...] "Heavy Rain is about normal people who have landed in extraordinary situations. I wanted a much more personal story. The first thing that came to my mind, as a father of two little boys, was that the main theme should simply be a father's love for his son. This is not a game about saving the princess or the world. Its [...] purely about a father's love. The main story will revolve around four different characters, and we're putting the spotlight on their perceptions. The question 'what is good and what is evil' is the key here, that will be just a matter of viewpoint...I believe heavily in moral choices, I'm going to use them A LOT. They're not about being good or bad, but about finding the right balance." [...] Cage commented on the setting by saying, [...] "I don't want to do a big free-roaming city like GTA, because the flow of the story will then be hard to control. Nevertheless, I do want to incorporate big sets, with a crowd, heavy populated areas like a mall and a subway are going to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> Of course, the gameplay has got to make use of that aspect too." [...] Cage also stated that the game's storyline and themes was heavily influenced by the 2006-2010 science fiction psychological thriller television series, Heroes.|$|E

The house would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> Pasture, orchard, cornfield, ragged and uncut, a grove of low trees with thick foliage, barns and corrals he noted with appreciative enthusiasm. The place did not have the bareness characteristic of a ranch.|$|E
