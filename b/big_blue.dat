Mulder chases the attacker into the woods and fires at it, revealing it to be an alligator. Mulder is disappointed that the killer ended up being an alligator and not <b>Big</b> <b>Blue.</b> As the agents leave, <b>Big</b> <b>Blue</b> swims nearby in the lake, unnoticed.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals possess active {{camouflage}} through {{their ability to}} change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling. For example, the <b>big</b> <b>blue</b> octopus, Octopus cyanea, hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.|$|E

5|$|The earthquake's {{epicenter}} lay near Manhattan, Kansas, a town {{just off}} the connection of the Kansas River and the <b>Big</b> <b>Blue</b> River. Nearby is the anticline Nemaha Ridge, which {{has been associated with}} at least a few earthquakes of Kansas. A 300‑million-year-old Precambrian granite range bounded by faults, it hosts the Humboldt Fault Zone, which, in addition to serving as the range's easternmost boundary, has produced {{a large portion of the}} state's earthquakes. Each year, it is responsible for at least several small tremors less than magnitude 2.7. It cuts through Permian rock, and according to the Geological Society of America, may actually be a complex fault. Previously, it was believed to be a simple, Precambrian structure.|$|E

25|$|As Price neared Kansas City, {{he learned}} that General Curtis' Army of the Border had {{assembled}} in and around Westport, and was blocking his way west. Furthermore, Pleasonton's cavalry division was pressing Price's rear, and was heavily engaged with elements of his force in Independence on the 22nd (see above). Price had nearly 500 wagons with him, and he required a good ford over the <b>Big</b> <b>Blue</b> River to facilitate the passage of his supplies. Byram's Ford was {{the best in the}} area, and thus became a strategic point during the fighting that was about to ensue around Westport. On October 22, Blunt's Union division held a defensive position on the <b>Big</b> <b>Blue</b> River's west bank. Around 10:00 a.m., parts of Shelby's division conducted a frontal attack on Blunt's men. This attack was a ruse because the rest of Shelby's men flanked Blunt's hasty defenses, forcing the Federals to retire to Westport. Price's wagon train and about 5,000 head of cattle then crossed the <b>Big</b> <b>Blue</b> River at Byram's Ford and headed south toward Little Santa Fe and temporary safety.|$|E
