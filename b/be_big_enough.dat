25|$|Starch {{granules}} {{are very}} common in chloroplasts, typically taking up 15% of the organelle's volume, though in some other plastids like amyloplasts, they can <b>be</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> to distort {{the shape of the}} organelle. Starch granules are simply accumulations of starch in the stroma, and are not bounded by a membrane.|$|E
25|$|Animal housing {{practical}} when collecting germplasms {{because they}} keep donor animals in an easily accessible area, making {{the process of}} collecting germplasms easier and more efficient. The species and breeds of animals housed should be considered while planning the facility; facilities should <b>be</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> to meet animal welfare standards, yet small enough to reduce human contact and increase ease of handling while reducing stress of the animal. As the process of collecting germplasm may take several days, the animal may become stressed causing a lower quality of genetic material to be obtained. Thus, training the animal {{to become familiar with}} the process is key. Holding facilities for animals may also serve as a quarantine. Quarantine facilities are necessary in order to prevent the transmission of disease from animal to animal, animal to germplasm, germplasm to germplasm, and germplasm to animal. Introducing quarantine to separate the diseased animal(s) from the healthy should be done immediately. However, a quarantine does not always prevent the spread of disease.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{producers}} {{always wanted to}} find the right stories to take advantage of being on location, Friends was never shot in New York. Bright felt that filming outside the studio made episodes less funny, even when shooting on the lot outside, and that the live audience {{was an integral part of}} the series. When the series was criticized for incorrectly depicting New York, with the financially struggling group of friends being able to afford huge apartments, Bright noted that the set had to <b>be</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> for the cameras, lighting, and [...] "for the audience to be able to see what's going on"; the apartments also needed to provide a place for the actors to execute the funny scripts. The fourth-season finale was shot on location in London because {{the producers}} were aware of the series' popularity in the UK. The scenes were shot in a studio with three audiences each made up of 500 people. These were the show's largest audiences throughout its run. The fifth-season finale, set in Las Vegas, was filmed at Warner Bros. Studios, although Bright met people who thought it was filmed on location.|$|E

2500|$|According to Anthony Cave Brown in Bodyguard of Lies, Haukelid {{concluded}} after a {{trial run}} that the explosives {{would be most}} effective if placed in the bow. If holed near the bow, the ship's screws and rudder would quickly be lifted out of the water, leaving the captain and crew without control. Haukelid also determined that [...] "he explosion had to <b>be</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> to sink the ship, but not so severe as to cause casualties among the passengers and crew." [...] He carried the bomb, made from eighteen pounds of Nobel 808 plastic explosive and two fuses fashioned from alarm clocks, on board in an old sack.|$|E
2500|$|Well-to-do hunters {{of the era}} were {{typically}} accompanied by a pack of hounds and several terriers, often running them both together. The hounds would scent and pursue the quarry and the terriers would [...] "go to ground" [...] or enter into the quarry's burrow and make the kill. Terriers were often the sporting dog of choice for the common man. Early sporting terriers needed to <b>be</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> to tackle the quarry, but not so big as {{to prevent them from}} maneuvering through the quarry's underground lair. As a result, these terriers had to have a very high degree of courage and pluck to face the foe in a tight, dark underground den without the help of human handlers.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, Alex Lamb, story {{producer}} for EastEnders, pitched a storyline that Kat would discover a son {{she did not}} know about, and it was hoped that Kat's search for her son would bring the character [...] "new purpose", but it was felt that Kat's search could not be confined to the setting of Albert Square, and a week of EastEnders episodes set in Spain was considered. Treadwell-Collins pitched the week of episodes to then-Controller of Drama, Ben Stephenson, but they realised that the story would <b>be</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> for its own series and Treadwell-Collins thought that Kat and Alfie [...] "could work in a whole new universe" [...] and that [...] "other characters and their stories could be created around them." [...] Originally the series was to be set in Spain, but Treadwell-Collins thought it was [...] "too obvious" [...] as the series needed to be [...] "fresh, different and to have soul." [...] Treadwell-Collins {{came up with the idea}} of setting the series in Ireland when he was on holiday in New Orleans on St Patrick's Day, and he saw people having fun but also claiming to be Irish. Treadwell-Collins realised that Ireland had not been portrayed in mainstream British television since the series Ballykissangel, and the Slater family's (of which Kat is a member) biography in EastEnders states that their origins are in Ireland, and with Wallace, Richie and Treadwell-Collins all having Irish backgrounds, Treadwell-Collins said that [...] "Ireland felt right".|$|E

2500|$|On 29 June {{the armed}} constabulary began arresting the ploughmen. Large squads pounced on the {{ploughing}} parties, who offered no resistance. Dozens a day were arrested, but their places were immediately taken by {{others who had}} travelled {{from as far away}} as Waikanae. Te Whiti directed that those of the greatest mana, or prestige, should be the first to put their hands to the ploughshares, so among the first arrested were the prominent figures Titokowaru, Te Iki and Matakatea. As Taranaki jails became full, ploughmen were sent to the Mt Cook barracks in Wellington. By August almost 200 prisoners had been taken. By then, however, the protest action seemed to be having some success, with Sheehan, the Native Minister, telling Parliament on 23 July: [...] "I was not aware ...what the exact position of those lands on the west coast was. It has only been made clear to us by the interruption of the surveys. It turns out that from the White Cliffs to Waitotara the whole country is strewn with unfulfilled promises." [...] A former Native Minister, Dr Daniel Pollen, also warned of the consequences of firmer government action against the Parihaka ploughmen: [...] "I warn my honourable friend that there are behind Te Whiti not two hundred men, but a great many times two hundred men." [...] All the prisons of New Zealand would not <b>be</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> to hold them, he warned.|$|E
