5|$|In December 1863, Bramlette {{addressed}} the General Assembly, {{declaring that the}} state had fulfilled its quota of soldiers for the Union army. January 4 of the following year, he proclaimed that rebel sympathizers would <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> all guerrilla raids in the state, and specified stiff fines and imprisonment for anyone found to be aiding the guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} {{provoked a}} response from {{both sides in the}} conflict. U.S. commanders broadcast radio messages and dropped leaflets demanding the senior North Korean commanders <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the atrocity. The North Korean commanders, concerned about the way their soldiers were treating prisoners of war, laid out stricter guidelines for handling enemy captives. Memorials were later constructed on Hill 303 by troops at nearby Camp Carroll, to honor the victims of the massacre.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested that the group could cross the brook, had meant that the school could not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the accident. It said that the failure of two teachers {{to meet up with}} the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E

5|$|Harlan, who had later {{directed}} the propaganda movie Kolberg (1945), {{was the only}} film director of the Third Reich {{to be charged with}} crimes against humanity. Harlan defended himself asserting that he had been neither Nazi nor antisemitic. He claimed that Goebbels had controlled his work and that he should not be held personally responsible for its content. He recounted the ways in which he had been forced to endure Goebbels' constant haranguing and meddling in the production of the film. In the end, the court condemned the film but exonerated the director. While Harlan had not acted nobly, the court recognized that he had operated under duress and should not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the content of the film.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Kronan {{was a hard}} {{blow for}} Sweden during the Scanian War. Besides being {{the largest and most}} heavily armed ship in the Swedish Navy, she had been an {{important}} status symbol for the monarchy of the young Charles XI. Along with Kronan, the navy lost a sizeable proportion of its best manpower, acting supreme commander Lorentz Creutz, numerous high-ranking fleet officers, and the chief of the navy medical staff. A commission was set up to investigate whether any individuals could <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the Swedish fiasco at the Battle of Öland and other major defeats during the war. Although no one was officially held accountable, Creutz has been blamed by many historians for the sinking of Kronan because of his naval and command inexperience. Recent research has provided a more nuanced picture, and points to Sweden's general lack of a well-developed naval organization and officer corps at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{case for}} Hess's defence was {{presented}} from 22–26 March by his lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl. He noted that while Hess accepted {{responsibility for the}} many decrees he had signed, he said these matters {{were part of the}} internal workings of a sovereign state and thus outside the purview of a war crimes trial. He called to the stand Ernst Wilhelm Bohle, the man who had been head of the NSDAP/AO, to testify on Hess's behalf. When Griffith-Jones presented questions about the organisation's spying in several countries, Bohle testified that any warlike activities such as espionage had been done without his permission or knowledge. Seidl called two other witnesses, former mayor of Stuttgart Karl Strölin and Hess's brother Alfred, both of whom refuted the allegations that the NSDAP/AO had been spying and fomenting war. Seidl presented a summation of the defence's case on 25 July, in which he attempted to refute the charge of conspiracy by pointing out that Hitler alone had made all the important decisions. He noted that Hess could not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> any events that took place after he left Germany in May 1941. Meanwhile, Hess mentally detached himself from what was happening, declining visits from his family and refusing to read the newspapers.|$|E

25|$|The {{interim report}} of Justice Jain Commission, which oversaw the {{investigation}} into Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, indicted Karunanidhi for abetting the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).

25|$|In 1972 the new Egyptian President Anwar Sadat {{expelled}} the Soviet advisers from Egypt.

25|$|Anti-nuclear {{activists are}} accused of {{encouraging}} radiophobic emotions among the public. The War Against the Atom (Basic Books, 1982) Samuel MacCracken of Boston University argued that in 1982, 50,000 deaths per year could be attributed directly to non-nuclear power plants, if fuel production and transportation, as well as pollution, were taken into account. He argued that if non-nuclear plants were judged by the same standards as nuclear ones, each US non-nuclear power plant could <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> about 100 deaths per year.|$|E

25|$|In a {{subsequent}} article for The New York Review of Books, Soros emphasized thatI do not {{subscribe to the}} myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community {{are influenced by the}} pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.|$|E
