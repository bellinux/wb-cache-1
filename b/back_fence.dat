5|$|The {{body was}} re-cremated during the funeral, but Đức's heart {{remained}} intact {{and did not}} burn. It {{was considered to be}} holy and placed in a glass chalice at Xá Lợi Pagoda. The intact heart relic is regarded as a symbol of compassion. Đức has subsequently been revered by Vietnamese Buddhists as a bodhisattva (Bồ Tát), and accordingly is often referred to in Vietnamese as Bồ Tát Thích Quảng Đức. On 21 August, the ARVN Special Forces of Nhu attacked Xá Lợi and other Buddhist pagodas across Vietnam. The secret police intended to confiscate Đức's ashes, but two monks had escaped with the urn, jumping over the <b>back</b> <b>fence</b> and finding safety at the U.S. Operations Mission next door. Nhu's men managed to confiscate Đức's charred heart.|$|E
25|$|A {{radial arm}} saw has a {{circular}} saw mounted on a sliding horizontal arm. In addition to making length cuts a {{radial arm saw}} may be configured with a dado blade to create cuts for dado, rabbet or half lap joints. Some radial arm saws allow the blade to be turned parallel to the <b>back</b> <b>fence</b> allowing a rip cut to be performed. In 1922, Raymond De Walt of Bridgeton, New Jersey invented the radial arm saw. A patent was applied for in 1923 and awarded to De Walt in 1925.|$|E
500|$|Pail toilets with {{municipal}} collection {{persisted in}} Australia {{well into the}} second half of the twentieth century. Brisbane, its third most populous city, relied on [...] "dunny carts" [...] until the 1950s (one source says until the 1970s); because the population was so dispersed, it was difficult to install sewerage. Tar, creosote, and disinfectant kept the smell down. Academic George Seddon claimed that [...] "the typical Australian back yard in the cities and country towns" [...] had, throughout the first half of the twentieth century, [...] "a dunny against the <b>back</b> <b>fence,</b> so that the pan could be collected from the dunny lane through a trap-door" ...|$|E
5000|$|Agritopia is a 166-acre {{mixed use}} planned {{community}} in Gilbert, Arizona {{designed to encourage}} agrarianism combined {{with a sense of}} community amongst the socioeconomic ranges. Homes ranging from 1300 square feet to 7,000 square feet reside next to each other, some with full basements and some without. Narrow streets and front porches, with low <b>back</b> <b>fences,</b> encourage neighborly socialization, and is reminiscent of the mid-west in the 1950s. The [...] "farm" [...] feel is evident throughout Agritopia.|$|R
6000|$|At 7:30 {{the couple}} {{in the next room}} began to quarrel: the man in the room above sought for A on his flute; the gas went a little lower; three coal wagons started to unload--the only sound of which the {{phonograph}} is jealous; cats on the <b>back</b> <b>fences</b> slowly retreated toward Mukden. By these signs Sarah knew {{that it was time for}} her to read. She got out [...] "The Cloister and the Hearth," [...] the best non-selling book of the month, settled her feet on her trunk, and began to wander with Gerard.|$|R

2500|$|This predates {{by three}} years the {{earliest}} use that [...] Paul Dickson found when researching his The Dickson Baseball Dictionary. In a 1930 Washington Post story, writer Brian Bell quoted Dan Howley, then {{manager of the}} Cincinnati Reds, defending the hitting prowess of Harry Heilmann, who was then finishing his career under Howley. [...] " [...] were real home runs", Howley said, pointing out how far from the field they had landed. [...] "They were not Chinese home runs in that short bleacher at right", referring to the <b>back</b> <b>fence</b> on the foul line at the Polo Grounds, a mere [...] from home.|$|E
2500|$|As had {{happened}} with Rhodes' home run four years earlier, the Chinese-themed joking around the short fence continued. The screen {{was called the}} [...] "Chinese screen" [...] or the [...] "Great Wall of China", and the Coliseum as a whole became known as [...] "O'Malley's Chinese Theatre", [...] "The House that Charlie Chan Built", or even, in one Willard Mullin cartoon, [...] "Flung Wong O'Malley's Little Joss House in Los Angeles". Even The Sporting News, bucking the preseason trend by editorializing {{it was too early}} to say whether the short wall would adversely affect the game, felt compelled to put on the cover of that issue (which also included Spink's etymological investigation) a cartoon showing an outsized Chinese coolie hanging over the Coliseum's <b>back</b> <b>fence.</b> The Chinese American community in the Los Angeles area made its objections known.|$|E
2500|$|In {{suburban}} areas {{not connected to}} the sewerage, outhouses were not always built over pits. Instead, these areas utilized a pail closet, where waste was collected into large cans positioned under the toilet seat, to be collected by contractors (or night soil collectors) hired by property owners or the local council. The used cans were replaced with empty, cleaned cans. Brisbane relied on [...] "dunny carts" [...] until the 1950s (one source says until the 1970s); because the population was so dispersed, {{it was difficult to}} install sewerage. Tar, creosote, and disinfectant kept the smell down. Academic George Seddon claimed that [...] "the typical Australian back yard in the cities and country towns" [...] had, throughout {{the first half of the}} twentieth century, [...] "a dunny against the <b>back</b> <b>fence,</b> so that the pan could be collected from the dunny lane through a trap-door" [...] The person who appeared weekly to empty the buckets beneath the seats was known as the [...] "dunnyman", see gong farmer.|$|E

50|$|Another {{significant}} {{location in}} Camperdown Park is the various rear walls and <b>back</b> <b>fences</b> {{of the buildings}} at {{the southern edge of}} the park that face onto Australia Street. A large continuous mural (above, centre) featuring many pictoral designs and elaborate tags, has been painted along the side wall of the large commercial building that faces the Courthouse Hotel, and most of the other fences and walls in this area of the park now have murals or decorative tags, although these have changed a number of times in recent years. The two examples above illustrate this—the mural second from right (photographed in March 2007) had been entirely painted over by July 2007 and replaced by the mural shown above, far right.|$|R
2500|$|As {{early as}} the late 19th century, the {{baseball}} community had recognized that parks with shorter distances to the foul poles and <b>back</b> <b>fence</b> allowed for home runs that were thought of as undeserved or unearned, since fly balls of the same distance hit closer to or in center field could easily result in outs when fielders caught them. In 1896 Jim Nolan of the Daily News of Galveston, Texas, reporting on {{the expansion of the}} local ballpark, wrote: [...] "The enlarged size of the grounds will enable the outfielders to cover more ground and take in fly balls that went for cheap home runs before. Batsmen will have to earn their triples and home runs hereafter". In 2010 Jonathan Lighter, a member of the American Dialect Society's listserv, found the earliest use of the term [...] "Chinese home run" [...] for that type of hit in a Charleroi, Pennsylvania, newspaper's account of a Philadelphia Phillies game against the Pittsburgh Pirates: [...] "The Phillies went into a deadlock on Cy's Chinese homer only to see the Buccos hammer over four runs a little later." ...|$|E
60|$|The next player up was a tall, lanky chap named Wilks. He swung savagely at {{the sphere}} as if {{intending}} to knock {{it over the}} <b>back</b> <b>fence.</b>|$|E

50|$|There {{are ongoing}} {{pressures}} on the sites from development. As a result of housing development along Reservoir Road, one ring is now encircled by the <b>back</b> <b>fences</b> of adjoining houses, while another is subject to residential subdivision plans which will also see it surrounded by roads. A past proposal even considered incorporating one of the rings {{in the middle of}} a traffic round-about. The Canterbury Hills housing estate has submitted plans for residential development around the Riddells Road ring. In October 2009, the Sunbury Maribyrnong Valley Green Wedge Defenders made a Submission to the Parliamentary, Legislative Council regarding their inquiry into the impact of the state government’s decision to change the Urban Growth Boundary, citing the Aboriginal ring as a significant element of the threatened Bundanoon woodlands and grasslands, which was being encroached upon by housing.|$|R
60|$|Back of {{the office}} were great piles of lumber, all thickly covered with snow. Among them could plainly be seen the {{footsteps}} of two people. The marks were fresh, and led along the <b>back</b> <b>fence</b> {{and then to the}} right.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{there goes}} the lion!" [...] cried Snap as {{the form of the}} animal arose swiftly in the air. With grace and {{precision}} the lord of the animal world cleared the <b>back</b> <b>fence</b> of the yard and crouched down in the street, close to a tree.|$|E
6000|$|... "No--no--I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly's awful {{particular}} about this fence--right {{here on the}} street, you know --but {{if it was the}} <b>back</b> <b>fence</b> I wouldn't mind and SHE wouldn't. Yes, she's awful {{particular about}} this fence; it's got to be done very careful; I reckon there ain't one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it the way it's got to be done." ...|$|E

60|$|When he came {{in sight}} of the cabin he could not tell whether he would rather have his mother waiting for him with a {{whipping}} and some supper, or get to bed somehow with neither. He climbed softly over the <b>back</b> <b>fence</b> and crept up to the back door, but it was fast; then he crept round to the front door, and that was fast, too. There was no light in the house, and it was perfectly still.|$|E
60|$|At first Ajor and So-al {{were like}} a couple of {{stranger}} cats on a <b>back</b> <b>fence</b> but soon they began to accept each other under something of an armed truce, and later became fast friends. So-al was a mighty fine-looking girl, built like a tigress as to strength and sinuosity, but withal sweet and womanly. Ajor and I came to be very fond of her, and she was, I think, equally fond of us. To-mar was very much of a man--a savage, if you will, but none the less a man.|$|E
6000|$|Unfortunately, 1601 has {{recently}} been tagged by Professor Edward Wagenknecht as [...] "the most famous piece of pornography in American literature." [...] Like many another uninformed, Prof. W. is like the little boy who is shocked to see [...] "naughty" [...] words chalked on the <b>back</b> <b>fence,</b> and thinks they are pornography. The initiated, after years of wading through the mire, will recognize instantly the significant difference between filthy filth and funny [...] "filth." [...] Dirt for dirt's sake is something else again. Pornography, an eminent American jurist has pointed out, is distinguished by the [...] "leer of the sensualist." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{a walk in}} {{the park}} all POW's {{gathered}} to be counted and be escorted back to the main castle. At this moment all guards, who stood around the park fences, also returned to the park entrance leaving the <b>back</b> <b>fences</b> unguarded. Mairesse Lebrun and Lieutenant Pierre Odry used this opportunity to leave the group, and together they ran to the fence at the backside of the park. Three meters in front of the fence, Odry cupped his hands together in which Mairesse Lebrun set his foot. Odry catapulted Mairesse Lebrun over the fence where he ran away. The German guards were so stunned that they did nothing initially, when they recovered they started shooting without success. Mairesse Lebrun climbed a wall successfully and was out in the open. Still in his sports clothes he hid in a field and via Switzerland reached Vichy France. In December 1941 he went to Spain where he got arrested. He tried to escape again but unfortunately fractured his spine paralysing his legs.|$|R
6000|$|The {{time was}} not long when Martin ceased patronizing the Japanese restaurants. At the very moment when he had {{abandoned}} the fight, the tide turned. But it had turned too late. Without a thrill he opened a thick envelope from The Millennium, scanned {{the face of a}} check that represented three hundred dollars, and noted that it was the payment on acceptance for [...] "Adventure." [...] Every debt he owed in the world, including the pawnshop, with its usurious interest, amounted to less than a hundred dollars. And when he had paid everything, and lifted the hundred-dollar note with Brissenden's lawyer, he still had over a hundred dollars in pocket. He ordered a suit of clothes from the tailor and ate his meals in the best cafes in town. He still slept in his little room at Maria's, but the sight of his new clothes caused the neighborhood children to cease from calling him [...] "hobo" [...] and [...] "tramp" [...] from the roofs of woodsheds and over <b>back</b> <b>fences.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Susan {{departed}} for Rainbow Valley, valiantly grasping a pitchfork which she found {{leaning against the}} <b>back</b> <b>fence</b> where the doctor had been working in his little hay-field. A pitchfork might not be of much use against [...] "ha'nts," [...] {{but it was a}} comforting sort of weapon. There was nothing to be seen in Rainbow Valley when Susan reached it. No white visitants appeared to be lurking in the shadowy, tangled old Bailey garden. Susan marched boldly through it and beyond it, and rapped with her pitchfork {{on the door of the}} little cottage on the other side, where Mrs. Stimson lived with her two daughters.|$|E
60|$|Alexina, {{not waiting}} {{to shut the}} oven door--for delay might impress Uncle James unfavourably--rushed upstairs to get the letter. She was ten minutes finding it. Then, remembering her pies, she flew back to the kitchen. In {{the middle of the}} floor she stopped as if transfixed, staring at the table. The turkey was gone. And the plum pudding was gone! And the mince pies were gone! Nothing was left but the platters! For a moment Alexina refused to believe her eyes. Then she saw a trail of greasy drops on the floor to the open door, out over the doorstep, and along the boards of the walk to the <b>back</b> <b>fence.</b>|$|E
60|$|The young tenant in {{the chair}} allowed these {{thoughts}} to file, soft-shod, through his mind, while there drifted into the room furnished sounds and furnished scents. He heard in one room a tittering and incontinent, slack laughter; in others the monologue of a scold, the rattling of dice, a lullaby, and one crying dully; above him a banjo tinkled with spirit. Doors banged somewhere; the elevated trains roared intermittently; a cat yowled miserably upon a <b>back</b> <b>fence.</b> And he breathed the breath of the house--a dank savour rather than a smell--a cold, musty effluvium as from underground vaults mingled with the reeking exhalations of linoleum and mildewed and rotten woodwork.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} <b>backs</b> {{the factory}} <b>fence</b> and {{is embedded in}} a meadow adorned with cherry trees. Claes Oldenburg's prominent sculpture Balancing Tools provides a colourful contrast, while Tadao Ando's nearby conference pavilion gives a more muted one.|$|R
