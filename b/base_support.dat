25|$|A wing is a {{formation}} intermediate between a command and a squadron. It generally {{consists of two}} or three IAF squadrons and helicopter units, along with forward <b>base</b> <b>support</b> units (FBSU). FBSUs do not have or host any squadrons or helicopter units but act as transit airbases for routine operations. In times of war, they can become fully fledged air bases playing host to various squadrons. In all, about 47 wings and 19 FBSUs make up the IAF. Wings are typically commanded by a group captain.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 2010 No. 27 Squadron's role {{expanded}} to include the provision of support services to RAAF Base Townsville when it was merged with No. 323 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron. This formed part of a reform across the RAAF in which the reserve squadrons were merged with local combat support units or expeditionary combat support squadrons {{with the goal of}} improving the provision of air <b>base</b> <b>support</b> services. Under the new arrangements the commander of No. 27 Squadron has also received the responsibilities of the senior Australian Defence Force officer at RAAF Base Townsvile.|$|E
25|$|While {{the wing}} gained IAAFA's {{technical}} training missions, it lost the officer training mission which AETC reassigned to Air University on 1 July 1993 and shortly thereafter moved to Maxwell AFB, Alabama. The wing also gained extensive technical training courses from two closing bases—Chanute AFB in Illinois and Lowry AFB in Colorado. The courses consisted {{of much of}} the Air Force's training for <b>base</b> <b>support</b> and operations. As the new courses began to come on line in 1993, the wing's technical trainee accessions grew significantly. In 1994, technical training entries almost reached 20,000, while basic military training remained at its pre-1986 level of about 35,000. In 1995, the wing reached near parity between basic military and technical training missions in terms of members trained.|$|E

25|$|Reactivated {{as a part}} of the Navy's {{expansion}} of its active fleet following the communist invasion of South Korea, the ship was recommissioned on 7 March 1951, with Lieutenant John W. Leonard, in command and operated with the Atlantic Fleet Amphibious Force until reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet Naval Air Force in April 1953. By September, she was operating out of Naples, Italy, serving as an advanced <b>base</b> <b>support</b> ship with Air Logistics Support Division 2. With the exception of occasional voyages to the United States for alterations and repairs, LST-32 operated in the Mediterranean Sea for the remainder of her active Navy career providing the 6th Fleet with the capability of establishing forward NATO air bases anywhere in the Mediterranean on short notice. On 1 July 1955, she received the name Alameda County.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, No.33 Squadron had been {{transferred}} to the recently re-established No.84 Wing, and AMTDU to No.85 Wing, while the <b>Base</b> <b>Support</b> Wing had been superseded by Combat Support Unit Richmond. No.36 Squadron, having transferred its C-130Hs to No.37 Squadron and re-equipped with the C-17 Globemaster, relocated to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, in November 2006. The RAAF's DHC-4 Caribous, which had been operated for some years by No.38 Squadron out of RAAF Base Townsville, were retired {{at the end of}} 2009, to be replaced by Super King Airs built by Hawker Pacific. No.37 Squadron was transferred from No.86 Wing to No.84 Wing on 1October 2010. In January 2013, No.35 Squadron was re-formed at Richmond, under the control of No. 84 Wing. Initially a cadre, the squadron will expand to approximately 250 personnel by 2015, when it will begin operating the RAAF's ten C-27J Spartan transport aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, the {{remainder}} of the former Naval Air Station Miami/Marine Corps Air Station Miami property, except for a portion reserved for the United States Coast Guard for establishment of a new coast guard air station, was transferred to Dade County and became Opa-locka Airport. However, events of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 led to much of the former air station again being requisitioned by the Department of Defense for use as an additional staging base for U.S. strike forces, augmenting the active duty air force bases and naval air stations in Florida in the event the crisis led to war. United States Air Force civil engineers from the Tactical Air Command (TAC) arrived at the airfield late in the evening of October 22 and proceeded to work around the clock. In one instance, TAC civil engineering personnel rehabilitated the aging petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) fuel farm and distribution infrastructure originally constructed by the Navy in the 1940s, bringing the facility to fully operational status in just 3½ days. Other airfield and air <b>base</b> <b>support</b> improvements were also implemented to support tactical aircraft operations. However, the crisis passed through diplomatic means and the airfield was never required to serve as a strike installation against Soviet and Cuban forces.|$|E

25|$|The wing was {{organized}} as the 4710th Defense Wing {{at the beginning}} of February 1952 at New Castle AFB, Delaware and assigned to Eastern Air Defense Force as part of a major reorganization of ADC responding to ADC's difficulty under the existing wing base organizational structure in deploying fighter squadrons to best advantage. It assumed operational control and the air defense mission of fighter squadrons formerly assigned to the inactivating Air National Guard (ANG) 113th Fighter-Interceptor Wing (FIW). The 142d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (FIS) was located at New Castle with the wing headquarters, the 148th FIS was a few miles away at Dover AFB, Delaware, and the 121st FIS was stationed at Andrews AFB, Maryland. All three squadrons flew radar equipped Lockheed F-94 Starfire interceptor aircraft. The 113th FIW had been called to active duty and moved to New Castle to replace elements of the 4th FIW which had deployed to Far East Air Force because of the Korean War. The wing's mission was to train and maintain tactical flying units in state of readiness in order to defend Northeast United States. The wing's 82nd Air Base Squadron assumed <b>base</b> <b>support</b> duties at New Castle from inactivating elements of the 113th FIW. In November 1952, the 121st, 142nd, and 148th FIS were returned to the control of the ANG and replaced by the 46th FIS at Dover, the 95th FIS at Andrews, and the 96th FIS at New Castle.|$|E
25|$|Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond {{was formed}} in April 1952 to replace the former Station Headquarters, along with a {{subordinate}} unit, Base Squadron Richmond, for the day-to-day running of the establishment. The base was evacuated in February 1956 due {{to the threat of}} rising floodwaters nearby, the only time in its history that flooding in the Hawkesbury region became serious enough to warrant such action. In 1958–59, No.36 Squadron began operating its first C-130 Hercules heavy transports, which were augmented by No.38 Squadron's DHC-4 Caribou tactical transports in 1964. No.86 Wing was disbanded in August that year, but reformed in February 1987, under the newly established Headquarters Air Lift Group that replaced the former Base Headquarters. At the same time, Base Squadron was reformed as <b>Base</b> <b>Support</b> Wing. No.86 Wing took control of No.33 Squadron, operating Boeing 707 jet tanker/transports, as well as Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons, flying Hercules. No.486 Maintenance Squadron and Air Movements Training and Development Unit (AMTDU) were also under its aegis at Richmond. The Hercules, Caribous and 707s became synonymous with disaster relief and emergency transport in Australia and the region, as well as deploying on overseas peacekeeping missions. Richmond was the venue for many air shows including, in 1988, the largest staged in Australia to that date, celebrating the Australian Bicentenary. The base also staged the RAAF's 70th Anniversary Air show in 1991, the same year that the Hercules achieved 500,000 accident-free hours of operation.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with its}} RAAF responsibilities, No.391 Squadron {{supported}} Australian Army and other UN personnel travelling through Iwakuni. It ran No.91 Wing's [...] "Transit Hotel", which accommodated business people and entertainers, {{as well as}} military personnel. The squadron maintained two detachments in South Korea, one at Kimpo Air Base to handle Meteor spares, and another at the RAAF ward of the British Commonwealth Zone Medical Unit in Seoul. <b>Base</b> <b>support</b> staff regularly rotated from Iwakuni to these detachments. No.391 Squadron's medical contingent was heavily engaged in the preparation and escort of injured personnel from Korea to Iwakuni and then to other destinations. The unit included a marine craft section equipped with small boats that patrolled harbours in southern Japan used by British and American flying boats, and conducted search-and-rescue operations for UN pilots who ditched at sea. No.391 Squadron used Japanese technicians as well as Australian, which was unusual at the time; since the occupation of Japan following its surrender in World WarII, Japanese workers had only been employed for menial tasks.|$|E
