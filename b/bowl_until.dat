5|$|The first postseason college {{football}} game was not played until 1902, with the Pasadena Tournament of Roses' {{establishment of the}} east–west tournament game, later known as the Rose Bowl. The Midshipmen {{did not participate in}} their first Rose <b>Bowl</b> <b>until</b> the 1923 season, when they went 5–1–2 and tied with the Washington Huskies 14–14 in the match. As a result of the lack of a competition, there were no postseason games played after the 1882 season.

5|$|O'Reilly won a {{scholarship}} to the Sydney Teachers College at Sydney University, to train as a schoolmaster.

Jumping 47feet, he came second in a triple jump competition behind Nick Winter, who went on to win gold in the event at the 1924 Summer Olympics with a world record of 50ft. O'Reilly also placed second in a high jumping competition, clearing six feet. Corish was also a cricket administrator and invited O'Reilly to play in a David Jones Second XI. Not knowing anything of his new recruit's abilities, Corish did not allow O'Reilly to <b>bowl</b> <b>until</b> he explicitly complained of only being allowed to field. O'Reilly promptly finished off the opposition's innings by removing the middle and lower order. After an encounter with journalist Johnny Moyes, who wrote glowingly about O'Reilly's skills.|$|E

25|$|Matcha Like gyokuro, matcha is shaded before plucking. The plucked and {{processed}} leaf is called tencha. This product is then ground into a fine powder, which is matcha.

It is prepared by whisking the tea with hot water in a <b>bowl,</b> <b>until</b> the surface is frothy. If the water is too hot, the tea may become overly bitter.|$|E

25|$|The Orange Bowl {{was also}} {{the site of the}} NCAA's longest college {{football}} home field winning streak. Between 1985 and 1994, the Miami Hurricanes won 58 straight home games at the <b>Bowl,</b> <b>until</b> ended by the Washington Huskies. The stadium's home field advantage used to include a steel structure that fans would set to rumbling by stomping their feet. Concrete reinforcement had silenced the rumble. There was still the advantage of the West End Zone, which had a relatively narrow radius that amplified fan noise. The West End Zone was a factor in the Wide Right curse, in which the Florida State Seminoles lost a series of close games due to missed field goals. This section was so raucous that some football announcers often confused it with the student section.|$|E
