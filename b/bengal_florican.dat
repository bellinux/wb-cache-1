25|$|Assam has {{wildlife}} sanctuaries, {{the most}} prominent of which are two UNESCO World Heritage sites-the Kaziranga National Park, {{on the bank of the}} Brahmaputra River, and the Manas Wildlife Sanctuary, near the border with Bhutan. The Kaziranga is a refuge for the fast-disappearing Indian one-horned rhinoceros. The state is the last refuge for numerous other endangered and threatened species including the white-winged wood duck or deohanh, <b>Bengal</b> <b>florican,</b> black-breasted parrotbill, red-headed vulture, white-rumped vulture, greater adjutant, Jerdon's babbler, rufous-necked hornbill, Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, pygmy hog, gaur, wild water buffalo, Indian hog deer, hoolock gibbon, golden langur, capped langur, barasingha, Ganges river dolphin, Barca snakehead, Ganges shark, Burmese python, brahminy river turtle, black pond turtle, Asian forest tortoise, and Assam roofed turtle. Threatened species that are extinct in Assam include the gharial, a critically endangered fish-eating crocodilian, and the pink-headed duck (which may be extinct worldwide). For the state bird, the white-winged wood duck, Assam is a globally important area. In addition to the above, there are three other National Parks in Assam namely Dibru Saikhowa National Park, Nameri National Park and the Orang National Park.|$|E

50|$|In spring 2011, 17 <b>Bengal</b> <b>floricans</b> were {{recorded}} from nine different sites along a 39 km north-south {{stretch of the}} Koshi River. Seven were males and 10 were females.

2500|$|The Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve is {{situated}} in the flood plains of the Saptkoshi River in the eastern Terai. It covers an area of [...] comprising grasslands and khair–sissoo riverine forests. It was established in 1976 and was declared a Ramsar site in 1987. The reserve provides habitat for hog deer, spotted deer, wild pig, blue bull, gaur, smooth-coated otter, jackal, 485 bird species including 114 water bird species, 200 fish species, 24 reptile and 11 amphibian species. The last surviving population of wild water buffalo in Nepal {{is found in the}} reserve, as well as gharial, Gangetic dolphin, swamp francolin and rufous-vented prinia. A small population of the critically endangered <b>Bengal</b> <b>florican</b> is present along the Kosi River. There are also records of white-throated bush chat and Finn's weaver.

50|$|<b>Bengal</b> <b>floricans</b> live in open tall {{grassland}} habitats with scattered bushes. The {{most important}} grass species are satintails (Imperata, in particular Cogongrass I. cylindrica), sugarcane (Saccharum, in particular S. munja and Kans Grass S. spontaneum), {{as well as}} Desmostachya bipinnata. The birds are usually encountered in the early mornings and evenings and are most easily spotted in the breeding season from March to August, which is when most censuses of the population are conducted. Particular between March and May, when they give their stunning courtship display, males are far more conspicuous than the cryptically-coloured females, which moreover prefer high grassland rich in sugarcane.|$|R
50|$|Adult <b>Bengal</b> <b>floricans</b> {{range from}} 66 - 68 cm {{in length and}} stand around 55 cm tall. The male has black plumage from {{the head and neck}} to underparts. Its head carries a long lanky crest, and the neck has {{elongated}} display plumes. The upperside is buff with fine black vermiculations and black arrowhead markings, and there is a conspicuous large white patch from the wing coverts to the remiges. In flight, the male's wings appear entirely white except for the dark primary remiges. The feet and legs are yellow, the bill and irides are dark.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 423 bird species has been recorded. The park {{supports}} the highest population of <b>Bengal</b> <b>floricans</b> in Nepal.

Forest birds include spot-bellied eagle owl, dusky eagle owl, rufous-bellied eagle and Oriental pied hornbill. The forests are also important for great slaty woodpecker and white-naped woodpecker. The white-rumped vulture, slender-billed vulture, lesser adjutant, grey-headed fish eagle, darter and rufous-rumped grassbird are breeding residents. Sarus crane, painted stork and bristled grassbird are summer visitors. Greater racquet-tailed drongo, white-capped water redstart, rusty-tailed flycatcher and rufous-gorgeted flycatcher are uncommon winter visitors.|$|R

5000|$|In Cambodia, it {{is mostly}} found in Kampong Thom Province; lesser numbers are found in Siem Reap Province and {{remnants}} might persist in Banteay Meanchey, Battambang and Pursat Provinces. Its rate of decline there has accelerated in the early 21st century, and the bird's numbers in Southeast Asia might fall to effective extinction in the early 2010s. The government of Cambodia has taken a significant step towards protecting important habitat for the <b>Bengal</b> <b>florican.</b> Along witih 350 square kilometers being designated as [...] "Integrated Farming and Biodiversity Areas", where land-use practices are adapted to also benefit the <b>Bengal</b> <b>florican,</b> a public education program to inform schoolchildren about the bird has also been undertaken. At present, the species may persist in the Ang Trapaing Thmor Crane Sanctuary and perhaps Vietnam's Tràm Chim National Park, but the South Asian population is not known with certainty from any protected areas.|$|E
50|$|The Manas hosts {{more than}} 450 species of birds. It {{has the largest}} {{population}} of the endangered <b>Bengal</b> <b>florican</b> to be found anywhere.

50|$|Jaldapara is {{a paradise}} for bird watchers. It {{is one of}} the very few places in India, where the <b>Bengal</b> <b>florican</b> is sighted. The other birds to be found here are the crested eagle, Pallas's fish eagle, shikra, Finn's weaver, jungle fowl, peafowl (peacock), partridge, and lesser pied hornbill. Pythons, monitor lizards, kraits, cobras, geckos, and about eight species of fresh water turtles can also be found here.|$|E
50|$|These {{bustards}} {{are found}} either singly or in pairs in thick grassland or sometimes in crop fields. Hunters regularly shot the males during the breeding season, {{as they were}} easy to spot because of their courtship display. It {{was said to be}} good for eating but considered inferior to the meat of the <b>Bengal</b> <b>florican.</b> They fly faster than other bustards and give a duck-like impression in flight.|$|E
50|$|The grasslands partly cover two BirdLife International Endemic Bird Areas, the Central Himalayas EBA {{in western}} Nepal {{and the western}} end of the Assam Plains EBA south of Bhutan. There are three near-endemic bird species {{including}} the vulnerable Manipur bush quail (Perdicula manipurensis). The 44 threatened and declining bird species of the grasslands include the <b>Bengal</b> <b>florican</b> (Houbaropsis bengalensis), lesser florican (Sypheotides indica), sarus crane (Grus antigone) and rufous-rumped grassbird (Graminicola bengalensis).|$|E
50|$|Rare {{game birds}} (which were once hunted) include {{partridges}} (swamp francolin), bustards (<b>Bengal</b> <b>florican)</b> and pigeons (pale-capped pigeon). Several other important families of birds inhabit Kaziranga, including rare species of hornbills (great Indian hornbill and the lesser risk wreathed hornbill), Old World babblers (Jerdon's babbler, marsh babbler) and weaver birds (the common baya weaver and the threatened Finn's weaver), thrushes (Hodgson's bushchat), Old World warblers (bristled grassbird). Other threatened species include the black-breasted parrotbill and rufous-vented prinia.|$|E
50|$|The only bird even {{remotely}} similar to adult males of the <b>Bengal</b> <b>florican</b> are their counterpart from the lesser florican (Sypheotides indica). This is a smaller, slimmer-necked bustard overall, and its males have cheek-tufts of plumes with pennant-like tips {{rather than the}} crest, and a white band between neck and back. The females are similar, and young Bengal floricans can be easily mistaken for female lesser floricans. The latter have almost white wing coverts however, resembling the males' wing patch.|$|E
