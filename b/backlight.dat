5|$|The design had stylistic {{traits of}} the MacBook Air which were also {{implemented}} {{into the design}} of the MacBook Pro. This model is thinner than the original polycarbonate MacBooks, and it made use of a unibody aluminum case with tapered edges. The keyboard of the higher-end model included a <b>backlight.</b>|$|E
5|$|When the {{computer}} was not in use, contents of the memory were preserved {{as long as the}} main lead-acid battery remained charged. The PowerBook100 Power Manager was an integrated circuit, usually placed on the logic board of a PowerBook, and was responsible for the power management of {{the computer}}. Identical to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the display's <b>backlight,</b> hard drive spin-down, sleep and wake, battery charging, trackball control, and input/output (I/O). The 100 did add a new feature: 3.5V batteries backed up permanent and expansion random access memory (RAM) when the PowerBook100's battery was being replaced or when the 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from all power sources. This made it a perfect candidate for use with Apple's RAM disk to help increase battery life by accessing the hard disk less frequently, since the 100 was the only PowerBook that maintained the contents of RAM on shutdown in order to reduce startup time.|$|E

25|$|Today, most LCD screens {{are being}} {{designed}} with an LED <b>backlight</b> {{instead of the}} traditional CCFL <b>backlight,</b> while that <b>backlight</b> is dynamically controlled with the video information (dynamic <b>backlight</b> control). The combination with the dynamic <b>backlight</b> control, invented by Philips researchers Douglas Stanton, Martinus Stroomer and Adrianus de Vaan, simultaneously increases the dynamic range of the display system (also marketed as HDR, high dynamic range television.|$|E

50|$|Colored LED <b>backlighting</b> is most {{commonly}} used in small, inexpensive LCD panels. White LED <b>backlighting</b> is becoming dominant. ELP <b>backlighting</b> is often used for larger displays or when even <b>backlighting</b> is important; {{it can also be}} either colored or white. An ELP must be driven by relatively high voltage AC power, which is provided by an inverter circuit. CCFL <b>backlights</b> are used on larger displays such as computer monitors, and are typically white in color; these also require the use of an inverter and diffuser. Incandescent <b>backlighting</b> were used by early LCD panels to achieve high brightness, but the limited life and excess heat produced by incandescent bulbs were severe limitations. The heat generated by incandescent bulbs typically requires the bulbs to be mounted away from the display to prevent damage.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Backlighting</b> helps {{separate}} {{the subject and}} the background. Live theatre lighting designs often use <b>backlighting</b> to give a more three-dimensional appearance to actors or set elements, when front lighting alone would give a flat, two-dimensional look. In chiaroscuro effects in painting, such as the candlelit paintings by Joseph Wright of Derby (illustration, left), <b>backlighting</b> helps separate subjects in the foreground and emphasizes depth.|$|R
50|$|The nominal {{operating}} voltage for LED <b>backlights</b> is 5V at full brightness, with dimming at lower voltages {{dependent on the}} details such as LED color. Non-LED <b>backlights</b> often require higher voltages.|$|R
25|$|Since LCD panels produce {{no light}} of their own, they require {{external}} light to produce a visible image. In a transmissive type of LCD, this light is provided {{at the back of}} the glass stack and is called the <b>backlight.</b> While passive-matrix displays are usually not backlit (e.g. calculators, wristwatches), active-matrix displays almost always are. Over the last years (1990 - 2017), the LCD <b>backlight</b> technologies have strongly been emerged by lighting companies such as Philips, Lumileds (a Philips subsidiary) and more.|$|E
25|$|Better power {{efficiency}} and thickness: LCDs filter the light emitted from a <b>backlight,</b> allowing {{a small fraction}} of light through. Thus, they cannot show true black. However, an inactive OLED element does not produce light or consume power, allowing true blacks. Removing the <b>backlight</b> also makes OLEDs lighter because some substrates are not needed. When looking at top-emitting OLEDs, thickness also plays a role when talking about index match layers (IMLs). Emission intensity is enhanced when the IML thickness is 1.3–2.5nbsp&nm. The refractive value and the matching of the optical IMLs property, including the device structure parameters, also enhance the emission intensity at these thicknesses.|$|E
25|$|Jepsen has {{described}} {{the removal of the}} filters that color the RGB subpixels as the critical design innovation in the new LCD. Instead of using subtractive color filters, the display uses a plastic diffraction grating and lenses on the rear of the LCD to illuminate each pixel. This grating pattern is stamped using the same technology used to make DVDs. The grating splits the light from the white <b>backlight</b> into a spectrum. The red, green and blue components are diffracted into the correct positions to illuminate the corresponding pixel with R, G or B. This innovation results in a much brighter display for a given amount of <b>backlight</b> illumination: while the color filters in a regular display typically absorb 85% of the light that hits them, this display absorbs little of that light. Most LCD screens at the time used cold cathode fluorescent lamp backlights which were fragile, difficult or impossible to repair, required a high voltage power supply, were relatively power-hungry, and accounted for 50% of the screens' cost (sometimes 60%). The LED <b>backlight</b> in the XO-1 is easily replaceable, rugged, and inexpensive.|$|E
50|$|The use of LED <b>backlights</b> in {{notebook}} computers has been growing. Sony has used LED <b>backlights</b> {{in some of}} its higher-end slim VAIO notebooks since 2005, and Fujitsu introduced notebooks with LED <b>backlights</b> in 2006. In 2007, Asus, Dell, and Apple introduced LED <b>backlights</b> into some of their notebook models. , Lenovo has also announced LED-backlit notebooks. In October 2008, Apple {{announced that it would}} be using LED <b>backlights</b> for all of its notebooks and new 24-inch Apple Cinema Display, and one year later it introduced a new LED iMac, meaning all of Apple's new computer screens are now LED. Almost every laptop with a 16:9 display introduced since September 2009 uses LED-backlit panels. This is also the case for most LCD television sets, which are marketed in some countries under the misleading name LED TV, although the image is still generated by an LCD panel.|$|R

Preferably the lightguide further has a second surface which has a plurality of lenticular lenses for reimaging the reflected light from the linear regions into a series of thin vertical lines outside the guide. Because of the reduced thickness of the <b>backlighter</b> system, autostereoscopic viewing is enabled in applications requiring thin <b>backlighter</b> systems. In addition to taking up less space, the reduced-thickness <b>backlighter</b> uses less lamps and less power.

25|$|The {{traditional}} three-point lighting set-up routinely used in filmmaking {{and television}} production {{is also used}} on daytime soap operas, sometimes with accentuated back lighting to lift actors out of the background.

25|$|Due to the LCD layer {{that generates}} the desired high {{resolution}} images at flashing video speeds using very low power electronics {{in combination with}} these excellent LED based <b>backlight</b> technologies, LCD technology has become the domination display technology for products such as televisions, desktop monitors, notebooks, tablets, smartphones and mobile phones. Although competing OLED technology is pushed to the market, such OLED displays does not feature the HDR capabilities like LCDs in combination with 2D LED <b>backlight</b> technologies have, reason why the annual market of such LCD-based products is still growing faster (in volume) than OLED-based products while the efficiency of LCDs (and products like portable computers, mobile phones and televisions) may even be further improved by preventing the light to be absorbed in the colour filters of the LCD. Although until today such reflective colour filter solutions are not yet implemented by the LCD industry and did not made it further than laboratory prototypes, such reflective colour filter solutions still likely will be implemented by the LCD industry to increase the performance gap with OLED technologies).|$|E

25|$|The LCD <b>backlight</b> {{systems are}} made highly {{efficient}} by applying optical {{films such as}} prismatic structure to gain the light into the desired viewer directions and reflective polarizing films that recycle the polarized light that was formerly absorbed by the first polarizer of the LCD (invented by Philips researchers Adrianus de Vaan and Paulus Schaareman), generally achieved using so called DBEF films manufactured and supplied by 3M. These polarizers consist of a large stack of uniaxial oriented birefringent films that reflect the former absorbed polarization mode of the light. Such reflective polarizers using uniaxial oriented polymerized liquid crystals (birefringent polymers or birefringent glue) are invented in 1989 by Philips researchers Dirk Broer, Adrianus de Vaan and Joerg Brambring. The combination of such reflective polarizers, and LED dynamic <b>backlight</b> control make today's LCD televisions far more efficient than the CRT-based sets, leading to a worldwide energy saving of 600 TWh (2017), equal to 10% of the electricity consumption of all households worldwide or equal to 2 times the energy production of all solar cells in the world.|$|E
