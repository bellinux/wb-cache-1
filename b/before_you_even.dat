500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave [...] "Live While We're Young" [...] {{four out}} of five stars and wrote, [...] "it's little {{different}} from what we've heard before [...] but when you're the world's biggest boyband, it's no bad thing." [...] Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times summarised it as a [...] "characteristically peppy piece of high-gloss party pop." [...] Lansky praised its effectiveness and thought it was [...] "perfectly tailored to top the charts." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Popdust acknowledged that [...] "the song is smart to swipe the guitar-only opening pattern from The Clash's [...] "Should I Stay or Should I Go?"—akin to [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] lifting the [...] "Summer Nights" [...] beginning—calling on pop history to get you excited for the song <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> really realise why." [...] Unterberger further highlighted the small lyrical plays for conveying [...] "an incredible amount of urgency and fun without much clunky verbage , making singing along something of an inevitability." [...] A writer for The Huffington Post asserted that the song delivers for fans of their debut album: [...] "a poppy, energetic, happy-go-lucky track." ...|$|E
500|$|Idolator reviewers {{were divided}} in their {{opinion of the}} song. Christina Lee deemed it [...] "a {{surprisingly}} thrilling, high-stakes moment" [...] on the album, while Carl Williot felt Ora's hook overshadowed Azalea's verses on the song. Exclaim! journalist Erin Lowers wrote, [...] "'Black Widow' should pass the threshold between mediocrity and superstardom, but falls by the wayside with little personality." [...] Drowned in Sound's Giuseppe Zevolli negatively reviewed the song, writing, [...] "'Black Widow' is so preoccupied with its overfilled, catchall crescendo that it oozes away <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> notice". Kellan Miller of XXL felt that the song intended to be [...] "a hit-to-oliberate-all-other-hits-forever-and-ever-amen", but ultimately was [...] "a fourth quarter Hail Mary pass at best." [...] In his review, Miller added, [...] "Instead of remaining steadfast to the shimmer that made the early offerings bright spots, Iggy veers off course in an all too contrived effort to meet the quota of her colossal ambition." [...] Gigwise's Alexandra Pollard criticized the track's similarities with [...] "Dark Horse" [...] and dismissed Perry for repeating her [...] "tried-and-tested-formula". StarGate's involvement was panned by Alfred Soto of Spin, who said the song's hook was borrowed from the duo's previous production for Barbadian recording artist Rihanna's [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] (2007). Additionally, Soto dismissed the track's synth line as being [...] "nicked" [...] from StarGate's production on American singer-songwriter Ne-Yo's Libra Scale (2010). The song was named the eighth worst song of 2014 by Time magazine.|$|E
2500|$|One Friday {{evening in}} March, 1980, Bonin offered a 17-year-old named William Ray Pugh {{a ride home}} as the pair left the house of Everett Fraser. Within minutes of {{accepting}} the ride, Bonin asked Pugh whether {{he would like to}} engage in sex with him. Pugh later stated he panicked and stuttered upon hearing this question and, after sitting in silence for several minutes, attempted to leave the vehicle once Bonin had slowed the van at a stoplight. In response, Bonin wordlessly leaned across and grabbed Pugh by the collar, dragging him back into the passenger seat. According to Pugh, Bonin then confided in him that he enjoyed abducting young male hitchhikers on Friday and Saturday nights, whom he then restrained and abused before strangling them to death with their own T-shirts. In a matter-of-fact tone, Bonin then informed Pugh: [...] "If you want to kill somebody, you should make a plan and find a place to dump the body <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> pick a victim." [...] Bonin then informed Pugh he had not chosen to refrain from assaulting and killing him out of sentiment; he'd been spared because the pair had been seen leaving Fraser's party together.|$|E

6000|$|Maggie Bradford looked such a {{sweet little}} sinner as she boldly made this sad confession, {{that no one}} could scold her, though Ida Standish, her bosom friend, shook her head, and Anna said, with a sigh: [...] "I'm afraid we all feel very much as Maggie does, though we don't own it so honestly. Last spring, when I was ill and thought I might die, I was so ashamed of my idle, {{frivolous}} winter, that I felt as if I'd give all I {{had to be able to}} live it over and do better. Much is not expected of a girl of eighteen, I know; but oh! there were heaps of kind little things I might have done if I hadn't thought only of myself. I resolved if I lived I'd try at least to be less selfish, and make some one happier for my being in the world. I tell you, girls, it's rather solemn when you lie expecting to die, and your sins come up <b>before</b> <b>you,</b> <b>even</b> though they are very small ones. I never shall forget it, and after my lovely summer I mean to be a better girl, and lead a better life if I can." ...|$|E

Tyler's plots are the mere stuff of family albums, really—a procession of marriages, births, deaths. And yet her feel for character is so keen that even…readers who….would happily fry the whole notion of “character” for breakfast—are reduced to the role of helpless gossips, swapping avid hunches about the possible fates of the characters.

6000|$|To this {{question}} he got no definite answer, {{and as he}} went away immediately afterwards he hardly seemed to expect one. He did not even ask for Mrs. Askerton, and as that lady remarked, behaved altogether like a bear. [...] "But what a munificent bear!" [...] she said. [...] "Fancy;--eight hundred a year of your own.

5000|$|The Boost earned {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half of a {{possible}} four stars in a Dec. 28, 1988 Chicago Sun-Times review, calling the film [...] "one of the most convincing and horrifying portraits of drug addiction I've ever seen." [...] Leonard Maltin was not so kind, however, giving the movie only one-and-a-half {{of a possible}} four stars: [...] "A misfire that's on the screen for 30 minutes <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> realize that it *is* anti-drug...As with Jack Nicholson in The Shining, it's hard to distinguish the 'before' Lenny from the 'after'." ...|$|E

Kate has added her charms {{to a new level}} of 'Christmas album', featuring classics with a twist, that only Kate could deliver".Beauty and Lace said, [...] "Kate Ceberano’s Merry Christmas contains classics that everyone is familiar with, twisted to suit Kate’s style. It has a very upbeat and jazzy feel to it that will get your toes tapping and have you singing along <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> realise".|$|E
5000|$|Haunted {{received}} mixed to favorable {{reviews from}} critics upon its release. Haunted received a negative review from The New York Times columnist Tom Shone who noted that despite being {{referred to as}} a horror novel it is [...] "...stubbornly unscary. It burps up its shock moments with so little ceremony that the Gothic virtue of stealthily sidewinding suspense -- the art of allowing a story to steal up on you <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> knew it was there -- is left whistling in the wind." [...] Shone additionally noted the repetitive nature of many of the stories within the novel noting that every single story regardless of which character was narrating all utilized Palahniuk's distinctive style.|$|E

I think almost 80 percent of this record can be duplicated by a band, which is important for music, because that means 10 years from now, somebody can make a whole song {{out of it and}} cover it like how I'm covering The Beatles song.|$|R

5000|$|In {{a section}} called [...] "Rhetorical Structure and Strategy", {{in the chapter}} [...] "Syntax and Rhetorical Structure: Words in Order and Disorder", Annie Finch writes, [...] "Every time you write a poem, and {{probably}} <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> begin, you make a myriad of even more fundamental choices about its rhetorical stance and structure. Many of these choices are unconscious, based on ideas of 'what a poem is' that you have absorbed long before. To make these choices conscious, {{at least once in}} a while, can be refreshing and even eye-opening." [...] Finch then offers a list of questions to ask regarding a poem's rhetorical structure and strategy, the last of which asks, [...] "And finally, what are the rhetorical turns taken in the poem? How does the poem shape itself so that, when one has finished reading, one feels the poem is over, that something has happened, that something has changed?" ...|$|E
50|$|Comm South Companies {{was created}} and opened for {{business}} in the late 1990s. They offered prepaid home phone service to anyone regardless of credit, past due bills, or proof of identity. When the company started all dial tone lines were completely blocked meaning that only local telephone calls could be made and no collect, 900, or other toll calls could be made. If you wanted to call long distance you {{would be required to}} buy a prepaid long distance card from a local store. Over time, Comm South Companies acquired a long distance plan which would allow you to make long distance calls from your home phone which was prepaid in advance. Each bill you received from Comm South was a bill for the next month of service and the due date was before that next month of service which is why the service was prepaid <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> used it to prevent people from running up high bills and not paying.|$|E

[...] In that same interview, Tyson said that race is not a part of the point he is trying to make in his career or with his life. According to Tyson, [...] "That then becomes the point of people’s understanding of me, rather than the astrophysics. So it’s a failed educational step for that to be the case. If you end up being distracted by that and not getting the message." [...] He purposefully no longer speaks publicly about race. [...] "I don't give talks on it. I don’t even give Black History Month talks. I decline every single one of them. In fact, since 1993, I've declined every interview that has my being black as a premise of the interview." ...|$|E

There are probably a hundred men sleeping in the battery, {{and it is likely}} they would have sentries out in front of it. The loss of four men would seriously weaken the garrison." ...|$|R
40|$|Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, {{the subject}} that I wish to bring <b>before</b> <b>you</b> this <b>evening</b> is one of great {{interest}} to the public in general, and especially to a Society like this. From the statistics supplied from your department, Mr. President, it appears that for the last quarter the deaths have exceeded the births by a considerable amount. If this continues it will be disastrous to the country. Now, {{we may not be able}} to increase the birth-rate, as that depends on economic and other causes which we cannot by any action on our part effect. But we can and ought to take all possible measures to ensure that every child born into this world has a proper chance of growing up and growing into an efficient citizen...|$|R
60|$|Another {{difficulty}} about statistics is {{the technical}} difficulty of calculation. <b>Before</b> <b>you</b> can <b>even</b> {{make a mistake}} in drawing your conclusion from the correlations established by your statistics you must ascertain the correlations. When I turn over the pages of Biometrika, a quarterly journal in which is recorded the work done {{in the field of}} biological statistics by Professor Karl Pearson and his colleagues, I am out of my depth at the first line, because mathematics are to me only a concept: I never used a logarithm in my life, and could not undertake to extract the square root of four without misgiving. I am therefore unable to deny that the statistical ascertainment of the correlations between one thing and another must be a very complicated and difficult technical business, not to be tackled successfully except by high mathematicians; and I cannot resist Professor Karl Pearson's immense contempt for, and indignant sense of grave social danger in, the unskilled guesses of the ordinary sociologist.|$|R
