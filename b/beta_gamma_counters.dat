Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. 21 -hydroxylase deficiency is the commonest enzyme defect in congenital adrenal hyperplasia resulting in low circulating cortisol and, in severe cases, low aldosterone which may lead to cardiac arrest in the neonate. As the low levels of coitisolÂ· lead to raised levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone large concentrations of androgens are formed in utero which may lead to cliteromegaly and consequent confusion of the sexes at birth. High concentrations of the androgens give rise to rapid growth in early childhood and early fusion of the epiphyses results in short stature of the adult. 17 -alphahydroxyprogesterone (170 HP) is raised in the blood and saliva of children with 21 -hydroxylase deficiency. 170 HP is commonly measured by radioimmunoassay which limits the assay to being performed by laboratories equipped with <b>beta</b> or <b>gamma</b> <b>counters.</b> The aim of this project was to develop an enzymeimmunoassay which could be carried out using the minimum amount of equipment. Horseradish peroxidase was conjugated to 170 HP-O-carboxymethyloxime using a mixed anhydride reaction. Separation of free and bound label was achieved using a second antibody linked to magnetisable particle solid phase. Measurement of the bound enzyme activity yielded colours which could be compared by eye, with known standards, to give a semi-quantitative assay. Alternatively the absorbance could be measured using a spectrophotometer for full quantitative results. The developed assays were evaluated, comparing the results with radioimmunoassay, and then used for measuring 170 HP in blood and saliva in various clinical situations...|$|R

40|$|The {{interactions}} between guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins and the Ca(2 +) -binding protein calmodulin were studied using calmodulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Purified bovine brain <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> subunits bound to calmodulin-Sepharose in a Ca(2 +) -dependent manner. On the contrary, <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> subunits produced in an activated Go/Gi preparation did not bind to calmodulin-Sepharose. The effect was {{independent of the}} type of bovine brain G protein (Go/Gi, Gs), method of activation and the presence of magnesium. To distinguish whether the binding of purified <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> subunits to calmodulin was unique to brain <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> or to the method of purification, similar experiments were performed using transducin. In contrast to bovine brain G proteins, both purified transducin <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> subunits and <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> released from rhodopsin-activated transducin bound to calmodulin-Sepharose in a Ca(2 +) -dependent manner. To assess the functional significance of the binding of bovine brain <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> subunits to calmodulin, the ability of purified <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> and of <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> in unactivated and activated Go/Gi to inhibit partially purified calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase was determined. Purified <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> was highly effective in inhibiting calmodulin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. However, unactivated Go/Gi and preactivated Go/Gi inhibited calmodulin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity to the same extent. This Go/Gi-mediated inhibition also occurred {{in the presence of a}} 500 -fold molar excess of calmodulin over added G protein. These results demonstrate: (1) that <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> subunits may not be completely released upon G protein activation, and (2) that inhibition of calmodulin-stimulated adenylate cyclase by <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> subunits does not appear to be mediated by a direct beta gamma-calmodulin interaction. Differences in the binding properties of activated bovine brain G proteins versus those of transducin could be explained by differences in the gamma subunit between the proteins, or by differences in affinities of the alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> subunits for each other and for calmodulin. The different functional properties of purified <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> subunits and <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> subunits produced in situ by activation of G proteins indicates that extrapolation from the effects of purified subunits to events occurring in membranes should be done with caution...|$|R

Purified alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> subunits of the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein have each {{been reported to}} open the K+ channel. We have reported that nanomolar concentrations of purified brain <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> subunits activated IK. ACh in chicken embryonic atrial patches. In contrast, J. Codina, A. Yatani, D.

In this paper, we further explore the specificity of various <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> and alpha subunits in embryonic chicken and neonatal rat atrial patches. <b>Beta</b> <b>gamma</b> subunits from either human placenta (<b>beta</b> 35 <b>gamma)</b> or bovine brain (<b>beta</b> 35, 36 <b>gamma)</b> activated IK.

Negative results were not due to patch vesicle formation. Other experiments indicated that alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> activated the same population of channels.

Either in {{the presence or absence}} of Mg 2 +, G <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> activated the KACh channel in a concentration-dependent fashion. 10 nM G <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> almost fully activated the channel in 132 of 134 patches (98. 5 %). The G beta gamma-induced maximal channel activity was equivalent to or sometimes larger than the GTP-gamma S-induced one. Half-maximal activation occurred at approximately 6 nM G <b>beta</b> <b>gamma.</b> Detergent (CHAPS) and boiled G <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> preparation could not activate the KACh channel. G <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> suspended by Lubrol PX instead of CHAPS also activated the channel. Even when G <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> was pretreated in Mg(2 +) -free EDTA internal solution containing GDP analogues (24 - 48 h) to inactivate possibly contaminating G i alpha *'s, the G <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> activated the channel. Furthermore, G <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> preincubated with excessive GDP-bound G o alpha did not activate the channel. These results indicate that G <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> itself, but neither the detergent CHAPS nor contaminating G i alpha *, activates the KACh channel. Three different kinds of G i alpha * at 10 pM- 10 nM could weakly activate the KACh channel. However, they were effective only in 40 of 124 patches (32. 2 %) and their maximal channel activation was approximately 20 % of that induced by GTP-gamma S or G <b>beta</b> <b>gamma.</b> Thus, G i alpha * activation of the KACh channel may not be significant. On the other hand, G i alpha *'s effectively activated the ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP) in the ventricular cell membrane when the KATP channel was maintained phosphorylated by the internal solution containing 100 microM Mg. ATP. G <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> inhibited adenosine or mACh receptor-mediated, intracellular GTP-induced activation of the KATP channel. G i alpha *'s also activated the phosphorylated KATP channel in the atrial cell membrane, but did not affect the background KACh channel.

40|$|The <b>beta</b> and <b>gamma</b> {{subunits}} of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) {{have recently}} been shown to {{play an active role}} in signal transduction. Among other effects they enable translocation of the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and thus permit phosphorylation and ultimately desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors and other G-protein-coupled receptors. To investigate the specificity of this effect, we have purified various combinations of recombinant <b>beta</b> and <b>gamma</b> subunits expressed in Sf 9 cells and measured their effects on beta ARK-catalyzed phosphorylation of beta 2 -adrenergic receptors and of rhodopsin.

We have identified a new gene, designated STE 20, which encodes a protein kinase homologue with sequence similarity to protein kinase C, which is required to transmit the pheromone signal from G <b>beta</b> <b>gamma</b> to downstream components of the signalling pathway. Overproduction of the kinase suppresses the mating defect of dominant-negative G beta mutations providing genetic evidence for an interaction with G beta, and epistasis experiments show that this kinase functions after or at the same point as G <b>beta</b> <b>gamma,</b> but before any of the other currently identified components of the signalling pathway. This points to a potentially new mechanism of G-protein mediated signal transduction, the activation of a protein kinase through G <b>beta</b> <b>gamma...</b>|$|R
