40|$|A {{real-time}} dynamic {{feedback control}} system is developed. An improved PID algorithm, called the integral separated piecewise PID scheme, {{is used in the}} control system. This algorithm is able to limit the contribution of the integral component in the PID calculation to avoid integral windup. In addition, it could use different PID parameters to adapt to different segments within one punch motion cycle. Hence, the error of the punch motion, either resulting from the machine assembly or from the machine dynamics, can be compensated by tuning the velocity of the servomotor. This is a unique feature of the new press that ensures its accuracy. Based on the novel structure, the detailed design is then carried out, which includes the mechanical design, kinematics and inverse kinematics analysis, static force analysis, parametric design and the other related designs. A calibration method based on the experiment and computer simulation is proposed for the new press, which is also useful for the parallel mechanisms. Cooperated with Guangdong Metal Forming Machine Works Co. Ltd., a 250 KN prototype has been built and tested. In order to ensure the desirable performance, dynamic control is necessary. The thesis uses two dynamic modeling methods to study the dynamics of the press. One is the kineto-static method. It is also called D'Alembert principle which rearranges Newton's second law and transfers a dynamic problem to an equivalent static problem by adding the inertial forces and inertial torques onto the system. The model can then be analyzed easily and exactly as a static system subjected to the inertial forces and torques and the external forces. The other method is the Lagrangian method which derives the dynamic model from the energy perspective. Based on the model, the dynamics of the press is studied by means of computer simulation and is validated experimentally. In this thesis, a controllable hybrid mechanical metal forming press is developed, which is driven by a CSM with a flywheel and a servomotor. From a mechanism point of view, it is a closed-loop 2 -DOF parallel planar five-bar mechanism with four resolute joints and one prismatic joint. Thanks to the usage of the servomotor, the punch motion of the new press can be controlled by tuning the velocity of the servomotor. Accordingly, desired punch motions for different stamping processes can be obtained. In other words, the new press is flexible and controllable like the servo mechanical press and the hydraulic press. Moreover, the CSM with flywheel provides the main power during the stamping operation, and hence, it is energy efficient. In addition, it is not expensive to build, as it uses only a small servomotor. Metal forming {{is one of the oldest}} production processes and yet, is still one of the most commonly used processes today. Everyday, millions of parts are produced by metal forming ranging from <b>battery</b> <b>caps</b> to automobile body panels. Therefore, even a small improvement may add to significant corporative gain. The thesis also describes the trajectory planning method for the press, which is based on the combination of the inverse kinematics and cubic spline interpolation. The trajectory is optimized under multiple constraints on velocity, acceleration and jerk of the servomotor. It guarantees the new press is controllable and energy efficient. Two typical stamping processes, drawing and forging, are taken as examples for the operations of the new press. The results of the simulation and the experiment match well. Based on the simulation and experiments, it is found that the CSM provides the main power for the metal forming operations, while the servomotor is mainly responsible for overcoming the inertia forces to realize the desired punch motion. The experiments show that the new press is energy efficient, fast, controllable and inexpensive to build. It combines the advantages of both mechanical press and hydraulic press and has a good performance. It is expected the new press will have a great potential for the metal forming industry.

40|$|Light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs) {{are emerging}} as viable replacements for incandescent-based cap lamps used in mining. The photometric and energy characteristics of these light sources differ in important ways. The present paper describes {{the performance of}} LED and incandescent sources in cap lamps in terms of correlated color temperature, color rendering, light output, electric power, ambient temperature and airflow, and light source aging. Importantly, these characteristics can influence a miner s ability to spot mining hazards thus impacting safety. Secondly, some of these characteristics interact with the operating life of the <b>cap</b> lamp s <b>battery</b> power, such that differences between LED and incandescent sources can be magnified {{toward the end of}} a 10 hour battery discharge cycle. Empirically, we have determined that after 8 hours at an ambient temperature of 25 C, the average light output of an incandescent cap lamp can decrease to about 69 % of its initial value when powered by a lead-acid battery and it can decrease to about 65 % of its initial value when powered by a nickel-hydride <b>battery.</b> An LED-based <b>cap</b> lamp using a constant current drive circuit can maintain about 96 % of its initial value when powered by a nickel-hydride battery. Real-world tests addressing the effects of ambient temperature and airflow on the light output of an LED and incandescent cap lamp were conducted in the NIOSH Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM). The LED cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance improvement of approximately 9. 5 % and the INC cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance degradation o f approximately 4 %. The differences between LED and incandescent cap lamps were further quantified by the calculation of mesopic luminance data that indicated for the same photopic luminance (i. e., as measured using a conventional light meter) the LED cap lamp could be up to 38 % more efficient than the incandescent cap lamp with a lead-acid battery {{at the end of the}} 10 -hour driving cycle. Lastly, accelerated life tests were used to empirically determine light output depreciation as the incandescent light source age approached its useful life. There was about a 35 % decrease in light output. This is quite considerable, especially given that the light output will decrease an additional 30 % to 45 % over the period of a 10 -hour shift. The implications of the differences between LED and incandescent sources are discussed. This information is crucial in determining how visual performance could be affected for real-world conditions where batteries discharge during the work shift and as the light source ages. To date, only idealized conditions have been used for LED and incandescent cap lamp visual performance research...|$|R
