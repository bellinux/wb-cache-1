Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll <b>be</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And without looking back, {{he got out of the}} car and went through that door.|$|E

However," [...] he added, as an afterthought, glancing at the disfigured Hassan, [...] "we have their captain, and of course you mean to hang him, Baas. Or if you don't like to, leave it to me. I can hang men very well. Once, when I was young, I helped the executioner at Cape Town." ...|$|E

We believe that evidence, but if by one jot or one tittle it is false, then not justice, but a foul murder will have been committed and his innocent blood will be upon your heads for ever. Hernando Pereira and Henri Marais, the court appoints {{you to be the}} guards who will bring the prisoner out of his house to-morrow morning just when the sky begins to lighten. It is from you that he will try to escape, and you will prevent his escape by his death. Then you must join us where we shall <b>be</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> and report the execution." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This," [...] he added, {{pointing}} to a paper which I had taken from him, [...] "is a plan of the village and of the Pass of Cergues close by. Study it carefully. At some point some way up the pass, which I have marked with a cross, I and my men with the 'babies' will <b>be</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to-morrow evening at eight o'clock. You cannot possibly fail to find the spot, for the plan is very accurate and very minute, and it is less than five hundred metres from the last house {{at the entrance of}} the pass. I shall escort the men until then, and hand them over into your charge for the mountain journey. Is that clear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I've got an idea," [...] Daylight said, hastening {{to get the}} {{conversation}} on less perilous ground. [...] "We're running away from cities, {{and you have no}} kith nor kin, so it don't seem exactly right that we should start off by getting married in a city. So here's the idea: I'll run up to the ranch and get things in shape around the house and give the caretaker his walking-papers. You follow me in a couple of days, coming on the morning train. I'll have the preacher fixed and waiting. And here's another idea. You bring your riding togs in a suit case. And as soon as the ceremony's over, {{you can go to the}} hotel and change. Then out you come, and you find me waiting with a couple of horses, and we'll ride over the landscape so as you can see the prettiest parts of the ranch the first thing. And she's sure pretty, that ranch. And now that it's settled, I'll <b>be</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> at the morning train day after to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Don't misinterpret me! I am not {{returning}} to England to retract what I said to Nugent. I still leave him free to plead his own cause with Lucilla {{in his own}} person. I am still resolved not to distress myself and distress them, by {{returning to}} Dimchurch. But I have a longing that nothing can subdue, {{to know how it}} has ended between them. Don't ask me to say more than that! In spite of the time that has passed, it breaks my heart to talk of Lucilla. I had looked forward to a meeting with you in London, and to hearing what I longed to hear, from your lips. Judge for yourself what my hopes were when I first saw your face; and forgive me if I felt my disappointment bitterly, when I found that you had really no news to tell, and when you spoke of Nugent as you did." [...] He stopped, and pressed my arm earnestly. [...] "Suppose I am right about Miss Finch's letter?" [...] he added. [...] "Suppose it should really <b>be</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> at the post?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, we <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to begin,' said Mrs. Beecher reproachfully. 'Do {{let us have}} something, {{for really}} the time is {{slipping}} away.' ...|$|R

"Malcolm, I {{think you}} cannot {{do better than}} take your place {{in the garden of}} the house next to his; it is a place that has stood empty for many months, and there is no chance of anyone seeing you. His paddock comes up to the garden, and you can, by placing {{yourself}} in the corner, see him as he comes out into the lane. As soon as you see that he has gone, come back to the Greyhound with the news. I shall be there, and you will pick up Chester in the High Street as you come along; of course you won't pretend to know me, but the mere fact of your coming back will be enough to tell me that he has gone. As soon as it gets dark we will pay our reckoning, and drive off in the gig, leaving it in the drive {{in front of the house}} this side of his. I shall have strolled off before, and shall <b>be</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> there. If he does not come out by ten o'clock we can give it up for tonight. You had better say that you have changed your mind, and will take beds at the Greyhound; and the next morning drive off in your gig and put up again at the inn at the other end of the town, the White Horse. I will come over again at two o'clock in the afternoon. You will bring handcuffs, and you had better also bring a stout rope to tie him with." ...|$|E
