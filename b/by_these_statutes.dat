5000|$|In {{the same}} {{direction}} as Katyal argues Kevin Russell, who teaches Supreme Court litigation at Harvard and Stanford Law Schools and clerked for Judge William Norris of the Ninth Circuit and Justice Stephen Breyer. According to him several significant civil rights statutes, enacted under Congress's Spending Power, are at risk to be unconstitutional, because the Court held that Congress exceeded its Spending Clause authority by forcing states into an all-or-nothing choice by threatening to revoke all of their Medicaid funding if they did not participate in the Medicaid expansion. Russell remembers that a decade ago several states made challenges to a number of important civil rights statutes that condition receipt of federal funds on the state's agreement to abide by non-discrimination principles in the federally funded programs. [...] "These statutes include Title IX (sex discrimination in federally funded education programs), Title IV (race discrimination in any federally funded program), and the Rehabilitation Act (disability discrimination in federally funded programs). States argued that by threatening to take away all of a program's funds if the State's didn't agree to abide <b>by</b> <b>these</b> <b>statutes,</b> Congress was engaging in unconstitutional coercion." ...|$|E

40|$|More {{than three}} decades {{after the birth of}} the first child {{conceived}} through in vitro fertilization, few states have comprehensive statutes to establish the parentage of children born using assisted reproduction techniques (ART). While thousands of such children are born each year courts struggle to apply outdated laws. For example, does a statute terminating paternity for a man who donates sperm to a married woman apply if the woman is unmarried? In 2008, the Uniform Probate Code (UPC) added two much-needed sections on the complicated parentage and inheritance issues that arise in the field of assisted reproduction. Yet it is unclear whether states will enact these new UPC sections; few states have enacted comparable provisions of the Uniform Parentage Act (UPA). The issues can be controversial, particularly regarding children born years after an intended parent 2 ̆ 7 s death, or when the discussion turns to enforcement of a contract for a gestational carrier, the preferred term for a surrogate mother. This Article explores the legal landscape for children conceived through assisted insemination, in vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and other techniques. The Article discusses the differences between the UPA and UPC sections that concern assisted reproduction. It examines the critical normative and ethical questions answered <b>by</b> <b>these</b> <b>statutes</b> and analyzes the likelihood that states will adopt either uniform act. The Article looks briefly at gestational carrier agreements to consider whether and how they should be enforced. The Article concludes by noting the need for legislation, the virtues of the UPC over the UPA, and the hope that states will address all those who use ART including gay and lesbian couples, and single parents...|$|E

40|$|Access {{and privacy}} {{legislation}} (also known as information rights legislation) {{has been an}} evolving feature of Canadian life {{for more than twenty}} years. Public archives, as custodians of the records of their government sponsors, are profoundly influenced <b>by</b> <b>these</b> <b>statutes.</b> There are two factors that combine to make Manitoba unique in the Canadian access and privacy landscape. The Provincial Archives of Manitoba does not assume the role of “gatekeeper” of access to records in archival custody. Instead, it serves as “guide” to them and to all other records covered by the legislation, in its role as the central administrative office for the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. This approach has resulted in both benefits and challenges for the Provincial Archives. By the same token, the more common role of a provincial archival institution – actually determining access to records in its custody and control – has, according to the literature, been challenging and problematic. This thesis is a case study of the “Manitoba model”. It explores the history of public recordkeeping {{and the creation of a}} reliable government records program at the Provincial Archives of Manitoba, which provided the foundation of access to information. It also discusses how information rights legislation developed in Manitoba, the role of the Provincial Archives in this development, and the impact on it of the responsibilities which have resulted from this role. The thesis examines some of the issues arising out of Canadian access and privacy legislation which have particular implications for archival institutions and concludes with suggestions for changes which address the question of the role of a public archives in relation to information rights legislation...|$|E

40|$|The Article explores {{an issue}} with which many law schools, law students, and courts struggle. It begins with an {{overview}} of the relevant federal disability discrimination statutes, with particular attention to recent United States Supreme Court decisions that strictly interpret the “disabilities” protected <b>by</b> <b>these</b> <b>statutes,</b> and to recent cases in which lower courts have accordingly held that a student’s impairment is not a statutorily protected disability. As it turns out, many dismissed law students submitting documentation of a disability are not legally disabled in the first instance. The statutory overview also compares the markedly different approach of the federal preK- 12 special education statute (the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”)), under which many such students were served earlier in their educational careers, and which creates expectations {{on the part of the}} students about their eligibility and protection under higher education disability law. The Article also reviews and examines the Supreme Court’s tradition of deference to higher education academic decisions, recently reiterated in the University of Michigan affirmative action cases, in which higher education admissions decisions were challenged as racially discriminatory. The Article then reviews the body of law (both actual lower court cases and OCR administrative opinions) in which academically dismissed higher education students denied readmission have made disability discrimination claims. In the overwhelming majority of these cases and opinions, including all of the court cases involving law schools, schools have prevailed without going to trial, normally by receiving summary judgment. Moreover, courts in these cases have regularly announced a policy of deferring to the school’s academic decisions concerning academic dismissal and readmission. Examination of the few court cases in which (non law) schools were not granted summary judgment offers helpful guidance to law schools faced with such claims. The Article finds that the courts’ approach in these cases is appropriate, although no doubt frustrating to students whose planned careers may well have ended. The Article concludes by offering guidelines for law schools trying to do the right thing (i. e. make a decision which is both principled and nondiscriminatory) when faced with readmissions petitions by Student or other dismissed students claiming a disability...|$|E
