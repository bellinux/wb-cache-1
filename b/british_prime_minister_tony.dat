5|$|Sarah Conlon (née Maguire) (20 January 1926 – 19 July 2008) was an Irish {{housewife}} and {{a prominent}} campaigner {{in one of}} the most high-profile miscarriage of justice cases in British legal history. She spent decades campaigning to have the names of her husband Giuseppe and son Gerry cleared over the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) pub bombings at Guildford and Woolwich, and helped secure an apology from former <b>British</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>Tony</b> Blair in 2005 for their wrongful imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, a {{state funeral}} was {{conducted}} in the Washington National Cathedral, and presided over by President George W. Bush.

Final approval was gained from Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Kabbah, and <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Tony</b> Blair, while the Army Legal Corps secured approval from the Sierra Leonean Police. Fordham, who had been leading the negotiations, telephoned the West Side Boys {{and was able to}} establish that the captive soldiers were alive, and the final orders were issued in the evening of 9 September.|$|E

5|$|Before {{and during}} the summit US {{president}} George W. Bush, <b>British</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>Tony</b> Blair, Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper and Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende made a plea to European NATO members to make more troops available for deployment in Afghanistan, remove the national caveats (i.e. national restrictions on how, when and where forces can be used) and start sending its troops into the conflict-ridden south of the country. According to Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) General James L. Jones {{it was not the}} lack of combat troops and the caveats were the problem, but the lack of adequate helicopters and military intelligence to support airlift and on-the-ground operations.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the allegations, Sony stated that the game was not based on reality, and they believed they had adequate permissions necessary. They later added that the game was purely entertainment and fictional, comparing it to the television programme Doctor Who. Former <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Tony</b> Blair commented that though companies should have more responsibility and sensitivity to the feelings of others, the issue would be immensely difficult. Although the copyright concerns {{were found to be}} without merit, Sony offered a formal apology to the Church of England and leaders of the cathedral in July 2007, stating that they did not intend to cause offence.|$|E
5|$|A BBC {{documentary}} entitled Panorama: Buying the Games, {{aired in}} August 2004, investigated {{the taking of}} bribes in the bidding process for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The documentary claimed {{it was possible to}} bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city. After being narrowly defeated in their bid for the 2012 Summer Games, Parisian mayor Bertrand Delanoë specifically accused the <b>British</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>Tony</b> Blair and the London Bid Committee (headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe) of breaking the bid rules. He cited French president Jacques Chirac as a witness; Chirac gave guarded interviews regarding his involvement. The allegation was never fully explored. The Turin bid for the 2006 Winter Olympics was also shrouded in controversy. A prominent IOC member, Marc Hodler, strongly connected with the rival bid of Sion, Switzerland, alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organising Committee. These accusations led to a wide-ranging investigation. The allegations also served to sour many IOC members against Sion's bid and potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination.|$|E

2500|$|The {{charitable}} {{status of}} the JNF-UK has come under increasing attack. <b>British</b> <b>prime</b> <b>ministers</b> <b>Tony</b> Blair and Gordon Brown had been Honorary Patrons of the JNF-UK, like all <b>British</b> <b>prime</b> <b>ministers</b> before them since its inception. Confounding expectations, David Cameron resigned as Honorary Patron to JNF-UK in 2011. According to a spokesman, Cameron's surprise refusal {{was due to the}} JNF-UK being an organisation that was specifically focused around work in one specific country—i.e., Israel. Cameron's decision was interpreted as a snub, in spite of the spokesman's assurances that his decision had [...] "absolutely {{nothing to do with any}} anti-Israel campaign". However, campaigners claimed that Cameron's resignation was due to political pressures motivated by the JNF-KKL's discriminatory policies in Israel. Since then, the JNF-UK's Honorary Patrons include no leader of the main British political parties. An Early Day Motion in the British parliament condemning the JNF and calling for the revocation of the JNF's charitable status in the UK was launched in 2011 and by February 2012 had been signed by 66 Members of Parliament. In 2012 the Green Party called for the JNF to be stripped of its charity status and pledged to sign up to a campaign which calls the charity [...] "racist".|$|R

[...] In late 2007, it was revealed that David Abrahams, who was deputy chair of Labour Friends of Israel until 2002, had made secret and illegal donations through junior employees of 600,000 pounds sterling (approximately $1.2 million) to the Labour Party. Abrahams, [...] "a Jewish millionaire," [...] admitted in The Jewish Chronicle that he concealed his activity because [...] "I didn't want Jewish money and the Labour Party being put together." [...] The Telegraph ran a photograph of Abrahams with Israeli former ambassador to Britain, Zvi Heifetz, and [...] "insinuated that Israel was the source of the illegal campaign contributions." [...] According to an article in Haaretz, several in the media have maintained there was a connection between money donated by Zionist Jews and the pro-Israel policy of <b>British</b> <b>prime</b> <b>ministers</b> <b>Tony</b> Blair and Gordon Brown. Jon Benjamin, chief executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, told The Forward [...] "Clearly there is a potential for it to turn against us." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{film was}} financially {{successful}} and generally well-received by critics, and won an Academy Award for sound editing. The fictitious plot attracted substantial criticism; in reality, it was British personnel from [...] who first captured a naval Enigma machine (from [...] in the North Atlantic in May 1941), {{months before the}} United States had even entered the war. The anger over the inaccuracies even reached the <b>British</b> Parliament, where <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Tony</b> Blair stated that the film was an [...] "affront" [...] to British sailors. The film was also criticized for portraying German U-boat crews in a negative light.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} tested {{the degree to}} which attitudes about a {{political}} party would be influenced by {{the context in which the}} party leader was rendered cognitively accessible. A sample of <b>British</b> undergraduates evaluated <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Tony</b> Blair before expressing their opinion about the Labour party. In one condition, the two items were structured such that Blair was expected to be included in participants’ representation of the party. In a second condition, the same items were structured such that Blair was expected to be excluded from participants’ representation of the party. The results supported the hypothesis that manipulating the context in which Blair was made salient would produce different effects on a subsequent judgment of the Labour party, but only among politically ambivalent respondents...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>British</b> Government, and <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Tony</b> Blair {{promised to}} take steps to improve school dinners shortly after the {{programme}} aired. 271,677 people signed an online petition on the Feed Me Better website, which was delivered to 10 Downing Street on 30 March 2005. Certain junk foods (such as the notorious Bernard Matthews [...] "Turkey Twizzlers" [...] much derided on the show) were banned from schools by their local borough or county council.

50|$|In 2005, British chef Jamie Oliver began a {{campaign}} to reduce unhealthy food choices in British schools and to get children more enthused about eating lower calorie nutritious food instead. Oliver's efforts to bring radical change to the school meals system, chronicled in the series Jamie's School Dinners, challenged the junk-food culture by showing schools they could serve healthy, cost-efficient meals that kids enjoyed eating. The <b>British</b> Government and <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Tony</b> Blair promised {{to take steps to}} improve school dinners shortly after the programme aired. The programme prompted 271,677 people to sign an online petition on the Feed Me Better website, which was delivered to 10 Downing Street on 30 March 2005. As a result, the government added an extra £280 million ($316m USD) to help with the school meals plan.
