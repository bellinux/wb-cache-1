25|$|Consistently {{with its}} silence before the election, the PRC {{government}} refrained from commenting {{directly on the}} election results, and PRC media, which follows instructions on reporting from the government, has been very quiet as to {{the result of the}} elections. Also consistently with its behaviour before the election, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China commented on the failure of the two United Nations-related referenda held concurrently with the election, stating that the results showed the lack of popular support for independence in Taiwan. The Bureau also expressed optimism for the two governments to work together to maintain cross-strait peace and aid development in future.

25|$|The Rev. Raymond Davis was {{installed}} as rector of Truro in 1948. He {{said that he}} would <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> if he could, just once, fill all one hundred seats of the little brick church. Not only were all the seats filled, but the growing congregation began to burst at the seams as the great suburban expansion of Northern Virginia began in the 1950s. In 1959, a new and larger church was completed with a seating capacity of 500. The congregation first worshiped in the new church on Palm Sunday, 1959, and when the mortgage was paid off in 1974, a new Truro Church building was consecrated. The old church building is now known as the Chapel. Numerous services are still held throughout the week in the historic chapel, including contemporary worship services.|$|E

25|$|Now, O Lord! Thy servant {{has been}} obedient to the heavenly vision which Thou gavest {{him in his}} native land; and {{under the shadow of}} Thine outstretched arm, he has safely arrived in this place to {{dedicate}} and consecrate this land unto Thee, for the gathering together of Judah's scattered remnants, according to the predictions of the holy Prophets -- for the building up of Jerusalem again after it has been trodden down by the Gentiles so long, and for rearing a Temple in honor of Thy name. Everlasting thanks be ascribed unto Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast preserved Thy servant from the dangers of the seas, and from the plague and pestilence which have caused the land to mourn. The violence of man has also been restrained, and Thy providential care by night and by day has been exercised over Thine unworthy servant. Accept, therefore, O Lord, the tribute of a grateful heart for all past favors, and <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> to continue Thy kindness and mercy towards a needy worm of the dust.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} episode of series three of Ashes to Ashes, {{the nature of his}} death is raised when Alex Drake discovers a witness {{statement}} implied to have been written by Gene Hunt with various parts blacked out, accompanied by Alex seeing visions of a man with injuries to {{the left side of his}} face dressed in police tunic and greatcoat. In the second episode, DCI Jim Keats, an officer from the Discipline and Complaints department, intent on removing Gene Hunt, states he believes Gene killed Sam Tyler. In the fifth episode, Gene destroys Tyler's clothes (which Alex had requested from Manchester) and the censored file in order to prevent her from learning the truth about his death. In the following episode, a suspect who is not only a known fantasist but appears very different physically from Sam tries to convince Alex that he is Sam Tyler after undergoing extensive plastic surgery, and that he is from the future. He quotes Sam's usual speech in the Life on Mars introductions, claiming that nobody else is real, although he still seems to <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> when he, Gene and Alex are in the same room, calling them the 'Three Musketeers', and avoiding Alex's attempts to test him for future knowledge by claiming that such details are forgotten after too long in the past. Gene tells Alex that he helped Sam fake his own death, meaning Sam was still alive but had disappeared into thin air.|$|E
25|$|The Australian captain Ricky Ponting {{brought on}} {{part-time}} spinner Michael Clarke to bowl the 11th over, and got immediate success, when Pietersen launched him to Matthew Hayden {{on the fifth}} ball, but England were still 101 for 3 after 11 overs. In the next over, the new batsman Michael Vaughan edged Andrew Symonds' ball to midwicket, and the pressure was suddenly on the English. With Trescothick out for 41 a bit later to an attempted sweep off Symonds, England were suddenly looking down a hole after a fine start, and Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood slowed the scoring, to see England 111 for 5 with six overs to play. However, a slog sweep from Collingwood to end the 15th over turned the match again, as it went away for six and England moved to 124 for 5. With Jason Gillespie being brought back, Collingwood led the charge, as England stole 17 runs off the 17th over and wrought control of the game again. Despite Andrew Strauss being bowled by Gillespie for 18, Collingwood hit another two boundaries {{towards the end of}} the over, to move onto 42 not out and the team score to 167 for 6. Vikram Solanki was out in the next over for 9, caught by Hussey off McGrath, and on the last ball, Collingwood was caught by for 46. Still, England would <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> with 179 for 8, the highest score on the Rose Bowl in Twenty20 matches.|$|E

25|$|Cicero {{understood}} {{what was going}} on and got Lucius Ninnius Quadratus, a plebeian tribune, to oppose every move of Clodius. The latter, fearing that this could result in disturbances and delays outwitted them by deceit. He agreed with Cicero not to bring an indictment against him. However, when these two men lowered their guard, Clodius proposed a bill to outlaw those who would or had executed any citizen without trial. This brought within its scope the whole of the senate, which had decreed the executions during the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 BC (see above). However, it was actually targeting Cicero, who had received most of the blame because he had proposed the motion and had ordered the executions. Cicero strenuously opposed the bill. He also sought the support of Pompey and Caesar. These two men did not want to appear to have instigated Clodius or to <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> with his motion. Caesar advised Cicero to leave Rome because his life was in danger and offered him to become one of his lieutenants in Gaul so that his departure would not be dishonourable. Pompey advised him that to leave would be an act of desertion and that he should remain in Rome, defend himself and challenge Clodius, who would not achieve anything if he did so because he would help him. He also said that Caesar was giving him bad advice out of enmity. Pompey and Caesar presented opposite views on purpose to deceive Cicero and not give rise to suspicions. Cicero attached himself to Pompey. He also thought that he could count on the consuls. Aulus Gabinius was a friend of his and Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus was amiable and a kin of Caesar.|$|E

[...] In 1924, they pressured Greenfield to resign so Brownlee could replace him; Brownlee scuppered the plot by warning that Greenfield's resignation would be accompanied by his own. [...] A second attempt in 1925 was successful when Wood intervened to convince Brownlee to accept the premiership and Greenfield assured him that he would <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> to be rid of it.
