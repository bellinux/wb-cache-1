5|$|A Test {{match is}} won when one side has scored more runs {{than the total}} runs scored by the {{opposing}} side during their two innings. If both sides have completed <b>both</b> <b>their</b> allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it {{is known as a}} win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If one side scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs scored by the other side in <b>both</b> <b>their</b> innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} {{issue with}} the causeway's identification as a Roman structure {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century was its incorporation of many small bends along its course. Roman military roads are usually straight in <b>both</b> <b>their</b> overall course, and also typically from one vantage point to the next. Both the Foss Way and the Stanegate, roads of established Roman provenance, have sinuous courses similar to Wade's causeway, so the objection is not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{immediately}} threatened, crested and marbled newts suffer from population declines, caused mainly by habitat loss and fragmentation. <b>Both</b> <b>their</b> aquatic breeding sites and the cover-rich, natural landscapes upon which they depend during their terrestrial phase are affected. All species are legally protected in Europe, {{and some of}} their habitats have been designated as special reserves.|$|E
6000|$|... [This next {{speech of}} LOPEZ, {{and the next}} of ALONZO'S, with <b>both</b> [...] <b>their</b> replies, are to be spoken at one time, <b>both</b> raising <b>their</b> voices by little and little, till they bawl, and come up close to {{shoulder}} one another.|$|R
50|$|John Mill {{collated}} and Johann Jakob Wettstein transcribed (1716) {{the text}} of the codex. <b>Both</b> did <b>their</b> editions of the Greek Testament, but they <b>both</b> did <b>their</b> work carelessly. A much better collation was made about 1732 by John Dickinson.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hark!" [...] was {{the reply}} and <b>both</b> {{strained}} <b>their</b> ears. There was a faint crackling of twigs, {{and they felt}} certain it was the bear. But {{it was too dark}} to see anything; so <b>both</b> shouldered <b>their</b> rifles and walked back to camp.|$|R
5|$|Beecher's {{features}} a gourmet cheese shop and café in <b>both</b> <b>their</b> Pike Place Market and Flatiron facility. It {{is considered an}} anchor of the Pike Place Market, {{and has become a}} tourist attraction in its own right. During the day, crowds typically gather in the store, watching through windows as the cheesemakers prepare batches of cheese.|$|E
5|$|Besson's {{previous}} film, The Fifth Element, {{which also}} starred Jovovich, {{was a critical}} and financial success, {{and it had a}} positive influence on <b>both</b> <b>their</b> careers. The Messenger was intended to follow up that success and cement the status of Besson and Jovovich in film. However, the film received mixed reviews from critics and underperformed at the box office, earning just under $67 million on a $60 million budget.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s and '80s (the main era for {{organised}} football-related violence), West Ham gained further notoriety for {{the levels}} of hooliganism in their fan base and antagonistic behaviour towards <b>both</b> <b>their</b> own and rival fans, and the police. During the '70s in particular, rival groups of West Ham fans from neighbouring areas often did battle with each other at games, most often groups from the neighbouring districts of Barking and Dagenham.|$|E

5|$|Ernest Guest married Edith May, {{daughter}} of Thomas Jones of Singapore. The couple met in Johannesburg, {{where she had}} been brought up by an uncle. They had two daughters and twin sons. <b>Both</b> <b>their</b> sons were killed in action in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|In <b>both</b> <b>their</b> {{native and}} {{introduced}} ranges, C.mutica are also synanthropic, being found abundantly in fouling communities in artificial structures like submerged ropes, fishing nets, pilings, docks, buoys, aquaculture equipment, oil rig platforms, ship hulls, and even offshore wind farms. In their introduced ranges (particularly in Europe), they are primarily and even exclusively found inhabiting artificial structures.|$|E
5|$|Ned was so {{supportive}} {{of her career}} plans that Mary reconsidered marriage, although she knew <b>both</b> <b>their</b> parents would disapprove. With her studies completed, Mary and Ned became formally engaged at Easter in 1921, and they were married on 6 April 1922 at Toorak Presbyterian Church. They had three daughters: Mary Cecile (Molly) in 1924, Judith Ann (Judy) in 1926, and Margaret Lyle in 1933. Molly would later become a doctor like her mother.|$|E

5|$|No central {{religious}} authority {{exists to}} impose a particular terminological designation on all practitioners. Hence, different Heathen groups have used different words to describe <b>both</b> <b>their</b> religion and themselves, with these terms often conveying meaning about their socio-political beliefs {{as well as the}} particular Germanic region of pre-Christian Europe from which they draw inspiration.|$|E
5|$|The Flag of Scotland, {{also known}} as the Saint Andrew's Cross or more {{commonly}} The Saltire, is the national flag of Scotland. The Saltire is the correct flag for all individuals and corporate bodies to fly in order to demonstrate <b>both</b> <b>their</b> loyalty and Scottish nationality. It is also, where possible, flown from Scottish Government buildings every day from 8am until sunset, with certain exceptions; for example United Kingdom National Days.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{justice system}} was {{maintained}} by policing sheriffs, investigators, official coroners, and exam-drafted officials who became county magistrates. Song magistrates {{were encouraged to}} apply <b>both</b> <b>their</b> practical knowledge {{as well as the}} written law in making judicial decisions that would promote societal morality. Advancements in early forensic science, a greater emphasis on gathering credible evidence, and careful recording by clerks of autopsy reports and witness testimonies aided authorities in convicting criminals.|$|E

5|$|Two {{other parties}} sought to be {{involved}} in the case as amici curiae, Amnesty International (represented by former Federal Court Justice Ron Merkel), and the Victorian human rights advocacy group the Human Rights Law Resource Centre. However <b>both</b> <b>their</b> applications were rejected, because they could not assist the court in a way in which they could not otherwise be assisted, and their submissions were largely subsumed into submissions made by Lasry in any event.|$|E
5|$|Tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli brought three compounds to Bahrain, {{from which}} drivers {{were allowed to}} choose. The three options for the event were the super-soft, soft and medium compounds, {{the same as for}} the previous round in Australia. Frontrunners Mercedes and Ferrari opted for different strategies in tyre allocation, as Mercedes took only one set of the harder medium tyres for <b>both</b> <b>their</b> drivers, while Ferrari chose three sets at the expense of soft compound tyres.|$|E
5|$|Winner Jordan Lloyd {{and fellow}} HouseGuest Jeff Schroeder competed in The Amazing Race 16 and they {{finished}} in 7th place, then returned for Big Brother 12 {{the following year}} {{to participate in a}} Power of Veto competition, while they later returned as HouseGuests to compete in Big Brother 13 in 2011; they placed 4th and 7th respectively, then returned in Big Brother 16, in which Jeff proposed to Jordan with <b>both</b> <b>their</b> families present.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, Māori were {{discouraged}} from speaking {{their own language}} (te reo Māori) in schools and workplaces and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas. It has recently undergone a process of revitalisation, being declared one of New Zealand's official languages in 1987, and is spoken by 3.7% of the population. There are now Māori language immersion schools and two television channels that broadcast predominantly in Māori. Many places have <b>both</b> <b>their</b> Māori and English names officially recognised.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic beetles use several {{techniques}} for retaining air beneath the water's surface. Diving beetles (Dytiscidae) hold air between the abdomen and the elytra when diving. Hydrophilidae have hairs on their under surface that retain {{a layer of}} air against their bodies. Adult crawling water beetles use <b>both</b> <b>their</b> elytra and their hind coxae (the basal segment of the back legs) in air retention, while whirligig beetles simply carry an air bubble down with them whenever they dive.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in <b>both</b> <b>their</b> genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial cell membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.|$|E
