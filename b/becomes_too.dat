5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{it is not}} only males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, {{although}} most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride <b>becomes</b> <b>too</b> large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, both male and female, may be evicted.|$|E
5|$|Some Overlords {{remain on}} Earth {{to study the}} {{children}} from a safe distance. When the evolved children mentally alter the Moon's rotation and make other planetary manipulations, it <b>becomes</b> <b>too</b> dangerous to remain. The departing Overlords offer to take Rodricks with them, but he chooses to stay to witness Earth's end, and transmit a report of what he sees.|$|E
25|$|The first graves {{were some}} of the city's early settlers, moved from another {{graveyard}} that had <b>become</b> <b>too</b> full. Originally it was run by nearby St. James' Episcopal Church, but when the cemetery <b>became</b> <b>too</b> big an independent Batavia Cemetery Association was formed. It has operated the cemetery ever since.|$|R

5|$|Docter {{began working}} on the story in 2004, {{which was based on}} fantasies of {{escaping}} from life when it <b>becomes</b> <b>too</b> irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. The floating house is attached by a varying number between 10,000 and 20,000 balloons in the film's sequences. Up was Pixar's first film to be presented in Disney Digital 3-D.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Oliver Butterworth {{authored}} a children's book, The Enormous Egg. The {{book and}} a movie adaptation televised in 1968 by the NBC Children's Theatre {{tell the story of}} a boy who finds an enormous egg laid by a hen that hatches a baby Triceratops. The dinosaur, named Uncle Beazley, <b>becomes</b> <b>too</b> big, so the boy brings him to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Beazley is first kept at National Museum of Natural History, but is eventually transferred to the National Zoo's Elephant House because there is a law against stabling large animals in the District of Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The contest {{affects their}} sleep, and the {{remaining}} contestants suffer insomnia. Only the eliminated Kramer can sleep peacefully. Elaine shares a cab ride with Kennedy, and she tells him that she lives Uptown near Jerry in order to extend the ride. She then learns that Kennedy wants to see her, and says he'll drop by Jerry's apartment. Eventually, the pressure <b>becomes</b> <b>too</b> much for her and she is the second person to be knocked out of the contest.|$|E

50|$|The {{agglomeration}} of salt around plant roots {{leads to}} barren white patches in {{the centre of}} many of the thousands of islands, which have <b>become</b> <b>too</b> salty to support plants, aside from the odd salt resistant palm tree. Trees and grasses grow in the sand {{around the edges of the}} islands that have not <b>become</b> <b>too</b> salty yet.|$|R

5|$|There {{are several}} {{well-known}} drugs and toxins that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Although {{any one of}} these toxins inhibits only one enzyme in the electron transport chain, inhibition of any step in this process will halt the rest of the process. For example, if oligomycin inhibits ATP synthase, protons cannot pass back into the mitochondrion. As a result, the proton pumps are unable to operate, as the gradient <b>becomes</b> <b>too</b> strong for them to overcome. NADH is then no longer oxidized and the citric acid cycle ceases to operate because the concentration of NAD+ falls below the concentration that these enzymes can use.|$|E
5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it <b>becomes</b> <b>too</b> irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|The player's {{character}} gradually loses sanity when {{he looks}} directly at upsetting aspects of the game world. The character's mental degradation can lead him to hearing hallucinations and visions, which manifest as graphical anomalies and sound distortion, and changes in control sensitivity. If the character <b>becomes</b> <b>too</b> unsettled, results may include his permanent insanity or suicide, and a game over. The sanity can be restored through finding areas of sanctuary or defeating enemies. The areas marked with the Elder Signs serve as sanctuaries against the enemies and as save points. To enhance its replayability value, the game features a system whereby players can gain Mythos Points, supposed to reflect a level of gained knowledge. Such points {{can be used to}} unlock in-game bonuses, such as additional information and items.|$|E

5|$|Weight {{loss and}} eating {{difficulties}} due to dysphagia and other muscle discoordination are common, making nutrition management increasingly {{important as the}} disease advances. Thickening agents {{can be added to}} liquids as thicker fluids are easier and safer to swallow. Reminding the affected person to eat slowly and to take smaller pieces of food into the mouth may also be of use to prevent choking. If eating <b>becomes</b> <b>too</b> hazardous or uncomfortable, the option of using a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is available. This is a feeding tube, permanently attached through the abdomen into the stomach, which reduces the risk of aspirating food and provides better nutritional management. Assessment and management by speech-language pathologists with experience in Huntington's disease is recommended.|$|E
5|$|The reader {{progressively}} learns their history. Dobroselova originally {{lived in}} the country, but moved to St. Petersburg (which she hates) when her father lost his job. Her father becomes very violent and her mother severely depressed. Her father dies and they move in with Anna Fyodorovna, a landlady who was previously cruel to them but at least pretends to feel sympathy for their situation. Dobroselova is tutored by a poor student named Pokrovsky, whose drunken father occasionally visits. She eventually {{falls in love with}} Pokrovsky. She struggles to save a measly amount of money to purchase the complete works of Pushkin at the market for his birthday present, then allows his father to give the books to him instead, claiming that just knowing he received the books will be enough for her happiness. Pokrovsky falls ill soon after, and his dying wish is to see the sun and the world outside. Dobroselova obliges by opening the blinds to reveal grey clouds and dirty rain. In response Pokrovsky only shakes his head and then passes away. Dobroselova's mother dies shortly afterwards, and Dobroselova is left in the care of Anna for a time, but the abuse <b>becomes</b> <b>too</b> much and she goes to live with Fedora across the street.|$|E
25|$|For {{very high}} {{precision}} calculations, when series expansion convergence <b>becomes</b> <b>too</b> slow, trigonometric functions can {{be approximated by}} the arithmetic-geometric mean, which itself approximates the trigonometric function by the (complex) elliptic integral.|$|E

25|$|Water in {{the tank}} is {{slightly}} pre-heated by the boiler, which reduces the loss of pressure found when cold feedwater is injected into the boiler. However, if the water <b>becomes</b> <b>too</b> hot, injectors lose efficiency and can fail. For this reason, the tanks often stopped short of the hotter and uninsulated smokebox.|$|E

This building <b>became</b> <b>too</b> small following Fayetteville's rapid post-World War II growth.|$|R
