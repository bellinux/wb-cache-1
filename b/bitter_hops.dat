50|$|Helles-style beers {{typically}} are full-bodied, mildly sweet, and light-colored, with low bitterness. The beer is clear due to filtration prior to bottling, although some restaurants and breweries do offer an unfiltered version. Munich-style Helles is a yellow beer brewed with bottom-fermenting yeast, <b>bitter</b> <b>hops</b> such as Hallertau hops, and a original specific gravity (prior to fermentation) between 1.044 and 1.053 (11 to 13 degrees plato, and between 4.5 and 6% alcohol by volume. Helles has a less-pronounced hop flavor than pilsner beers.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{the study}} is to {{establish}} the dependence of the bitterness of mash and the beer intoxication on {{the quality and quantity of}} the homologues of alpha acids in the Ukrainian varieties of hops, and on the content of cohumulone in alpha acids in particular. Materials and methods.

50|$|San Diego County brewers {{produce the}} full range of craft beers, but they are best known for strongly-hopped, high-alcohol beers such as India Pale Ale (IPA), and {{particularly}} for an even stronger, hoppier style known as Double IPA. Double IPA beers are made with intensely aromatic, <b>bitter</b> <b>hops,</b> which result in a very bitter beer. A standard mass-produced American beer scores less than 20 on the International Bitterness Units (IBU) scale; an average IPA scores about 60 IBU; and a double IPA commonly scores 100 IBU or higher. The style was pioneered by brewer Vinnie Cilurzo at the now-defunct Blind Pig Brewery in Temecula in 1994; nowadays almost every brewery in San Diego County produces a double IPA. Double IPA has been called San Diego's signature beer, and some people refer to Double IPA beers as San Diego Pale Ale.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{differentiate}} hop pellets by essential oil analysis. Volatile compounds of five aromatic cultivars (Styrie, Saaz, Lublin, Mount Hood, and Hallertau) and seven bitter cultivars (Northern Brewer, Nugget, Pride of Ringwood, Northdown, Galena, Target, and Challenger) were extracted with a Likens-Nickerson simultaneous solvent extractor. The extracts had a strong hop aroma that varied according to the type of hop. Approximately 100 compounds were separated by gas chromatography (GC) and identified by GC-mass spectrometry. An identification flowchart including seven terpenic compounds, four esters, and one methyl ketone was established to discriminate between fresh samples of the 12 investigated cultivars. High amounts of bergamotene and farnesene were found only in Saaz, Lublin, and Styrie samples.

50|$|Because Wakatu is a dual-purpose hop, {{it can be}} used in Single Malt and Single Hop (also {{known as}} SMaSH) beer recipes with {{excellent}} results.Because of the middle road that was taken between this hop possessing high aroma and high alpha rating, it has a slightly lower alpha rating than some other hop varieties, generally in the range of 6%-9%. Put simply, this translates to a lower bittering potential when compared to dedicated <b>bittering</b> <b>hops,</b> but also offers the advantage of being able to contribute aromatics to the beer, to which non-dual-purpose <b>bittering</b> <b>hops</b> aren't so well suited.Wakatu hops have a distinct presence of myrcene measured to be at 35.5% or even up to 59%.

5000|$|The {{effect of}} hops on the {{finished}} beer varies by type and use, {{though there are}} two main <b>hop</b> types: <b>bittering</b> and aroma. <b>Bittering</b> <b>hops</b> have higher concentrations of alpha acids, and are responsible for the large majority of the bitter flavor of a beer. European (so-called [...] "noble") hops typically average 5-9% alpha acids by weight (AABW), and the newer American cultivars typically range from 8-19% AABW. Aroma hops usually have a lower concentration of alpha acids (~5%) and are the primary contributors of hop aroma and (nonbitter) flavor. <b>Bittering</b> <b>hops</b> are boiled {{for a longer period of}} time, typically 60-90 minutes, to maximize the isomerization of the alpha acids. They often have inferior aromatic properties, as the aromatic compounds evaporate off during the boil.|$|R
40|$|Polish cultivars of hop (Humulus lupulus L.) {{are well}} known as aroma and bitter raw {{material}} in the brewing industry. To characterise four popular Polish hop cultivars, Lubelski (Lublin), Marynka, Sybilla and Iunga (also known as Junga), the essential oil profiles were determined by gas chromatography/flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography/chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (GC-CIMS) and the alpha/beta acids amounts by high-performance liquid chromatography/diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) analysis. In addition, the multivariate statistical analysis of the volatile profiles was performed. The results obtained evidenced qualitative and quantitative differences between the four cultivars studied and the foreign hops described in the literature. Lubelski and Iunga showed the typical chemical profile of the fine-aroma and high-alpha cultivars, respectively. In Marynka and Sybilla, the average amounts of alpha acids were similar to the <b>bitter</b> <b>hops,</b> but with a volatile profile characteristics of the fine-aroma and aroma cultivars respectively. �� 2013 Institute of Food Science and Technology...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{stability}} during storage of several compounds previously described for distinguishing hop varieties. Volatile compounds of five aromatic cultivars (Styrie, Saaz, Lublin, Mount Hood, and Hallertau) and six bitter cultivars (Northern Brewer, Nugget, Pride of Ringwood, Northdown, Target, and Challenger), stored at different temperatures, were extracted with a Likens-Nickerson simultaneous solvent extractor. Only compounds remaining stable through aging were kept to build an identification flowchart. Although very typical of fresh aromatic hops, farnesene proved much too unstable to be selected for distinguishing aged samples. 3 -Methylbutylisobutyrate, which authenticates all fresh European <b>bitter</b> <b>hops,</b> is also partially destroyed upon storage. On the other hand, bergamotene, alpha- and beta -selinene, methyl geranate, humulene epoxide II, alpha -amorphene, 2 -undecanone, and an unknown compound can be used to distinguish all cultivars whatever the storage temperature. Both the ratios of humulene to humulene + humulene epoxides (I, II, and III) and of bergamotene to farnesene proved good indicators of the freshness status of hop samples...|$|E

50|$|Humulene {{is one of}} the {{components}} of the essential oil from the flowering cone of the hops plant, Humulus lupulus, from which it derives its name. The concentration of humulene varies among different varieties of the plant but can be up to 40% of the essential oil.

5000|$|The {{first step}} in wort {{production}} is to make malt from dried, sprouted barley. The malt is then run through a roller mill and cracked. This cracked grain is then mashed, that is, mixed with hot water and steeped, a slow heating process that enables enzymes to convert the starch in the malt into sugars. At set intervals, most notably when the mixture has reached temperatures of 45, 62 and 73 °C (113, 144 and 163 °F), the heating is briefly halted. The temperature of the mixture is usually increased to 78 °C (172 °F) for mashout. Lautering is the next step, which means the sugar-extracted grist or solids remaining in the mash are separated from the liquid wort. In homebrewing, the malt-making and mashing steps can be skipped by adding malt extract to water. The mixture is then boiled to sanitize the wort and, {{in the case of}} most beer production, to extract the bittering, flavour and aroma from hops. In beer making, the wort is known as [...] "sweet wort" [...] until the hops have been added, after which it is called [...] "hopped or bitter wort". The addition of hops is generally done in three parts at set times. The <b>bittering</b> <b>hops,</b> added first, are boiled in the wort for approximately one hour to one and a half hours. This long boil extracts resins, which provides the bittering. Then, the flavouring hops are added, typically 15 minutes {{from the end of the}} boil. The finishing hops are added last, toward the end of or after the boil. This extracts the oils, which provide flavour and aroma but evaporate quickly. In general, hops provide the most flavouring when boiled for approximately 15 minutes, and the most aroma when not boiled at all.|$|R
40|$|Bitter acids (BA) {{from the}} hop plant Humulus lupulus L. exhibit {{multiple}} beneficial biological properties. However, no studies are available regarding {{the effects of}} <b>hop</b> <b>bitter</b> acids on liver cells or chronic liver diseases, respectively. Chronic liver diseases are accompanied by chronic hepatic inflammation {{which can lead to}} liver fibrosis. If left untreated, liver fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis, which can cause liver failure. Importantly, cirrhosis is also the main risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Both cirrhosis and HCC are associated with high morbidity and mortality, and up until now, no effective treatment options are available. The aim of this thesis was to assess the effects of BA on hepatic stellate cells, the central mediators of liver fibrosis, and on hepatocellular carcinoma cells. First, the effects of <b>hop</b> <b>bitter</b> acids on hepatic stellate cells (HSC) were analyzed. HSC were isolated from murine and human liver tissues and were incubated with a standardized <b>hop</b> <b>bitter</b> acid extract. At a concentration of 25 µg/ml <b>hop</b> <b>bitter</b> acids (BA) started to induce lactate dehydrogenase leakage. Already at lower concentrations BA led to a dose dependent inhibition of HSC proliferation and inhibited IkappaB-alpha-phosphorylation and nuclear p 65 translocation in a dose dependent way. Accordingly, the same doses of BA inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory and NFkappaB-regulated genes, but did not affect expression of genes not related to NFkappaB signaling. In addition to these effects on activated HSC, BA inhibited the in vitro activation of non-activated HSC as evidenced by delayed expression of collagen I and alpha-sma mRNA and protein. Together, these findings indicate that BA inhibit NFkappaB activation, and herewith, the activation and development of pro-fibrogenic phenotype of HSC in vitro. Next, we analyzed the effects of BA on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Here, we used two different standardized BA extracts enriched for either alpha-acids or beta-acids to get a first insight whether biological activity vary between these two groups of bitter acids. At a concentration of 25 µg/ml, only the beta-acid rich extract started to induce aspartate aminotransferase (AST) release as marker for cell injury, whereas at a dose of 50 µg/ml both extracts led to a significant increase of AST liberation. Already at lower concentrations both extracts dose-dependently inhibited proliferation and migration of HCC cells. Analysis of different signaling pathways revealed an inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation, down-regulation of AP- 1 activity and an alleviation of NFkappaB activity in HCC cells in vitro. Hereby, the beta-acid rich extract showed more pronounced effects. Furthermore, the stability of BA in a rodent chow supplemented with an alpha-acid rich extract was assessed applying high pressure liquid chromatography diode array detection technology. Mimicking feasible storage conditions we observed a very poor recovery, indicative of a strong degradation of BA. This prompted us not to proceed with application of this particular BA supplemented chow in rodent models, since in addition to imprecise BA-concentration also potential ill-defined degradation products would not have allowed a sound interpretation of such studies. In conclusion, <b>hop</b> <b>bitter</b> acids alleviate the pro-fibrogenic phenotype of hepatic stellate cells and inhibit central signaling pathways, which are known to play important roles in tumor development and progression, in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. These data suggest the potential use of <b>hop</b> <b>bitter</b> acids as functional nutrient or therapeutical agent for both prevention and treatment of chronic liver diseases. Further studies are needed to verify the beneficial effects in experimental models of liver injury in vivo. However, analysis of a newly designed BA-supplemented experimental chow for rodents revealed strong degradation processes even under optimal storage conditions. Therefore, special care has to be taken when planning long term BA-application experiments. ...|$|R
