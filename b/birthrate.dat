5|$|The 1963 census {{indicated}} that 47% of Nigerians were Muslim, 35% Christian, and 18% members of local indigenous congregations. If accurate, this indicated a sharp increase since 1953 {{in the number}} of Christians (up 23%); a decline among those professing indigenous beliefs, compared with 20%; and only a modest (6%) drop of Muslims which can likely be attributed to immigration, emigration, and <b>birthrate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historians {{generally}} {{agree that}} a dramatic reduction in the overall size of the Congolese population occurred during the two-decades of Free State rule in the Congo. Populations always fluctuate over time and notable shifts, known as demographic crises, are well-attested in pre-industrial societies. Noted examples include the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. It is argued that {{the reduction in the}} Congo was atypical and {{can be attributed to the}} direct and indirect effects of colonial rule and especially to disease and falling <b>birthrate.</b> Estimates of the size of the overall population decline (or mortality displacement) remain disputed but range between two and 13 million.|$|E

5|$|Yet another {{trait that}} sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their <b>birthrate,</b> maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live {{twice as long as}} they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (senescence) and still be capable of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor Diocletian (r. 284–305) {{split the}} empire into {{separately}} administered {{eastern and western}} halves in 286; the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers, as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other. In 330, {{after a period of}} civil war, Constantine the Great (r. 306–337) refounded the city of Byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital, Constantinople. Diocletian's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy, reformed taxation, and strengthened the army, which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing: excessive taxation, a declining <b>birthrate,</b> and pressures on its frontiers, among others. Civil war between rival emperors became common {{in the middle of the}} 4th century, diverting soldiers from the empire's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach. For much of the 4th century, Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period, with a widening gulf between the rich and poor, and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns. Another change was the Christianisation, or conversion of the empire to Christianity, a gradual process that lasted from the 2nd to the 5th centuries.|$|E

25|$|One major {{long-term}} {{concern for}} the Japanese labor force is its low <b>birthrate.</b> In {{the first half of}} 2005, the number of deaths in Japan exceeded the number of births, indicating that the decline in population, initially predicted to start in 2007, had already started. While one countermeasure for a declining <b>birthrate</b> would be to remove barriers to immigration, despite taking new steps towards it, the Japanese government has been reluctant to do so, since foreign immigration to Japan has been unpopular among citizens.|$|E

25|$|For some years, {{there has}} been a {{perception}} both in Britain and in Ireland that the Catholic <b>birthrate</b> will guarantee a Catholic – and hence supposedly Nationalist – majority in Northern Ireland {{at some point in the}} first half of the 21st century.

25|$|From {{at least}} the mid-republican era, an official, joint cult to Ceres and Proserpina {{reinforced}} Ceres' connection with Roman ideals of female virtue. The promotion of this cult coincides {{with the rise of}} a plebeian nobility, an increased <b>birthrate</b> among plebeian commoners, and a fall in the <b>birthrate</b> among patrician families. The late Republican Ceres Mater (Mother Ceres) is described as genetrix (progenitress) and alma (nourishing); in the early Imperial era she becomes an Imperial deity, and receives joint cult with Ops Augusta, Ceres' own mother in Imperial guise and a bountiful genetrix in her own right. Several of Ceres' ancient Italic precursors are connected to human fertility and motherhood; the Pelignan goddess Angitia Cerealis has been identified with the Roman goddess Angerona (associated with childbirth).|$|E
25|$|In 1957, Romania legalized abortion, but in 1966, after {{a decline}} in the {{national}} <b>birthrate,</b> Nicolae Ceauşescu approved Decree 770, which criminalized abortion and encouraged childbirth.

40|$|The super-Eddington wind {{scenario}} {{has been}} proposed as an alternative way for producing type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The super-Eddington wind can naturally prevent the carbon [...] oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) with high mass-accretion rates from becoming red-giant-like stars. Furthermore, it works in low-metallicity environments, which may explain SNe Ia observed at high redshifts. In this article, we systematically investigated the most prominent single-degenerate WD+MS channel based on the super-Eddington wind scenario. We combined the Eggleton stellar evolution code with a rapid binary population synthesis (BPS) approach to predict SN Ia <b>birthrates</b> for the WD+MS channel by adopting the super-Eddington wind scenario and detailed mass-accumulation efficiencies of H-shell flashes on the WDs. Our BPS calculations found that the estimated SN Ia <b>birthrates</b> for the WD+MS channel are ~ 0. 009 - 0. 315 * 10 ^{- 3 }{yr}^{- 1 } if we adopt the Eddington accretion rate as the critical accretion rate, which are much {{lower than that of}} the observations (< 10 % of the observed SN Ia <b>birthrates).</b> This indicates that the WD+MS channel only contributes a small proportion of all SNe Ia. The <b>birthrates</b> in this simulation are lower than previous studies, the main reason of which is that new mass-accumulation efficiencies of H-shell flashes are adopted. We also found that the critical mass-accretion rate has a significant influence on the <b>birthrates</b> of SNe Ia. Meanwhile, the results of our BPS calculations are sensitive to the values of the common-envelope ejection efficiency.

40|$|This article empirically assesses whether age-restricted {{access to}} {{abortion}} and the birth control pill influence minors’ fertility in the United States.

Wade decision enabled minors to legally consent to surgical treatment—including abortion—in some states but not in others, and to construct abortion access variables reflecting this. In this article, age-specific policy variables measure either a minor’s legal ability to obtain an abortion or to obtain the birth control pill without parental involvement.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the {{progenitors}} of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is still uncertain. The core-degenerate (CD) scenario has been proposed as an alternative way {{for the production of}} SNe Ia. In this scenario, SNe Ia are formed at the final stage of common-envelope evolution from a merger of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) with the CO core of an asymptotic giant branch companion. However, the <b>birthrates</b> of SNe Ia from this scenario are still not well determined. In this work, we performed a detailed investigation on the CD scenario based on a binary population synthesis approach. The SN Ia delay times from this scenario are basically in the range of 90 Myr- 2500 Myr, mainly contributing to the observed SNe Ia with short and intermediate delay times although this scenario can also produce some old SNe Ia. Meanwhile, our work indicates that the Galactic <b>birthrates</b> of SNe Ia from this scenario are no more than 20 % of total SNe Ia due to more careful treatment of mass transfer. Although the SN Ia <b>birthrates</b> in the present work are lower than those in Ilkov & Soker, the CD scenario cannot be ruled out as a viable mechanism for the formation of SNe Ia. Especially, SNe Ia with circumstellar material from this scenario contribute to 0. 7 - 10 % of total SNe Ia, which means that the CD scenario can reproduce the observed <b>birthrates</b> of SNe Ia like PTF 11 kx. We also found that SNe Ia happen systemically earlier for a high value of metallicity and their <b>birthrates</b> increase with metallicity.
