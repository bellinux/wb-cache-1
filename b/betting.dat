5|$|According to The Washington Times writer Rick Snyder, Vogel did {{not know}} the horse racing {{business}} and made mistakes that negatively affected the industry in Maryland. The year-round racing Rosecroft was awarded lowered the excitement for the locals. Rosecroft was not capable of attracting a new market, and attendance figures declined. He never focused on marketing or daily operations of Rosecroft. Instead, Vogel focused more on his real estate business. As a result, the attendance dropped. Vogel took out money from the <b>betting</b> pools to help his real estate business. Lower <b>betting</b> pools mean smaller payouts for the bettors and less profit for the racetrack owners. Vogel never formed political ties to help pass legislation used to help harness racing, more specially to allow off-track <b>betting</b> and to lower the state tax on <b>betting</b> pools.|$|E

5|$|Lewis and Audrey go {{on holiday}} to Greece {{together}} and Lewis suggests they move there and open a hotel. Audrey agrees {{and gets a}} Â£100,000 loan towards {{the purchase of the}} hotel. Lewis, needing money of his own, decides to steal from Peter Barlow's <b>betting</b> shop with fraudulently franked <b>betting</b> slips. He begins flirting with Deirdre Barlow, an employee at the <b>betting</b> shop. Lewis sends Deirdre out of the shop to get a corkscrew so they can share a bottle of wine. He places his fraudulent <b>betting</b> slips in the till and when Deirdre returns, he kisses her to distract her. Lewis slips out of Audrey's farewell party to collect his money and he leaves for the airport. Peter discovers Lewis has stolen from him and Audrey is devastated by his disappearance. She discovers Lewis has left her money alone and she finds a photograph of them with the words 'I tried' written on the back. While he is in the airport bar waiting for his flight to Barbados, Lewis introduces himself to Lydia Radcliffe and offers to sit with her during the flight.|$|E

50|$|The utility {{function}} for perceived gains has two key properties: an upward slope, and concavity. (i) The upward slope {{implies that the}} person feels that more is better: a larger amount received yields greater utility, and for risky <b>bets</b> the person would prefer a <b>bet</b> which is first-order stochastically dominant over an alternative <b>bet</b> (that is, if the probability mass of the second <b>bet</b> is pushed {{to the right to}} form the first <b>bet,</b> then the first <b>bet</b> is preferred). (ii) The concavity of the {{utility function}} implies that the person is risk averse: a sure amount would always be preferred over a risky <b>bet</b> having the same expected value; moreover, for risky <b>bets</b> the person would prefer a <b>bet</b> which is a mean-preserving contraction of an alternative <b>bet</b> (that is, if some of the probability mass of the first <b>bet</b> is spread out without altering the mean to form the second <b>bet,</b> then the first <b>bet</b> is preferred).|$|R
50|$|A simpler {{approach}} is to <b>bet</b> up to a maximum amount in the pot. So in the above example, the first seen player may <b>bet</b> a minimum of $20 and a maximum of $60. If he does <b>bet</b> the maximum, the next player may <b>bet</b> a minimum of $60 {{to a maximum of}} $120. If he <b>bets</b> the maximum, the next player would then be entitled to <b>bet</b> a minimum of $120 and a maximum of $240. Note: In this example, for the later <b>bets,</b> the maximum <b>bet</b> is twice that of minimum <b>bet</b> because of the chosen ante and forced blind <b>bet</b> amounts. For other combinations, this relationship may not hold.|$|R
50|$|The dealer {{will place}} the odds {{on top of}} the come <b>bet,</b> but {{slightly}} off center in order to differentiate between the original <b>bet</b> and the odds. The second round wins if the shooter rolls the come <b>bet</b> point again before a seven. Winning come <b>bets</b> are paid the same as winning pass line bets: even money for the original <b>bet</b> and true odds for the odds <b>bet.</b> If, instead, the seven is rolled before the come-bet point, the come <b>bet</b> (and any odds <b>bet)</b> loses.|$|R

5|$|Although other breeds {{were being}} {{increasingly}} imported and bred, {{the numbers of}} the Finnhorse population also slowly began to recover; in 1997, 19,000 Finnhorses existed. Harness racing and associated parimutuel <b>betting,</b> {{and to some degree}} also the relatively new hobby of riding, became the most important factors ensuring the survival of the breed.|$|E
50|$|A don't pass <b>bet</b> is a <b>bet</b> for {{the shooter}} to lose ("seven out, line away") and {{is almost the}} {{opposite}} of the pass line <b>bet.</b> Like the Pass <b>bet,</b> this <b>bet</b> must be at least the table minimum and at most the table maximum.|$|R
50|$|Five celebrities started each tournament with $100,000 in tournament {{chips and}} played 21 hands of blackjack. Minimum <b>bets</b> were $1,000 and maximum <b>bets</b> were $25,000 {{for the first}} ten hands. For hand 11-20, the minimum <b>bet</b> was $5,000 {{and there was no}} maximum <b>bet.</b> Double down for less is permitted. All <b>bets</b> {{throughout}} the tournament MUST be in $1,000 increments. A player cannot <b>bet</b> the remaining $500 which it would count as an all-in <b>bet</b> when the minimum <b>bet</b> is $5,000. However, a player may use the remaining $500 for the insurance. Insurance pays 2 to 1. Blackjack pays 3 to 2. The <b>bets</b> for the 21st and final hand were secret, with each player writing the <b>bet</b> out prior to the hand being played.|$|R
50|$|The total <b>bet</b> can {{be divided}} into two {{components}} - the call and the raise, both being usually called as Chaal. Each player has to place a <b>bet</b> that is at least equal to the previous player's <b>bet,</b> with the option of raising the <b>bet.</b> This <b>bet</b> then becomes the (new) current level of <b>bet</b> (Chaal). Usually there is a limit imposed to the raise, such that the total <b>bet</b> amount (with the call and the raise) cannot exceed twice that of the previous player's <b>bet.</b> Also, the <b>bet</b> should be in even amounts (2,4,6,8..), especially when there is one player still in the game as Blind player. It is because the player playing blind plays half of the normal <b>bet,</b> and odd amounts can't be halved.|$|R
5|$|As {{their plans}} to emigrate step up a gear, Lewis forges a plan to steal money from Peter Barlow's (Chris Gascoyne) <b>betting</b> shop by cashing fraudulently franked <b>betting</b> slips. His scam is successful, and he cheats on Audrey when he kisses Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride). Lewis flees the UK; he made his last {{appearance}} on 13 August 2010. Just over a year later, it was announced Havers would reprise his role as Lewis and return to Coronation Street in February 2012. Havers believed Lewis would be a changed man who wanted to apologise to those he had hurt. The character's first period in the show was well received by television critics. On 22 January 2013, {{it was announced that}} Havers would be leaving Coronation Street once again and Lewis departed on 1 February 2013.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, the Huntington Development Corporation {{suggested}} that an off-track <b>betting</b> facility be constructed, however, the idea died after Governor Arch Moore vetoed an off-track <b>betting</b> bill that was critical to the project's success. In 1987, the Webb Companies presented {{a plan for a}} $110 million mixed-use complex called RiverCenter that would feature a 20-story office tower, an underground parking garage and a skyway to the Harris Riverfront Park. The project failed when two large tenants could not be found to anchor the project. In 1988, the city's grant to help develop the project was revoked.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, {{he wrote}} an anti-gambling {{resolution}} {{into the league}} constitution, which empowered him {{with the ability to}} permanently ban any NFL associated personnel for <b>betting</b> on a game or for withholding information on a game being possibly fixed. Furthermore, to obstruct gamblers from getting inside information, he secreted the names of officials he would assign to games, and he directed each team to promulgate a precursory injury report which listed anyone who might not participate in a game. Eventually, he lobbied to get every state in the US to criminalize the fixing of sporting events and put employees on the payroll of the NFL to investigate potential <b>betting</b> scams.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian {{government}} {{has a number of}} border disputes with neighbouring countries, of which several concern Sarawak. This includes land and maritime disputes with neighbouring Brunei. In 2009, Malaysian prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi claimed that in a meeting with Sultan of Brunei, Brunei agreed to drop its claim over Limbang. This was however denied by the second Foreign Minister of Brunei Lim Jock Seng, stating the issue was never discussed during the meeting. James Shoal (<b>Betting</b> Serupai) and the Luconia Shoals (<b>Betting</b> Raja Jarum/Patinggi Ali), islands in the South China Sea, fall within Sarawak's exclusive economic zone, but concerns have been raised about Chinese incursions. There are also several SarawakâKalimantan border issues with Indonesia.|$|E
