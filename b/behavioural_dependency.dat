40|$|The {{multiple}} {{elements of}} episodic events, represented in distinct neocortical regions, {{are thought to}} be bound into coherent ‘event engrams ’ by the hippocampus (Damasio, 1989; Tulving, 1983). These engrams should allow for the retrieval of all event elements via pattern completion, resulting in their ‘reinstatement ’ in the neocortex (Marr, 1971). We have previously shown <b>behavioural</b> <b>dependency</b> between retrieval of different elements of the same event (Horner & Burgess, 2013). For example, for location-person-object events, if we remember the location of a specific event we should be more likely to remember the person and object from that same event. We have further shown that this <b>behavioural</b> <b>dependency</b> is due to pattern completion at retrieval, rather than fluctuations in encoding strength (Horner & Burgess, 2014). Here we ask whether pattern completion is related to hippocampal activity and whether it results in the reinstatement of event elements in the neocortex. In an fMRI experiment, participants learned events consisting of distinct elements (locations, people and objects/animals). At retrieval, each pairwise association of each event was tested. At encoding, hippocampal activity predicts subsequent memory performance for all within-event elements, supporting the idea that the hippocampus bind...|$|E

Further, this dependency is due to pattern completion at retrieval, rather than fluctuations in encoding strength (5). Pattern completion was also seen when the overlapping pairwise associations of an event were presented separately, but only when all possible within-event pairs were encoded, forming a ‘closed-loop ’ associative structure, but not when incomplete ‘open-loop ’ sets of pairs were encoded. Using fMRI, we asked whether pattern completion is related to hippocampal activity and whether it results in the reinstatement of event elements in the neocortex. Participants learned events consisting of multiple distinct elements via separate presentation of overlapping pairwise associations. At retrieval, all pairs from each event were tested. Durin...|$|E

Selection of wrong effort estimation can delay project completion and can incur unnecessary cost also. The aim {{of this paper is}} to provide a basis to improve the process of prediction of change prone classes. This paper reports a systematic review of papers published in journals and conference proceedings. The review investigates methodologies for predicting change prone class and fault prone class. The key findings of the review are: (1) <b>behavioural</b> <b>dependency</b> has been widely used for prediction of the change prone class, (2) there is need to develop a framework comprising of more features to accurately predict change prone class. This paper provides an extensive review of studies related to change proneness of software.

This paper introduces an activity model for the declarative specification of such communication behaviour, including the temporal ordering of message exchanges within the object communications, and the behavioural relationships between activity executions. We develop two formal mechanisms: activity specialization and activity aggregation for abstract implementation of object communication in order to allow expressing complex behaviour in terms of simpler behaviour.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Problematic Internet use and {{excessive}} alcohol consumption {{have been associated}} with a host of maladaptive outcomes. Further, low (blunted) cardiovascular and stress hormone (e. g. cortisol) reactions to acute psychological stress are a feature of individuals with a range of adverse health and <b>behavioural</b> characteristics, including <b>dependencies</b> such as tobacco and alcohol addiction. The present study extended this research by examining whether <b>behavioural</b> <b>dependencies,</b> namely problematic Internet use, excessive alcohol consumption, and their comorbidity would also be associated with blunted stress reactivity Methods A large sample of university students (N = 2313) were screened using Internet and alcohol dependency questionnaires to select four groups for laboratory testing: comorbid Internet and alcohol dependence (N = 17), Internet dependence (N = 17), alcohol dependence (N = 28), and non-dependent controls (N = 26). Cardiovascular activity and salivary cortisol were measured at rest and in response to a psychological stress protocol comprising of mental arithmetic and public speaking tasks. Results Neither problematic Internet behaviour nor excessive alcohol consumption, either individually or in combination, were associated with blunted cardiovascular or cortisol stress reactions. Discussion It is possible that problematic Internet behaviour and excessive alcohol consumption in a student population were not related to physiological reactivity as they may not reflect ingrained addictions but rather an impulse control disorder and binging tendency. Conclusions The present results serve to indicate some of the limits of the developing hypothesis that blunted stress reactivity is a peripheral marker of the central motivational dysregulation in the brain underpinning a wide range of health and behavioural problems. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} climatic and feeding factors that influence foraging, resting and comfort behaviour in Arabian horses which are kept under natural conditions on pasture. Another aim was to study if the horses spatially separate their behaviours. All-year pasture farming under natural conditions best corresponds to the horses' nature if based upon appropriate and useful management. Over one year, changes in behaviour and use of pasturage in 10 horses have been observed and recorded. 24 -hour-observations were carried out on 36 days of the year. On 5 days of each month the horses were observed from sunrise to sunset. Special attention was paid to possible changes in behaviour under the impact of external stressors which might have influenced modality, intensity and frequency of various behaviour patterns in the individual and the group. Climatic data were recorded by an electronic weather device. The characteristics of the 24 -hour-time budget was recorded on yearly and daily basis. The frequency of a particular behaviour and the average duration of action were determined for each horse. Frequency and average duration of each behaviour were recorded and later determined for the whole period of observation (one year), the 24 -hour-time budget, and the day and night rhythm. Behavioural changes, influenced by climatic and feeding conditions, were determined by comparing them with the average diurnal rhythm of one year. The horses spent 57 - 72 % of their 24 -hour-time budget feeding, 23 - 36 % resting and 0, 05 - 0, 3 % self- and mutual-grooming. 1 - 6 % of the time was used for locomotion's other than those specifically observed in this study. Monthly variations in time spent grazing and feeding hay in individual horses can be put down to the changing amount of hay available, rather than the general vegetation situation, also proving the dependency of feeding behaviour on social bonds. These significant individual differences could be observed with help of the mean grazing frequency of 7 - 11 times a day with an average duration of 17 - 34 minutes per action. Hay feeding was documented with a frequency of 16 - 24 times a day, lasting 21 - 37 minutes each. Individual action patterns could also be observed in other kinds of behaviour. During their 24 -hour-time budget the horses rested 13 - 23 times from 19 to 26 minutes each time. Recumbent rest was observed 1 to 2 times a day for 15 - 30 minutes. Comfort behaviour patterns could not be observed daily, but if so, the horses spent 1 - 5 minutes for self- or mutual-grooming. Locomotor activities other than the studied behaviours, were observed 14 - 25 times, 2 to 3 minutes each. According to the different frequency and duration of actions, each horse showed completely different season-related behaviour rhythms. The bigger number of horses was feeding in the daytime. The feeding rhythms changed over the year according to the different light conditions. Main time for grazing was between 7 : 00 and 19 : 00 with a frequency of 6 - 9 times and took up 17 - 32 minutes each. At night the horses were grazing 1 - 3 times for 7 to 19 minutes. Hay was the preferred food at night. Leading horses showed clearly recognizable behaviour in hay feeding by following the light and dark phases over the year, whereas lower-ranking horses showed a very unstructured feeding behaviour over 24 hours like bigger differences in duration of each action. In the day time, the horses spend 21 - 45 minutes hay feeding - 7 to 14 times. At darkness hay feeding took place 9 - 11 times with a mean duration of each action from 24 to 42 minutes. The horses exhibited longer periods of resting behaviour by night. The beginning of their main resting period changed in the course of the year according to dusk. During the months of summer, the horses started their main time resting from 20 : 00 to 21 : 00; in the months of winter from 17 : 00 to 18 : 00. Especially lower-ranking horses were engaged in longer periods of resting in the daytime over the year. Recumbent rest was mainly observed in the time between right before midnight and sunrise. During daylight the horses rested 6 to 12 times for 13 to 22 minutes each time. At night they rested 7 to 11 times with a mean duration of 23 - 36 minutes for each resting period. The horses did not rest in a lying position every day, but if so, they spent 14 to 34 minutes in this particular position. At night the horses were engaged in recumbent rest 1 to 2 times, 15 to 33 minutes on average. A comparison of day- and nighttime activities showed very clearly that the horses preferred day time for grazing by spending tendency more time on single grazing activities. Hay feeding, on the other hand, tendency more often occurred in the daytime, but was more extensive at night. Conspicuous differences in foraging could be observed when comparing day time and night time activities during different months. The day and night comparison, conducted each month, revealed conspicuous differences in grazing behaviour regarding frequency and duration of action. In hay feeding, however, only a few conspicuous differences could be observed between day and night regarding the frequency of action. This does not apply to the average duration of actions. There was no difference in preferences regarding the frequency of day and night time resting over the year. The horses showed a tendency towards longer resting periods at night. Conspicuous differences could be observed in resting behaviour when day and nighttime patterns of the different months were compared. No remarkable differences in the frequency of resting during each single comparison of day- and nighttime patterns per month were observed. Though, there were conspicuous differences in the average duration of resting periods between day and night time per month. Grooming and locomotor activities mainly occurred during daytime. A comparison of day- and nighttime differences regarding the average duration of each action of behaviour with the day- and nighttime differences of the total time budget exhibited similar and contrary tendencies at the same time. Two grazing areas, regular hay spots and additional hay supply influenced the spatial use of the pasture for foraging. The horses preferred to stay close to the hay spots and on the grazing areas when resting. The two grazing areas were also used by the horses for rolling. The shelter and the trees on the pasture were used for self-grooming. Under the impact of external stressors like extreme climatic conditions as storm, high temperature and strong wind in cold weather as well as changes in hay quantity behavioural changes in comparison to seasonal behavioural patterns were described. When foraging, especially grazing, and resting, the horses seemed to be more influenced by the quantity of available hay than by rain or storm. Some horses, especially the highest-ranking mares, partly took advantage of light breezes on the grazing ground in case of high temperatures during foraging. Despite high temperatures, some horses, like lowest-ranking mares and the stallion, more fed on hay. This fact emphasizes <b>behavioural</b> <b>dependency</b> on social rank. Independently of their social rank and available food, all horses rested longer on days with high temperature. During the time of the year with low vegetation, low temperatures and strong winds, the horses were trying to increase their foraging independently of hay supply. The horses were engaged in longer grazing actions when being protected from the wind by the trees. For the horses, protecting themselves from wind was obviously more important than the protection from rain. However, when resting, the horses preferred their shelter. When horses are kept under natural conditions, species-specific needs like steady and peaceful movement, life in a group, interaction with the environment, and appropriate feeding are taken into consideration. Short-term interferences with the well-being of the horses in single cases and situations take place either because of inappropriate management measures, which can be influenced and changed, or because of climatic stress situations, which can only be influenced to a small extent...|$|E

In a first experiment, we trained a monkey for only a restricted set of orientations and then recorded from the temporal cortical visual area (TE) while he made discriminations at trained and untrained orientations. Although this orientation-selective practice induced a marked anisotropy in his behavioural performance, this was not matched by a similar anisotropy in single-cell response properties. In a second experiment, we compared the response properties of TE cells in two monkeys before and after practice in the discrimination of small orientation differences. The training had no effect on either the responsiveness or the orientation tuning. We did, however, observe alterations in the pattern of response modulations induced by the behavioural context.

40|$|BACKGROUND - In {{the early}} 1900 s, the {{industrialization}} of cigarette production rapidly {{created the first}} major expansion in tobacco consumption in modern times. AIMS - This article focuses on the “tobacco problem” as it was understood, debated and sought governed in Norway {{around the time of}} the First World War. I identify various attempts to define tobacco as a problem, including arguments put forward by the anti-tobacco movement, the medical profession and politicians. How were health, moral-aesthetic and economic conditions articulated and integrated in these arguments? What (if any) addictive elements of smoking were in focus? I also discuss the association between perceptions of the tobacco problem and political attempts to regulate it. There were repeated calls for a state tobacco monopoly to be introduced and municipal licensing system for the sale of cigarettes. DATA - The data are sourced from the journals Tobakskampen (The Tobacco Fight), the journal of the norwegian medical association and parliamentary documents. FINDINGS - The findings suggest that a) to the extent tobacco was perceived as a social problem, it was a moral one (vice), not a <b>behavioural</b> and <b>dependency</b> problem, which alcohol was perceived to be at the time; b) proposals to establish a tobacco monopoly were based on economic arguments only, and lacked any firm connection to social issues, health and morality; and c) the anti-tobacco movement was socially marginal and their commitment to the municipal licensing idea resulted in large regional variations in public support, too large in fact for the idea to be effective. Although the government did not introduce regulations in the 1920 s, the industrialization of cigarettes and subsequent developments in advertising caused a “moral panic” among tobacco opponents and created the modern climate of opinion regarding tobacco...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{institutional}} environment is acknowledged to influence the implementation of regional adaptations of forest management to climate change, there are few empirical studies addressing the institutional factors and opportunities of adaptation. Using Ostrom’s institutional analysis and development framework, we aimed to identify : (1) the critical and distinctive characteristics of the forest resource and institutional context that may determine how climate change-adaptive forest management measures are implemented and (2) the opportunities for implementing the planned adaptation measures. The analysis is performed on ten European case study regions which differed in many resource-dependent factors, policy arena factors and incentives for changes. The main factors influencing the adaptation are the ownership pattern, the level of policy formation and the nature of forest goods and services. Opportunities for adaptation are driven by the openness of the forest management planning processes to the stakeholders participation, the degree to which business as usual management is projected to be non-satisfactory in the future, and by the number and nature of obstacles to adaptation. Promoting local self-governance mechanisms and the participation of the external stakeholders in forest management planning or in the regional forest or climate change policy adaptation may be a way of overcoming path <b>dependency,</b> <b>behavioural</b> obstacles and potential policy failures in implementing adaptation. The study argues that both climate change belief systems and political participation are important to explain adaptation to climate change when multiple decision-making levels are at stake...|$|R

The presented study examines {{the question whether}} the dependent use of the Internet {{can be understood as}} an impulse control disorder, an addiction or as a symptom of other psychiatric conditions. Methods: Internet dependent patients seeking for psychiatric assistance and fulfilling the criteria for pathological Internet use (PIU) were examined with the Structured Clinical Interview according to DSM-IV (SCID), and a variety of questionnaires including the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Dissociative Experience Scale (DES). The patient group was compared to a matched group of healthy controls. Results: The adult patient-group consisted of 25 subjects, 76 % male, {{with a mean age of}} 29. 36 years. Average time spent in Cyberspace was 6. 47 h/d, mostly in online-role-playing games. According to SCID I and BDI, 19 patients (76 %) suffered from a depressive syndrome, with 10 cases of major depressive disorder (40 %) and 8 cases of adjustment disorder with depression (32 %). Six patients (24 %) suffered from a comorbid anxiety disorder. Compared to controls, the patient group presented significantly higher levels of depression (BDI), impulsivity (BIS) and dissociation (DES). Conclusions: PIU shares common psychopathological features and comorbidities with substance related disorders.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} programme detailed in {{this paper is to}} update the attachment control system framework that John Bowlby set out in his formulation of Attachment Theory. It does this by reconceptualising it as a cognitive architecture that can operate within multi-agent simulations. This is relevant to computational psychiatry because attachment phenomena are broad in scope and range from healthy everyday interactions to psychopathology. The process of attachment modelling involves three stages and this paper makes contributions in each of these stages. Firstly, a survey of attachment research is presented which focuses on two important attachment behavioural measures: the Strange Situation Procedure and the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). These studies are reviewed to draw out key <b>behavioural</b> patterns and <b>dependencies.</b> Secondly, the empirical observations that are to be explained in this research programme are abstracted into scenarios which capture key behavioural elements. The value of behavioural scenarios is that they can guide the simulation design process and help evaluate simulations which are produced. Thirdly, whilst the implementation of these scenarios is still a work in progress, several designs are described that have been created and implemented as simulations. These include normative and non-pathological infant behaviour patterns observed across the first year of life in naturalistic observations and ‘Strange Situation’ studies. Future work is described which includes simulating dysfunctional infant behaviour patterns and a range of adult attachment behaviour patterns observed in the Adult Attachment Interview. In conclusion, this modelling approach is distinguished from other approaches in computational psychiatry because of the psychologically high level at which it models phenomena of interest...|$|R

We aimed {{to determine whether}} donepezil produces worthwhile {{improvements in}} disability, <b>dependency,</b> <b>behavioural</b> and psychological symptoms, carers' psychological wellbeing, or delay in institutionalisation. If so, which patients benefit, from what dose, and for how long? Methods 565 community-resident patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease entered a 12 -week run-in period {{in which they were}} randomly allocated donepezil (5 mg/day) or placebo. 486 who completed this period were rerandomised to either donepezil (5 or 10 mg/day) or placebo, with double-blind treatment continuing as long as judged appropriate. Primary endpoints were entry to institutional care and progression of disability, defined by loss of either two of four basic, or six of 11 instrumental, activities on the Bristol activities of daily living scale (BADLS). Outcome assessments were sought for all patients and analysed by logrank and multilevel models. Findings Cognition averaged 0 · 8 MMSE (mini-mental state examination) points better (95 % Cl 0 · 5 – 1 · 2; p< 0 · 0001) and functionality 1 · 0 BADLS points better (0 · 5 – 1 · 6; p< 0 · 0001) with donepezil over the first 2 years. No significant benefits were seen with donepezil compared with placebo in institutionalisation (42 % vs 44 % at 3 years; p= 0 · 4) or progression of disability (58 % vs 59 % at 3 years; p= 0 · 4). The relative risk of entering institutional care in the donepezil group compared with placebo was 0 · 97 (95 % Cl 0 · 72 – 1 · 30; p= 0 · 8); the relative risk of progression of disability or entering institutional care was 0 · 96 (95 % Cl 0 · 74 – 1 · 24; p= 0 · 7). Similarly, no significant differences were seen between donepezil and placebo in behavioural and psychological symptoms, carer psychopathology, formal care costs, unpaid caregiver time, adverse events or deaths, or between 5 mg and 10 mg donepezil. Interpretation Donepezil is not cost effective, with benefits below minimally relevant thresholds. More effective treatments than Cholinesterase inhibitors are needed for Alzheimer's disease...|$|R
