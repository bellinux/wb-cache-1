Keeping this in view, {{this study was}} {{contemplated}} to find the comparative overview <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> in India and Saudi Arabia {{to know how the}} racial and cultural factors influence the pattern <b>of</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Material and Methods: A systematic web based search was conducted and original studies on poisoning published in India and Saudi Arabia were analyzed with respect to age, gender, category <b>of</b> <b>poison,</b> and overall distribution of toxic agents. Results: The study concluded that the male to female ratio in India was 1. 53 : 1 while in Saudi Arabia it was 1. 2 : 1. In India, the highest frequency <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> occurred with agrichemicals while in Saudi Arabia it was mainly due to pharmaceutical drugs. In India the most common mode <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> is intentional (70. 6 %) and it is commoner in the age group 21 - 30 years (31. 1 %). This is in contrast with Saudi Arabia, which showed that most of the cases <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> is accidental (54. 1 %) and occurred in children < 10 years. Conclusion: The study suggested various similarities and variations in the pattern <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> in the two countries with regards to distribution <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> among female and young adult victims based on contextual factors like circumstances <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> and differential access to the toxic agents.
