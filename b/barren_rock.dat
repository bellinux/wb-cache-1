It was {{operated}} by a succession of different owners, driving five levels through mostly <b>barren</b> <b>rock</b> to explore three mineral veins. It finally closed in 1880 when Manchester Corporation acquired the land for the Thirlmere reservoir. Only a few hundred tons of galena {{came out of the}} mine; probably insufficient to cover its costs.|$|E
500|$|Bottomlands may be salt-covered flats. Eolian {{processes}} are major factors in shaping desert landscapes. Polar deserts (also seen as [...] "cold deserts") have similar features, except the main form of precipitation is snow rather than rain. Antarctica is the world's largest cold desert (composed of about 98% thick {{continental ice sheet}} and 2% <b>barren</b> <b>rock).</b> Some of the <b>barren</b> <b>rock</b> {{is to be found}} in the so-called Dry Valleys of Antarctica that almost never get snow, which can have ice-encrusted saline lakes that suggest evaporation far greater than the rare snowfall due to the strong katabatic winds that even evaporate ice.|$|E

The largest glacier is Austfonna (...) on Nordaustlandet, {{followed}} by Olav V Land and Vestfonna. During summer, {{it is possible}} to ski from Sørkapp in the south to the north of Spitsbergen, with only a short distance not being covered by snow or glacier. Kvitøya is 99.3% covered by glacier.|$|E

500|$|In the 1980s, the U.S. Geological Survey began a more {{systematic}} {{study of the}} remaining glaciers, which has continued to the present day. By 2010, 37 glaciers remained, but only 25 of these {{were considered to be}} [...] "active glaciers" [...] of at least [...] in area. The National Park Service warns that if the current warming trend continues, the park's remaining glaciers will be gone by 2030. This glacier retreat follows a worldwide pattern that has accelerated even more since 1980. Without a major climatic change in which cooler and moister weather returns and persists, the mass balance, which is the accumulation rate versus the ablation (melting) rate of glaciers, will continue to be negative and the glaciers have been projected to eventually disappear, leaving behind only <b>barren</b> <b>rock.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to the game's back story, the [...] "Source" [...] of {{all life}} {{deep inside the}} planet created the first forms of life, who called {{themselves}} the Xan. They began as a small, perfect, immortal civilization, living in peace and harmony. The Xans' eventual discovery and research of the Source's power lead them to create powerful technology. They built a great civilization, but this made them greedy and arrogant. Two factions formed within the Xan, calling themselves the Redeemed and the Unredeemed. These groups fought over how best to use the Source — now strained and unstable from their tampering. They {{tried in vain to}} fix the problem, but discovered it was too late - the Source would soon destroy the planet. Rubi-Ka was ripped apart in a cataclysm, leaving it a <b>barren</b> <b>rock.</b> The Source, and small fragments of the Xans' dead civilization, were thrown into another dimension known as the Shadowlands. The survivors left in search of other habitable planets, where they planted versions of their species; they hoped that one would prosper and eventually return to Rubi-Ka. Earth was one of their destinations.|$|E
500|$|Shoshone National Forest is an {{integral}} part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which has 1,700 documented species of plants. Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from , which is more than , the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems. Lower elevations often have sagebrush and grass-dominated vegetation types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include lodgepole pine, which along with Rocky Mountain juniper, and quaking aspen are found at elevations up to [...] At higher elevations subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, whitebark pine and limber pine, are common, each occurring up to timberline. The region above timberline makes up 25percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13percent is listed as just either <b>barren,</b> <b>rock</b> or ice. The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation riparian corridors, cottonwoods and willows are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are endemic to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the whitlow grass, fremont bladderpod, shoshonea, and the north fork Easter daisy provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer.|$|E

There are 23 named lakes, innumerable unnamed ponds and tarns, cinder cones and volcanic buttes within the wilderness.
