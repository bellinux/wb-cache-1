40|$|Abstract: With the {{enormous}} energy demand and environmental concern {{the interest on}} the alternate fuels to the diesel engines has been increased. Among all the fuels alcohols have received a considerable attention because these are bio-based, renewable and are oxygenated. But due to its properties they require higher operating temperatures in the combustion chambers. Hence in the present work a ceramic coated insulated engine is developed by incorporating an air gap between piston skirt and crown {{for the study of}} alcohols performance and emission characteristics. The combustion efficiency depends on the mixture strength, piston material and turbulence in the chamber. So, in this work an attempt is made with brass piston and <b>brass</b> <b>insert</b> with nine and twelve grooves. Among all the pistons tested the <b>brass</b> <b>insert</b> with nine grooves is best in terms of engine performance and emissions.

40|$|The world’s rapidly {{diminishing}} petroleum supplies, their raising {{costs and}} budding danger of environmental pollution {{have led to}} an intensive search for an alternative fuels or increasing {{the efficiency of the}} available diesel engines. It is a known fact that about 30 % of energy supplied to the diesel engine is lost through the coolant and 30 % is wasted through friction and exhaust and other losses, thus leaving only 40 % of energy utilization for the useful purposes. If this lost heat rejection is reduced, the thermal efficiency can be improved. With the insulation of the combustion chamber Walls with ceramics, the transfer of heat can be restricted and can be used further for heating the incoming fresh charge and the same thing can be observed with exhaust gases. This increases the combustion efficiency and reduces the emissions. Hence in the present work, a ceramic coated engine is developed by incorporating air gap between the piston skirt and crown, cylinder liner and jacket, ceramic coating on cylinder head and valves. Therefore, a solemn attempt is made in this research work to investigate the performance and emission characteristics of diesel engine with diesel as fuel.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{two models}} for optimizing and guiding the micro injection moulding process. The models are {{generated by the}} use of a mathematical procedure, an understanding of the process, and empirical data obtained from several sets of experiments. Micro injection moulding is a well-known process that is heavily used in the mass production of micro polymer parts. It is a very reliable process and apart from the initial investment required for manufacturing a mould, the process is very low cost. Furthermore, polymer developments have led to the process being suitable for the production of micro parts in equipment used in several industries such as medical, automotive, aerospace and sensing. Due to these important industrial applications, several quality criteria {{have been the subject of}} research in recent years. One of the main challenges in micro moulding is the modelling of the process in terms of polymer flow and accuracy. This is because current available models use PVT data (pressure, volume, temperature) that is used for modelling of conventional injection moulding. Furthermore, these models ignore several factors in micro moulding such as the high shear rates and 3 D flow of the polymer melt. Moreover, modelling of the mechanical properties of the micro parts based on mathematical systems used for macro parts leads to large errors. This study proposes a new method for modelling the effect of process parameters on the dimensional accuracy and UTS (Ultimate tensile strength) of micro walls. This results in reduction of risk and cost, and optimization of the process. The “accuracy model” relates the dimensional error to four process parameters (polymer melt and mould temperature, and injection velocity and pressure), polymer characteristics (density, specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity) and a characteristic of the machine (plunger diameter). The “mechanical model” relates the part’s UTS to the same parameters as in the accuracy model. In order to develop the “accuracy model” an understanding of the effect of process parameters on dimensional accuracy and the polymers needs to be obtained. Several sets of experiments were conducted to investigate and establish this effect. Two polymers, Polyoxymethylene (POM) and Polypropylene (PP), were used to conduct the study. The results showed that the polymer melt temperature had the highest effect, followed by injection pressure, injection velocity and mould temperature. Amongst these, injection velocity had an adverse effect on dimensional accuracy. Further analysis was done to investigate whether the effect was consistent for several sets of the parameters. Results of the experiments showed that while the effect was not linear, the trends obtained earlier were correct. The same procedure was applied to investigate the effect of process parameters on the UTS of the micro walls. Polymer melt temperature had the highest level of influence, followed by injection velocity, injection pressure and mould temperature. Increase in all parameters resulted in reduction of the UTS, except for the mould temperature. Next, the two models were developed through a method called dimensional analysis. Several dimensionless expressions were developed to form a general relationship between the parameters and the quality criteria. Then, the obtained results and data were used to find the constants and the specific form of the functions. The overall models were validated by a fresh set of selected experiments using an original <b>brass</b> <b>insert.</b> The achieved trends and models were validated experimentally, using a different mould insert with a micro channel with a different dimension. While the values for the dimensional error and UTS were different, the trends obtained before were correct for the new insert. The same trend was observed with the models. Again, predictions for PP parts had better agreement with experimental data compared to those of POM. In addition, the amount of error for the steel insert was higher, due to different thermal conductivity of the insert material and surface roughness of the micro channels...|$|E

30|$|Previously, we have {{developed}} 3 D nanomolding, a modified molding technique allowing for fabricating micro/nanostructures along the surface of any arbitrary microstructures in polymer substrates {{with the help of}} a thin intermediate polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) stamp introduced between the <b>brass</b> mold <b>insert</b> and polymer substrate for molding [25, 26]. The objectives of this paper are two-folds. The first objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of the 3 D nanomolding process for simple production of microfluidic devices with fluidic walls decorated with micro- and nanoscale patterns. The other objective is to systematically investigate the improvement of mixing as different numbers of the microchannel walls are decorated with microgratings. Such a systematic investigation has been difficult to achieve due to the lack of a simple and low cost fabrication method for sidewall patterns. Using the 3 D nanomolding process, continuous microscale ratchet gratings were patterned on the sidewalls and bottom of the microchannel to realize 3 D T-micromixer structures. By using a solvent-assisted bonding technique with a plain or micropatterned cover plate, enclosed T-micromixers with no side, one side, three sides and four sides patterned with microscale ratchet gratings were fabricated and 3 D flow patterns induced by the surface structures at different locations of the microchannels were studied using confocal microscopy.|$|R

40|$|Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) is a {{relatively}} new plastic that is becoming widely used in many applications. In fact the production rate of LLDPE is vital in determining the process characteristics and subsequent properties of the end products. In this work we have examined, specifically, the influence of surfaces and structure on the rheology and processing properties of LLDPE. A review of the effect of surfaces on the rheology and processing of polymers is given, with particular emphasis on the interaction between metals and polymers. The influence of oxidative degradation and radiation on the structural modification of polymers is also reviewed. Standard rheological characterisation tests determined there was no effect of various metal and teflon surfaces on the rheology of LLDPE. There was also no evidence of wall slip on metal or teflon surfaces. The generalised Maxwell model (with Wagner 2 ̆ 7 s damping function) predicted dynamic and steady shear properties at standard characterisation rates well. The effects of degradation of LLDPE were quantified, and an increase in elasticity due to increased crosslinking of long polymer chains was noted during degradation tests. This effect increased with time (after a degradation time) and temperature. There was no effect of metals on the degradation properties of LLDPE, however, there was evidence of increased carbon-oxygen species (or increased oxidation) at the metal/LLDPE interface for metals containing copper at the interface (copper and brass). The migration of copper was facilitated by the low heat of formation of the oxides on the copper-containing metals. Increasing gamma and ion beam radiation dose decreased melting temperatures, heats of melting and crystallinity due to increased crosslinking at the crystallite surfaces and the reduction in crystal sizes. Gel fraction and tightness of gel increased with radiation dose due to increased crosslinking. Increased radiation dose also increased the elasticity and flow resistance of the samples as shown by rheological tests. The extension of a power law representation of the relaxation modulus of irradiated samples was extended to predict stress build-up and relaxation properties in steady shear tests. There was little effect of type of radiation (gamma or ion beam) on physical and rheological properties. However, there was a marked increase in the effects of irradiation in the melt (150 degC) on the physical and rheological properties of LLDPE, which was due to the increased effective amorphous nature of the sample in the melt. The equivalence of the effects of degradation and irradiation are discussed. Viscosity was well predicted by the generalised Maxwell model (with Wagner 2 ̆ 7 s damping function) at processing rates. The normal stress differences calculated by Boger and Denn 2 ̆ 7 s model correlated well with this generalised Maxwell model, which was due to the inclusion of a flow rearrangement term. There was a marked increase in exit pressures, exit losses, flow rearrangement length, flow singularity, and exit stresses for flow over <b>brass</b> <b>inserts</b> at the die exit. These effects coincided with the production of a porous, copper-rich brass surface and it was postulated that this was the results of surface dezincification which caused increased adhesion between the LLDPE and the brass via physical interlocking at the porous surface.

In underwater diving, lead is used as a ballast; in handicap horse racing each horse must carry a specified lead weight, based on factors including past performance, so as to equalize the chances of the various competitors. In golf, tungsten, <b>brass,</b> or copper <b>inserts</b> in fairway clubs and irons lower the centre of gravity of the club making it easier to get the ball into the air; and golf balls with tungsten cores are claimed to have better flight characteristics.

In track and field sport, steel balls used in the hammer throw and shot put events are filled with lead in order to attain the minimum weight required under international rules. Tungsten was used in hammer throw balls at least up to 1980; the minimum size of the ball was increased in 1981 to eliminate the need for what was, at that time, an expensive metal (triple the cost of other hammers) not generally available in all countries. Tungsten hammers were so dense that they penetrated too deeply into the turf.|$|R
40|$|Transition of {{hypersonic}} boundary layers can {{be caused}} by many different instabilities. The current research focuses on the growth and breakdown of second-mode waves. All experiments were performed in the Boeing/AFOSR Mach- 6 Quiet Tunnel at Purdue University. The low freestream noise environment at this facility is ideally suited for studying boundary-layer transition at conditions similar to those in flight. ^ A flared cone model was used to maximize the growth of second-mode waves at a constant frequency. The resulting disturbance amplitudes were large enough to cause transition of the boundary layer. Characteristic hot-cold-hot streaks of heat transfer were observed on a smooth wall model. Maximum second-mode pressure fluctuation magnitudes were measured to be approximately 25 % of the mean pressure {{on the surface of the}} model. ^ The effect of surface roughness was measured on the 4 -inch flared cone model and the Roughness Insert Cone model (with a 4. 5 -inch base). The first successful interaction of a roughness element with the second-mode instability was measured. Epoxy dots applied to the 4 -inch cone changed the pattern of heating when the roughness element height was approximately 25 % of the boundary-layer thickness at the point of application. Increasing the epoxy dot heights to nearly 40 % of the boundary-layer thickness further changed the heating pattern, but a change in the viscosity of the epoxy prohibited further testing. ^ The Rod Insertion Method roughness insert was then developed and successfully tested on the Roughness Insert Cone. Two RIM inserts were fabricated with 30 <b>brass</b> rods <b>inserted</b> around the circumference every 12 °. Each brass rod had a diameter that spanned 3 ° azimuthally. RIM Insert # 1 had roughnesses with a height of 380 microns while RIM Insert # 2 had elements with a height of 250 microns. Both inserts altered the smooth wall heat transfer pattern while still allowing large amplitude second-mode waves to amplify. The ratio of the roughness-element height to the boundary-layer thickness varied between 24 % and 46 % based on the unit Reynolds number. The elements never acted as a boundary-layer trip. Thus, the RIM roughness is a viable method for future studies of the nonlinear breakdown of large second-mode waves. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A simple direct {{injection}} method {{for analysis of}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or other organic components of particulate matter by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was developed. This method uses a small custom <b>brass</b> capsule to <b>insert</b> a particulate sample deposited on a quartz fiber filter or powdery sample directly into a GC injector inlet. This approach was applied {{in the analysis of}} PAHs in diesel emissions and other particulate samples, which are introduced into the GC and analyzed by MS using selected ion monitoring mode. Quantitation is based on the concentration of PAHs in a standard reference material (SRM), which are certified by US National Institute of Standard Technology to avoid matrix effects on extraction efficiency. A standard filter is prepared by deposition of small amount of SRM of diesel particulate or ambient PM on quartz fiber filter. By this method, the linearity for 12 kinds of PAHs (3 to 6 rings) was demonstrated from 0. 022 mg to 0. 65 mg of SRM 1650. The linearity of BaP, for example, was confirmed from 0. 028 to 0. 845 ng. The reproducibility of this method determined by analyzing the standard filter was 15. 4 %. By selecting an appropriate SRM as a standard material, this method is applicable for analyzing PAHs in fine particulate matter of less than 1 µm from various origins. Preliminary results for a series of ambient particulate matter, roadside PM, diesel soot and sidestream smoke, are presented. This method enables analysis of organic chemical substances, for example PAHs, in PM without any pretreatment using organic solvent, and without any expensive modification of GC instrument.

40|$|Historically {{valuable}} scales (dated 1560) from Cologne at the History Museum of the University of Tartu Tullio Ilomets, cand. chem., History Museum of the University of Tartu   The {{oldest of}} all the precision measurement instruments preserved at the History Museum of the University of Tartu is probably the complete set of coin scales manufactured in Cologne in 1560. It comprises the scales box (12. 5 x 22. 0 x 2. 7 cm), the scales and the weights: 28 tetragonous brass weights, two S-shaped copper-wire weights and one semi-circular copper weight. The scales were donated to the museum by the university’s Chair of Inorganic Chemistry in 1982. The chair staff believed that the scales had belonged to Ferdinand Giesele, Professor of Chemistry and Pharmaceutics (1781 - 1821, served at the university from 1814 - 1821). No other information about the original ownership of the scales or other aspects of their long existence is available. The inside of the scales box lid contains an inscription telling us that a master {{by the name of}} Thomas Wulmar Hussen made the scales on St. Johan Street in Cologne in 1560. This particular set is different from most coin scales manufactured in Cologne because of the way it is suspended on the <b>brass</b> rod <b>inserted</b> into the lid. Both scalepans are round and the whole front part of the scales is covered with a flowery metal ornament. Another notable difference {{lies in the fact that}} the 31 weights are of very small mass and are stored not in special recesses in the scales box but mostly in paper envelopes with explanatory inscriptions. The scales box in fact has two compartments with lids and two open drawers for weight storage. The main objective of this article is to describe the set in detail. The scales and scales box were thoroughly measured. The weights were weighed on Mettler B 6 analytical semi-micro scales. The author attempts to determine the weight system to which those of this particular set of scales belong. For the purpose of this analysis the mass value of the Cologne mark was set to 233. 8123 g. The calculations performed indicate the following: it is most likely that 15 of the weights belong to the Dutch troy-pound (as) system (weights 5 - 18 and 31); that two of the weights belong to the English troy-pound (grain) system (weights 25 and 26); that six of the weights belong to the ordinary carat weights system (weights 1, 2, 19, 20, 21, 24); that four of the weights belong to the Cologne mark’s penny (Richtpfennig) system (weights 3, 4, 29, 30); that three of the weights belong to the Nuremburg pound (Pfund) system (weights 22, 27, 28); and that one further weight (23) was denoted as a heller. The article contains a brief overview of the Cologne coin scales manufacturing process, the coin-making industry and the history of the Cologne mark. The author also examines issues associated with the process of determining the initial mass value of the Cologne mark based on old and new reference sources. This exhaustive description allows readers to draw the conclusion that this is a very rare reference-standard set of scales. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{worked on}} several {{projects}} this term. While most projects involved additive manufacturing, I was also involved with two design projects, two testing projects, and a fabrication project. The primary mentor for these was Richard Hagen. Secondary mentors were Hai Nguyen, Khadijah Shariff, and fabrication training from James Brown. Overall, my experience at JSC {{has been successful}} and what I have learned will continue to help me in my engineering education and profession long after I leave. My 3 D printing projects ranged from less than a 1 cubic centimeter to about 1 cubic foot and involved several printers using different printing technologies. It was exciting {{to become familiar with}} printing technologies such as industrial grade FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling), the relatively new SLA (Stereolithography), and PolyJet. My primary duty with the FDM printers was to model parts that came in from various sources to print effectively and efficiently. Using methods my mentor taught me and the Stratasys Insight software, I was able to minimize imperfections, hasten build time, improve strength for specific forces (tensile, shear, etc [...] .), and reduce likelihood of a print-failure. Also using FDM, I learned how to repair a part after it was printed. This is done by using a special kind of glue that chemically melts the two faces of plastic parts together to form a fused interface. My first goal with SLA technology was to bring the printer back to operational readiness. In becoming familiar with the Pegasus SLA printer, I researched the leveling, laser settings, and different vats to hold liquid material. With this research, I was successfully able to bring the Pegasus back online and have successfully printed multiple sample parts as well as functional parts. My experience with PolyJet technology has been focused on an understanding of the abilities/limits, costs, and the maintenance for daily use. Still upcoming will be experience with using a composite printer that uses FDM technology to print plastic while laying an internal filament of Kevlar or carbon-fiber inside the printed material. It has been incredible being exposed to this range of technologies and I feel very fortunate to be ready for virtually any kind of printing technology I come across in the future. Design work played a part in my internship this term as well. Working with Hai Nguyen, I was able to design a set of testing tips and a test frame for use with an Arcjet. The testing tips will be made of several different materials that will possibly be used in the heat shield of the Orion space craft. These designs included technical drawings that were presented to the fabrication shop. The frame design was created from 80 / 20 (a popular brand of frame construction equipment) and included an order form with pricing for fabrication. An independent design was also done for the virtual reality lab. This design was to create a hand-controller based on a previous design. This final design was sent directly to a 3 D printer without technical drawings. Overall, my design work has given me experience with using 80 / 20, helped improve my CAD (Computer Aided Design) proficiency, and increased my knowledge of how to set up technical drawings for fabrication. The final role I have played in this internship has been to assist with testing of the inflatable technology materials working Khadijah Shariff. I began the internship assisting with permeability testing with the initial plan to continue the testing independently after training. Unfortunately, the testing apparatus suffered a technical failure and had funding pulled which cancelled that portion of the project. Further testing with inflatable technology continued with tensile testing of various stitching methods. This testing took place over a two-days and concluded successfully. Final testing was to be more tensile testing but of straps used to connect various inflatable sections. Unfortunately, the needed grips for the tensile tests could not be located and put the testing on hold. It is possible this round of testing will still take place {{by the end of the}} internship if the grips can be found. Overall, this portion of the internship has helped me become familiar with one kind of permeability test as well as a popular tensile/compression testing machine. Finally, I also had the chance to be trained using a metal lathe for making very small tips for a soldering iron. These tips will be used to melt threaded <b>brass</b> <b>inserts</b> into 3 D printed plastic. Working with James Brown, I was able to successfully machine a brass rod down to as little as 0. 064 inches plus or minus 0. 001 inches. It was very rewarding to learn how to best use the machine and become familiar with a skill that will undoubtedly be used again in the future. I have been told by several professional engineers that learning to use a lathe and mill will be invaluable skills in the field. This knocks 50 percent of that goal off and I look forward to learning the mill at some point in the future. As is apparent with this list of projects, my internship was not focused on a single over-arching goal. Instead, I was able to gain experience in a myriad of very different areas. I feel like my time here was spent bouncing from one project to the next. Though sometimes difficult to switch gears, it was very rewarding to be a part of so much in so little time. My career and education will be positively impacted by what I have learned at JSC. My experience with 3 D printing has improved my ability to handle many issues that may come up in the future with multiple different technologies. The design work I took part in, especially creating technical drawings, will help me better present designs to any engineer or shop I will encounter. My testing experience has helped me become familiar with a popular kind of tensile test machine that will likely be similar to the kinds I will encounter in the future. Finally, my experience with fabrication has given me a rare opportunity, as an engineer, to take part in the fabrication of a part. This experience will help me better tailor my future designs for the manufacturing process and has given me an appreciation for detailed/delicate machining work. My experience at JSC has been successful and will continue to assist me for a long time within the engineering field...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} more {{automated}} process for drawing and twisting of graphene fibers than was currently in place. This was implemented by having two chemical baths with variable speed rollers at either end, and intermediate roller to spool fiber between stages, and a twisting cylinder with integral spool to twist the fiber as it is collected. The goal was to have this first iteration deliver a working prototype, however due to manufacturing delays and timing constraints, that will be missed. A second follow-on project would be able to continue the work presented here and fulfil the stated aims of the project. The bulk of the structure is fabricated from PVC pieces waterjet cut from a large sheet. This allowed for quick manufacture of most pieces in the design. From there, some secondary machining was done to add mounting and fastening locations. PVC pieces were attached to one another primarily through the use of # 8 - 32 screws with washers and a <b>brass</b> threaded <b>insert.</b> Due to PVC being a soft material, tapping threads into it directly was avoided. The baths were sealed mostly with an automotive gasket compound to permanently seal one half, while one wall was sealed with a silicon gasket laser cut from a sheet. This makes the bath wall removable for maintenance. Two baths were made to allow multiple stages of drawing or one coagulation stage immediately followed by a drawing stage. From the drawing, the fiber advances to the auxiliary roller. The range of speeds required to get desired properties at all stages did not permit the fiber to go from coagulation to drawing to twisting in one process, therefore following the drawing bath, it is wound on to the auxiliary roller. After the drawing process is finished, the fiber can be pulled from the auxiliary roller into the twisting mechanism, running at a lower speed so as to give the requisite number of turns per length of fiber to yield the optimal fiber twist angle. The twisting mechanism is a PVC cylinder supported on horizontal rods and driven by a motor mounted beneath the cylinder and connected via a plastic belt. The cylinder, motor, and support rods are encased in a box with one face open to allow the fiber into the cylinder. Inside the cylinder is a spinning rod mounted across the diameter that collects the fiber as it is twisted. The aim of the project called for a quick-release mechanism so that the rod can be removed quickly for storage of the fiber or other testing steps. All of the motion is powered by small 5 V DC motors that go through a 20 : 1 worm gear reduction. This increases the torque while decreasing the speed from roughly 10, 000 RPM to more useful ranges. The motors are powered through a NPN power transistor with the logic being controlled by an Arduino Nano that takes in an analog voltage and converts it to a PWM waveform to control the motor duty cycle. In total, the project came in under budget, using 84. 01 % of the $ 1500 allocated for the project. A third of this cost came from the need to expedite the waterjet cutting by going to a third-party outside of the campus community. Had on campus resources been successfully utilized, the total cost would have been closer to the $ 925. 38 estimate first presented...|$|R
