From 13 June, up until 17 June, it flew 3,899 sorties and dropped 3,086 tons of bombs. This average of 780 sorties per day was only a slight drop from the opening 11 days. Massed sorties were made on the city of Sevastopol itself. Bombing targeted hangars, port facilities, flak and artillery batteries, <b>barracks,</b> <b>supply</b> depots with high explosive bombs.

50|$|The Mullingar Town Band {{was founded}} in 1879 by Father Polland as a Holy Family Confraternity Band. The local Military <b>Barracks</b> <b>supplied</b> many of the early members who {{themselves}} were serving members of the British Regimental bands stationed in Mullingar.

5|$|The {{following}} year, in 1891, Rappe wrote {{a memorandum}} that explained {{in more detail}} the budget, which suddenly had risen to 4.5 million kronor, and would finance the construction of two strongholds at Paglaberget and Åberget {{with a total of}} six long cannon, ten howitzers and eight quick-firing cannon, all in armoured turrets, along with machine guns and bunkers, <b>barracks</b> and <b>supply</b> depots. The plan included a reserve battalion of 1,000 men, an artillery battalion of 600 men, an engineer company of 120 men, and supply and depot personnel. Axel Rappe's large study on the permanent fortifications of Swedena mandate given to him in 1882was published in 1892 and cemented the view that a central fortress was needed in Boden to support and supply troops gathering between the Lule River and the eastern border, alongside the strengthening of the coastal defences at Stockholm, Gothenburg and Karlskrona.|$|R
50|$|Beall {{was able}} {{to set up a}} {{hospital}} at Centenary College at Jackson Louisiana for invalided troops from Port Hudson and Clinton, but the space proved inadequate. Confederate bureaucracy had made it difficult for Garrison Provost Marshal John C. Miller to construct a logistical system of warehouses and transports to supply the garrison with food, medical <b>supplies,</b> <b>barracks,</b> bedding and other material necessary for their health. The use of earthworks for fortification, which required unending labor to maintain and were unhealthful to live in, also contributed to the poor health of the garrison.|$|R
50|$|Following recruit training, Massaro was {{assigned}} to the 1st Battalion 6th Marines as a rifleman, before transferring to Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. He remained there until March 1950. From Camp Pendleton, he {{was assigned}} to the Marine <b>Barracks,</b> U.S. Navy <b>Supply</b> Depot, Clearfield, Utah, as a security guard. That was followed by the first of three tours as a drill instructor at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego. He served on the drill field until April 1952, when he rejoined the 1st Marine Division in Korea. He was decorated for actions in combat during that tour.|$|R
5000|$|In March, 1847, the Marines were {{replaced}} by Company [...] "C" [...] of what was called Stevenson's New York Volunteers.

During World War I, the Regiment received battle streamers for the St. Mihiel Battle of Saint-Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne campaigns Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Deployed to France in July 1917, the 15th planned and constructed railroads, and helped build <b>barracks,</b> hospitals, and <b>supply</b> depots during the war.

5000|$|In 1764, {{desiring}} {{revenue from}} its North American colonies, Parliament passed the first law specifically aimed at raising colonial {{money for the}} Crown. The Sugar Act increased duties on non-British goods shipped to the colonies. The same year, the Currency Act prohibited American colonies from issuing their own currency. These angered many American colonists and began colonial opposition with protests. By {{the end of the}} year, many colonies were practicing non-importation, a refusal to use imported English goods. In 1765 the British Quartering Act, which required the colonies to provide <b>barracks</b> and <b>supplies</b> to British troops, further angered American colonists; and to raise more money for Britain, Parliament enacted the Stamp Act on the American colonies, to tax newspapers, almanacs, pamphlets, broadsides, legal documents, dice, and playing cards. American colonists responded to Parliament's acts with organized protest throughout the colonies. A network of secret organizations known as the Sons of Liberty was created to intimidate the stamp agents collecting the taxes, and before the Stamp Act could take effect, all the appointed stamp agents in the colonies had resigned. [...] The Massachusetts Assembly suggested a meeting of all colonies to work for the repeal of the Stamp Act, and all but four colonies were represented. The colonists also increased their non-importation efforts, and sought to increase in local production.|$|R
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War II {{the island}} was {{strongly}} garrisoned by both the Imperial Japanese Army (JA) and Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). A garrison of over 24,500 men reinforced by sixty tanks was garrisoned on Shumshu in nine locations centered around Kataoka. All coastal areas convenient for landings were covered with permanent emplacements and bunkers, interconnected with underground passages and trenches. All the warehouses, power station and hospitals were up to 50 meters underground. These defenses were manned by the IJA 91st Infantry Division, with the IJA 73rd Infantry Brigade. Miyoshino Airfield was a joint Japanese Army-Navy airfield, located {{near the center of}} the Shumshu island. This airfield based several aviation units operating including IJN Nakajima B5N2 (Allied reporting name [...] "Kate") and Mitsubishi G3M ("Nell") and IJA Nakajima Ki-44 ("Tojo") and Nakajima Ki-43 ("Oscar") aircraft. Kataoka Naval Base was under the IJN 5th Fleet and had three 60' oil storage tanks and other <b>barracks</b> and <b>supply</b> buildings. The base also had a seaplane facility on the harbor, as well as a 4000-foot and a 5000-foot land runways at neighboring Imaizaki Airfield. These facilities were subject to sporadic air raids from the United States Army Air Forces and United States Navy based in the Aleutian Islands from 1943 until the end of the war in August 1945.|$|R
5000|$|Named {{for former}} army general Adelbert Cronkhite, Fort Cronkhite was {{established}} in the late 1930s. With the rapid military buildup of the United States in the early 1940s, tens of thousands of temporary wooden structures had to be built by the army to house its growing ranks. The army's Quartermaster Corps and the Corps of Engineers were put in charge of the building projects around the country. Using standard plans, all types of buildings could be built in short time including <b>barracks,</b> mess halls, <b>supply</b> depots, chapels, and recreation buildings. Many of these types of [...] "temporary" [...] wooden building can still be found at Fort Cronkhite today over 70 years later. The first unit to move into the fort was Battery E of the 6th Coast Artillery in June 1941. The soldiers stationed at the fort manned local artillery emplacements as well as the three gun, 3 inch Antiaircraft Battery No. 1.|$|R
5000|$|Company B of the California Battalion, {{that had}} been left in Sonoma for the {{protection}} of the town, was soon placed under U.S. Navy command. [...] The American immigrants who comprised Company B eventually returned to their homes. Sonoma's Alcalde complained to the U.S. Navy about the lack of protection for the town and a detachment of U.S. Marines was assigned to the Sonoma Barracks. [...] In March, 1847, the Marines were replaced by Company [...] "C" [...] of what was called Stevenson's New York Volunteers.

50|$|A city's primary defence {{against an}} invading army {{is to have}} an army trained and {{stationed}} within its province. Creating an army requires both the construction of a barracks, and a fort to house the troops that are trained. Only six forts can be built in a city at any one time, with each one consisting of a single Roman legion of around sixteen soldiers, trained to be either auxiliaries with javelins, cavalry auxiliaries or Legionnaires; while auxiliaries can be trained without issue, <b>barracks</b> must be <b>supplied</b> with weapons (either sourced locally or imported) before they can train Legionnaire. Troops can be trained further with the optional construction of a military academy, which can make them more efficient and give Legionnaires an additional formation to use in battle. Cities can be defended further though the constructions of walls and towers, though as a general rule, gatehouses are required in order to allow the smooth passage of traders and citizens wishing to enter or leave the city. For towers to function they must have road access to labor and be supplied with sentries from a barrack, who not only patrol the wall and throw javelins at invading armies, but also man a strong ballista weapon on the tower that can be lethal to enemies.|$|R
