50|$|Another {{characteristic}} that suggests a slower gait in Aardonyx is the robustness of metatarsal I {{in comparison with}} those of other basal sauropodomorphs. This is evidence of a more medial, or entaxonic, position of the weight <b>bearing</b> <b>axis</b> of the foot, as opposed to a more mesaxonic position where the weight <b>bearing</b> <b>axis</b> runs through digit III. The development of entaxony in Aardonyx provides further evidence for its reduced cursorial ability and wider gauge-gait, which is thought to have preceded obligatory quadrupedalism in sauropodomorphs. Previously, it was thought that entaxony developed after the divergence of Vulcanodon due to the presence of mesaxony in the genus. However, the presence of mesaxony in Vulcanodon can be now considered an evolutionary reversal given the clear presence of entaxony in Aardonyx.|$|E

MethodLoad <b>bearing</b> <b>axis</b> deviation of the lower extremities was quantitatively measured by three examiners in 105 knees of 73 subjects who had osteoarthritis of the knee with a Kellgren–Lawrence grade of 1 or more. A line representing the load <b>bearing</b> <b>axis</b> was drawn from the center of the femoral head to the center of the ankle and the alignment of the leg was assessed by measuring the width of the proximal tibia and the perpendicular distance from the middle of the proximal tibial condyle to the load <b>bearing</b> <b>axis</b> (Fujifilm OP-A). A ratio of the values was calculated and expressed as a percentage. ResultsThe inter-observer mean difference was 2. 9 % (SD, 2. 7), and the intra-observer mean difference was 2. 1 % (SD, 2. 2). The mean intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for inter-observer trials was 0. 96; that for intra-observer trials was 0. 99.

The narrow jaws of A. celestae retain a pointed symphysis but appear to have lacked fleshy cheeks. Broad, U-shaped jaws were previously thought to have evolved prior to the loss of gape-restricting cheeks. However, the narrow jaws of A. celestae retain a pointed symphysis but appear to have lacked fleshy cheeks, demonstrating unappreciated homoplasy in the evolution of the sauropod bulk-browsing apparatus. The limbs of A. celestae indicate that it retained a habitual bipedal gait although incipient characters associated with the pronation of the manus and the adoption of a quadrupedal gait are evident through geometric morphometric analysis (using thin-plate splines) of the ulna and femur.

Significant varus deformity further aggravates the pathology due to medialisation of the weight bearing line osteotomy of the proximal tibia realigns this weight <b>bearing</b> <b>axis,</b> thereby relieving pressure on the damaged medial compartment. OWHTO is a promising option in this scenario because it is associated with high accuracy in correcting the deformity and less number of complications when compared to lateral closing wedge HTO or UKA.

5000|$|The {{expense of}} {{refrigeration}} {{led to the}} early dismissal of low-temperature superconductors for use in magnetic bearings. However, high-temperature superconductor (HTSC) bearings may be economical and could possibly extend the time energy could be stored economically. [...] Hybrid bearing systems {{are most likely to}} see use first. High-temperature superconductor bearings have historically had problems providing the lifting forces necessary for the larger designs, but can easily provide a stabilizing force. Therefore, in hybrid bearings, permanent magnets support the load and high-temperature superconductors are used to stabilize it. The reason superconductors can work well stabilizing the load is because they are perfect diamagnets. If the rotor tries to drift off center, a restoring force due to flux pinning restores it. This is known as the magnetic stiffness of the <b>bearing.</b> Rotational <b>axis</b> vibration can occur due to low stiffness and damping, which are inherent problems of superconducting magnets, preventing the use of completely superconducting magnetic bearings for flywheel applications.|$|R

40|$|Purpose : To survey an {{audience}} of international knee surgeons about their current opinions on the analysis of coronal knee alignment and their objectives for postoperative alignment in total knee arthroplasty. Methods : Survey of 300 surgeons from 32 different countries with {{an audience}} response system allowing three possible answers being either a positive or negative answer or an abstention. Results : Surveyed surgeons perform rarely preoperative and postoperative full leg radiographs and evaluate radiological outcomes more with short films. The main trend in this survey was towards neutral mechanical alignment, however yarns alignment is acceptable in constitutional yarns patients. This residual yarns should be obtained through a femoral yarns cut rather than a tibial yarns cut. The valgus knee can remain in slight valgus {{but most of the}} correction will be performed at the femoral level. The main objective of postoperative alignment in TKA is a joint line parallel to the floor and a central load-bearing axis through the middle of the arthroplasty.

Conclusions : Neutral mechanical axis with a joint line parallel to the floor and a centrally running load <b>bearing</b> <b>axis</b> remains the central scope of the surveyed surgeons.
