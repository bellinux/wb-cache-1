Upon trying to gaze upon her husband, who is standing in strong light, May is permanently blinded. The film concludes with May being content with her blindness and knowing that her baby is as beautiful.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians mummified many animal species, from {{cats and}} gazelles to crocodiles, baboons, and birds. Typically, many animal species were {{consumed}} as meat after death, {{but it is}} highly unlikely that dogs would have been eaten. Radiographs of exhumed dogs in the ancient world have revealed that the mummification process involved wrapping the embalmed bones together with <b>bandages</b> and placing them within a wooden statue of Anubis, the jackal-headed deity associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective as {{a result}} of a serious {{complication}} from compression <b>bandaging</b> in a patient with venous ulceration and deep-vein obstruction, a policy of incremental compression in such limbs has been developed. The purpose of this retrospective study is to review the outcome of this policy. Design limbs with deep-venous obstruction (stenosis or occlusion) were treated initially with 3 -layer compression <b>bandaging</b> and reviewed 24 h later. If 3 -layer <b>bandaging</b> was tolerated, it was re-applied for a further 48 h. If there were no problems, then 4 -layer <b>bandaging</b> was applied and the patient reviewed at 24 and 72 h. If 4 -layer <b>bandaging</b> could not be tolerated, the limb was returned to 3 -layer <b>bandaging.</b> Results of 325 limbs seen in a venous-ulcer clinic, 22 (7 %) had deep-vein obstruction. Fifteen (68 %) limbs were able to tolerate 4 -layer <b>bandaging,</b> five (23 %) could tolerate 3 -layer <b>bandaging</b> and two limbs (9 %) could only tolerate class 2 compression hosiery. The overall 1 -year healing rate was 55 %. There were no serious complications from <b>bandaging.</b> Conclusions a protocol of incremental compression <b>bandaging</b> is safe in ulcerated legs with deep-vein obstruction and produces healing in up to 55 % of cases...|$|R

5|$|Initially, {{coverage}} of the assault in Bernas was slow. The murder had occurred {{too late in the}} evening to be covered in the 14 August edition, and head editor Kusfandhi– due to press censorship– was uncomfortable with covering a politically charged case. However, other staff members convinced him to give greater coverage, and {{the front page of the}} 15 August edition showed Udin covered in <b>bandages</b> and gave detailed information about the case. On 16 August, Udin died without having regained consciousness; on the morning of his death, a breathing tube had been inserted.|$|E

5|$|Most {{traditional}} {{or historical}} first-aid treatments for redback spider bites are either useless or dangerous. These include making incisions and promoting bleeding, using ligatures, applying alkaline solutions, providing warmth, and sucking the venom out. In modern first aid, incising, sucking, applying <b>bandages</b> and tourniqueting are strongly discouraged. In 1893, the Camperdown Chronicle {{reported that a}} doctor noticed that a severely ill benumbed victim got much better overnight following treatment using injections of strychnine and cocaine; strychnine had been popular as a snake bite antidote, {{but it was not}} effective.

5|$|Celtic {{then found}} {{themselves}} {{embroiled in a}} series of controversial matches in the second round against Rapid Wien. Celtic lost the first leg 1–3 in Vienna, but despite rough-house tactics from the Austrians, it was only Celtic's Alan McInally who found himself red-carded. The return match at Parkhead was an even more bad-tempered affair as Celtic raced to a 3–0 lead with goals from Brian McClair, Murdo MacLeod and Tommy Burns, all in spite of Rapid's foul play. The match erupted near the end when Burns was punched by Reinhard Kienast. In the ensuing chaos, coins and at least one bottle were thrown onto the pitch by some Celtic fans. None appeared to hit anybody, but one of the Rapid Wien players, Rudi Weinhofer, was carried off the pitch with his head swathed in <b>bandages.</b> The match finished 3–0, with Celtic winning the tie 4–3 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Ibuki's build is {{depicted}} as slim and athletic, with black hair held tightly back in a topknot ponytail that drops well beneath her waist.

5|$|In November 2014, Adam is {{revealed}} to be recovering from multiple facial reconstruction surgeries, {{and is in the}} care of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan). When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had. Adam eventually recovers enough to have the <b>bandages</b> removed from his face; after the <b>bandages</b> are removed it {{is revealed}} that his face had been replaced by Gabriel Bingham; the man who died saving Adam's life, he returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows, but none of them recognize Adam or get the feeling that they know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant. Christine found out that the car is found at the south lake motel.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to investigate what happens when artefacts mediate interaction. To do this we investigated nurse’s interaction during the <b>bandaging</b> process in order to understand better how an artefact enhances user’s experiences. To maintain research rigour we applied a triangulation approach that links observations of current procedures, talk-aloud protocol during interaction and retrospective interviews. Using software to aid our analysis of the videos we produced diagrammatic maps of their interaction. The maps allowed us to see that some nurses <b>bandage</b> more intuitively than others. Nurses who <b>bandage</b> intuitively assemble long sequences of <b>bandaging</b> actions while nurses who <b>bandage</b> less intuitively “focus-shift ” in between <b>bandaging</b> actions. We argue that nurses who <b>bandage</b> intuitively demonstrate greater expertise than nurses who do not. We discuss these differences and explore how different levels of expertise can influence how mediated interaction takes place. Finally, we introduced how knowledge generated from {{this research}} can be transferred to the design domain, interaction and interface design in particular, and contribute to the design process as a whole...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Robert Jones <b>bandage</b> (RJ) is {{a widely}} used <b>bandage</b> among {{veterinary}} surgeons to maintain physiological position of the limbs. It is a 3 -layer composite <b>bandage,</b> which realization {{involves the use of}} several types of bands in a specific arrangement to give the <b>bandage</b> all its properties. Its proper making is difficult and requires experience, as the <b>bandage</b> needs to be not too tight or not too loose. This issue is a recurrent matter with every type of compression <b>bandage</b> (Rimaud et al. 2014). For the realization of a RJ, various types of bands can be used, depending on the surgeon but each layer has its own function that cannot be changed. The {{purpose of this study is}} to measure the pressure under a RJ <b>bandage</b> with a pressure mapping system and to evaluate the properties of some commonly used bands.
