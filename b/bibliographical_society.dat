40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes <b>bibliographical</b> references. Heteronormative <b>society</b> {{requires}} non-heterosexuals to "come out" to be recognized, {{and coming}} out {{is often the}} most challenging experience for sexual minorities. I will discuss how non-heterosexuals {{deal with the issue}} of coming out, and how sexual minority groups play a role in relation to individuals' coming out process in the Japanese context. I conducted interviews with 24 non-heterosexuals, including people who are involved with sexual minority activities and did participant observation at three sexual minority groups. Based on my respondents' experiences, I will propose the four stages of the coming out process that describes how non-heterosexuals in Japan deal with coming out, which is distinct from the Western model of the coming out process. The study also found that "imaginary social homophobia" influences people's decisions about coming out. At the same time, continuous activities by sexual minority groups contribute to increase the awareness of non-heterosexuality in Japan...|$|R
500|$|Reed was {{constantly}} busy; {{he held the}} [...] "loafer"—defined by him as [...] "anyone who worked from nine to five and did nothing {{with the rest of}} the day"—in contempt. Alongside his heavy schedule of duties at the foundry and his prolific writing, he took his share in the supervision of the various charities founded by his grandfather Andrew Reed, and was a deacon at his local Congregational Church. In 1892 he was a co-founder of the <b>Bibliographical</b> <b>Society</b> and its first honorary secretary, an office he modestly agreed to hold [...] "pro tem in the hopes of your finding a better man".|$|E
500|$|In 1881, {{following}} the death of his father, Reed became head of the company. By then he had begun his monumental [...] history which was published in 1887. Along with his B.O.P. contributions Reed wrote regular articles and book reviews for his cousin Edward Baines's newspaper, the Leeds Mercury. He was [...] a co-founder and first honorary secretary of the <b>Bibliographical</b> <b>Society,</b> [...] and [...] a trustee for his family's charities. All this activity may have undermined his health; after struggling with illness for most of 1893, Reed died in November that year, at the age of 41. Tributes honoured him both for his contribution to children's fiction and for his work as the definitive historian of English typefounding.|$|E
500|$|As an {{acknowledged}} {{expert in}} his field, Reed was in demand as a lecturer to learned societies. Among the papers he delivered were [...] "Old and New Fashions in Typography", to the Royal Society of Arts in 1890, and [...] "On the Use and Classification of a Typographical Library", to the Library Association in 1892. After Blades's death in 1890, Reed prepared his former mentor's unfinished Pentateuch of Printing for publication, adding a long memorial tribute to Blades. His foundry cast custom type {{such as the}} Golden Type for William Morris's Kelmscott Press in 1890 and Reed persuaded Morris to deliver a lecture on [...] "The Ideal Book" [...] for the <b>Bibliographical</b> <b>Society</b> in 1893.|$|E
500|$|Reed {{generally}} enjoyed vigorous good health. However, {{early in}} 1893 {{there were signs}} that his workload was taking its toll. In January of that year he left London for an extended stay in Ireland, hoping to recover his energies. He returned to his various duties in May, but later in the summer became seriously ill with what was identified {{at the time as}} [...] "consumption", and was probably pulmonary tuberculosis. He relinquished the secretaryship of the <b>Bibliographical</b> <b>Society</b> and returned to Ireland where, though largely confined indoors, he continued writing his regular weekly column for the Leeds Mercury and finished his final novel, Kilgorman. Letters to friends at home indicated that he remained in good spirits and was hopeful of recovery. However, his condition worsened, and he was advised to return home for urgent medical treatment. Back in London he wrote his last piece for the Mercury, a review of Seventy Years of Irish Life by W.R. Le Fanu. He died at his home in Highgate on 28 November 1893, aged 41, and was buried in Abney Park Cemetery, by the side of his father and grandfather.|$|E

2500|$|Osler was a {{prolific}} author {{and a great}} collector of books and other material relevant {{to the history of}} medicine.
