40|$|This {{workshop}} paper {{envisions a}} future of selforganizing UIs for ubiquitous computing. It proposes using self-organization to join many co-located interactive devices into an ad-hoc community of devices that serves users as a single usable and seamless UI. All devices of the community are aware of each other’s presence and contribute their individual input/output capabilities for the common goal of providing users with a seamless, usable, and accessible interface that spans across device boundaries. This is achieved by letting the UI’s behavior emerge from simple rules that react to changes in presence, location, distance, orientation, and movement of neighboring devices and users. By using simple rules of proxemic interactions between devices, deterministic preciseness of classic top-down design and modeling is traded in against less controllable, but more adaptable, robust, and scalable <b>bottom-up</b> <b>designs</b> that automatically react to the dynamics of ad-hoc real-world usage.

The BEATM design process proceeds from both ends in search of an optimum merging somewhere between the top-down requirements, and bottom-up efficient implementation. In this fashion, BEATM has been shown to genuinely offer the best of both methodologies.

We compare the baseline model and the bottom-up approach to research design. As the latter is less known than the former, we explain how it works and its advantages. We also show how Europeanization research can contribute to major questions at the core of comparative politics by taking a bottom-up perspective. However, we do not conclude that the choice is a dichotomy.

40|$|The {{business}} environment in transition countries is often extraordinarily challenging for companies. The transition process these countries {{find themselves in}} leads to constant changes in the institutional environment. Hence, institutional voids prevail. These institutional voids cause competitive disadvantages for small and medium enterprises. Cluster policy can address these competitive disadvantages. As cluster policy generally aims at supporting companies’ competitive advantage by spurring innovation and productivity, it can help to bridge institutional voids. This article’s research question aims at analyzing and comparing cluster policies in the institutional context of two transition countries (Serbia and Tunisia) and analyzes to what extent cluster policies in these two countries are adapted to institutional voids prevailing there. The case studies offer insights into apparent difficulties of clusters in bridging formal institutional voids, as well as, notably, into the informal void of skill mismatches in the labor market. Still, for some specific voids, clusters do at least implicitly assume a bridging role. While the cluster policies examined do not explicitly target the institutional voids identified, cluster management can—in the course of time—align its service offering more closely with these voids. <b>Bottom-up</b> <b>designed</b> cluster policies can play an especially important role in such an evolution towards bridging institutional voids...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Independent of the technology, it is {{generally}} expected that future nanoscale devices will be built from vast numbers of densely arranged devices that exhibit high failure rates. Other than that, there is little consensus on what type of technology and computing architecture holds most promises to go far beyond today’s top-down engineered silicon devices. Cellular automata (CA) have been proposed {{in the past as}} a possible class of architectures to the von Neumann computing architecture, which is not generally well suited for future massively parallel and fine-grained nanoscale electronics. While the top-down engineered semi-conducting technology favors regular and locally interconnected structures, future bottom-up selfassembled devices tend to have irregular structures because of the current lack of precise control over these processes. In this paper, we will assess random dynamical networks, namely Random Boolean Networks (RBNs) and Random Threshold Networks (RTNs), as alternative computing architectures and models for future information processing devices. We will illustrate that— from a theoretical perspective—they offer superior properties over classical CA-based architectures, such as inherent robustness as the system scales up, more efficient information processing capabilities, and manufacturing benefits for <b>bottom-up</b> <b>designed</b> devices, which motivates this investigation. We will present recent results on the dynamic behavior and robustness of such random dynamical networks while also including manufacturing issues in the assessment. I...|$|R
5000|$|This {{cellular}} automata paradigm {{gave rise}} to a third wave of social simulation emphasizing agent-based modeling. Like micro-simulations, these models emphasized <b>bottom-up</b> <b>designs</b> but adopted four key assumptions that diverged from microsimulation: autonomy, interdependency, simple rules, and adaptive behavior. Agent-based models are less concerned with predictive accuracy and instead emphasize theoretical development. In 1981, mathematician and political scientist Robert Axelrod and evolutionary biologist W.D. Hamilton published a major paper in Science titled [...] "The Evolution of Cooperation" [...] which used an agent-based modeling approach to demonstrate how social cooperation based upon reciprocity can be established and stabilized in a prisoner's dilemma game when agents followed simple rules of self-interest. Axelrod and Hamilton demonstrated that individual agents following a simple rule set of (1) cooperate on the first turn and (2) thereafter replicate the partner's previous action were able to develop [...] "norms" [...] of cooperation and sanctioning in the absence of canonical sociological constructs such as demographics, values, religion, and culture as preconditions or mediators of cooperation. Throughout the 1990s, scholars like William Sims Bainbridge, Kathleen Carley, Michael Macy, and John Skvoretz developed multi-agent-based models of generalized reciprocity, prejudice, social influence, and organizational information processing. In 1999, Nigel Gilbert published the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the social scientist and established its most relevant journal: the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation.|$|R
