5|$|Sex-positive feminist writer Susie Bright {{called the}} Magic Wand {{one of her}} two {{favorite}} vibrators, and called it a miracle that the device {{was able to bring}} about a orgasm in under sixty seconds. Bright wrote about her experience using the Magic Wand to relieve discomfort during childbirth. Author Kathy Shaidle wrote that the massager is able to give females multiple orgasms. Shaidle wrote that its effectiveness was not hampered by its appearance which <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> objects featured in the Mütter Museum. Sociologist, sexologist and sex-positive feminist Carol Queen critiqued the carbon footprint of the Magic Wand because it was imported from Japan, and praised its environmentally friendly qualities including its lack of batteries, and durability compared to other vibrators.|$|E
5|$|Other {{recurring}} characters appear {{only briefly}} in La Cousine Bette; previous appearances, however, give deep {{significance to the}} characters' presence. This {{is the case with}} Vautrin, the criminal mastermind who tutors young Eugene de Rastignac in Balzac's 1835 novel Le Père Goriot. When he resurfaces in La Cousine Bette, he has joined the police and introduces the Hulot family to his aunt, Mme. Nourrison, who offers a morally questionable remedy for their woes. Although Vautrin's presence in La Cousine Bette is brief, his earlier adventures in Le Père Goriot provide instant recognition and emotional texture. Elsewhere, Balzac presents an entire world of experience by including characters from a particular sphere of society. For example, several scenes feature artists like Jean-Jacques Bixiou, who first appeared in 1837's Les Employés and in many other books thereafter. The world of Parisian nightlife is quickly <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> with the inclusion of several characters from Les Comédiens sans le savoir (1846), and Bianchon appears– as always– when a doctor is needed.|$|E
25|$|Maria Nikolaievna was {{brave and}} inventive, {{appreciated}} novelty, and was almost {{indifferent to the}} opinion of high society. She was lively, energetic, talented and impulsive. In appearance and character she was like her father. She was Nicholas I’s favorite child {{and the one who}} resembled him most closely both in appearance and character. Like him she looked serious and severe. Her stare also <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> her father’s formidable gaze.|$|E
6000|$|I did not {{understand}} her, but, in some strange way, her words <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> my <b>mind</b> those that Natalie spoke at the last, and I answered: ...|$|R
60|$|There was a stillness {{about her}} then, {{a light on}} her face, which <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> my <b>mind</b> thought of Sally when I {{had asked her to}} marry me.|$|R
60|$|And so {{also now}} this chance {{word of the}} daily journal, about the Sirens, <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> my <b>mind</b> the divine passage in the Cratylus of Plato, about {{the place of the}} dead.|$|R
25|$|Among {{the topics}} {{explored}} {{by the new}} kantocu (singer or composer of kanto) perhaps the most frequent subjert of satire was the new role of women {{brought about by the}} formation of the Republic. Songs like Sarhoş Kızlar (Drunken Girls) or Şoför Kadınlar (Women Drivers) were sung seemingly in revenge for all the suffering they had endured at the hands of men in the past. Other topical songs include Daktilo (The Typewriter) which <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> the newly formed Secretaires 7 Society. Songs such as Bereli Kız (The Girl with the Beret) and Kadın Asker Olursa (If Women Were Soldiers) were full of mockery and ridicule.|$|E
25|$|EMDR {{begins by}} {{identifying}} troubling memories, cognitions and sensations {{a patient is}} struggling with. Then negative thoughts are found that the patient has associated with each memory. While both memory and thought are held in mind the patient follows a moving object with their eyes. After, a positive thought about the memory is discussed in an aim to replace the association the negative thought has to the memory with a more preferable thought. Experiments have shown that targeted negative memories are recalled less vividly and with less emotion after treatments with EMDR. Skin conductance responses, a measure of stress and arousal, have also shown lower levels when negative memories treated with EMDR were <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lawler's {{greatest}} coup came in 1984, {{when she}} was granted full access to the Connecticut home of twentieth-century collectors Burton and Emily Tremaine (as it turns out, {{just a few years}} before much of their collection was dispersed at Christie's in 1988). As sometimes happens in the history of photography, the artist serendipitously discovered in one place the crux of her entire project. Working in available light with a 35mm camera, she found treasures everywhere she looked, such as this decorator's duet between the tortured gestural slashes of a late Jackson Pollock and the filigree of a Limoges soup bowl. In Living Room Corner, Arranged by Mr. & Mrs. Burton Tremaine, New York City (1984), a Robert Delaunay hangs above a television and a Lichtenstein bust, which {{has been turned into a}} lamp, seems to stare up and outward. For a later piece, Fragment/Frame/Text (#163) (1984), Lawler photographed a museum wall label next to a landscape painting by Claude Lorrain; only a fragment of the landscape appears in the photo. In Foreground (1994), a gelatin silver print showing an open-plan living area in the Chicago apartment of art collector Stefan Edlis, Jeff Koons' Rabbit (1986) can be seen next to a refrigerator. By manipulating the focus and the view-finder of the camera, Lawler demonstrated how an artwork is determined by the paradigms of the art world: A label on the wall of an auction house would become the focus of an image, with only a small fraction of the work itself visible, and the idea of the artwork as a commercial entity would be <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
6000|$|To Joan, {{questions}} like these were profane frivolities and {{not worthy of}} serious notice; she answered indifferently. But the question <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> her <b>mind</b> another matter, and she turned upon Cauchon and said: ...|$|R
60|$|Something {{about that}} black {{immovable}} figure arrested his attention and fired his suspicions. Unaccountably almost it <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> his <b>mind</b> {{the thought of}} Ayoub-el-Sarnin and the bidding there had been for Rosamund in the sôk.|$|R
60|$|The Doctor {{looked even}} graver, and his eye fixed as on a thought far away, as the boy's grief <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> his <b>mind</b> the Great Assize, when {{all that is}} spoken in the ear shall indeed be proclaimed on the house-tops.|$|R

500|$|Rodriguez {{describes}} Starr's [...] "martial-sounding opening" [...] as a rare [...] "showcase {{for his own}} drumming", while Harrison biographer Simon Leng {{writes of}} [...] "a roaring series of Harrison slide breaks that <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> Duane Allman". Starr later said that he incorporated a hook he {{had come up with}} for the Beatles song [...] "Get Back" [...] into his drum part on [...] "Back Off Boogaloo". Further overdubs on the track included contributions from three backing vocalists, led by American soul singer Madeline Bell.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the greater}} {{independence}} that Roberts allotted her heroine, Dee is trapped within a patriarchal {{culture in which}} her uncle and prospective husband arrange her future. [...] The arranged marriage and ensuing events, including the misunderstanding and her running away, were common plot elements for romance novels at that time. [...] Dee's reactions, however, veered from the formulaic. [...] Her retorts <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> the [...] "quippy one-upmanship of feminist literature". [...] When a man attempts to rape her, Dee responds {{with a series of}} sharp comments, calling him, among other things, [...] "a filthy pig of a man", before succumbing to the traditional feminine response of fainting in horror.|$|E
60|$|Arrived there, {{they found}} that immense {{progress}} had been made with the new city--insomuch that Dromas assured Hafrydda that it <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> his <b>mind</b> some very ancient fables of great cities rising spontaneously from the ground {{to the sound of}} pipes played by the gods.|$|R
60|$|One of {{the present}} loose ends was <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> my <b>mind</b> by a {{conversation}} with Sylvia. I had been speaking of her cousin Marcia Raynor, and expressing my pleasure that {{she was about to}} enter a new life, to which she seemed so well adapted.|$|R
6000|$|The {{first moment}} of {{recollection}} <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> her <b>mind</b> the danger which had overpowered her senses; the next called to remembrance {{that of her}} father. She looked around; he {{was nowhere to be}} seen. [...] "My father, my father!" [...] was all that she could ejaculate.|$|R
500|$|Julius Robert Oppenheimer (April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967) was an American {{theoretical}} {{physicist and}} {{professor of physics at}} the University of California, Berkeley. Oppenheimer was the wartime head of the Los Alamos Laboratory and is among those who are credited with being the [...] "father of the atomic bomb" [...] for their role in the Manhattan Project, the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The first atomic bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945, in the Trinity test in New Mexico; Oppenheimer later remarked that it <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> words from the Bhagavad Gita: [...] "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the target}} {{audience}} of Burning Rangers was people who enjoyed action games, the developers also wanted to attract fans of other Sonic Team games. Ohshima stressed that he was aiming at a wider audience and {{not the type of}} person who only played Sonic the Hedgehog, adding that [...] "players should recognise the Sonic Team touch immediately" [...] with Burning Rangers. The working title was Firefighter, but it was dropped as the team wanted a [...] "cooler" [...] sounding name. Naka felt that [...] "burning" [...] had a [...] "go for it!" [...] connotation in Japanese, and fit with the disaster-rescue theme. He was initially unsure about having [...] "ranger" [...] in the title as he felt that a ranger referred to park rangers in western culture. The team thought that the image of a [...] "ranger" [...] also <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> the Power Rangers franchise, and after consulting speakers of other languages, Burning Rangers was chosen as the game's name.|$|E
2500|$|Palin {{later said}} that {{revisions}} of medical guidelines for cervical {{and breast cancer}} <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> [...] "rationed care", and she questioned [...] "what Washington has in mind with a government-controlled takeover of a health care system".|$|E
6000|$|She {{had sent}} her friends {{a list of the}} places at which she would be likely to stop. The message was from Jeff Saxton, in Brooklyn. It <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> her <b>mind</b> the steady shine of his glasses--the most {{expensive}} glasses, with the very best curved lenses--as it demanded: ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{mention of}} that range <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Bertha's <b>mind</b> {{a picture of}} her lovely kitchen, so light and bright and shining, and another spasm of {{homesickness}} and doubt seized her. [...] "Mart, we had no business to come away and leave that house and all our nice things in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{practice}} has <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> my <b>mind</b> very clearly {{the distinction between}} at least one form of automatism {{of the brain and}} volition; but the strength of the former is enormous, for the visual objects, when in full career of the change, are imperative in their refusal to be interfered with.|$|R
2500|$|A major river, the Tagus is <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> in {{the songs}} and stories of the Portuguese.

2500|$|The truth bias {{significantly}} impairs {{the ability}} of relational partners to detect deception. [...] In terms of deception, a truth bias reflects a tendency to judge more messages as truths than lies, independent of their actual veracity. [...] When judging message veracity, the truth bias contributes to an overestimate of {{the actual number of}} truths relative to the base rate of actual truths. [...] The truth bias is especially strong within close relationships. [...] People are highly inclined to trust the communications of others and are unlikely to question the relational partner unless faced with a major deviation of behavior that forces a reevaluation. [...] When attempting to detect deceit from a familiar person or relational partner, a large amount of information about the partner is <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind.</b> [...] This information essentially overwhelms the receiver's cognitive ability to detect and process any cues to deception. [...] It is somewhat easier to detect deception in strangers, when less information about that person is <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{actions of}} Slovenia's forces were largely {{dictated}} by the military strategy devised some months before and were tightly integrated with an equally detailed media management plan. An international media centre was established prior to the outbreak of conflict with Jelko Kacin designated to act as information minister and Slovenia's public face to the world. The Slovenian government and media successfully presented the conflict to Western European audiences as {{a case of a}} [...] "David versus Goliath" [...] struggle between an emerging democracy and an authoritarian communist state, and the columns of Yugoslav tanks <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> the events of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 two years earlier. This won considerable international sympathy and favourable media coverage for the cause of independent Slovenia.|$|E
6000|$|We seemed {{for a time}} to {{be confronted}} before an {{audience}} that hesitated to interfere. [...] "How dare you name my sister to me?"

2500|$|A {{substantial}} and precocious element of Negoiţescu's critical work was constituted by {{his focus on}} Mateiu Caragiale. Bogdan Creţu, who notes the enthusiastic reception Negoiţescu granted to Caragiale's poetic work in his very first published essay, believes there is an intrinsic {{connection between the two}} figures at the level of aestheticism. According to Ion Vianu, the [...] "beautiful, pale and distant" [...] Negoiţescu <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> Aubrey de Vere, the [...] "morbid aristocrat" [...] in Caragiale's novella Remember. Negoiţescu's lifelong appreciation of Caragiale's work, specifically his claim that Craii de Curtea-Veche novel was a masterpiece formed around a [...] "secret architecture", was contested by literary critic and Anglicist Mircea Mihăieş. Mihăieş described Craii... a sample of [...] "pretentious kitsch", and accused his various colleagues of having artificially increased Caragiale's cultural rating.|$|E

60|$|This {{unexpected}} demonstration {{from her}} prosaic sister touched Sylvia {{more than the}} most sentimental lamentations from another.

25|$|In Spain, Renaissance {{began to}} be grafted to Gothic forms in the last decades of the 15th century. The new style is called Plateresque, because of the {{extremely}} decorated façade, that <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the <b>mind</b> the decorative motifs of the intricately detailed work of silversmiths, the Plateros. Classical orders and candelabra motifs (a candelieri) combined freely into symmetrical wholes.|$|R
