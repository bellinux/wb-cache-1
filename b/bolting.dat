5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of lettuce}} {{over the centuries}} has resulted in several changes through selective breeding: delayed <b>bolting,</b> larger seeds, larger leaves and heads, better taste and texture, a lower latex content, and different leaf shapes and colors. Work in these areas continues through the present day. Scientific research into the genetic modification of lettuce is ongoing, with over 85 field trials taking place between 1992 and 2005 in the European Union and United States to test modifications allowing greater herbicide tolerance, greater resistance to insects and fungi and slower <b>bolting</b> patterns. However, genetically modified lettuce is not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} {{compares the}} shear behavior of fiber glass (FG) <b>bolt,</b> rock <b>bolt</b> (steel rebar <b>bolt)</b> and cable <b>bolt</b> for the <b>bolt</b> contribution to <b>bolted</b> concrete surface shear strength, and <b>bolt</b> failure mode. Two double shear apparatuses of different size {{were used for}} the study. The tensile strength, the shear strength and the deformation modulus of <b>bolt</b> control the shear behavior of a sheared <b>bolted</b> joint. Since the strength and deformation modulus of FG <b>bolt,</b> rock <b>bolt</b> and cable <b>bolt</b> obtained from uniaxial tensile tests are different, their shear behavior in reinforcing joints is accordingly different. Test results showed that the shear stiffness of FG <b>bolted</b> joints decreased gradually from the beginning to end, while the shear stiffness of joints reinforced by rock <b>bolt</b> and cable <b>bolt</b> decreased bi-linearly, which is clearly consistent with their tensile deformation modulus. The <b>bolted</b> joint shear stiffness was highly influenced by <b>bolt</b> pretension in the high stiffness stage for both rock <b>bolt</b> and cable <b>bolt,</b> but not in the low stiffness stage. The rock <b>bolt</b> contribution to joint shear strength standardised by the <b>bolt</b> tensile strength was the largest, followed by cable <b>bolts,</b> then FG <b>bolts.</b> Both the rock <b>bolts</b> and cable <b>bolts</b> tended to fail in tension, while FG <b>bolts</b> in shear due to their low shear strength and constant deformation modulus...|$|R

To resolve this problem, a second crossing of the Mersey is planned, to be known as the Mersey Gateway.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Borah joined many Idahoans, {{including}} Senator Fred Dubois, in <b>bolting</b> the Republican Party {{to support}} the presidential campaign of Democrat William Jennings Bryan — free silver, which Bryan advocated, was extremely popular in Idaho. Borah thus became a Silver Republican {{in opposition to the}} campaign of the Republican presidential candidate, former Ohio governor William McKinley. Borah ran for the House of Representatives that year, but knew that with the silver vote split between himself and a Democrat-Populist fusion candidate, he had little chance of winning, and concentrated on making speeches aimed at gaining a legislature that would re-elect Dubois — until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. Bryan, Dubois, and Borah were all defeated.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} with {{a speech at}} Bowling Green on August26, 1899. He answered many allegations {{that had been made}} about him, including claims that he had secretly been seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination all along, that he had ambitions of succeeding Senator William Joseph Deboe, and that following the nominating convention, he had agreed to speak on behalf of the Goebel ticket. Brown conceded that he desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and that he had agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination if it had been offered to him, but he denied that he had ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was <b>bolting</b> the party again, just as he had in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The <b>bolt</b> {{load loss}} {{behavior}} of AZ 91 D magnesium alloy <b>bolted</b> joints with a conventional SCM 435 steel <b>bolt</b> and an A 5056 aluminum <b>bolt</b> was investigated at elevated temperature. The A 5056 <b>bolt</b> {{could reduce the}} <b>bolt</b> load loss compared to the SCM 435 <b>bolt</b> due to smaller mismatch of thermal expansion between the <b>bolt</b> material and the plates. The mismatch of thermal expansion between <b>bolt</b> material and AZ 91 D plates was found to induce the compressive creep deformation in the AZ 91 D plates which performed as the main mechanism of <b>bolt</b> load loss. At higher tightening stress, the <b>bolt</b> load loss could be intensified by additional plastic deformation in <b>bolt</b> occurred during the test. Moreover, {{it is suggested that}} the plastic deformation could be reduced by decreasing the friction condition in the <b>bolted</b> joint...|$|R

30|$|In actual timber structures, {{members are}} often {{connected}} with multiple <b>bolts,</b> {{and the lead}} holes of the members are usually not smaller than the <b>bolt</b> diameter to facilitate assembly. The shear strength of multiple <b>bolted</b> joints has been investigated by numerous researchers [37]. In {{the case of a}} wood member subjected to a lateral force parallel to the grain with a single row of <b>bolts</b> in the loading direction, the maximum loads per <b>bolt</b> of <b>bolted</b> joints with steel side plates and an l/d ratio of 2.5 were almost the same when the number of <b>bolts</b> ranged from one to three [38]. When the l/d ratio was four, the ultimate load per <b>bolt</b> decreased when four or more <b>bolts</b> were used, whereas with an l/d ratio of 6 – 8, it decreased as the number of <b>bolts</b> increased from one to six [33]. With an l/d ratio of four, the load-carrying capacity per <b>bolt</b> of <b>bolted</b> joints with wood side members decreased when the number of <b>bolts</b> was three or more, and that with an l/d ratio of six decreased when the number of <b>bolts</b> was five or more [39]. The yield and ultimate loads per <b>bolt</b> of <b>bolted</b> joints with steel slotted-in plates and an l/d ratio of 6.3 decreased as the number of <b>bolts</b> increased from one to six, and the decreasing rate of the yield load per <b>bolt</b> with {{the increase in the number}} of <b>bolts</b> was almost equal to that of the ultimate load [40]. In the case of <b>bolted</b> joints subjected to a lateral force perpendicular to the grain with a single row of <b>bolts</b> perpendicular to the loading direction, the ultimate load per <b>bolt</b> of <b>bolted</b> joints with steel slotted-in plates and an l/d ratio of 6.9 decreased when the number of <b>bolts</b> was two or more [40]. On the whole, the shear strengths of multiple <b>bolted</b> joints were smaller than that of a single <b>bolted</b> joint multiplied by the number of <b>bolts.</b> However, the relations between the shear strengths of <b>bolted</b> joints and the number of <b>bolts</b> differed between reports. The different results might have been caused by the relations between the joint configurations, joint geometry, and characteristics of the wood species.|$|R
5|$|Once prey {{is brought}} down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and {{tugging at the}} carcass in all directions, and <b>bolting</b> down large chunks of it. The {{breeding}} pair typically monopolizes food {{in order to continue}} producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done {{at the expense of other}} family members, especially non-pups. The breeding pair typically eats first, though as it is they who usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat unmolested. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the heart, liver, lungs and stomach lining. The kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles. A single wolf can eat 15–19% of its body weight in a single feeding.|$|E

30|$|The {{characteristics}} of the <b>bolt</b> also affect the shear strength of a <b>bolted</b> joint. The load–slip {{characteristics of}} <b>bolted</b> joints using <b>bolts</b> with tensile strengths of 480, 530 and 640  MPa were experimentally investigated. When the ratios of the main member thickness to <b>bolt</b> diameter (l/d) were 8 and 12, the specimen with the higher <b>bolt</b> strength tended to exhibit the higher yield strength. However, the specimen with the higher <b>bolt</b> strength showed a smaller slip at the maximum load than that with the lower <b>bolt</b> strength, and the maximum loads of the <b>bolted</b> joints showed {{no relation to the}} <b>bolt</b> strength [19, 20].|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} experiments {{were conducted on}} a variety of <b>bolt</b> types to examine the load transfer capacities of different profiled <b>bolts</b> in short encapsulation push testing. A 70 mm section of 150 mm long <b>bolt</b> specimen was anchored in a 70 mm long stainless steel tube using full resin encapsulation. Six types of different profiled <b>bolts</b> and two non - profiled <b>bolts</b> were tested. <b>Bolts</b> with higher profile were in general found to have greater shearing resistance and higher stiffness than low profile <b>bolts.</b> Widely spaced profiles allow greater displacement at peak shear strength, and <b>bolts</b> with no profiles produced very little load transfer capability. Rough surfaced plain <b>bolts</b> showed a significant load transfer capability in comparison to a factory supplied smooth surface <b>bolt</b> which supports the belief that rusted <b>bolts</b> have higher load transfer capability that un-rusted <b>bolt</b> surfaces...|$|R

25|$|At this point, the <b>bolt</b> {{is locked}} into the barrel {{extension}} by locking lugs, so the expanding gas forces the <b>bolt</b> carrier backward a short distance. As the <b>bolt</b> carrier {{moves toward the}} butt of the gun, the <b>bolt</b> cam pin, riding in a slot on the <b>bolt</b> carrier, forces the <b>bolt</b> to rotate and thus unlocks it from the barrel extension. Once the <b>bolt</b> is fully unlocked it begins its rearward movement along with the <b>bolt</b> carrier. The <b>bolt's</b> rearward motion extracts the empty cartridge case from the chamber. As soon as the neck of the case clears the barrel extension, the <b>bolt's</b> spring-loaded ejector forces it out the ejection port {{in the side of the}} upper receiver.|$|R
50|$|The G3A3 (A4) is a selective-fire {{automatic}} weapon that employs a roller-delayed blowback operating system. The two-piece <b>bolt</b> assembly {{consists of a}} breech (<b>bolt</b> head) and <b>bolt</b> carrier. The <b>bolt</b> is held in battery by two sliding cylindrical rollers that engage locking recesses in the barrel extension. The breech is opened when both rollers are compressed inward against camming surfaces driven by the rearward pressure of the expanding gases upon the <b>bolt</b> head. As the rollers move inward, recoil energy is transferred to the locking piece and <b>bolt</b> carrier which begin to withdraw while the <b>bolt</b> head slowly moves rearward {{in relation to the}} <b>bolt</b> carrier. As the <b>bolt</b> carrier clears the rollers, pressure in the bore drops to a safe level, the <b>bolt</b> head is caught by the <b>bolt</b> carrier and moves to the rear as one unit, continuing the operating cycle. The <b>bolt</b> also features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the <b>bolt</b> from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface. The spring-powered claw extractor is also contained inside the <b>bolt</b> while the lever ejector is located inside the trigger housing (actuated by the recoiling <b>bolt).</b>|$|R

25|$|Classical mill {{designs were}} {{generally}} powered by water or air. In water-powered mills, a sluice gate opens a channel, starts the water flowing, and a water wheel turning. In 1787, American inventor Oliver Evans revolutionized this labor-intensive process by building the first fully automatic mill using bucket elevators, screw conveyors, and the hopper boy to spread, cool, and dry the meal between grinding and <b>bolting.</b> This {{was the first}} time that anyone had conceived and executed a system of continuous, fully automatic production.|$|E
25|$|In screen-printing a {{fine screen}} of <b>bolting</b> silk or similar {{material}} is stretched taut onto a frame {{similar to the}} way canvas is prepared before painting. A colloid sensitized with a dichromate is applied evenly to the taut screen. Once the dichromate mixture is dry, a full-size photographic negative is attached securely onto the surface of the screen, and the whole assembly exposed to strong light – typically about half an hour in bright sunlight – hardening the exposed colloid. When the negative is removed, the unexposed mixture on the screen can be washed off with warm water, leaving the hardened mixture intact, acting as a precise mask of the desired pattern, which can then be printed with the usual screen-printing process.|$|E
25|$|The {{process to}} build the SAS tower atop its {{foundation}} consisted of five phases. The first four phases each consisted of lifting four similar columns and <b>bolting</b> them into place and to elements connecting them, while the last phase was to lift the final top cap that will carry the crowning main cable saddle. On July 28, 2010, {{the first of four}} below-deck main tower pillars was erected, having arrived earlier in the month by barge from China. They were placed by lifting one end from a barge into a temporary scaffold, with a carriage on the barge to allow the lower end to move into place. After the columns were bolted into place, the scaffolding was then extended upward to allow the next set of above deck columns to be erected, lifted, and translated into position, a process repeated for each of the remaining phases.|$|E

25|$|The two SRBs were {{designated}} as flight set 122 by contractor Alliant Techsystems and were made up from one new segment and remaining segments reused across 54 earlier shuttle missions {{dating back to}} STS-1. Inside the VAB, engineers attached a large sling to Discovery and the orbiter was rotated vertical. The orbiter was lifted into the high bay where its external tank (ET-137) and boosters were waiting to be mated. During the mating operations, an internal nut pre-positioned inside the aft compartment of the orbiter slipped out of position and fell away inside the compartment. Engineers initially were worried that the orbiter {{would have to be}} removed from the ET and placed back in a horizontal orientation to make repairs. However, later they successfully accessed the area inside the aft compartment, and re-positioned the nut to complete the repairs. The <b>bolting</b> of the orbiter to its ET ('hard mate') was completed early in the morning of 11 September 2010 at 09:27 EDT.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 9, Rick Mastracchio and Clay Anderson {{completed}} {{the third and}} final spacewalk of the STS-131 mission.

During the installation of the old ATA in Discoverys payload bay, the spacewalkers had some problems securing a bolt on the ATA to the LMC. The spacewalk took 6 hours and 24 minutes, bringing the total EVA time to 20 hours and 19 minutes. While the EVA was going on, commander Alan Poindexter and mission specialist Naoko Yamazaki continued transferring items from the MPLM to the ISS.

50|$|CMMG {{introduced}} the Mk 45 Guard rifle incorporating a radial-delay in 2017. This system uses {{the rotation of}} the <b>bolt</b> head to accelerate the <b>bolt</b> carrier of an AR-15 pattern rifle. The <b>bolt</b> locking lugs are adapted to incorporate angles that rotate the <b>bolt</b> as it travels rearward under conventional blowback power. As the <b>bolt</b> rotates, it must accelerate the <b>bolt</b> carrier to the rear through an adapted cam-pin slot. This acceleration amplifies the effective mass of the <b>bolt</b> carrier, slowing the speed of the <b>bolt</b> head. This delay allows pressure to drop prior to extraction without the penalty of a heavier <b>bolt</b> carrier assembly. The system is similar to roller and lever-delayed blowback in that it uses the mass of the <b>bolt</b> carrier moving at a faster rate than the <b>bolt</b> head to delay the action from opening.|$|R
50|$|While {{it would}} be simpler and easier to shorten the <b>bolt</b> to fit {{completely}} behind the breech, the <b>bolt</b> must have {{a certain amount of}} mass in order to operate reliably with a given caliber.
