5|$|The <b>bat</b> {{species that}} occur in the {{archipelago}} of Puerto Rico are: greater bulldog <b>bat</b> (Noctilio leporinus), Antillean ghost-faced <b>bat</b> (Mormoops blainvillii), Parnell's mustached <b>bat</b> (Pteronotus parnellii), sooty mustached <b>bat</b> (Pteronotus quadridens), Jamaican fruit <b>bat</b> (Artibeus jamaicensis), Antillean fruit <b>bat</b> (Brachyphylla cavernarum), buffy flower <b>bat</b> (Erophylla sezekorni bombifrons), Leach's single leaf <b>bat</b> (Monophyllus redmani), red fruit <b>bat</b> (Stenoderma rufum), big brown <b>bat</b> (Eptesicus fuscus), eastern red <b>bat</b> (Lasiurus borealis), velvety free-tailed <b>bat</b> (Molossus molossus), and Mexican free-tailed <b>bat</b> (Tadarida brasiliensis).|$|E
5|$|<b>Bat</b> {{caregivers}} are {{not only}} specially trained in techniques to rescue and rehabilitate bats, {{but they are also}} vaccinated against rabies. Although the chance of contracting the rabies-like Australian <b>bat</b> lyssavirus is extremely small, <b>bat</b> caregivers are inoculated for their own protection.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{employ a}} number of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most species are polygynous, where males mate with multiple females. Male pipistrelle, noctule and vampire bats may claim and defend resources that attract females, such as roost sites, and mate with those females. Males that are unable to claim a site are forced {{to live on the}} periphery where they have less reproductive success. Promiscuity, where both sexes mate with multiple partners, exists in species like the Mexican free-tailed <b>bat</b> and the little brown <b>bat.</b> Nevertheless, there does appear to be bias towards certain males among females in these bats. In a few species, such as the yellow-winged <b>bat</b> and spectral <b>bat,</b> adult males and females form monogamous pairs. Lek mating, where males aggregate and compete for female choice though display, is rare in bats but notably occurs in the highly sexually dimorphic hammer-headed <b>bat</b> (Hypsignathus monstrosus).|$|E

50|$|The <b>bat's</b> form {{has become}} more refined over time. In the mid-1800s, {{baseball}} batters were known to shape or whittle their own <b>bats</b> by hand. This allowed {{there to be a}} wide variety in shape, size, and weight. For example, there were flat <b>bats,</b> round <b>bats,</b> short <b>bats,</b> and fat <b>bats.</b> Earlier <b>bats</b> were known to be much heavier and larger than today's regulated ones. During the 19th century, many shapes were experimented with, as well as handle designs. Today, <b>bats</b> are much more uniform in design.|$|R

The <b>bat</b> feeds during short activity periods in the evening and dawn, foraging around nearby forest areas for insects. Females give birth annually to a single offspring.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people put}} up <b>bat</b> houses to attract bats. The 1991 University of Florida <b>bat</b> {{house is the}} largest {{occupied}} artificial roost in the world, with around 300,000 residents. In Britain, thickwalled and partly underground World War II pillboxes have been converted to make roosts for bats, and purpose-built <b>bat</b> houses are occasionally built to mitigate damage to habitat from road or other developments.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) discovers a <b>bat</b> in the ceiling. It flies {{through the}} office, sending the {{employees}} scurrying for cover.

40|$|Tacaribe virus (TCRV) was {{isolated}} in the 1950 s from artibeus <b>bats</b> captured {{on the island of}} Trinidad. The initial characterization of TCRV suggested that artibeus <b>bats</b> were natural reservoir hosts. However, nearly 60 years later experimental infections of Jamaican fruit <b>bats</b> (Artibeus jamaicensis) resulted in fatal disease or clearance, suggesting artibeus <b>bats</b> may not be a reservoir host. To further evaluate the TCRV reservoir host status of artibeus <b>bats,</b> we captured <b>bats</b> of six species in Trinidad for evidence of infection. <b>Bats</b> of all four fruigivorous species captured had antibodies to TCRV nucleocapsid, whereas none of the insectivore or nectarivore species did. Many flat-faced fruit-eating <b>bats</b> (A. planirostris) and great fruit-eating <b>bats</b> (A. literatus) were seropositive by ELISA and western blot to TCRV nucleocapsid antigen, as were two of four Seba's fruit <b>bats</b> (Carollia perspicillata) and two of three yellow-shouldered fruit <b>bats</b> (Sturnira lilium). Serum neutralization tests failed to detect neutralizing antibodies to TCRV from these <b>bats.</b> TCRV RNA was not detected in lung tissues or lung homogenates inoculated onto Vero cells. These data indicate that TCRV or a similar arenavirus continues to circulate among fruit <b>bats</b> of Trinidad but {{there was no evidence of}} persistent infection, suggesting artibeus <b>bats</b> are not reservoir hosts...|$|R
5|$|Most microbats, {{especially}} in temperate areas, prey on insects. The diet of an insectivorous <b>bat</b> may span {{a wide range}} of species, including flies, beetles, moths, grasshoppers, crickets, termites, bees, wasps, mayflies and caddisflies. Large numbers of Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) fly hundreds of meters above the ground in central Texas to feed on migrating moths. Species that hunt insects in flight, like the little brown <b>bat</b> (Myotis lucifugus), may catch an insect in mid-air with its mouth, and eat it in the air or use their tail membranes or wings to scoop up the insect and carry it to the mouth. The <b>bat</b> may also take the insect back to its roost and eat it there. Slower moving <b>bat</b> species such as the brown long-eared <b>bat</b> (Plecotus auritus) and many horseshoe <b>bat</b> species, may take or glean insects from vegatation or hunt them from perches. Insectivorous bats living at high latitudes have to consume prey with higher energetic value than tropical bats.|$|E
5|$|Next was a Hardcore {{match between}} Randy Orton and Cactus Jack for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. One {{spot in the}} match saw Cactus lie a barbed wire {{baseball}} <b>bat</b> between Orton's legs and perform a leg drop. Cactus continued to use the <b>bat,</b> as he poured gasoline on it and tried to light it on fire. Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff interrupted and informed Cactus {{that he would be}} disqualified and the event would end if he lit the <b>bat</b> on fire. Orton executed an RKO on Cactus onto the barbed wire baseball <b>bat</b> to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October 2009, in a {{game against}} the Sacramento Kings, a <b>bat</b> descended onto the court at the AT Center, causing a {{stoppage}} of play.

On 9 April 2010, the Spurs and Ginóbili agreed to a three-year, $39 million contract extension through the 2012–13 season.|$|E
50|$|When {{baseball}} {{was in its}} beginning years, baseball players made their own <b>bats.</b> This allowed players to experiment with different shapes and sizes of the <b>bats.</b> It did not take long for players {{to realize that the}} best <b>bats</b> were those with rounded barrels. Wood <b>bats</b> are rare at most levels other than the pros. The majority of wood baseball <b>bats</b> today are made from northern white ash harvested from Pennsylvania or New York. White ash is used because of its hardness, durability, strength, weight and feel. Trees that provide the lumber for baseball <b>bats</b> are often 50 years old, and of all the lumber harvested, the top 10 percent is saved for pro <b>bats.</b> Recent technology in drying wood has created <b>bats</b> with lower moisture content, which are light enough to make effective baseball <b>bats.</b> Rock or Sugar Maple <b>bats</b> are preferred. Maple <b>bats</b> cost more than white ash, but they often last longer {{as a result of their}} high strength.|$|R

5|$|Some bats prey on vertebrates, such as fish, frogs, lizards, {{birds and}} mammals. The fringe-lipped <b>bat</b> (Trachops cirrhosus,) for example, is {{particularly}} skilled at catching frogs. These bats locate {{large groups of}} frogs by tracking their mating calls, then plucking them {{from the surface of}} the water with their sharp canine teeth. Another example is the greater noctule <b>bat,</b> which can catch birds in flight. Some species, like the greater bulldog <b>bat</b> (Noctilio leporinus) hunt fish. They use echolocation to detect small ripples on the water's surface, swoop down and use specially enlarged claws on their hind feet to grab the fish, then take their prey to a feeding roost and consume it. At least two species of <b>bat</b> are known to feed on other bats: the spectral <b>bat,</b> also known as the American false vampire <b>bat,</b> and the ghost <b>bat</b> of Australia.|$|E
