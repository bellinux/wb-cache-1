A 2016 analysis <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Consumer</b> Federation of America (CFA) found that 5 years after its introduction, sales of plug-in electric cars in the U.S. continued to outsell conventional hybrids. An analysis by Scientific American found a similar trend {{at the international level}} when considering the global top selling PEVs over a 36-month introductory period.

5|$|Efforts {{during the}} Ford and Carter administrations to force {{metrication}} were seized on by many newspaper editorialists as being dictatorial.

40|$|The study compares gross {{revenues}} from modern rice varieties and landraces and valuates different useful traits of rice landraces to demonstrate an empirical methodology for biodiversity valuation.

For estimating <b>the</b> value put <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumers</b> on different rice traits a hedonic pricing model was used that disaggregates <b>the</b> prices paid <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumers</b> for different useful traits of rice. The {{results show that}} <b>the</b> <b>consumers</b> value aromatic and tasty traits much higher than other traits. As the farmers are earning much lower income from many landraces as compared to that from modern varieties, the farmers are likely to replace them <b>by</b> <b>the</b> modern varieties. The findings of the study will be helpful to prepare market based strategies for rice biodiversity conservation, particularly {{for the conservation of}} rice landraces...|$|R
