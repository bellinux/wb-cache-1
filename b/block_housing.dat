5|$|After much discussion, Harrison, who {{coordinated the}} meetings, {{determined}} that a design based on Niemeyer's project 32 and Le Corbusier's project 23 would be developed for the final project. Le Corbusier's project 23 consisted of a large block containing both the Assembly Hall and the Council Chambers {{near the center of}} the site with the Secretariat tower emerging as a slab from the south. Niemeyer's plan was closer to that actually constructed, with a distinctive General Assembly building, a long low horizontal <b>block</b> <b>housing</b> the other meeting rooms, and a tall tower for the Secretariat. The complex as built, however, repositioned Niemeyer's General Assembly building to the north of this tripartite composition. This plan included a public plaza as well.|$|E

500|$|On 11 June 2010, Lima Superior Court Judge Juan Buendia ordered Van der Sloot held {{on charges}} of first-degree murder and robbery, {{determining}} that he acted with [...] "ferocity and great cruelty". Under Peruvian law, Van der Sloot was not eligible to be released on bail, and would be tried {{by a panel of}} three judges rather than a jury. A simple majority of the three was required for conviction. Police transported Van der Sloot on the same day from Lima's Palace of Justice in an armored truck, while angry onlookers yelled and threw rotten lettuce. He was taken to the Miguel Castro Castro maximum security prison and placed in a cell near the prison director's office for his own safety. He was registered as inmate #326390 and separated from the general prison population under 24-hour guard, in a high-security cell <b>block</b> <b>housing</b> only one other inmate. Van der Sloot reportedly offered to disclose the location of Holloway's body in exchange for transfer to an Aruban prison because of fear for his life. President PÃ©rez said that Van der Sloot would have to stand trial for the homicide before any extradition request would be considered. He also stated that Van der Sloot will serve his prison sentence in Peru. There is no treaty for the transfer of prisoners between Peru and the Netherlands.|$|E
2500|$|Rotary engines have {{a problem}} not found in {{reciprocating}} piston four-stroke engines in that the <b>block</b> <b>housing</b> has intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust occurring at fixed locations around the housing.

2500|$|After the Abu Ghraib {{prisoner}} abuse scandal, many detainees from Abu Ghraib {{were transferred}} to Camp Bucca. After a substantial turn-over {{in the chain of}} command at Camp Bucca and substantial amendments to camp policy, the US military held up Camp Bucca {{as an example of how}} a model detention facility should be run. A majority of the detainees were reportedly housed in cinder <b>block</b> <b>housing</b> units with wooden roofing rather than tents, while other detainees were held in hasty tent compounds until 2009.. Cigarettes, tea, and the opportunity to listen to radio and T.V. programs were used as incentives for good behavior. Some detainees were allowed family visitation from Iraqi relatives not held at the facility. [...] Detainees were provided the opportunity for basic education including reading, writing (both English and Arabic), arithmetic, basic geography and art. Detainees organized and administered their own classes in subjects like literacy and religion, and competed in soccer matches. Soccer matches were encouraged to attempt to promote cooperation and trust between every aspect involved in the camp.|$|E
2500|$|Problems arose during {{research}} in the 1950s and 1960s. For a while, engineers were faced with what they called [...] "chatter marks" [...] and [...] "devil's scratch" [...] in the inner epitrochoid surface. They discovered that the cause was the apex seals reaching a resonating vibration, and the problem was solved by reducing the thickness and weight of apex seals. Scratches disappeared after the introduction of more compatible materials for seals and housing coatings. Another early problem was the build-up of cracks in the stator surface near the plug hole, which was eliminated by installing the spark plugs in a separate metal insert/ copper sleeve in the housing, instead of plug being screwed directly into the <b>block</b> <b>housing.</b> Toyota found that substituting a glow-plug for the leading site spark plug improved low rpm, part load, specific fuel consumption by 7%, and also emissions and idle. A later alternative solution to spark plug boss cooling was provided with a variable coolant velocity scheme for water-cooled rotaries, which has had widespread use, being patented by Curtiss-Wright, with the last-listed for better air-cooled engine spark plug boss cooling. These approaches did not require a high-conductivity copper insert, but did not preclude its use. Ford tested a rotary engine with the plugs placed in the side plates, {{instead of the usual}} placement in the housing working surface ( [...] , 1978).|$|E
