40|$|This article {{discusses}} bone as {{a source}} of lead {{to the rest of the}} body and as a record of past lead exposure. Bone lead levels generally increase with age at rates dependent on the skeletal site and lead exposure. After occupational exposure, the slow decline in blood lead, a 5 - to 19 -year half-life, reflects the long skeletal half-life. Repeated measurements of bone lead demonstrate the slow elimination of lead from bone. Stable isotope ratios have revealed many details of skeletal uptake and subsequent release. The bulk turnover rates for compact bone are about 2 % per year and 8 % for spine. Turnover activity varies with age and health. Even though lead approximates calcium, radium, strontium, barium, fluorine, and other <b>bone</b> <b>seekers,</b> the rates for each are different. A simple, twopool (bone and blood) kinetic model is presented with proposed numerical values for the changes in blood lead levels that occur with changes in turnover rates. Two approaches are offered to further quantify lead turnover. One involves a study of subjects with known past exposure. Changes in the ratio of blood lead to bone lead with time would reflect the course of bone lead availability. Also, stable isotopes and subjects who move from one geographical area to another offer opportunities. Sequential isotope measurements would indicate how much of the lead in blood is from current exposure or bone stores, distinct from changes in absorption or excretion...|$|R
50|$|A <b>bone</b> <b>seeker</b> is an element, often a radioisotope, {{that tends}} to {{accumulate}} in the bones of humans and other animals when it is introduced into the body. An example is 90Sr, which behaves chemically like calcium and can replace the calcium in bones. Other bone seekers include radium, samarium, and plutonium.|$|E

Undoubtedly, the activity concentrations of NORMS in herbal formulations are quite {{lower than in}} the raw plants due to the preparation processes which inevitably {{remove some of the}} radionuclides. The health effects of radiation exposures to NORMS from intake of medicinal plants and herbal preparations in relation to the levels of NORMS in medicinal plants may be associated with most forms of leukemia and with cancer of many organs such as the bone, lung, breast and thyroid in the long term, but not with all organs including prostate.

30|$|Radioactive {{strontium}} can {{be replaced}} instead of calcium in biosphere known as a <b>bone</b> <b>seeker</b> and it can also transfer to human body through food chain {{in which it has}} long retention time. 90 Sr is taken up via gastrointestinal system and aggregate in the body turning to a part of the bone marrow tissue and hurting blood-producing cells [7]. Also, it can be a cause of leukemia or skeletal cancer. This is because of its chemical propinquity and alkaline earth metallic characteristics. For this reason, its characteristics and migration in the environment are widely studied. Drinking waters and fresh waters usually contain many natural radionuclides; Strontium, tritium, radon, radium and uranium isotopes, etc. In recent years, there has been an increase in the usage of zeolites in different compositions to remove and bury different radio-contaminations [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Zeolites are porous crystalline structurally— hydrated alumina silicates of group IA and IIA elements such as sodium, potassium, barium, magnesium and calcium. One of the most significant properties of zeolites is their ability to exchange cations. Clinoptilolite (Cp) is one of a very cheap, available and the most abundant natural zeolites is in the chemical class of family of Heulandite (HEU-type), easily obtained from mines, appropriate as a sorbent due to its natural characteristics [13, 14].|$|E
30|$|Prostate cancer (PCa) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} diagnosed cancer in men, and the second most lethal cancer among North American men [1]. Localized PCa is treated with surgery and/or radiation therapy. For those patients who have advanced androgen sensitive disease, the standard treatment is usually different forms of androgen deprivation therapy [2]. If the disease progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), a state {{of resistance to the}} therapeutic regiment of serum androgen suppression, the prognosis becomes poor, with an expected survival for patients with metastases of less than 19  months [3]. Resistance to androgen suppression is complex and relies on, e.g., changes in androgen receptor (AR) sensitivity, AR specificity, AR ligand independence, or bypassing of the AR pathway [4]. Commonly, CRPC is treated with the continuation of androgen deprivation, chemotherapy, and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). However, there are also several new approaches with promising results for combating CRPC, ranging from anti-androgen synthesis therapy to immunotherapy [5]. Radionuclide therapy with the α-emitting <b>bone</b> <b>seeker</b> 223 Ra (Xofigo, Bayer) has shown encouraging results with an increase of median overall survival of 3.6  months [6]. Also, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has been extensively studied. 177 Lu-labeled J 591 targeting the external domain of PSMA has shown efficacy in phase II clinical trials [7], which is encouraging for the development of novel RIT approaches in CRPC treatments. However, today, the development of resistance to the therapeutic regimens eventually renders all therapies suboptimal.|$|E
40|$|The {{two most}} popular agents for {{skeletal}} imaging, 85 Sr and 18 F, are not ideal for gamma camera sys tems because the counting efficiency for their high-energy photons of 0. 51 MeV is relatively low. More over, 85 Sr has a very long physical half-life of 65 days whereas the positron emitter, 18 F, has an incon veniently short half-life of 1. 83 hr. Because of these drawbacks, several other radionuclides with more desirable physical properties have been tried for skeletal imaging. Durbin et al (7) previously showed that the heavier lanthanons localize in the skeleton of rodents when administered carrier-free as citrates. Thereafter, HEDTA chelates of several reactor-produced rare earth nuclides, including 171 Er and 153 Sm, were successfully used (2) in both experi mental animals and in patients with osseous malig nancies. Exploration of the physical characteristics {{of all of the}} rare-earth radionuclides which have been prepared (3) indicated that cyclotron-produced 157 Dyshould be a superior agent for skeletal scan ning or camera imaging. It has no beta emission. Its monoenergetic gamma emission of 326 keV under goes little internal conversion, and its external photon yield is high (91 % of all distintegrations). It has a half-life of 8. 1 hr and decays by electron capture to 157 Tb (half-life, 150 years), which decays in turn to stable 157 Gd.

40|$|This {{educational}} presentation {{will give}} an overview about the clinical application of targeted alpha therapy (TAT) introduced until now. From Bi- 213 tagged antibodies {{in patients with}} lymphoma and leukemia to the clinical evaluation in malignant melanoma and more recently the applications of chelateable alpha-nuclides to label peptide analogs of somatostatin in neuroendocrine tumors or substance P in brain tumors. The most advanced clinical application is currently achieved for the treatment with the <b>bone</b> <b>seeker</b> Ra- 223 (Alpharadin). Most of the radiopharmaceuticals used for TAT are counterparts of established beta-therapies. We will discuss possible {{pros and cons of}} TAT in direct comparison to their corresponding beta-compounds. The limited availability of alpha-nuclides has prevented proliferation of TAT into clinical routine for a long time. In the meantime a cyclotron based production of Ac- 225 has been developed and more experience with clinical Ac- 225 /Bi- 213 generators is available. The production of Ac- 227 /Ra- 223 generators by neutron irradiation of Ra- 226 in a reactor is widely scalable. Therefore these alpha-emitting nuclides might be producible in unlimited amounts, once their clinical benefit has been proven. We will discuss perspectives for the implementation of these nuclides/generators into clinical routine. Ac- 225 and Ra- 223 decay in a sequence of four alpha disintegrations. We will discuss the relevance of translocation of the intermediate decay products and possible co-medication to avoid their accumulation in liver and kidneys. Still challenging for the future proliferation of alpha based therapies is the limitation of providing micro-dosimetry with diagnostic surrogates in SPECT and PET. Eventually alpha-radiopharmaceuticals must be evaluated more similar to chemotherapeutics than the classical dose estimation established for the radiation planning with beta emitters. Educational Objectives: 1. 	To give an overview about the clinical application of targeted alpha therapy introduced until now and how these treatments do compete in comparison to their corresponding beta-compounds, respectively. 2. 	Learning about the specific challenge in dosimetry and therefore dose-finding for radionuclides with insufficient emission of gamma radiation / bremsstrahlung and in regard to the heterogeneous dose distribution due to the short particle range. Implications for planning future studies. 3. 	(Short) review of generator systems suitable for clinical routine. 4. 	Possible co-medication to control the radioactive decay products of some alpha-nuclides. JRC. E. 5 -Nuclear chemistr...|$|E
