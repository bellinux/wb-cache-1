5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E
5|$|Also, whilst {{productivity}} {{figures have}} improved, median incomes and stock market prices, {{and thus the}} returns to capital and labor, have not improved. Furthermore, government consumption (government activity excluding transfer payments) represents between 15–20% of GDP, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> sector is measured at cost it becomes less and less productive as it grows larger. Thus, the more government consumption there is, the more published GDP figures tend to overestimate growth in living standards.|$|E

5|$|Belarus {{was once}} a major center of European Jews, with 10% of the {{population}} being Jewish. <b>But</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> mid-20th century, the number of Jews has been reduced by the Holocaust, deportation, and emigration, so that today {{it is a very}} small minority of less than one percent. The Lipka Tatars, numbering over 15,000, are predominantly Muslims. According to Article 16 of the Constitution, Belarus has no official religion. While the freedom of worship is granted in the same article, religious organizations deemed harmful to the government or social order can be prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Below Winsford, {{the course}} of the river has been altered several times, by the {{construction}} of cuts and locks, to enable small ships to trade on it. The river formerly joined the River Mersey at Weston Marsh, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> construction of the Manchester Ship Canal, begun in 1887, it has flowed into the canal, from where surplus water enters the Mersey by the Weaver sluices, just upstream of the junction. The tidal river section below Frodsham has been bypassed by the Weston Canal since 1810, and is no longer navigable, as Frodsham Lock is derelict.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{equipment}} and positions was extensively developed for military {{use by the}} French in 1915, soon followed by other World War I armies. In both world wars, artists were recruited as camouflage officers. Ship camouflage developed via conspicuous dazzle camouflage schemes during WWI, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> development of radar, ship camouflage has received less attention. Aircraft, especially in World War II, were often painted with different schemes above and below, to camouflage them against the ground and sky respectively.|$|E

5|$|China has 48% of the world's {{reserves}} of rare-earth elements, the United States has 13%, and Russia, Australia, and Canada have significant deposits. Until the 1980s, the U.S. led {{the world in}} rare-earth production, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> mid-1990s China has controlled the world market for these elements. The mines in Bayan Obo near Baotou, Inner Mongolia, are currently the largest source of rare-earth metals and are 80% of China's production. In 2010 China accounted for 97% of the global production of 17 rare-earth elements. Since 2006 the Chinese government has been imposing export quotas reducing supply {{at a rate of}} 5% to 10% a year.|$|E
5|$|During Pryer's {{tenure of}} being the first {{resident}} of Sandakan, one of his first tasks was to establish law and order. <b>But</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> local natives, although cowed by the guns of the British Navy, considered the British as transgressors in their land, they were hostile towards the authority of the British North Borneo Company. Hence, Pryer had to import his police from India and Singapore. His first contingent of police was made up of Indian Sikhs with a large body stature. The Indian police were probably from the Sepoy Company in India and were generally called 'Sipai' by the locals.|$|E
5|$|England {{is highly}} industrialised, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1970s {{there has been}} a decline in {{traditional}} heavy and manufacturing industries, and an increasing emphasis on a more service industry oriented economy. Tourism has become a significant industry, attracting millions of visitors to England each year. The export part of the economy is dominated by pharmaceuticals, cars (although many English marques are now foreign-owned, such as Land Rover, Lotus, Jaguar and Bentley), crude oil and petroleum from the English parts of North Sea oil along with Wytch Farm, aircraft engines and alcoholic beverages.|$|E

5|$|Fairley {{travelled}} to New Guinea {{at the end}} of June 1943 {{and arranged}} for Plasmodium falciparum cases to be evacuated to Cairns for treatment. As the flight time from Port Moresby to Cairns was only a few hours, this was considered safe, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> disease can be fatal if not treated promptly, Fairley was concerned lest the cases be delayed for some reason. Movement Control suggested that a special priority be allocated to such cases, and Major General Frank Berryman suggested calling it priority Neil after Fairley himself. Because movement priorities had to have five letters, an extra L was added on the end. Priority Neill soon came to be applied to the entire Cairns project.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Chaoyong and Yangwei {{continued}} to operate together. They operated out of Taku, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> water froze over during winter, they would spend {{that part of}} the year in the Korean port of Chemulpo (now Incheon). During the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Chaoyong remained with the fleet and was supporting troop transports when they made contact with a Japanese fleet on the morning of 17 September.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} the {{horticulture}} industry focussed on registered selections of Banksia spinulosa, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> late 1990s {{more and more}} cultivars of Banksia ericifolia have come on the market, including colour variants and dwarf forms. The latter are particularly attractive as the original plant may reach 6metres in height, and the new cultivars help enthusiasts choose a plant that is right for their conditions and tastes. Banksia ericifolia is also grown for the cut flower industry in Australia, though not {{to the degree that}} the western Australian species such as B.coccinea and B.menziesii are.|$|E

5|$|Making a final {{stand against}} Kefka, the {{characters}} destroy him, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> gods' power {{had come to}} reside in him all magicite begins to shatter and Kefka's magically-maintained tower begins to crumble. The Returners make their escape, though if Terra is present, she begins to weaken due to her half-esper heritage. However, before her father's magicite shatters, his spirit informs her that by holding to the human side of herself, she may survive the passing of magic. In the end, the party escapes Kefka's Tower aboard the Falcon. Terra survives, and the group observes the world's communities rejuvenating themselves.|$|E
5|$|Mentzer and Mohan {{also wrote}} {{a series of}} generic RPG {{adventure}}s called Gary Gygax Presents Fantasy Master. They also began working on a third line of products, which began with an adventure written by Mentzer called The Convert (1987); Mentzer had written the adventure as an RPGA tournament for D, but TSR {{was not interested in}} publishing it. Mentzer got verbal permission to publish it with New Infinities, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> permission was not in writing TSR filed an injunction to prevent the adventure's sale, although the injunction was later lifted. The legal costs further drained NIPI of capital.|$|E

5|$|Spurs remade for CharlesII {{are taken}} from the altar and {{presented}} to the monarch. They are made of solid gold, richly embossed with floral patterns and scrolls, and have straps of crimson velvet embroidered in gold. Known originally as StGeorge's Spurs, {{they are one of}} the emblems of knighthood and chivalry, and denote the sovereign's role as Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. Gold spurs were introduced into the coronation ceremony in 1189 at the coronation of RichardI. Historically, the spurs were fastened to the monarch's feet <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> Restoration they are simply brushed against the heels of kings or shown to queens and placed on the altar.|$|E
