40|$|Terrestrial life {{appears to}} have arisen very quickly during late accretion, {{sometime}} between approximately 3. 5 and 4. 2 Ga. During this same time, liquid water {{appears to have}} been abundant at the surface of Mars and it is quite plausable that life originated there as well. We now believe that the last common ancestor of terrestrial life was a sulfur-metabolizing microbe that lived at high temperatures. Rooting of the RNA tree in thermophily probably reflects high temperature "bottle-necking" of the biosphere by giant impacts during late accretion, sometime after life had originated. If high temperature <b>bottle-necking</b> is a general property of early biosphere development, Martian life may have also developed in close association with hydrothermal systems. Several independent lines of evidence suggest that hydrothermal processes have played an important role during the geological history of Mars. Because hydrothermal deposits on Earth are known to capture and retain abundant microbial fossil information, they are considered prime targets in the search for an ancient Martian biosphere. An important step in planning for future landed missions to Mars is the selection of priority targets for high resolution orbital mapping. Geotectonic terranes on Mars that provide a present focus for ongoing site selection studies include channels located along the margins of impact crater melt sheets, or on the slopes of ancient Martian volcanoes, chaotic and fretted terranes where shallow subsurface heat sources are thought to have interacted with ground ice, and the floors of calderas and rifted basins. Orbital missions in 1996, 1998 and 2001 will provide opportunities for high resolution geological mapping at key sites in such terranes, as a basis for selecting targets for future landed missions for exopaleontology...|$|E
40|$|In western countries, consanguineous {{marriage}} often arouses curiosity and prejudice in approximately equal measure, {{despite the fact}} that until the mid-nineteenth century cousin marriages were common in Europe and North America. Attitudes to consanguinity remain very different {{in other parts of the}} world, in particular north and sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Turkey and central Asia, and south Asia, where between 20 % and 50 % of current marriages are contracted between biological relatives, with first cousin unions especially common. Besides intra-familial marriage, in these regions a large majority of marriages also occur within long-established male lineages, e. g. clans, tribes in Arab societies and castes in India. Through time these lineages effectively become separate breeding pools, with founder effect, mutation, genetic drift and <b>bottle-necking</b> separately and collectively influencing gene pool composition. The present chapter first considers the concepts of random and assortative mating and then examines demographic, social, economic, and religious variables that influence the prevalence of preferred types of {{consanguineous marriage}}. The effects of consanguinity on human mate choice, reproductive success, and reproductive compensation are identified, and the impact of consanguinity on morbidity and mortality in infancy, childhood and adulthood are discussed and quantified. Three detailed case studies are then used to illustrate the influence of endogamy and consanguinity on human genetic variation and genetic disease: the Finnish Disease Heritage; inter-and intra-population genetic differentiation in India; and the distribution of specific alleles in Arab Israeli communities. The scale of global migration during the last two generations, with many millions of individuals, families, and occasionally entire communities moving within and between continents, has created an entirely new scenario in human population genetics. Against this background, consanguinity has re-emerged both as an important feature of community and public health genetics, and as a topic of general interest...|$|E

Viable System Model (VSM) in practice would assist the viability investigation process, prescribe, and facilitate the agreed improvements from operation division to policy management as {{the highest level of}} the system. Rather than focusing only on the internal factors, as an entrepreneurial system, batik Solo industrial cluster has to gain deeper insight from the external aspects like consumer and market. This study also employs the concept of value co-creation from service science perspective to compliment the powerful internal assessment of the system by VSM with the external one by using a positive collaborative innovation with customers as a third dimension. The concept encourages entrepreneurial system to weight more on the role of customers as the crucial element determining business future performance. The finding is a mapping model of the industry, the roles, and the improvement from viable value co-creation point of view which consist of five functional and complete working organs: (1) operation, (2) coordination, (3) integration, (4) intelligent, and (5) brain. The operation represents the executive systems: firms (Kauman batik cluster, Laweyan batik cluster, Solo traditional market, and travel agencies), research and financial institution (Canting Kakung Community and Bank of Central Java), and university (Universitas Negeri Sebelas Maret and Batik University). The coordination is a mutual assistance of the convergent understanding among operation systems: Batik Surakarta Entrepreneur Union (PPBS), Laweyan Batik Village Development Forum (FPKBL), and Kauman Batik Tourism Village Association (PKWBK).

40|$|In {{industry}} and laboratories, {{statistical process control}} (SPC) {{is often used to}} check the performance of processes. The need for multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) becomes more important as the number of variables that can be measured increases. It is common practice to use principal component analyses (PCA) or partial least squares (PLS) to construct multivariate control charts. However, PCA and PLS are linear in nature whereas many processes exhibit nonlinear relations between the process parameters and the quality parameters (i. e. the settings and the product). An example of such a nonlinear relation is the value of the pH {{as a function of the}} input flow of an acid and a base. In this paper the first approach of a novel method is presented which uses the centre hidden neurons of a <b>bottle-neck</b> neural network to perform nonlinear MSPC. The output of the <b>bottle-neck</b> network are the reconstructed input set and a predicted dependent set. Furthermore, a special case of a <b>bottle-neck</b> neural network (an auto-associative neural network) is also used for nonlinear MSPC. The output of auto-associative neural networks is a reconstruction of the input set. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
