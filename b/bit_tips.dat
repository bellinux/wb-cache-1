40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} {{a series of}} ignition tests with two types of conical bits (plumb bob and pencil) used on continuous mining machines, to determine their ignition potential at various bit speeds, cut depths, and wear conditions.

The bits impacted blocks of Berea sandstone in a 6. 5 pet methane atmosphere at various bit speeds and cut depths. In a new condition, the plumb bob bits were considerably more incendive than the pencil bits, causing ignitions in 32 of 35 tests at 60 rpm, compared with ignitiolls in 2 of 22 tests for the pencil bits. The results from new bit testing also show that reduction of <b>bit</b> <b>tip</b> velocity to 180 fpm does not eliminate ignition potential.

For resonance to occur, one of the natural frequencies of a structural component must be excited by a cyclic force of the same frequency. In this case, the frequency of drill bit chattering due to motor rotation equaled the spring frequency (cycles per second), and the system was unstable. A soft rust coating on the steel to be drilled permitted chattering to start at the drill <b>bit</b> <b>tip,</b> and the <b>bit</b> oscillated on and off of the surface, which increased the wear rate of the drill bit.

Additionally, a sample tube can be housed inside the inner tube for storing the sample. The inner tube fits inside the outer tube, which fits inside the drill tube. The inner and outer tubes can move axially relative to each other. The inner tube presents two lamellae with two opposing grabbing teeth and one pushing tooth. The pushing tooth is offset axially from the grabbing teeth. The teeth can move radially and their motion is controlled by the outer tube.

40|$|Each brittle rock has a {{characteristic}} critical impact energy at which fractures develop extensively. This threshold energy level {{depends on the}} size distribution of flaws within the rock. The impact energy required for fracture development has been estimated and verified experimentally {{for a variety of}} rocks. A single impact below the critical energy level deforms the rock elastically and causes minor crushing. Crushing results from stress concentration at the <b>bit</b> <b>tip.</b> At critical energy, cracks propagate through the rock. Above the critical energy, crushing and cracking are the dominant failure modes. Rebound measured with a special fracture hammer on a variety of rocks correlated with ultrasonic pulse velocities as regards the indication of fracture development at critical impact energy. The impact energy required to cause fracture was marked by a sharp decrease in the hammer rebound. Point load tests showed up to 70 percent decrease in rock strength about the fracture energy level. The radius of the fractured zone delineated with ultrasonic tests ranged from 4 to 7 cm;The effectiveness of percussive impacts as a means of reducing rock strength is proven in this investigation. Results have significance in mechanical excavation of hard and abrasive rocks. Hard rock trenching requires higher cutting forces than available rotary trenchers can exert. Based on obtained results, a rational design is proposed for a percussion trencher. This trencher would prefracture and hence, weaken hard rocks by percussive impacts before drag bit action. Recommendations have also been made on the field use of the special impact hammer which was developed for this research.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contributes {{a structured}} {{understanding of the}} fundamental processes involved in developing context-aware computing applications for the civil infrastructure industry. The civil infrastructure industry is characterized by mobile human and machine agents actively engaged in real-time decision-making tasks in a dynamic and unstructured workspace environment. This distinguishes context-aware computing from other computing technologies in three aspects: 1) it {{has the ability to}} perceive, interpret, and adapt to the agent’s evolving workspace; 2) It streamlines project data and presents the agent with information pertinent to its context, thus eliminating the agent’s tasks to accomplish the same; 3) By leveraging contextual information, it supplements decision-making tasks in real-time. This research has successfully investigated technical approaches to address fundamental aspects of introducing context-aware applications to civil engineering, including: the ubiquitous localization of mobile agents in dynamic, unstructured environments; abstraction of the spatial-context and identifying the objects of interest to the agent; and the suitability of using standard models to manage and organize data for context-aware computing applications. A computational framework for designing context-aware applications to support real-time decision-making has also been implemented. The framework allows researchers and other end users to leverage currently available context-sensing technology to design and implement innovative solutions to domain specific problems. The researched methods have been validated through several experiments conducted at the University of Michigan, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Michigan Department of Transportation. These experiments have resulted in the implementation of several applications – to support real-life decision-making tasks – that not only serve to illustrate the usefulness of the framework, but also have significant social and economic implications. Among these applications are the controlled drilling system that warns drilling personnel when the drill <b>bit</b> <b>tip</b> is about to strike rebar or utility lines, thus helping preserve the structural integrity of concrete decks and preventing utility strike accidents; an automated fault detection system that diagnoses faulty components of an underperforming HVAC distribution network; and an innovative bridge inspection solution that supports condition assessment decision-making, thus introducing objectivity to visual condition assessment by providing concurrence with the Structural Health Monitoring data...|$|R
40|$|The {{results from}} the Phoenix mission led {{scientists}} to believe {{it is possible that}} primitive life exists below the Martian surface. Therefore, drilling in Martian soil in search for organisms is the next logical step. Drilling on Mars is a major engineering challenge due to the drilling depth requirement and extreme environment condition. Mars lacks a thick atmosphere and a continuous magnetic field that shield the planet’s surface from solar radiation and solar flares. As a result, the Martian surface is sterile and if life ever existed, it must be found below the surface. NASA’s Mars Exploration Payload Advisory Group proposed that drilling should be considered as a priority investigation on Mars in an effort of finding evidence of extinct or extant life. The {{results from the}} Curiosity mission suggested drilling six meters deep in the red planet in search for life. Excavation tools deployed to Mars so far have been able to drill to a maximum depth of 6. 5 cm. Thus, the drilling capabilities need to be increased by a factor of approximately 100 to achieve the goal of drilling six meters deep. This requirement puts a demand on developing new and more effective technologies to reach this goal. Previous research shows evidence of a promising drilling mechanism in rotary-ultrasonic for what it offers in terms of high surface quality, faster rate of penetration and higher material removal rate. This research addresses the need to understand the mechanics of the drill <b>bit</b> <b>tip</b> and rock interface in rotary-ultrasonic drilling performance of one drill bit at a time drilling in three types of rocks that vary in strength.

One hundred and fifteen patients were included; 63. 5 % were adults, 73. 2 % were females, and 14. 4 % had epilepsy. Adults presented more ictal eye closure (p= 0. 006), convulsions lasting > 2 min (p< 0. 001), postictal speech change (p= 0. 021), vocalization during the “tonic-clonic” phase (p= 0. 005), and pelvic thrust movement (p= 0. 035). <b>Biting</b> the <b>tip</b> or side of the tongue and opisthotonos were rare and only present in adults.

40|$|Ultrasonic/sonic rotary-hammer drill (USRoHD) is {{a recent}} {{addition}} to the collection of apparatuses based on ultrasonic/sonic drill corer (USDC). As described below, the USRoHD has several features, not present in a basic USDC, that increase efficiency and provide some redundancy against partial failure. USDCs and related apparatuses were conceived for boring into, and/or acquiring samples of, rock or other hard, brittle materials of geological interest. They have been described in numerous previous NASA Tech Briefs articles. To recapitulate: A USDC {{can be characterized as}} a lightweight, lowpower, piezoelectrically driven jackhammer in which ultrasonic and sonic vibrations are generated and coupled to a tool bit. A basic USDC includes a piezoelectric stack, an ultrasonic transducer horn connected to the stack, a free mass (free {{in the sense that it}} can bounce axially a short distance between hard stops on the horn and the bit), and a tool bit. The piezoelectric stack creates ultrasonic vibrations that are mechanically amplified by the horn. The bouncing of the free mass between the hard stops generates the sonic vibrations. The combination of ultrasonic and sonic vibrations gives rise to a hammering action (and a resulting chiseling action at the tip of the tool bit) that is more effective for drilling than is the microhammering action of ultrasonic vibrations alone. The hammering and chiseling actions are so effective that unlike in conventional twist drilling, little applied axial force is needed to make the apparatus advance into the material of interest. There are numerous potential applications for USDCs and related apparatuses in geological exploration on Earth and on remote planets. In early USDC experiments, it was observed that accumulation of cuttings in a drilled hole causes the rate of penetration of the USDC to decrease steeply with depth, and that the rate of penetration can be increased by removing the cuttings. The USRoHD concept provides for removal of cuttings in the same manner as that of a twist drill: An USRoHD includes a USDC and a motor with gearhead (see figure). The USDC provides the bit hammering and the motor provides the bit rotation. Like a twist drill bit, the shank of the tool bit of the USRoHD is fluted. As in the operation of a twist drill, the rotation of the fluted drill bit removes cuttings from the drilled hole. The USRoHD tool <b>bit</b> is <b>tipped</b> with a replaceable crown having cutting teeth on its front surface. The teeth are shaped to promote fracturing of the rock face through a combination of hammering and rotation of the tool bit. Helical channels on the outer cylindrical surface of the crown serve as a continuation of the fluted surface of the shank, helping to remove cuttings. In the event of a failure of the USDC, the USRoHD can continue to operate with reduced efficiency as a twist drill. Similarly, in the event of a failure of the gearmotor, the USRoHD can continue to operate with reduced efficiency as a USDC...|$|R
40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Anatomic {{study of}} the {{internal}} carotid artery (ICA) location with respect to C 1 based on computed tomography (CT) scans with contrast medium. OBJECTIVE: To measure {{the location of the}} ICA relative to the anterior aspect of C 1 to assess the risk of placing C 1 -C 2 transarticular or C 1 lateral mass screws. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebral artery injury is a known risk from placement of screws in C 1. A previous case report revealed an ideally placed C 1 -C 2 transarticular screw abutting and narrowing the ICA. The risk of ICA injury from C 1 screws is unknown. METHODS: Fifty random head and neck CT scans with contrast medium were retrospectively analyzed. Measurements were taken bilaterally including the closest distance from the ICA lumen to C 1 and the distance from the medial edge of the ICA to a line drawn along the medial border of the foramen transversarium. The risk of inserting bicortical C 1 -C 2 transarticular and C 1 lateral mass screws was estimated based on these measurements. RESULTS: The mean distance from the ICA to C 1 was 2. 88 mm on the left and 2. 89 mm on the right. The ICA lumen was medial to the foramen transversarium in 42 (84 %) of 50 cases (mean: 2. 78 mm on the left and 3. 00 mm on the right). The proximity of the ICA to C 1 posed moderate risk in 46 % of cases and high risk in 12 % (on at least one side). CONCLUSION: Because of the risk of ICA injury from a drill <b>bit</b> or the <b>tip</b> of a bicortical screw, we recommend preoperative CT scan with contrast medium in all cases in which a screw is to be placed into C 1. If the ICA is in close proximity to the anterior border of C 1, unicortical fixation or a different fusion technique should be considered...|$|R
5000|$|Each probe in the {{cantilever}} array {{stores and}} reads data thermo-mechanically, handling one bit at a time.To accomplish a read, the probe tip is heated to around 300 °C {{and moved in}} proximity to the data sled. If the probe is located over a pit the cantilever will push it into the hole, increasing the surface area {{in contact with the}} sled, and in turn increasing the cooling as heat leaks into the sled from the probe. In the case where there is no pit at that location, only the very tip of the probe remains in contact with the sled, and the heat leaks away more slowly. The electrical resistance of the probe is a function of its temperature, rising with increasing temperature. Thus when the probe drops into a pit and cools, this registers as a drop in resistance. A low resistance will be translated to a [...] "1" [...] bit, or a [...] "0" [...] bit otherwise. While reading an entire storage field, the tip is dragged over the entire surface and the resistance changes are constantly monitored. To write a <b>bit,</b> the <b>tip</b> of the probe is heated to a temperature above the glass transition temperature of the polymer used to manufacture the data sled, which is generally acrylic glass. In this case the transition temperature is around 400 °C. To write a [...] "1", the polymer in proximity to the tip is softened, and then the tip is gently touched to it, causing a dent. To erase the bit and return it to the zero state, the tip is instead pulled up from the surface, allowing surface tension to pull the surface flat again. Older experimental systems used a variety of erasure techniques that were generally more time consuming and less successful. These older systems offered around 100,000 erases, but the available references do not contain enough information to say if this has been improved with the newer techniques. As one might expect, the need to heat the probes requires a fairly large amount of power for general operation. However, the exact amount is dependent on the speed that data is being accessed; at slower rates the cooling during read is smaller, as is the number of times the probe has to be heated to a higher temperature to write. When operated at data rates of a few megabits per second, Millipede is expected to consume about 100 milliwatts, which is in the range of flash memory technology and considerably below hard drives. However, one of the main advantages of the Millipede design is that it is highly parallel, allowing it to run at much higher speeds into the GB/s. At these sorts of speeds one might expect power requirements more closely matching current hard drives. Data transfer speed is limited to the kilobits-per-second range for an individual probe, which amounts to a few megabits for an entire array. Experiments done at IBM's Almaden Research Center showed that individual tips could support data rates as high as 1 - 2 megabits per second, potentially offering aggregate speeds in the GB/s range.|$|R
