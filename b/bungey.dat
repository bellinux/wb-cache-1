For PopMatters, Associate Music Editor Justin Cober-Lake writes: [...] "In many ways, it's a supreme accomplishment with difficult technique passages and broad soundscapes; on the other hand, it's a journey that's too long to take." [...] In {{his review of}} Corea's later work The Ultimate Adventure, Will Friedwald of The New York Sun writes: [...] "'To the Stars' was trite, electronic bubblegum music {{that sounded like a}} cheesy video-game soundtrack." [...] Writing in The Times, John <b>Bungey</b> comments that [...] "many of the pieces are straitjacketed into the cosmic concept", concluding his review with: [...] "If you prefer hi-fi to sci-fi, then you will be hoping that Corea leaves the space helmet at home next time." [...] John L. Walters gave the album a negative review in The Guardian, writing that the album [...] "cries out for warning stickers - 'this album contains dangerously high levels of Scientology'", and that it [...] "drags some perfectly fine jazz musicians ... through conceptual purgatory".|$|E

The review in The Times by John <b>Bungey</b> was more positive. He noted {{that it was not}} a [...] "generally sad affair, hard-to-take document" [...] as are most final recordings of great artists, but instead [...] "a compelling last testament of a mighty group and a fine human being". Nick Coleman's review in The Independent was mixed; he wrote that the [...] "tempos border on the frantic, phrases are spat, the will to trade licks is never less than testosteronal" [...] but quipped that for [...] "every sublime passage there's a butch one". John Fordham of The Guardian contrasted the release to Zawinul's 2005 live album Vienna Nights. One difference he emphasized was [...] "the typhoon drumming of Paco Sery and a battalion of percussionists [...] gives Zawinul the option of letting long stretches of the music simply groove". He also noted that there was no comparable track with the duet with Shorter on Vienna Nights.|$|E

50|$|Young {{was elected}} to the Kondinin Road Board (later the Shire of Kondinin) in 1954, and served as its {{chairman}} from 1959 until 1967, when he stood for the by-election in Roe necessitated by the resignation of the sitting Country member, Tom Hart. His only opponent was Liberal candidate Mel <b>Bungey,</b> who was later elected to the federal House of Representatives. Young's majority decreased at both the 1968 and 1971 state elections, and at the latter poll the final margin between him and the next-best candidate, independent Leonard Gleeson, was less than 200 votes - Young finished with 51.32% of the two-candidate preferred vote. Young was chairman of the state Country Party from 1971 and 1974, and in July 1973, following Sir Crawford Nalder's retirement, was elected deputy leader, replacing the new leader, Ray McPharlin. A member of various parliamentary committees, Young lost his seat to the Liberal candidate, Geoff Grewar, at the 1974 election. In a three-cornered contest between Labor, the Liberals, and the National Alliance (a brief merger of the Country Party and the Democratic Labor Party), Young received 43.35% on first preferences, but could only gain 48.24% of the final count as the vast majority of Labor preferences flowed to the Liberals. After leaving parliament, Young was {{chairman of the board of}} Claremont Teachers College (later the Western Australian College of Advanced Education), and was also involved with the National Parks Authority. He died in Wembley, a suburb of Perth, in April 2012, aged 93.|$|E

30|$|Detecting {{inclusions}} such as acid slags {{in steel}} mill products without causing damage {{is important for}} guaranteeing their quality and performance. Ultrasonic waves are widely used to detect inclusions, and the size and location of the inclusions can be evaluated from the flight time and amplitude of the scattered wave (Sachse 1975; Bifulco & Sachse 1975). In general, an ultrasonic signal is affected by changes in size and shape {{as well as the}} elastic properties of the inclusions. Over the past few decades, many studies on material characterization using ultrasonic waves have been reported. A technique to determine the grain size and homogeneity of materials using backscattered ultrasonic waves was proposed by Willems and Goebbels (Willems & Goebbels 1981). Castagnède et al. showed the decision method to determine the elastic constants in solid using frequency shift information and the velocity of an ultrasonic wave (Castagnède et al. 1990). Luo and <b>Bungey</b> used surface waves to determine the Young modulus and Poisson ratio of concrete materials (Luo & <b>Bungey</b> 1996), and Rogers utilized the phase velocity of Lamb waves for the estimation of the elastic constants in plates (Rogers 1995).|$|E

40|$|Systematic {{screening}} of patients for areas of health risk in their lifestyle has much potential for {{primary health care}} clinicians as a cost-effective and time saving means to identify 'at risk' individuals. In the area of alcohol and drug problems, such early identification {{increases the likelihood of}} successful intervention. The present study, conducted at a general practice unit, compared the use of a computer to screen for alcohol and drug use with the two more traditional assessment methods of face-to-face interview and paper and pencil questionnaire. It was found that levels of reported consumption were similar across assessment methods. Although the interview method was strongly preferred overall, patients' preference for the computer increased significantly after use. The computer was also found to be more acceptable to patients reporting non-medical drug use, a potentially threatening and sensitive issue. There was a low refusal rate and most patients were willing to allow their doctor to see the assessment results. This indicates that screening for alcohol and drug use is acceptable to general practice patients, and that the computer can play a useful role as a prevention aid. Jillian B. <b>Bungey,</b> Rene G.

40|$|Transit {{times of}} {{longitudinal}} pulses that travel near reinforcing steel bars are usually smaller than in plain concrete. Chung first, and then <b>Bungey,</b> demonstrated {{the importance of}} including bar diameters in the correction factors when pulses propagating parallel and near to the bars can not be avoided. Besides the influence of geometric dispersion and mode conversion on pulse propagation, there is an effect due to a specific pattern of radial variation of longitudinal wave velocities {{from the surface of}} the embedded steel bar. Wall effects produce a region (a sheath) of concrete surrounding the steel bar, with smaller longitudinal pulse velocities in comparison with the velocity farther away from the bar. Then the acoustic energy travels trapped in a kind of composite leaky waveguide with a velocity less than the compression (P) wave velocity in steel and in concrete but greater than the extensional wave velocity in steel. A mathematical model of the propagation of a longitudinal wave-packet is constructed, taking into account both attenuation and dispersion effects. An asymptotic analysis of pulse propagation and the introduction of a threshold of detection in the receiving transducer, allows the derivation of an approximate analytical formula for transit times. Then the meaning of transit times in NDT of concrete is discussed. The abovementioned formula is used to study the effects of the reinforcing bar radius, the propagatio...|$|E
