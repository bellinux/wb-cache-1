5000|$|The Supreme Court heard two motions.

The correlation between <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top 5 percent and the next 15 percent is [...]. 92. This strong correlation means that higher <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next 15 percent in some states than others are not an indication of greater tax regressivity {{at the top of}} the income distribution. Hence, the revenue-dampening effect of higher <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next 15 percent cannot be interpreted as an effect of regressivity on tax volatility. We suspect that the result is related to the very weak correlation between next- 15 burdens and changes in AGI.|$|R

Amdocs's asserted claims recite such conventional operation, in such a general way, {{that even if the}} inventor had developed an actual working system, the patent claims could foreclose fields of research beyond the actual invention.
