5|$|The {{animal is}} {{mentioned}} in Sanskrit texts as the krishna mrig. According to Hindu mythology, the <b>blackbuck</b> draws the chariot of Lord Krishna. The <b>blackbuck</b> {{is considered to}} be the vehicle of Vayu (the wind god), Soma (the divine drink) and Chandra (the moon god). In Tamil Nadu, the <b>blackbuck</b> {{is considered to be}} the vehicle of the Hindu goddess Korravai. In Rajasthan, the goddess Karni Mata is believed to protect the <b>blackbuck.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{antelope}} is {{native to}} and found mainly in India, while it is extinct in Bangladesh. Formerly widespread, only small, scattered herds are seen today, largely confined to protected areas. During the 20th century, <b>blackbuck</b> numbers declined sharply due to excessive hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation. The <b>blackbuck</b> has been introduced in Argentina and the United States. In India, hunting of <b>blackbuck</b> is prohibited under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The <b>blackbuck</b> has significance in Hinduism; Indian and Nepali villagers do not harm the antelope.|$|E

25|$|The main herbivores of Gir are chital, nilgai, sambar, four-horned antelope, {{chinkara}} {{and wild}} boar. <b>Blackbucks</b> {{from the surrounding}} area are sometimes seen in the sanctuary.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variety of}} wild animals are found at Chandra Prabha. These include <b>blackbucks,</b> chital, sambar, nilgai, wild boar, {{porcupine}} and chinkara. The reptilian species include gharial and python.|$|R
5|$|The <b>blackbuck</b> has {{associations}} with the Indian culture. The antelope {{might have been}} a source of food in the Indus Valley civilisation (33001700 BCE); bone remains have been discovered in sites such as Dholavira and Mehrgarh. The <b>blackbuck</b> is routinely depicted in miniature paintings of the Mughal era (16th to 19th centuries) depicting royal hunts often using cheetahs. Villagers in India and Nepal generally do not harm the <b>blackbuck.</b> Tribes such as the Bishnois revere and care for most animals including the <b>blackbuck.</b> The <b>blackbuck</b> has been declared as the state animal of Andhra Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blackbuck</b> bear a close {{resemblance}} to gazelles, and are distinguished mainly {{by the fact}} that while gazelles are brown in the dorsal parts, <b>blackbuck</b> develop a dark brown or black colour in these parts.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, <b>blackbuck</b> numbers {{declined}} sharply due {{to excessive}} hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation. Some blackbucks are killed illegally especially {{where they are}} sympatric with nilgai. Until India's independence in 1947, <b>blackbuck</b> and chinkara were hunted in many princely states with specially trained captive Asiatic cheetahs. By the 1970s, <b>blackbuck</b> were extinct in several areas. Nevertheless, populations in India have increased from 24,000 in the late 1970s to 50,000 in 2001.|$|E
50|$|It {{is known}} for its temples, havelis and 18th-century forts. Chhapar, near Sujangarh, is famous for <b>blackbucks</b> and its Tal Chhapar sanctuary. The Salasar Balaji Temple is 25 km from Sujangarh.|$|R
500|$|Ballabhpur Wildlife Sanctuary near Santiniketan was {{declared}} a sanctuary in 1977. Economically important trees are planted here and <b>blackbucks,</b> spotted deer, jackals, foxes {{and a variety}} of water birds live in its [...]|$|R
50|$|Animals {{living in}} this {{national}} park include a few hundred <b>blackbucks</b> (the state animal of Andhra Pradesh), porcupines, water monitors, short-toed eagles, Indian pond herons, egrets, kingfishers, cormorants and several other bird species.|$|R
5|$|In some {{agricultural}} areas in northern India, the <b>blackbuck</b> {{are found in}} large numbers and raid crop fields. However, {{the damage caused by}} <b>blackbuck</b> is far lower than that caused by the nilgai.|$|E
5|$|The hide of the <b>blackbuck</b> (krishnajina in Hindi) {{is deemed}} to be sacred in Hinduism. According to the scriptures, {{it is to be}} sat upon only by brahmins (priests), sadhus and yogis (sages), forest-dwellers and bhikshus (mendicants). <b>Blackbuck</b> meat is highly {{regarded}} in Texas. In an analysis, <b>blackbuck</b> milk was found to have 6.9% protein, 9.3% fat, and 4.3% lactose.|$|E
5|$|Being herbivores, <b>blackbuck</b> graze on low grasses, {{occasionally}} browsing as well. They prefer sedges, fall witchgrass, mesquite, {{and live}} oak. They have occasionally been observed browsing on acacia {{trees in the}} Cholistan Desert. Oats and berseem {{were found to be}} palatable and nutritious to captive populations in a study. A study in the Velavadar Black Buck Sanctuary (Gujarat, India) showed that Dichanthium annulatum comprised 35 percent of their diet. Digestion of nutrients, especially crude proteins, was poor in summer, but more efficient in the rainy and winter seasons. Consequently crude protein intake in summer was very low, even below the recommended value. <b>Blackbuck</b> had a lower food consumption in summer. The fruits of Prosopis juliflora are often eaten, and <b>blackbuck</b> {{may play a role in}} their dispersal. Prosopis becomes a significant food item if grasses are scarce. Water is a daily requirement of the <b>blackbuck.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ballabhpur Wildlife Sanctuary near Santiniketan was {{declared}} a sanctuary in 1977. Economically important trees are planted here and <b>blackbucks,</b> spotted deer, jackals, foxes {{and a variety}} of water birds live in its 2 km2.|$|R
50|$|The fauna {{population}} of the park mainly includes <b>blackbucks,</b> wolves, Macqueen's bustards, hyenas and lesser floricans, with foxes, jackals and jungle cats as the main carnivores. Other species include wild pigs, hares and rodents typical of the savannah type grasslands and thorn scrubs.|$|R
50|$|The Indian {{wild dogs}} feed on small and larger herbivorous mammals such as chital, sambar, <b>blackbucks,</b> deer, wild boar, Asiatic water buffalo, nilgai and gaur. On few occasions, Ussuri dholes also hunt {{elephant}} calves {{and may also}} feed on onagers and kiangs.|$|R
5|$|<b>Blackbuck</b> is {{native to}} the Indian subcontinent, but extinct in Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|Scrublands are a {{good source}} of forage and cover. Cold climates do not suit the <b>blackbuck.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>blackbuck</b> {{is listed}} as Least concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
50|$|Chinkaras are preyed upon by leopards, Bengal tigers, and dholes. The {{chinkara}} was {{a common}} prey of the Asiatic cheetah in India alongside <b>blackbucks.</b> Outside protected areas they may be attacked by pariah dogs, and both wolves and golden jackals are also known to hunt them.|$|R
40|$|Four <b>blackbucks,</b> 4 - 6 {{years of}} age were handled for dystocia {{with a history of}} {{straining}} and without successful delivery. Clinical examination revealed normal vital parameters, partially opened cervix and dry birth canal. Water bags were ruptured in all cases. In three out of four cases (75 %), the fetus was extracted out using standard obstetrical operations; however, one fetus (25 %) was taken out using fetotomy. All fetuses were dead after assisted delivery. Three out of four (75 %) dams were found active and behaved normally after delivery, however, one dam (25 %) died soon after obstetrical procedure. It was concluded that dystocia in <b>blackbucks</b> can be effectively handled on similar lines as in caprines and timely veterinary assistance is required in order to save the newborns...|$|R
50|$|Large animals {{found in}} the {{sanctuary}} include several types of deer (Sambar Deer, <b>Blackbucks,</b> Muntjac, Chital) as well as wild boar and peacocks.

40|$|In February 2012, a {{reproductive}} {{group of}} 60 adult <b>blackbucks</b> (Antilope cervicapra) from Veracruz, Mexico was relocated to hunting units in eastern and northeastern Mexico. Seven individuals died due to hemorrhagic parasitic, abomasitis and enteritis caused by Haemonchus spp., Setaria spp., and Trichostrongylids. Deaths {{were associated with}} hepatic necrosis, bilateral congestive distention of heart and fibrinonecrotic bronchopneumonia. Also Anaplasma marginale was identified. The blackbucksâ€™ population displayed a general mortality rate of 11. 67 %, where 25 % of total male and 9. 62 % of total female died. The mortality was controlled by segregation of all remaining <b>blackbucks</b> and the treatment for internal and external parasites (biting flies and ticks). After the treatment, no fatality cases related to parasitosis were recorded. The results presented here exhibit the high relevance of parasitosis as possible factor risk in the survival of tis specie...|$|R

50|$|There is a {{wildlife}} sanctuary dedicated to 'antelope and great Indian bustard' in the North of Town. There are <b>Blackbucks</b> and Great Indian Bustards in this sanctuary. Many rare wildlife are also there in this sanctuary. They include hyenas, pythons, Shekaroos (Giant squirrels), monkeys, baboons, jackals, wolves, chitals, peacocks and many rare birds including hariyals, mynas, bulbuls, doves.|$|R
5|$|The <b>blackbuck</b> inhabits grassy {{plains and}} {{slightly}} forested areas. Due to their regular need of water, they prefer areas where water is perennially available.|$|E
5|$|The white fur on {{the chin}} and around the eyes is in sharp {{contrast}} with the black stripes on the face. The coat of males shows two-tone colouration: while the upper parts and outsides of the legs are dark brown to black, the underparts and the insides of the legs are all white. Darkness typically increases as the male ages. On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. In Texas, <b>blackbuck</b> moult in spring, following which the males look notably lighter, though darkness persists on the face and the legs. On the contrary, males will grow darker as the breeding season approaches. Both melanism and albinism have been observed in wild <b>blackbuck.</b> Albino <b>blackbuck</b> are often zoo attractions as in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Andhra Pradesh, India).|$|E
5|$|A. c. cervicapra (Linnaeus, 1758) : Known as {{the southeastern}} <b>blackbuck.</b> Occurs in southern, {{eastern and central}} India. The white eye ring of the male is narrow above the eye and the leg stripe is well defined and reaches all along the leg.|$|E
50|$|The zoo has {{collections}} of reptiles, mammals, and birds. Among mammals, the zoo has a white tiger and a male Bengal tiger named Tanaji. Other mammals {{at the zoo}} include leopard, sloth bears, sambhars, barking deer, <b>blackbucks,</b> monkeys, and elephants. Reptiles include Indian rock python, cobra, snakes, vipers, Indian crocodiles and Indian star tortoise and birds such as peafowl also feature.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{preliminary}} study {{was to assess the}} effects of 2 forms of environmental enrichment (i. e., branched tree trunk and brushes) on the behavior of a group of 8 captive <b>blackbucks.</b> Animals were directly observed for 4 hours a day (09 : 30 - 11 : 30 and 12 : 30 - 14 : 30), on days 1, 3, 6 (pre-enrichment phase, before the new individual was born), 8, 10, 15, 17 (pre-enrichment phase, after the birth of the new individual), 22, 24, 29, 31, 43, 64 (enrichment phase), using instantaneous scan sampling every minute. Video recordings were also performed in days 24, 43, 64, from 09 : 30 to 11 : 00 and from 12 : 30 to 14 : 00 and analyzed using a continuous behavioral sampling method, for activities directed to the tree trunk. Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were performed both on the total number of scans and on the percentage of scans in which the animals were not out-of-sight. The <b>blackbucks</b> interacted significantly more with the tree trunk than with the brushes (P = 0. 012). The duration of the interactions with the tree trunk declined over time (P < 0. 001). The animals increased their feeding activity and decreased their rumination while in the standing position in the enrichment phase in comparison with the 2 preceding phases. The results of {{this preliminary}} study suggest a slightly beneficial effect of the provision of a tree trunk for <b>blackbucks</b> as a form of environmental enrichment and highlight some problems when observing this prey species...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} much {{scientific}} interest in environmental enrichment {{as a mean to}} improve the welfare of animals kept in captivity and to prevent stereotypies and other forms of abnormal behaviour. However, ungulates have been little studied in this respect in comparison with other species. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the behavioural effects of the introduction of a tree-trunk with branches and two brushes as forms of environmental enrichment for a group of eight <b>blackbucks</b> (one adult male, one sub-adult male, two young males, three adult females, one young female) kept in captivity in an outdoor enclosure with shelters. The animals were observed for four hours a day (09 : 30 - 11 : 30 and 12 : 30 - 14 : 30), twice a week, for two weeks pre-enrichment and two weeks post-enrichment, using instantaneous scan sampling every minute. The observation took place between October and December 2011. Statistical analyses were performed using Wilcoxon test for paired data. When the enrichments were present, the animals were significantly (Z= 2. 38; p= 0. 017) more visible in the enclosure, were lying inactively less (Z= 2. 52; p= 0. 012), performed more self-grooming (Z= 2. 52; p= 0. 012), sniffed other animals less (Z= 2. 24; p= 0. 025), and were more often displaced by another animal (Z= 2. 11; p= 0. 035). The <b>blackbucks</b> also interacted with the tree-trunk significantly more than with the brushes (Z= 2. 37; p= 0. 018). It is concluded that a tree-trunk with branches could be a useful short- to medium- term enrichment for <b>blackbucks</b> in captivity...|$|R
