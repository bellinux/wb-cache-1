Baird would give up her bed to Lennon, and share Jackie's double bed. Dykins used to give Lennon weekly pocket money (one shilling) for doing odd jobs, such as collecting golf balls on the local course, on top of the five shillings that Lennon's Aunt Mimi gave him. During Lennon's visits, he would climb trees with Baird and Jackie, test Baird's spelling, and once gave Baird half-a-crown to leave him alone when he wanted to kiss his first girlfriend. Baird remembered that after Lennon had visited them, her mother would often play a record called, My Son John, To Me You Are So Wonderful, [...] "by some old crooner, and sit and listen to it". [...] "My Son John"—sung by David Whitfield—was released in 1956. Although Mimi sent Lennon to his Aunt's croft in Sango Bay, Durness, Scotland, for his holidays, he later persuaded Mimi to let him take short holidays in North Wales with the Dykins family. Julia took Baird and Jackie to Rosebury Street, Liverpool, to watch Lennon play with The Quarrymen {{on the back of a}} flatbed coal truck on 22 June 1957. Baird was allowed to sit on the back, but as the music was too loud she asked to be taken off. The Quarrymen played twice that day as part of a celebration to mark the 750th anniversary of the granting of Liverpool's charter by King John. Lennon and McCartney would later rehearse in the bathroom of Blomfield Road <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> the acoustics [...] "sounded like a recording studio".|$|E

2500|$|For many years, the {{government}} of the People's Republic of China forbade performance of Turandot <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> it portrayed China and the Chinese unfavourably. In the late 1990s they relented, and in September 1998 the opera was performed for eight nights as Turandot at the Forbidden City, complete with opulent sets and soldiers from the People's Liberation Army as extras. It was an international collaboration, with director Zhang Yimou as choreographer and Zubin Mehta as conductor. The singing roles saw Giovanna Casolla, Audrey Stottler, and Sharon Sweet as Princess Turandot; Sergej Larin and Lando Bartolini as Calaf; and Barbara Frittoli, Cristina Gallardo-Domâs, and Barbara Hendricks as Liù. As with Madama Butterfly, Puccini strove for a semblance of Asian authenticity (at least to Western ears) by using music from the region in question. Up to eight of the themes used in Turandot appear to be based on traditional Chinese music and anthems, and the melody of a Chinese song named [...] "Mò Li Hūa (茉莉花)", or [...] "Jasmine", is included as a motif for the princess.|$|E

I thought 'Thank you, I'll take that'!" [...] "Revolution from me bed" [...] most likely refers to Lennon's notorious bed-ins in 1969. The piano in {{the introduction of the}} song strongly resembles Lennon's [...] "Imagine", as well as [...] "Watching the Wheels". As Oasis are often criticised for borrowing parts of other artists' songs for their own, Noel Gallagher commented on the intro's similarity to [...] "Imagine" [...] saying, [...] "In the case of Don't Look Back in Anger – I mean, the opening piano riff's Imagine. 50% of it's put in there to wind people up, and the other 50% is saying 'look, this is how songs like Don't Look Back in Anger come about – because they're inspired by songs like Imagine'. And no matter what people might think, there will be some 13 year old kid out there who'll read an interview and think 'Imagine? I've never heard that song' and he might go and buy the album, you know what I mean?" [...] Gallagher also admits that he was under the influence of illegal substances when he wrote the song and to this day he claims he does not know what it means.|$|E
2500|$|Barrichello's helmet {{is white}} with an orange-red Oval shape on the rear, an orange-red shape around the visor, an orange red line under the helmet {{and a blue}} circle on the top with azure and sky blue {{cylinders}} – similar to those on the helmet of former world champion Emerson Fittipaldi – with a golden star in the middle (usually five-pointed, although the recent designs had it six-pointed). The white part of the helmet changed to silver for some races during the 1999 season. After signing for Ferrari in 2000, teammate Michael Schumacher changed the colours of his helmet at the Monaco Grand Prix to avoid confusion, since the two drivers' original helmet colours were identical (the only real difference being that Schumacher's helmet had a red band which wrapped around its back from the visor, fading into gold and back). At the 2001 Brazilian Grand Prix, the oval shape and the shape around the visor were painted to resemble the Brazilian flag, and at his 300th Grand Prix, his helmet once again carried the Brazilian flag colours. At the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix he had the helmet livery of fellow Brazilian and good friend Tony Kanaan, who in turn had Barrichello's helmet livery while racing in 2006 Indianapolis 500 which was held {{on the same day}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> it would be the closest either of them would get to competing in the biggest race of the year of the category the other raced in.

2500|$|On August 30, 2011, it was {{announced}} that ABC bought Moore's pitch for Hangtown, a Western drama series. Hangtown is the third potential venture to be attempted under the deal between Moore's production company, Tall Ship Productions, and Sony Pictures TV. The series was co-created by Ron D. Moore and former Caprica writer Matt Roberts. Hangtown is described as [...] "a Western with procedural elements" [...] that takes place in a frontier town in the early 1900s grappling with the development of the railroad. The potential series would revolve around the town's old-fashioned veteran marshal who solves crimes by drawing on instinct and experience, who butt heads with the young new East Coast crime-solving doctor who relies on emerging forensics and rational inquiry. Added to the mix is a young female writer who has come to the west to write pulp stories about stereotyped [...] "Wild West" [...] crime, to send back to big city dime-novel publishers back East. Tall Ship Productions announced via their Twitter-feed on October 18, 2011, that Justin Lin, director of several films in The Fast and the Furious franchise, had signed on to direct a potential pilot episode of Hangtown, in the event that ABC officially orders it. [...] However, The Hollywood Reporter and Wired.com pointed out that Hangtown would be facing stiff competition, as a half-dozen other potential Western series were currently in development from all major networks as well as several cable channels, as part of a general wave of revitalized interest in the genre. (Apart from AMC's Western-genre series Hell On Wheels, which had already garnered critical praise after its premiere in November 2011, TNT was developing the series Gateway, CBS was developing Ralph Lamb, and NBC was developing an as-yet untitled Western from Friday Night Lights producer Peter Berg. Moreover, ABC itself was already developing another Western series, Gunslinger, which might affect its choice of whether to pick up a second Western show produced by Moore, similar to how a wave of new fantasy-genre series were pitched to major networks in early 2011, such as ABC's Once Upon a Time, and NBC was faced with two potential fantasy series, Grimm or Moore's own 17th Precinct. Due to this heavy competition, NBC chose not to pick up 17th Precinct for a full series.) In an interview with Wire.com on September 29, 2012, Moore was asked about the status of his proposed Western series The Wild Wild West (reboot for CBS) and Hangtown (for ABC), and stated that the projects had been cancelled. Moore said, [...] "Yeah, ABC decided not to go with it. That was very frustrating. They made a strategic decision that they didn’t want to do a Western, period. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> they loved the script and the characters, and said they bought three Westerns because they were so committed to it.
