5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} episode, Wirt and Greg wake up in a hospital, with Greg telling a story but being cut off <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> hear what it's about. As the scene ends, Greg's frog begins to glow, due to having eaten a magic bell in The Unknown, {{suggesting}} that there was at least some physical aspect to the story. The series ends with a slow montage of how Wirt and Greg affected the inhabitants of the Unknown.|$|E
5|$|A {{narrative}} rational for {{the concept}} of Hell {{can be found in}} the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. This narrative ends with Yudhishthira's visit to hell after being offered acceptance into heaven. This journey creates a scene for the audience that helps illustrate the importance of understanding hell as well as heaven before accepting either extreme. This idea provides an essential lesson regarding Dharma, a primary theme within the Mahabharata. Dharma is not a black and white concept, and all people are not entirely good or entirely evil. As such, tolerance is essential in order to truly understand the “right way of living”. We all must understand the worst to truly understand and appreciate the best just as we must experience the best <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> experience the worst. This narrative utilizes the Hindu religion in order to teach lessons on tolerance and acceptance of one another's faults as well as virtues.|$|E
25|$|Having {{established}} that the sources of natural variation are mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, Dobzhansky considers what shapes and preserves this variation. In {{the first edition of}} this book, he considers genetic drift as important as natural selection. As an example, he argued that drift was the reason for racial variations that were observed in Partula, a land snail, so these variations had no adaptive advantage. He argued that most such variations, which he called microgeographic race, was nonadaptive. Because variation is not always controlled by selection, we need to know the size of a population <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> predict its evolutionary dynamics.|$|E

25|$|Deeper {{analysis}} is needed <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> understand why these distinctions {{should result in}} {{a difference in the}} twins' ages. Consider the spacetime diagram of Fig.2‑11. This presents the simple case of a twin going straight out along the x axis and immediately turning back. From the standpoint of the stay-at-home twin, there is nothing puzzling about the twin paradox at all. The proper time measured along the traveling twin's world line from O to C, plus the proper time measured from C to B, is less than the stay-at-home twin's proper time measured from O to A to B. More complex trajectories require integrating the proper time between the respective events along the curve (i.e. the path integral) to calculate the total amount of proper time experienced by the traveling twin.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense {{to say that it was}} not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, {{there were}} {{concerns}} over the fleet's capable lifespan. Several projects beyond the B-52, the Convair B-58 Hustler and North American XB-70 Valkyrie, had either been aborted or proved disappointing in light of changing requirements, which left the older B-52 as the main bomber {{as opposed to the}} planned successive aircraft models. On 19 February 1965, General Curtis E. LeMay testified to Congress that the lack of a follow-up bomber project to the B-52 raised the danger that, [...] "The B-52 is going to fall apart on us <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get a replacement for it." [...] Other aircraft, such as the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, later complemented the B-52 in roles the aircraft was not as capable in, such as missions involving high-speed, low-level penetration dashes.|$|E

500|$|As a holiness church, the PHC {{believes}} {{that for the}} Christian there is not only justification and forgiveness for actual transgressions but also [...] "complete cleansing of the justified believer from all indwelling sin and from its pollution." [...] This cleansing is not [...] "maturity" [...] but a [...] "crisis experience" [...] and a [...] "definite, instantaneous work of grace, obtainable by faith." [...] The church recognizes that there is maturity and growth {{in the life of}} the believer, but states that [...] "we must get into this grace <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> grow in it." [...] The sanctified life is described as [...] "one of separation from the world, a selfless life, a life of devotion to all the will of God, a life of holiness ... a life controlled by 'perfect love' which 'casteth out fear.'" [...] The Pentecostal Holiness Church specifically rejects absolute perfection, angelic perfection, and sinless perfection—terms that imply that it is impossible for a sanctified believer to commit sin.|$|E
500|$|During the 2016 general {{election}} campaign, McEntee {{expressed concern that}} the area around the Newgrange monument, which is in her constituency, risks becoming a [...] "dead zone" [...] due to restricted planning regulations in the vicinity which often prevents the building of new homes and facilities. She supports the teaching of politics in schools, as well as lowering the voting age to 16. She also believes more women should be encouraged to go into politics, and as a minister has spoken of her support for the idea of gender quotas as a way of increasing the number of female politicians. She favours the option of extending the Fair Deal scheme to include home care. Michael Brennan, of the Irish Independent has described McEntee's support of small food business as [...] "one of the brightest stories {{to come out of the}} recession". On the UK's Brexit process, McEntee has spoken of the importance of building certainty between the UK and EU: [...] "We must deal with the past and lay the foundations of a trusting relationship <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> build the future".|$|E

2500|$|The Women Under Siege Project {{was begun}} by Gloria Steinem in 2012 {{in order to}} {{document}} violence against women taking place during violent conflicts. The idea was inspired by two books: Sexual Violence Against Jewish Women During the Holocaust by Sonja M. Hedgepeth and Rochelle Saidel and At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape and Resistance - a New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to Black Power by Danielle McGuire. After reading these two books which addressed sexual violence, Steinem wondered if there were {{lessons to be learned}} from both history and current affairs; and also, if information were more widely available and people were aware of the issues, if rape and gender-based violence could be prevented in the future. She has said that [...] "suffering has to be visible and not called inevitable or blamed on the victim <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> stop it." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{described}} by Pitchfork, the album's lyrics address [...] "the emotional and environmental costs of modernity run amok".

Will we destroy rare invaluable flora and fauna <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> research and exploit their unique properties? In the end, {{is it going to}} be the red-barked tree that's going to hold the cure for cancer?" [...] Newman stated about the song, [...] "It's got an open-eyed beauty to it, looking at the world as a mysterious place. It's more like Pentangle than Wire! Wire have never made a track anything like it: it's in ¾ time, with acoustic guitars, bouzouki and organ. It's an innovative track for Wire – perhaps the most different. There's nothing in our catalogue that sounds anything like it, and that pleases me immensely." ...|$|E

50|$|This {{is another}} correct {{sequential}} history. It {{is also a}} linearization!

Hence the original history is indeed linearizable.|$|R
