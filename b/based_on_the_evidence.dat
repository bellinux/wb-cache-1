Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in a wagon {{the next day to}} Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from being lynched. Wyatt testified that he thought the shooting was accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius' pistol could be fired from half-cock. Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the shooting was not intentional. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> presented, Brocius was not charged with White's death.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March 1612, Alizon Device, {{who lived}} {{just outside the}} Lancashire village of Fence, near Pendle Hill, {{encountered}} John Law, a pedlar from Halifax. She asked him for some pins, which he refused to give to her, {{and a few minutes}} later Law suffered a stroke, for which he blamed Alizon. Along with her mother Elizabeth and her brother James, Alizon was summoned to appear before local magistrate Roger Nowell on 30March 1612. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> and confessions he obtained, Nowell committed Alizon and ten others to Lancaster Gaol to be tried at the next assizes for maleficium, causing harm by witchcraft.|$|E
5|$|The 14-day {{trial of}} Took began on 11 July 2005 before Justice Lai Kew Chai in the High Court. The {{prosecution}} relied on 76 witnesses, a video in which Took re-enacted the murder, forensic evidence and an autopsy that found several bruises on Huang Na's head. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence,</b> the prosecution alleged that Took lured Huang Na to the storeroom, then stripped and sexually assaulted her. After smothering and stomping {{on her to}} ensure her death, he stored her body in nine layers of plastic bags stuffed into a sealed cardboard box. The defence relied on the claim of diminished responsibility. Psychiatrist R. Nagulendran argued that Took was schizophrenic, as some of his behaviour, such as frequently smiling to himself and talking of spirits, was inappropriate {{and he had no}} motive for the murder – Nagulendran also called Took's story about the three Chinese men a delusion.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: There {{are many}} kinds of methods to {{evaluate}} the inventory management and economic performance of small and medium enterprises, {{but they still have}} some distinct shortcomings. In order to achieve a better evaluation result, we put forward a new model <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidences</b> from developing country like India. Approach: This survey study, mainly <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidences</b> from machine tool SMEs in India uses statistical methods to avoid the drawbacks of qualitative techniques. Findings: Through empirical data, it is established that ‘technology’ is not the only concern, but other factors related to human resource, economic, organizational and behavioral aspects of SMEs are also vital in improving their IM performance. Originality: This study combines the role of factors such as managerial, technological, economical and contingency {{together for the first time}} in the context of SMEs. </p...|$|R

5|$|In 1996, Marion Archibald and Valerie Fenwick {{proposed}} an alternative hypothesis, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> of East Anglian coins and post-Conquest documents. Acknowledging that Beonna and Beornred {{were the same}} person, they suggested that after Ælfwald's death in 749, Æthelwald of Mercia installed Beornred/Beonna to rule northern East Anglia and Alberht (who probably belonged to the Wuffingas dynasty) to rule in the south. According to Archibald and Fenwick, after Æthelbald was murdered in 757, Beornred/Beonna became king of Mercia, during which his coinage was increased in East Anglia, perhaps to meet “military requirements”. Then, after a reign {{of only a few}} months, he was deposed by Offa and forced to flee from him back into East Anglia. Alberht, who had attempted to re-establish East Anglia as an independent kingdom and rule alone, and had succeeded for a short time, was deposed by Beornred/Beonna when he arrived as an exile in about 760. Soon afterwards, Offa asserted his authority over the East Angles in around 760-5 and removed Beonna.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} Ahmose's pyramid in Abydos were {{discovered}} in 1899 and identified as his in 1902. Most of its outer casing stones had been robbed for use in other building projects over the years, and the mound of rubble upon which it was built has collapsed. However, two rows of intact casing stones were found by Arthur Mace, who estimated its steep slope as about 60 degrees, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> of the limestone casing (compare to the less acute 51 degrees of the Great Pyramid of Giza). Adjacent to the main pyramid temple and to its east, Harvey has identified two temples constructed by Ahmose's queen, Ahmose-Nefertary. One of these structures also bears bricks stamped {{with the name of}} Chief Treasurer Neferperet, the official responsible for re-opening the stone quarries at el-Ma'asara (Tura) in Ahmose's year 22. A third, larger temple (Temple C) is similar to the pyramid temple in form and scale, but its stamped bricks and details of decoration reinforce that it was a cult place for Ahmose-Nefertary.|$|E
5|$|The {{verdict was}} treated with scepticism by much of the {{international}} media and the U.S. government of President Jimmy Carter. On 2 February 1978, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> given at the inquest, {{the attorney general of}} the Eastern Cape stated that he would not prosecute the officers. After the inquest, Biko's family brought a civil case against the state; at the advice of their lawyers, they agreed to a settlement of R65,000 (US$78,000) in July 1979. Shortly after the inquest, the South African Medical and Dental Council initiated proceedings against the medical professionals who had been entrusted with Biko's care; eight years later two of the medics were found guilty of improper conduct. The failure of the government-employed doctors to diagnose or treat Biko's injuries has been frequently cited as an example of a repressive state influencing medical practitioners' decisions, and Biko's death as evidence of the need for doctors to serve the needs of patients before those of the state.|$|E
