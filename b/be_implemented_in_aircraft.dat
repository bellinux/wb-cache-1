40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the effects of}} adverse climatic conditions (sand-dust and high temperature) on aircraft reliability and maintenance. An important and necessary part of the research was conducting field work in aircraft maintenance organisations in Kuwait {{in order to identify}} the problems and associated difficulties from the adverse climatic conditions on aircraft systems and aircraft maintenance. Also collected were data and aircraft samples so that they could be analysed to construct models which can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>aircraft</b> maintenance. This research has shown that there are three main systems affected by sand-dust, namely engine, avionics and air conditioning. Engine system experienced significant impact by sand-dust. The PM 1 Q concentration of sand-dust was found to be the dominant particle size in all three aircraft systems. The PM 10 concentration and meteorological parameters were found to be significantly correlated. Two prototype models were constructed, namely Model 1 and Model 2. Forecasts of PM 1 Q concentration value is generated from meteorological parameters in Model 1. The percentage of deterioration of engine HPT blade from sand-dust contamination is predicted from engine flight data, PM 10 concentration and meteorological parameters by Model 2. Both models were tested using historic data and found to accurately predict the PM 10 concentration and deterioration of engine HPT blade respectively. In summary, this research provides a novel approach to improve aircraft reliability and maintenance in. arid and semi-arid regions Where sand-dust is dominant, by the implementation of the two prototype models.

40|$|Explosive {{growth of}} {{commercial}} air travel poses great challenges to {{air traffic management}} and causes in-creasing delays. Much of the delay is weather induced. The traditional routing strategy, which consists of an aircraft under a predicted storm avoiding the bad weather zone completely, is too conservative. One way to reduce delays caused by enroute weather {{is to take a}} less conservative route, risking higher delay to attain a better expected delay, instead of avoiding the bad weather zone completely. <b>In</b> order to <b>implement</b> this strategy, one approach involves shifting the current airspace-based air traffic management system to a trajectory-based air traffic management (TB-ATM) system where there is only one controller responsible for each aircraft from gate to gate. We address the single aircraft problem using Markov decision processes (where the weather processes is modeled as a stationary Markov chain) and a dynamic program-ming algorithm. The approach provides a dynamic routing strategy for an aircraft that minimizes the expected delay, when the aircraft’s nominal path may be obstructed by a bad weather.

As designs of the air flight control system evolve, there is a demand for development of a robust control system to provide on-time arrivals of all flights regardless of bad weather conditions.

40|$|Aviation {{operations}} negatively impact global climate, degrade surface air quality, {{and create}} noise. Towards mitigating these effects, this thesis considers electro-aerodynamic (EAD) propulsion, {{a form of}} in-atmosphere electrostatic propulsion, which requires no on-board propellant and has zero primary gaseous emissions. In addition, thrust generation {{has the potential to}} be nearly silent and requires no moving parts. Despite these advantages, however, EAD propulsion has yet to <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> fixed-wing <b>aircraft,</b> <b>in</b> part due to the limited understanding of EAD thruster performance. The objective of this thesis is to determine the feasibility and viability of EAD propulsion <b>in</b> fixed-wing <b>aircraft</b> applications. This thesis begins with a theoretical assessment of EAD thruster performance. This includes quantification of fundamental thrust density limits and the effect of interacting electric fields on thrust-to-power performance due to closely spaced electrode pairs. Additionally, performance as a function of altitude and vehicle flight speed is quantified, where thrust-to-power ratio is estimated to decrease as both increase. Next, this thesis experimentally assesses the achievable thrust density of EAD propulsion. Current and thrust generated from arrays of electrode pairs are observed to be a function of non-dimensional pair spacings for both parallel and staged operation. A thrust per unit area of 2 - 3 N/m² and per unit volume of 5 - 15 N/m³ are estimated, achieving approximately 50 and 10 % of the corresponding one-dimensional space-charge limits, respectively. Results suggest that EAD propulsion is most readily viable at the small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) scale. Finally, based on the conclusions of the thrust density assessment, this thesis presents the development of a first-of-its-kind EAD-propelled, small-UAV prototype with the goal of achieving steady-level flight. A design space analysis is performed, determining that designs capable of steady-level flight potentially exist. The prototype development effort concludes with at-scale performance quantification of the primary EAD UAV subsystems. Results indicate that the achievable weight-to-thrust ratio is comparable to the vehicle lift-to-drag ratio. This thesis concludes that at the selected scale of the UAV prototype, EAD propulsion is potentially viable, and steady-level flight is, at worst, "nearly" feasible with the current design. by Christopher Kenneth Gilmore.

40|$|The recent {{penetration}} of distributed generation (DG) into existing electricity grids {{and the consequent}} development of active distribution networks (ADNs) have prompted an exploration of power distribution in a dc microgrid paradigm. Although dc power distribution has <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>aircraft,</b> ships, and communication centres, the technology is still {{at an early stage}} and must be investigated with respect to technical feasibility when applied to distribution systems. In particular, the operation of a dc microgrid in both grid-connected and islanded modes and its integration into an existing ac infrastructure are subject to significant challenges that impede the practical realization of dc microgrids. On one hand, because the dc voltage profile is coupled with the injected active power at the system buses, it is seriously influenced by the intermittent nature of renewable resources such as solar and wind energy. In islanded operating mode, the presence of system resistance leads to a further trade-off between an appropriate system voltage profile and a precise power management scheme. On the other hand, the development of hybrid ac/dc microgrids introduces a fresh operational philosophy that enhances power sharing among ac and dc subgrids through the coupling of ac and dc steady-state variables. 	With these challenges as motivation, the primary goal of this thesis was to develop effective power management schemes and a steady-state analysis tool that can enable the reliable integration of dc microgrids into a smart hybrid ac/dc paradigm. Achieving this objective entailed the completion of three core studies: 1) the introduction of a robust control scheme for mitigating voltage regulation challenges associated with dc distribution systems (DCDSs) that are characterized by a high {{penetration of}} distributed and renewable generation, 2) the proposal of a supervisory control strategy for precise DG output power allocation that is based on DG rating and operational costs yet guarantees an appropriate voltage profile for islanded dc microgrids, 3) the development of an accurate and comprehensive power flow algorithm for analyzing the steady-state behaviour of islanded hybrid ac/dc microgrids, and 4) the optimization of hybrid ac/dc microgrids configuration. 	As the first research component, a novel multi-agent control scheme has been developed for regulating the voltage profile of DCDSs that incorporate a large number of intermittent energy sources. The proposed control scheme consists of two sequential stages. In the first stage, a distributed state estimation algorithm <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> to estimate the voltage profile in DCDSs, thus enhancing the interlinking converter (IC) operation in regulating the system voltages within specified limits. If the IC alone fails to regulate the system voltages, a second control stage is activated and executed through either equal or optimum curtailment strategy of the DG output power. A variety of case studies have been conducted in order to demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and convergence characteristics of the control schemes that have been developed. 	The second element of this research is a multi-agent supervisory control that has been created in order to provide precise power management in isolated DC microgrids. Two aspects of power management have been considered: 1) equal power sharing, which has been realized via a proposed distributed equal power sharing (DEPS) algorithm, and 2) optimal power dispatch, which has been achieved through a proposed distributed equal incremental cost (DEIC) algorithm. Both algorithms offer the additional advantage of affording the ability to restore the average system voltage to its nominal value. Real-time OPAL-RT simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed algorithms in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) application. 	The third part of the research has introduced a sequential power flow algorithm for hybrid ac/dc microgrids operating in islanded mode. In contrast to the conditions in grid-connected systems, variable rather than fixed ac frequencies and dc voltages are utilized for coordinating power between the ac and dc microgrids. The primary challenge is to solve the power flow problem in hybrid microgrids in a manner that includes consideration of both the absence of a slack bus and the coupling between the frequency and dc voltage though ICs. In the proposed algorithm, the ac power flow is solved using the Newton-Raphson (NR) method, thereby updating the ac variables and utilizing them accordingly in a proposed IC model for solving the dc problem. This sequential algorithm is iterated until convergence. The accuracy of the algorithm has been verified through detailed time-domain simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC, and its robustness and computational cost compare favourable with those of conventional algorithms. 	The final part highlights the implementation of the developed steady-state models in obtaining an optimum hybrid microgrid configuration. The system configuration could be manipulated by changing the DG droop settings as well as the network topological structure. The contribution of both approaches has been investigated, through an optimum power flow (OPF) formulation, in improving the system loadability as the primary measure of the hybrid microgrid performance...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{performance}} of our A 320 during novel advanced required navigation performance (RNP) procedures which contain a fixed radius turn that delivers the aircraft onto a short ILS precision final. The approaches were flown automatically with guidance and autothrust as computed by the flight management system. Main areas of interest of these flight trials were the impact of the use of the described ARINC 424 coding options onto (a) the performance of the speed profile for arrival time optimization (b) the vertical path during the RNP part of the procedure and (c) the performance of the autoland capability after a curved transition onto an ILS final. Most recently, the aviation community recognized the potential for exploiting additional benefits from precise area navigations systems and introduced Performance Based Navigation (PBN) through ICAO Doc 9613 for new kinds of en-route, departure and approach procedures. RNP is part of the PBN concept. Within the PBN concept exists the possibility to incorporate turns with a precise ground track. These turns are called fixed radius transitions and are coded as radius-to-fix (RF) path terminators in the ARINC 424 database. They offer the advantage of repeatable ground tracks during the turn and thus more freedom for the procedure designer when route planning in dense traffic, high terrain or environments witch obstacles. Moreover, socio-economic factors can be included - such as circumnavigating noise sensitive areas with guaranteed track keeping performance precluding stray aircraft. Additionally, ARINC 424 allows specifying altitude constraints at waypoints and vertical path angles for each RNP segment terminating at such a waypoint. Whilst offering these benefits, such advanced RNP approach operations are still non-precision procedures and automatic landings cannot be performed after their successful completion. Hence, to enable automatic landings and to extract maximum benefits from RNP operations, they must transition into a precision final approach segment provided by any precision landing system (ILS, GLS, MLS). This is often called RNP to xLS (or RNP 2 xLS). Moreover, the vertical path angle feature is currently largely unused and unexplored, except for the final approach segment of an RNP approach. The approaches were entirely flown using the auto flight guidance in managed mode and with auto-thrust activated. We show supporting evidence that RNP 2 ILS approaches can be safely flown all the way to an automatic landing using the flight management guidance computer and the auto flight control system. In order to fly the desired path with vertical path angle during the RNP initial and intermediate approach, a separate mode (such as LNAV/VNAV) different from the singular approach mode would need to <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> the <b>aircraft.</b> Additionally, operators currently apply stabilization criteria following which the aircraft must be established on a straight final with the correct sink rate, fully configured at 1000 ft above aerodrome level. For landings in low visibility conditions, more stringent criteria are often applied. An operational implementation of RNP 2 ILS approaches with a curved final intercept would require a rephrasing of the criteria to include a concept, such as RNP established...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringMass transit bus {{is one of}} the key {{modes of}} transportation, {{especially}} in highly populated areas of the United States (US). Review of literature has shown that there is very little research, which focuses on the safety and comfort of a bus operator. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS). FARS shows that there were 300 fatal bus accidents during the period from 1995 to 1999. Statistical data also shows that 16 bus operators suffered fatal injuries during the period from 1991 to 2000. The operators end up driving for long duration of time, which makes the three-point type of belt restraint system uncomfortable. This may also lead to stress and fatigue. The use of a two-point seat belt restraint system may be more comfortable for the operator since his hands and torso will be unrestrained. However, the physical sled testing of this seat belt configuration revealed severe life threatening risk for the operator. It was observed that the Head Injury Criteria (HIC 15) value was above the threshold limit of 700 and the femur load value was well over their allowable threshold limit of 10, 000 N. The Neck Injury Criteria (Nij) value was very close to the allowable threshold limit of 1. Thus, safety and comfort of the transit bus operator appear to be contradictory to each other. In this research, an effort had been made to develop a methodology to design an airbag restraint system for a mass transit bus operator, which can satisfy the two contradictory objectives. An Inflatable lap belt type of airbag restraint system has <b>been</b> previously <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>aircraft</b> safety. This system is comprised of a two-point restraint type seat belt system with an airbag embedded in it. This type of airbag safety system was tested in this study for a mass transit bus operator with an aim to keep the HIC and the Nij values within allowable limits. Additional knee-padding was designed to minimize the femur loads. All of the research was conducted for frontal impact of a bus with the rigid-wall crash condition. A model development of a two-point restraint type seat belt system was carried out with the occupant simulation code, MADYMO. This model is validated with the help of physical sled test data. The baseline simulation model was used to develop the numerical model of an inflatable lap belt airbag restraint system. With the help of numerical models, the prototypes of airbag and inflators were manufactured. A physical sled test was also carried out for this system under frontal impact condition. This test data was utilized to validate the simulation results obtained from the MADYMO model. The physical sled testing as well as numerical models were developed for the three-point belt restraint system. Except the femur injury, all of the injuries were within the allowable safe limit. A physical sled test with the airbag and the knee-padding was also conducted to test the performance of an inflatable lap belt airbag restraint system. A knee-padding played a vital role to minimize the femur injury. The Results from this study can be utilized in the design and development of a safety belt system for optimal protection of mass transit bus operators in the event of a frontal impact crashes. This study can be utilized further for designing the safety restraint system for other crash conditions...|$|R
40|$|This Interface Control Document (ICD) {{documents}} the airspace adaptation and air traffic inputs of NASA's Future ATM Concepts and Evaluation Tool (FACET). Its intended audience is the project manager, project team, development team, and stakeholders interested in interfacing with the system. FACET equips Air Traffic Management (ATM) researchers and service providers {{with a way}} to explore, develop and evaluate advanced air transportation concepts before they are field-tested and eventually deployed. FACET is a flexible software tool that is capable of quickly generating and analyzing thousands of aircraft trajectories. It provides researchers with a simulation environment for preliminary testing of advanced ATM concepts. Using aircraft performance profiles, airspace models, weather data, and flight schedules, the tool models trajectories for the climb, cruise, and descent phases of flight for each type of aircraft. An advanced graphical interface displays traffic patterns in two and three dimensions, under various current and projected conditions for specific airspace regions or over the entire continental United States. The system is able to simulate a full day's dynamic national airspace system (NAS) operations, model system uncertainty, measure the impact of different decision-makers in the NAS, and provide analysis of the results in graphical form, including sector, airport, fix, and airway usage statistics. NASA researchers test and analyze the system-wide impact of new traffic flow management algorithms under anticipated air traffic growth projections on the nation's air traffic system. In addition to modeling the airspace system for NASA research, FACET has also successfully transitioned into a valuable tool for operational use. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) traffic flow managers and commercial airline dispatchers have used FACET technology for real-time operations planning. FACET integrates live air traffic data from FAA radar systems and weather data from the National Weather Service to summarize NAS performance. This information allows system operators to reroute flights around congested airspace and severe weather to maintain safety and minimize delay. FACET also supports the planning and post-operational evaluation of reroute strategies at the national level to maximize system efficiency. For the commercial airline passenger, strategic planning with FACET can result in fewer flight delays and cancellations. The performance capabilities of FACET are largely due to its architecture, which strikes a balance between flexibility and fidelity. FACET is capable of modeling the airspace operations for the continental United States, processing thousands of aircraft on a single computer. FACET was written in Java and C, enabling the portability of its software to a variety of operating systems. In addition, FACET was designed with a modular software architecture to facilitate rapid prototyping of diverse ATM concepts. Several advanced ATM concepts have already <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> FACET, including <b>aircraft</b> self-separation, prediction of aircraft demand and sector congestion, system-wide impact assessment of traffic flow management constraints, and wind-optimal routing...|$|R
