30|$|As larvae entered 6 days AH, the dorsal and pelvic spines {{started to}} form, and the larvae {{commenced}} active swimming behavior coupled with dynamic feeding activities at this stage, as more rotifer {{were found in}} the digestive tract. By the age of 25 days AH, both dorsal and pelvic spines were elongated, spiny and covered by melanophore layers. The larvae were seen as more aggressive, particularly in foraging prey and preferred Artemia and copepod compared to rotifers. Interestingly, the larvae started to aggregate around {{the central part of the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>tank,</b> instead of the other columns of the tank, and eventually switched to the benthic habitat.|$|E
40|$|Cold model {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} particle removal from the liquid phase using fine gas bubbles. Fine gas bubbles were created by flowing water through a tube in which a constriction was implanted, and injecting air underneath the constriction. The strong turbulent conditions underneath the constriction warranted formation and dispersion of fine bubbles in the tube. It {{was found that the}} probability of attachment of particles to bubbles in the tube was unity. When the aggregates of particle/bubble were discharged into the <b>bottom</b> <b>tank</b> where an abrupt change occurred in their relative movements, large particles were detached from the bubbles due to high inertial force and penetrated into the liquid in the tank, while small particles were kept attached to the bubbles and quickly floated up to the free surface of the tank. Under the present experimental conditions, polystyrene particles smaller than 500 × 10 - 6 m in diameter were mostly kept attached to the bubbles and floated up to the free surface of the <b>bottom</b> <b>tank,</b> while the ones larger than 500 × 10 - 6 m were detached from the bubbles and remained in the tank, circulating with water. This was in good agreement with the results predicted by the mathematical model reported previously. The wettability of a particle with the liquid was found to be an important factor in determining the removal efficiency of particles by attachment to bubbles. It was demonstrated that the process employed in the present study can be an effective technique for removing non-metallic inclusions from molten metals such as steel...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the combined {{use of a}} Kinect depth sensor and of a stochastic data assimilation method to recover free-surface flows. More specifically, we use a Weighted ensemble Kalman filter method to reconstruct the complete state of free-surface flows from a sequence of depth images only. This particle filter accounts for model and observations errors. This data assimilation scheme is enhanced {{with the use of}} two observations instead of one classically. We evaluate the developed approach on two numerical test cases: a collapse of a water column as a toy-example and a flow in an suddenly expanding flume as a more realistic flow. The robustness of the method to depth data errors and also to initial and inflow conditions is considered. We illustrate the interest of using two observations instead of one observation into the correction step, especially for unknown inflow boundary conditions. Then, the performance of the Kinect sensor to capture temporal sequences of depth observations is investigated. Finally, the efficiency of the algorithm is qualified for a wave in a real rectangular flat <b>bottom</b> <b>tank.</b> It is shown that for basic initial conditions, the particle filter rapidly and remarkably reconstructs velocity and height of the free surface flow based on noisy measurements of the elevation alone...|$|E

[2] [3] The pressure drop tests are done after the LH 2 Draining tests because of the relative high pressure drop, which is induced by the pressure drop measurement section itself. The high flow rates required for the draining tests could not be achieved with the assembled pressure drop measurement section. The measurement section is assembled again and various flow rates are adjusted to determine the relation between the occurring pressure drop of the feed line and volume flow. The highest flow rate achieved (1, 6 l/s) is lower than the required flow rate for the draining tests (1, 651 l/s), but with the determination of the related pressure drop curve it is possible to extrapolate the pressure drop...|$|E

40|$|Western Research Institute (WRI) has {{developed}} a process titled TaBoRR{trademark} (<b>Tank</b> <b>Bottom</b> Recovery and Remediation) that remediates <b>tank</b> <b>bottom</b> wastes and recovers refinery acceptable crude oil. This work provides: support for the field demonstration unit; equipment, materials, and labor for construction and operation of a laboratory unit; and numerical and economic modeling of the process. This report includes an interim update on Task 1. 4 entitled {open_quotes}Tank Bottom Waste Processing using the TaBoRR{trademark} Process,{close_quotes} which includes {{the results of the}} work to date. The objective of this work is to develop information for the successful deployment of WRI`s patented TaBoRR technology. This objective is being accomplished by providing: technology support to the field demonstration unit, the design and operation of a laboratory process unit, and numerical and economic analysis. The results of the work performed under this task are reported. Presently, the level of effort in support of the field demonstration unit has been limited to analysis of two sources of <b>tank</b> <b>bottom</b> wastes. The results of these analyses indicate that the samples contain solid concentrations from 1 to 9 wt % and water concentrations between 10 and 53 wt %. Certain analytical separation techniques should be avoided in the separation of components contained in <b>tank</b> <b>bottom</b> wastes. Also reported are the true boiling point curves for the crude oil present in the <b>tank</b> <b>bottom</b> wastes. The design of the laboratory unit is complete and is reported. Component sizes obtained during the design effort have been confirmed by a numerical simulator. Currently, the construction of the laboratory unit is approximately 95 % complete.

50|$|Type A Independent Tanks are {{prismatic}} {{and supported}} on insulation-bearing blocks typically consisting of wooden chocks and located by anti-roll chocks {{located at the}} top of the tank inside the void space and anti-flotation chocks located inside the void space usually just above the double <b>bottom</b> <b>tanks.</b> The tanks are normally divided by a centreline liquid-tight bulkhead; by this feature, together with the chamfered upperpart of the tank, the free liquid surface effect is reduced and thus the virtual rise of the Centre of gravity and the stability is increased. When these cargo tanks are designed to carry LPG (at −50 °C), the tank is constructed of fine-grained low-carbon manganese steel or even stainless steel as seen in the Maersk J class Ships. The hold space (void space) in this design is normally filled with dry inert gas or Nitrogen but may be ventilated with air during a ballast or gas free passage. The Conch design has been developed for carriage of LNG (at-163oC). The material for these cargo tanks has to be either 9% nickel steel or aluminium. The maximum allowable relief vapour setting (MARVS) is < 0. 7 bar.|$|R
40|$|Six Jet A fuels, {{with varying}} compositions, were tested for low {{temperature}} flowability in a 190 -liter simulator tank that modeled {{a section of}} a wing tank of a wide-body commercial airplane. The insulated tank was chilled by circulating coolant through {{the upper and lower}} surfaces. Flow-ability was determined as a function of fuel temperature by holdup, the fraction of unflowable fuel remaining in the tank after otherwise complete withdrawal. In static tests with subfreezing tank conditions, hold up varied with temperature and fuel composition. However, a general correlation of two or three classes of fuel type was obtained by plotting holdup {{as a function of the}} difference between freezing point and boundary-layer temperature, measured 0. 6 cm above the <b>bottom</b> <b>tank</b> surface. Dynamic conditions of vibrations and slosh or rate of fuel withdrawal had very minor effects on holdup. Tests with cooling schedules to represent extreme, cold-day flights showed, at most, slight holdup for any combination of fuel type or dynamic conditions. Tests that superimposed external fuel heating and recirculation during the cooldown period indicates reduced hold up by modification of the low-temperature boundary layer. Fuel heating was just as effective when initiated during the later times of the tests as when applied continuously...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{the shape of the}} vessel bottom and the length of baffles on the {{velocity}} distributions in a turbulent and in a transitional flow has been simulated. The turbulent flow was simulated using standard k-ε model and simulation was verified using LES whereas transitional flow was simulated using only LES. It has been found that both the shape of tank bottom and the baffles’ length has significant effect on the flow pattern and velocity distribution below the impeller. In the dished <b>bottom</b> <b>tank</b> with baffles reaching the edge of the dish, the large rotating volume of liquid was formed below the impeller. Liquid in this rotating region was not fully mixing. A dead zone was formed here. The size and the intensity of circulation within this zone calculated by k-ε model and LES were practically identical what reinforces the accuracy of the numerical simulations. Both types of simulations also show that employing full-length baffles can reduce the size of dead zone formed below the impeller. The LES was also used to simulate the velocity distribution below the impeller in transitional flow and it has been found that secondary circulation loops were formed near the tank bottom in all investigated geometries. However, in this case the length of baffles has smaller effect on the volume of rotating liquid than in the turbulent flow...|$|E
40|$|Numerical ocean {{models have}} become {{important}} in scientific studies of oceans, {{for the management}} of marine systems, and for industrial off-shore activities. It is therefore essential that the increasing amounts of model outputs are to be trusted. However, the development of quantitative methods for skill assessment of ocean models has proved to be very difficult. Exercises on comparisons of model results from different models and on comparisons of model results with observations often reveal significant differences. Most numerical studies of the oceanic flow are today performed with hydrostatic ocean models. With increasing spatial resolution the hydrostatic assumption becomes more questionable, and the interest in non-hydrostatic models for the ocean is increasing. In computational fluid dynamics there is a tradition for assessment of the models through comparisons with laboratory experiments. Non-hydrostatic ocean models may also be assessed using this approach. In the present paper a non-hydrostatic z-coordinate model and a non-hydrostatic σ-coordinate model are applied to study lock release gravity currents in a flat <b>bottom</b> <b>tank,</b> and the propagation and breaking of an internal solitary wave in a tank with a sloping bottom. The focus of the latter case is especially on model outputs showing the propagation and breaking of the solitary wave up an incline. The agreement between the results from the two models is generally very good, and front speeds and wave speeds are in good agreement with corresponding values from experimental data...|$|E

Tank 18 F slurry samples analyzed included the liquid and solid fractions derived from the 'as-received' slurry materials along with the floor scrape <b>bottom</b> <b>Tank</b> 18 F wet solids. These samples were taken from Tank 18 F in March 2009 and made available to SRNL in the same month. Because of limited amounts of solids observed in Tank 18 F samples, the samples from the north quadrants of the tank were combined into one North Tank 18 F Hemisphere sample and similarly the south quadrant samples were combined into one South Tank 18 F Hemisphere sample. These samples were delivered to the SRNL shielded cell. The Tank 18 F samples were analyzed for radiological, chemical and elemental components. Where analytical methods yielded additional contaminants other than those requested by the customer, these results were also reported. The target detection limits for isotopes analyzed were 1 E- 04 {micro}Ci/g for most radionuclides and customer desired detection values of 1 E- 05 {micro}Ci/g for I- 129, Pa- 231, Np- 237, and Ra- 226. While many of the minimum detection limits, as specified in the technical task request and task technical and quality assurance plans were met for the species characterized for Tank 18 F, some were not met due to spectral interferences.
