500|$|Kentuckys {{construction}} {{was plagued by}} suspensions. Her keel was laid down at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, on 7March 1942. However, work on the ship was suspended in June that year, and Kentuckys <b>bottom</b> <b>structure</b> was launched {{to make room for}} LST construction on 10 June. While her {{construction was}} suspended, the Bureau of Ships considered an aircraft carrier conversion proposal for Kentucky and Illinois {{in the aftermath of the}} Battles of Coral Sea and Midway. As proposed, the converted Kentucky would have had an [...] long by [...] wide flight deck, with armament identical to the carriers of the : four twin 5-inch gun mounts and four more 5-inch guns in single mounts, along with six 40mm quadruple mounts. The idea was abandoned after the Bureau of Ships decided that the converted ships would carry fewer aircraft than the Essex class, that more Essex-class carriers could be built in the same amount of time, and that the conversion project would be significantly more expensive than new Essexes. Instead, Kentucky and Illinois were to be completed as battleships, but their construction was given very low priority. Work on the ship resumed on 6December 1944, when the keel structure was returned to the slipway. Work on the battleship proceeded at a slow pace, and her completion was projected for the third quarter of 1946. In December 1945 it was recommended that Kentucky be completed as an anti-aircraft battleship, and work on the ship was suspended in August 1946 while this was considered. Construction resumed again on 17August 1948 without any decision having been made on her final design. Work on Kentucky continued until 20January 1950, when it was decided to halt work on the ship. Following this, she was floated out of her drydock to clear a space for repairs to sister ship , which had run aground en route from Hampton Roads.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy is {{performing}} {{research and development}} that focuses on key phenomena that are important during challenging scenarios that may occur in the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) /Generation IV very high temperature reactor (VHTR). Phenomena Identification and Ranking studies to date have identified the air ingress event, following {{on the heels of}} a VHTR depressurization, as very important. Consequently, the development of advanced air ingress-related models and verification & validation are of very high priority for the NGNP Project. Following a loss of coolant and system depressurization incident, air ingress will occur through the break, leading to oxidation of the in-core graphite structure and fuel. This study indicates that depending on the location and the size of the pipe break, the air ingress phenomena are different. In an effort to estimate the proper safety margin, experimental data and tools, including accurate multidimensional thermal-hydraulic and reactor physics models, a burn-off model, and a fracture model are required. It will also require effective strategies to mitigate the effects of oxidation, eventually. This 3 -year project (FY 2008 –FY 2010) is focused on various issues related to the VHTR air-ingress accident, including (a) analytical and experimental study of air ingress caused by density-driven, stratified, countercurrent flow, (b) advanced graphite oxidation experiments, (c) experimental study of burn-off in the core <b>bottom</b> <b>structures,</b> (d) structural tests of the oxidized core <b>bottom</b> <b>structures,</b> (e) implementation of advanced models developed during the previous tasks into the GAMMA code, (f) full air ingress and oxidation mitigation analyses, (g) development of core neutronic models, (h) coupling of the core neutronic and thermal hydraulic models, and (i) verification and validation of the coupled models...|$|R
