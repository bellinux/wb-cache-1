She contributed {{scores of}} 9.412 on vault, 9.762 on balance beam, and 9.750 on floor toward the Romanian team's first-place finish. In event finals, she won gold medals on balance beam (9.787) and floor (9.750). She called the results [...] "a dream that came true. ... When I {{won the gold}} medal on balance <b>beam,</b> <b>I</b> was very emotional. I had wished to win that medal forever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Practical anti-reflection coatings, however, rely on an {{intermediate}} layer {{not only for}} its direct reduction of reflection coefficient, but also use the interference effect of a thin layer. Assume the layer's thickness is controlled precisely, such that it is exactly one quarter of the wavelength of light in the layer ( [...] , where λ0 is the vacuum wavelength). The layer is then called a quarter-wave coating. For this type of coating a normally incident <b>beam</b> <b>I,</b> when reflected from the second interface, will travel exactly half its own wavelength further than the beam reflected from the first surface, leading to destructive interference. This is also true for thicker coating layers (3λ/4, 5λ/4, etc.), however the anti-reflective performance is worse in this case due to the stronger dependence of the reflectance on wavelength and the angle of incidence.|$|E

40|$|The {{writers have}} been {{studying}} the plastic deformations of steel <b>beams,</b> <b>i.</b> e. ductile materials, under large impulsive loading. At {{the same time we}} studied the theory and carried out some experiments on the response of wooden <b>beams,</b> <b>i.</b> e. brittle materials, under impulsive loading. When the wooden materials are fractured by impulse, whether the breaking stress in the breaking instant is the same value as the static breaking stress or not, is not yet declared. So we had experimental studies on the fractures of some kinds of wooden beams under impulsive loading and investigated the relations between static yielding stresses and dynamic ones. These details are described in this paper...|$|R
