5|$|English male {{murdered in}} an unprovoked racially {{motivated}} crime. He <b>bled</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> after being stabbed, beaten with a hammer, and repeatedly kicked by {{a gang of}} British Muslim youths. The incident occurred in Millfield, Peterborough, ten days after the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, {{there was an}} {{outbreak}} of a previously unrecognized cattle disease in the northern United States and Canada. Cattle were haemorrhaging after minor procedures and on some occasions, spontaneously. For example, 21 out of 22 cows died after dehorning and 12 out of 25 bulls died after castration. All of these animals had <b>bled</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{manslaughter}} {{charge was}} in March 1888, when Abby H. Corner, a practitioner in Medford, Massachusetts, attended {{to her daughter}} during childbirth; the daughter <b>bled</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> and the baby did not survive. The defense argued {{that they might have}} died even with medical attention, and Corner was acquitted. To the dismay of the Christian Scientists' Association (the secretary resigned), Eddy distanced herself from Corner, telling the Boston Globe that Corner had only attended the college for one term and had never entered the obstetrics class.|$|E

50|$|On 27 November 2000, Taylor set {{off from}} Peckham Library at 4:51 pm {{to make his}} way home. He was {{captured}} on CCTV as he walked away. On approaching the North Peckham Estate he received a gash to his left thigh. Running to a stairwell, he collapsed and <b>bled</b> <b>to</b> near <b>death</b> in the space of approximately 30 minutes. He was still alive in an ambulance on his way to hospital.|$|R
50|$|Rush's {{claim that}} his {{remedies}} cured 99 out of 100 patients have led historians and modern doctors to ridicule his remedies and approach to medical science. Some contemporaries also attacked him. The newspaper editor William Cobbett attacked Rush's therapies {{and called him}} a Sangrado, after a character in Gil Blas, who <b>bled</b> patients <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> In 1799 Rush won a $5,000 libel judgment against Cobbett.|$|R
5|$|Toms ran to {{a nearby}} petrol station for help and a man there gave her his mobile phone to call the police. While making the call, she twice heard Parker cry out in pain. By chance she spotted a passing police car. She entered the car and guided the officer {{to the scene of}} the assault. Although Toms had only been away for a few minutes, by the time she {{returned}} Parker had already <b>bled</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> and the gang had disappeared.|$|E
5|$|After a few skirmishes, the {{opposing}} forces met in earnest at Edgehill, on 23 October 1642. Charles's nephew Prince Rupert of the Rhine {{disagreed with the}} battle strategy of the royalist commander Lord Lindsey, and Charles sided with Rupert. Lindsey resigned, leaving Charles to assume overall command assisted by Lord Forth. Rupert's cavalry successfully charged through the parliamentary ranks, but instead of swiftly returning to the field, rode off to plunder the parliamentary baggage train. Lindsey, acting as a colonel, was wounded and <b>bled</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> without medical attention. The battle ended inconclusively as the daylight faded.|$|E
5|$|The boys ran to {{town for}} help, and several men, {{including}} local businessman Watson Stanley Fisher, 24, came to investigate. Fisher and others dived into the creek to find Stilwell, believing {{him to have}} suffered a seizure. After locating the boy's body and attempting to return to shore, Fisher was also bitten by the shark {{in front of the}} townspeople, losing Stilwell in the process. His right thigh was severely injured and he <b>bled</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> at Monmouth Memorial Hospital in Long Branch at 5:30p.m. Stilwell's body was recovered 150feet (46m) upstream from the Wyckoff dock on July 14.|$|E

Not the All Blacks, the French, or any of the Home Nations has ever shown anything like this." ...|$|R
50|$|She died on 16 October 1537, {{during the}} night, and {{assassination}} rumors quickly spread. According to them, Françoise {{would have been}} killed by her husband, jealous of her relationship with the King. According to some rumors, Jean de Laval would also have locked up is wife in a room, and later poisoned her or <b>bled</b> her <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Since then, every 16 October at midnight, a ghost procession would walk in the château. The Chambre dorée has often been presented as the place where Françoise died, but its present layout dates from only the 17th century.|$|R
5000|$|Almost {{all women}} in {{developing}} countries have at least four antenatal care visits, are attended to by a skilled health worker during childbirth, and receive postpartum care. In contrast, only 47% of Ugandan women receive antenatal care coverage and only 42% [...] of births are attended by skilled health personnel. Among the poorest 20% of the population, the share of births attended by skill health personnel was 29% in 2005/2006 as compared to 77% among the wealthiest 20% of the population. The case of Jennifer Anguko, a popular elected official who <b>bled</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>death</b> in the maternity ward in a major hospital, aptly exemplifies the poor state of maternal health care that is provided to women, even in major urban healthcare facilities.|$|R
5|$|Daun's {{battle plan}} took the Prussians {{completely}} by surprise. The {{east side of}} Frederick's line {{was the first to}} be attacked. Using the starless night and fog as cover, and grouped into small shock units for easier control and stealth, the Austrians fell on the Prussian battery when the church bell signaled 5:00, catching the Prussians completely off guard. Many men were still sleeping, or just waking up, when the attack started. After setting fire to the village, the Croats cut tent ropes, causing the canvas to fall on sleeping soldiers, then bayoneted the men as they struggled to free themselves from canvas and cords. Men tangled in the tents <b>bled</b> <b>to</b> <b>death,</b> in what today is still called Blutgasse, or Blood Alley.|$|E
5|$|Between July 1 and July 12, 1916, {{five people}} were {{attacked}} {{along the coast}} of New Jersey by sharks; only one of the victims survived. The first major attack occurred on Saturday, July 1 at Beach Haven, a resort town established on Long Beach Island off the southern coast of New Jersey. Charles Epting Vansant, 25, of Philadelphia was on vacation at the Engleside Hotel with his family. Before dinner, Vansant decided to take a quick swim in the Atlantic with a Chesapeake Bay Retriever that was playing on the beach. Shortly after entering the water, Vansant began shouting. Bathers believed he was calling to the dog, but a shark was actually biting Vansant's legs. He was rescued by lifeguard Alexander Ott and bystander Sheridan Taylor, who claimed the shark followed him to shore as they pulled the bleeding Vansant from the water. Vansant's left thigh was stripped of its flesh; he <b>bled</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> on the manager's desk of the Engleside Hotel at 6:45p.m.|$|E
5|$|The {{cases that}} were known in West Berlin {{provoked}} demonstrations among the population. Members of the Senate inspected the crime scenes {{and spoke to}} the press as well as public audiences. Various groups, and also individuals, launched protest campaigns against the Wall and the shootings. The fact that Peter Fechter <b>bled</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> in plain view of the public without anybody being able to help him lead to spontaneous mass demonstrations, which in turn resulted in riots in the following night. West Berlin policemen and US soldiers prevented a storming of the Wall. Buses bringing Soviet soldiers to the Tiergarten where they were to guard the Soviet War Memorial were pelted with stones by protesters. The incident also lead to anti-American protests, which were condemned by Willy Brandt. In the ensuing time, loudspeaker cars were sporadically set up at the Wall, urging the GDR border guards not to shoot at refugees and warning them of possible consequences. As a result of the shootings, West German groups lodged complaints with the UN Commission on Human Rights. The non-partisan Kuratorium Unteilbares Deutschland (Committee for an Indivisible Germany) sold protest placards and lapel pins in all of West Germany against the border regime and its consequences. Initially, West Berlin's regulatory authorities gave fugitives covering fire if they were being fired at by GDR border guards. This resulted in at least one lethal incident on 23 May 1962, when the border guard Peter Göring was shot dead by a West Berlin policeman while firing 44 times at a fleeing boy.|$|E
60|$|Marius {{continued}} his executions and massacres until {{the whole of}} Sylla's party had been slain or put to flight. He {{made every effort to}} discover Sylla's wife and child, with a view to destroying them also, but they could not be found. Some friends of Sylla, taking compassion on their innocence and helplessness, concealed them, and thus saved Marius from the commission of one intended crime. Marius was disappointed, too, in some other cases, where men whom he had intended to kill destroyed themselves to baffle his vengeance. One shut himself up in a room with burning charcoal, and was suffocated with the fumes. Another <b>bled</b> himself <b>to</b> <b>death</b> upon a public altar, calling down the judgments of the god to whom he offered this dreadful sacrifice, upon the head of the tyrant whose atrocious cruelty he was thus attempting to evade.|$|R

50|$|Guy-Crescent Fagon (11 May 1638 - 11 March 1718) was a {{physician}} and botanist. He came from nobility and his great uncle, Guy de La Brosse, had founded the Royal Gardens. Fagon {{was director of the}} gardens too. His significance in botany is reflected in the genus Fagonia being named after him. He also acted as the physician of Louis XIV of France. In 1669 he was made an honorary member of the French Academy of Sciences. He wrote about the health of the royal family. He lost his position as head physician after Louis XIV's death, which was somewhat customary after a king died, but he also received criticism for how he had dealt with the King's final illness. People thought his methods were proposterous, that he <b>bled</b> his patients <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> He was thought to have killed Young Duc de Bretagne and the beloved Marie Adelaide. Despite this he remained in charge of the Royal Garden until his death in 1718.|$|R

5000|$|From the Nobel Prize in Medicine {{acceptance}} speech given by Werner Forssmann in 1956: [...] "The credit {{for carrying out}} the first catheterization of {{the heart of a}} living animal for a definite experimental purpose is due to an English parson, the Reverend Stephen Hales. This scientifically interested layman undertook in Tordington (sic) in 1710, 53 years after the death of William Harvey(1578-1657), the first precise definition of the capacity of a heart. He <b>bled</b> a sheep <b>to</b> <b>death</b> and then led a gun-barrel from the neck vessels into the still-beating heart. Through this, he filled the hollow chambers with molten wax and then measured from the resultant cast the volume of the heartbeat and the minute-volume of the heart, which he calculated from the pulse-beat. Besides this, Stephen Hales was also the first, in 1727, to determine arterial blood pressure, when he measured the rise in a column of blood in a glass tube bound into an artery."

25|$|Adonis, {{who loved}} to hunt, was wounded by a wild boar, and <b>bled</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> in Aphrodite's arms. As she mourned his death, she caused anemones to grow {{wherever}} his blood fell, and declared a festival {{on the anniversary of}} his death. According to Lucian's De Dea Syria, the river Adonis in Lebanon ran red with blood. The myth of Aphrodite and Adonis is probably derived from the Near Eastern legend of Ishtar and Tammuz.|$|E
25|$|After {{the release}} of the film Reds (1981), the star and {{director}} of the picture, Warren Beatty apologized for his Spanish film crew's use of tripwires on horses while filming a battle scene, when Beatty wasn't present. Tripwires were used against horses when Rambo III (1988) and The 13th Warrior (1999) were being filmed. An ox was sliced nearly in half during production of Apocalypse Now (1979), while a donkey was <b>bled</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> for dramatic effect for the Danish film Manderlay (2005), in a scene later cut from the film.|$|E

All Cicaoan indigenous residents above 14 years of age were required to find and deliver a specific quota of gold every three months. Upon their doing so, they would receive copper tokens that they wore around their necks.

25|$|The two {{walked out}} of the library at 11:36a.m., ending the hostage {{situation}} there. Cautiously, fearing the shooters' return, 34 uninjured and 10 injured survivors began to evacuate the library through the north door, which led to the sidewalk adjacent to the west entrance. Kacey Ruegsegger was evacuated from the library by Craig Scott. Had she not been evacuated at this point, Ruegsegger would likely have <b>bled</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> from her injuries. Patrick Ireland, unconscious, and Lisa Kreutz, unable to move, remained in the building. Patti Nielson joined Brian Anderson and the three library staff in the exterior break room, into which Klebold had earlier fired shots.

25|$|On 17 August 1962, a teenaged East German, Peter Fechter, {{was shot}} in the pelvis by East German guards while trying to escape from East Berlin.

American {{soldiers}} could not rescue him because he was a few metres inside the Soviet sector. East German border guards were reluctant to approach him for fear of provoking Western soldiers, one of whom had shot an East German border guard just days earlier. More than an hour later, Fechter's body was removed by the East German guards. A spontaneous demonstration formed on the American side of the checkpoint, protesting the action of the East and the inaction of the West.|$|E

The treatment caused a prompt and sustained reversal of hypotension, with survival of all sham-operated animals, {{at least for}} the first 2 h, while in hepatectomized rats the {{arterial pressure}} increase was negligible and there was a 50 % mortality within 2 h after treatment. Moreover, the blood volume which could be drained from an arterial catheter prior <b>to</b> <b>death,</b> measured 15 - 20 min after ACTH injection, was 1. 51 +/- 0. 12 and 0. 64 +/- 0. 11 ml/ 100 g b. w. in sham-operated and hepatectomized rats, respectively. These results further support the idea that the effect of ACTH in haemorrhagic shock is due to the mobilization of blood pooled in peripheral reserve organs...|$|R
