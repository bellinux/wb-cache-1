One of the first individuals to develop recombinant DNA technology was a biochemist at Stanford {{by the name of}} Paul Berg. In his experimental design in 1974, he cleaved (cut into fragments) the monkey virus SV40. He then cleaved the double helix of another virus; an antibacterial agent known as <b>bacteriophage</b> <b>lambda.</b> In the third step, he fastened DNA from the SV40 to DNA from the <b>bacteriophage</b> <b>lambda.</b> The final step involved placing the mutant genetic material into a laboratory strain of the E. coli bacterium. This last step, however, was not completed in the original experiment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bacteriophage</b> <b>Lambda</b> binds to an E. coli cell {{by means}} of its J protein in the tail tip. The J protein interacts with the maltose outer {{membrane}} porin (the product of the lamB gene) of E. coli, a porin molecule, {{which is part of}} the maltose operon.|$|E
25|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made to map Protein–protein interactions among phage and their host. For instance, <b>bacteriophage</b> <b>lambda</b> was found to interact with its host E. coli by 31 interactions. However, a large-scale study revealed 62 interactions, most of which were new. Again, the significance of many of these interactions remains unclear, but these studies suggest that there are most likely several key interactions and many indirect interactions whose role remains uncharacterized.|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} the GroEL/GroES chaperone machine of Escherichia coli is absolutely essential, not only for bacterial growth but also for the propagation of many <b>bacteriophages</b> including <b>lambda.</b> The virulent <b>bacteriophages</b> T 4 and RB 49 are independent of the host GroES function, because they encode their own cochaperone proteins, Gp 31 and CocO, respectively. E. coli groEL 44 mutant bacteria do not form colonies above 42 degrees nor do they propagate <b>bacteriophages</b> <b>lambda,</b> T 4, or RB 49. We found that the vast majority (40 / 46) of spontaneous groEL 44 temperature-resistant colonies at 43 degrees were due to the presence of an intragenic suppressor mutation. These suppressors define 21 different amino acid substitutions in GroEL, each affecting one of 13 different amino acid residues. All of these amino acid residues are located at or near the hinge, which regulates the large en bloc movements of the GroEL apical domain. All of these intragenic suppressors support <b>bacteriophages</b> <b>lambda,</b> T 4, and RB 49 growth to various extents {{in the presence of the}} groEL 44 allele. Since it is known that the GroEL 44 mutant protein does not interact effectively with Gp 31, the suppressor mutations should enhance cochaperone binding. Analogous intragenic suppressor studies were conducted with the groEL 673 temperature-sensitive allele...|$|R

We have isolated a transducing derivative of lambda, called lambda gt-Ec. groE, that carries a functional copy of the groE gene. Unlike wild-type lambda, this phage is able to form plaques on hosts with a mutant groE gene. We have isolated an amber mutation in the groE gene carried by the phage, and this has made it possible to identify the groE product as a protein of molecular weight 65, 000.

In addition, the Abc function of P 22, but not the Gam function of lambda, was found to inhibit recombination in a wild-type host; however, both Abc and Gam inhibited recombination in a recF mutant host.

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is shown that {{conformation}} and packing of double-stranded DNA within {{the head of}} <b>bacteriophages</b> <b>lambda</b> and T 4 can be assessed by cryo-electron microscopy of vitrified specimens. Electron diffraction patterns show that DNA within vitrified bacteriophages has a B conformation. Electron micrographs of vitrified bacteriophages show domains within the head formed by a approximately 2. 5 -nm striation and arising from the DNA packing. The number of differently oriented domains seen within a vitrified bacteriophage depends upon the geometry of the DNA container: the bacteriophage capsid. The packing of DNA within bacteriophages seems then to be governed by at least two phenomena. The first is the tendency of DNA to form local alignments (nematic liquid crystals). The second is the orientation of these liquid crystals by the bacteriophage capsid. From these observations we propose a possible packaging mechanism: constrained nematic crystallization...|$|R

However, viral genomics continues to suffer due to difficulties {{related to the}} isolation and characterization of uncultivated viruses. We report here on a new approach called ‘Single Virus Genomics’, which enabled the isolation and complete genome sequencing of the first single virus particle. A mixed assemblage comprised of two known viruses; E. coli <b>bacteriophages</b> <b>lambda</b> and T 4, were sorted using flow cytometric methods and subsequently immobilized in an agarose matrix. Genome amplification was then achieved in situ via multiple displacement amplification (MDA). The complete lambda phage genome was recovered with an average depth of coverage of approximately 437 X.

40|$|A pragmatic {{method to}} deposit silver {{nanoparticles}} on polydopamine-coated nanoimprinted pillars {{for use as}} surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates was developed. Pillar arrays consisting of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) that ranged in diameter from 300 to 500 nm were fabricated using nanoimprint lithography. The arrays had periodicities from 0. 6 to 4. 0 mu m. A polydopamine layer was coated on the pillars {{in order to facilitate}} the reduction of silver ions to create silver nucleation sites during the electroless deposition of sliver nanoparticles. The size and density of silver nanoparticles were controlled by adjusting the growth time for the optimization of the SERS performance. The size of the surface-adhered nanoparticles ranged between 75 and 175 nm, and the average particle density was similar to 30 particles per mu m(2). These functionalized arrays had a high sensitivity and excellent signal reproducibility for the SERS-based detection of 4 -methoxybenzoic acid.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{efficiently}} and reliably transfer genetic circuits between the key synthetic biology chassis, such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, constitutes {{one of the}} major hurdles of the rational genome engineering. Using lambda Red recombineering we integrated the thermosensitive lambda repressor and the lysis genes of several bacteriophages into the E. coli chromosome. The lysis of the engineered autolytic cells is inducible by a simple temperature shift. We improved the lysis efficiency by introducing different combinations of lysis genes from <b>bacteriophages</b> <b>lambda,</b> ΦX 174 and MS 2 {{under the control of the}} thermosensitive lambda repressor into the E. coli chromosome.
