She made her WWF television debut on the June 14, 2001 episode of SmackDown! when then-face, Shane McMahon <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring to distract then-heel, Rhyno, causing him to lose a match. Keibler originally teamed up with real-life friend, then-heel, Torrie Wilson, and the pair feuded with Trish Stratus and Lita.

The buildings were constructed by Giovanni Giliardi. The original estate was very large; the modern Khrenovsky stud area is fifteen times smaller than it was prior to the Bolshevik revolution.|$|E

25|$|The Bluest Eye was {{published}} in 1970 when Morrison was thirty-nine. It did not sell well at first, but the City University of New York put the novel on its reading list for its new black-studies department, as did other colleges, which boosted sales. The book also <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of the acclaimed editor Robert Gottlieb at Knopf, an imprint of Random House. Gottlieb {{would go on to}} edit most of Morrison's novels.|$|E
25|$|Dickinson {{entered a}} beauty pageant in 1953 and placed second. The {{exposure}} <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{attention of a}} television industry producer, who asked her to consider a career in acting. She studied the craft {{and a few years}} later was approached by NBC to guest-star on a number of variety shows, including The Colgate Comedy Hour. She soon met Frank Sinatra, who became a lifelong friend. She later was cast as Sinatra's wife in the film Ocean's 11.|$|E
25|$|Joann {{is able to}} {{complete}} the one {{piece of the puzzle}} that Frank could not: revealing what happened to the band's second album. After storming from the studio, Eddie <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Palace of Depression, a makeshift castle made of garbage and junk that he visited often as a child. She reveals it was in fact she who took the master tapes for the album from Satin Records, hiding them in the Palace of Depression, where she felt they belonged.|$|E

25|$|Goodall {{had always}} been passionate about animals and Africa, which <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> farm of {{a friend in the}} Kenya {{highlands}} in 1957. From there, she obtained work as a secretary, and acting on her friend's advice, she telephoned Louis Leakey, the notable Kenyan archaeologist and palaeontologist, with no other thought than to make an appointment to discuss animals. Leakey, believing that the study of existing great apes could provide indications of the behaviour of early hominids, was looking for a chimpanzee researcher, though he kept the idea to himself. Instead, he proposed that Goodall work for him as a secretary. After obtaining his wife Mary Leakey's approval, Louis sent Goodall to Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, where he laid out his plans.|$|E
25|$|Zakharov {{was born}} Alice Olive Hay, in Kew, Melbourne. She studied {{psychology}} {{as part of}} an arts degree at Melbourne University, where she joined the local branch of the Communist Party of Australia, something which she later discovered had <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. She briefly married while at university, but the couple separated in 1949, and she soon moved to Yallourn to live with a new partner, unionist John Zakharov, who she later married and began a family with. As a young woman, she juggled her family commitments with a number of jobs, working as a market research interviewer, clerk, waitress, mail officer, psychiatric nurse, and pathology assistant. She also continued to be politically active, being involved in the local branch of the Australian Labor Party.|$|E
25|$|The {{publicity}} surrounding automobile journey <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{attention of}} Jerome Fanciulli and Glenn Curtiss {{who agreed to}} provide her with flying lessons in Hammondsport, New York. She {{was the only woman}} to receive instruction directly from Curtiss. He fitted a limiter on the throttle of Scott's airplane to prevent it gaining enough speed to become airborne while she practiced taxiing on her own. On September 6 either the limiter moved or a gust of wind lifted the biplane and she flew to an altitude of forty feet before executing a gentle landing. Her flight was short and possibly unintentional but Scott is credited by the Early Birds of Aviation as the first woman to pilot and solo in an airplane in the United States, although Bessica Medlar Raiche's flight on September 16 was accredited as first by the Aeronautical Society of America at the time.|$|E

25|$|Blanka Vlašić {{was born}} on 8 November 1983 in Split, Croatia (which was then part of Yugoslavia). From a young age, she was {{involved}} in sports: her mother Venera was a seasoned amateur in basketball and cross country skiing while her father, Joško Vlašić, was an international athlete who broke the Croatian record in the decathlon. Her father <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> track while he practised and she dreamed of becoming a professional sprinter. As she grew up she tried a number of sports but found that the high jump was particularly well-suited to her tall and slender frame. Vlašić shunned the idea of competing in more profitable sports, such as basketball, saying that she preferred the thrill of individual sports. She reached the international standard for a high jumper at an early age, setting a personal best of 1.80metres at fifteen years of age and quickly improving to 1.93m at sixteen.|$|E
25|$|Aubrey meets Admiral Ives, now in Gibraltar, who {{is pleased}} with the last mission of HMS Surprise, despite Aubrey's {{negative}} report. Mr Yarrow will rephrase it to make the success clearer to the Admiralty. The admiral is now a peer, his deepest wish, {{and he is a}} happy man. Aubrey dines with Laura Fielding and her husband, Lieutenant Fielding, who is now satisfied that his wife is true to him and thanks Aubrey for bringing her from Malta to Gibraltar (though it is Maturin who <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ship, saving her from two assassins). Maturin receives news from his intelligence-chief in London, Sir Joseph Blaine, confirming high level infiltration of British intelligence by the French.

Maturin learns of his success in Malta, destroying the French intelligence network based there, all but André Lesueur taken.|$|E
25|$|At {{that stage}} in her life, Lívia Rusz began collaborating with {{specialized}} magazines for children. With time, {{her work in}} the comics genre came {{to be influenced by}} Jean Cézard, French creator of Arthur le fantôme justicier for Pif gadget, {{and one of the few}} foreign cartoonists to be known in Romania. The first local publication to employ Rusz was the Hungarian-language Napsugár, where she first met writer Sándor Fodor, with whom she collaborated on the cycle of books Csipike (known as Piticul Cipi in Romanian). This contribution <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of Lucia Olteanu, editor of Luminiţa, a Bucharest-based and Romanian-language periodical. Rusz accepted the offer for collaboration, and, with Olteanu, created the comic strips Răţoiul Mac ("Mac the Duck"; Hungarian: Mákvirág) and Cocofifi (or Kokó). These earned Rusz a large following among the young public, and she also began collaborating with the youth journals Arici Pogonici and Cutezătorii. Her other projects in comics included a rendition of L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, as well as the comic strips Maimuţa Kio ("Kio the Monkey", with a text by Ovidiu Zotta), redrawings of the Mac and Cocofifi originals, and Dan Buzdugan ("Dan the Mace", a medieval fantasy series, distinguished among her contributions for its more realistic visual style).|$|E

Robin, Regina and Zelena catch up with Belle and return the baby to Zelena so she can feed her. However, Zelena was about deceive {{everyone}} by escaping with her daughter, only to have a change of heart and returning her baby, upon learning that her magic isn’t powerful enough in the Underworld to protect the baby by herself, having suspected that Hades <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Underworld so that he can use her daughter to enact a time-travel spell. Meanwhile at the loft, everyone starts to believe that Zelena, even without her powers, can help them. Henry also shows them more drawings, including the story of baby Neal hearing his parents, indicating that Snow and David succeeded in getting the message to their son.|$|E
25|$|Socialist historians in the 20th century revived {{interest}} in the Levellers and the popular historian and journalist H. N. Brailsford mentioned both Katherine and Samuel Chidley several times in his book on the subject, written in the 1950s. Ian Gentles contributed an important article on the Chidleys to The Journal of Ecclesiastical History in 1978, going on the write the article on Katharine for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography in 2004. By this time, she was becoming an important subject for Feminist historians. Katharine Gillespie of Miami University, who has sought to give serious weight to Biblical and theological perspectives, edited a facsimile edition of her writings, published in 2009. Interest {{is not confined to}} the Left: Chidley's centrality in discussion of the separation of Church and State has <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of the Online Library of Liberty, sponsored by the Right Libertarian Liberty Fund, which {{is in the process of}} publishing her main works online. The Justification and A New-Yeares-Gift have been made available for free by the Text Creation Partnership in searchable and paginated online versions. As a result of the widespread interest, Chidley is now mentioned in general histories of the 17th century. A notable example, is episode 9 of Simon Schama's BBC History of Britain (at 12:30 minutes into the episode), and the supporting book, which gives consideration to Chidley and Leveller women more generally.|$|E
500|$|Duffy's {{range of}} musical genres {{incorporates}} styles such as blue-eyed soul, pop and pop rock. Aimée Duffy, her debut extended play (EP), {{was released in}} 2004 by Welsh music label Recordiau Awen Records, following her success on the Welsh talent show WawFfactor in 2003.

He lived in Weissenburg and, soon after, married Sylvia Welter. He <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States in April 1946, but the {{marriage}} fell apart after eight months and Sylvia returned to Germany. In 1972, Salinger's daughter Margaret was with him when he received a letter from Sylvia. He looked at the envelope, and without reading it, tore it apart. It {{was the first time he}} had heard from her since the breakup, but as Margaret put it, [...] "when he was finished with a person, he was through with them." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the king}} withdrew, the exultant crowd {{would not be}} denied the same accord from the queen, and her {{presence}} was demanded loudly. Lafayette <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same balcony, accompanied by her young son and daughter. The crowd ominously shouted {{for the children to}} be taken away, and it seemed the stage might be set for a regicide. Yet, as the queen stood with her hands crossed over her chest, the crowd – some of whom had muskets leveled in her direction – warmed to her courage. Amid this unlikely development, Lafayette cannily let the mob's fury drain away until, with dramatic timing and flair, he knelt reverently and kissed her hand. The demonstrators responded with a muted respect, and many even raised a cheer which the queen had not heard for quite a long time: [...] "Vive la Reine!" ...|$|E

Prospero further relates that many years earlier, sailors had <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island, while {{she was pregnant with}} her bestial son, Caliban, and abandoned her there, as by some ambiguous reason, she was spared being put to death. She proceeded to enslave the spirits there, chief among them Ariel, whom she eventually imprisoned in a pine tree for disobedience. Sycorax birthed Caliban and taught him to worship the demonic god Setebos. She dies long before the arrival of Prospero and his daughter, Miranda. Caliban grows to hate Prospero's presence and power on the island, claiming that the land belongs to him since it was his mother's before Prospero appeared.|$|E
