50|$|Bisphosphonates {{primarily}} reduce osteoclastic activity, {{which prevents}} bone resorption, and thus moves the bone resorption/formation equilibrium toward the formation side and hence makes bone stronger {{on the long}} run. Etidronate, unlike other bisphosphonates, also prevents <b>bone</b> <b>calcification.</b> For this reason, other bisphosphonates, like alendronate, are preferred when fighting osteoporosis. To prevent bone resorption without affecting too much <b>bone</b> <b>calcification,</b> etidronate must be administered only {{for a short time}} once in a while, for example for two weeks every 3 months. When given on a continuous basis, say every day, etidronate will altogether prevent <b>bone</b> <b>calcification.</b> This effect may be useful and etidronate is in fact used this way to fight heterotopic ossification. But in the long run, if used on a continuous basis, it will cause osteomalacia.|$|E

In conventional CT of a composite object only the cumulative contribution of all involved materials to the attenuation is measurable, but not how much each material component contributes to this attenuation is measured. Therefore, contrast agent cannot be distinguished from <b>bone</b> or <b>calcifications.</b> The method of material reconstruction exploits the energy information to determine the partial densities of the involved materials using a maximum likelihood approach, i. e. it allows the separation of contrast agent from tissue, <b>bones</b> and <b>calcifications.</b> We have employed the Medipix All Resolution System (MARS) scanner equipped with a Medipix 2 MXR and performed a CT scan of a mouse with iodine contrast agent in stomach and bowel. The method allows to separate the iodine contrast agent {{from all the other}} absorbing structures.

40|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) is a modality {{of choice}} {{for the study of}} the musculoskeletal system for various indications including the study of <b>bone,</b> <b>calcifications,</b> internal derangements of joints (with CT arthrography), as well as periprosthetic complications. However, CT remains intrinsically limited by the fact that it exposes patients to ionizing radiation. Scanning protocols need to be optimized to achieve diagnostic image quality at the lowest radiation dose possible. In this optimization process, the radiologist needs to be familiar with the parameters used to quantify radiation dose and image quality. CT imaging of the musculoskeletal system has certain specificities including the focus on high-contrast objects (i. e., in CT of bone or CT arthrography). These characteristics need to be taken into account when defining a strategy to optimize dose and when choosing the best combination of scanning parameters. In the first part of this review, we present the parameters used for the evaluation and quantification of radiation dose and image quality. In the second part, we discuss different strategies to optimize radiation dose and image quality at CT, with a focus on the musculoskeletal system and the use of novel iterative reconstruction techniques...|$|R

40|$|Background: Ectopic {{vascular}} calcifications {{represent a}} major clinical problem associated with cardiovascular disease and mortality. However, the mechanisms underlying pathological vascular calcifications are largely unknown hampering {{the development of}} therapies to tackle this life threatening medical condition. Results: In order to gain insight into the genes and mechanisms driving this pathological calcification process we analyzed the transcriptional profile of calcifying vascular smooth muscle cells (C-VSMCs). These profiles were compared to differentiating osteoblasts, cells that constitute their physiological calcification counterparts in the body. Overall the transcriptional program of C-VSMC and osteoblasts did not overlap. Several genes, some of them relevant for bone formation, were distinctly modulated by C-VSMCs which did not necessarily lose their smooth muscle cell markers while calcifying. Bioinformatics gene clustering and correlation analysis disclosed limited bone-related mechanisms being shared by two cell types. Extracellular matrix (ECM) and biomineralization genes represented common denominators between pathological vascular and physiological <b>bone</b> <b>calcifications.</b> These genes constitute the strongest link between these cells and represent potential drivers for their shared end-point phenotype. Conclusions: The analyses {{support the hypothesis that}} VSMC trans-differentiate into C-VSMCs keeping their own identity while using mechanisms that osteoblasts use to mineralize. The data provide novel insights into groups of genes and biological processes shared in MSC and VSMC osteogenic differentiation. The distinct gene regulation between C-VSMC and osteoblasts might hold clues to find cell-specific pathway modulations, opening the possibility to tackle undesired vascular calcifications without disturbing physiologic bone formation and vice versa...|$|R
50|$|Ochronosis {{occurs because}} of {{deposition}} of phenols (such as homogentisic acid and hydroquinone) as plaques in the matrix of cartilage. The pigments {{can also be}} incorporated into collagen and elastin fibers. In the skin, the pigment alters {{the structure of the}} fibers causing enlargement and curling.The embedded pigments also form cross-linkages with pigment depositions in adjacent fibers, stabilizing and reducing the elastic recoil of the fibers. This results in hardening of elastic structures increasing their rigidity and brittleness. Once ruptured, the exposed pigments cause a foreign body reaction and inflammation. This pigment deposition also invokes deposition of hydroxyapatite, the mineral responsible for <b>bone</b> <b>calcification,</b> further hardening the connective tissue.The pigment can also be excreted by glandular cells in apocrine and ceruminous sweat glands as well as breast and prostate tissue. This results in darkly pigmented sweat and breast milk. Excretion of the pigment is only found in endogenous ochronosis and should not occur from topical phenols.|$|E

40|$|Summary: β-Cryptoxanthin {{displays}} a unique anabolic effect on <b>bone</b> <b>calcification.</b> In women with osteoporosis, serum β-cryptoxanthin and 25 -OH-vitamin D 3 showed a weak but significant correlation and exhibited a complementary seasonal distribution. The potential role of β-cryptoxanthin as a nutritional approach to improving bone health deserves further evaluation. Introduction: Dietary intake and serum levels of β-cryptoxanthin have been {{inversely related to}} different bone and joint disorders and in vitro and animal {{studies have shown that}} β-cryptoxanthin {{displays a}} unique anabolic effect on <b>bone</b> <b>calcification.</b> Due to the emerging role of β-cryptoxanthin in bone biology, we aimed to assess the serum distribution and variability of β-cryptoxanthin and their potential relation to 25 -OH-vitamin D 3 in women with osteoporosis. Methods: Serum concentrations of α- and β-cryptoxanthin and 25 -OH- D 3 in women with osteoporosis (N= 644) were analyzed using a quality-controlled high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Results: Overall, significant seasonal variations were found for the three analytes and inter-individual variation was also high (60 - 73 %). β-cryptoxanthin and 25 -OH-vitamin D 3 exhibited a marked complementary seasonal distribution in serum, with vitamin D displaying the highest values in summer and β-cryptoxanthin in winter. Conclusions: Given the anabolic effect of β-cryptoxanthin on <b>bone</b> <b>calcification</b> and its complementary seasonal distribution with respect to 25 -OH-vitamin D 3, the potential role of β-cryptoxanthin as a sustainable nutritional approach to improving bone health deserves to be further evaluated. © 2007 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation. β-Cryptoxanthin.

40|$|In {{patients}} with progressive {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD), the homeostatic mechanisms regulating calcium and phosphate metabolism suffer important changes resulting in low serum levels of calcitriol and calcium and phosphorous retention. The regulatory mechanisms fail and several chronic kidney disease mineral bone disorders (CKD-MBD) occur, including <b>bone</b> disease, vascular <b>calcifications,</b> cardiovascular disorders, <b>bone</b> fragility fractures and reduced survival. Vascular <b>calcification,</b> <b>bone</b> loss and increased fracture risk are severe disorders associated with ageing in chronic CKD, but also generally speaking. Several epidemiological studies have shown the relationship between impaired <b>bone</b> metabolism, vascular <b>calcification</b> and increased mortality. Recent data suggest this association may be not just a consequence of ageing; the common occurrence of severe cases of vascular calcifications together with low bone activity and osteoporosis suggests {{there might be some}} direct biological links between the bone and the vascular systems. New challenging experimental data suggest that once the severe vascular calcification appears, vessels may develop a mechanism to diminish the vascular mineralization in the artery wall, this defensive mechanism may have a negative impact favouring the reduction of bone mass.

40|$|AbstractChronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is {{associated}} with a multifactorial dysregulation of <b>bone</b> and vascular <b>calcification</b> and closely linked to increased cardiovascular mortality and concomitant bone disease. We aimed to investigate specific microRNA (miRNA) signatures in CKD patients to find indicators for vascular <b>calcification</b> and/or <b>bone</b> mineralization changes during CKD and after kidney transplantation (KT). A miRNA array was used to investigate serum miRNA profiles in CKD patients, then selected miRNAs were quantified in a validation cohort comprising 73 patients in CKD stages 3 to 5, 67 CKD patients after KT, and 36 healthy controls. A spectrum of biochemical parameters including markers for kidney function, inflammation, glucose, and mineral metabolism was determined. The relative expression of miR- 223 - 3 p and miR- 93 - 5 p was down-regulated in patients with CKD stage 4 and 5 compared to healthy controls. This down-regulation disappeared after kidney transplantation even when lower glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) persisted. MiR- 223 - 3 p and miR- 93 - 5 p were associated with interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and eGFR levels, and by trend with interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), C-peptide, hematocrit, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). This study contributes new knowledge of serum miRNA expression profiles in CKD, potentially reflecting pathophysiological changes of <b>bone</b> and <b>calcification</b> pathways associated with inflammation, vascular calcification, mineral and glucose metabolism.

40|$|Introduction The ever {{expanding}} {{gamut of}} medical imaging techniques provides the clinician an increasingly multifaceted view of brain function and anatomy. The {{information provided by}} the various imaging modalities is often complementary (i. e. provides separate but useful information) and synergistic (i. e. the combination of information provides useful extra information). For example, X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging exquisitely demonstrate brain anatomy but provide little functional information. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans display aspects of brain function and allow metabolic measurements but poorly delineate anatomy.
