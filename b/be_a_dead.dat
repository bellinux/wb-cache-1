5|$|The race ended after Paul di Resta {{crashed on}} the start/finish {{straight}} {{shortly before the}} end, bringing out the safety car once again until {{the conclusion of the}} race. Caterham's Vitaly Petrov took 11th position which meant his team overtook Marussia in the Constructors' Championship. Former world champion Kimi Räikkönen had an eventful race as well, almost crashing into Vettel after the start and later trying to use an escape road only to find it to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> end. He later stated the way had been open 11 years prior, having made the same manoeuver at the 2001 race. He also had a close contest with the retiring Michael Schumacher, who finished seventh after recovering from an early puncture, but gave up sixth to Vettel in order to help him extend his small point advantage over Fernando Alonso in the championship.|$|E
25|$|Death feigning {{may also}} play a role in reproduction, For example, in the nursery web spider, the male {{sometimes}} feigns death to avoid getting eaten by females during mating. In some cases, death feigning is used by a predator. For example, the predatory cichlid Haplochromis livingstoni lies on its side on the bottom sediments until approached by scavengers attracted to what appears to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> fish, whereupon H. livingstoni abandons the pretence, rights itself and attacks the scavenger.|$|E

25|$|Limnoithona tetraspina {{has become}} the numerically {{dominant}} cyclopoid copepod since its introduction in 1993. It feeds primarily upon ciliates and microflagellates, but unlike P. forbesi, it is relatively impervious to predation by clams or fish, hence its abundance. Energetically, L. tetraspina may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> end for the food web; these copepods are either advected {{out of the system}} by tides and currents, or die and fall down to the benthos, where they may be available to the microbial loop, or to detritivores.|$|E
25|$|When Atomica (a Secret Society spy {{and member}} of the Crime Syndicate) manipulates Superman into murdering Doctor Light by {{triggering}} his heat vision power by stabbing his brain with a sliver of Kryptonite, Question breaks into the facility where Superman is being held. Using a gas mask-based setup similar to the one used by Nemesis, Question impersonates Steve Trevor and frees Superman, while presenting a lead towards who caused Superman to kill Doctor Light. The lead turns out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> end, but it places Question in with the various Justice League factions when Pandora attempts to seek their help to open the skull-shaped box that various forces are coveting.|$|E
25|$|Although Cappadocian Greek {{was once}} {{believed}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> language, {{the discovery of}} a population of speakers has led to an increase in awareness, both within and outside of the Cappadocian community in Greece. In the documentary “Last Words,” which follows Mark Janse through Cappadocian-speaking villages on the Greek mainland, community members are seen encouraging each other to use their dialect for ordinary things, such as joke telling. The members of these villages, including such notable figures as the bishop, recount being touched by a presentation given in Cappadocian by Janse on a visit to the region. The bishop {{went so far as to}} say that Janse’s speech “has lifted their shame.” The revitalisation process is seen through examples such as this, wherein the speakers have begun to take back their identity and embrace their mother tongue. Additionally, younger generations are embracing the power of technology to spread awareness, utilising social media about the language to inform the larger Greek population.|$|E

During the family introduction, Sam explains that, as mentioned in Cheers, Frasier's father was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> scientist and that Frasier {{is supposed to be the}} only child, much to dismay of Frasier's family.

Up to 2,400 tourists per day arrived {{in the area in}} the two weeks after the volcano started erupting on December 14, filling local hotels, compared to a more modest average of 200 in the days prior.

2500|$|Some {{consider}} the Éole {{to have been}} the first true aeroplane, given that it left the ground under its own power and carried a person through the air for a short distance, and that the event of 8 October 1890 was the first successful flight. However, the lack of directional control, and the fact that steam-powered aircraft proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> end, both weigh against these claims. [...] Ader's proponents have claimed that the Wrights' early airplanes required a catapult to take off; however, the Wrights did not use a catapult for their first flights in 1903, though they did for many flights in 1904 and later.|$|E

Hook walks Emma home and at the door to the loft they share a kiss after Emma jokingly invites him in for coffee with her parents. During the kiss Hook notices his left hand again acting aggressively. Emma walks inside and has a moment when she seems to realize Hook's hand's actions and has a brief conversation with her parents. Hook runs into a drunk Will Scarlet trying to break into the library and punches him in the face when Will refuses to stop. Hook again is put off by his hand controlling his actions and tells Will that if he informs anyone of what happened he will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> man. As Mr. Gold is preparing to go home in his car with flowers Hook enters the passenger door and tells Mr. Gold to replace his hand with the hook. He refuses, saying Hook should've heeded his warnings. Hook threatens to inform Belle (Emilie de Ravin) of the dagger, but Gold then tells Hook that he has swapped the daggers and that Belle has the actual dagger. Mr. Gold says he will replace the Hook once Hook does a favor for him. He refuses to give Hook a definite date or time and Hook states he {{can find a way to}} remove it without magic. Mr. Gold tells Hook that since his magic restored the hand, only his magic can take it off. Enraged, Hook thrusts the hook into Gold's chest. Mr. Gold is unharmed, stating he would have thought Hook would have learned the first time he tried to kill Rumplestiltskin. Hook states that it wasn't him that did that, and Mr. Gold states that the next time he may harm someone else who he cares about. Hook states he will do whatever it takes and Mr. Gold says that he loves it when people say that. He tells Hook to meet him on the docks in the morning.|$|E
