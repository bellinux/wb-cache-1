Already in the dense vegetation, 2 Platoon—under Second Lieutenant Graham Ackland—had only advanced 150metres when a sniper was spotted in a tree and was subsequently shot by the platoon sergeant. Almost simultaneously, 3 Platoon was engaged with small arms fire, while behind them the company headquarters was engaged by more snipers. 2 Platoon assaulted straight into the main Viet Cong position with grenades and machine-guns. <b>Breaking-in</b> they moved forward, killing a number of Viet Cong in their weapon pits but suffering six casualties in less than a minute, with a third of the lead platoon falling wounded in the initial volleys. Pinned down and in trouble, Ackland realised that he was facing a sizable and well dug-in force and he attempted to move his sections into an all-round defensive perimeter in order to defend against any counter-attack; the Viet Cong did not attack however and instead remained in their pits. In an attempt to relieve 2 Platoon, O'Brien manoeuvred 1 and 3 Platoons, while requesting B Company support his right flank as soon as they arrived at the landing zone.|$|E

He considered the alternatives {{based on that}} the railway would be extended to Kirkenes, that the railway should be built as quickly as possible, and considering the line's strategic location. Of military-strategic concerns, he discarded the proposals which involved a ferry.

2500|$|In his after action report Lieutenant Colonel Colin Townsend—Commanding Officer 6 RAR—wrote that he {{believed}} D Company had disrupted a regimental attack on the 1 ATF base. Yet years later he stated that he doubted the Viet Cong ever intended attacking Nui Dat. He felt they would have gained more from attacking a soft target such as Ba Ria and that the defences at Nui Dat would have been sufficient to withstand a regimental assault, having been improved significantly in the 11 weeks since its occupation and protected by patrols and overwhelming artillery support, {{even if they were}} still to be fully developed. However, there were suspicions a battalion from the 274th Regiment was moving towards Nui Dat from the west {{at the same time the}} 275th Regiment approached from the east, and if true such an attack may have been feasible, even if it still would not have achieved the nine to one superiority communist doctrine required. The southern side of the base was only lightly defended and an assault from that direction would have allowed the Viet Cong to attack the gunline first, and if they succeeded in <b>breaking-in</b> would have then crossed [...] of open ground before reaching Headquarters 1 ATF. On the other hand, Major Noel Ford—Officer Commanding B Company, 6 RAR—believed the mortar attack served to lure an Australian reaction force into an ambush, arguing the Viet Cong would have been unlikely to telegraph their intentions to attack Nui Dat and that they had left a clear trail for any force dispatched to find the mortar base plate and RCL positions. Townsend disagreed, arguing the mortar crews and RCL teams had actually tried to hamper the follow up by breaking into small groups, indicating that no such trap had been planned. Meanwhile, Major Harry Honnor—Officer Commanding the 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery attached to 6 RAR in direct support—believed the bombardment had been used by the Viet Cong to register targets and that D Company had stumbled across the force as it was preparing to launch an assault on Nui Dat two days later, with the battle that ensued preventing this from occurring.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Pilkington fluttered agitatedly. This was {{his first}} {{experience}} of Mr. Goble in the capacity of stage-director. It was the latter's custom to leave the early rehearsals of the pieces with which he was connected to a subordinate producer, who did what Mr. Goble called the <b>breaking-in.</b> This accomplished, he would appear in person, undo most of the other's work, make cuts, tell the actors how to read their lines, and generally enjoy himself.

She had perfect health, abounding spirits. She was so active hat she had to train herself into taking the midday siesta, a custom of the country and imperative during the hot summer months. Sometimes she looked in her mirror and laughed with sheer joy at sight of the lithe, audacious, brown-faced, flashing-eyed creature reflected there. It was not so much joy in her beauty as sheer joy of life. Eastern critics had been wont to call her beautiful in those days when she had been pale and slender and proud and cold. She laughed. If they could only see her now! From the tip of her golden head to her feet she was alive, pulsating, on fire.|$|E
6000|$|While I was inditing the goodly {{matter which}} my readers have just perused, I {{might be said}} {{to go through a}} course of <b>breaking-in</b> to stand criticism, like a shooting-pony to stand fire. By some of those venial {{breaches}} of confidence, which always take place on the like occasions, my private flirtations with the Muse of Fiction became a matter whispered in Miss Fairscribe's circle, some ornaments of which were, I suppose, highly interested in the progress of the affair, while others [...] "really thought Mr. Chrystal Croftangry might have had more wit at his time of day."

He learned to shiver {{for an hour and a}} quarter on the windward side of Elysium while Mrs. Reiver was making up her mind to come for a ride. He learned to hunt for a 'rickshaw, in a light dress-suit under a pelting rain, and to walk by the side of that 'rickshaw when he had found it. He learned what it was to be spoken to like a coolie and ordered about like a cook. He learned all this and many other things besides. And he paid for his schooling.|$|E
60|$|To train an Ox {{to carry}} a Rider.--It takes {{a very long time}} to train an ox {{to carry a}} riding-saddle well and steadily: indeed, very few oxen can be taught to go {{wherever}} they may be guided by the rider; they are of so gregarious a nature, that, for the most part, they will not move a step without companions. Hence, those oxen only are thought worth <b>breaking-in</b> which are observed to take the part of leaders of the drove when pasturing, and which are therefore supposed to have some independence of disposition. The first time of mounting an ox to break him in, is a work of almost certain mischance: for the long horns of the ox will often reach the rider, however far back he may sit, and the animal kicks and bucks in a way that severely tries the best of seats. All riding-oxen's horns should have the tips sawn off. After being mounted a very few times, the ox goes pretty steadily; but it is long before he learns to carry a rider with ease to himself. I should like to hear if Rarey's plan of tying up the foreleg would influence them. Their character is so wholly unlike that of a horse, that I doubt if it would.|$|E
6000|$|Nothing of {{this sort}} had ever {{occurred}} in my dreaming experience before, for I had often been humiliated because my dreams were only saved from being utterly disjointed and commonplace by the frequent terrors of nightmare. But I {{could not believe that}} I had been asleep, for I remembered distinctly the gradual <b>breaking-in</b> of the vision upon me, like the new images in a dissolving view, or the growing distinctness of the landscape as the sun lifts up the veil of the morning mist. And while I was conscious of this incipient vision, I was also conscious that Pierre came to tell my father Mr. Filmore was waiting for him, and that my father hurried out of the room. No, it was not a dream; was it--the thought was full of tremulous exultation--was it the poet's nature in me, hitherto only a troubled yearning sensibility, now manifesting itself suddenly as spontaneous creation? Surely it was in this way that Homer saw the plain of Troy, that Dante saw the abodes of the departed, that Milton saw the earthward flight of the Tempter. Was it that my illness had wrought some happy change in my organization--given a firmer tension to my nerves--carried off some dull obstruction? I had often read of such effects--in works of fiction at least. Nay; in genuine biographies I had read of the subtilizing or exalting influence of some diseases on the mental powers. Did not Novalis feel his inspiration intensified under the progress of consumption? ...|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} {{the two halves of}} the company, {{ensemble}} and principals, melted into one complete whole, the novelty of her new surroundings had worn off, and Jill was feeling that there had never been a time when she had not been one of a theatrical troupe, rehearsing. The pleasant social gatherings round Mr. Saltzburg's piano gave way in a few days to something far less agreeable and infinitely more strenuous, the <b>breaking-in</b> of the dances {{under the supervision of the}} famous Johnson Miller. Johnson Miller was a little man with snow-white hair and the india-rubber physique of a juvenile acrobat. Nobody knew actually how old he was, but he certainly looked much too advanced in years to be capable of the feats of endurance which he performed daily. He had the untiring enthusiasm of a fox-terrier, and had bullied and scolded more companies along the rocky road that leads to success than any half-dozen dance-directors in the country, in spite of his handicap in being almost completely deaf. He had an almost miraculous gift of picking up the melodies for which it was his business to design dances, without apparently hearing them. He seemed to absorb them through the pores. He had a blunt and arbitrary manner, and invariably spoke his mind frankly and honestly--a habit which made him strangely popular in a profession where the language of equivoque is cultivated almost as sedulously as in the circles of international diplomacy. What Johnson Miller said to your face was official, not subject to revision as soon as your back was turned, and people appreciated this.|$|E

50|$|One {{method of}} {{accelerating}} {{this is called}} Bat rolling. This is {{a process in which}} a machine uses rollers to apply pressure perpendicular to the composite baseball bat's surface, breaking down the composite fibers, etc..

As mentioned, bats eventually break-in on their own; rolling a bat simply speeds up the <b>breaking-in</b> process.|$|E

50|$|This need led to {{downhill}} {{boots that}} retained {{the same basic}} shoe-like style of earlier designs, but were built much stiffer to allow for greater control.

50|$|The {{performance}} of composite baseball bats typically improves with age. The {{reason for this}} is the <b>breaking-in</b> process; in other words, the force of striking the ball over and over eventually breaks down the bat's composite fibers and resinous glues that different manufacturers use. This improves the bat's Bat Performance Factor (BPF) or Ball Exit Speed Ratio (BESR). These factors are directly related to the rate of speed at which a struck ball comes off the bat; with higher speeds representing a greater danger to players in the infield (closer to the batter). Bats used in Little League play are required to remain below a league-specified values to be allowed in league play when new and after Accelerated Break-In (ABI).|$|E
50|$|The {{style of}} skiing {{allowed by the}} new {{bindings}} demanded new boots that were much stiffer as well, {{and a number of}} designs that were boiled in oil or soaked in glue became common in the 1950s. They were initially so rigid to be extremely uncomfortable, but softened up after a break-in period. The comfortable period was quite short, as the <b>breaking-in</b> (or down) process would continue until it became too soft to offer good control. A typical pair might last a single season - or only weeks for racers. The leather was far from ideal in other ways as well; it would soak up water or snow and then freeze, making them very difficult to get on or off while also offering little warmth.|$|E
50|$|These breaks {{are most}} often {{triggered}} {{by the presence of}} something old in a modern situation, for example a traditional nursery rhyme, an old photograph, or a house decorated with antiques.

When this <b>breaking-in</b> of 'Time' occurs, Investigators will be sent to assess the situation and then, if intervention is warranted, Operators are assigned {{to deal with the problem}} by a mysterious unseen authority, to be assisted by Specialists if necessary.|$|E
