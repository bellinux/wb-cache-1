25|$|However, the Institute's {{intentions}} were paternal and no democratic control by its students was intended. In 1829, radical Rowland Detrosier led a breakaway group {{to form the}} New Mechanics' Institution in Poole Street, a move that had a serious effect on the recruitment and finances of the original institute. Subscriptions and memberships in 1830–31 were an all-time low and only the gradual opening of the <b>board</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> election by the members rectified the situation. Detrosier's break-away ultimately rejoined the Institute.|$|E
500|$|Aiken was {{increasingly}} involved in social work, joining the Women's Liberal Club and the Trade Unions Council. [...] She supported {{a variety of}} causes including the improvement of conditions for children and orphans, hygiene and licensing regulations for beauticians, care facilities for the elderly, better schools, and controlling government waste. Aiken served as Secretary of the Save the Children organization {{and was a member}} of its executive <b>board</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her death. She was also involved in the birth control movement alongside other reformers like Amy Bailey and May Farquharson. She believed that until women could plan the size of their own families, they {{would not be able to}} improve the economic, educational, or moral status of the black community as they would be unable to devote quality support to large numbers of children. She joined the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU) and though the organization largely excluded women, she pressed for social and economic improvements for women. Aiken also helped establish a trade union for seamstresses, co-founded the Housecraft Training Center and was the only woman to serve on the Trade Unions Council.|$|E

6000|$|I {{did not see}} Mrs. Stubbs {{for some}} days after this, and the girls used {{to come down to}} meals, and never speak; going up again and {{stopping}} with their mother.

Lord Blenavon, who is a remarkably sensible young man, lent us his assistance. I tell you this quite frankly. I believe that it is best." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have been}} dining with Dilke to-day--He {{is up to}} his Ears in Walpole's letters. Mr. Manker is there, and I have come round to see if I can conjure up {{anything}} for you. Kirkman came down to see me this morning--his family has been very badly off lately. He told me of a villainous trick of his Uncle William in Newgate Street, who became sole Creditor to his father under pretence of serving him, and put an execution on his own Sister's goods. He went in to the family at Portsmouth; conversed with them, went out and sent in the Sherriff's officer. He tells me too of abominable behaviour of Archer to Caroline Mathew--Archer has lived nearly at the Mathews these two years; he has been amusing Caroline--and now he has written a Letter to Mrs. M. declining, on pretence of inability to support a wife as he would wish, all thoughts of marriage. What is the worst is Caroline is 27 years old. It is an abominable matter. He has called upon me twice lately--I was out both times. What can it be for?--There is a letter to-day in the Examiner to the Electors of Westminster on Mr. Hobhouse's account. In it {{there is a good}} character of Cobbett--I have not the paper by me or I would copy it. I do not think I have mentioned the discovery of an African Kingdom--the account is much the same as the first accounts of Mexico--all magnificence--There is a Book being written about it. I will read it and give you the cream in my next. The romance we have heard upon it runs thus: They have window frames of gold--100,000 infantry--human sacrifices. The Gentleman who is the Adventurer has his wife with him--she, I am told, is a beautiful little sylphid woman--her husband was to have been sacrificed to their Gods and was led through a Chamber filled with different instruments of torture with privilege to choose what death he would die, without their having a thought of his aversion to such a death, they considering it a supreme distinction. However he was let off, and became a favourite with the King, who at last openly patronised him, though at first on account of the Jealousy of his Ministers he was wont to hold conversations with his Majesty in the dark middle of the night. All this sounds a little Bluebeardish--but I hope it is true. There is another thing I must mention of the momentous kind;--but I must mind my periods in it--Mrs. Dilke has two Cats--a Mother and a Daughter--now the Mother is a tabby and the daughter a black and white like the spotted child. Now it appears to me, for the doors of both houses are opened frequently, so that there is a complete thoroughfare for both Cats (there being no <b>board</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the contrary), they may one and several of them come into my room ad libitum. But no--the Tabby only comes--whether from sympathy for Ann the Maid or me I cannot tell--or whether Brown has left behind him any atmospheric spirit of Maidenhood I cannot tell. The Cat is not an old Maid herself--her daughter is a proof of it--I have questioned her--I have look'd at the lines of her paw--I have felt her pulse--to no purpose. Why should the old Cat come to me? I ask myself--and myself has not a word to answer. It may come to light some day; if it does you shall hear of it.|$|E

50|$|The modern longboard has {{undergone}} many changes since its earlier {{models in the}} past. Today's longboard is much lighter than its predecessors. Its polyurethane foam and fiberglass design allows less drag on waves. Today's longboards are typically 8 to 10 ft long, although some ride <b>boards</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 12 ft in length. Additionally, there is a revival of stand-up paddle-based surfing with <b>boards</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 14 ft in length (for stability). The classic single-fin longboard retains much of its classic design including a single fin, weight, and considerable buoyancy. A longboard with a single fin allows the board to pivot turn {{in order to remain}} in the curl of the wave. Due to recent advances in technology, the longboard has expanded its family into different variations of the classic longboard.|$|R
