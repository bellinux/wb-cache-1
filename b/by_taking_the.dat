5|$|It {{was thought}} that Bradman would play Ring, but {{he changed his mind}} on the first morning of the First Test when rain was forecast.

Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.|$|E

5|$|Proposed definition: The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of {{luminous}} intensity {{in a given}} direction. It is defined <b>by</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency , Kcd, to be 683 when expressed in the unit lm⋅W−1, which is equal to cd⋅sr⋅W−1, or cd⋅sr⋅kg−1⋅m−2⋅s3, where the kilogram, metre and second are {{defined in terms of}} h, c and ΔνCs.|$|E
5|$|Slugging {{percentage}} measures a batter's {{ability to}} hit for power. It is calculated <b>by</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> batter's total bases (one per each single, two per double, three per triple, and four per home run) and dividing {{that by the}} batter's at bats.|$|E

5|$|Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) {{is used by}} the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{and other}} {{agencies}} to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons. It is calculated <b>by</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm (wind speed 35 knots or higher) at six-hour intervals. The numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable. The unit of ACE is 104 kn2, and for use as an index the unit is assumed. As well as being squared for ACE, wind speed can also be cubed, which {{is referred to as the}} Power Dissipation Index (PDI).|$|E

He won his first indoor NCAA title in the 200m and was runner-up in the 60m, having set a {{personal}} best of 6.59seconds in the heats. His time of 20.27seconds in the 200m final was the fastest indoor run {{in the world that}} year. His fastest of the season came at the Reebok invitational and his time of 20.25seconds placed him as the 13th fastest runner in 2006.

5|$|Montoya {{began to}} {{gradually}} {{pull away from}} Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Fisichella to take 14th place on lap two. Barrichello overtook Häkkinen at the Ostkurve corner to move into third one lap later. Further down the field, Button lost 13th position when he was passed by Panis on the same lap. On lap five, Panis made up a further position as he overtook Zonta for twelfth, while Bernoldi passed Button to take 14th. Barrichello moved into second position after he overtook Michael Schumacher at the Senna chicane on lap six. On the same lap, Zonta went into the rear of Verstappen's car, causing Zonta to lose his front wing. Verstappen fell behind Panis after the collision. Zonta made a pit stop for repairs, but retired after driving one exploratory lap. Verstappen made his pit stop and rejoined {{at the back of}} the field. Alesi passed Burti to move into 15th position on lap nine, and Panis overtook teammate Villeneuve for tenth place one lap later. On the tenth lap, Panis attempted to overtake Trulli for ninth <b>by</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> inside line, but was unable to complete the manoveure. Panis again tried to pass Trulli but <b>by</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> outside line on the next lap, although he could not execute the pass because of a lack of straightline speed. During the twelfth lap, Panis made his third attempt at passing Trulli and managed to get ahead of the Italian. Trulli pulled into the slipstream of Panis, and attempted to reclaim the position but spun at the Ostkurve corner, and fell to 17th.|$|E

5|$|At the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children, Bart feels out {{of place}} among the other {{students}} with advanced academic skills. Meanwhile, Marge attempts to stimulate Bart with a little culture <b>by</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> family to the opera. However, this proves disastrous as Bart and Homer are quite disruptive, much to Lisa's joy. Ostracized by his brilliant classmates, Bart visits his former school, where his old friends reject {{him because of his}} perceived intelligence. On the bright side, he enjoys newfound attention from Homer and he covers for them when Marge makes another attempt to stimulate Bart's brain by taking them to a film festival. After Bart's chemistry experiment explodes, filling the school lab with green goo, he confesses to Dr. Pryor that he switched tests with Martin. Dr. Pryor realizes that he was never a genius and has him readmitted to Springfield Elementary.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari ordered Massa {{to reduce}} his car speed on his out-lap to help Alonso {{minimise}} the effects of losing second position. Glock drove back to his pit box where his mechanics examined his car for damage and decided to retire him from the race. Kubica avoided making contact with Sutil when his lollipop man stopped him before he could drive away from his pit box. It {{was the second time}} that season Kubica and Sutil were involved in an incident in a pit lane; Kubica had made contact with Sutil when the latter was driving into his pit box in the Hungarian Grand Prix. The safety car drove into the pit lane {{at the end of the}} thirty-fourth lap and Vettel led at the restart. Hamilton ran deep, heading into the first corner and allowing Alonso to retake second position and immediately came under attack from Massa. Kubica took eighth place from Hülkenberg <b>by</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> inside line at the third corner. Sutil took to the inside line and passed Button for twelfth on lap thirty-six. Button was pushed wide onto the run-off area and fell to fifteenth position.|$|E

5|$|In June 1904, {{during the}} experiments, Zammit {{learned that a}} Maltese family of five members became {{simultaneously}} ill after consuming fresh unpasteurized milk from goats. Zammit decided to purchase healthy goats and tested them, {{and at one point}} also kept them {{on the first floor of}} the Castellania (then known as the public health building or the variants). Zammit was successful in the discovery of the disease. David Bruce, who led the MFC, discouraged the experiments when proposed by Zammit. However, when the experiment concluded in the discovery, Bruce tried to discredit Zammit <b>by</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> merit for himself. Information about the role of Zammit was kept low profile or ignored. The fever was renamed after Bruce, as brucellosis. The MFC managed to find cure and ways to eradicate the fever, but had a hard time since there was lack of cooperation with sellers and consumers of milk, some dismissing or ignoring the finding. It was under control by 1938, with the enforcement of standard procedures of pasteurizing milk. However, slaughtering of infected animals continued throughout the 20th century and there was another rising challenge for the department in 1994 and 1995.|$|E
5|$|In October–December 1990, {{a team of}} {{employees}} from programming studio Softdisk calling themselves Ideas from the Deep developed the three-part video game Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, the first game in the Commander Keen series. The group, who worked at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana developing games for the Gamer's Edge video game subscription service and disk magazine, was composed of programmers John Romero and John Carmack, designer Tom Hall, artist Adrian Carmack, and manager Jay Wilbur. After {{the release of the}} game in December through shareware publisher Apogee Software, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss, Softdisk owner Al Vekovius, confronted them on both their plans and their use of company resources to develop the game—the team had created it on their work computers, both in the office after hours and <b>by</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> computers to John Carmack's house on the weekends—the team made no secret of their intentions. After a few weeks of negotiation, the team agreed to produce a series of games for Gamer's Edge, one every two months.|$|E
