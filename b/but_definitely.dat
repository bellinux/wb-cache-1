Before {{the outbreak of}} World War II only ninety were intended to be delivered in 194042 to equip the Chemical Troops (Nebeltruppen), but the 3 May 1940 production plan mentions {{that was to be}} produced at a rate of thirty per month until a total of 400 have been built and thereafter at ten per month. The last mention is a report that MWC was to complete ten vehicles by 15 January 1943. Production may have continued after that, <b>but</b> <b>definitely</b> not after 1943.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of the 3rd edition, Blood Bowl moved closer to the {{traditional}} Warhammer Fantasy Battle world by changing the miniatures to look more similar to their Warhammer Fantasy Battle counterparts. Jervis Johnson, designer of the game, has admitted this was not the best direction for the game, and has since stated that the Blood Bowl world is similar to, <b>but</b> <b>definitely</b> not the same as, the Warhammer world. Recent changes to the rules reflect this, and newer miniatures for the game look more sporty in nature.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrialization}} {{drive was}} meant to be primarily a Peruvian process not totally excluding foreign investors <b>but</b> <b>definitely</b> not welcoming them warmly. In that spirit, the Velasco regime immediately nationalized IPC in October 1968 and, not long after that, the largest copper mining company, while taking over other foreign firms more peacefully through buy-outs. The government put into place new restrictions on foreign investment in Peru and led the way to a regional agreement, the Andean Pact, that featured some of the most extensive controls on foreign investment yet attempted in the developing world.|$|E

25|$|India batted with composure, grit, and the {{occasional}} flamboyance - the latter coming from Sehwag especially, who plundered nine fours and a six {{on his way to}} a 22-ball 48 before Vaas curved a short one into his body and Sehwag obligingly chopped onto his stumps. It had arguably given India a perfect start, and had included a 22-run over off Dilhara. Ganguly was lbw to Dilshan in the 16th over, but Yuvraj and Dravid set the scene for an Indian victory, pairing up for 84 for the third wicket as India needed 98 in 15 overs. Tricky, <b>but</b> <b>definitely</b> possible in today's ODI cricket.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary reports {{indicate}} that bufotenine-containing toad venom {{has been used as}} a street drug; that is, as a supposed aphrodisiac (it is not an aphrodisiac <b>but</b> <b>definitely</b> is a lethal poison), ingested orally in the form of ch’an su, and as a psychedelic, by smoking or orally ingesting Bufo toad venom or dried Bufo skins. The use of chan'su and love stone (a related toad venom preparation used as an aphrodisiac in the West Indies) has resulted in several cases of poisoning and at least one death. The practice of orally ingesting toad venom has been referred to in popular culture and in the scientific literature as toad licking and has drawn media attention. Albert Most, founder of the Church of the Toad of Light and a proponent of spiritual use of Bufo alvarius venom, published a booklet titled Bufo alvarius: The Psychedelic Toad of the Sonoran Desert in 1983 which explained how to extract and smoke the secretions.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, Irresistible was {{not well}} {{received}} by critics who said the album sounded generic and over-produced. Chuck Campbell of Daily News gave the album a rating of 2.5 out of 5. He said the album was [...] "nothing but a footnote", and remarked that the songs sounded too similar to works by Spears and Aguilera. He concluded by commenting on Simpson's version of [...] "His Eye Is on the Sparrow": [...] "So if her pop fortunes fail, perhaps she'll find some contemporary Christian singers to imitate." [...] Teresa Gubbins of The Dallas Morning News wrote that it [...] "doesn't do much to set her apart. It's likable <b>but</b> <b>definitely</b> not distinctive – just another formulaic entry into the already saturated teen-pop field." [...] She gave the album a grade of C.|$|E
500|$|The false {{chanterelle}} {{has been described}} as edible (though not tasty) by some experts, but other authors report it as potentially poisonous. Indeed, Fries described it as venenatus, meaning [...] "poisonous", in 1821. David Arora speculates that the confusion about edibility may be a result of misidentification with the similar-looking <b>but</b> <b>definitely</b> poisonous Omphalotus species. However, extracts made from Nigerian collections were mildly toxic to mice. Some people experience gastrointestinal symptoms after eating the mushroom, possibly due to its high levels of the sugar alcohol arabitol. It was eaten, though not especially highly regarded, by the Zapotec people of Ixtlán de Juárez in Oaxaca. The Tepehuán people of northwestern Mexico also occasionally eat the mushroom, which they refer to in their native language as guin'xacan ("delightful") or kia's gio ("iguana lard"); there, it is commonly prepared by roasting over charcoal, or boiling and garnishing with cheese.|$|E
500|$|Following season finale, the San Jose Mercury News said [...] "If they [...] want to {{be taken}} seriously, the shows could take a cue from Canadian drama Degrassi: The Next Generation, which ... {{addresses}} the same gritty teen issues without being far-fetched", and Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle echoed that by adding [...] "Degrassi: The Next Generation has cultivated a loyal audience by avoiding the sugar-coating niceties of old-school teen TV and by treating those 10- to 14-year-olds as, well, not adults per se, <b>but</b> <b>definitely</b> maturing viewers. Degrassi focuses on a high school with a disparate student body, with countless individual stories to tell (which is why the franchise has lasted this long). There's nothing corny or sweet about [...] "Degrassi" [...] as it boldly tackles everything from obesity to date rape, thongs to drugs". Others, such as The Advocate gave praise and said the series was breaking new ground by depicting a gay romance between two teenaged boys.|$|E

500|$|Most reviews {{compared}} {{the game with}} F-Zero X which was released a month earlier, with the general assumption that Nintendo's own futuristic racer offered more tracks and racing craft, but Wipeout 64 contained superior track design and atmosphere. GameSpot gave the game a lower score of 6.9 out of 10, stating that [...] "WipeOut 64 isn't horrible, it just feels like the developer's first effort for the system at times - which it is". [...] "Sayewonn" [...] of Gaming Age gave Wipeout 64 8 out of 10 stars, praising its new innovations, especially its analogue control, saying that [...] "adapting analogue controls was the biggest improvement racing games made and Wipeout 64 demonstrates that beautifully". Sayewonn {{also noted that the}} game still had a [...] "learning curve", saying that [...] "it’s not as brutal as the first game <b>but</b> <b>definitely</b> harder than the far easier XL". However, despite being complimentary of Wipeout 64, both GameSpot and Gaming Age recommended purchasing F-Zero X instead.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from television sources and critics. Alex Rocha of TV Guide {{called it a}} [...] "pretty dull episode, but with some bright humorous spots [...] The episode {{looked like it had}} potential, <b>but</b> <b>definitely</b> did not perform to its best." [...] Ahsan Haque of IGN called it [...] "far from perfect" [...] but [...] "definitely a lot better than the terrible O.J. Simpson episode from last week." [...] He called the Handi-Quacks scenes [...] "fantastic" [...] and called the episode overall [...] "definitely {{a step in the right}} direction." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic said: [...] "More purpose in the plot and more jokes related to the story than usual" [...] and gave the episode 40 out of 100. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "tonight's Family Guy was the best it's been in a looooong time". He stated that in both plotlines [...] "the game is established early [...] and the show escalates nicely", and graded the episode a B.|$|E
500|$|Themistocles {{was born}} in Athens around 524BC, the son of Neocles, who was, {{in the words of}} Plutarch [...] "no very {{conspicuous}} man". His mother is more obscure; according to Plutarch, she was either a Thracian woman called Abrotonon, or Euterpe, a Carian from Halicarnassus. Like many contemporaries, little is known of his early years. Some authors report that he was unruly as a child and was consequently disowned by his father. Plutarch considers this to be false. Plutarch indicates that, on account of his mother's background, Themistocles was considered something of an outsider; furthermore the family appear to have lived in an immigrant district of Athens, Cynosarges, outside the city walls. However, in an early example of his cunning, Themistocles persuaded [...] "well-born" [...] children to exercise with him in Cynosarges, thus breaking down the distinction between [...] "alien and legitimate". Plutarch further reports that Themistocles was preoccupied, even as a child, with preparing for public life. His teacher is said to have told him: [...] "My boy, you will be nothing insignificant, <b>but</b> <b>definitely</b> something great, either for good or evil." ...|$|E

[...] He noted that they [...] "get sidetracked" [...] with the blackouts in this episode, and then Gabe asks Johnson to leave. Luna said [...] "that look on his face you see is perhaps a little disappointment in that he started to have a bond with someone he hasn’t killed. I think that face you see is one of—not fear, <b>but</b> <b>definitely</b> concern that the one person who knows that Robbie Reyes is Ghost Rider is now back out there running around, doing whatever she has to do." [...] Whedon called Gabe asking Johnson to leave Robbie [...] "another blow to Daisy and her emotional makeup" [...] as she [...] "has been trying to operate alone, because she doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone else. Now ... Gabe voices her very fear".|$|E
500|$|Bedingfield {{finished}} {{recording the}} album in July 2010. The project's title was unveiled through Bedingfield's official Twitter page on 15 July 2010. She described the album as [...] "be {{the next level}} from what I've already done....It's just more vibrant and exciting. And I can't wait for people to hear it." [...] In an interview with Billboard, Bedingfield said: [...] The thirteen-track standard edition, the twenty-one track deluxe edition and pre-order bonus track editions of the album were compiled from more than 50 songs which Bedingfield had written since touring. In an interview with PopEater she said [...] "I've been touring {{for so many years}} now that I wrote with my live gigs in mind. I wanted to write anthems that people could sing along to – things that were still personal, <b>but</b> <b>definitely</b> trying to find the best way to connect with people." [...] On the album she worked with Andreas Kleerup, John Hill, Wyclef Jean, Salaam Remi, Ryan Tedder, Jonas Myrin, Eg White and Sia Furler. None of the songs worked on with Jean, Remi or Furler made the final track listing, although all of the songs on the final track list were co-written by Bedingfield. Additionally Idolator revealed that Bedingfield had recorded a Ne-Yo-assisted duet titled [...] "The Little Things", which was produced by StarGate, though it was not included on the final pressing either. Bedingfield told fans in December 2010, via a recorded video message, that the album could be released elsewhere in the world later on but for the near present she was focusing on America.|$|E
500|$|Reception to the character's {{conflicting}} {{looks and}} psychotic behavior has been mixed, though with {{elements such as}} her sexual allure and shock value well received, particularly in regards to her Fatalities. According to Joey Esposito of MTV, Mortal Kombat II [...] "added ... sexually suggestive characters in Mileena and Kitana, but the tables were turned" [...] with Mileena’s [...] "Man Eater" [...] Fatality, which he ranked among the [...] "nine Mortal Kombat Fatalities that warped your childhood." [...] CU Amiga called it [...] "the kiss of death to end all kisses". Mileena shared seventh place with Kitana on GamesRadar's 2006 list of top seven [...] "girls kissing girls" [...] in 2006, and Paul Drury of Retro Gamer elected [...] "Kitana's and Mileena's deadly kisses" [...] as his favorite Fatalities. In 2011, Topless Robot's Ryan Aston ranked Mileena as the sixth-most goofy Mortal Kombat character as [...] "a pretty succinct commentary on the deplorable image of women in videogames" [...] and for her absurd [...] "Man-Eater" [...] finisher, but nevertheless calling her [...] "quite the looker". Complex ranked Mileena's biting off an opponent's head as the eighth-best finishing move in the series, noting [...] "a sexual element that was creepily out of context." [...] In 2012, Game Rant ranked Mileena's [...] "just sick" [...] "Yummy" [...] finisher from Mortal Kombat: Deception as the series' second-best Fatality of all time. Kotaku included her [...] "Nail Shooter" [...] Fatality from Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 among their choices of [...] "the most gruesome video game deaths" [...] in 2013, commenting it was [...] "not necessarily the bloodiest one, <b>but</b> <b>definitely</b> one of the funniest." ...|$|E

500|$|Claudia Black {{joined the}} cast {{full-time}} in season 10. Had Stargate SG-1 not {{been picked up}} for a new season, the producers would have considered the character for a spin-off series. To justify the character in a regular capacity, the producers toned her down and {{tried to find a}} suitable balance of sexual tension, fun and friendship. Claudia Black was convinced that Vala's actual stay with Stargate Command was justified despite the character's personality. Vala's renegade qualification to infiltrate the Ori served as a useful complement to the military-oriented SG teams, and Vala had already proven a degree of allegiance through her actions in [...] "Beachhead", holding off an immediate invasion of the enemy. The writers tested this loyalty through confrontation in the story, and writer Damian Kindler later compared Vala's character growth in season 10 to smuggler Lando Calrissian from Star Wars, a [...] "former swindler who's gone legit". Careful to never have Vala become too earnest, Kindler never saw Vala [...] "as the type of character who should be on the show for five, six, seven years. <b>But</b> <b>definitely</b> the sort of character who could come in for a couple of seasons, spice things up and then move on and come back and forth." [...] Evolving the relationship between Vala and the other SG-1 members, the producers also grew comfortable with pairing Browder's and Black's characters more often, and even teased (and misled) viewers about them [...] "end up in a motel room bed together" [...] in the episode [...] "Memento Mori", involving underwear, [...] "handcuffs as well as creamy Twinkies". A scene in the milestone episode [...] "200" [...] also parodied the show's connection to Farscape. In hindsight, Claudia Black would see season 10 as a personal challenge as her baby deprived her of sleep during the filming period. Her relocation to Vancouver and sickness in the family put her on a self-confessed personal and professional low. She nevertheless tried to stay true to her character [...] "and not go for the cheap laugh".|$|E
