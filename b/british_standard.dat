5|$|In the United States, the American Kennel Club(AKC) and the Labrador's breed club {{have set}} the breed {{standard}} to accommodate the field-bred Labrador somewhat. For instance, the AKC withers-height standards allow conformation dogs to be slightly taller than the equivalent <b>British</b> <b>standard.</b> However, dual champions, or dogs that excel in both {{the field and the}} show ring, are becoming more unusual.|$|E

The <b>British</b> <b>standard</b> weight for bantam Silkies is 600 g (22oz) for males, and 500 g for females (18oz).|$|E
5|$|A {{major feature}} in the early {{development}} of Modern English was the codification of explicit norms for standard usage, and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language {{in an effort to}} establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the <b>British</b> <b>standard.</b> Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{variety of}} clay {{specimens}} (Kaolin, Belfast Upper Boulder Clay and Belfast Sleech) {{were subjected to}} <b>British</b> <b>Standards</b> Triaxial Permeability Tests and Accelerated Permeability Tests {{in order to examine}} how the permeability predicted (under uniform effective stresses and conditions) varied depending on the testing method adopted. The specimens were then freeze-dried to preserve their post-test state, and examined using a Scanning Electron Microscope, in order to analyse their soil structure. In all cases the Accelerated Permeability Test predicted a value of permeability lower than that predicted by the <b>British</b> <b>Standards</b> Triaxial Permeability Test. Likewise, the soil structure present in the Accelerated Permeability Test specimens showed marked differences when compared to soil structure present in the <b>British</b> <b>Standards</b> Triaxial Permeability Test specimens; however the differences were not constant throughout the specimens. It was concluded that Accelerated Permeability Tests do result in soil structure degradation; however the full extent of this is not yet known. To ascertain this, it is recommended that a series of Accelerated Permeability and <b>British</b> <b>Standards</b> Triaxial Permeability Tests are performed on a variety of clays under varying effective stresses, along with a series of <b>British</b> <b>Standards</b> Uniaxial Compression Tests on these specimens post-test. ...|$|R
