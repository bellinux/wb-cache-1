40|$|Enthesitis is an {{inflammatory}} lesion of the tendon, ligament and capsular insertions into the bone, {{and it is}} a fundamental element in the diagnosis of spondyloarthropathies. Sonography is the method of choice for studying periarticular soft tissues because it is capable of detecting both the early (oedema, thickening) and late alterations (erosions and enthesophytes); it is also an inexpensive, <b>biologically</b> <b>harmless</b> and easily repeatable technique. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the prevalence of quadricipital enthesitis in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, and to document any clinical and echostructural differences in this lesion between the two diseases. The results show that enthesitis is more frequent in PsA patients, more than half of whom are asymptomatic. Knee inflammation was found in the PsA patients with enthesitis regardless of the concomitant presence of joint effusion; none of the RA patients suffered from enthesitis alone. Quadricipital enthesitis is more frequent in male patients. There was no significant correlation between the presence of peripatellar psoriatic lesions and enthesitis. Sonographic examinations of patients with enthesitis revealed that those with RA had predominantly inflammatory lesions, whereas PsA patients also showed major new bone deposition...|$|E
30|$|Heavy metals are {{generally}} recognized to {{be a threat}} toward humans and ecosystems because of their high-potential toxicity. They could not be <b>biologically</b> decomposed into <b>harmless</b> materials and, to matters worse, were accumulated in the organisms (Adewunmi et al. 1996). In particular, Pb(II) has been classified as a serious hazardous heavy metal with high priority in the context of environmental risk (Volesky 2001). This metal is extremely toxic and can damage the kidney, liver, brain, nervous, and reproductive systems; among other adverse effects to humans (Godwin 2001). Drinking water containing Pb(II) ions for a long term, even if in a very low concentration, cause a wide range of spectrum health problems, such as renal failure, coma, nausea, cancer, convulsions and subtle effects on metabolism and intelligence (Rashed 2001; Li et al. 2005). It can cause mental retardation and semi-permanent brain damage in young children (Mohammad and Najar 1997). Pb(II) has the ability to replace calcium in the bone to form sites for long-term release (King et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} mixed-ligand complex {{formation}} is important problem of coordination chemistry currently. The ligands of different nature within the domestic {{environment of the}} complex, have a mutual influence, changing the chemical properties of complexes (acid-base, oxidation-reduction, the rate of ligand substitution in the internal environment) and their biological activity. According to the literature, the issues of mutual influence of ligands, {{which leads to a}} change in the reactivity of the complexes have been widely studied with the assistance of ligands of different nature. In recent years sharply increased interest in nanoobjects of different nature. This {{is due to the fact}} that many of the physical, chemical and biological properties of the nanoparticles significantly different characteristics from those of larger (macroscopic) objects. The aim of the study was to examine the conditions of formation (ratio of components, acidity) in solutions of mixed-metal biocomplexes copper. The studies have shown that the conditions of synthesis have significant impact on obtaining nanoparticles of zinc, copper and cobalt. The study of morphology and size of the resulting nanoparticles were performed on a scanning electron microscope Quanta FEG 650 in high vacuum (pressure in the chamber 8 ⋅ 10 - 3 to 3 ⋅ 10 - 3 Pa) mode. The resulting nanoparticles are studied metal particles kanglomeraty complex structure of various shapes and sizes up to 200 nm, and the crystals are spherical shape sizes of 40 – 90 nm. It is shown that metal complexation with drugs (ligands) leads to improvement of antimicrobial activity spectrum and expansion relative to the parent ligands, the studied biocomplexes are <b>harmless</b> <b>biologically</b> active substances, which can be recommended for further study...|$|R
40|$|The {{olfactory}} system {{is vital for}} insects {{in their ability to}} seek food, reproduce, and orientate. Information about different odors, produced by plants or conspecifics, elicits behavioral responses in the insects. Knowledge about how chemical substances change the insects? behavior may be used in development of pest-specific and <b>biologically</b> <b>harmless</b> insecticides. One biologically relevant odor cue is carbon dioxide (CO 2). This master?s project used the noctuid moth Heliothis virescens as model organism for mapping the central neural pathways involved in processing of CO 2 information. By injecting dye into the CO 2 sensory organ on the labial palps, it was possible to visualize the labial pit organ glomerulus (LPOG) in the antennal lobes of living individuals. Subsequent retrograde stainings of the LPOG revealed distinct projection pathways to higher brain centers. The stained projection neurons were demonstrated to follow two of the main antenno-protocerebral tracts; the lateral- and the medio-lateral antenno-protocerebral tract. Both of the neural bundles showed extensive branching in the protocerebrum. Two main termination areas were found to receive information from the LPOG; the lateral- and superior protocerebrum. No projection neurons followed the route via the medial antenno-protocerebral tract to the mushroom body calyces. This indicates that information about CO 2 is processed only by an experience-independent pathway. All projection neurons originating from the LPOG were found to be uniglomerular, also those passing in the medio-lateral tract. This is in contrast to findings related to the general {{olfactory system}} where the last mentioned tract includes fibers of multiglomerular projection neurons. Comparison of the CO 2 pathways in males and females showed no indications of sexual dimorphism. In total, the results from this study show significant differences between the general olfactory system and the CO 2 system of H. virescens. </p...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge on how {{an insect}} s {{behavior}} changes {{in response to}} chemical substances in the environment can ultimately {{contribute to the development}} of <b>biologically</b> <b>harmless</b> pest controls. One of the links between sensory processing systems in the brain and motoric output is thought to be the neurons mediating the pre-processed information from the brain to act on motor circuits in the ganglia of insects. In the present study, the noctuid moth Heliothis virescens was the insect of study, and the thoracic ganglion of in total 88 preparations was stained with fluorescent dye to systematically study the descending neurons mediating information out of their brains. Performing mass-staining of the thoracic ganglion have contributed to knowledge on the areas where these neurons originates or projects. Visualizing the stained neurons in a confocal microscope showed condensed staining of dendrites of descending neurons in the anterior-ventral part of the lateral protocerebrum and in the lateral accessory lobes. Knowing that processing of chemosensory information might result in activities of behavioral relevance, it was especially interesting to see whether projection neurons making up the olfactory axis in the lateral protocerebrum overlapped spatially with dendrites of descending neurons eventually terminating in motor systems in the thoracic ganglia. Double staining of both the antennal lobe and the thoracic ganglion were therefore performed in the same individual, in 31 preparations. Three dimensional reconstruction and registration of descending neurons into the digital standard brain atlas (SBA) of H. virescens supported the spatial position of descending neurons in the anterior-ventral part of the lateral protocerebrum. The SBA containing the descending neurons was visually compared to a separate SBA containing the olfactory axis in the lateral protocerebrum, indicating no or minimal spatial overlap between the olfactory axis and the dendrites of descending neurons. This highlights the need for a detailed examination to discover if sensory information can be transferred to motor systems via 3 rd order neurons local to the protocerebrum...|$|E
40|$|Magnet {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is a widely}} used cross-sectional imaging modality. Although <b>biologically</b> <b>harmless,</b> literature highlights problems with MRI associated patient distress. The present trial was designed to evaluate if a specially developed interactive animation tool can help reduce patients’ distress. It furthermore gives an overview about the occurrence and severity of acute stress reaction within a modern open designed MRI setting. The randomized, controlled bi-centered trial included 106 patients, mean age 46 (+- 14). Patients in the study group (n= 56) were allowed {{to make use of}} Ambient Experience® (Version 2. 0) during the examination, whereas patients in the control group (n= 50) received a standard MRI examination in the same device („ 1. 0 T Panorama HFO®“) based at Campus Charité Mitte or Unfallkrankenhaus, Berlin. Patients were scheduled to the trial between June and December 2009 as an ad-hoc sample, if no exclusion criteria was presented. The primary outcome measures comprised the intraindividual differences in cortisol concentration in saliva, heart-rate as well as selected emotions at different time points during the examination meassured in a Cortisol Assay, via Pulseoxymetrie, State-scale of the STAI and via Visual Analogue Scales. Secondary outcome measures were defined in order to demonstrate group comparability regarding potential bias. The mean duration of MRI was 37 (+- 15, 89) minutes. Both groups were comparable regarding sociodemographic characteristics, examination properties as well as MRIassociated stress risk factors (all p> 0, 05). In the study group cortisol increased in mean by 0, 0089 (+- 0, 0053) μg/dl followed by a decrease of - 0, 0022 (+- 0. 111) μg/dl. Control group patients showed a constant decrease from avarage cortisol concentrations of - 0, 0158 (+- 0, 67) μg/dl at the first measurement to - 0, 033 (+- 0, 09) μg/dl at the second measurement. The average heart rate decreased in study group by - 4, 6 (+- 6, 73) bpm and - 6, 2 (+- 10, 14) bpm in control patients. The state fear diminished by - 4, 4 (+- 8, 34) points in average in the study group and by - 3, 13 (+- 7, 39) points in the control group. Statistically significant group dependent differences were not demonstrated. Clinically significant increase of salivary cortisol was shown for 11 % of the patients. 5, 7 % of the sample had significant increase in heart rate. 18 % of patients had relevant stress. 14 % rated themselves as nervous and 9, 4 % very afraid. Within the scope of this RCT no stress reducing effect for Ambient Experience was demonstrated. Although this trial took place {{with one of the most}} modern and patient centered MRI design, relevant stress was found for 29 % of the sample...|$|E
