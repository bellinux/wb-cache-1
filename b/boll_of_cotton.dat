40|$|Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is {{the most}} {{important}} fiber-yielding crop grown in India and worldwide. In India, during 2012 - 2013, 1. 16 million ha were under cotton cultivation, with an average production of 480 kg/ha. As production <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> has increased in areas, so has the occurrence of various pests and diseases. During a field survey conducted in the cotton-growing areas of Devalapura Village of the Mysore District during August and September 2013, a boll rot disease was observed with distinctive symptoms and signs of a fungal pathogen observed in 27 % of fields. Incidence <b>of</b> the <b>boll</b> rot within fields ranged from 8 to 12 %, while 3 to 5 % stem rot was observed on boll rot-affected plants in about 15 to 18 ha <b>of</b> total <b>cotton</b> fields surveyed. White mycelial strands with spherical, dark-brown sclerotial bodies were found on the surface <b>of</b> infected <b>bolls</b> near the ground and the affected bolls were completely decayed. The disease-affected bolls were disinfested with 2 % sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 min, and 5 -mm samples were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium and incubated at 28 ± 2 °C. The fungal colonies that grew from infected tissues were whitish with cottony aerial mycelium and abundant globoid sclerotia observed after 10 to 12 days of incubation. Sclerotial bodies were initially pale whitish, becoming dark brown over time. Based on morphological and cultural characteristics, the associated fungal pathogen was identified as Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. The identity of the pathogen was further confirmed through PCR amplification of internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region using ITS 1 /ITS 4 universal primer. The amplified PCR product (550 to 570 bp) was sequenced and BLASTn search comparison revealed 100 % homology with Sclerotium rolfsii (Accession Nos. JF 966208 and JX 914480). A representative sequence of S. rolfsii was deposited in GenBank (KP 412471. 1 and KP 412472. 1). Further, pathogenicity tests were conducted on 30 healthy cotton bolls in vivo by inoculating the bolls with sclerotia obtained from 12 -day-old cultures; noninoculated bolls served as controls. Characteristic boll rot symptoms were observed on 60 % <b>of</b> total inoculated <b>cotton</b> <b>bolls</b> 7 days after inoculation and S. rolfsii was reisolated from the infected bolls and the identity of the pathogen was confirmed. S. rolfsii is a serious soil-borne fungal pathogen with a wide host range (Mullen 2001) and prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, where high temperature and moisture are sufficient to permit growth and survival of the fungal pathogen (Punja 1985). The association of S. rolfsii with <b>boll</b> rot <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> has been reported from Bangladesh (Shamsi et al. 2008). In India, major diseases <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> include wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. vasinfectum), anthracnose (Colletotrichum capsici), and areolate mildew (Ramularia areola) (Rangaswamy and Mahadevan 2002). S. rolfsii infect bolls on branches near ground level, causing boll decay. Numerous sclerotia produced on the affected bolls are the source of secondary inoculum and are dispersed by rain splash during the late monsoon, thus resulting in new infections on the basal stem and leaves <b>of</b> the <b>cotton</b> plant. The disease has resulted in reduced yield and market value of the crop. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the occurrence of S. rolfsii causing <b>boll</b> rot <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> in India...|$|R

The larval period ranged from 8. 2 to 9. 2 days on buds and 9. 2 - 12. 2 days on <b>bolls</b> <b>of</b> different <b>cotton</b> genotypes. The mean larval period irrespective of food was significantly shorter in G. arboreum as compared to G. hirsutum cultivars. Pre-oviposition period (2. 42 days) was longer on G. arboreum genotype than on G. hirsutum genotypes (1. 44 - 2. 00 days), while the reverse was true for oviposition and post-oviposition periods. Larval survival, pupation, adult emergence, fecundity, incubation period, and egg hatchability were significantly lower on G. arboreum than on G. hirsutum. The first- and third-instar larvae of spotted bollworm preferred buds than bolls in both, G. arboreum and G. hirsutum genotypes. Multi-choice assays on larval preference for buds and bolls among different genotypes revealed that the preference for buds of G. arboreum was significantly higher by the first-instar and lower by the third-instar larvae than the G. hirsutum variety and hybrids. G. hirsutum cultivars were more preferred than the G. arboreum variety, and among the plant parts the lower leaf surface, buds and bolls were preferred over the other plant parts for egg laying by the female.

They worked on finding a solution to the <b>boll</b> weevil infestation <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> crops and concluded that the [...] "dusting" [...] of an insecticide powder from the air would be the most effective form of treatment.

The company moved to Monroe, Louisiana, in 1925. Woolman left his position with the extension service and in the off-season traveled with the company to Peru, where they helped to establish crop-dusting and passenger services. With this experience, Woolman returned to the United States and in 1928 raised the capital to buy Huff Daland, purchasing it on September 13, 1928, and renaming the company Delta Air Service, with its headquarters in Monroe.

Two traits i. e., yield <b>of</b> seed <b>cotton</b> and number <b>of</b> <b>bolls</b> per plant showed complete adequacy of additive dominance model. Two characters lint percentage and seed index partially passed the assumption for diallel analysis. Both additive and dominance (non-additive) variations were observed in the diallel cross population for yield <b>of</b> seed <b>cotton</b> per plant, boll numbers per plant, lint percentage and seed index. The magnitude of non-additive genetic components were greater than additive for yield <b>of</b> seed <b>cotton</b> per plant and seed index, whereas the value of additive genetic components were higher than dominance for boll numbers per plant. The substantial contribution to dominance was due to heterogeneity of loci for the four traits analysed in this experiment. The recessive alleles were in excess in the parents for yield <b>of</b> seed <b>cotton</b> per plant, number <b>of</b> <b>bolls</b> per plant, lint percentage and seed index. The operation of over-dominance was estimated for yield <b>of</b> seed <b>cotton</b> per plant and seed index whereas partial dominance was observed for boll number per plant. The lint percentage possessed complete dominance in this set of diallel cross. The ratio {{of positive and negative}} alleles at the loci exhibiting dominance were in equal proportion in these parents for yield <b>of</b> seed <b>cotton</b> per plant and number <b>of</b> <b>bolls</b> per plant whereas asymmetrical distribution of negative and positive alleles among the parents was suggested for lint percentage and seed index.

40|$|The {{correlation}} {{studies showed}} that in the plant material studied, plant height, monopodial branches and No. <b>of</b> <b>bolls</b> per plant were revealed to be significantly correlated with seed cotton yield at genotypic level. The correlation between No. <b>of</b> <b>bolls</b> per plant and plant yield appeared to be strong as compared with other combinations. In addition, plant height showed positive and significant relationship with No. of sympodial branches, No. <b>of</b> <b>bolls</b> per plant and ginning %age. Path coefficient analysis revealed that No. of monopodial branches, No. <b>of</b> <b>bolls</b> per plant had maximum positive direct effect on yield <b>of</b> seed <b>cotton.</b> Therefore, it may be suggested that negative direct effects of plant height, No. of sympodial branches and ginning out turn may be considered as selection criteria to effect indirect improvement in yield <b>of</b> seed <b>cotton</b> and quality in the present breeding material. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{gene for}} the Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Berliner) insect toxic protein {{is a new}} advance in {{technology}} for pink bollworm (PBW), Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), control. We conducted studies in 1999 to investigate grower concern for reduced efficacy of NuCOTN 33 b (Bt cotton) (Monsanto Company, St Louis, MO) in late-season because of breakdown or non-expression of the toxic protein. We compared the susceptibility of Bt and Deltapine 5415 (Monsanto Company, St Louis, MO) (non-Bt) cotton bolls to PBW at periodic intervals during {{the first and second}} cotton fruiting cycles. We placed > 200 PBW eggs per boll on the inside surface of bracts <b>of</b> susceptible immature <b>cotton</b> <b>bolls.</b> The artificially infested bolls were later harvested and examined for evidence of PBW infestation. High percentages of both Bt and non-Bt cotton bolls had numerous larval entrance holes in the carpel walls <b>of</b> the <b>bolls.</b> Less than 1 % <b>of</b> the Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>bolls</b> and over 70 % <b>of</b> the non-Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>bolls</b> were found with living PBW larvae. Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>bolls</b> <b>of</b> the late-season second fruiting cycle were as resistant to PBW infestation as Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>bolls</b> <b>of</b> the first fruiting cycle...|$|R
40|$|A Cotton leaf crumple virus (CLCrV) -based gene {{silencing}} vector containing {{a fragment of}} the Gossypium hirsutum Magnesium chelatase subunit I was used to establish endogenous {{gene silencing}} in <b>cotton</b> <b>of</b> varied genetic backgrounds. Biolistic inoculation resulted in systemic and persistent photo-bleaching of the leaves and <b>bolls</b> <b>of</b> the seven cultivars tested, however, the intensity of silencing was variable. CLCrV-VIGS-mediated expression of green fluorescent protein was used to monitor the in planta distribution of the vector, indicating successful phloem invasion in all cultivars tested.

40|$|Four cotton {{varieties}} viz. 1517 - 75, D 2 -L- 9 - 68, M- 4 and CIM- 240 were crossed in 4 x 4 complete diallel fashion. Means, {{coefficients of}} variability, broad sense heritability and genetic advance for various cotton plant traits were calculated. All the characters showed low coefficients of variability except yield <b>of</b> seed <b>cotton</b> and number <b>of</b> <b>bolls</b> per plant. Broad-sense heritability estimates were prominent for number <b>of</b> <b>bolls</b> per plant, boll weight and yield <b>of</b> seed <b>cotton</b> thus suggesting that improvement for these traits {{can be made}} through selection...|$|R
40|$|A 5 x 5 diallel cross {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} have genetic information on yield and yield components. The results of joint regression analysis indicated that data for all the characters were fit for simple additive-dominance model. Vr/Wr graph showed that overdominance type of gene action was operative for number <b>of</b> <b>bolls</b> per plants, yield <b>of</b> seed <b>cotton</b> and lint percentage while additive type of gene action with partial dominance for boll weight. CIM- 443 showed good general combining ability (gca) for number <b>of</b> <b>bolls</b> per plant, yield <b>of</b> seed <b>cotton</b> and <b>boll</b> weight. DPL- 7740 - 424 had also better general combining ability for lint percentage.
