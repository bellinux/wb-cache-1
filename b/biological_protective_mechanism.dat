40|$|Environmental risk {{assessment}} {{is an essential}} step {{in the development of}} solutions for pollution problems and new environmental regulations. An assessment system for environmental risks has been developed in China in recent decades. However, many of the Chinese technical guidelines, standards, and regulations were directly adapted from those of developed countries, and were not based on the Chinese environmental and socioeconomic context. Although existing environmental regulations for pollutants are usually obtained by extrapolations from high-dose toxicological data to low-dose scenarios using linear-non-threshold (LNT) models, toxicologists have argued that J-shaped or inverse J- shaped curves may dominate the dose–response relationships for environmental pollutants at low doses because low exposures stimulate <b>biological</b> <b>protective</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that are ineffective at higher doses. The costs of regulations based on LNT and J-shaped models could therefore be dramatically different. Since economic factors strongly affect the decision-making process, particularly for developing countries, it is time to strengthen basic research to provide more scientific support for Chinese environmental regulations. In this paper, we summarize current Chinese environmental policies and standards and the application of environmental {{risk assessment}} in China, and recommend a more scientific approach to the development of Chinese regulations...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Pregnancy is an {{intriguing}} immunologic phenomenon. In spite of genetic differences, maternal and fetal cells are {{in close contact}} over the whole course of pregnancy with no evidence of either humoral and/or cellular immunologic response of mother to fetus as an allotransplant. The general opinion is that the fundamental <b>protective</b> <b>mechanism</b> must be located locally at the contact-plate, between the maternal and fetal tissues. Immunologic investigations proved the presence of specific systems which block the function of antipaternal maternal antibodies, as well as formation of cytotoxic maternal T-cells to paternal antigens. The system preventing rejection of graft during pregnancy is functioning {{at the level of}} maternal and fetal tissues. The <b>protective</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are coded by genes of MCH region, locus HLA-G. <b>Protective</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the placenta The placenta protects itself against antibody-mediated damage. A high level of complement-regulatory proteins (CD 46, CD 55 and CD 59), being the response to the synthesis of complement-fixing maternal antibodies to paternal antigens and regulation of the placental HLA expression as a preventive reaction of the feto-placental unit to the influence of maternal CTL, are the most important <b>protective</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of placenta. <b>Protective</b> <b>mechanisms</b> shared by the placenta and uterus <b>Protective</b> <b>mechanisms</b> common both for placenta and uterus are as follows: expressions of Fas ligand prevention of infiltration of activated immune cells, regulation of immunosuppression which prevents proliferation of immune cells and high natural immunity (Na cells and macrophages) of the decidua...|$|R

40|$|Acute stress, as bed rest, {{was shown}} to {{increase}} plasma level of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in older, but not in young adults. This increase might represent a <b>protective</b> <b>mechanism</b> towards acute insults in aging subjects. Since computerized cognitive training (CCT) is known to protect brain, herein we evaluated the effect of CCT during bed rest on BDNF, muscle mass, neuromuscular function and metabolic parameters. The subjects that underwent CCT did not show an increase of BDNF after bed rest, and showed an anti-insular modification pattern in metabolism. Neuromuscular function parameters, already shown to beneficiate from CCT, negatively correlated with BDNF in research participants undergoing CCT, while positively correlated in the control group. In conclusion, BDNF increase {{can be interpreted as}} a standardized <b>protective</b> <b>mechanism</b> taking place whenever an insult occurs; it gives low, but consistent preservation of neuromuscular function. CCT, acting as an external <b>protective</b> <b>mechanism,</b> seems to modify this standardized response, avoiding BDNF increase or possibly modifying its time course. Our results suggest the possibility of differential neuroprotective mechanisms among ill and healthy individuals, and the importance of timing in determining the effects of <b>protective</b> <b>mechanisms...</b>|$|R

40|$|Microglia {{mediated}} neuroinflammation is {{a hallmark}} of Parkinson’s disease (PD). It {{has been reported that}} microglia in the brain of PD have both neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects, depending on the microglial activation states. In this review, we will focus on the recent research findings of the neuroprotective role of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in PD. Accumulating new evidences have indicated that the <b>protective</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of microglia may result from its regulation of transrepression pathways via nuclear receptors, anti-inflammatory responses, neuron-microglia crosstalk, histone modification and microRNA regulation. All of these <b>protective</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of microglia orchestrate with each other to repress the production of neurotoxic inflammatory components. Since the detrimental effects of inﬂammation overwhelm the protective effects of microglia during the disease progression of PD, exploring an in-depth understanding of the <b>protective</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of microglia and promoting the transformation of beneficial microglia are urgently important for the treatment of PD...|$|R
40|$|Ischemic {{preconditioning}} is {{the effect}} of brief ischemic episodes which protect the heart from the following more prolonged ischemic episode. This mechanism is effective in younger but not in aged heart. The age-related reduction of ischemic preconditioning has been demonstrated in experimental models and in elderly patients. Preinfarction angina, a clinical equivalent of ischemic preconditioning, reduces mortality in adult but not in elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction. Physical activity or caloric restriction is partially capable to preserve the cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning in the aging heart. More importantly, physical activity and caloric restriction in tandem action completely preserve the <b>protective</b> <b>mechanism</b> of ischemic preconditioning. Accordingly, the <b>protective</b> <b>mechanism</b> of preinfarction angina is preserved in elderly patients with a high grade of physical activity or a low body-mass index.
