5000|$|In 1981, the Wagoneer {{line was}} {{expanded}} to three models. The Custom Wagoneer was the basic model, yet it included a four-speed transmission, free-wheeling hubs, power steering and power front disc brakes, {{as well as}} passenger area carpeting. A new Brougham model added an upgraded interior trim that included woodgrain for the instrument cluster and horn cover, floor mats, power tailgate window, {{as well as the}} [...] "convenience" [...] and [...] "light" [...] packages. The Brougham's exterior included a thin <b>side</b> <b>body</b> scuff <b>moulding</b> with a narrow woodgrain insert, roof rack, as well as bright door and quarter window frames, and a lower tailgate moulding. The Wagoneer Limited was the top-of-the-line with standard Quadra-Trac, automatic transmission, air conditioning, tinted glass, power windows and door locks, cruise control, AM/FM stereo radio, extra quiet insulation, power six-way driver and passenger bucket seats with center armrest, upgraded door panels, leather-wrapped steering wheel, extra thick carpeting, and retractable cargo cover.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addressed}} {{the nature of}} the memory representation for interlimb coordination tasks. For this purpose, the acquisition of a multifrequency (2 : 1) task with the ipsilateral limbs and transfer to the ipsilateral and contralateral <b>body</b> <b>side</b> was examined. In particular, subjects practiced a 2 : 1 coordination pattern whereby the right arm moved twice as fast as the right leg, or vice versa. Subsequently, they transferred the practiced 2 : 1 task to three different conditions: (1) the converse partner (i. e., the slow-moving limb had to move fast, and vice versa) at the ipsilateral <b>body</b> <b>side,</b> and (2) the identical and (3) converse 2 : 1 pattern at the contralateral <b>body</b> <b>side.</b> Findings revealed positive transfer of the identical and converse 2 : 1 pattern to the contralateral <b>body</b> <b>side.</b> However, no transfer of the learned pattern to its converse partner at the same <b>body</b> <b>side</b> was revealed. We propose a new memory representation model for coordination patterns, composed of an effector-independent and effector-specific component (dual-layer model). It is hypothesized that the general movement goal (i. e., moving one limb twice as fast as the other) constitutes the abstract, higher-level representation that may account for positive contralateral transfer. Conversely, the effector-specific component contains task-specific lower-level muscle synergies that are acquired through practice, prohibiting positive transfer when shifting task allocation within the same effectors. These findings are consistent with recent neuroscientific evidence for neuroplastic changes in distributed brain areas. status: publishe...|$|R

Most of these cars were automatics and {{nearly all of them}} sported a naturally aspirated engine.

40|$|Although tactile {{representations}} of the two <b>body</b> <b>sides</b> are initially segregated into opposite hemispheres of the brain, behavioural interactions between <b>body</b> <b>sides</b> exist and can be revealed under conditions of tactile double simultaneous stimulation (DSS) at the hands. Here we examined to what extent vision can affect <b>body</b> <b>side</b> segregation in touch. To this aim, we changed hand-related visual input while participants performed a go/no-go task to detect a tactile stimulus delivered to one target finger (e. g., right index), stimulated alone or with a concurrent non-target finger either on the same hand (e. g., right middle finger) or {{on the other hand}} (e. g., left index finger = homologous; left middle finger = non-homologous). Across experiments, the two hands were visible or occluded from view (Experiment 1), images of the two hands were either merged using a morphing technique (Experiment 2), or were shown in a compatible vs incompatible position with respect to the actual posture (Experiment 3). Overall, the results showed reliable interference effects of DSS, as compared to target-only stimulation. This interference varied as a function of which non-target finger was stimulated, and emerged both within and between hands. These results imply that the competition between tactile events is not clearly segregated across <b>body</b> <b>sides.</b> Crucially, non-informative vision of the hand affected overall tactile performance only when a visual/proprioceptive conflict was present, while neither congruent nor morphed hand vision affected tactile DSS interference. This suggests that DSS operates at a tactile processing stage in which interactions between <b>body</b> <b>sides</b> can occur regardless of the available visual input from the body...|$|R

40|$|Functional imaging {{studies have}} shown that elderly {{individuals}} activate widespread additional brain networks, compared to young subjects, when performing motor tasks. However, the parameters that effect this unique neural activation, including the spatial distribution of this activation across hemispheres, are still largely unknown. Here, we examined the effect of task complexity and <b>body</b> <b>side</b> on activation differences between older and younger adults while performing cyclical flexion-extension movements of the ipsilateral hand and foot. In particular, easy (isodirectional) and more difficult (non-isodirectional) coordination patterns were performed with either the left or right <b>body</b> <b>side</b> at a self-selected, comfortable rate. Even in the absence of imposed pacing the older group activated a larger brain network, suggestive of increased attentional deployment for monitoring the spatial relationships between the simultaneously moving segments and enhanced sensory processing and integration. Evidence of age-dependent underactivation was also found in contralateral M 1, SMA and bilateral putamen, possibly reflecting a functional decline of the basal ganglia-mesial cortex pathway in the older group. An ANOVA model revealed significant main effects of task complexity and <b>body</b> <b>side.</b> However the interaction of these factors with age did not reach significance. Consequently, we conclude that under self-paced conditions, task complexity and <b>body</b> <b>side</b> did not have a modulatory effect on age-related brain activation. status: publishe...|$|R
