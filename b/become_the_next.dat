5|$|Nine Inch Nails {{front man}} Trent Reznor {{announced}} in 2007 that the band had completed its contractual obligations to its record label, Interscope Records, and {{would no longer}} be working with the company. Reznor also revealed that Nine Inch Nails would likely distribute music independently. Since the announcement, Nine Inch Nails released the 36-track instrumental album Ghosts I–IV in March 2008 on Reznor's independent label The Null Corporation. After the release of Ghosts I–IV, Reznor began writing and recording what would <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> full-length album, The Slip.|$|E
5|$|Pope Vitalian {{wrote to}} Oswiu after Wighard's death, and {{this letter is}} {{preserved}} by Bede in his Historia Ecclesiastica. In the letter, which also mentions that a messenger from Oswiu had been among the companions of the archbishop-elect, the pope apologises {{that he has been}} unable to find a successor to Wighard yet. Wighard's death in Rome allowed Vitalian the opportunity to choose his successor, and Vitalian chose his friend Theodore of Tarsus to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> archbishop.|$|E
500|$|Marx defined capital as [...] "dead labour which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labour, {{and lives}} the more, the more labour it sucks". Werner Herzog, in his Nosferatu the Vampyre, gives this {{political}} interpretation an extra ironic twist when protagonist Jonathon Harker, a middle-class solicitor, <b>becomes</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> vampire; {{in this way}} <b>the</b> capitalist bourgeois <b>becomes</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> parasitic class.|$|R

5|$|CMLL has {{declared}} the championship vacant on two separate occasions, {{which meant that}} there was no champion for a period of time. Sometimes, a championship is vacated due to an injury to the reigning champion, or when a champion stoped working for the promotion, {{but in the case of}} the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship, there was a storyline reason behind it being declared vacant the first time. In late 2013 the light heavyweight champion Rush was working a long-running storyline rivalry with El Terrible. When El Terrible won the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship, CMLL decided to enhance the rivalry by having Rush voluntarily give up the light heavyweight championship in order to receive a CMLL World Heavyweight Championship match against El Terrible. This allowed CMLL to advance the storyline as well as move the championship off Rush without having Rush lose a match, allowing Rey Escorpión to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> champion. The second vacancy started on May 22, 2017 when CMLL fired the then-champion Máscara.|$|E
5|$|Castlevania was rebooted {{due to the}} team's {{concern over}} the poor sales in their latest Castlevania games. The team wished to expand the franchise's fanbase with this game. A number of prototypes in {{parallel}} development competed to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Castlevania title. Konami told MercurySteam the game would be an original intellectual property (IP) {{when it was first}} greenlit as a Castlevania title. Konami eventually asked them to cease work on Lords of Shadow while it was still in its early stages, until David Cox showed the Japanese senior management the game and was offered help by video game designer Hideo Kojima. Konami then chose the pitch for it as the next Castlevania entry. The original concept for the game was to remake the first Castlevania starring Simon Belmont, but it was later decided to make a reboot of the franchise. Lords of Shadow still drew inspiration from earlier titles in the series, most notably Castlevania for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Super Castlevania IV.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt {{was raised}} from Knight Commander to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 2008–2009 New Year Honours List. His tenure as CGS expired in August 2008 {{and he was}} succeeded {{for the last time}} by Sir David Richards. The {{government}} took the unusual decision to extend the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup as CDS, rather than promote one of the outgoing service chiefs. Thus all three, including Dannatt, retired, amid claims that Dannatt's potential promotion to CDS had been personally vetoed by Prime Minister Gordon Brown. His last act as CGS was to nominate Nick Houghton to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff.|$|E

5|$|On 11 May 2010, {{two days}} {{after the end of the}} 2009–10 season, West Ham {{announced}} the termination of Zola's contract with immediate effect. On 3 June 2010, Avram Grant signed a four-year deal to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> manager of West Ham subject to a work permit. West Ham's form continued to be poor with the team seldom outside the relegation zone, placing Grant's future as manager under serious doubt. A 4–0 Football League Cup quarter-final win over Manchester United was an otherwise bright spot in a disappointing season. West Ham's form in the Premier League did not affect their form in the two domestic cups. The Hammers reached the semi-final of the League Cup before being eliminated by eventual winners Birmingham City as well as the quarter final of the FA cup before a 2–1 defeat at Stoke City.|$|E
5|$|Opus Dei's highest {{assembled}} {{bodies are}} the General Congresses, {{which are usually}} convened once every eight years. There are separate congresses {{for the men and}} women's branch of Opus Dei. The General Congresses are made up of members appointed by the Prelate, and are responsible for advising him about the prelature's future. The men's General Congress also elects the Prelate from a list of candidates chosen by their female counterparts. After the death of a Prelate, a special elective General Congress is convened. The women nominate their preferred candidates for the prelate and is voted upon by the men to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Prelate—an appointment that must be confirmed by the Pope.|$|E
5|$|The company faced a {{difficult}} situation again in 1967 when {{the total number of}} vehicles produced was just 381 units. At the beginning of 1968 VAT fired 40 of the 400 employees. Vanaja had its staunch customer base and the vehicles were generally well regarded but the overall market share remained low; in 1963 just 4–5% of the newly registered heavy lorries in Finland were Vanajas. The highly customised production had led to an excessive diversity of models, which made spare part supply difficult. Moreover, the customising presumably took resources away from technical development work. There was no change for the better although the company introduced its modern forward control model B6-76 which was expected to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> volume model.|$|E

5|$|Villani and the Buonaccorsi {{had gained}} an unsavory {{reputation}} {{as early as}} 1331, when Villani was tried (and cleared) for barratry {{for his part in}} building the new third circuit of walls around Florence. Charles, Duke of Calabria had granted the Buonaccorsi the right to tax three of the six districts of Florence, which did not help Villani's reputation amongst his fellow citizens. In early June 1342, partners and agents of the Buonaccorsi suddenly fled Florence, Avignon, and Naples, following bankruptcy proceedings by creditors, nearly all of whom had deposits in the Buonaccorsi bank. Like other Florentine bankers and companies having difficulty with bankruptcy at the time, in September 1342 they supported the move to invite WalterVI of Brienne to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> signor of Florence. Walter later suspended all legal actions taken against the Buonaccorsi and other company partners for nearly a year.|$|E
5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker {{will live}} somewhere between 14–16 days. The oldest wasp to be {{observed}} in a natural colony was 102 days old. Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers. There has been some variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur {{because of the presence of}} different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, Gannon was one {{of three}} {{candidates}} reported to have impressed in interviews for the vacant Port Vale job, making him one of the favourites for the position. However, Paul Simpson's dismissal at Stockport County led to hopes of a return to the club for some County fans. Therefore, he was installed as the bookies favourite to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Port Vale manager, and also the bookie's favourite for the Stockport job. Gannon was confirmed as the manager of Port Vale on 6 January 2011, succeeding Micky Adams {{at the helm of the}} promotion chasing club, signing a contract that lasted until summer 2012. Saying that finishing outside of the top seven would be a failure, the Cheshire-based manager's first task after 'burying the hatchet' with Gareth Owen was to look for a new striker. Two weeks into his reign club captain Tommy Fraser left the club by mutual consent, as signs of what would be an unhappy relationship between club and manager quickly came to the surface. Gannon then brought in Romaine Sawyers and Kayleden Brown on loan from West Bromwich Albion, Jay O'Shea on loan from Birmingham City, Exodus Geohaghon on loan from Peterborough United, and striker Tom Pope on loan from Rotherham United.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the plot}} of Lunar: The Silver Star was written by novelist Kei Shigema, and {{involves}} a world of high fantasy and with emphasis on folklore and legend. The game begins in the small mountain town of Burg, where a young Alex frequently visits the monument to the fallen hero Dyne, his idol. At the behest of Ramus, eager son of the town mayor, Ramus and Alex embark on their first real adventure, with Alex's adopted sister Luna and their talking flying pet Nall, to the mysterious Dragon's Cave {{in search of a}} valuable diamond. Making their way through the cavern, the group meets Quark, an aged dragon who senses great potential in Alex, and urges him to complete the trials of other dragons to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Dragonmaster, champion of the Goddess Althena, and protector of the world. Quark shows an interest in Luna as well, remarking that she has a familiar aura about her. Obtaining the diamond from Quark, Ramus finds he cannot sell it in Burg, and must travel to the major trade city of Meribia to claim his fortune. The group then makes their way to Saith, a small port town to the south, where Luna leaves the group to stay with Alex's family.|$|E
5|$|Ralph {{suffered}} a stroke on 11 July 1119 as he was removing his vestments after celebrating Mass. From then until his death, Ralph was partially paralysed and unable to speak clearly. He was still involved in decision making and, in 1120, he agreed to King Alexander I of Scotland's suggestion that Eadmer <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Bishop of St Andrew's. Ralph {{was one of the}} lords consulted about the remarriage of Henry I to Adeliza of Leuven at London in 1121. He also successfully asserted his right to celebrate the king's new marriage, over attempts by Roger of Salisbury to officiate instead. Due to the damage from the stroke, Ralph was unable to perform the ceremony but, when Roger made an attempt to do so, Ralph successfully insisted on choosing the officiant and William Giffard the Bishop of Winchester performed the marriage. Ralph died on 20 October 1122, at Canterbury. He was buried in the nave of Canterbury Cathedral on 23 October 1122. His nephew, John, was a clerk under Ralph, and later Ralph appointed him Archdeacon of Canterbury. After Ralph's death, John was elected to the see of Rochester.|$|E
