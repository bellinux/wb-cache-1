40|$|Do {{victims of}} <b>bullying</b> {{tend to be}} also cyber <b>bullies?</b> Do cyber <b>bullies</b> lack empathic responsiveness? These {{questions}} are discussed controversially [1, 24, 27]. In the present study 2, 070 students of Luxembourg secondary schools completed an online questionnaire that included a German version of the Cyber <b>bullying</b> questionnaire [24] and a newly developed scale on empathy. To further {{the understanding of the}} relationship between cyber <b>bullying</b> and <b>bullying,</b> frequency analyses (chi square) were calculated. The present findings support the hypotheses (a) that there is a link between traditional <b>bullying</b> and cyber <b>bullying,</b> (b) that <b>bullies</b> tend to be cyber <b>bullies,</b> and (c) that victims of <b>bullying</b> also tend to be victims of cyber <b>bullying.</b> In addition, students who hear of, or witness acts of traditional <b>bullying,</b> have a significantly higher probability of hearing of cyber <b>bullying.</b> Traditional victims also tended do be cyber <b>bullies.</b> Furthermore, ANOVAs indicated significant differences between cyber <b>bullies</b> and non-cyber <b>bullies.</b> Cyber <b>bullies</b> demonstrated less empathic responsiveness.

40|$|Abstract The main aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether an {{assessment}} of implicit <b>bullying</b> attitudes could add to the prediction of <b>bullying</b> behavior after controlling for explicit <b>bullying</b> attitudes. Primary school children (112 boys and 125 girls, M age= 11 years, 5 months) completed two newly developed measures of implicit <b>bullying</b> attitudes (a general Implicit Association Test on <b>bullying</b> and a movie-primed specific IAT on <b>bullying),</b> an explicit <b>bullying</b> attitude measure, and self reported, peer reported, and teacher rated <b>bullying</b> behavior. While explicit <b>bullying</b> attitudes predicted <b>bullying</b> behavior, implicit attitudes did not. However, a significant interaction between implicit and explicit <b>bullying</b> attitudes indicated that in children with relatively positive explicit attitudes, implicit <b>bullying</b> attitudes were important predictors of <b>bullying</b> behavior. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed...|$|R

Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a <b>bully.</b> Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school <b>bully,</b> Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should <b>bully</b> him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E
5|$|The Waterworks River {{underwent}} considerable {{change over}} the years. In 1850, it left the channel of the Old River Lee much further to the north, to the south-west of Temple Mills railway depot. It was called Lead Mills Stream at this point. Near Temple Mills bridge, now on the A12 road, Channelsea River split off. The two channels ran parallel to the Old River Lee, before Channelsea River turned to the south-east. There was another small connection between the Old River Lee and the Waterworks River called <b>Bully</b> Fence, where the northern Channelsea River is shown on modern maps. By 1870, it was called Waterworks River {{as far north as}} Temple Mills depot, and by 1896, its present connection to the old river near to Carpenters Road had been established. Twenty years later, the northern Waterworks River rejoined the Lee at <b>Bully</b> Fence, and the section between there and Carpenters Road had been filled in. At some point, the connection at <b>Bully</b> Fence became the main source for the Channelsea River, although the 1953/66 map still shows it connected to the remnants of the system to the north, for drainage. Administrative boundaries still follow the northern course of the Waterworks River.|$|E
