5|$|It {{was written}} in the L.A. sun on an {{afternoon}} with my friend David Poe. We were talking about how you sometimes know that you would be better at love if only you were older. But you can't rush old. You have to be young and dumb and let time do its thing <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the experience you need to handle love right.|$|E
500|$|Confederate general Jubal Early began {{a series}} of assaults in the North that {{threatened}} the Capital. During Early's raid on Washington, D.C. in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain Oliver Wendell Holmes shouted at him, [...] "Get down, you damn fool, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> shot!" [...] After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.|$|E
500|$|Brooks's 1923 self-portrait has a grimmer tone. Brookswho also {{designed}} her own clothespainted {{herself in a}} tailored riding coat, gloves, and top hat. Behind her is a ruined building rendered in gray and black, underneath a slate-colored sky. The only spots of strong color are her lipstick and the red ribbon of the Legion of Honor that she wears on her lapel, recalling the Red Cross insignia in The Cross of France. [...] Her eyes are shaded by the brim of her hat, so that, according to one critic, [...] "she's watching you <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> close enough to look at her. She's not passively inviting your approach; she's deciding whether you're worth bothering with." ...|$|E

500|$|Wintour {{is often}} {{described}} as emotionally distant by those who have come to know her well, even her close friends. [...] "At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became 'Anna Wintour,' at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public," [...] wrote The Guardian. [...] "I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. You have to walk about a mile into the office <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to her desk and I'm sure it's intentional," [...] Coddington says. [...] "I don't find her to be accessible to people she doesn't need to be accessible to," [...] agrees Vogue publisher Tom Florio.|$|E
500|$|... "Ocean" [...] was {{the first}} of two promotional singles to be {{released}} from Silver Eye, with the other being [...] "Moon in Your Mouth" [...] which was released two weeks later; the song was distributed to digital retailers on 10 March 2017 through Mute Records following its initial debut on Billboards official website. It was written and produced by members Alison Goldfrapp and William Owen Gregory with The Haxan Cloak and John Congleton serving as additional producers. While creating material for Silver Eye, the duo had trouble writing songs that they actually enjoyed; Goldfrapp claimed that [...] "it always takes about three months to write all the rubbish out of your system <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> something you like". Along with the announcement of [...] "Ocean" [...] as a promotional single, tickets for a promotional tour for Silver Eye were made available for purchase, with show legs in Europe and the United States.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} Nirvana's debut album Bleach was {{inspired}} by a harm reduction poster aimed at heroin injection users, which stated [...] "Bleach your works [...] <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> stoned". The poster was released by a US state health department which was trying to reduce AIDS transmission caused through sharing used needles. Alice in Chains' song [...] "God Smack" [...] includes the line [...] "stick your arm for some real fun", a reference to injecting heroin. Seattle musicians known to use heroin included Cobain, who was using [...] "heroin when he shot himself in the head"; [...] "Andrew Wood of Mother Love Bone [...] overdosed on heroin in 1990"; [...] "Stefanie Sargent of 7 Year Bitch died of an overdose of the same opiate in 1992... Layne Staley of Alice in Chains [...] publicly detailed his battles with heroin...". Mike Starr of Alice in Chains [...] and Jonathan Melvoin from The Smashing Pumpkins also died from heroin. After Cobain's death, his [...] "...widow, singer Courtney Love, characterized Seattle as a drug mecca, where heroin is easier to get than in San Francisco or Los Angeles." ...|$|E

Behavioural change {{interventions}} appear to work best when they're part of a package of regulation and fiscal measures ... all politicians love quick fixes ... {{one of the problems}} with all of this is if you really want to change people's behaviour it takes a very long time ... you have to look at a 20- to 25-year span <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a full change of behaviour.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Kramer was the {{catalyst}} {{in the founding}} of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), a direct action protest organization that chose government agencies and corporations as targets to publicize lack of treatment and funding for people with AIDS. ACT UP was formed at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Services Center in New York City. Kramer was asked to speak as part of a rotating speaker series, and his well-attended speech focused on action to fight AIDS. He began by having two-thirds of the room stand up, and told them they would be dead in five years. Kramer reiterated the points introduced in his essay [...] "1,112 and Counting": [...] "If my speech tonight doesn't scare the shit out of you, we're in real trouble. If what you're hearing doesn't rouse you to anger, fury, rage, and action, gay men will have no future here on earth. How long does it take <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> angry and fight back?" [...] Their first target became the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which Kramer accused in The New York Times of neglecting badly needed medication for HIV-infected Americans.|$|E
2500|$|Porch was a {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman. He did {{not appear}} in first-class cricket for Oxford University, but when Somerset played the university side in 1895, he played for the county team, scoring 11 and 42. At {{the end of the}} university term, he became a fairly regular player for Somerset {{in the second half of}} the 1895 season. In his third first-class match, against Essex at Taunton, he scored an unbeaten 85, and this was to be the highest score of his cricket career; he was upstaged in the match, however, by the Essex total of 692, which was the highest total for the county for 95 years until beaten in 1990. Even that Essex record was upstaged in Porch's next match for Somerset at Taunton, though, when Lancashire made 801, with Archie MacLaren setting a world record for the highest first-class score by making 424. In his obituary published in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1964, Porch was quoted, apparently without irony, as [...] "a great believer in the importance of fielding". The obituary says that his maxim was: [...] "Save six fours when the other side is batting, and you have 24 to your name <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> off the mark, though it's not in the score-book." ...|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Associated Press, Knowles said that one of the hardest parts of the tour was [...] "squeezing a decade's worth of hits into a two-hour show" [...] and performing the songs in designer Thierry Mugler's [...] "elaborate" [...] costumes. She elaborated: [...] "I'm never gonna go onstage or do a video and not work until my feet are blistered, and until I'm basically, I can't walk any more. I always give, and I do that because I know how lucky I am, to do my job." [...] She also promised that the tour would be more emotional than The Beyoncé Experience because of the [...] "real raw and more sensitive" [...] nature of the I Am... portion of the double album. Knowles also expressed frustration that snippets of the show appeared online after the first shows on the opening leg, [...] "ruining" [...] some of the surprise of the concert experience and possibly convincing some fans not to attend. She went on saying: [...] "It's great because people can get a little sneak peek and say, 'Oh, I wanna come to the show,' or, 'I don't wanna go to that show'... and I'm fans of people so I go on there and check it out too. But you put so much of your heart and time into the wardrobe... it's kind of unfortunate that people can see the show months <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into their city, but that's life." [...] French designer Thierry Mugler collaborated with Knowles on the wardrobe and had a creative advisor role, as he also contributed to designing the whole show, from lighting to choreography, production and directing three sequences for the concert. As a creative advisor, Mugler stated about the show: ...|$|E
