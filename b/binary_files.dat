25|$|Usenet was {{originally}} created to distribute text content encoded in the 7-bit ASCII character set. With {{the help of}} programs that encode 8-bit values into ASCII, it became practical to distribute <b>binary</b> <b>files</b> as content. Binary posts, due to their size and often-dubious copyright status, were in time restricted to specific newsgroups, {{making it easier for}} administrators to allow or disallow the traffic.|$|E

25|$|Before {{commercial}} Internet access became common, {{these networks}} of BBSes provided {{regional and international}} e-mail and message bases. Some even provided gateways, such as UFGATE, by which members could send/receive e-mail to/from the Internet via UUCP, and many FidoNet discussion groups were shared via gateway to Usenet. Elaborate schemes allowed users to download <b>binary</b> <b>files,</b> search gopherspace, and interact with distant programs, all using plain text e-mail.|$|E
25|$|The Version tab that {{appeared}} for <b>binary</b> <b>files</b> with version information in Windows XP and the Summary tab {{that appeared}} for all files on NTFS volumes have been combined {{into a single}} Details tab. If a Property handler is installed, the Details property sheet allows editing file metadata similar to the Details pane. Windows Explorer has built-in ability to remove any extra metadata associated with the file (Remove Properties and Personal Information).|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of the Solaris code base to be open sourced was the Solaris Dynamic Tracing {{facility}} (commonly known as DTrace), a tool that aids in the analysis, debugging, and tuning of applications and systems. DTrace was released under the CDDL on January 25, 2005 on the newly launched opensolaris.org website. The bulk of the Solaris system code was released on June 14, 2005. There remains some system code that is not open sourced, and is available only as pre-compiled <b>binary</b> <b>files.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} other {{operating}} systems, OpenBSD provides a package management system for easy installation {{and management of}} programs which {{are not part of}} the base operating system. Packages are <b>binary</b> <b>files</b> which are extracted, managed and removed using the package tools. On OpenBSD, the source of packages is the ports system, a collection of Makefiles and other infrastructure required to create packages. In OpenBSD, the ports and base operating system are developed and released together for each version: this means that the ports or packages released with, for example, 4.6 are not suitable for use with 4.5 and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Fortran {{sequential}} unformatted files {{created with}} one endianness usually cannot be read {{on a system}} using the other endianness because Fortran usually implements a record (defined as the data written by a single Fortran statement) as data preceded and succeeded by count fields, which are integers equal {{to the number of}} bytes in the data. An attempt to read such file on a system of the other endianness then results in a run-time error, because the count fields are incorrect. This problem can be avoided by writing out sequential <b>binary</b> <b>files</b> as opposed to sequential unformatted.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{editions of}} the diff program were {{designed}} for line comparisons of text files expecting the newline character to delimit lines. [...] By the 1980s, support for <b>binary</b> <b>files</b> resulted in {{a shift in the}} application's design and implementation.|$|E

2500|$|Typically, diff {{is used to}} {{show the}} changes between two {{versions}} of the same file. Modern implementations also support <b>binary</b> <b>files.</b> The output is called a [...] "diff", or a patch, since the output can be applied with the Unix program patch. [...] The output of similar file comparison utilities are also called a [...] "diff"; like {{the use of the word}} [...] "grep" [...] for describing the act of searching, the word diff became a generic term for calculating data difference and the results thereof.|$|E

50|$|<b>Binary</b> <b>files</b> {{are usually}} {{thought of as}} being a {{sequence}} of bytes, which means the binary digits (bits) are grouped in eights. <b>Binary</b> <b>files</b> typically contain bytes that are intended to be interpreted as something other than text characters. Compiled computer programs are typical examples; indeed, compiled applications are sometimes referred to, particularly by programmers, as binaries. But <b>binary</b> <b>files</b> can also mean that they contain images, sounds, compressed versions of other files, etc.—in short, any type of file content whatsoever.|$|E
