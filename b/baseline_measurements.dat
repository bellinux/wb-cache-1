40|$|Spatial {{baseline}} determination is a {{key technology}} for interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) missions. Based on the intersatellite <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement</b> using dual-frequency GPS, errors induced by InSAR spatial <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement</b> are studied in detail. The classifications and characters of errors are analyzed, and models for errors are set up. The simulations of single factor and total error sources are selected to evaluate the impacts of errors on spatial <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement.</b> Single factor simulations are {{used to analyze the}} impact of the error of a single type, while total error sources simulations are used to analyze the impacts of error sources induced by GPS <b>measurement,</b> <b>baseline</b> transformation, and the entire spatial <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement,</b> respectively. Simulation results show that errors related to GPS measurement are the main error sources for the spatial baseline determination, and carrier phase noise of GPS observation and fixing error of GPS receiver antenna are main factors of errors related to GPS measurement. In addition, according to the error values listed in this paper, 1 [*]mm level InSAR spatial baseline determination should be realized...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{transition}} from preclinical to clinical training {{is perceived as}} stressful with a high workload being the main difficulty. To ease this transition, we implemented a dual learning year, where just-in-time skills training and clerkships alternated. Aims: To {{examine the effect of}} the dual learning year on students' stress and perceptions of workload and skills level, and to compare these data with a <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement</b> from a curriculum in which skills training was provided in advance of clerkships. Method: During the first Master year, students completed four rotations in which 5 weeks of skills training and 5 -week clerkships alternated. In the second clerkship week of each rotation, students (n = 476) completed questionnaires measuring their experienced workload, perceived skills level and stress. Analysis of variance was used for trend analysis and to determine differences with the <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement</b> (n 83). Results: During the dual learning year, 'experienced workload' decreased (F(1, 471) = 9. 408, p < 50. 01), 'perceived skills level' increased (F(1, 471) = 94. 202, p < 0. 001) and stress decreased (F(1, 471) = 3. 309, p < 0. 10). 'Experienced workload' was lower (F(5, 553) = 7. 599, p < 0. 001) and 'perceived skills level' was comparable to the <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement.</b> Conclusions: Compared to the <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement</b> and the results of earlier studies on transition difficulties, alternating just-in-time skills training and clerkships seem to ease the {{transition from}} preclinical to clinical training...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a set of}} performance metrics and a performance measurement system developed {{for the evaluation of}} roadway departure warning systems. The work is part of an effort by the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA) to develop quantitative measures of performance for the evaluation of highway safety systems. The work is also {{part of an effort to}} promote dual-use technologies between the Department of Transportation and the Department of Defense. The Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology undertook the development of the performance measurement system. The approach for quantitative evaluation rests on establishing a <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement</b> of roadway departure that is of higher accuracy than the warning system under test. The output of the warning system is then compared to the <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement</b> to produce a quantitative measure of performance. The <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement</b> system is installed on a vehicle with the warning system. The baseline system achieves high accuracy by aiming a calibrated camera onto an area of the road adjacent to the vehicle. As the vehicle is driven and roadway departure maneuvers are performed, the output of the video camera, the vehicle's position (from a global positioning system and inertial sensors), and the output of the warning system are synchronized and digitally recorded. After a vehicle run is complete, a suite of software is used to automatically analyze the baseline video data to determine roadway departure. Since the video and other data remain available after the vehicle run, an operator (to establish the credibility of the <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement)</b> can verify a roadway departure. Also, the data can be analyzed to provide insight into the c [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|University of California, Los Angeles: As {{its first}} initiative, UCLA EH&S's Laboratory Energy Efficiency Program (LEEP) jointly {{sponsored}} a {{competition with the}} Alliance to Save Energy's PowerSave Campus Program to encourage reduced fume hood sash heights in research laboratories. The first fume hood competition {{took place in the}} Molecular Sciences Building (MSB) during Fall 2008 and included about 230 fume hoods. Overall, the competition saw a 40% sash height decrease from 13.4” to 8” (as shown by competition behavior and the long-term followup). In order to identify the lasting, long-term behavior change, LEEP and UCLA PowerSave Campus conducted follow-up audits each month after the competition. Sash heights were measured throughout one week, using the same method for recording <b>baseline</b> <b>measurements.</b> The follow-up data showed that MSB’s new average sash height was 7.8”—a 5.6” decrease from <b>baseline</b> <b>measurements.</b> Ultimately, this 40% reduction translates into an annual estimated savings of 1,415,278 lbs of CO2 emissions and $149,730.

40|$|Background: Adaptation to {{changing}} health presents {{a challenge to}} measuring change in quality of life (QoL). Previous {{studies have shown that}} different methods for measuring change yield different results, but it is unclear which method provides a more valid measurement of change. We investigated which of 3 commonly used methods for measuring change in QoL yielded the strongest associations with clinical measures of change in health status. Methods: A total of 268 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - 1 -infected patients starting highly active antiretroviral therapy completed QoL measures at baseline and after 36 weeks. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between change in QoL according to a prospective baseline and prospective follow-up <b>measurement,</b> a retrospective <b>baseline</b> and prospective follow-up measurement, or retrospective transition questions and change in CD 4 -cell count, plasma viral-load, body mass index, and hemoglobin concentration. Results: Patients evaluated their QoL significantly worse on the retrospective than on the prospective <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement</b> (P < 0. 01). These results may indicate that patients' reference value by which they evaluate their QoL changed over time, which would invalidate prospective serial QoL <b>measurements.</b> The retrospective <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement</b> method yielded strongest associations with clinical measures of change (P = 0. 02 to P < 0. 01). Distinguishing between the change inferred from the conventional prospective and the retrospective <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement</b> method was meaningful because the prospective method did not lead to changes that would be considered clinically significant, whereas the retrospective <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement</b> method did. Conclusions: A method for measuring change in QoL incorporating a retrospective baseline-measurement showed strongest associations with change in clinical indicators of health status, suggesting a more valid measurement of change in QoL than a conventional prospective method...|$|R

50|$|Regular {{physical}} activity {{is reported to}} decrease markers of inflammation, although the correlation is imperfect and seems to reveal differing results contingent upon training intensity. For instance, while <b>baseline</b> <b>measurements</b> of circulating inflammatory markers {{do not seem to}} differ greatly between healthy trained and untrained adults, long-term training may help reduce chronic low-grade inflammation. On the other hand, levels of the anti-inflammatory myokine IL-6 (interleukin 6) remained elevated longer into the recovery period following an acute bout of exercise in patients with inflammatory diseases, relative to the recovery of healthy controls. It may well be that low-intensity training can reduce resting pro-inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6), while moderate-intensity training has milder and less-established anti-inflammatory benefits. There is a strong relationship between exhaustive exercise and chronic low-grade inflammation. Marathon running may enhance IL-6 levels as much as 100 times over normal and increases total leuckocyte count and neturophil mobilization.|$|E
