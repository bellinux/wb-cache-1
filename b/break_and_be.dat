25|$|Daniel sells one of {{the houses}} from the estate, and Paul gives him a job as a salesman. Imogen voices her {{concerns}} about Daniel's changing behaviour, after he convinces Nate to buy a house knowing that certain amenities will not be built. Imogen tells Nate the truth and she and Daniel break up. Daniel also falls out with Paul when he admits to leaking Paul's files to the media. Daniel sees Paul receiving a loan from Dimato for Paul's new business venture. Paul tells Daniel to leave town, which he does without revealing what he knows. He returns with a new hair cut and wants to work at Lassiter's again. Julie Quill agrees to employ him. Daniel and Imogen eventually get back together, but when he works extra hours, she becomes dissatisfied and develops feelings for Tyler. She admits this to Daniel, who decides they take a <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> free to date other people, despite Imogen insisting she would never have acted on her attraction to Tyler. Josh tries to convince Daniel to reconsider the break-up, but Daniel responds by criticising him for his failures as a father, before the hotel boiler explodes, trapping them both under a column. Despite knowing the column is the only thing keeping him from haemorrhaging to death, Josh asks Karl to lift it to save Daniel. Imogen later tells Daniel that Josh died to save him, and they reunite. Daniel is discharged after undergoing surgery. Imogen receives a job offer in Los Angeles and she accepts. Daniel offers to quit his job and go with her. When Imogen mentions spouses can apply for a visa, Daniel proposes and she accepts. Daniel's younger sister Madison (Sarah Ellen) arrives to check up on him on behalf of their parents. A judge grants Daniel and Imogen an expedited marriage license and they decide to marry in secret. However, Imogen's parents interrupt the ceremony and convince Daniel and Imogen to get married at their home in front of their family and friends. After the wedding, Daniel and Imogen leave Erinsborough for Brisbane to see Daniel's parents, before going to Los Angeles.|$|E

If you yearn for it in the winter, you are a fool."There was no real consensus, at least among surviving Roman texts and epitaphs, of what happened to a person after death or the existence of an afterlife. Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia claims that most people are of the opinion that after death one returns to the non-sensing state that occurred before birth but admits, however scornfully, {{that there are people who}} believe in the immortality of the soul. Seneca the Younger seems to be less consistent, arguing both sides, indicating that death brings about utter annihilation while also talking about some survival of the spirit after it escapes from the prison of the body. Tacitus at the end of Agricola takes the opposite opinion to Pliny, and claims that the wise believe the spirit does not die with the body, although he may be specifically referring to the pious [...] - which harkens to the mythological idea of Elysium. It is important to keep in mind that these are the opinions of a select few well-educated elite males and may not be characteristic of all of Roman views.|$|E

40|$|The {{suggested}} {{link between}} fibropapillomatosis (FP) in Hawai'ian marine turtles and non-native macroalgae is indeed very interesting. As {{mentioned in the}} Introduction to the present article, FP became a problem for Hawai'ian green turtles only in the 1980 s, incidentally when the same problem emerged among marine turtles in Florida. I always wondered how an epidemic could start-off simultaneously at two geographic locations as far apart as Hawai'i and Florida. But then, I stumbled over some statements of Celia M. Smith, Professor of Botany at the University of Hawai’i, who testified on April 15, 2005, regarding the impact of marine invasive algae before the US House of Representatives. Among others, she mentioned that in the 1970 s various species of exotic algae were introduced from the Philippines and the Caribbean to Hawai'ian waters. There were both legal and illegal introductions. Most often, the algae were placed in pens on the reef adjacent to the Hawai'ian Institute of Marine Biology in Kaneohe Bay. Citation: "… Water motion in that region was sufficient for parts of the plants to <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> carried off the reef, eventually allowing for the escape of these algae to other regions of Kaneohe Bay. …". Moreover, she mentioned that the red alga Hypnea musciformis, which is specifically mentioned in the present article, readily spread from there to other Hawai'ian islands and posed a particular problem for Maui. (Kaneohe Bay and Maui mentioned in the present article as most highly infested with FP-cases. ...|$|E

40|$|Urban {{forests are}} {{important}} for people to get at <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> able to relax in a stressful world. Several studies show that we feel better through being out in the forest and historically this was the normal environment for us. As a result of population growth and urbanization we tend to spend less time in nature nowadays than before. Due to this development urban forests have become a central role in our society as a place where people can fulfill their needs and interests. The management of the urban forest is therefore important, especially for municipalities that own forest which is supposed to be of benefit to local residents. Falköpings municipality owns approximately 260 hectares of forest in the popular and most visited recreational area along Mösseberg’s southern slope. It has been a desire to develop a recreation plan for this area and this is the cause for this master thesis. The thesis is a collaboration between the Municipality of Falköping and Southern Swedish Forest Research Centre, Alnarp. The work is divided into a result part and an application part. The result part includes a literature review, a recreation value analysis and a smaller survey of interests groups operating in the recreational area of Mösseberg. The result section is the basis for the management proposals and guidelines presented in the application part, which are specific to the urban forest on Mösseberg. The analysis of recreation versus timber production values was performed by using two recreational studies, one in Västerbotten county and one in Skåne and Blekinge counties. The result indicates that the recreational value is much higher than the timber production value in the area on Mösseberg. This result should however be interpreted with caution because the study is based on a very small extent of reports. The survey was targeted at the organizations operating in the recreational area on Mösseberg. Results show that many of the organizations are generally satisfied with the way the management is conducted today. The response rate was relatively low and only 8 of 23 organizations sent back the survey with answers. Suggestions on what could be done better were information signs and restoration of benches along the trails. The thesis did also result in an objective strategy for Falköpings municipality urban forests and a zone classification with special forest management proposals for the area on Mösseberg. An objective strategy with sub‐objectives eases the planning and the chances of achieving the overall goals. The use of zone classification within urban forestry planning is an increasingly used method and has several advantages. Larger areas could be included in a single zone, which is based on user values instead of tree species and growth. This means that management measures will be easier to both plan and execute. The zone classification performed on the area of Mösseberg was developed by local knowledge and new insights gained from the result section in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|Retinal {{detachment}} (RD) and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) {{are serious}} eye diseases {{and lead to}} visual lost and blindness. They are caused by retinal breaks and foramina. The consequence is that the neurosensoric retina detaches from retinal pigment epithelium. Retina-Patchs in form of open-porous foils of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) could be a new possibility for closing the retinal breaks. It is intended that the Retina-Patch will be placed epiretinally at the retinal <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> fixed by proliferation of Müller cells (glial cells) located in the retina in the pores of the Retina-Patch. In this study, it was investigated whether textured silicone (TS) complies with the basic requirements {{to use it for}} the development of the ophthalomologic product Retina-Patch. Textured silicone is manufactured by the company Polytech-Silimed (Dieburg, D) in large-scale amount for the production of silicone-textured mamma implants. Samples of this material were provided by the company for this study. The textured silicone is characterized by non-porous and a porous side. The experimental part of this study worked on the physico-chemical and of TS and the growth of glial cells on this material in vitro. In detail, the micro structure of the surface texture, the hydrophilization of TS through surface modification, and the covalent protein immobilization were investigated. Furthermore, the cell growth behavior of glial cells were analyzed with the model of the cell line U 373 (humane astrocytes). A further focus of this study was the investigation of the influence of anionic functionalization on the cell growth with the cell lines U 373 and L 929 (mice fibroblasts). The surface texture of TS is characterized by a big amount of pores. The pore size varies between 37 and 518 µm. The mean of the pore size is 84 µm. Small pores (60 - 90 µm) are most frequent. The inhomogeneity of the pore size distribution is caused by the manufacturing process. With contact angle measuring, the stability of the hydrophilization of TS through surface modification was proved. Graft co-polymerization with allylamine and functionalization with carboxyl groups are the only modification methods to hydrophilize TS longterm. The long-term stability of the hydrophilization through COOH-functionalization is only maintained under storing in water. Plasma treatment with oxygen plasma and anionic functionalization did not hydrophilize TS. Plasmasterilization with hydrogenperoxide plasma increased the hydrophobicity of TS. The influence of surface modification on the proteinadsorption of TS is proved. On plasma modified TS, a protein amount significantly higher than on unmodified resp. Aminfunctionalized TS is adsorbed. With EDC/NHS method, BSA could be covalently immobilized on TS functionalized with carboxyl groups (18, 1 molecules/ 10 nm²). With cross-linking, a 1, 64 -fold higher protein amount could be immobilized. The density of carboxyl groups was 850 molecules/ 10 nm². The in vitro growth of glial cells (U 373 cells) as model cells for a part of the retinal cell population on textured silicone was influenced by sterilization, pore size, and protein type. Plasmasterilization increased significantly cell density and physiologic activity in contrast to steam sterilization. Furthermore, glial cells grew in larger pores (> 50 µm) with the whole cell body and were physiologically active with these pores. In smaller pores, the glial cells proliferated only with the pseudopodes. In addition, BSA coating increased significantly the physiological activity of U 373 cells in long-term in contrast to collagen I coating. In vitro studies demonstrated the increasing of cell density and cell spreading of U 373 and L 929 cells on PDMS after anionic functionalization. Low degrees of functionalization (25 - 50 %) increased significantly the cell density in contrast to high degrees (100 %). Furthermore, the cell spreading decreased with increasing functionalization degree. The results of this study demonstrate in vitro that textured silicone can be fixed epiretinally by glial cells. This is the fundament {{for the development of the}} ophthalmologic application retina-patch. The digression to the project retina-stimulator demonstrates that the epiretinal fixation of laserperforated silicone foils by tissue ingrowth in the pores of the foils is successfull in vivo on the animal model rabbit. This result has to be verified with textured silicone in future investigation. The use of textured silicone in other applications (e. g. drug delivery system) has to be considered in further development, too...|$|E
