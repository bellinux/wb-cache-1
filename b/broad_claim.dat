50|$|The {{fact that}} an {{invention}} is patentable or even patented {{does not necessarily mean}} that use of the invention would not also infringe another patent. The first patent in a given area might include a <b>broad</b> <b>claim</b> covering a general inventive concept if there is at that point no relevant prior art. Later, a specific implementation of that concept might be patentable if it is not disclosed in the earlier patent (or any intervening prior art), but nevertheless still falls within the scope of the earlier claim (covering the general concept). The later inventor must, therefore, obtain a license from the earlier inventor to be able to exploit their invention. At the same time, the earlier inventor might want to obtain a license from the later inventor, particularly if the later invention represents a significant improvement in the implementation of the original broad concept. In this case, the two enter into a cross license.|$|E

5000|$|A claim {{right is}} a right which entails that another person {{has a duty to}} the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing {{something}} to or for the claim holder, such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a claim to that service or product (another term is thing in action). In logic, this idea can be expressed as: [...] "Person A has a claim that person B do something if and only if B has a duty to A to do that something." [...] Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize <b>broad</b> <b>claim</b> rights to things like [...] "life, liberty, and property"; these rights impose an obligation upon others not to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission.

30|$|The {{basic problem}} may be succinctly stated: The service value of cloud {{computing}} in business-to-business context can and does fail where perceptions are ignored by service managers. Although the movement from published literature has been slow, subsequent empirical research has supported this <b>broad</b> <b>claim</b> [11] {{that there is a}} need to understand and measure service value for business generally. In order to have a well-rounded appreciation of service value for cloud computing business users we have obtained the perspectives of service managers who are responsible for cloud computing services in their organisations. This paper focuses more on the service value perceptions by business users of cloud computing rather than on objective technical measures, for example, 99.999  % assurance levels. Through the contribution of this research, we attempt to provide a richer understanding of the service value perceptions, and thus equipping service managers with a fully-rounded view as they integrate their understanding with technical measures.|$|E

40|$|Although many {{unauthorized}} {{immigrants have}} become politically active in campaigning for immigration reform, {{their ability to}} speak out publicly may depend more on political discretion than on the constitutional protections that citizens normally take for granted.

Second, the Supreme Court has approved broad prohibitions on non-citizens spending money on speech that is related to electoral campaigns. Third, the Court has indicated that the federal government might, in its discretion, act to deport immigrants because of their political activities. The Supreme Court should revisit these questions because current case law is in tension with other principles of free speech law, especially the prohibition on identity-based speech restrictions as articulated in Citizens United v.

As the Court explained, the First Amendment protects the rights of marginalized people to have a voice and does not allow the government to prefer some speakers over others based on their identity...|$|E
