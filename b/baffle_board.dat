50|$|After the {{preceding}} looks {{of the early}} 50's (TV front from 1950 to 51/2; wide panel '52-54), Leo Fender changed the cabinet design again, this time opting for no extra wood {{on the front of}} the amp, except for the narrow top and bottom panels that hold the <b>baffle</b> <b>board</b> to the cabinet.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the project of a {{portable}} music player with an amplifier in the class D. The device is powered up by connected power supply unit, eventually by built-in accumulator. Audio signal is played by bluetooth module, sound card or headphone output. Switching inputs and power supply of the accumulator is managed by a micro-controller. A correction equalizer for sound control is also embedded in the booster. All peripheries are put into a wooden <b>baffle</b> <b>board.</b> The sound is reproduced {{by a pair of}} loudspeakers...|$|E
40|$|Wet or moist {{attrition}} {{treatment of}} cornstalks frees the pith from the cortex fiber. Moist attrition treatment yields {{the most desirable}} cortex fiber for paper making. An upward flow of water agitated with air through the screen cover of a tank frees the cortex of pith and fine fiber. Water flotation allows the fine fiber to settle away from the floating pith. The cost is nominal and the products each have commercial uses. A yield of 70 percent over all is obtained and a 50 to 60 percent yield of pith is obtained;Dry attrition treatment of cornstalks frees the cortex of pith. Separation by air on an inclined <b>baffle</b> <b>board</b> or centrifugal air separation, gives one fraction of pith and fine fiber, and a second fraction of heavy cortex fiber;The power consumption of attrition treatment is greatest on wet stalks, moderate on moist stalks, and low on dry stalks;Quite complicated forms of products from cornstalk fiber, such as window sash and fiber pipe, can be pressed and moulded as one-piece structures. These can be cheaply made and they show exceptional structural strength;Cornstalk pressboard can be made very moisture resistant by solvent sizing. A deflection test dry and after immersion is a good measure of moisture resistance;Measurement of the conductivity of press board during drying in the hydraulic press is a dependable means of determining the time at which the board is dry enough not to explode. Conductivity tests of pressed boards will show defects in press heating. Conductivity tests are suited to research work on pressed fiber;Conductometric titration {{can be applied to}} the analysis of cook liquors. A voltmeter and ammeter are an advantage of the set in conductometric analysis used in this work;Organic material is precipitated from spent alkaline straw cook liquors by nearly any acid or by soluble salts of the Ca Ba Sr group;Spent alkaline cook liquor can be regenerated by precipitating the organic material, causticizing, and fortifying with fresh alkali;Organic matter precipitated in paper by H 2 SO 4 or CaCl 2 slows the pulp and causes shrinkage in the paper. The paper strength is not increased...|$|E
40|$|Nearly {{a century}} ago, the liquid self-balancing device was first {{introduced}} by M. LeBlanc for passive balancing of turbine rotors. Although of common use in many types or rotating machines nowadays, little information {{is available on the}} unbalance response and stability characteristics of this device. Experimental fluid flow visualization evidences that radial and traverse circulatory waves arise due to the interaction of the fluid backward rotation and the <b>baffle</b> <b>boards</b> within the self-balancer annular cavity. The otherwise destabilizing force induced by trapped fluids in hollow rotors, becomes a stabilizing mechanism when the cavity is equipped with adequate <b>baffle</b> <b>boards.</b> Further experiments using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) enable to assess the active fluid mass fraction to be one-third of the total fluid mass. An analytical model is introduced to study the effects of the active fluid mass fraction on a flexible rotor supported by flexible supports excited by bwo different destabilizing mechanisms; rotor internal friction damping and aerodynamic cross-coupling. It is found that the fluid radial and traverse forces contribute to the balancing action and to improve the rotor stability, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of sloshing-dynamics-modulated fluid systems driven by orbital accelerations including gravity gradient and jitter accelerations has been studied. Partly liquid-filled rotating Dewars applicable to a full-scale Gravity Probe-B Spacecraft container {{with and without}} baffle are considered. Results show that a slosh wave excited along the liquid-vapor interface induced by jitter-acceleration-dominated orbital accelerations provides a torsional moment with an up-and-down movement of bubble oscillations in the rotating Dewar. The fluctuations of fluid forces and fluid moment (torque) exerted on the Dewar wall of the container caused by slosh-wave excitation driven by orbital accelerations are also investigated. Since the viscous force across a liquid-solid interface and the surface-tension force across a liquid-vapor or liquid-solid interface can greatly contribute to the damping effect of slosh-wave excitation, a rotating Dewar with a baffle provides more areas of liquid-solid, and liquid-vapor, and solid-vapor interfaces than does a rotating Dewar without a baffle. Results show that the damping effect provided by the baffle reduces the amplitudes of force and moment feedback from the fluids to the container-in particular, the components of fluctuations transverse to {{the direction of the}} <b>baffle</b> <b>boards...</b>|$|R
50|$|The inside {{bottom of}} the box is lined with riffles and usually a carpet (called Miner's Moss) similar to a sluice. On top of the box is a {{classifier}} sieve (usually with half-inch or quarter-inch openings) which screens-out larger pieces of rock and other material, allowing only finer sand and gravel through. Between the sieve and the lower sluice section is a baffle, which acts as another trap for fine gold and also ensures that the aggregate material being processed is evenly distributed before it enters the sluice section. It sits at an angle and points towards the closed back of the box. Traditionally, the baffle consisted of a flexible apron or made of canvas or a similar material, which had a sag of about {{an inch and a}} half in the center, to act as a collection pocket for fine gold. Later rockers (including most modern ones) dispensed with the flexible apron and used a pair of solid wood or metal <b>baffle</b> <b>boards.</b> These are sometimes covered with carpet to trap fine gold. The entire device sits on rockers at a slight gradient, which allows it to be rocked side to side.|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{behavior of}} fluids {{affected by the}} asymmetric gravity gradient acceleration has been investigated. In particular, the effects of surface tension on partially filled rotating fluids applicable to a full-scale Gravity Probe-B Spacecraft dewar tank with and without baffles are studied. Results of slosh wave excitation along the liquid-vapor interface induced by gravity gradient acceleration indicate that the gravity gradient acceleration {{is equivalent to the}} combined effect of a twisting force and a torsional moment acting on the spacecraft. The results are clearly seen from one-up one-down and one-down one-up oscillations in the cross-section profiles of two bubbles in the vertical (r, z) -plane of the rotating dewar, and from the eccentric contour of the bubble rotating around the axis of the dewar in a horizontal (r, theta) -plane. As the viscous force, between liquid and solid interface, greatly contributes to the damping of slosh wave excitation, a rotating dewar with baffles provides more areas of liquid-solid interface than that of a rotating dewar without baffles. Results show that the damping effect provided by the baffles reduces the amplitude of slosh wave excitation and lowers the degree of asymmetry in liquid-vapor distribution. Fluctuations of angular momentum and fluid moment caused by the slosh wave excited by gravity gradient acceleration with and without <b>baffle</b> <b>boards</b> are also investigated. It is also shown that the damping effect provided by the baffles greatly reduces the amplitudes of angular momentum and fluid moment fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|AFTER {{ten years}} of Taft-Hartley, {{it is time to}} look back; but looking back can be a deadly indulgence. If we seek to justify our past, or if we long to return, we can like Lot 2 ̆ 7 s wife be turned to a pillar of salt {{standing}} helpless on the desert. Our backward glance is deadening unless we look through the past to see guidelines for the future. Our appraisal must be more than a judgment of whether the Act has succeeded or failed it must give us wisdom to go forward. It should give us greater insight as to future steps in the development of labor law. The Act has remained substantially unchanged for ten years. This does not prove its validity, but may only demonstrate the obstacles to legislating in the field of labor-management relations. Certain defects in the statute and the need for clarifying or corrective legislation have been painfully obvious. The thicket of words in Section 8 (d) which purports to define the duty to bargain has <b>baffled</b> the <b>Board</b> and the courts for ten years; the latent vacuity of Section 301, which allows suits for breach of contracts, was laid bare by the Supreme Court in the Westinghouse case; the disruptive impact of the closed shop provisions on the building trades has been uniformly recognized; the wishful optimism of the cession clause in Section 10 (a) produced a foreboding fear of a 2 ̆ 2 no-man 2 ̆ 7 s land 2 ̆ 2 between federal and state power, and now the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s barbed wire entanglements have made that fear a reality. In spite of all these patent defects, political pressures have brought no corrective action but only legislative paralysis. In this area the interests are so strong and so deeply held that the gradual evolving of legislation is impossible. We do not move by small steps but rather by sporadic leaps. The last ten years have emphasized the need to legislate with the greatest care and foresight, for even bad provisions may live long...|$|R
