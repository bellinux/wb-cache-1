5|$|Mayflies are {{involved}} in both primary production and bioturbation. A study in laboratory simulated streams revealed that the Centroptilum genus of the mayfly increased the export of periphyton, thus indirectly affecting primary production positively, which is an essential process for ecosystems. The mayfly can also reallocate and alter the nutrient availability in aquatic habitats {{through the process of}} bioturbation. By burrowing in the bottom of lakes and redistributing nutrients, mayflies indirectly regulate phytoplankton and epibenthic primary production. Once burrowing {{to the bottom of the}} lake, mayfly nymphs begin to <b>billow</b> their respiratory gills. This motion creates current that carries food particles through the burrow and allows the nymph to filter feed. Other mayfly nymphs possess elaborate filter feeding mechanisms like that of the genus Isonychia. The nymph have forelegs that contain long bristle-like structures that have two rows of hairs. Interlocking hairs form the filter by which the insect traps food particles. The action of filter feeding has a small impact on water purification but an even larger impact on the convergence of small particulate matter into matter of a more complex form that goes on to benefit consumers later in the food chain.|$|E

Carpentier broke his rear wing after he collided with the turn one tire barrier when he locked his brakes and retired after {{it was discovered that}} his gearbox had sustained damage. Having restarted in seventh place, Andretti moved up into fourth position by lap 54. By the 60th lap, Castroneves had a 4.8 second lead over Fernández, who in turn was 3.5 seconds ahead of Bräck. Andretti was a further three seconds behind the Swedish driver, and was holding a two-second lead over Kanaan. Bräck went off at turn nine to retire with a mechanical issue that drained his car's battery on lap 63. Castroneves made a scheduled pit stop on lap 65, handing the lead to Fernández, and rejoined in tenth place. His car started to <b>billow</b> smoke after leaving turn one two laps later and pulled {{off to the side of}} the track at turn eight to retire. The seventh caution period was on the 68th lap to allow safety officials to remove Castroneves' car from the track. Most of the leaders (including Fernández) made pit stops to ensure they could reach the end of the race. Kanaan gained the lead and relinquished it to Andretti when he made a pit stop; Andretti led the field back up to speed at the lap-72 restart, followed by Tagliani.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{stood for}} 14 years before being {{destroyed by a}} great fire on April 23, 1879. About eleven {{in the morning on}} Wednesday morning, 23 April 1879, smoke and flames could be seen rising from the roof of the Main Building. The causes of the fire were impossible to ascertain. Workmen had been working on repairs on the roof until around 10 o'clock, and the fire might have started due to the dry timber on the roof. The fire was first spotted from the minim's courtyard, and soon word of the event spread {{to the rest of the}} students and faculty. Early attempts at putting out the fire were made, with lines of people passing buckets of waters towards the roof of the building. Water was forced into the great tanks on the roof by steam pressure. Despite these efforts, the fire had spread to the entire roof and quickly consumed the upper floors. The South Bend Fire Department was not able to arrive in time to save the main building, because of the long time needed to round up the volunteer firemen and set up the machines. The supports of the dome burned away and the statue went crashing below in a <b>billow</b> of sparks and flame, and even the most courageous abandoned the hope of saving the building and focused on rescuing whatever valuable effects might be carried out of the burning building. In the zeal to save precious objects students threw many of the valuables from the windows, yet despite the well-intentioned effort, almost all of these were lost in crashing on the ground. This was especially true for many of the most precious books and manuscripts.|$|E

Other turbulent structures [...] related to <b>billows</b> [...] are the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and cat's eye structures that occur in fully developed turbulent shear flows.

Realistic theoretical models have been constructed to study the stability and growth of these perturbations. The extent to which <b>billows</b> and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability have been observed in the atmosphere with the use of radars is outlined.

Koropeckyi writes that Mickiewicz has [...] "informed the foundations of [...] parties and ideologies" [...] in Poland from the 19th century to this day, [...] "down to the rappers in Poland's post-socialist blocks, who can somehow still declare that 'if Mickiewicz was alive today, he'd be a good rapper.'" [...] While Mickiewicz's popularity has endured two centuries in Poland, he is less well known abroad though, particularly in the 19th century, he won substantial international fame among [...] "people that dared resist the brutal might of reactionary empires." ...|$|E

40|$|The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) <b>billows</b> {{which appear}} {{in the process of}} gravity wave (GW) {{propagation}} are simulated directly by using a compressible nonlinear two-dimensional gravity wave model. The differences between our model and others include: the background field has no special initial configuration and there is no initial triggering mechanism needed in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region to excite the KH <b>billows.</b> However, the initial triggering mechanism is performed in the lower atmosphere through GW, which then propagate into the MLT region and form <b>billows.</b> The braid structures and overturning of KH <b>billows,</b> caused by nonlinear interactions between GWs and mean flow, can be resolved precisely by the model. These results support the findings in airglow studies that GWs propagating from below into the MLT region are important sources of KH <b>billows.</b> The onset of small scale waves and the wave energy transfer induce the shallower vertical wave number power spectral densities (PSD). However, most of the slopes are steeper than the expected kz&minus; 3 power law, which indicates that GWs with 10 km vertical wavelength are still a dominant mode. The results also show that the evolution of mean wind vary substantially between the different processes of GWs propagation. Before the KH <b>billows</b> evolve, the mean wind is accelerated greatly by GWs. By contrast, as the KH <b>billows</b> evolve and mix with mean flow, the mean wind and its peak value decrease...|$|R

500|$|Prior {{to being}} {{released}} as a single, [...] "Who Really Cares" [...] received a mixed response by reviewers when commenting on Dream Days at the Hotel Existence. Melbourne based webzine [...] reviewer Andrew Weaver {{comments on the}} song's musical layering, coupling the song with [...] "Wishing on the Same Moon" [...] and comments that the layering in the two songs gives the music [...] "genuine depth of sound and taking the veteran group to new places". CitySearch Sydney also made reference to the likeness to [...] "Wishing on the Same Moon", but notes that what sets the two songs apart is [...] "a serviceable fade-out cacophony of keys and guitar". Music journalist Chris Leonard of UK magazine Rock Louder praises the live performance of the song while Powderfinger performed in Glasgow on 11 December 2007. J. Watson of [...] comments that the song, when performed live at The Sydney Opera House Forecourt for charity on 31 October 2007, was [...] "another highlight of the evening". Fellow reviewer from Fasterlouder, ShahXerxes, comments on the song's [...] "sparse Pink Floyd-esque sound which echoes through [...] "Who Really Cares", as clever a rock ballad as the band have ever written." [...] Andrew Ramadge of Mess + Noise echoed the comments of similarities to Pink Floyd, and also Neil Young, stating [...] "where psych-gospel organ and wailing guitar <b>billow</b> around Fanning’s vocals like a lost track from Dark Side of the Moon". Though most of the critical response has been positive, the song has also received criticism from UK reviewer Matthias Scherer of Noize Makes Enemies. Scherer notes that the song's title [...] "Who Really Cares" [...] {{is a question that}} [...] "should have been asked before recording, not during", though this comment refers both to the song itself, and the whole album of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence.|$|E
