5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as <b>burn-up</b> increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.|$|E
25|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of uranium dioxide is low; it {{is affected by}} porosity and <b>burn-up.</b> The <b>burn-up</b> results in fission products being dissolved in the lattice (such as lanthanides), the precipitation of fission products such as palladium, the formation of fission gas bubbles due to fission products such as xenon and krypton and radiation damage of the lattice. The low {{thermal conductivity}} can lead to overheating of the center part of the pellets during use. The porosity results in a decrease in both the thermal conductivity of the fuel and the swelling which occurs during use.|$|E
25|$|The design also {{requires}} {{the use of}} slightly enriched uranium, enriched by about 1 or 2%. The main reason for this is to increase the <b>burn-up</b> ratio, allowing bundles to remain in the reactor longer, so that only a third as much spent fuel is produced. This also has effects on operational costs and timetables, as the refuelling frequency is reduced. As is the case with earlier CANDU designs, the ACR-1000 also offers online refuelling.|$|E

The fuel generates heat energy while simultaneously suffering neutron bombardments and swelling/rupture due to fission product/gas migration, aggregation and buildup. Ingenious analyses, advances in materials processing, and design and testing have permitted the attainment of significant <b>burn-ups</b> (~ 33 GWd/MT). Problems associated with nuclear proliferation due to national/international political instabilities, dictate the need for new nuclear fuel analyses and designs that would lead to high (~ 65 GWd/MT) and ultra high (~ 100 GWd/MT) <b>burn-ups.</b> While such <b>burn-ups</b> have been achieved in some test fuels, the utilization of new fuels in commercial reactors have been fraught with several unanticipated practical difficulties...|$|R
25|$|Assuming {{complete}} tritium <b>burn-up,</b> {{the reduction}} in the fraction of fusion energy carried by neutrons would be only about 18%, so that the primary advantage of the D-D fuel cycle is that tritium breeding would not be required. Other advantages are independence from scarce lithium resources and a somewhat softer neutron spectrum. The disadvantage of D-D compared to D-T is that the energy confinement time (at a given pressure) must be 30 times longer and the power produced (at a given pressure and volume) would be 68 times less.|$|E

This is considered an important milestone in breeder reactor technology. Using the experience gained from the operation of the FBTR, the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor, a 500 MWe Sodium cooled fast reactor is being built at a cost of INR 5,677 crores (~US$900 million) and is expected to be critical by June 2016.

It behaves like U-235 and its fission releases a similar amount of energy. The higher the <b>burn-up,</b> the more plutonium in the spent fuel, but the lower the fraction of fissile plutonium. Typically about one percent of the used fuel discharged from a reactor is plutonium, and some two thirds of this is fissile (c. 50% Pu-239, 15% Pu-241). Worldwide, some 70 tonnes of plutonium contained in used fuel is removed when refueling reactors each year.|$|E

40|$|The multi‐recycling of {{innovative}} uranium/thorium oxide fuels {{for use in}} the European Pressurized water Reactor (EPR) has been investigated, using the Monte‐Carlo based simulation code MURE (MCNP Utilities for Reactor Evolution), based on MCNP 5. If increasing quantities of 238 U, the fertile isotope in standard UO 2 fuel, are replaced by 232 Th, then a greater yield of new fissile material (233 U) is produced during the cycle than would otherwise be the case. This leads to economies of natural uranium of around 30 % if the uranium in the spent fuel is multi‐recycled.
