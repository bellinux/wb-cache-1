How much he composed in this period is a matter of conjecture; his many duties in the Mantuan court may have limited his opportunities, but several of the madrigals that he published in the fourth and fifth books were written and performed during the 1590s, some figuring prominently in the Artusi controversy.|$|E

The reliability of the dates was questioned in 1990, and a later estimate was set at 13,000 to 10,000 BP. In 1990, Rondeau proposed ages of 14,100 to 11,000 BP based on radiocarbon dating and 7,000 to 14,800 BP based on uranium-thorium dating.|$|E

This is also indicated by the reduced third finger, the lack of a gynglymoid lower articulation of the second metatarsal and the rather small and moderately recurved second toe claw. Balaur had a broad pelvis, a broad foot, a large first toe, and broad lower ends of the metatarsals relative to the articulation surfaces; such a combination can in the remainder of the Theropoda only be found with the herbivorous Therizinosauridae.|$|E

Singapore, Gibson details, is lacking any sense of creativity or authenticity, absent of any indication of its history or underground culture. He finds the government to be pervasive, corporatist and technocratic, and the judicial system rigid and draconian. Singaporeans are characterized as consumerists of insipid taste.

The porch spans the length of the building's front (south) facade, at a height of about 6feet (1.8m). The porch is supported by four wooden pillars, which rest on stone bases. The stairs leading to the front porch are supported by two similar wooden posts, which, like the house, are set into fieldstone bases. The first step on the stairs was originally a limestone block embedded in the ground. The porch roof is supported by six wooden, <b>bracketed</b> pillars. The pillars are simple, with the brackets coming from the boxed capitals. At the rear of the porch wooden pilasters set at each end help to support the roof. Differentiating the home from the traditional French Colonial design is the porch roof, which is separate from the main roof.|$|E

5|$|The Charles Payne House is a -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage {{that has}} a spacious garden founded {{on the site of}} a long-removed house. The house's gable end faces the street with a rear ell and the other ell {{perpendicular}} to the main block on the west side. Centered on the east end of the roof is a cross gable which is visually offset by the dormer on the west. The house has a small gable-roofed vestibule on the east side, aligned underneath the cross-gable. The rear ell has an attached porch that spans its length. A single story bay hexagonal bay window protrudes from the facade. The distinguishing feature of the Payne house is the wood trim exterior, consisting of hood mould on the paired windows on the south, four kinds of bargeboards and <b>bracketed</b> cornices on the rear ell's east side. The interior of the Charles Payne House is not covered in detail by any survey, but has three mantelpieces on the first floor, two displaying Gothic Revival influence in their wooden designs and the third, located in the rear ell, made of grey marble with a round-head opening. Though not mentioned in the nomination, a photo shows one of the wooden mantlepieces filled with brick and rendered unusable at the time. The setting of the house was important to the National Register nomination, which specifically highlighted its shaded garden and fencing. At the time of the nomination, an ornamental round head picket fence surrounded the property and access was through a double-leaf lattice work gate. By 2013, the picket fence and entrance gate had been removed, but the property still retains the street frontage for its garden.|$|E

40|$|Available {{commercial}} ceramic <b>brackets</b> {{are made}} of alumina either monocrystalline or polycrystalline. One major drawback of these <b>brackets</b> is fracture during archwire torsion or tipping. Another drawback is that each type comes in one shade only: transparent or translucent. Objectives: To fabricate orthodontic <b>brackets</b> from different esthetic materials and evaluate their mechanical properties; to introduce extremely low profile miniature zirconia <b>brackets</b> and evaluate their torsional fracture strength; also, to fabricate <b>brackets</b> in shades comparable to natural tooth shades, and compare them to commercial ceramic <b>brackets</b> under different lights. Materials and Methods: CAD/CAM technology was used to mill <b>brackets</b> from: ParadigmTM MZ 100 and LavaTM Ultimate resin composite; Mark II feldspathic porcelain; and In-Ceram® YZ zirconia. The <b>brackets</b> were subjected to two separate tests (torque and tipping). The average moments necessary to fracture the <b>brackets</b> were determined and compared to those of commercial alumina <b>brackets,</b> Mystique® MB and Resolve®. Also, miniature zirconia <b>brackets</b> were fabricated and subjected to torsion till failure. Static fatigue test was performed on standard YZ, MZ 100, and Mystique <b>brackets.</b> <b>Brackets</b> were fabricated using CAD/CAM in shade A 3 materials: MZ 100; Lava Ultimate; and Mark II. Zirconia and alumina <b>brackets</b> were also fabricated and colored.

The shaded <b>brackets</b> were compared to commercial alumina brackets: Inspire ICETM; Radiance PlusTM; Avex® CX; and Mystique® MB. Results: Standard zirconia <b>brackets</b> had the highest torsional and tipping strength among the tested esthetic <b>brackets.</b> Miniature zirconia <b>brackets</b> showed comparable or even statistically significantly higher resistance to archwire torsion than commercial alumina <b>brackets.</b> Standard zirconia <b>brackets</b> showed the highest survival rate of 83 %.
