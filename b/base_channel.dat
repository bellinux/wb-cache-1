Combining BEM <b>based</b> <b>channel</b> estimation with WF, in this article we derive the expression for Wiener filter combined BEM <b>based</b> <b>channel</b> estimation (hereafter called WF-BEM), which explicitly considers the effect of ICI. The simulation results show that WF-BEM is better than WF-LS in time-varying channels, especially in fast time-varying cases.|$|R
30|$|As {{stated in}} Section 1, the channel {{estimation}} accuracy at data symbols {{is determined by}} both the channel estimation accuracy at pilot symbols and {{the accuracy of the}} interpolation method. WF is the best interpolation method at the time dimension to estimate channel at data symbols in terms of minimizing MSE. The optimality of WF is independent of the channel estimation method adopted at pilot symbols. Therefore we can infer that the reason that WF-LS underperforms is because the channel estimation accuracy of LS <b>based</b> <b>channel</b> estimation is worse than that of BEM <b>based</b> <b>channel</b> estimation at pilot symbols in time-varying channels, which have been proved by Figure 5. This is also the main reason for our motivation to combine BEM <b>based</b> <b>channel</b> estimation with WF and derive the expression for WF-BEM <b>based</b> <b>channel</b> estimation to deal with channel estimation in time-varying channels.|$|R

30|$|In this article, we {{have further}} {{analyzed}} WF-LS, including the asymptotical relationship between WF-LS with orders 2 and linear interpolation, the asymptotical relationships among WF-LS with different orders. Considering {{the limitation of}} WF-LS is that LS <b>based</b> <b>channel</b> estimation assumes the channel coefficients within one OFDM symbol period are constants, we propose to combine BEM <b>based</b> <b>channel</b> estimation, which can accurately estimate the time-varying channel coefficients during one OFDM symbol period, with WF {{to deal with the}} challenging problem of channel estimation in OFDM systems operating under various mobile environments, especially in high-speed cases. The expression for WF-BEM <b>based</b> <b>channel</b> estimation has been derived, and under the hypothesis of approximating the ICI term as additive white Gaussian noise, the derived result explicitly considers the effect of ICI. The simulation results showed that the proposed WF-BEM provides a substantial gain, in terms of estimation accuracy in time-varying channels, with respect to WF-LS, especially in fast time-varying channels.|$|R
30|$|Although the {{performance}} of WF-LS can be improved by adopting more pilot symbols provided that the above conditions are satisfied, WF-LS has an intrinsic weakness {{that will lead to}} its decreased performance in high speed mobile environments. As will be seen in Section 5, {{the performance}} of WF-LS is acceptable in slow to moderate mobile environments, but decreases significantly in high speed environments. This degradation of WF-LS is due mainly to the fatal weakness of the underlining assumption of LS <b>based</b> <b>channel</b> estimation that the channel coefficients within one OFDM symbol period are constants. This assumption will generally not hold true in time-varying channels, especially in fast time-varying cases. In light of the above analysis and considering that BEM <b>based</b> <b>channel</b> estimation method [13, 14] can accurately estimate the time-varying channel coefficients of an OFDM symbol, we propose to combine BEM <b>based</b> <b>channel</b> estimation with WF to deal with channel estimation in time-varying channels.|$|R

In this paper we propose a new feedback scheme via a subspace <b>based</b> <b>channel</b> quantization method. The pro-posed scheme adopts the chordal distance as a channel quan-tizer criterion so as to capture channel characteristics repre-sented by subspaces spanned by the channel matrix.

40|$|A WEBRC sender transmits packets on a <b>base</b> <b>channel</b> and on T wave channels. The {{transmission}} {{pattern on}} each wave channel is {{a sequence of}} periodically-spaced waves separated by quiescent periods. In a fluid model, the rate of each wave is predominantly described by an exponential decay {{by a factor of}} P each TSD seconds.

This design is complicated by requirements motivated by keeping receiver MRTT measurements simple. Presented here is the design of the beginnings of the waves and a mechanism to convert fluid-model rates to packet transmission times. The final design has two parameters to trade o# the range of fine-grained rate control against the maximum interpacket spacing in the early portion of the wave.

40|$|Abstract — In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increase}} in the types of devices that access unlicensed parts of the radio spectrum. Deployment of wireless multihop networks that use the same parts of the spectrum thus needs to account for possible external interference. Since cooperation in terms of shared medium access cannot be guaranteed, the only alternative would be to communicate on an alternate frequency. Interference can also be caused by nodes in the same network: upstream and downstream nodes of a flow can interfere with one another, a problem commonly encountered in multihop networks. We propose a medium access control scheme that uses a <b>base</b> <b>channel</b> to dynamically allocate channels on a per hop and burst of traffic basis, and that locally blacklists channels that were known to be of poor quality. An advantage of this scheme would be the statistical sharing of the total available bandwidth across all channels amongst multiple networks and types of devices. This results in bursts of traffic being better accomodated compared with static allocation of channels to each network.
