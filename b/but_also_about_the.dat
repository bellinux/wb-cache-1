Steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, El Salvador and Burundi: [...] "My feeling is that one has to grapple with the abyss if one can."

60|$|Of stone-implements I {{was lucky}} enough to secure thirty-six, and made over four of them to my friend Professor Prestwich.

Nearly all are shaped like the iron axe or adze of Urúa, in Central Africa, a long narrow blade with rounded top and wedge-shaped edge.

The people mount it in two ways, either as an axe in line with, or as an adze at a right angle to, the helve.|$|E
