40|$|During the {{refining}} {{of steel}} by basic processes, {{a multitude of}} mineralogical reactions {{take place in the}} refractories with which the furnace is lined. The reactions are caused by an influx of material from the slag and are a function of the composition of the slag and of the refractory. The flow of material from the slag into the refractory resembles the process of metasomatism encountered in nature. The reactions between slags of different composition and magnesiteand chromite-containing refractories could be studied systematically {{as a result of a}} series of four experiments. During each of the experiments four different refractories were subjected to the influence of a slag having a specific composition for a considerable length of time. The experiments were conducted in a rotating furnace at 1700 ° 0 ~ Mineralogical reactions in the refractories used in these experiments can be divided into two main categories, viz. reactions involving the oxides and reactions involving the silicates. The relevant oxides are periclase, the sesquioxides and spinel. Periclase is found to Mndergo reactions like grain growth, resorption and elongation normal to the hot face of the refractory. These reactions are dependent on the composition of the refractory and of the metasomatised components. Reaction between periclase and sesquioxides yield spinel, provided there is no excess of lime. Exsolution of bodies of spinel from periclase is governed by the crystal-chemistry of both minerals. At elevated temperature, spinel, and more specifically chromite, acts as a source of sesquioxides in general, and of ferric oxide in particular. The stability of chromite depends on the molecular ratio between lime and silica of both the refractory and the slag. This ratio determines the amount of sesquioxides present, but not in spinel or in periclase, i. e. in the matrix of the refractory. The postulation of the reactions involving the silicates is possible because of the tendency of the refractory to reach equilibrium with the composition of the slag. The silicates present in acid slags are not in equilibrium with magnesia in the refractory, and consequent reaction yields the minerals monticellite and merwinite. These minerals are not in equilibrium with the bonding silicates of magnesite refractories which have high molecular lime/silica ratios and also not with the bonding silicates of chromite- containing refractories having ver. y low molecular lime/silica ratios. Reaction between metasomatic and autochthonous silicates result in a new set of silicates. The silicates present in <b>basic</b> <b>slags</b> are in equilibrium with magnesia of the refractories as well as with the bonding silicates of magnesite refractories having high molecular lime/silica ratios. Consequently, no reaction results. Reaction does, however, take place between the silicates supplied by <b>basic</b> <b>slags</b> and the bonding silicates of chromite- containing refractories. Ultrabasic slags react mildly with magnesite and drastically with chrome-magnesite bricks. The reason is that in the former reaction, only monticellite and merwinite are not in equilibrium with the composition of the melt, but these minerals have a relatively high mobility, and migrate de~per into the refractory. In chromite-containing refractories, however, neither of the minerals chromite, monticellite or forsterite are in equilibrium with the composition of the slag. Reaction results in the formation of an association of minerals in the area of contact between the slag and the refractory which differs completely from the original minerals of the refractory. The conclusion arrived at is that chromite has a beneficial influence on refractories used in contact with less <b>basic</b> <b>slags,</b> because of the textural superiority of chromite-containing refractories over magnesite refractories. In contact with <b>basic</b> <b>slags,</b> however, metasomatism leads to the formation of components which have low melting points and low viscosities. During the refining of steel by <b>basic</b> processes, ultrabasic <b>slags</b> are preferred and magnesite refractories having high molecular lime/silica ratios are better suited for use in contact with the liquid slag.

Thus, there is a scenery of two primary sectors of production, although distinct ones, that present interaction potential, for, on one hand, there is disponibility of a product with similar properties to the liming materials and traditional fertilizers and, on the other hand, a production sector that is highly dependent of these products. And the interaction between these two sectors helps in the preservation of the environment, bringing, thus, a certain sustainability in the production systems of the postmodern civilization that will be the challenge of this new century. Considering the current possibility of recycling these industrial residues in agriculture, three important factors have to be taken into account. The first would be the proper use of the abundant, available and promising industrial residue; the second, in a propitious agricultural environment, acid soil and low fertility; and third, in a responsive and important socio-economic culture, the sugar cane, considering its vast cultivated area. In national literature, few works have dealt {{with the use of the}} <b>basic</b> <b>slag</b> and have evaluated the reply of the cultures to its application. Thus, the present work had as its aim to gather information from literature concerning the characterization and production of <b>basic</b> <b>slag</b> in Brazil, as well as the agronomic viability of its use in sugar cane, pointing benefits in the liming of the soil and in the supply of nutrients and silicon...|$|E
40|$|Interfacial {{phenomenon}} {{is critical in}} metal processing and refining. While it {{is known to be}} important, there are little data available for key oxide systems in the literature. In this study, the interfacial tension (σLS) of liquid slag on solid oxides (alumina, spinel, and calcium aluminate), for a range of slags in the CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -(MgO) system at 1773 K (1500 °C), has been evaluated. The results show that <b>basic</b> ladle-type <b>slags</b> exhibit lower σLS with oxide phases examined compared to that of acid tundish-type slags. Also, within the slag types (acid and base), σLS was observed to decrease with increasing slag basicity. A correlation between σLS and slag structure was observed, i. e., σLS was found to decrease linearly with increasing of slag optical basicity (Λ) and decrease logarithmically with decreasing of slag viscosity from acid to base slags. This indicated a higher σLS as the ions in the slag become larger and more complex. Through a work of adhesion (W) analysis, it was shown that <b>basic</b> ladle <b>slags</b> with lower σLS result in a greater W, i. e., form a stronger bond with the solid oxide phases examined. This indicates that all other factors being equal, the efficiency of inclusion removal from steel of inclusions of similar phase to these solid oxides would be greater...|$|R
40|$|The {{solubility}} {{of gold in}} metallurgical slags {{has always}} been assumed to be very low, based on the experimental findings of a single study whose data set was subject to {{a high degree of}} scatter. It has also been generally assumed that gold dissolves into slags as uncharged atoms, apparently without any experimental foundation. In this work, the availability of neutron activation analysis, which has a lower detection limit for gold of only 0 ? 005 ppm, was the impetus for a re-examination of gold solubility in slags. It was found that the solubility of gold in iron silicate slag is about a half of that previously reported, and is the same as that in calcium ferrite slag. In both slags, gold solubility is a function of oxygen partial pressure and gold appears to be present as Au+ ions. The solubility of gold in molten PbO slag was found to be very much higher than in iron silicate and calcium ferrite slags and it is proposed that gold dissolves into such highly <b>basic</b> <b>slags</b> as a gold/oxide anion complex. It was shown that these results are consistent with gold being present in this complex in the + 1 oxidation state, and that each gold ion appears to be associated with two oxide ions from the slag. The practical implications of these findings are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Electro Slag Remelting (ESR) {{is one of}} the {{remelting}} {{processes in}} the field of metal refinery. In this process, the slag plays various roles, such as heat generation, protection of melt, and chemical refining. The main objective of the experiments described in this article was to identify the most appropriate slag composition for the electro slag remelting of the steel in order to achieve the chemical composition compliant with the standard applicable to the given steel, minimum sulphur content, minimum contents of oxide and sulphide inclusions, as well as mechanical properties corresponding to the standard applicable to the steel STN 14 109. Ten electrodes were remelted, whereas the remelting was carried out under 8 slags. The used slags containing 70 % of CaF 2 and 30 % of Al 2 O 3 with different addition of CaO, the slags consisted of the same components as previous slags, whereas the ratio of individual components was 1 : 1 : 1, and with SiO 2 and MgO and slag without Al 2 O 3. With regard to all the above mentioned facts, the slag types which may be regarded as the most appropriate for the STN 14 109 steel remelting are the <b>basic</b> <b>slags</b> containing 70 % of CaF 2 - 30 % of Al 2 O 3 with added 30 and 45 weight % of CaO...|$|R

40|$|Gold {{solubility}} in the CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -MgOsat slag {{system was}} measured at 1773 K (1500 C) under a CO 2 -CO atmosphere {{over a wide}} range of compositions, i. e., 8 to 40 mass pct CaO, 26 to 50 mass pct SiO 2, and 0 to 36 mass pct Al 2 O 3, to determine the dissolution mechanism of gold in the CaO-based metallurgical slags. Gold solubility in the present slag system increased with increasing oxygen partial pressure and increasing activity of CaO. From the thermodynamic analysis, the dissolution mechanism of gold into the (alumino-) silicate melts is proposed as follows according to the activity of basic oxide, which indicates that the predominant species of gold is dependent on slag basicity. AuðsÞ þ 1 4 O 2 ðgÞ þ 1 2 O 2 ¼ AuO ð Þ; ð Þ aBO 0 : 1 The enthalpy change for the dissolution of gold into the CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -MgOsat slag system was measured to be about 80 kJ/mol, indicating that the gold dissolution is exothermic. From the iso-Au solubility contours, the dominant factor affecting the gold dissolution behavior is the (CaO + MgO) /SiO 2 ratio, whereas the influence of Al 2 O 3 was negligible. Consequently, less <b>basic</b> <b>slags</b> and higher processing temperatures, in conjunction with a strongly reducing atmosphere, are recommended to increase gold recovery during pyro-processing of Au-containing e-wastes...|$|R
