5|$|The biblical account {{states that}} Samson was a Nazirite, {{and that he}} was given immense {{strength}} to aid him against his enemies and allow him to perform superhuman feats, including slaying a lion with his <b>bare</b> <b>hands</b> and massacring an entire army of Philistines using only the jawbone of an ass. However, if Samson's long hair was cut, then his Nazirite vow would be violated, and he would lose his strength.|$|E
5|$|The player may {{interact}} with and receive quests from the prison's residents, and earns information, tools and other rewards by completing quests. Violent conflict often occurs between the player, inmates and prison guards. The player attacks with Riddick's <b>bare</b> <b>hands,</b> or with improvised weapons such as shivs and clubs. Combos {{are created by}} stringing together punches. A DNA-scanning security system initially prevents Riddick from using firearms, but a limited arsenal later becomes available.|$|E

5|$|Agent Fox Mulder {{arrives at}} the civic center after {{what looks like a}} massacre; bodies lie on the {{sidewalk}} and in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) explains that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator with his <b>bare</b> <b>hands.</b> His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips.|$|E
5|$|At 4.00 a.m. on 17 September, Hellenic {{components}} of the 1st Division Group raided mount Preslap, a key position housing Bulgarian artillery. The Greeks rapidly descended from Golo Bilo and then began climbing the cliffs of Preslap with their <b>bare</b> <b>hands.</b> The Preslap garrison proceeded to abandon their positions and retreat eastwards. Having lost their artillery cover forces at Zborsko followed their comrades in retreat. The Timok Division conquered Topolets and advanced towards Studena Voda and Preslap while the Morava and Yugoslav Divisions overran Koutskov Kamene. At the same time, the Drina and Danube Divisions seized Gradešnica along with the Poltsista and Besistsa peaks, then halted at Melinitsa.|$|E
5|$|The case baffles Colton, as {{the only}} common {{elements}} in the murders are the lack of entry points and the apparent removal of the victims' livers with <b>bare</b> <b>hands.</b> Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks over the case and notes their similarity to earlier murder sprees that occurred in 1933 and 1963. At the crime scene, Mulder notices an elongated fingerprint on the air vent, which he also finds {{to be similar to}} some documented in the X-Files. He concludes that because five murders occurred during the earlier sprees, the investigators should expect two more.|$|E

40|$|Windsurfers {{currently}} do {{not wear}} neoprene gloves when sailing in cold temperatures, as discomfort rapidly develops in the forearms when doing so. Lack of good protection against low temperatures means the hands get painfully cold and numb, limiting sailing time and pleasure. ElectroMyoGraphy (EMG) measurements were done on four forearm muscles of 10 healthy, experienced male windsurfers performing a windsurfing-like task, to find differences in muscle activation between the <b>bare</b> <b>hand,</b> two glove types, and a newly developed experimental prototype. Significantly less EMG activity {{was associated with}} the prototype condition for three out of four muscles, compared to the <b>bare</b> <b>hand</b> and glove conditions. No significant differences in muscle activation were found between the <b>bare</b> <b>hand</b> and the two glove conditions. Results of a questionnaire revealed that subjects found both glove conditions significantly more tiring than the <b>bare</b> <b>hand</b> and prototype conditions. The EMG measurement results indicate that the experimental prototype allows sailors to transfer forces between arm and boom with less effort than in <b>bare</b> <b>hand</b> or gloved conditions, but a probable cause of the forearm discomfort when wearing gloves was not found.

5|$|The most {{determined}} {{resistance to}} the Diệm regime occurred outside the Diệu Đế Pagoda. As troops attempted to stretch a barbed wire barricade across a bridge leading to the pagoda, the crowd tore it down with their <b>bare</b> <b>hands.</b> The protesters fought the heavily armed military personnel with rocks, sticks and their bare fists, throwing back the tear gas grenades that were fired at them. After a five-hour battle, the military finally won control of the bridge by driving armored cars through the angry crowd at sunrise. The defense of the bridge and Diệu Đế left an estimated 30 dead and 200 wounded.|$|E
5|$|After infiltrating the Garden of Death and {{the castle}} where Blofeld spends his time {{dressed in the}} costume of a Samurai warrior, Bond is {{captured}} and Bunt identifies him as a British secret agent and not a Japanese coal miner. After surviving a near execution, Bond exacts revenge on Blofeld in a duel, Blofeld armed with a sword and Bond with a wooden staff. Bond eventually kills Blofeld by strangling him with his <b>bare</b> <b>hands</b> {{in a fit of}} violent rage, then blows up the castle. Upon escaping, he suffers a head injury, leaving him an amnesiac living as a Japanese fisherman with Kissy, {{while the rest of the}} world believes him dead; his obituary appears in the newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with his <b>bare</b> <b>hands</b> in a second". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.|$|E

Wu Song becomes famous for killing a man-eating tiger with his <b>bare</b> <b>hands</b> and is appointed as a constable in his native Shandong. The county magistrate Sun Guoqin later sends Wu {{on a mission to}} Kaifeng with precious tiger bone balm in order to curry favor with influential personages. During his stay in the capital, he makes the acquaintance of Zhou. Zhou finds Wu to be a man of great strength, but feels that he lacks refinement in his martial technique and, therefore, offers guidance for Wu's training. Unfortunately, these two men only interact for a brief two months before Wu has to return home, never to see Zhou again.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, Harada was {{reassigned to}} the {{aircraft}} carrier Hiyō. In early October of that year, the carrier departed Japan {{to take part in}} the Guadalcanal Campaign. On 17 October, Harada formed part of the escort for a force of torpedo bombers which were attempting to attack targets on Guadalcanal. American Grumman F4F Wildcats attacked this force, and while Harada probably downed a Wildcat, his aircraft was badly damaged. His plane crash-landed near the Japanese base at Rekata Bay on Santa Isabel Island, and Harada had to dig himself out from underneath the wreckage of his plane with his <b>bare</b> <b>hands.</b> Harada was later returned to Japan on board a hospital ship.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{it being}} a simpler project due to the {{original}} art being reusable {{turned out to be}} untrue: because so much time had passed since the original's release, there were multiple parts that had to be reworked, leading to a process similar to creating a whole new game from scratch. All character graphics were redone, special effects were changed, and certain animations were added, such as sleeping animations. Some item placements were changed, the overall difficulty was adjusted, and some characters' battle statistics were altered; one such instance was making Kechi stronger than Oryu, due to it being perceived as illogical that a person with a sword would be weaker than a person fighting with her <b>bare</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his protective equipment, a catcher usually also adopts practices that minimize his risk of injury. For instance, unlike fielders elsewhere on the field, a catcher tries, to the extent possible, to catch the ball with his gloved hand alone. An outfielder may catch a fly ball by covering the ball, once it strikes {{the pocket of his}} glove, with his <b>bare</b> <b>hand</b> in order to secure it. The catcher, however, tries to keep his <b>bare</b> <b>hand,</b> which is highly vulnerable to injury, out of harm's way by presenting the pitcher with a target (the large round glove) while hiding his unprotected throwing hand behind his back. By doing so, the <b>bare</b> <b>hand</b> cannot be struck by a foul tip. Many broken fingers, split fingernails, and grotesque dislocations are avoided by adherence to this simple expedient.|$|R

5|$|In 1875, {{again at}} the {{invitation}} of the Prince of Wales, he joined HMS Serapis, which conducted the Prince on an official tour of India, 1875–76. Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and his drawings were published in the Illustrated London News. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 May 1876. The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at Marlborough House for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant on board HMS Sultan. In addition to acting as the Duke's equerry, Louis continued his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke was rather touchy and Louis's cabin was infested with rats, one of which he caught with his <b>bare</b> <b>hands</b> as it ran across his chest as he lay in bed. The Sultan toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.|$|E
5|$|The imprisoned {{architect}} Daedalus tells Kratos {{to unite}} the Labyrinth. Completing this task, Kratos fights {{his way through the}} aerial puzzle and rescues Pandora, who tells him to break the Chain of Balance so the Labyrinth can be raised, and she can reach her box. Neutralizing the three judges and breaking the chain, Kratos raises the Labyrinth, and Pandora tries to enter the Flame of Olympus. Zeus intervenes and fights Kratos; after a brief battle, Pandora sacrifices herself and quenches the flame, despite Kratos' protests. Finding Pandora's Box empty, Kratos attacks the mocking Zeus. Gaia returns and tries to kill them, but they escape through a gaping wound in her chest where they continue their battle. Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which apparently also kills Zeus. When Kratos recovers the blade and tries to leave, he is attacked by Zeus' spirit and loses all of his weapons in the process. Before Zeus can land a fatal blow, Kratos is saved by Pandora during a journey into his psyche. With help from the spirits of his wife Lysandra and daughter Calliope, Kratos forgives himself for his past sins. After discovering the power of hope, he regains consciousness and beats Zeus to death with his <b>bare</b> <b>hands,</b> thus ending the reign of the Olympian Gods.|$|E
