5|$|Coach Perkins met {{for several}} hours with Oklahoma linebacker Brian Bosworth, who entered a {{supplemental}} draft after <b>being</b> <b>kicked</b> off of the Oklahoma team. Perkins and Bosworth were impressed with each other, but the rights to select were awarded lottery-style, and the first selection went to the Seattle Seahawks. The Seahawks drafted Bosworth despite his having sent them a letter telling them not to bother. He expressed a preference {{to play for the}} Buccaneers. When the Indianapolis Colts failed to sign linebacker Cornelius Bennett, the second player selected in the draft (directly after Testaverde), they attempted to trade him to Tampa Bay. Perkins had previously coached Bennett at Alabama, but the Colts, looking for extra draft picks to trade to the Los Angeles Rams to get running back Eric Dickerson, wanted two draft picks in return for Bennett. Perkins felt that this price was too steep. Perkins also attempted to persuade Bo Jackson, their first-overall pick from the 1986 NFL Draft who had refused to sign with the Buccaneers, to change his mind and join the team.|$|E

Villanova was ranked in the top ten for most of the season thanks to a balanced offense. Hilliard scored 23 points on December 20 in an overtime victory over Syracuse, hitting 9-of-17 shots. He hit two free throws to give the Wildcats the first lead of the game in overtime before <b>being</b> <b>kicked</b> in the face and tested for concussion-like symptoms. Against Creighton on January 25, 2015, he scored 24 points and made 6-of-10 three-pointers in a 71–50 victory at home.

He also hit the game-winning three-pointer with 1.5 seconds to play in the game. Eight of his nine field goals in that game were three-pointers, and his eight rebounds were one short of a career-high. He averaged 18.7 points during a nine-game stretch that included the Butler game.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} season, Parrish, {{who appears to}} have been fired from the FBI, is working a desk job as an analyst at the CIA while living with Shelby and {{continuing}} her relationship with Ryan, who later becomes her fiancé. Flashbacks reveal that she is working undercover for the FBI as a CIA recruit. She is tasked with uncovering a rogue faction of the CIA called the AIC. At The Farm, she is joined with other recruits, including Harry Doyle (Russell Tovey), Dayana Mampasi (Pearl Thusi), Sebastian Chen (David Lim), León Velez (Aarón Díaz), Leigh Davis (Heléne Yorke), and Jeremy Miller (David Call). Ryan later joins the other recruits at the site, much to Alex's surprise. Some time after her recruitment, Alex has a meeting with Matthew Keyes and Miranda Shaw. It is revealed that she was recruited by the CIA as part of a covert mission to establish any potential threats within the agency. Ryan is also recruited by the agency for the same mission. Owen Hall (Blair Underwood) is confirmed to be the primary CIA instructor for the training site at TheFarm. In addition, Lydia Hall (Tracy Ifeachor) is later revealed to be another trainer on-site. Alex and the other recruits undergo a series of training assessments in order to become future case officers. After <b>being</b> <b>kicked</b> out of TheFarm by Lydia, Alex goes back to working as an analyst. In addition, she breaks off her engagement with Ryan some time before the 2018 G-20 hostage crisis in New York.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Rainie {{returns to}} Tanya's house as their mother, Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), is visiting. Rainie {{says she is}} now {{completely}} clean and is staying with Cora because her counsellor wants her to reconnect with her family. When Tanya and Greg Jessop (Stefan Booth) go on their honeymoon, Rainie looks after their house and meets Phil at R. They talk about their past but he tells her {{that he does not}} want to associate with her and leaves. She and Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) then get drunk together and later go to his flat and have sex. Jack rejects Rainie the following morning. Tanya and Greg return and see how much trouble Rainie has caused. She also causes trouble with Shirley so Tanya asks her to leave but Rainie persuades Tanya to let her stay, much to Greg's disappointment. Rainie visits Jack's wife Ronnie Branning (Samantha Womack) to find the knickers she supposedly left behind and taunts Ronnie, asking her to tell Jack to phone her, leading to her <b>being</b> <b>kicked</b> out again. She joins a support group to help her stay off drugs and alcohol which Phil also attends. Rainie struggles and calls her drug dealer but Phil catches Rainie with drugs and takes them from her, destroying them. She gets drunk and goes to Tanya's salon, where Tanya takes her home. Greg throws her out after Tanya lies that Rainie tried to stab her. A few days later, Phil finds Rainie in the pub and Shirley catches them talking and wrongly assumes they are romantically involved but finds out that Phil has been sponsoring Rainie. Shirley almost gives Rainie a job in the café but changes her mind.|$|E

5|$|Qualification for Euro 1988 meant {{winning a}} group {{containing}} Bulgaria, Luxembourg and Scotland. The campaign opened with Belgium at the Heysel Stadium, and though Ireland contained danger man Nico Claesen, {{they had to}} settle for a 2–2 draw after conceding twice from corner-kicks; Frank Stapleton and Liam Brady scored the goals for Ireland. They then dominated Scotland at Lansdowne Road, but failed to find the net and instead drew 0–0. In the return fixture at Hampden Park Mark Lawrenson scored an early goal and another clean sheet won the Irish their first win of qualification. The campaign faltered with a 2–1 loss in Bulgaria, though Charlton was furious with referee Carlos Silva Valente as he felt that both of Lachezar Tanev's goals should not have counted as Nasko Sirakov allegedly pushed Mick McCarthy in the build-up to the first and he felt that Sirakov was outside the penalty box when he was fouled by Kevin Moran – Valente instead gave a penalty. They picked up another point after a 0–0 draw with Belgium in Dublin. Despite not particularly impressing Ireland then picked up six points with two victories over Luxembourg. They ended the campaign with a 2–0 home win over Bulgaria, Paul McGrath and Kevin Moran the scorers, though Liam Brady (an ever-present in qualification) picked up a two match suspension after lashing out late in the game after <b>being</b> <b>kicked</b> by a Bulgarian. Despite the victory the Irish had to rely on a favour from the Scots in order to qualify, who duly obliged with a 1–0 victory in Sofia to keep Bulgaria one point behind Ireland in the table.|$|E
5|$|Staley met guitarist Jerry Cantrell at a {{party in}} Seattle around August 1987. A few months before that, Cantrell had watched a concert of Staley's then-band, Alice N' Chains, in his {{hometown}} at the Tacoma Little Theatre and was impressed by his voice. Cantrell was homeless after <b>being</b> <b>kicked</b> out of his family's house, so Staley invited Cantrell to live with him at the rehearsal studio Music Bank, and the two struggling musicians became roommates. Alice N' Chains soon disbanded, and Staley joined a funk band. Cantrell's band, Diamond Lie, broke up and he wanted to form a new band, so Staley gave him the phone number of Melinda Starr, the girlfriend of drummer Sean Kinney, so that Cantrell could talk to him. Cantrell called the number and set up a meeting with Kinney. Kinney and his girlfriend went to the Music Bank and listened to Cantrell's demos, who mentioned that they needed a bass player to jam with them, and he had someone in mind: Mike Starr, with whom Cantrell had played in a band in Burien called Gypsy Rose. Kinney then mentioned that his girlfriend was actually Mike Starr's sister, and that he had been playing in bands together with Starr since they were kids. Kinney called Starr and a few days later he started jamming with him and Cantrell at the Music Bank, but they didn't have a singer. Staley's funk band also required a guitarist at the time, and Staley asked Cantrell to join as a sideman. Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join his band, because Cantrell, Starr and Kinney wanted Staley to be their lead singer, so they started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint. The last straw for Staley was when they auditioned a male stripper – he decided to join the band after that. Eventually the funk project broke up, and in 1987 Staley joined Cantrell's band on a full-time basis. Two weeks after the band's formation, they were playing a gig at the University of Washington, trying to fill out a 40-minute set with a couple of original material along with Hanoi Rocks and David Bowie covers.|$|E
5|$|TNA held a Four-on-Four Tag Team Elimination X match pitting {{the team}} of Alex Shelley, Christopher Daniels, Roderick Strong, and Samoa Joe against {{the team of}} Austin Aries, Chris Sabin, Matt Bentley, and Sonjay Dutt. Matt Bentley was {{accompanied}} by Traci to the ring. The duration of this bout was 23 minutes and 15 seconds. Daniels took over the leadership role of his team, naming them Team Ministry. In this match, each person from each team had to be eliminated by pinfall or submission until all members of one team were gone. The wrestler(s) that remained won the bout for their team. Strong was the first eliminated after being pinned by Aries following a 450° aerial splash. Aries was eliminated soon-after by Daniels, who pinned him with a roll-up while he was distracted by Joe. The third elimination was Dutt, who submitted to Shelley's signature Border City Stretch submission hold. Not long after, Shelley was pinned by Bentley after <b>being</b> <b>kicked</b> in the face. Joe forced Bentley to submit with his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold, bringing the match down to Daniels and Joe versus Sabin. Daniels won the bout for his team by pinning Sabin after slamming Sabin face-first into the mat with his signature Angel's Wings maneuver. An argument ensued between Daniels and Joe after the contest, with Joe angry in the storyline that Daniels eliminated Sabin {{when he wanted to}} instead. This led to Joe attacking Daniels and bashing him over the head with a steal chair. Joe followed up by slamming Daniels into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and then a second time on a steal chair. This left Daniels bloodied {{in the center of the}} ring with TNA's medical crew tending to his injuries.|$|E

25|$|The ball can {{be kicked}} in any {{direction}} and is used as an attacking option or to gain territory. There are three types of kicks used; the punt, drop kick and place kick. To punt the ball the player must kick the ball before it touches the ground. A drop kick occurs if the ball first bounces on the ground before <b>being</b> <b>kicked.</b> With a place kick the ball must {{be placed on the}} ground (usually on a kicking tee or in sand) before <b>being</b> <b>kicked.</b> Slight variations that commonly occur are taps, when a player kicks the ball a very short distance and regathers it, and toe-throughs, when a player kicks the ball along the ground instead of diving on it or picking it up.|$|E

50|$|The place kick, usually {{associated}} with rugby league, rugby union and gridiron was used in Aussie Rules for many years, particularly for kicking out after a behind had been scored.
