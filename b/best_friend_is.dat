40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that people compare themselves with routine standards—such as their best friend—during self–evaluations (Mussweiler & Rüter, 2003). In these past studies, the <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> <b>was</b> more accessible than a former friend subsequent to self–evaluations. We therefore con-cluded that the <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> <b>was</b> used as a routine standard. However, spreading activation from the self to the more closely associated <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> would provide an alternative explanation. In the present research, we want to rule out this possibility and demonstrate that comparison processes {{are responsible for the}} <b>best</b> <b>friend’s</b> increased accessibility. In Study 1, we con-trasted comparative self–evaluations with absolute ones. In Study 2, partic-ipants engaged either in comparative self–evaluations or in self–descriptions. Afterwards the accessibility (Study 1) or the facilitation of judgments (Study 2) of the <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> <b>was</b> assessed. Both studies support the assumption that the <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> <b>was</b> used as a routine standard during comparative self–evaluations...|$|R
