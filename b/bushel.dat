5|$|In the meantime, {{the only}} other bridge across the Delaware River easily {{accessible}} for vehicular use was the covered bridge in Columbia, New Jersey and Portland, Pennsylvania. Drivers heading along the local roads (later designated as State Highway Route 5), often came to Darlington's Bridge first. The McCrackens collected tolls in large <b>bushel</b> baskets, which were often filled to the brim of quarters and half-dollars. Locals said that the McCrackens were sometimes spotted dropping these coins off the bridge and into the river below, although swimmers {{were never able to}} find anything of value to support the myth. Even though the bridge made a large sum of a money and the tollhouse was often filled with money, the place was never robbed for the money. This was because the McCrackens kept two Airedales in the tollhouse, named Duke and Totsey. They kept the place clear from thieves and to add insult to injury, kept people away from visiting the McCrackens at all. Duke and Totsey often kept people from getting money they may have dropped on the ground for people exiting their cars.|$|E

50|$|One {{report from}} 1851 states that 2,000 tons of hay; 3,500 <b>bushels</b> of wheat; 1,500 <b>bushels</b> of barley; 16,700 <b>bushels</b> of oats, 700 <b>bushels</b> of buckwheat; and 10 <b>bushels</b> of Indian corn were {{produced}} in the area.|$|R
25|$|Oats remove {{substantial}} {{amounts of}} nitrogen from the soil. They also remove phosphorus {{in the form of}} P2O5 at the rate of 0.25 pound per <b>bushel</b> per acre (1 <b>bushel</b> = 38 pounds at 12% moisture). Phosphate is thus applied at a rate of 30 to 40kg/ha, or 30 to 40lb/acre. Oats remove potash (K2O) at a rate of 0.19 pound per <b>bushel</b> per acre, which causes it to use 15–30kg/ha, or 13–27lb/acre. Usually, 50–100kg/ha (45–90lb/ac) of nitrogen in the form of urea or anhydrous ammonia is sufficient, as oats use about one pound per <b>bushel</b> per acre. A sufficient amount of nitrogen is particularly important for plant height and hence, straw quality and yield. When the prior-year crop was a legume, or where ample manure is applied, nitrogen rates can be reduced somewhat.|$|E
25|$|Regional farmers did {{succeed in}} {{bringing}} some crops to maturity, but corn and other grain prices rose dramatically. The price of oats, for example, rose from 12¢ per <b>bushel</b> ($0/m³) in 1815 (equal to $ today) to 92¢ per <b>bushel</b> ($/m³) in 1816 ($ today). Crop failures were aggravated by an inadequate transportation network: with few roads or navigable inland waterways and no railroads, it was expensive to import food.|$|E
25|$|Jersey Shore's {{location}} on the West Branch Susquehanna River, just downstream {{from the mouth of}} Pine Creek made it an ideal location for traders and other businessmen who outfitted the pioneers who settled the western most portions of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley and the Pine Creek valley. Thomas Martin was a farmer who sold his produce to the people of Jersey Shore and to {{the men and women who}} were just passing through. Mr. Martin was noted for his strong beliefs regarding the prices that he set.

If his competitors would sell potatoes for 50 cents a <b>bushel,</b> Martin would not raise his price and if others lowered the price to 25 cents per <b>bushel,</b> he would not lower his price.

Twenty acres were dedicated to pasture, half an acre for gardening/orchard, eight for wheat, two acres for potatoes and around 60 acres for hay. The land also had one house, two barns, three carriages, four carts, six ploughs one reaper, one horse rack and one fanning mill. That year the crop yields consisted of 75 <b>bushels</b> of wheat, 150 <b>bushels</b> of barley, 300 <b>bushels</b> of oats, five <b>bushels</b> of beans, 200 <b>bushels</b> of potatoes, 40 <b>bushels</b> of turnips, 10 <b>bushels</b> of beets, 35 <b>bushels</b> of carrots, six <b>bushels</b> of pears/plums and 80 tons of hay.

In particular, a new standard yard and troy pound were manufactured as the standards for length and weight respectively. A new measure, the imperial gallon, which replaced the many gallons in use, was defined as being the volume of 10pounds of water at 62°F which, after the authorized experiments, was found to be 277.274 cubic inches. The <b>bushel,</b> which like the gallon, had definitions reflecting the various gallons, was defined as 8imperial gallons.|$|E

Agricultural produce was sold by the <b>bushel</b> which was based on yet another gallon – the dry gallon of 268.8 cubic inches.
