5|$|In {{the fifth}} episode, {{president}} Teikun Ō is found dead, and Bansai attempts to rig Miwa's trial in her favor by manipulating Mikagami through {{the kidnapping of}} her adopted son, Shimon Aizawa. Edgeworth prevents this, and investigates the murder, learning that Teikun Ō has been dead for twelve years: the person previously thought to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> was a body double, who had hired Hōinbō to kill the president to take his place, and was helped by Miwa and Bansai {{to cover up the}} crime. Sarushiro is revealed to be Kazami's long lost son; as a child, he was abducted by Hyōdō to prevent Kazami from winning the cooking contest. Hyōdō forced his own son, Naito, to dispose of Sarushiro, hence why Sarushiro had Naito killed. Hōinbō found Sarushiro and brought him to an orphanage; Sarushiro later saw Hōinbō kill Teikun Ō on behalf of the body double, Miwa and Bansai. They betrayed Hōinbō, but Sarushiro helped him escape; he later enacted his revenge on them, manipulating them into killing Naitō and Kagome, and killing the body double. In addition, {{he was the one who}} attacked and framed Kay to ensure that Edgeworth got involved and exposed Bansai. Sarushiro is imprisoned, and Edgeworth regains his position as a prosecutor.|$|E
5|$|Meyer is {{challenged}} {{in the general}} election by Southern Senator Bill O'Brien. The election ends in an Electoral College tie, but with Meyer having won the popular vote. After an ambiguous result in Nevada, the Meyer camp successfully campaigns for a recount. The recount backfires, and O'Brien keeps Nevada as a victory, as well as overtakes the popular vote. Congress must then decide who will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> After the House of Representatives fails to elect the President, Meyer agrees to be Vice President for her running mate Tom James, however the Senate instead elects O'Brien's running mate Laura Montez as Vice President. Due to the tied vote in the House, the office of the President is left vacant, meaning that now as Vice President, Montez immediately ascends to the presidency. As a result, James makes plans to return to the private sector while Meyer, now completely out of office, contemplates her future.|$|E

25|$|Milan Bandić heavily used {{religion}} {{as an issue}} in the campaign, calculating that Josipović's agnosticism would be a turn-off for a largely Catholic country as Croatia. He constantly repeated the only one he fears is God and that he was raised as a true believer and a humble Christian, also making claims that he has the support of the Catholic Church. Josipović largely ignored Bandić's attempts saying he would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of all Croatians no matter their religious beliefs. The incumbent president Stjepan Mesić was elected twice despite his atheism. However, the Bandić campaign used all tactics to force the issue, even distributing fliers in front of churches after the Sunday mass across the country urging believers to choose between the cross and a red star, referencing communism.|$|E
25|$|Montoto {{went on to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of Metropolitano, {{a railway}} consortium.

Montoto's partnership in this and other early ventures with Sergio Tasselli, a leading K-businessman, also raised questions at the time. In 2003, La Nación said that Tasselli, whose businesses, according to the newspaper, are always under “a pall of suspicion,” was “quietly building an economic empire” that was growing “in the shadows,” and that his “associates generally do {{not come from the}} world of business but from the world of politics, such as former Montoneros leader Mario Montoto.” Instead of improving the train service provided by Metropolitano, Montoto reportedly directed Alejandra Rafuls to film train operations and to edit the film {{in such a way as}} to make it look as if customers were themselves responsible for the service problems.|$|E
25|$|The {{most direct}} attack by Bandić on Josipović {{came at the}} very end of the first debate when he accused him of {{damaging}} the city of Zagreb in 1998 by allegedly abusing his position as the head of the oversight board of a savings bank Zlatica to make a series of financial maneuvers that enabled him to collect his deposit of 138,000 Deutsche Marks from the bank Komercijalna banka that had been blocked and later went bankrupt. Bandić cited a court ruling from 2006 that had invalidated those maneuvers. Josipović defended himself saying that was merely a civil case which he was not even a part of and that he did not commit any illegal actions. Josipović also had to defend his damaging quotation that Croatia would be coloured red by the next election, saying that it was only natural for a political party to be ambitious saying he does not consider the remarks to be unfitting repeating once again that, if elected, he would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of all citizens.|$|E
