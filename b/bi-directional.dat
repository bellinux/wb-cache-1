5|$|CSF {{moves in}} a single outward {{direction}} from the ventricles, but multidirectionally in the subarachnoid space. Fluid movement is pulsatile, matching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by the beating of the heart. Some authors dispute this, posing {{that there is no}} unidirectional CSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent <b>bi-directional</b> systolic-diastolic to-and-fro cranio-spinal CSF movements.|$|E
5|$|MF Skarnsund II was {{the same}} size as Ytterøy, had placed for 30 cars and was <b>bi-directional.</b> She cost NOK27 million and was in service from 1987 to 1991, when she was sold to Namsos Trafikkselskap for NOK23 million. The 330tonne vessel was built by Trønderverftet.|$|E
5|$|Aerial robots must be {{unmanned}} and autonomous, {{and must}} compete {{based on their}} ability to sense the semi-structured environment of the competition arena. They may be intelligent or preprogrammed, but they must not be controlled by a remote human operator. Computational power need not be carried on the air vehicle itself. Computers operating from standard commercial power may be set up outside the competition arena boundary and uni- or <b>bi-directional</b> data may be transmitted to/from the vehicles in the arena. Size or weight constraints are normally placed on the aerial robots, which must be equipped with a method of manually activated remote override of the primary propulsion system.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a <b>bi-directional</b> IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2007, the Staten Island Railway used Baltimore & Ohio Railroad style color {{position}} light signals that dated {{back to when}} it was a B line. In 2007, a $72 million project to replace the old signal system was completed. The system was replaced with an FRA-compliant 100Hz, track circuit based, Automatic Train Control (ATC) signal system. As part of the project, forty R44 subway cars and four locomotives were modified with on board cab signaling equipment for ATC <b>bi-directional</b> movement. A new rail control center and back-up control center was constructed as part of this contract.|$|E
5|$|An {{endpoint}} of a pipe is addressable with a tuple (device_address, endpoint_number) as {{specified in}} a TOKEN packet that the host sends when {{it wants to}} start a data transfer session. If {{the direction of the}} data transfer is from the host to the endpoint, an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) having the desired device address and endpoint number is sent by the host. If the direction of the data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A <b>bi-directional</b> endpoint, on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, the ferries were {{equipped}} with televisions. The following year, {{the company had}} a deficit of NOK1.1 million. It transported 195,000 passengers, of which 120,000 took the Vangshylla–Kjerringvik service. Mobile telephones came into use in January 1972. In 1973, the service was reduced {{as a result of}} the oil crisis, which lasted until 1 March 1974. Smoking indoors was banned from 1975, and a new quay was built in Levanger and opened on 1 July 1976. Local disagreement about the location of a new quay on Ytterøy delayed construction, and it did not open until 1981. In 1974, planning for a new ferry on the Ytterøy service started, although the order was not placed until June 1979. The new ferry, Ytterøy, cost NOK10.5 million, had space for 30 cars and was <b>bi-directional.</b> It was put into service in February 1981. Innherredsferja II was kept as a reserve.|$|E

25|$|To {{ease the}} {{construction}} of new tram tracks into Jätkäsaari beginning in 2009, HKL considered using <b>bi-directional</b> trams on the new line. However, HKL decided to build the Jätkäsaari extensions with conventional return loops and to use the existing uni-directional rolling stock. The next time <b>bi-directional</b> rolling stock might be considered is the conversion of the orbital trunk bus line 550 (formerly branded Jokeri) into light rail.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, {{the centre}} {{terminating}} track was {{converted to a}} <b>bi-directional</b> main line with the platform face {{on the eastern side}} fenced off. As part of the 2000s upgrading works, the fencing was switched to the opposite platform.|$|E
25|$|Platforms 7 and 8 are <b>bi-directional</b> 12-car through {{platforms}} generally {{used for}} southbound services to London King's Cross, London Liverpool Street and Stansted Airport.

25|$|Tomasello {{argues that}} this kind of <b>bi-directional</b> {{cognition}} is central to the very possibility of linguistic communication. Drawing on his research with both children and chimpanzees, he reports that human infants, from one year old onwards, begin viewing their own mind as if from the standpoint of others. He describes this as a cognitive revolution. Chimpanzees, as they grow up, never undergo such a revolution. The explanation, according to Tomasello, is that their evolved psychology is adapted to a deeply competitive way of life. Wild-living chimpanzees form despotic social hierarchies, most interactions involving calculations of dominance and submission. An adult chimp will strive to outwit its rivals by guessing at their intentions while blocking them from reciprocating. Since <b>bi-directional</b> intersubjective communication is impossible under such conditions, the cognitive capacities necessary for language don't evolve.|$|E
25|$|Parallel to İstiklal Avenue {{runs the}} wide <b>bi-directional</b> {{boulevard}} named Tarlabaşı Caddesi, which carries {{most of the}} traffic through the area and was constructed in the 1980s. The streets {{on either side of}} this road contain historic buildings and churches. The once cosmopolitan areas surrounding them have deteriorated.|$|E
25|$|During weekday midday {{hours and}} weekday rush {{hours in the}} peak {{direction}} (AM to Flushing; PM to Jamaica), alternate southbound local service terminates at 188th Street and Horace Harding Expressway in Fresh Meadows. During weekday rush hours, <b>bi-directional</b> limited-stop service is operated along the full route between Jamaica and Flushing.|$|E
25|$|It was {{believed}} that one would find a <b>bi-directional</b> relationship between insomnia and pain, but instead {{it was found that}} trouble sleeping was more likely a cause, rather than a consequence, of pain in patients with cancer.

25|$|The complex {{contains}} three four-lane automobile bridges—one northbound, one southbound, and one <b>bi-directional</b> — {{that carry}} Interstate395 (I-395) and U.S. Route1 (US1) traffic. In addition, the complex contains two rail bridges, {{one of which}} carries the Yellow Line of the Washington Metro; the other of which, the only mainline rail crossing of the Potomac River to Virginia, carries a CSX Transportation rail line.|$|E
25|$|The {{line end}} {{clearance}} distance of 28 nm essentially forces pitches {{to be at}} least 56 nm for EUV single exposure <b>bi-directional</b> patterning. 7nm node minimum metal pitch is already at 40 nm or below, while gate pitch can also be below 56 nm, so this is an indication that multiple patterning would be needed even for EUV at 7nm.|$|E
25|$|Each bus is {{equipped}} with an electronic board and speakers that announce the name of shelters in Indonesian.

25|$|In 2005, {{researchers}} at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign created a three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulation of the Chicago River, which suggested that density currents are the cause of an observed <b>bi-directional</b> wintertime flow in the river. At the surface, the river flows east to west, away from Lake Michigan, as expected. But deep below, near the riverbed, water seasonally travels west to east, toward the lake.|$|E
25|$|Between 2009 and 2012, {{recurrent}} {{neural networks}} and deep feedforward neural networks {{developed in the}} Schmidhuber's research group, winning eight international competitions in pattern recognition and machine learning. For example, the <b>bi-directional</b> and multi-dimensional long short-term memory (LSTM) of Graves et al. won three competitions in connected handwriting recognition at the 2009 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), without any prior knowledge about the three languages to be learned.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the bridge}} – or {{by way of}} lifts – is the island platform. Opposite Platform 3 is Platform 4, another through <b>bi-directional</b> platform, with {{sections}} designated as 4a and 4b. There are two east facing bays (Platforms 5 and 6). Platform 7 is an additional through platform, {{the only one with}} third-rail electrification; it is split into 'a' (eastern) and 'b' (western) sections and thus capable of accommodating two trains at once.|$|E
25|$|The {{station has}} seven {{platform}}s. Platform 1 is a bay platform {{located at the}} east end (a second one alongside {{it is no longer}} utilised for passenger traffic but can be used for stock stabling). Platform 2 at the western end is another bay platform. Platform 3 is a through <b>bi-directional</b> platform and is closest to the concourse; it is split into sections 3a and 3b although on occasions a train will use the middle of the platform.|$|E
25|$|Jet, {{being part}} of a {{relational}} database management system (RDBMS), allows the manipulation of relational databases. It offers a single interface that other software can use to access Microsoft databases and provides support for security, referential integrity, transaction processing, indexing, record and page locking, and data replication. In later versions, the engine has been extended to run SQL queries, store character data in Unicode format, create database views and allow <b>bi-directional</b> replication with Microsoft SQL Server.|$|E
25|$|When one {{track of}} a {{double-track}} railway {{is out of}} service for maintenance or a train breaks down, all trains may be concentrated on the one good track. There may be <b>bi-directional</b> signalling and suitable crossovers to enable trains {{to move on to}} the other track expeditiously (see, for example, the article on the Channel Tunnel), or there may be some kind of manual safeworking to control trains on what is now a section of single track. See single-line working.|$|E
25|$|After lengthy consultation, the M23 was {{converted}} to SBS on November 6, 2016, replacing the identical local counterpart bus line. Unlike the former local line, the westbound stop on 5th Avenue and two <b>bi-directional</b> stops on Lexington Avenue {{will not be}} served by this line. The M23 is based out of the Michael J. Quill Bus Depot, as is the M34 and M34A SBS. The M23 is the fifth corridor in Manhattan and the sixth Manhattan bus line to have Select Bus Service.|$|E
25|$|Various {{efforts have}} been made to {{eliminate}} turtles to improve upon the speed of bubble sort. Cocktail sort is a <b>bi-directional</b> bubble sort that goes from beginning to end, and then reverses itself, going end to beginning. It can move turtles fairly well, but it retains O(n2) worst-case complexity. Comb sort compares elements separated by large gaps, and can move turtles extremely quickly before proceeding to smaller and smaller gaps to smooth out the list. Its average speed is comparable to faster algorithms like quicksort.|$|E
25|$|Kosciuszko Bridge (New York City): This {{connects the}} boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens in New York City, {{replacing}} a truss {{bridge of the}} same name which could no longer handle the modern volume of traffic. The first six-lane cable-stayed span (temporarily <b>bi-directional)</b> opened to traffic in April 2017. The old bridge will be demolished in summer 2017, and a second, nearly identical span will be built in its place; when finished, each span will carry traffic in a single direction. Both new bridges include decorative lighting.|$|E
25|$|The new bridge has a <b>bi-directional,</b> tiered toll {{structure}} {{based on}} vehicle class, peak/off peak period, and E-ZPass/Pay-by-Plate payment option (see http://www.snjb.net/traveling-the-snjb/toll-rates) {{and a free}} pedestrian walkway/jogging path, which is open during daylight hours. (Wind restrictions may apply.) Bicyclists may use the shoulder lanes or the walkway for no charge. Plans presented by the developers also indicate the design facilitates an expansion to four lanes, should same be desired at a future date. The new South Norfolk Jordan Bridge was completed and opened on October 17, 2012. The reported cost of construction was $142 million.|$|E
25|$|The {{road surface}} was laid in 1998/1999 and the tunnel opened for traffic on 21 May 1999, roughly 20 {{years after the}} first formal studies had been prepared. The final cost of the whole scheme {{including}} feeder roads and not just the tunnel itself was IR£105 million (approx €133 million). The tunnel has two separate two-lane bores (each lane 3.75 m wide). There is a service walkway about 1 metre across which doubles as an emergency escape. During periods of maintenance, one tube may be closed and the other used for <b>bi-directional</b> traffic.|$|E
25|$|Minehead {{signal box}} was closed on 27 March 1966 {{after which the}} two tracks between there and Dunster were {{operated}} as two <b>bi-directional</b> single lines, one to each platform. Dunster Signal Box was retained to control the level crossing and points there, and ground frames allowed the train crew to change the points at Minehead to allow locomotives to run round {{from one end of}} the train to the other. The original turntable was removed from Minehead in 1967 by which time all trains were operated by diesels.|$|E
25|$|For duplex transmission, i.e. sending and {{receiving}} in both directions, <b>bi-directional</b> relay repeaters were developed {{starting with the}} work of C. F. Varley for telegraphic transmission. Duplex transmission was essential for telephony and the problem was not satisfactorily solved until 1904, when H. E. Shreeve of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company improved existing attempts at constructing a telephone repeater consisting of back-to-back carbon-granule transmitter and electrodynamic receiver pairs. The Shreeve repeater was first tested on a line between Boston and Amesbury, MA, and more refined devices remained in service for some time.|$|E
