5|$|The reader {{progressively}} learns their history. Dobroselova originally {{lived in}} the country, but moved to St. Petersburg (which she hates) when her father lost his job. Her father becomes very violent and her mother severely depressed. Her father dies and they move in with Anna Fyodorovna, a landlady who was previously cruel to them but at least pretends to feel sympathy for their situation. Dobroselova is tutored by a poor student named Pokrovsky, whose drunken father occasionally visits. She eventually {{falls in love with}} Pokrovsky. She struggles to save a measly amount of money to purchase the complete works of Pushkin at the market for his birthday present, then allows his father to give the books to him instead, claiming that just knowing he received the <b>books</b> <b>will</b> be enough for her happiness. Pokrovsky falls ill soon after, and his dying wish is to see the sun and the world outside. Dobroselova obliges by opening the blinds to reveal grey clouds and dirty rain. In response Pokrovsky only shakes his head and then passes away. Dobroselova's mother dies shortly afterwards, and Dobroselova is left in the care of Anna for a time, but the abuse becomes too much and she goes to live with Fedora across the street.|$|E

25|$|Speaking at {{a conference}} {{organised}} by The Library Campaign and Voices for the Library he added: The book {{is second only to}} the wheel as the best piece of technology human beings have ever invented. A book symbolises the whole intellectual history of mankind; it's the greatest weapon ever devised in the war against stupidity. Beware of anyone who tries to make books harder to get at. And that is exactly what these closures are going to do – oh, not intentionally, except in a few cases; very few people are stupid intentionally; but that will be the effect. <b>Books</b> <b>will</b> be harder to get at. Stupidity will gain a little ground.|$|E
25|$|In March 2014, Executive Editor Mark Tavani at Ballantine Bantam Dell bought World Rights to {{a science}} fiction trilogy by Sigler. In the first book, Alive, a young woman awakes trapped in a {{confined}} space with no idea who she is or how she got there. She soon frees other young adults {{in the room and}} together they find that they are surrounded by the horrifying remains of a war long past … and matched against an enemy too horrible to imagine. Further adventures will follow in two more books, Alight and Alone. The <b>books</b> <b>will</b> be published under the Del Rey imprint. On Wednesday, July 15, 2016, it was announced that Alive made #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list in the Young Adult E-Book category.|$|E

25|$|Seals {{are also}} often used on Chinese {{calligraphy}} works and Chinese paintings, usually imprinted in such {{works in the}} order (from top to bottom) of name seal, leisure seal(s), then studio seal. Owners or collectors of paintings or <b>books</b> <b>will</b> often add their own studio seals to pieces they have collected. This practice {{is an act of}} appreciation towards the work. Some artworks have had not only seals but inscriptions of the owner on them; for example, the Qianlong Emperor had as many as 20 different seals for use with inscriptions on paintings he collected. Provided that it is tastefully done (for example, not obscuring the body of the painting, appropriate inscription, fine calligraphy, etc.), this practice does not devalue the painting but could possibly enhance it by giving it further provenance, especially if it is a seal of a famous or celebrated individual who possessed the work at some point.|$|E

500|$|The three <b>books</b> <b>will</b> {{together}} encompass {{what can}} be considered Jordan's final vision of the series. In the foreword, Sanderson states {{that they can be}} thought of as [...] "the three volumes of A Memory of Light or as the final three books of The Wheel of Time. Both are correct." [...] He also comments on the differing writing style, suggesting that it could be compared to different film directors directing the same script. The Gathering Storm consists of a prologue, 50 chapters, and an epilogue.|$|E
500|$|Harry and the Potters {{with its}} strong persona or theme {{is as much}} a {{performance}} art project as it is a rock band. Musically, they sound much like other indie rock music with the exception that the band adheres to a novel conceit: the Harry Potter <b>books</b> <b>will</b> inspire the lyrics. As Joe said in a 2005 interview, [...] "We try to take the themes from the books and amplify them." [...] Their musical sound is described as [...] "simple, catchy rock – think The White Stripes crossed with Raffi – where everyone sings along which is easy because in songs like 'Voldemort Can't Stop the Rock' the title is pretty much the only line." [...] Another reviewer’s ear hears [...] "a touch of the Ramones in their ultra simple lyrics." ...|$|E
500|$|As one {{reviewer}} put it, {{the cats}} {{in the series}} are [...] "true to their feline nature," [...] leading some critics to jokingly comment that the <b>books</b> <b>will</b> [...] "leave readers eyeing Puss a bit nervously" [...] and wondering [...] "what dreams of grandeur may haunt the family cat." [...] However, this realism also means that the series contains a relatively large amount of violence, with one critic stating that it is [...] "not {{for the faint of}} heart." [...] Several critics have compared Warriors to Brian Jacques' Redwall series, though one commented that it was [...] "not as elegantly written." [...] The New York Times called the series a [...] "hit with young readers", specifically because of its [...] "sprawling universe", and the series was able to appear on the New York Times Bestseller List for a total of 117 weeks, as of 24 November 2013.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Fan Fare", Waugh {{forecasts}} {{that his}} future <b>books</b> <b>will</b> be unpopular {{because of their}} religious theme. On publication in 1950, Helena was received indifferently by the public and by critics, who disparaged the awkward mixing of 20th century schoolgirl slang with otherwise reverential prose. Otherwise, Waugh's prediction proved unfounded; all his fiction remained in print and sales stayed healthy. During his successful 1957 lawsuit against the Daily Express, Waugh's counsel produced figures showing total sales to that time of over four million books, two thirds in Britain and the rest in America. Men at Arms, {{the first volume of}} his war trilogy, won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1953; initial critical comment was lukewarm, with Connolly likening Men at Arms to beer rather than champagne. Connolly changed his view later, calling the completed trilogy [...] "the finest novel {{to come out of the}} war". Of Waugh's other major postwar works, the Knox biography was admired within Waugh's close circle but criticised by others in the Church for its depiction of Knox as an unappreciated victim of the Catholic hierarchy. The book did not sell well—"like warm cakes", according to Waugh. Pinfold surprised the critics by its originality. Its plainly autobiographical content, Hastings suggests, gave the public a fixed image of Waugh: [...] "stout, splenetic, red-faced and reactionary, a figure from burlesque complete with cigar, bowler hat and loud checked suit." ...|$|E

A review by Booklist noted the longer length of the book and also praised the mission and new characters introduced in the book.
