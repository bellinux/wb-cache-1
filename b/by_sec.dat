500|$|In 1874, Grant's cabinet {{reached its}} lowest ebb {{in terms of}} public trust and {{qualified}} appointments. [...] After the presidential election of 1872, Grant reappointed all of his cabinet with a single exception. [...] Charges of corruption were rife, particularly from The Nation, a reliable journal that was going after many of Grant's cabinet members. Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell had been elected to the U.S. Senate in the 1872 election and was replaced by Assistant Treasury Secretary William A. Richardson in 1873. Richardson's tenure as Treasury Secretary was very brief, as another scandal erupted. [...] The government had been known to hire private citizens and groups to collect taxes for the Internal Revenue Service. [...] This moiety contract system, although legal, led to abuse in the loosely run Treasury Department under Sec. Richardson. [...] John D. Sanborn was contracted <b>by</b> <b>Sec.</b> Richardson to collect certain taxes and excises that had been illegally withheld from the government; having received an exorbitant moiety of 50% on all tax collections. Treasury officials pressured Internal Revenue agents not to collect delinquent accounts so Sanborn could accumulate more. [...] Although the collections were legal, Sanborn reaped $213,000 in commissions on $420,000 taken in taxes. [...] A House investigation committee in 1874 revealed that Sanborn had split $156,000 of this with unnamed associates as [...] "expenses." [...] Although Richardson and Senator Benjamin Butler were suspected to have taken a share of the profit money, there was no paper trail to prove such transactions, and Sanborn refused to reveal with whom he split the profits. [...] While the House committee was investigating, Grant quietly appointed Richardson to the Court of Claims and replaced him with the avowed reformer Benjamin H. Bristow. On June 22, 1874 President Grant, in an effort of reform, signed a bill into law that abolished the moiety contract system.|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{concerns}} raised by David P. Weber, former SEC Chief Investigator, regarding conduct <b>by</b> <b>SEC</b> Inspector General H. David Kotz, Inspector General David C.

Williams concluded in his 66-page Report that Kotz violated ethics rules by overseeing probes that involved people with whom he had conflicts of interest due to [...] "personal relationships." [...] The report questioned Kotz's work on the Madoff investigation, among others, because Kotz was a [...] "very good friend" [...] with Markopolos. It concluded that while it was unclear when Kotz and Markopolos became friends, it would have violated U.S. ethics rules if their relationship began before or during Kotz's Madoff investigation. [...] The report also found that Kotz himself [...] "appeared to have a conflict of interest" [...] and should not have opened his Standford investigation, because he was friends with a female attorney who represented victims of the fraud.|$|E
