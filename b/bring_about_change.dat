Michael Brown discusses the use of nantag stones among the Aguaruna as being similar to this type of technology.|$|E

Snyder rejects the perspective which portrays nature and humanity in direct opposition to one another. Instead, he chooses to write from multiple viewpoints.

Protesters called for a complete shutdown of Japanese nuclear power plants and demanded a shift in government policy toward alternative sources of energy.

Huckabee also polled higher than Romney among the group who said it was more important to be a social conservative than a fiscal conservative, while Romney led Huckabee 29%-25% among the group who said that being fiscally conservative was most important. In addition, Romney also polled highest in the categories of experience and competence, the ability to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>change,</b> and electability.|$|E
25|$|In this {{interview}} he also expressed {{his belief that}} currently, the global market is the largest force shaping {{the lives of people}} throughout the world. For this reason, he believes that {{the most effective way to}} solve social problems in individual countries is to address them at a global level by changing the policies dictating the global market. He explained that since most people are not given the power to directly change these policies, the most effective way to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>change</b> would be to make a statement to those running the economy by becoming self-sufficient through boycotting corporations, growing one's own vegetables, and making one's own clothes.|$|E

25|$|Toro {{was unable}} to secure a lasting popular support. A group of more radical {{officers}} resented his reluctance to challenge the rosca, and they supported a coup by Colonel Germán Busch Becerra (1937–39) in 1937. A new constitution was promulgated in 1938, stressing {{the primacy of the}} common good over private property and favored government intervention in social and economic relations. It also legalized the Indian communities and included a labor code. In 1939 Busch challenged the interests of the mine owners for the first time by issuing a decree that would prevent the mining companies from removing capital from the country. None of his policies, however, resulted in significant popular and military support, and completely alienated the conservative forces. Frustrated by his inability to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>change,</b> Busch committed suicide in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Rocker became {{convinced}} {{that the source of}} political institutions is an irrational belief in a higher authority, as Bakunin claimed in God and the State. However, Rocker rejected the Russian's rejection of theoretical propaganda and his claim that only revolutions can <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>change.</b> Nevertheless, he was very much attracted by Bakunin's style, marked by pathos, emotion, and enthusiasm, designed to give the reader an impression of the heat of revolutionary moments. Rocker even attempted to emulate this style in his speeches, but was not very convincing. Kropotkin's anarcho-communist writings, on the other hand, were structured logically and contained an elaborate description of the future anarchist society. The work's basic premise, that an individual is entitled to receive the basic means of living from the community independently of his or her personal contributions, impressed Rocker.|$|E

25|$|Activate is {{a network}} of young leaders in South Africa which aims to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>change</b> though {{creative}} solutions to problems in society. Youth from all backgrounds and provinces in the country participate in a two-year programme. In the first year, there are three residential training programmes, working on a particular task. In the second year, participants form action groups on specific tasks, taking their work into the public domain. In one example, an Activator describes how he works in his local community to discourage young people away from joining gangs and engaging in substance abuse. He draws on his own negative experiences with gangs and drugs, having served seven years in jail. On being interviewed, he states: “My vision for South Africa is to see young people standing up and becoming role models... Be yourself, be real and pursue your dreams”.|$|E
25|$|This wave {{started at}} the {{beginning}} of the nineteenth century. It was characterized by the hope that al-Nahda (Arab Renaissance) and enlightenment would allow the region catch up with more developed nations. Although they differed in ideology and worldview, the common theme among the enlightenment intellectuals was their belief in gradual progress without sudden leaps even if it takes decades. They did not support violence or revolution, but preferred peaceful methods such as education and science to <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>change.</b> Most of them saw the Western world as a model to follow and imitate; some even called for full Europeanization. Another shared theme was their attempt to explain the backwardness of the Arab world and the progress of the Western world by one grand cause, each of them claiming to have found this cause. Despite the long time-frame and successive generations of this wave, the author concludes that it failed to achieve its goals.|$|E
