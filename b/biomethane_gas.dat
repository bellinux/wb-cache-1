40|$|AbstractNatural gas {{used for}} power {{generation}} {{will be increasingly}} sourced from more geographically diverse sites, and unconventional sources such as shale and <b>biomethane,</b> as natural <b>gas</b> reserves diminish. A consequential life cycle approach {{was employed to examine}} the implications of an evolving gas supply on the greenhouse gas (GHG) performance of a future United Kingdom (UK) electricity system. Three gas supply mixes were developed based on supply trends, from present day to the year 2050. The contribution of upstream gas emissions - such as extraction, processing/refining, - is not fully reported or covered by UK government legislation. However, upstream gas emissions were seen to be very influential on the future electricity systems analysed; with upstream gas emissions per MJ rising between 2. 7 and 3. 4 times those of the current supply. Increased <b>biomethane</b> in the <b>gas</b> supply led to a substantial reduction in direct fossil emissions, which was found to be critical in offsetting rising upstream emissions. Accordingly, the modelled high shale gas scenario, with the lowest biomethane adoption; resulted in the highest GHG emissions on a life cycle basis. The long-term dynamics of upstream processes are explored in this work to help guide future decarbonisation policies...|$|R

40|$|The Dutch gas {{distribution}} infrastructure faces several {{significant changes in}} the near future. One of the major changes is the production and injection of <b>biomethane</b> into the <b>gas</b> distribution grid. This article introduces a Design Synthesis Tool (DST) that automatically generates biomethane supply chains and {{gas distribution}} grids for user-defined regions with biomaterial availability. The tool enables Distribution System Operators (DSOs) in leaning up their biomethane grid development process by increasing design effectiveness through the assessment of many feasible solutions concurrently and improves efficiency by reducing design times drastically...|$|R
40|$|The use of biowaste as a {{resource}} allows moving closer to EU’s common objectives by {{reducing the amount of}} waste disposed in landfills. Also by using biowaste to produce something (biogas, compost) the reuse of waste materials is increased. If the biowaste is used to produce the biogas then the biogas upgrading to biomethane quality and the distributing the <b>biomethane</b> through natural <b>gas</b> network is an opportunity to efficiently use renewable energy in more populated (urban) areas and increase the energy independence of country. This is a great amount that can be recycled to avoid waste disposal. Unfortunately the organic waste management is not developed in Latvia...|$|R
40|$|Fuels {{based on}} {{renewable}} resources are currently on everyone's lips {{as they are}} not based on and therefore do not deplete fossil resources. There are currently four big research projects about alternative fuels running under the 6 th framework programme of the European Union. The EU promotes the development mostly for environmental reasons, but supply security is also an issue. The project BIOGASMAX deals with the production of biogas in different European cities and regions. Biogas is produced {{from all kinds of}} waste and subsequently upgraded to <b>biomethane</b> (natural <b>gas</b> quality), distributed and eventually used as vehicle fuel. It {{is the responsibility of the}} GaBi group to conduct Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies of the various biomethane provision chains. LCA of the different technologies at sites all over Europe requires an efficient data collection. A detailed evaluation framework was developed in BIOGASMAX, including automatic data upload procedures as well as a tool to provide specific online questionnaires and ad hoc calculation of indicators and charts. From the LCA point of view, challenging methodological questions have to be answered, e. g. the evaluation of the complex and interrelated systems of "waste disposal", "(bio-) fertilizer production" and "fuel production"...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the challenges facing}} the evolving biogas sector and integration into electricity grids fed with increasing amounts of energy generated by intermittent wind and solar sources. Biogas is a readily storable gas {{which can be used}} to generate electricity, when needed, and therefore to make up for periods of time when the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining. Various options for biogas storage are considered, both locally at the site of biogas plants and in centralized locations where bigger and more efficient gas engines can be used for electricity generation. Upgrading to <b>biomethane</b> allows <b>gas</b> storage in the natural gas grid and later use for conversion to electricity. Additional biomethane can also be produced by a range of power-to-gas concepts, which also allow storage. Finally, while biogas plants are normally operated under constant conditions, recent research has shown the anaerobic digestion process may not be adversely affected by substantial changes in operating conditions over a period of a few hours or days, and therefore biogas production could in principle be regulated and used on demand when the electricity grid is needed from the power.

40|$|Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s {{transport}} sector consumes just {{slightly less than}} one third of all energy in Ireland and is heavily dependent on oil imports, especially diesel. The European Union has set targets {{that are to be}} met by 2020, in order to guarantee a sustainable future for Europe and assure security of energy supply. There is an increase of biofuel usage in the {{transport sector}}, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encourage indigenous production of renewable sources. Currently, Ireland has only two licensed suppliers of biodiesel. The Irish government has issued a number of policy support mechanisms, and while that has increased the use of biofuels in Ireland, it has not necessarily aided the domestic suppliers of biofuels. The aim {{of this paper is to}} detail the existing policies and support mechanisms in Ireland and to examine whether it is possible for Ireland to produce biofuels indigenously while meeting the 2020 targets and competing with the alternative conventional imports. Alternatives to the current supply scenario will be considered, including alternatives such as electric vehicles, recovered waste vegetable oils, and grass gasification for <b>biomethane</b> for natural <b>gas</b> vehicles...|$|R
40|$|Steam {{explosion}} pretreatments {{was used}} to improve the anaerobic biodegradability of Miscanthus lutarioriparius (M. lutarioriparius). The pretreatments were carried out under five different conditions: L 1 (0. 5 MPa 153 °C 5 min), L 2 (1. 0 MPa 180 °C 5 min), L 3 (1. 5 MPa 198 °C 3 min), L 4 (1. 5 MPa 198 °C 5 min) and L 5 (1. 5 MPa 198 °C 10 min). The biochemical methane potential (BMP) of raw M. lutarioriparius sample was 181. 7 ± 10. 7 mLCH 4 /gVS. After applying the steam explosion pretreatments under the five aforementioned levels, the BMP value of pretreated samples increased by 5. 9 %, 19. 9 %, 51. 3 %, 49. 7 % and 49. 8 % respectively. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) of raw and pretreated M. lutarioriparius, revealed {{the disintegration of the}} biomass structure. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images revealed the apparent disruption of the recalcitrant structure of the M. lutarioriparius. The structural changes in M. lutarioriparius observed via FTIR and SEM after steam explosion therefore led to the improvement in <b>biomethane</b> potential and <b>gas</b> production rate. BMP results indicate that M. lutarioriparius could be effectively converted to bioenergy in forms of biogas after steam explosion pretreatment...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} ways to use biogas from {{anaerobic}} digestion, in addition to the traditional use in cogeneration and trigeneration plants, there is also the possibility to purify biogas by using an up-grading plant and to inject <b>biomethane</b> in the <b>gas</b> network SNAM.

The results of this analysis enable to make a choice not only technologically developed but also economically and environmentally sustainable; it strictly binds to a plant fed by renewable energy sources as the anaerobic digestion is...|$|R
40|$|In the {{changing}} Dutch energy market, the ageing gas distribution grid needs investments. There is, however, a large uncertainty regarding certain aspects {{that affect the}} future role of this gas distribution grid, such as the eventual share of <b>biomethane</b> in the <b>gas</b> mix, whether power-to-gas will take-off and the expected lifetime of the grid. Hence, it is currently unclear what investments {{need to be made}} for the gas distribution infrastructure in order to cope with future changes. To find out how the future may unfold for the Dutch gas distribution infrastructure in 2050, four scenarios have been developed. Two key forces – a key force is a factor that has a large impact on the gas distribution grid but great uncertainty exists regarding its outcome – were chosen, namely “perceived energy resource scarcity” and “willingness and ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions”. Each scenario sketches the future Dutch gas infrastructure by defining, among others, the extent to which biomass will be used to produce biomethane, whether fossil fuel is allowed to be burned locally, and what types of gas will flow through the gas grid. With these scenarios at our disposal, in the next research step, we will establish the impact of the scenarios on the gas distribution grid – i. e. what the layout will be and the corresponding costs – and the accompanying biomethane infrastructure. For this, 3 typical locations were chosen: a rural region, an urban region, and an intermediate region. Through a multi-objective optimization – with maximizing net present value, maximizing biomethane production, and maximizing CO 2 emission reduction as objectives – the possible layout of the gas distribution grid and the biomethane infrastructure will be determined for each region. The study’s aim is to find similarities in investments among the different layouts, to come to robust investments for the gas distribution infrastructure...|$|R
