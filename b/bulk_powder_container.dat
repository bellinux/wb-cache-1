40|$|The {{ensemble}} averaged spin dephasing rate of localized {{electrons in}} the organic molecule tris(8 -hydroxyquinoline aluminum) or Alq 3 {{has been found}} to be significantly larger in <b>bulk</b> <b>powder</b> than in single- or few-molecule clusters confined within 1 – 2 nm sized nanocavities [B. Kanchibotla et al., Phys. Rev. B 78, 193306 (2008) ]. To understand this observation, we have compared the midinfrared absorption spectra of <b>bulk</b> <b>powder</b> and single- or few-molecule clusters. It appears that molecules have additional vibrational modes in <b>bulk</b> <b>powder</b> possibly due to multimerization. Their coupling with spin may be responsible for the increased spin dephasing rate in <b>bulk</b> <b>powder...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} in situ generated fine excipient particles on the fluidization and aerosolization properties of dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulations. Materials and Methods. Carrier based DPI formulations were prepared under low and high shear blending. Powder rheometery was utilized to measure <b>bulk</b> <b>powder</b> properties in a consolidated and aerated state. Powder fluidization and aerosolization characteristics were related to <b>bulk</b> <b>powder</b> properties using high speed imaging and inertial impaction measurements. Results. High shear blending of formulations resulted in the in situ generation of excipient fines, which corresponded {{to an increase in}} aerosolization efficiency. The generation of fines were shown to increase the tensile strength and free volume of the carrier, which resulted in a characteristic change in the fluidization properties, as observed by high speed imaging. The increase in minimum fluidization velocity and aerodynamic drag forces required to aerate the powder may provide the source of energy for the increase in fine particle re-suspension. Conclusions. The in situ generation of excipient fines affect <b>bulk</b> <b>powder</b> properties of DPI formulations, which directly affects fluidization and aerosolization behaviour of DPI formulations.

40|$|The {{handling}} and storage of <b>bulk</b> <b>powders</b> {{is common in}} many industries such as detergent, pharmaceutical, bulk chemical and food. A lot of materials are susceptible to changes with time {{that may lead to}} <b>bulk</b> <b>powder</b> caking, resulting in an unmanageable powder and process downtime, which impacts upon profitability. In this review {{the current state of the}} art related to powder caking is explored. The relevant interparticle interactions are discussed with respect to elastic and plastic deformations and the development of liquid and solid bridges due to capillary condensation, sintering and solvent evaporation. The environmental, i. e. temperature and humidity, and the mechanical conditions can heavily influence the transformation of a <b>bulk</b> <b>powder</b> and a number of studies are available that attempt to relate these conditions to caking. A significant amount of work related to the caking behaviour of amorphous powders is available in the literature. Amorphous materials are susceptible to caking due to environmental conditions influencing the glass transition temperature. Once the temperature of amorphous powders exceeds the glass transition, viscous flow occurs and cake strength increases. Crystalline solids may undergo transformations leading to caking. It can take a considerable time and cyclic environmental conditions for caking to occur. However, little research focuses on cyclic conditions and there is limited predictive capability. Finally the options available for attempting to reduce caking propensity are briefly covered and a section that discusses the available caking test methods is given...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} a novel method of extracting relevant information from undispersed <b>bulk</b> <b>powder</b> surfaces to be used in particle size analysis. A new surface imaging approach for undispersed powders combined with multivariate modeling was used. Digital surface images of various granule batches were captured using an inventive optical setup in controlled illumination conditions. A descriptor, the gray scale difference matrix (GSDM), which describes the particle size of granular material was generated and extracted from the powder surface image information. Partial least squares (PLS) modeling was used to create a model between the GSDM and the particle size distribution of granules measured with sieving. The use of lateral illumination and the combining of information from 2 surface images strengthened the shading effects on the powder surfaces. The shading effects exposed the topography or the visual texture of the powder surfaces. This textural information was efficiently extracted using the GSDM descriptor. The goodness-of-fit (R 2) for the created PLS model was 0. 91 and the predicted variation (Q 2) was 0. 87, indicating a good model. The model covered granule sizes in the size range of approximately 20 to 2500 μm. The extracted descriptor was effectively used in particle size measurement. This study confirms that digital images taken from undispersed <b>bulk</b> <b>powder</b> surfaces contain substantial information needed for particle size distribution analysis. The use of the GSDM enabled the utilization of <b>bulk</b> <b>powder</b> surface information and provided a fast method for particle size measurement...|$|R
