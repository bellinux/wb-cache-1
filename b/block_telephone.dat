50|$|Ipsos MORI's {{research}} is conducted via {{a wide range}} of methodologies, especially computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), as well as face-to-face and internet surveys. Telephone surveys use a method called random digit dialing (Ipsos MORI being exempt from the Telephone Preference Service as it only <b>blocks</b> <b>telephone</b> calls that involve selling). This system basically uses randomly generated, but area-specific, telephone numbers. This is the preferred method for telephone samples as ex-directory households are included thus not biasing the sample in any way. Ipsos MORI are able to lawfully use this technology as they use it for research purposes as opposed to sales and advertising.|$|R

After dialing their local Internet service provider, the user could [...] "call out" [...] at high speed to services around the world, so the need for long-distance data calls was generally eliminated. As a result of this shift, there was no real need to limit the user to the speed of the long-distance lines, giving the Bell companies flexibility in terms of what to install at the user's site. Their attention turned to Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), which ran over the existing wiring and did not <b>block</b> a <b>telephone</b> connection in the process.

5000|$|Caller ID {{provides}} some protection against unwanted calls, but {{can still be}} {{turned off by the}} calling party.

It also included employing paid moderators; out of 100 staff employed in the company in May 2007, Merrifield estimated that approximately 70 staff were dedicated to policing the game.

50|$|Similarly, some {{countries}} offer anonymous caller rejection, which rejects all calls when the subscriber's name, number (or both) is <b>blocked.</b> Some <b>telephone</b> companies protect their clients from receiving blocked information by routing anonymous calls to a service (such as AT&T Privacy Manager), where {{the caller is}} required to announce himself or herself. The service then asks the called party {{if they want to}} accept or reject the call. Other telephone companies play a recording to the caller advising them of the called party's rejection configuration, and often offer advice (such as prefixing their dialing with *82) on how to get their call to the intended called party. Blocking the number is referred to as calling line identification restriction (CLIR). Emergency services will most likely be able to show the restricted number using a service called calling line identification restriction override (CLIRO), or by using general ANI services.|$|R

50|$|GETS is {{necessary}} because reliance on telecommunications {{has been accompanied}} by an increased vulnerability to network congestion and system failures. Although backup systems are in place, disruptions in service can still occur. Natural disasters, power outages, fiber cable cuts, and software problems can cripple the telephone services of entire regions. Additionally, congestion in the public switched telephone network, such as the well-documented “Mother’s Day phenomenon”, in which Mother’s Day generally has the highest <b>blocking</b> of long-distance <b>telephone</b> calls of any single day of the year, can prevent access to circuits. However, during times of emergency, crisis, or war, government personnel and emergency workers need to know that their calls will go through.|$|R
30|$|Finally, Table 1 in the Appendix {{mentions}} {{some other}} registers and sampling methods {{that have been}} or {{could be used in}} the six countries to sample immigrants. Electoral, foreigner, or telephone registers exist, but are not accessible for scientific research (e.g., the foreigner register in Germany); have severe coverage problems (telephone registers in all countries), or are not a viable alternative because they are based on the population registers (electoral registers). Screening the whole population for immigrants by area-based sampling methods or random dialing of telephone numbers is feasible in principle, but in practice is connected with excessive search costs because immigrants are still a minority. Costs can be reduced in area-based sampling methods {{due to the fact that}} immigrants tend to concentrate in particular geographical units. However, using the geographically clustered nature of the target population increases the risk of overlooking immigrants outside the clusters and decreases the efficiency of estimates based on these samples. However, this cost-reducing method cannot be applied to samples based on other than geographical units, such as <b>blocks</b> of <b>telephone</b> numbers, and even more importantly, due to prepaid and foreign mobile phones, the total population of telephone numbers is often unknown. If all these registers and sampling methods fail, respondent-driven or centre-based sampling techniques are the only practical alternatives.|$|R

The system reviews outgoing calls by a telemarketer, compares it to the general do-not-call lists and the specific customer company do-not-call list and override permitted call list to make a determination if the call should be completed. This integration is due to the incorporation of a general purpose computer in a central location that is connected to all the major telephone carriers switch cluster locations and operated by a service provider. The [...] "do-not-call" [...] database of originating/destination pairs, as well as the logic for <b>blocking</b> or permitting <b>telephone</b> calls, is stored in this computer.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{learning}} experiences of {{students on a}} four-week block on mathematics as part of The Open University’s Foundation Degree for primary teaching assistants. The key research questions seek to identify the outcomes and processes of the teaching assistants’ study {{in relation to their}} work ‘supporting’ children’s mathematical learning, and their wider experience as teaching assistants. The study adopts an interpretivist, constructivist approach based on an illuminative evaluation framework (Parlett & Hamilton, 1972). A questionnaire gathered data from 67 students to provide a broad picture of their experience during the <b>block.</b> Progressively focused <b>telephone</b> interviews were carried out with nine students using their written assignments, online forum posts and questionnaire responses as prompts to discussion. From the literature review I identified two potentially relevant areas of theory, in particular, Harland & Kinder’s (1997) ordering of INSET outcomes, and Lave & Wenger’s (1991) theory of ‘legitimate peripheral participation’. All nine teaching assistants identified positive outcomes from their study relating to their practice, in particular their increased confidence in mathematics as a subject, and ability to work with children in a fine-grained way to the extent that many aspects of their practice might be more accurately characterised as teaching rather than ‘supporting’ learning. A key finding concerned {{the ways in which the}} teaching assistants’ study enabled them to develop agency as practitioners, and strengthened their participation in the professional life of their school. The study brought out how issues surrounding the learning of mathematics sometimes heightened the extent to which this occurred. Harland & Kinder’s hierarchy of INSET outcomes and the notion of legitimate peripheral participation were found to be helpful concepts for understanding the outcomes of the block of study on the work of teaching assistants, but were both identified as insufficiently nuanced to adequately characterise the diversity and complexity of their varied roles and individual career trajectories...|$|R
