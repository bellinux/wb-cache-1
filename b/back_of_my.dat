5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head.|$|E
25|$|Although {{generally}} {{associated with}} the West Coast with individuals and groups such as Blue Scholars and Native Guns, Filipino American hip hop is increasingly represented by emcees in other regions, from East Coast performers such as Q-York hailing from Queens, New York, (currently residing in the Philippines) to Midwestern groups such as Chicago's The Pacifics. Maryland's Gagong Rapper crew gained fame in the early 2000s by flooding the internet with their home-recordings and heading the underground sub-label Sandamukal Records. L.A.'s Grupo ni Berdugo and Sunog Baga, under F.O.B Entertainment, has recently been making names for themselves, the latter being signed by Andrew E's Dongalo Wreckordz and opening up for Gloc-9's L.A. show. Hailing from San Jose, California, Yung Rizzo of Fly High Records, {{is one of the}} hottest up and coming rappers from his region. Currently he is working on projects that include singles featuring mainstream artists The Jacka from Mob Figaz and Mistah F.A.B., as well as his first studio album, <b>Back</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Mind which is planned for release in 2014.|$|E

[...] He stated in 2009: [...] "I think {{the majority of my}} musical influences were set in stone when I was five or six years old." [...] Lytle's vocals have drawn comparisons with Neil Young.|$|E

Still, it's very hard because I made the play. It's always in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind." [...] But Masterton's family held no {{animosity}} towards the players involved or the game. [...] Carol referred to the incident as a fluke, saying that it could have happened to anyone.|$|E
500|$|He also {{introduced}} him to Johan Rothman, the state doctor of Småland and a teacher at Katedralskolan (a gymnasium) in Växjö. Also a botanist, Rothman broadened Linnaeus' interest in botany and helped him develop an interest in medicine. By the age of 17, Linnaeus had become well acquainted with the existing botanical literature. He remarks in his journal that he [...] "read day and night, knowing like the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hand, Arvidh Månsson's Rydaholm Book of Herbs, Tillandz's Flora Åboensis, Palmberg's Serta Florea Suecana, [...] Bromelii Chloros Gothica and Rudbeckii Hortus Upsaliensis...." ...|$|E

About her performance, {{director}} Ron Howard said, [...] "She not only was beautiful and seductive but gave some difficult psychological moments in the film a lot of depth and complexity. She had an extraordinary combination of talent and beauty, and I guess I stored that information in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> brain".|$|E

[...] Townshend agreed, saying that by 1975 Butler had [...] "no influence over him whatsoever." [...] Although he was a loyal companion to Moon, the lifestyle eventually became too much for him; he phoned Curbishley, saying that they needed to move back to England or one of them might die. Butler quit in 1978, and later wrote of his experiences in a book entitled Full Moon: The Amazing Rock and Roll Life of Keith Moon.|$|E

500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, and I kind of built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. When I saw the photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover. At that point I only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind that if I ever made enough songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped push me to develop the songs." ...|$|E

500|$|Kelly {{has also}} {{provided}} songs {{for many other}} artists, tailoring them to their particular vocal range. Women at the Well (2002) had 14 female artists record his songs in tribute. According to Kelly, he adapted his song [...] "Foggy Highway" [...] for Renée Geyer because [...] "I admired her deep soul singing, ferocious and vulnerable ... When I heard the finished version ... the hairs rose up on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> neck." [...] Kelly and The Stormwater Boys recorded it in a bluegrass style as the title track for the 2005 album Foggy Highway. Divinyls' lead singer Christina Amphlett recorded [...] "Before Too Long"—she was attracted by the lyrics—she interpreted the song's narrator as being a stalker, and provided a female perspective in a darkly menacing manner à-la Fatal Attraction.|$|E
500|$|On March 29, 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt {{went to the}} Little White House at Warm Springs, Georgia, to rest {{before his}} {{anticipated}} appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations. On the afternoon of April 12, Roosevelt said, [...] "I have a terrific pain in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head." [...] He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious, and was carried into his bedroom. The president's attending cardiologist, Dr. Howard Bruenn, diagnosed a massive cerebral hemorrhage (stroke). At 3:35pm that day, Roosevelt died without regaining consciousness. As Allen Drury later said, “so ended an era, and so began another.” After Roosevelt's death, an editorial by The New York Times declared, [...] "Men will thank God on their knees a {{hundred years from now}} that Franklin D. Roosevelt was in the White House".|$|E
500|$|On July 1, 1951, Feller {{recorded}} his third career no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers. [...] "I was depending on my slider and I didn't {{begin to think}} of a no-hitter until about the seventh inning. I tried to keep it in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind, bearing down and concentrating on one hitter at a time", Feller said. Feller was the third pitcher, after Larry Corcoran and Cy Young, to record three career no-hitters. He became the first pitcher of the 1951 season to reach 20 wins after he pitched a shutout against the Washington Senators on August 21. Along with Early Wynn and Mike Garcia, Feller reached the 20-win mark during the season; they were the first trio of pitchers on the same staff to earn 20 wins since 1931. Feller was named the Sporting News Pitcher of the Year.|$|E

500|$|Eve Myles {{previously}} {{appeared in}} the 2005 Doctor Who episode [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] as Gwyneth, a 19th-century clairvoyant. Gwyneth had {{a connection to the}} Cardiff Rift, which later became a central plot device in Torchwood. In response to questions about the similarity of the characters' names, Russell T Davies denied they were connected, stating they are [...] "just two names beginning with [...] "G"." [...] Subsequently however, Davies' 2008 Doctor Who episode [...] "Journey's End" [...] alluded to a familial relationship between the characters (with the Doctor specifically asking if Gwen was a family name and Gwen replying that it was), explaining their physical resemblance as the result of [...] "spatial genetic multiplicity". Eve Myles said of the two characters, [...] "it was never on the cards as such, but something in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head always said {{that they were going to}} be connected somehow." [...] Davies explained that the relationship between the characters is not literal, stating that [...] "It's not familial as we understand it" [...] instead characterising spatial genetic multiplicity as [...] "an echo and repetition of physical traits across a Time Rift." ...|$|E
500|$|Mercer soon married wealthy socialite Winthrop Rutherfurd (1862–1944), {{a widower}} then in his fifties, but despite her {{marriage}} and Franklin's promise, the two remained in surreptitious, albeit infrequent contact {{in the three}} decades that followed. Especially during the War years, Franklin's daughter Anna Roosevelt Halsted arranged for her father to meet with his former mistress, more frequently after Rutherfurd's death in 1944. [...] Mercer was in Warm Springs, Georgia, at the [...] "Little White House" [...] the President's long-time cottage and retreat, {{at the time of}} Roosevelt's death in April 1945. He was having his portrait painted, at Mercer's request, by the artist Elizabeth Shoumatoff in the living room – with Mercer and two female cousins attending. While sitting at a card table by the fireplace, reading an upcoming speech, Roosevelt said, [...] "I have a terrific pain in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head." [...] He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious. [...] Madame Shoumatoff, who maintained close friendships with both Roosevelt and Mercer, rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity. [...] Mercer's presence in the house was not mentioned in the immediate press reports nor in any of the early published biographies.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{returned}} to the NBA {{as coach of the}} Lakers {{near the end of the}} 1993–94 NBA season, replacing Randy Pfund, and Bill Bertka, who served as an interim coach for two games. Johnson, who took the job at the urging of owner Jerry Buss, admitted [...] "I've always had the desire (to coach) in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind." [...] He insisted that his health was not an issue, while downplaying questions about returning as a player, saying, [...] "I'm retired. Let's leave it at that." [...] Amid speculation from general manager Jerry West that he may only coach until the end of the season, Johnson took over a team that had a 28–38 record, and won his first game as head coach, a 110–101 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. He was coaching a team that had five of his former teammates on the roster: Vlade Divac, Elden Campbell, Tony Smith, Kurt Rambis, James Worthy, who would retire after the season, and Michael Cooper, who was brought in as an assistant. Johnson, who still had a guaranteed player contract that would pay him $14.6 million during the 1994–95 NBA season, signed a separate contract to coach the team that had no compensation. The Lakers played well initially, winning five of their first six games under Johnson, but after losing the next five games, Johnson announced that he was resigning as coach after the season. The Lakers finished the season on a ten-game losing streak, and Johnson's final record as a head coach was 5–11. Stating that it was never his dream to coach, he chose instead to purchase a 5% share of the team in June 1994.|$|E
