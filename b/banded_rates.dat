40|$|The {{trade-off}} between {{interest rate}} variability and {{the width of}} an exchange rate target zone is examined, using the regulated Brownian motion model of target zones. It is shown that for narrow exchange <b>rate</b> <b>bands,</b> and for reasonable parameter values, the interest rate differential's asymptotic variability is increasing in {{the width of the}} exchange rate band; whereas for wide exchange <b>rate</b> <b>bands</b> it is slowly decreasing in the exchange <b>rate</b> <b>band.</b> The interest <b>rate</b> differential's instantaneous variability is decreasing in the width of the exchange <b>rate</b> <b>band.</b> A narrow target zone differs from a completely fixed exchange rate regime in that the interest rate differential's instantaneous stadard deviation is high and even increases when the zone narrows. The model is extended to include a realignment/devaluation risk, as well as an endogenous exchange rate risk premium. The risk premium is small for reasonable parameter values and does not matter much...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{framework}} for the analysis of policy-makers' choices regarding unilateral exchange <b>rate</b> <b>bands.</b> Exchange <b>rate</b> <b>bands</b> are viewed as the outcome of an optimization problem by a policy-maker whose objective function weighs the level of the real exchange rate against the level and variability of the real exchange rate. The analysis endogenizes policy decisions about realignments and about the width of the band. Conditions are developed for the case in which optimal band width widens in response to a decrease in policy-makers' commitment reputation, an increase in the cost of reneging on the existing band, and an increase in the variance of fundamental shocks.

To that end, we apply a sequential procedure that considers both {{the dynamics of}} exchange rates and central bank interventions to data covering the period from 1971 to 2003. Our results suggest that implicit bands existed in two subperiods: April-December 1980 and March-October 1987, the latter coinciding with the Louvre Accord. Furthermore, {{the study of the}} credibility of such implicit bands indicates the high degree of confidence attributed by economic agents to the evolution of the Yen/Dollar exchange rate within the detected implicit <b>band</b> <b>rate,</b> thus lending further support to the relevance of such implicit bands...|$|R

The data link layer standard is responsible for fully specifying how messages are assembled ready for transmission by the physical layer, error handling, message-filtering and bus arbitration and how these standards are to be implemented in hardware. The application layer standard, in general defines how the data communication layers are interfaced to the application that wishes to communicate. It describes message specifications, network management implementations and response to the request from the application of services. Layers three to six are not described in fieldbus standards.|$|R

40|$|Interest rates play a {{significant}} role of intermediation between savers and potential borrowers. High deposit rates acts as incentives to attract savings while high lending rates discourage credit demand from potential borrowers. The margin between deposit rate and lending rate at a given time period forms an interest <b>rate</b> <b>band</b> which has implications on borrowing and deposit mobilization in the economy. In Kenya, the interest <b>rate</b> <b>band</b> has persistently remained wide despite the efforts to narrow it down. Several factors have been established that influence this wide interest <b>rate</b> <b>band.</b> However, this was before the financial reform period when commercial banks dominated the financial sector.
