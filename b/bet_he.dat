500|$|Politicians {{from both}} parties opined on the propriety of the Fund and on what Nixon should do, most in accord with their {{political}} affiliation.

500|$|Pausch {{was then}} {{introduced}} by Steve Sea-bolt, {{who was the}} Vice President of Worldwide Publishing and Marketing at Electronic Arts, {{in addition to being}} Pausch's close friend and former co-worker.

[...] Seabolt began the next part of the introduction by talking about Pausch's academic achievements and previous career with the University of Virginia and Electronic Arts.

500|$|Sam then meets Rebecca Howe, {{who is the}} {{new manager}} of Cheers and almost {{immediately}} turned off by him based on the rumors of Sam's [...] "sexual prowess". Rebecca uses Sam's former office as her own and, {{although it has been}} completely renovated, Sam is able to use Carla's tricks to overhear Rebecca talking to her boss Evan Drake, on whom she has a crush. Evan knows Sam as a baseball player and wants to hire him to be a bartender. Sam is then hired, but one of the two current bartenders must be sacked to make room for him. The bar regulars want Wayne to go, but Rebecca wants to fire Woody. A competition then ensues to see if Wayne actually knows how to make every drink known. If Wayne loses the <b>bet,</b> <b>he</b> agrees to leave, but if he wins the bet, then he gets Sam's now-damaged sailboat. The gang plays a prank to cause Wayne to lose over the then-fictional cocktail [...] "Screaming Viking" [...] and he walks out, though Rebecca is wise to their game, gives Sam his severance check and tells Sam to leave. Sam then promises nothing of the sort will occur again and is provisionally re-hired on the understanding that this is his last chance as Rebecca uses a seductive baseball metaphor-pun about having two outs, two strikes and [...] "no balls".|$|E

2500|$|Agan {{described}} Colten's {{approach to}} the office as [...] "more businesslike" [...] than had been the part-time manner of the Norman administration. Colten courted Democrats and once rode a [...] "Democrat" [...] donkey in a parade after losing a <b>bet.</b> <b>He</b> maintained good relations with U.S. Representative Joe Waggonner of Louisiana's 4th congressional district and Governor Edwin Edwards, all of which helped to alleviate the impact that Minden faced with curbacks at the largest nearby employer, the Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant.|$|E
2500|$|In 1941 George Hopkins parachuted onto Devils Tower, without permission, as a {{publicity}} stunt resulting from a <b>bet.</b> <b>He</b> had intended to descend by a rope dropped with him, but Hopkins deemed it unusable after it became knotted and frozen due to the rain and wind.

2500|$|Messier was {{featured}} in a Lay's chips campaign that aired in Canada in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

[...] Messier loses the bet, and ends up playing in a local [...] "beer league" [...] hockey game (for a team called [...] "The Pylons"), which he easily dominates. Later variations would have Messier himself making the same <b>bet.</b> <b>He</b> was also featured in Lay's ads in the U.S. where he asked neighbors to borrow ice, sugar or a hairdryer (playing on his bald head) to get chips.|$|E

Erdős won the bet, but complained that during his abstinence, mathematics had been set back by a month: [...] "Before, when I looked at a piece of blank paper my mind was filled with ideas. Now all I see is a blank piece of paper." [...] After he won the <b>bet,</b> <b>he</b> promptly resumed his amphetamine use.|$|E

When she learns that the feared Akito is the [...] "god" [...] of the zodiac and of the <b>bet</b> <b>he</b> made with Kyo, which {{could result in the}} cat being confined for life, she resolves to break the curse. Tohru asks for help from Kazuma, Rin, and Kureno. Despite setbacks and being warned off by Rin—who also seeks to break the curse, in order to free Hatsuharu—Tohru refuses to give up her goal. She eventually receives encouragement and hints from Shigure, who is using Tohru to weaken the curse for his own reasons.|$|E
