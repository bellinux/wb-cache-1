5|$|The Schiehallion {{experiment}} was an 18th-century experiment {{to determine the}} mean density of the Earth. Funded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>from</b> the Royal Society, it was conducted {{in the summer of}} 1774 around the Scottish mountain of Schiehallion, Perthshire. The experiment involved measuring the tiny deflection of a pendulum due to the gravitational attraction of a nearby mountain. Schiehallion was considered the ideal location after a search for candidate mountains, thanks to its isolation and almost symmetrical shape. One of the triggers for the experiment were anomalies noted during the survey of the Mason–Dixon Line.|$|E

5|$|Between 1935 and 1937, Kenyatta was {{employed}} as a linguistic informant for the Phonetics Department at University College London (UCL); his voice recordings of the Kikuyu language assisted Lilias Armstrong in her production of The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu. The book was posthumously published under Armstrong's name, although Kenyatta claimed {{that he should have}} been recognised as co-author. He enrolled at UCL as a student, studying an English course between January and July 1935 and then a course in phonetics from October 1935 to June 1936. Enabled <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>from</b> the International African Institute, he also took a social anthropology course under Bronisław Malinowski at the London School of Economics (LSE). Kenyatta lacked the qualifications normally required to join the course, but Malinowski was keen to support the participation of indigenous peoples in anthropological research. For Kenyatta, acquiring an advanced degree would bolster his status among Kenyans and display his intellectual equality with white Europeans.|$|E
5|$|The Society has {{a variety}} of {{functions}} and activities. It supports modern science by disbursing nearly £42million to fund approximately 600 research fellowships for both early and late career scientists, along with innovation, mobility and research capacity grants. Its Awards, prize lectures and medals all come with prize money intended to finance research, and it provides subsidised communications and media skills courses for research scientists. Much of this activity is supported <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>from</b> the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, most of which is channelled to the University Research Fellowships (URF). In 2008, the Society opened the Royal Society Enterprise Fund, intended to invest in new scientific companies and be self-sustaining, funded (after an initial set of donations on the 350th anniversary of the Society) by the returns from its investments.|$|E
5|$|The house {{remained}} in the Portman family until 1944 when it was accepted in lieu of death duties by the Crown Estate, however Mrs Portman remained at the house until her death in 1951. It was leased to the fire service in 1953. A visitor centre opened in the Victorian stables in 2005. Most {{of the cost of}} the conversion was funded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>from</b> the Heritage Lottery Fund. The house was used as the Emergency Call Centre for the Somerset Area of Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service with a running cost in 2011 of £675,000 per year. The fire service moved out in 2012 and restoration work was then undertaken.|$|E

5|$|Arrington and {{his assistants}} were {{supported}} {{by a team of}} editors, administrative assistants, research historians, oral history experts, and student interns. It was common for many individuals to work on a project; generally the principle author was listed in the article's byline, but sometimes Arrington's name was used to lend a publication authority. As a supervisor, Arrington was not a skillful bureaucrat, and junior staffers complained about their exclusion from decision-making and a lack of communication, which Arrington tried to ameliorate. Richard Bushman, a prominent Mormon historian, suggested that Arrington commission a multivolume history of the church, written mostly by scholars outside the history division staff. William Hartley, Gordon Irving, and Gary Shumway began an oral history program, funded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>from</b> the descendants of James Moyle, a Utah politician. A summer research fellowship offered $1000 for outside scholars to use the LDS Church Archives for projects on Mormon history. Eugene England Sr. also donated money to support projects that Arrington deemed especially important. Additionally, a special Mormon History Trust Fund was formed from individual donations, including royalties donated by staff members.|$|E
