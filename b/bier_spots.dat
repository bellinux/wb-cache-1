50|$|Marshall-White {{syndrome}} is a skin condition {{that consists of}} <b>Bier</b> <b>spots</b> associated with insomnia and tachycardia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bier</b> <b>spots</b> are small, light macules {{usually found}} on the arms and legs of young adults, in which the {{intervening}} skin may seem erthematous but blanches with pressure so that these light macules disappear. This is a benign physiologic vascular anomaly of no significance clinically.|$|E
40|$|Also {{called as}} {{physiologic}} anemic macules, <b>Bier</b> <b>spots</b> are small, hypopigmented irregularly shaped macules {{against a background}} of diffuse erythema, which creates an appearance of speckled vascular mottling of the skin. <b>Bier</b> <b>spots</b> most commonly appear on distal portions of the limbs though there are case reports describing diffuse involvement, which also affect trunk and mucous membranes of the patient. Although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying <b>Bier</b> <b>spots</b> still need to be elucidated, <b>Bier</b> <b>spots</b> have been suggested to be a vascular anomaly caused by vasoconstriction of small vessels. In addition, several diseases have been proposed to be associated with <b>Bier</b> <b>spots,</b> including scleroderma renal crisis, cryoglobulinemia, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, alopecia areata and hypoplasia of the aorta, although it has not been shown whether these associations are casual or coincidental. The clinical presentation of <b>Bier</b> <b>spots</b> is quite typical. These tiny whitish macules easily become prominent when the affected limb is placed in a dependent position and fade away when the limb is raised. Here we report a case of <b>Bier</b> <b>spots</b> in a 32 -year-old male patient with characteristical clinical manifestations...|$|E
40|$|Experiment {{shows that}} the {{vascular}} contraction responsible for <b>Bier's</b> <b>spotting</b> prevails over the local vasodilatation due to mechanical injury of the skin, and causes the local reddening to blanch. It is without effect, however, upon the local vasodilatation caused by histamine pricked into the skin. The results raise doubts concerning {{the validity of the}} hypothesis referring all local vasodilatations to the action of a single chemical substance or set of substances ("H substance"), liberated within the tissues...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the blanchings (<b>Bier's</b> <b>spots)</b> which develop in human skin {{deprived}} of circulation has proved them referable to the same general causes that lead to ischemic patching of the skin of animals, {{and that they are}} conditioned by the same factors. Both are expressions of a secondary contraction of vessels that have become hyperirritable owing to an inadequate circulation. The contraction is favored by emptying the vessels, but it occurs pronouncedly even when there is a trickle through them of arterial blood. In the case of man the contractile impulse is sometimes so great as to overcome the maximum pressure that the vessels will support. The significance of the observations is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Vital dyes {{injected}} intradermally enter lymphatic capillaries directly, rendering them visible, {{and appear}} {{later in the}} draining lymphatic trunks as colored streamers. The method enables one to perceive {{the state of the}} lymphatic channels and the rate of lymph flow within them. It yields consistent results when tested under physiological conditions known to increase or decrease lymph flow. In the horizontally placed normal limb at rest there is slight lymph flow. In a normal leg or arm hanging downward lymph flow ceases although fluid in the limb increases. When a previously dependent arm is raised above the head, or when the foot of a seated subject is propped on a table, lymph flow in the raised limb becomes active. It ceases in the skin of an arm subjected to partial obstruction of the veins by pressure from without, but very active lymph flow appears during the reactive hyperemia which follows upon the release of venous obstruction. It is still greater following release of total circulatory obstruction, and seems to be the same whether or not the limb has previously been engorged with blood. In the ischemic patches which appear in the skin of a limb during total circulatory obstruction (<b>Bier's</b> <b>spots)</b> the lymphatic capillaries are definitely and considerably constricted, whereas they are slightly dilated in the purple, congested regions of the skin round about. On release of obstruction there occurs a strikingly rapid, equal lymphatic drainage from both regions. The significance of all the findings is discussed. When dye is injected intradermally and the skin sucked, much of the foreign material is driven into the lymphatics draining the injected area...|$|R
