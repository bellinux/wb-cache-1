5|$|Gallaher and {{his team}} faced them {{three days after the}} Yorkshire match. The All <b>Blacks</b> <b>had</b> thus far played 27 matches on tour, scoring 801 points while conceding only 22, and all in only 88 days. They were {{struggling}} to field fifteen fit players; a number of their best players, including Stead, were unavailable due to injury.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{several days}} sight seeing around Paris, the All Blacks returned to London. Instead {{of returning to}} New Zealand directly, they discovered that New Zealand Prime Minister Richard Seddon had organised for the team to travel home via the United States. Although the team wanted to return home immediately, Seddon insisted. The All <b>Blacks</b> <b>had</b> two weeks before they departed. Many of them stayed with friends of relatives, while Stead and Gallaher wrote The Complete Rugby Footballer. The team reassembled on 19 January and were farewelled by a dinner with the London New Zealand Society before departing Southampton on the SS New York the next day.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days later}} New Zealand faced Cornwall at Recreation Ground in Camborne. Although {{the score was}} only 12–0 at half time, the New Zealanders ended up with 11 tries, and a 41–0 victory. The team then {{travelled}} to play Bristol, who they played on 23 September. The game was played in front of 6,500 spectators, with the same result as the Cornwall match, a 41–0 victory for New Zealand. They then travelled to Northampton, after stopping in London. The game resulted in another victory, this time 31–0, to the All Blacks. By now, the All <b>Blacks</b> <b>had</b> scored 169 points in their four games, with only four against.|$|E

5|$|In 1911 {{the city}} adopted a {{commission}} form of government, which had three members elected by at-large voting. Considered to be progressive, {{as it would}} reduce the power of ward bosses, this change resulted in the elite white majority strengthening its power, as only the majority could gain election of at-large candidates. In addition, poor whites and <b>blacks</b> <b>had</b> already been disenfranchised. Mobile {{was one of the}} last cities to retain this form of government, which prevented smaller groups from electing candidates of their choice. But Alabama's white yeomanry had historically favored single-member districts in order to elect candidates of their choice.|$|E
5|$|In March 1864, Dixon {{accompanied}} Kentucky Governor Thomas E. Bramlette and John Marshall Harlan, the state's attorney general, to {{an audience}} with President Lincoln to protest the recruitment of blacks {{into the ranks of}} the Union Army. The governor eventually agreed to allow the practice, but only when whites failed to meet their draft quotas. Since recruitment of <b>blacks</b> <b>had</b> been taking place in the Commonwealth for more than two months already, the concession {{was little more than a}} face-saving gesture by Bramlette. Following the end of the Civil War, Dixon retired from public life. He died in Henderson on April 23, 1876, and is buried in Fernwood Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Lancaster was {{considered}} a success in his first campaign as England coach - during the 2012 Six Nations Championship, defending Champions England finished in second place after losing 19–12 to Wales at Twickenham Stadium, but successfully defended the Calcutta Cup beating Scotland 13–6 at Murrayfield. England finished the year on a high, after outplaying World Cup holders New Zealand in November, in which England dominated to win 38–21.

Free <b>blacks</b> <b>had</b> earlier had formerly had suffrage in the state. The voters approved the new Constitution of 1851 by a large majority.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks played Glamorgan in Swansea on 21 December. The All <b>Blacks</b> <b>had</b> the {{advantage}} of the wind in the first 30 minutes. Late in the first half Roberts worked a move from a scrum to pass to Smith, who passed to Harold Abbott. Abbott then passed back to Smith who scored in the corner. In the second half Glamorgan attacked but could not score, and late in the game the All Blacks scored tries to McDonald and Wallace to win 9–0.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} played on 18 November on an icy pitch (straw had not been spread over the pitch the night before), which nearly caused the game to be cancelled. The All Blacks kicked off, and had {{the best of the}} first ten minutes. Scotland {{eventually}} got a scrum near the All Blacks goal-line, and after winning the scrum, passed to Ernest Simson, who dropped a goal to put Scotland ahead 4–0. It {{was the first time the}} All <b>Blacks</b> <b>had</b> been behind on tour. The All Blacks replied with a try under the posts, which was unconverted. A second try was then scored, by Smith; again it went unconverted. Scotland then scored an unconverted try, to lead at half time 7–6. With less than ten minutes to go the score remained 7–6 and it looked like the All Blacks might lose their first match on tour. However, with four minutes to go the All <b>Blacks</b> <b>had</b> a scrum on halfway; the resulting movement finished with George Smith crossing for a try. Bill Cunningham then scored a try with seconds remaining, and the All Blacks were victorious 12–7.|$|E

5|$|France {{achieved}} {{only their}} second Test {{victory over the}} All Blacks in 1973 at Parc des Princes, Paris. The All <b>Blacks</b> <b>had</b> defeated England, Scotland and Wales, and drawn with Ireland on their 1973 tour and France was their last Test. France won 136, and scored two tries to nil, with two penalties the only points from the All Blacks. In 1977 the All Blacks made their first-ever full tour of France. France won the first Test in Toulouse and the All Blacks the second in Paris. France then reciprocated and toured New Zealand in 1979. This time, neutral referees were appointed for the first time. The All Blacks won the first Test 239 at Lancaster Park. However, in the second Test, France upset the All Blacks by winning 2419 on Bastille Day at Eden Park. The victory was France's first win in New Zealand over the All Blacks.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Watts {{settled in}} Durham, N.C. with his wife, Constance Merrick Watts, {{a native of}} the town. He opened a private clinic in general surgery for poor people and African Americans, as <b>blacks</b> <b>had</b> very limited access to medical services. In 1965, he was the chief of surgery at the Lincoln Hospital, {{which was one of the}} city's few {{hospitals}} to serve blacks. The hospital consisted of 150 beds. The hospital was also one of the few hospitals in America at that time which allow African American doctors to perform surgery. While working as chief of surgery Watts also served as a trainer for the hospital's interns. In the 1970s he played a major role in establishing the Lincoln Community Health Center.|$|E

5|$|Mississippi was {{the poorest}} {{state in the}} U.S. in the 1950s, and the Delta {{counties}} {{were some of the}} poorest in Mississippi. Mamie Carthan was born in Tallahatchie County, where the average income per white household in 1949 was $690 ($ in 2013 dollars). For black families, the figure was $462 ($ in 2013 dollars). In the rural areas, economic opportunities for blacks were almost nonexistent. They were mostly sharecroppers who lived on land owned by whites. <b>Blacks</b> <b>had</b> essentially been disenfranchised and excluded from voting and the political system since 1890, when the white-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration. Whites had also passed ordinances establishing racial segregation and Jim Crow laws.|$|E
5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the <b>blacks</b> <b>had</b> to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E
5|$|The All <b>Blacks</b> <b>had</b> {{three more}} games before their Wales Test Their first was again Cheltenham on 6 December at Cheltenham.

The All Blacks scored 10 tries and {{recorded}} their biggest win in nearly a month. The final score witnessed by the 8,000 strong crowd at Birkenhead Park was 34–0. The All Blacks' last match before facing Wales was against Yorkshire in Leeds. The game was played in Northern Union territory, {{and there were many}} league scouts trying to recruit All Black squad members to the rival code. 24,000 spectators watched as the All Blacks won 40–0, which included 10 tries.|$|E
