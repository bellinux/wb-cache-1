40|$|AIM: To {{estimate}} the cost-benefit of endoscopic screening strategies of esophageal cancer (EC) in high-risk areas of China. METHODS: Markov model-based {{analyses were conducted}} to compare the net present values (NPVs) and the <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios</b> (<b>BCRs)</b> of 12 EC endoscopic screening strategies. Strategies varied according to the targeted screening age, screening frequencies, and follow-up intervals. Model parameters were collected from population-based studies in China, published literatures, and surveillance data. RESULTS: Compared with non-screening outcomes, all strategies with hypothetical 100 &#x 2005; 000 subjects saved life years. Among five dominant strategies determined by the incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, screening once at age 50 years incurred the lowest NPV (international dollar-I$ 55 million) and BCR (2. 52). Screening six times between 40 - 70 years at a 5 -year interval [i. e., six times(40) f-strategy] yielded the highest NPV (I$ 99 million) and BCR (3. 06). Compared with six times(40) f-strategy, screening thrice between 40 - 70 years at a 10 -year interval resulted in relatively lower NPV, but the same BCR.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} of applying feasibility risk assessment within transport project infrastructure appraisal. The procedure is based upon quantitative risk analysis and Monte Carlo simulation in combination with conventional cost-benefit analysis converting deterministic <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios</b> (<b>BCRs)</b> into stochastic interval results. Recent research has proven that particularly input based impacts such as construction cost and demand forecasts (travel time savings) often are respectively underestimated and overestimated creating so-called Optimism Bias. Decision-makers and stakeholders are, hereby, often basing their decisions on wrongful material. The presented approach to transport infrastructure appraisal is to include uncertainties and risks in the evaluation. Correspondingly, the handling of uncertainties and risk within transport project assessment are often made up by sensitivity tests producing deterministically based output values. Research has proven that traditional sensitivity analysis seldomnly captures the total variability especially as concerns the costs and demands estimated in the pre-stage of the evaluation. Therefore, this paper {{introduces a}}n approach to decision support based upon so-called reference class forecasting using historical information from similar past projects. The scheme is made evident through a brand new database sample (UPD: the UNITE Project Database) which contains almost 200 specific European transport infrastructure projects.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to estimate the direct losses due to Neospora caninum in Swiss dairy cattle and to assess {{the costs and benefits of}} different potential control strategies. A Monte Carlo simulation spreadsheet module was developed to estimate the direct costs caused by N. caninum, with and without control strategies, and to estimate the costs of these control strategies in a financial analysis. The control strategies considered were "testing and culling of seropositive female cattle", "discontinued breeding with offspring from seropositive cows", "chemotherapeutical treatment of female offspring" and "vaccination of all female cattle". Each parameter in the module that was considered to be uncertain, was described using probability distributions. The simulations were run with 20, 000 iterations over a time period of 25 years. The median annual losses due to N. caninum in the Swiss dairy cow population were estimated to be euro 9. 7 million euros.

40|$|Worldwide, {{more than}} three billion people cook with wood, coal and other solid fuels on open fires or {{traditional}} stoves, contributing to more than 1. 5 million deaths annually and a multitude of negative economic and environmental impacts. The aim {{of this article is}} to present the costs and benefits of interventions to reduce indoor air pollution by halving the global population currently lacking access to (1) cleaner fuels (liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)) and (2) cleaner-burning and more efficient stoves. Results are presented for 11 world subregions. Annual costs and benefits of the two interventions are modelled from 2005 until 2015. Intervention costs include fuel, stove, and programme costs, from which monetary fuel cost savings are subtracted to estimate net costs. Eco-nomic benefits include less expenditure on health care, health-related productivity gains, fuel col-lection and cooking time savings, and environmental impacts. Globally, annual economic benefits of halving the population without access to LPG amount to (US) $ 91 billion at a net cost of $ 13 billion. The improved stove intervention generates $ 105 billion in economic benefits at a negative net cost of $ 34 billion. The resulting <b>benefit–cost</b> <b>ratios</b> (<b>BCR)</b> for both interventions are favourable. The BCR for LPG ranges from 1. 5 to 21. 2 in rural areas, and from 2. 6 to negative in urban areas. The BCR for improved stoves is negative in all sub-regions, as fuel cost savings exceed intervention costs, thus giving net negative costs.

The key average annual impacts of the cotton checkoff program on U. S. and foreign cotton and man-made fiber markets and their associated textile markets are reported. The results show that the returns to cotton producers as well as to cotton importers from the cotton checkoff program are positive. The average discounted <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios</b> (<b>BCR)</b> for the cotton checkoff program were found to be 5. 7 for domestic cotton producers and 14. 4 for importers. The higher BCR for importers reflects revenue gains not only from additional sales of cotton fiber textiles but also from additional “spillover” sales of man-made fiber textiles prompted by the cotton checkoff program. The results also show that U. S. taxpayers are better off because the cotton checkoff program has tended to reduce government outlays directed to cotton farmers. The analysis also finds that neither U. S. producers nor importers pay the full cost of the checkoff assessments.

This feasibility {{is determined by}} assessing net present values (NPV), internal rates of return (IRR), <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios</b> (<b>BCR)</b> and payback periods (PBP). In addition, the production costs are compared to the costs of reference energy systems, petrol, diesel and pellets. Low and intermediate input systems are considered and {{specific attention is paid}} to the opportunity cost of labour, by considering both family labour (no labour costs) and hired labour. The results show that all family labour settings have positive NPVs and high IRR and BCR values. Moreover, cassava has the highest family labour NPV (2900 – 5800 US ha 1) and the shortest PBP, but the required investment costs are high in comparision with the other crops. If hired labour is used, the NPV of eucalyptus is highest (380 – 1400 / ha 1), and it is also the least sensitive to changes in wages and yields. Jatropha performs best only for the indicator IRR and only with family labour or low labour opportunity costs. The analysis and comparison of bioenergy production costs shows that eucalyptus pellets (2. 6 – 3. 1 GJ 1) are competitive compared with reference pellets at current market prices (5 GJ 1). Jatropha SVO (19 GJ 1) and cassava ethanol (19 – 36 GJ 1) are only competitive with fossil diesel (21 GJ 1) and petrol (25 GJ 1) in a family labour setting. At current values jatropha biodiesel (24 – 37 GJ 1) is not competitive. The economic performance is sensitive to variations in crop yields and yield data are highly uncertain.

To investigate the most suitable method for low-income areas in China, we conducted a health economic analysis comparing three methods: visual inspection with acetic acid and Lugol’s iodine (VIA/VILI), ThinPrep cytology test (TCT), and human papillomavirus (HPV) test. Methods We recruited 3086 women aged 35 – 65 years using cluster random sampling. Each participant was {{randomly assigned to one}} of three cervical cancer screening groups: VIA/VILI, TCT, or HPV test. In order to calculate the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted by each screening method, we used Markov models to estimate the natural development of cervical cancer over a 15 -year period to estimate the age of onset and duration of each disease stage. The cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), net present values (NPVs), <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios</b> (<b>BCRs),</b> and cost-utility <b>ratios</b> (CURs) were used as outcomes in the health economic analysis. Results The positive detection rate in the VIA/VILI group was 1. 39 %, which was 4. 6 and 2. 0 times higher than the rates in the TCT and HPV test groups, respectively. The positive predictive value of VIA/VILI (10. 53 %) was highest while the rate of referral for colposcopy was lowest for those in the HPV[*]+[*]TCT group (0. 60 %). VIA/VILI performed the best in terms of health economic evaluation results, as the cost of per positive case detected was 8467. 9 RMB, which was 24503. 0 RMB lower than that for TCT and 5755. 9 RMB lower than that for the HPV test. In addition, the NPV and BCR values were 258011. 5 RMB and 3. 18 (the highest), and the CUR was 2341. 8 RMB (the lowest). The TCT performed the worst, since its NPV was < 0 and the BCR was < 1, indicative of being poorly cost-beneficial. Conclusions With the best economic evaluation results and requiring minimum medical resources, VIA/VILI is recommended for cervical cancer screening in poverty-stricken areas in China with high incidence of cervical cancer and lack of medical resources...|$|R

Its recent growth dominates Nigerian non-oil economic growth. Small-scale, semi-commercial farms, settled agricultural households and transhumant pastoralists dominate production. Livestock is the second largest agricultural sub-sector and features 16. 43 million cattle, 34. 69 million sheep, 55. 15 million goats, 7. 18 million pigs and 183. 16 million poultry. These provide nutrition and food security, {{and a range of}} services including draught power for cropping activities. Poor animal productivity is widely attributed to the occurrence and endemicity of certain animal diseases. These are often unreported, unconfirmed or poorly documented. The financial losses associated with such outbreaks and costs associated with the disease burden are also rarely documented. Efforts at control of such animal diseases have yielded poor returns due to ineffective or absent control programs, insufficient inputs (such as vaccines), poor vaccination coverage due to limited vaccine supplies and constraints in field mobility and support funds, illiteracy of farmers and poor management systems. In preparation for the World Bank’s Integrated Animal and Human Health Management project for Nigeria, estimates of the economic and financial implications of high disease burden, morbidity and mortality and the costs of implementing various interventions, for all or a combination of priority diseases were required. The Government of Nigeria invited ILRI to provide such estimates for priority diseases: NCD in rural poultry flocks; PPR in sheep and goats; CBPP in cattle; ASF in pigs; and trypanosomosis in ruminants and pigs. For these diseases, and across agroecological zones, the study’s objectives were to: • assess the direct and indirect financial burden of inaction; • estimate the costs of targeted interventions; • determine the additional benefits, additional costs and net benefits associated with interventions; • evaluate of the <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios</b> (<b>BCRs)</b> of targeted interventions; and • make recommendations on the feasibility of the targeted interventions. The study featured epidemiology and economic components. Spreadsheet-based economic modelling was effectively combined with participatory epidemiological fieldwork and analysis, and both national and international specialists contributed. Both primary and secondary data were obtained, and stakeholder consultations and expert interviews were conducted. An extensive literature review was compiled. World Ban...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted with}} three wheat varieties of varying seed sizes at five seed rates in medium and high management at Wheat Research Centre, Dinajpur during 2004 - 05 Rabi season to determine the appropriate seed rates for the varieties under different management practices. On an average, high management increased grain yield by 18. 4 %, but the <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratio</b> (<b>BCR)</b> was higher in medium management. Higher grain yield was obtained from varieties Shatabdi (medium sized seed) and Prodip (large sized seed) compared to Sufi (small sized seed) in high management, whereas in medium management, all the varieties produced similar grain yield. Considering yield performance and BCR analysis, the seed rates of Sufi and Shatabdi might be 100 and 120 kg/ha, respectively, for both the managements. Seed rates of Prodip might be 120 and 140 kg/ha for medium and high management, respectively...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} of hedgerow intercropping of pigeonpea with rice and mungbean followed by blackgram and groundnut, respectively, as alley crops {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of hedgerow crop on the yield of alley crops, the productivity of hedgerow crop and its contribution to the alley crops. Alley cropping of rice-blackgram and mungbean-groundnut crop sequences with 1. 5 and 2. 5 m hedgerow distance of pigeonpea along with sole cropping sequences were evaluated. Grain yield of all crops were affected by hedgerow intercropping systems. Significantly highest rice equivalent yields and gross returns were obtained by hedgerow intercropping systems with 2. 5 m hedgerow distance for both the crop sequences in both 1995 and 1996. The highest gross margin and the highest <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratio</b> (<b>BCR)</b> were resulted from hedgerow intercropping at 2. 5 m distance with rice-blackgram crop sequence and the system was found profitable...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{scenario of}} growing Hybrid (Alok 6201) {{and two other}} modern HYVs is presented in this study. Attempt was taken to describe the nature of input use, costs structure and comparative profitability of BRRI varieties and Hybrid rice in two different locations of Bangladesh. The study was conducted during winter (Boro) season of 1999. Analysis showed that, costs of production of Hybrid rice was about 28 % higher than BRRI Dhan 29 and 35 % higher than BR 14. Gross return was found higher for BRRI Dhan 29 (Tk 46014 ha - 1) leading to pay better economic return. The net return and <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratio</b> (<b>BCR)</b> were also substantially higher for BRRI Dhan 29 {{compared to that of}} other two varieties. Applying the partial budgeting technique, the study further confirmed that BRRI Dhan 29 is more profitable than Hybrid (Alok 6201) and BR 14. In terms of consumers`choice also, Hybrid rice appeared to be a less preferred dietary item...|$|E
40|$|Main points • The {{simulation}} study {{detailed in}} this report predicts significant crash reductions {{with the introduction of}} forward collision avoidance technology (FCAT) systems. • Between 20 and 40 per cent of all fatal crashes and between 30 and 50 per cent of all injury crashes might be prevented with FCAT systems (note that these figures do not account for any unreliability in operation). • The estimates are consistent with previous studies that have suggested reductions of up to and in excess of 40 per cent. • The greatest estimated benefit is from a system that combines long and short range sensing. • Systems with expansive fields of view and that are highly reactive have a greater theoretical effect, but may suffer from the problem of false-positive responses. • A narrow field of view that reduces the chance of false-positive interventions appears to provide substantial benefit; the results of such a system were comparable to a system with a wide field of view. • Estimated <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios</b> (<b>BCR)</b> for passenger vehicles are marginal at less than one in most instances, due to high system costs and declining per-vehicle crash rates. However, a halving of system costs would see BCRs exceed one. • Heavy vehicle BCRs are much higher: between 2. 7 and 9. 8. Recommendations • Encourage the uptake of FCAT systems by heavy vehicle operators and in passenger vehicle markets as soon as possible. • Liaise with industry groups such as the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries and the Truck Industry Council with a view to finding pathways for the wider-scale introduction of FCAT technologies. • In programs such as the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP), provide substantial credit for the installation of effective FCAT systems. • Encourage the creation of performance standards for such systems, to ensure uniformly high effectiveness, and to provide a means of assessment by ANCAP. • Monitoring and evaluation of systems as they are introduced, to confirm or otherwise the benefits of the systems that have been estimated via simulation in this study and similar studies.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims at {{analyzing the}} effects of various assumptions that may affect the upstream transmission {{of the benefits of}} commodity checkoff programs. Despite the amount of econometric research on evaluation of {{the effects of}} checkoff programs for producer benefits, little empirical research has focused on the various simplifying assumptions often made in those analyses that may influence the rate and extent of the retail-to-farm transmission of generic advertising and promotion effects. The first part of this study is a qualitative analysis of the world soybean and soybean products markets. Then the conceptual model is proposed and discussed. A model of world soybean and soybean markets has been developed which relaxes all of the simplifying assumptions often made in analyses of commodity checkoff programs. The model is used to analyze the implications of those assumptions for the upstream transmission of the returns of the soybean checkoff program to producers. After estimating the econometric parameters of the model, the model has been simulated over history as a means of model validation. Then the model has been simulated again assuming that the U. S. soybean checkoff program had not existed over history. The differences from the simulation results by the baseline simulation are considered as the base case against which all other simulation results are compared. The base case results indicate that the soybean checkoff program has been highly effective over the study period returning $ 6. 9 in revenue to soybean producers for every checkoff dollar spent. This upstream transmission of the benefits of the soybean checkoff program is analyzed through a series of simulations with the world soybean model in which the simplifying assumptions made by other checkoff program analyses. These are imposed on the model including the assumptions of no supply response, no price response, no government intervention, no free riders, no domestic supply chain linkages, no global supply chain linkages, no checkoff investments in production research and no promotion programs at multiple levels of the supply chain. The results of the scenario simulations provide the evidence that simplifying assumptions made in checkoff program analyses can seriously bias the calculation of the <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios</b> (<b>BCRs)</b> for checkoff programs. Some assumptions have a tendency of overestimating the BCR for checkoff programs while others have a tendency of underestimating the BCR calculation. The implication of these findings is that analyses of checkoff programs must consider carefully the simplifying assumptions made to avoid seriously under- or over-estimating the returns of those programs to producers...|$|R
